1
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,842
There's the bridge.

2
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,549
And the train tracks are just there.

3
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,180
This is the way? 
Yes.


4
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:11,615
And from there, which way is north?

5
00:07:11,616 --> 00:07:14,886
That side.

6
00:07:14,887 --> 00:07:16,992
We walk there?

7
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,774
You going to
the United States?

8
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,008
Yes.

9
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,547
Yeah, right .

10
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:38,346
- Thank you .
- I hope it all works out .

11
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:40,615
- Thank you .
- Take care .

12
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:42,027
Thank you.

13
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,905
Now do everything I do .

14
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:39,515
Eyes open !
Pay attention !

15
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:41,393
Come here!

16
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,468
Come on! Let's get up?
Quick !

17
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:50,994
We take this?

18
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:54,341
Wake up!
Don't just stand there, man !

19
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:59,316
Move!

20
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,019
The last .

21
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,349
Come on you !
Shit !

22
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,618
You said you'd go up
first.

23
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,355
I was ready to climb
and you just stood there .

24
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:17,024
And what do you want ?
We run up over you?

25
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,435
Wake up, man.

26
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,034
The train has left us
back here and it was your fault .

27
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,603
I don't want to return to Guatemala.
Here, it's very good.

28
00:09:57,604 --> 00:10:00,342
But further north ,
is really cool.

29
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,977
This is pretty good.

30
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,315
Look .

31
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:10,519
And you , Juan?
what do you want to do over there?

32
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,625
If I tell you, it won't happen .

33
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:36,487
- And what is this guy ?
- I dunno ...

34
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,329
He's gone.

35
00:12:18,064 --> 00:12:20,132
Guys!
Here comes the train!

36
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,977
Run!

37
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,814
Run!

38
00:12:31,512 --> 00:12:33,618
Now, it's easy!

39
00:12:47,464 --> 00:12:49,034
Run! 

40
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,507

45
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:04,288
Up !

46
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,190
Osvaldo ...

47
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:39,860
Samuel ...

48
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,630
Juan .

49
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:17,804
It's hot !

50
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,481
Super hot .

51
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:25,544
- I'm at the top .
- It burns!

52
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:28,458
How to cool it , no?
- Oh , I'll drive it .

53
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:35,988
You're crazy .
Shit , move !

54
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:39,091
You can see everything
from up here . Amazing !

55
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,862
Here you can see the mountains .

56
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:43,740
Careful you don't fall .

57
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:47,141
That's cool !

58
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,105
Thank you.

59
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,078
Thank you.

Seventy -nine .

67
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:41,204
What you got?

68
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:58,360
Where are you going?

69
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:02,353
She's going to see her boyfriend .

70
00:18:02,354 --> 00:18:04,422
I think she likes him .

71
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,404
He'll snake you, man.

72
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:09,662
Are you hungry ?

73
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:11,530
Want to eat ?

74
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:12,868
Yes ?

75
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:15,605
Come on.

76
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:17,570
I'm not sharing my food
with him .

77
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:19,774
He didn't help us at all.

78
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,621
You too, man . You haven't helped
anything. And are eating.

79
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:35,995
Take it.

80
00:18:47,605 --> 00:18:49,448
Want some water ?

81
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:52,011
Here.

82
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,490
What?

83
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,529
Why's he meddling this guy?

84
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,769
He's not even aware of it .

85
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,047
- Here ?
- Calm . Relax .

86
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,744
My Heart ?

87
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,046
My heart is fine.

88
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,527
Well

89
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:27,891
How you say?

90
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:38,771
And your heart ?

91
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:44,515
What is " lek " ?

92
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:52,782
What's " lek " mean?
Only " lek " even alone ?

93
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:56,150
Oh, yeah !

What are you doing here?
Stop following us.

100
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,595
Leave the guy alone.

101
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:38,630
You're not nice.

102
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:40,799
Oh , these are very good .

103
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,478
Did we get enough to
pay for two of them ?

104
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:47,240
Very good .

105

So yeah, we do.
And then think about it .

Could you not pull any other face?

119
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,560
Oh ! This guy seems ugly
anyway , Indian .

120
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,593
Give him , man.

Why defend this guy ?
He's not with us .

Anyone who is not smart
will be left behind.

00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,917
Got that?

175
00:26:57,361 --> 00:26:58,698
Why?

176

I'm done traveling
with this Indian.

182
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:49,321
We share all three, understood?

If you start, I'm leaving.

00:29:17,787 --> 00:29:20,198
For me,
it's both or none.

191
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,748

Time to wake up .

I can not .

203
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:27,808
This idiot thinks
that he can kill just by talking .

Tell them to make a big pile .

241

<i> Do not cry
because nobody is eternal

342
01:04:55,111 --> 01:05:00,925
Nobody returns from the deep sleep

343
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:21,375
And what Italian football team
is your favorite ?

344
01:07:21,376 --> 01:07:23,889

And what are you doing here ?

350
01:08:05,693 --> 01:08:07,761
Going up north .

351
01:08:07,762 --> 01:08:09,708
So am I.

352
01:08:13,368 --> 01:08:16,015
You miss
Guatemala ?

353
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:19,854
- No.
- No? I miss it a lot .

354
01:08:21,043 --> 01:08:23,880
How much money have you got to cross ?

01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:25,614
- A hundred .
- Hundred ?

356
01:08:25,615 --> 01:08:28,885
Dude, that won't be enough
to even pay the " coyote " .

357
01:08:28,886 --> 01:08:32,089
Look I have a cousin
who has a business .

358
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,690
Nothing big.

359
01:08:33,691 --> 01:08:35,926
But it pays well .

360
01:08:35,927 --> 01:08:39,271
- And what's the job?
- A porter .

361
01:09:26,885 --> 01:09:29,264
You could stay there
if you want.

362
01:09:42,236 --> 01:09:44,037
Okay, Vitamina?

363

- How many?
- Thirteen .

364

- Do't spend it all .
- Okay .

366
01:09:55,884 --> 01:09:57,886
Leave your backpacks
Here in the middle.

Each of you will give me a
number of a person in the U.S. .

370
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,768
If you cooperate ,
you'll leave here alive .

371
01:10:11,769 --> 01:10:13,838
Where do you come from ?

In the corner , all alone.

379
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:36,764
El Salvador ?

380
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:39,644
Hands against the wall.
Frisk them .

381
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:46,875
Look .

I am also in Zone 3 .

383
01:10:50,147 --> 01:10:51,454
Go away .

What are you waiting for?
Go away .

385

You're from where?

387

He stays.  You leave.

The rest of you , turn around,
hands on the wall.

Very high,
so I can see them .

391
01:11:21,682 --> 01:11:23,716
Who will be the first
to give me the number ?

392
01:11:23,717 --> 01:11:25,019
You ?

393
01:12:37,802 --> 01:12:39,202
What do you want ?

394
01:12:39,203 --> 01:12:41,138

01:12:47,346 --> 01:12:48,723
A tough little kid .

01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,589
Vitamina , someone's looking
for you .

399
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:59,759
<i> As the boss said , asshole ,

- Who?
- The Indian .

405

How do you know ?

406

He speaks no Spanish .

407
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:27,089
Why so much affection
for this little Indian ?

408
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:28,593
I owe him one .

409

Answer me, you little shit !

This is the price of your friend?

412
01:13:59,427 --> 01:14:01,161
Move in!

413
01:14:01,162 --> 01:14:02,763
A problem boss ?

He came to pays a ransom for the freedom
of his friend.

415
01:14:05,001 --> 01:14:06,639
Look, at that, what fortune.

416
01:14:07,303 --> 01:14:08,805
Where'd you get that ?

417
01:14:09,773 --> 01:14:12,375
- Earned it .

418
01:14:12,376 --> 01:14:14,244

423
01:14:26,959 --> 01:14:28,404
You too!

424
01:14:31,665 --> 01:14:33,708
Look into the eyes of one another.

425
01:14:35,869 --> 01:14:39,238
That's what will happen .
Only one will leave.

426
01:14:39,239 --> 01:14:41,447
And you will decide who .

427
01:14:42,209 --> 01:14:43,711
Get it?

428
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:47,486
Who goes ?
You ? Or will he?

429
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,528
Who will leave?

430
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,955
Answer me, you little shit !

431
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:55,256
Him

Very well .

433
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,637
So be it .

434
01:15:07,104 --> 01:15:08,550
A. ..

435
01:15:12,477 --> 01:15:13,979
Two ...

436
01:15:24,323 --> 01:15:26,259
What guts , huh ?

437
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,763
You're a little man.

438
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:32,266
You have twenty seconds
to leave.

439
01:15:32,267 --> 01:15:33,633
Fast !

440
01:15:33,634 --> 01:15:35,636
Before I change my mind .

441
01:15:35,637 --> 01:15:38,277
Out !

442
01:15:40,342 --> 01:15:41,650
Open the door .

443
01:20:00,938 --> 01:20:03,248
Ah , " taiv " means snow,
then?

444
01:22:00,406 --> 01:22:02,774
How's it going?

445
01:22:02,775 --> 01:22:04,717
We're going to Los Angeles .

446
01:22:07,582 --> 01:22:09,653
How old?
- I am 16 .

447
01:22:33,143 --> 01:22:34,521
Okay?

448
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:52,130
Take this .

449
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,610
Put on the backpacks .

450
01:23:04,745 --> 01:23:06,123
Inside.

451
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:08,982
Come on!

452
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,327
Quiet , huh ?

453
01:23:41,254 --> 01:23:43,088
The Police is there.

454
01:23:43,089 --> 01:23:45,233
We'll have to wait for
the shift change .

455
01:25:03,781 --> 01:25:05,124
They're gone .

456
01:25:05,883 --> 01:25:07,488
Now then , let's go!

457
01:25:36,986 --> 01:25:38,286
On the floor .

458
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:49,232
Nobody move ,
fuckers .

459
01:26:00,278 --> 01:26:01,578
Get up !

460
01:26:09,522 --> 01:26:11,559
On the floor ! On the floor !

461
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:24,472
Up ! Come on!

462
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,705
Now !

463
01:27:21,604 --> 01:27:23,972
Runs , Chauk ! Come on!

Fast ! Run!

465

Fast !

466
01:28:02,551 --> 01:28:06,556
It feels like there's
a zoo in my stomach .

467
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:11,192
As if a lot of animals

468
01:28:11,193 --> 01:28:13,495
were running
all over my body ...

469
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:16,109
The thrill of being finally passing
to the other side .

470
01:28:17,634 --> 01:28:19,215
I feel that ...

471
01:28:19,216 --> 01:28:22,513
everything we will see on the
other side will be full of good.

472
01:28:32,551 --> 01:28:34,152
Everything will be alright ...

473
01:28:34,153 --> 01:28:36,794
and we get
up and go where we want .

474
01:29:01,117 --> 01:29:03,256
Fast, little fuckers !

475
01:29:30,350 --> 01:29:32,057
Pass me the backpacks .

476
01:29:37,592 --> 01:29:39,859
You have arrived to
the other side now.

477
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:41,160
Come on!

478
01:30:01,385 --> 01:30:02,865
And now ?

479
01:30:07,792 --> 01:30:09,272
Come on.

480
01:31:39,931 --> 01:31:41,231
Chauk !

481
01:31:41,232 --> 01:31:43,178
Chauk , get up!
