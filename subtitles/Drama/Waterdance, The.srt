1
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,163
Hi, honey.

2
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,671
Hi.

3
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,178
Oh, I'm sorry.

4
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,498
Dr. Shapiro to radiology.

5
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,206
Dr. Shapiro,
please report to radiology.

6
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:16,223
- Hey, Joel. I'm Les, man.
- Pleasure.

7
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,023
Sorry I'm late, man.

8
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,731
Man, these people around here got
me running around like a dog.

9
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,029
Broke your neck, huh?

10
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,532
I was hoping
no one would notice.

11
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,035
That halo's
a dead giveaway, man.

12
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,538
How'd it happen?
Hiking accident.

13
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:40,748
Damn!
Out enjoying nature.

14
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,052
So, what do you do
for a living, Joel?

15
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,054
I'm a writer.

16
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,056
Is that right?

17
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,559
I'm a Stephen King man myself.

18
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,561
You like him?
He's fast.

19
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,564
Yeah, he's something else, man.

20
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,567
You got your hands?

21
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,571
It's all right, man. Don't sweat it.
They got computers, right?

22
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,278
You can type with your tongue.

23
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,623
Les!

24
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:06,129
Cincinnati trails 3-1.
They push one run across.

25
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:10,838
Three-one delivery...
Baby's comin' home

26
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,342
Les!

27
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,144
Be right back, man.

28
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,851
I am!

29
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,332
I am!

30
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,138
I am!

31
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,141
Les, I am!

32
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,143
Les, Vernon's calling you.

33
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,645
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Maybe I oughta teach him your name.

34
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,648
Joel, this is Rosa.
Rosa, this is Joel. Hi, Joel.

35
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,151
Les! See, the way it
works around here...

36
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,154
Is she's got the certificate,
but I really do all the work.

37
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,656
Don't listen to him.
He's always complaining.

38
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,160
Just stating the facts, ma'am.
Just stating the facts.

39
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,368
I am!
Hey, Jimmy, how ya doin'?

40
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,171
Mr. Gibson, hope they
had you up walking.

41
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,673
Oh, you know they did.

42
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,677
Rosita, Rosita,
eres tan bonita.

43
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,180
Victor! Flirting
in front of your wife?

44
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,682
Shame on you.

45
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,186
Um, everybody,
say hello to Joel.

46
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,188
He'll be with us for a while.

47
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,190
I am!
The guy almost kills me,

48
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,192
and he sends me
fucking candy, mom.

49
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,694
They look really
expensive, Bloss.

50
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,197
Did you see the card?
The card is really nice.

51
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,200
Mommy, what do you want? You want me
to send him a fucking thank-you note?

52
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,203
Les, I am!

53
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,705
I'm here, Vernon.

54
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,208
Don't worry about that.
You'll get used to it.

55
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,211
I'll go get your bed.
Les!

56
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,713
Yeah, look, I just wanna
talk to my woman.

57
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,216
A man has got a right to talk
to his woman, doesn't he?

58
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,219
No, I don't wanna hold!
Shit, I'm... shit. I am!

59
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,223
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, Vernon,
if you don't shut the fuck up!

60
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,725
I'm gonna slap you silly
if you don't shut the fuck up.

61
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,727
He does it just
to bother me, mom.

62
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,731
Rosa, we got to do something about these
phone people. I can't even call my woman.

63
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,734
I know, Raymond.
Well, it's frustrating.

64
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,238
Rosa! I need you in 57 right now.
Just a second.

65
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,740
If you need anything, just holler, okay?
I'll be back.

66
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,245
Mom. Mom, I'm interested
in stories, okay? What?

67
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,453
I am! I am!

68
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,254
Ready to put you through.
It's about time.

69
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,256
What the hell y'all doing
over there, playing dominoes?

70
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,759
There's no need
for sarcasm, sir.

71
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,761
I am!

72
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,969
Signorelli's pizza.
Gotta put you on hold.

73
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,768
Now this is ridiculous.

74
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,271
Mama, please, look.
Did you get the lawyer?

75
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,275
Well, I tell ya, I tried, Bloss, but I couldn't
get that blond off the phone today.

76
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,777
Did you know she's going out
with that Arthur again?

77
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,780
Yeah, mom, you told me.
I did? I told you?

78
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,782
You told me.
She's sleeping with an army a week,

79
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,784
mom! And she's still
leading the man on.

80
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,287
Mom, look, we gotta get this
lawyer thing arranged, mom.

81
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,995
Les!
I swear to God, Vernon!

82
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,800
Got you in the halo, huh?

83
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,303
Yeah, man, I call that thing
a crown of thorns.

84
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,306
I thought they was gonna screw
that thing right into my brain.

85
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,809
How you doing? My name is Raymond hill.
My friends call me Ray.

86
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,517
Joel. Nice to meet you, Joel.
Nice to meet you.

87
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,316
Oh, this here?
Yeah, well,

88
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,318
crazy man chewed it off
in a fight.

89
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,321
But that was in my lawless days.
Look, Joel, if you need anything...

90
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,323
glass of water, something
from the snack bar, Les!

91
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,326
Anything like that...
you just call on me, okay?

92
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,033
- Thanks.
- All right.

93
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,832
It's a hard knock,
isn't it, buddy?

94
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,837
Yeah, but one thing you got
to remember through it all...

95
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,340
Is that God got his plan.

96
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,845
Now take me, for instance.
I mean, I got a wife, a beautiful child.

97
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:21,351
I was treatin' 'em bad, you
know... lyin', cheatin', drinkin'.

98
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,855
I guess God just slowed me down now so I
can appreciate 'em. Know what I mean?

99
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,359
I am, Les, I am!
Goddamn!

100
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,361
Pile of brain sludge!

101
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,864
Les!

102
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:39,573
Les, I am.

103
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,373
That was not nice.

104
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,376
I should get you out of bed...

105
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,878
And make you apologize
to that poor man right now.

106
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,880
Hey, hey, there you are.

107
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,384
How you doing? Raymond hill.
My friends call me Ray.

108
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,887
Hi, I'm Anna.
Well, it's nice to meet you, Anna.

109
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,390
You two are married, huh?

110
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,892
No, we're friends.

111
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,396
Oh, excuse me. I saw the ring.
And I just...

112
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,399
I'm married.
You are?

113
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,402
Oh, right, right.
How is Donald?

114
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,406
David.
His name is David.

115
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:20,910
Oh, I gotcha. Yeah, Raymond
hill understands these matters.

116
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,120
Ooh! You're a lucky man
there, Joel.

117
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,421
A very perceptive guy.
Yeah.

118
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,923
Friends, huh?

119
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,925
Well, I like you.

120
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,928
I'm back, gentlemen.

121
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,930
Boy, did we miss you, nursey.

122
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,933
Love you too, Bloss. Hey, we're gonna
have that bed in five minutes.

123
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,436
I won't move.

124
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,439
Mr. Gibson,
ready to get in bed?

125
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,441
Oh, you know I am.

126
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,443
Let's do it.

127
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,946
I went over a couple of chapters, but you
don't wanna start back so soon, do you?

128
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,154
There's not much else to do.

129
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,657
I brought you...

130
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,161
These.

131
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,463
Kinda quiet in here, isn't it?

132
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,670
Yeah, very unusual.
Yeah.

133
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,175
Very unusual.

134
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,680
Be right back.

135
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,486
Thanks.

136
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,692
Shit.

137
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,197
Vernon's not breathing.
Call the code.

138
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,207
Pulse?

139
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,006
He's back.

140
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,714
Okay, respiration is spontaneous.
Let's get him to I.C.U.

141
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,235
What are you thinking?

142
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,034
Did you tell Donald?

143
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,741
David?

144
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,745
Yeah, of course I did.

145
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,249
I mean, about us.

146
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,754
I'm going to.

147
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,559
I should go.

148
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,266
It's late. Okay?

149
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,776
Good night.

150
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,288
Anna.
Hmm?

151
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,088
You seem to be taking
all this rather well.

152
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,795
Oh!

153
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,799
Sleep well.

154
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,604
If he died, I mean,
there could be murder charges,

155
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,107
then we'd have to be called
in as witnesses. Bullshit.

156
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,610
It's not bullshit.
That's the truth.

157
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,612
You know this hospital
isn't concerned about you.

158
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,115
Take care, beautiful.
Good night.

159
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,323
At least, manslaughter.
Shut up, Raymond.

160
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:13,169
Well, I think I should be more
depressed than I am, but I'm not.

161
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,654
Why is that?

162
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:19,158
My mom and my sister came to
visit when I was in intensive,

163
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:22,661
but I was... I was so high on
morphine, I didn't really notice.

164
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:28,167
I couldn't really tell who they were, which
pretty much sums up my family, I guess.

165
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:31,170
It's a nice sweater you've got on there.
Do all shrinks wear sweaters?

166
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,674
I remember Judd Hirsch had a nice
sweater on inordinary people.

167
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:39,178
I really rely mainly
on my girlfriend in this.

168
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:42,681
Yeah, she is nice.
She's great.

169
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,388
She's a great girl.
Smart, funny.

170
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:49,688
Unfortunately, she's married
to someone else, so...

171
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:53,192
...that he does not know
what's really going on.

172
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:56,695
It's really... it's not my problem.
He's her problem.

173
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,698
And... she's my problem.

174
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:02,201
And... now there's
this problem, so...

175
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,703
what, uh, what are you
writing there?

176
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:07,706
Well, you know,
I'm-I'm-I'm hopeful.

177
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:10,209
I am. I'm hopeful.

178
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:14,213
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm anticipating a psychological crash.

179
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:16,215
I have it penciled
into my calendar already.

180
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:19,218
I think it happens, you know,
next week sometime.

181
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:21,720
You know, I'm a writer.
That's what I do.

182
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,224
And I don't need to walk
to do that.

183
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:30,433
So, uh, this is denial,
right, doc?

184
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:38,737
Hey, Victor.
How you doing?

185
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,739
Bien, bien.

186
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:44,243
I have five months of this.

187
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,745
Well, it could be worse.
It could be your cooking.

188
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:50,749
Anna, I never cooked.
I heated.

189
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:52,751
How we doing, Mr.
Gibson? All right.

190
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:55,959
Yeah, I figured that.
How you doing, nurse?

191
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:00,759
Here you go, Ray.

192
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:04,263
Sorry, man, but that was the
last extra one they had.

193
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,970
You have to go with what
the good lord gives you.

194
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,476
Fish is pretty good, huh, Joel?

195
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,777
You'll think so too after a few months.
Macradenal.

196
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,779
Wh-what about a painkiller?
I want a painkiller.

197
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:25,488
Later.
Enjoy your fish.

198
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:30,789
Oyeles, mi amigo.

199
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:35,498
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I almost forgot.
Teatro de kung fu, right?

200
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:39,298
Wait a minute, man.
Oh, come on, Bloss, man.

201
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:42,801
You know that every time we vote on this
stuff, it always ends up the same way.

202
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:47,306
Oh, yeah? In case you haven't noticed,
there's another patient in the room.

203
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,808
Not to mention, one less Mexican.
Eh, amigo?

204
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,311
Why don't we take
ourselves another vote?

205
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,813
All right, you wanna vote,
we'll vote.

206
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:58,817
We already know your vote.
Victor, we know your vote.

207
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,320
Mr. Gibson,
what do you say?

208
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,323
Les, you know me.
Whatever's on is all right with me.

209
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:07,826
All right, fair enough.
Ray, what you say?

210
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:10,829
Don't like football
and I don't like kung fu.

211
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:15,834
Okay, we have three abstentions, we
got one kung fu, we got one football.

212
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,337
Joel, it's on you, man.

213
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,839
Uh, yeah, I'll just give
my vote to you, Les.

214
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:23,342
Yeah, great.
We're gonna have to flip a coin.

215
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:28,347
Flip a coin, my ass. Hey, we gotta
stick together on this thing, Joe.

216
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:31,850
I-I don't really
watch tv.

217
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,559
Ain't about tv, man. It's about
football, man. Motherfuckin' raiders!

218
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:42,361
Listen, around here, you and me,
we gotta stick together, man.

219
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:44,363
What are you talking about?

220
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:50,573
I'm talking about not letting these niggers
and spicks take over this room, man.

221
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,373
My last name is Garcia, Bloss.

222
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:59,082
Joel Garcia.

223
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,587
Hey, hey, come on,
big guy, call it.

224
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:09,888
You should channel this hostility
in a more positive direction.

225
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:13,392
You're a little prick,
you know that, man?

226
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:17,896
Come on, Bloss.
Heads or tails, man.

227
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:21,104
Heads.

228
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:26,109
Tails it is, man.

229
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,912
Whoo! Garcia!
Garcia?

230
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:39,622
Oh, boy, that's deep.
That is deep.

231
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,922
Les...

232
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:46,629
I am.

233
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:49,428
Guess who's in
the private room.

234
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:52,135
I am.

235
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:00,572
Here we go.

236
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,146
Ready to roll.

237
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,945
Gonna have to buy me one
of those vans with a lift.

238
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:09,448
All right. Okay.
You clear over there?

239
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:11,450
Yeah, I'm good.
All right.

240
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,953
You okay?
Yes, I'm fine.

241
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:18,457
Whoo! Whoo!

242
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:23,962
Cheryl, get him... get him
under the chair. Now.

243
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,465
Looks a little pale.
Are you okay?

244
00:19:26,615 --> 00:19:28,967
Maybe a little dizzy, but...

245
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:30,969
get that chair
under him, Cheryl!

246
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,473
I got him.
It's nothing to worry about.

247
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:37,180
Here he goes.

248
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:43,186
Joel. Joel?

249
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:48,487
Here he is.

250
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:53,696
Ah, better wait on that van.
Mm-hmm.

251
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:52,255
Make way, harley!

252
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:57,556
Ooh, you're so pitiful.
Pitiful! Fuck you!

253
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:01,560
You're pitiful.
You know you're so pitiful.

254
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,062
Shut the fuck up!

255
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:07,065
What's the matter, harley,
you running out of gas?

256
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:09,067
Uh-oh. Uh-oh!

257
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:11,069
Come on, harley.
I'm gonna wait for you.

258
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:14,573
Come on, baby.

259
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:17,576
Harley Davidson ain't shit
compared to a Cadillac.

260
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:22,785
Fuck you, motherfucker!

261
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:28,587
Whoo!

262
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:30,589
Yes, can I help you?

263
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:33,091
Yeah, hello?
That's mine.

264
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:35,093
Yeah, I've been waiting
for about ten minutes.

265
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:37,596
That's just the way things
are sometimes, isn't it?

266
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:39,802
Please hold. Wait.
Wait. No, no.

267
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:43,101
Forget it.

268
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:46,104
Hey there, Mr. Gibson.
How you doing? All right.

269
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:48,607
Wonderful. Wonderful.
Hi. How are you?

270
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,610
Hey. Psych!

271
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,613
Les!

272
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:59,117
Hey! Won't be too long before
the new bambino is here, huh?

273
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:02,120
That's wonderful.
You know, I got a little girl... Starletta.

274
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,624
Beautiful child.
There's a picture of her over there.

275
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:08,126
Les!

276
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,629
Rosa, why don't you go see
what Vernon wants?

277
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:13,632
It's not my name he's calling.

278
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:16,635
Les!

279
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,637
What's wrong with him, anyway?

280
00:22:18,787 --> 00:22:21,640
Broken neck, a head injury.

281
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,643
Kind of cut his vocabulary
to a minimum.

282
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:27,850
Les!

283
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,357
I'll be right back.

284
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:39,658
Les! Les!

285
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:42,661
Look, man, I'm all wet again.
Gizmo done busted.

286
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:44,663
Give me five minutes,
okay, Ray?

287
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:47,370
Okay. Okay.

288
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:57,676
Hey, how you doing
there, halo head?

289
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,678
So, you're a writer, huh?

290
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:03,682
- Some people think so.
- Yeah? Well, that's great.

291
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:07,686
That's great. You know, Raymond
hill is a man of many stories.

292
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:09,688
True things... make
your asshole go tight.

293
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:12,691
See, see, I was settled down
when this happened to me.

294
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:15,193
You know, just on my way
to buy a pack of cigarettes.

295
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:18,196
Two guys jumped me, beat the hell out
of me and throw me in the L.A. river.

296
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:21,199
Joel, ain't no water
in that river.

297
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:25,203
I mean, I have to admit, I was
kind of wild and kind of crazy.

298
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:28,206
Take this, for instance.
Now, you see this?

299
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:30,208
Crazy ass ho chopped it off
with a straight razor.

300
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:32,711
- I thought that a crazy
man chewed... - Joel!

301
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:36,715
You got to watch those women.
They're soul stealers.

302
00:23:36,865 --> 00:23:38,717
Now let's take that one
you got, for instance.

303
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:41,720
Now, she a pretty one,
but she's a soul stealer.

304
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,222
N-now no matter
what happens,

305
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:48,226
part of your soul is gonna be gone, so you
might as well be glad to give it on up.

306
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:50,729
You know, I do remember that.

307
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:53,231
I had one woman like that once.

308
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:56,735
Oh, she was a beauty. White woman.
Her name was Annabelle Lee.

309
00:23:56,885 --> 00:24:01,239
Stripper. Three weeks in a tiny
little bed in a tiny little room.

310
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:03,742
Ray. Ray, what do we
gotta do, man, huh?

311
00:24:03,892 --> 00:24:06,745
We gotta listen to your stories
all day and night, man?

312
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:09,748
Just mind your business, Bloss.
Me and this man here are talkin'.

313
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:12,250
You're talkin', man. He's being
polite while you're telling him lies.

314
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,253
- What lies? - Lies, man.
Just shut up.

315
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:18,256
You know, Bloss,
I'm gonna tell you something.

316
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:21,760
See, it don't matter to me none if you
keep your mind closed. That's okay.

317
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,763
But it does concern me when you
start libeling my good name.

318
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:27,265
Gonna do more
than libel your name, man.

319
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,267
This man got a problem
with the race.

320
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,770
I told him it's nothing
but ignorance and fear.

321
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,772
That's all it is...
ignorance and fear.

322
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:36,775
You're a writer, tell him.
Tell him! Ignorance and fear.

323
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:38,777
Fuck you!

324
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:41,780
Well, it could just be
a zinc deficiency.

325
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,782
That's exactly what I was
gonna say to him!

326
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:47,786
I told that man there. I said, "the black
man know how to please a white woman."

327
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:51,289
Hey, Ray, wh-where is this white woman if
she's in love with you? Where is she?

328
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,792
I don't know where she is,
bubblehead!

329
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:57,796
Oh, yeah. Mr. big shit
with all the women, man.

330
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:00,298
Your wife don't even
come to visit you, homey.

331
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:03,301
I'll tell you what, man.
Just to shut you the fuck up.

332
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:07,305
I'll wager good money that this
white bitch don't even exist,

333
00:25:07,455 --> 00:25:09,307
except in your fuckin'
black head, man.

334
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:11,309
Mm-hmm, fantasy island,
motherfucker.

335
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:13,812
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, right. Yeah.

336
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:17,816
All that money that you're supposed to be
making from this lawsuit of yours, huh?

337
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:20,318
Mm-hmm. Money that
you couldn't match, man.

338
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:23,321
I'll match anything you put down.
Come on, you two.

339
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:26,324
What, man? What do you want, man?
Come on with it.

340
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:28,827
- Come with it.
- Fifty bucks?

341
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:30,829
That ain't shit.
Hundred dollars.

342
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,331
Oh, a hundred dollars.
That's shit, man.

343
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:35,834
Whatever you wanna bet, man.
Just shut up.

344
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:39,838
You got it.
You got it.

345
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:42,340
Rosa, you hear that?
You're a witness.

346
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,343
- You leave me out of this.
- We got a bet.

347
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:47,846
Yeah, we got a bet.

348
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:50,348
Now you gotta prove yourself.

349
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:53,556
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure it out.

350
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:59,357
You boys better not
cause me any trouble.

351
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:02,360
Just tell him to shut up,
all right, man?

352
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,568
Does any of these people
go home around here, man?

353
00:26:09,517 --> 00:26:13,075
Rosa!

354
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:19,582
Rosa!

355
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:37,896
They said they were going to
keep the hardcover graphics.

356
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:41,103
I put in my two cents,
but I don't run the place.

357
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,607
Sexy picture of you, though.

358
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:47,906
Before the haircut?

359
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:53,115
Okay, try the keyboard.
They told me it's the softest touch.

360
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:58,120
Okay.

361
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:06,128
How does it feel?

362
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:08,426
It feels...

363
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:12,134
it feels great.

364
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:22,645
Joel!

365
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:27,650
I have to see him.
I have to go home.

366
00:27:28,096 --> 00:27:30,653
Type.

367
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,656
No!

368
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:37,660
Type.

369
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:29,007
Even though the spinal cord patient
can get a reflex erection,

370
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:32,010
it's not going to
feel the same.

371
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,218
Orgasm, as you've known it,
is very rare.

372
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:40,018
You have to
learn to experiment...

373
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,020
With your partner.

374
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,022
Communicate.

375
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:49,527
Learn what you like,
find out what they like.

376
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:51,529
Oral sex comes in handy.

377
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,532
Whoa, wait. No, there ain't
gonna be none of that.

378
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:57,535
- Did you say something, Raymond?
- Look, doc,

379
00:28:57,685 --> 00:29:02,040
I don't mean no disrespect, but a woman
was put on this earth to serve a man.

380
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,042
I just... that's just
a biological fact.

381
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:09,047
I think there are a few of us in this room,
Raymond, who might argue that point.

382
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:13,051
Doc, what you saying to me is that
you want me to eat some pussy.

383
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:16,554
Now, now, black men
don't eat pussy.

384
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:20,262
What you gonna do, Raymond,
use a straw?

385
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:25,063
Maybe I'll use your big, nappy head.
That's what I'll do.

386
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:30,568
It is your choice, Raymond, but I've
been in this chair for 18 years.

387
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:33,071
Oh, and you're saying
you go down on a woman?

388
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:35,573
Every chance I get, Raymond.

389
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:40,783
Well, that's disgusting.
That's just absolutely disgusting.

390
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,227
Dear Anna,

391
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,230
I wish I could say all that
needs to be said about us.

392
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,233
From here, just now, I cannot.

393
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,235
The halo is off, thank God.

394
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,738
For the first time since the
fall, I'm allowed the luxury...

395
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,240
Of warm, free water
to cleanse me.

396
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,743
Every third day at dawn,
I'm showered.

397
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,746
What a simple pleasure that is.

398
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,749
Such a short time ago...
it seems like forever...

399
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,251
we lay in your tiny room
in Santa Monica,

400
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:24,756
not caring as the cool night
melted into morning.

401
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,258
Now's not the time
to decide the future.

402
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,762
I'm sorry for
trying to force things.

403
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,765
Time here has stopped.
Visitors come and go.

404
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,768
Each face blending into the next.
No face yours.

405
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,270
Everyone tells me I look good.

406
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,774
I smile, make jokes.
They laugh, wish me well. They leave.

407
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:47,779
I remain here, this place.

408
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,282
They packed us into the van and took
us to a football game the other day.

409
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,284
On the way back,
we passed a strip joint,

410
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,287
and Raymond told us therein
danced his Annabelle Lee.

411
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,289
Bloss called him a liar.

412
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,293
I'm convinced that in a perfect world,
those two men would be lovers.

413
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:06,297
My wild, optimistic
imagination.

414
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:11,803
Anna, three weeks without you seems
such a long time, especially now.

415
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:15,306
But I understand.
Nothing is easy.

416
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,309
You'll be back soon.
We'll play scrabble.

417
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:23,519
We will find the words.
Love, Joel.

418
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,350
What?

419
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,353
The keys to the van.

420
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:07,358
I hope you trust my driving, 'cause tonight
I'm taking you out to eat some crow.

421
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,862
You're on, man.

422
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:16,572
Fifty-five. Is there a certain
dog in here somewhere?

423
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,372
Hey, hey, what the hell is this?
Who let this low-life element in here?

424
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,375
Hey, hey, calm yourself down!
I got family coming today.

425
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,378
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look!

426
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,881
Shut the fuck up, Raymond.
This drinking is against the rules.

427
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:34,385
Fuckin' crazy nigger, man. Thinks he's
the fuckin' mayor of the hospital, man.

428
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,889
Got some presents for you.
This one's named Lucille.

429
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,596
Gimme a kiss, Lucille.

430
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,909
You kiddin' me, man?

431
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,912
I'm gonna be motherfuckin'
rollin' in the money, man.

432
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,915
First thing I'm gonna do, I'm
gonna buy my mom a new house,

433
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:08,123
then I'm gonna get myself a motherfuckin'
harley with a lift on it, man.

434
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,424
Hey, what's the, uh, what's the deal with
the dude? You know, the money guy.

435
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,426
I don't know, man.
Let's give him a call.

436
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,134
Number's over in the top drawer.
Gimme the phone. We'll have some fun.

437
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,640
This must be it.

438
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,945
Operator.
Give me 555-9030.

439
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,947
All my lines are busy
right now. Please hold.

440
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,154
I ain't got all day
to wait on hold, motherfucker!

441
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,963
Big man's got this Asian
woman walking on his back.

442
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,465
Wait a minute.

443
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,468
Hello. Hello?
How ya doin', Mr. Raider?

444
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,971
Uh, who is this?

445
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,474
It don't matter who this is, man.
It's the fuckin' L.A. times.

446
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,476
I don't understand.
Who is this?

447
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:09,981
You care to comment on this $2.5 million
lawsuit you got going, man, huh?

448
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,484
Make you think twice before you go
runnin' over innocent people...

449
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,987
With your fuckin'
Mercedes Benz, huh, man?

450
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,194
Don't you hang up on me,
motherfucker!

451
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,198
Got him running scared, bro.

452
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,203
Don't forget who your friends
are when you're a rich man.

453
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,504
Hey, what the fuck
you lookin' at, Garcia?

454
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,713
Want a beer, bro?

455
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,516
Raymond.

456
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:49,520
Hey, Rachel. Baby, I was watching
for you to come in over there.

457
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,023
I parked on the other side.

458
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,525
Girl, you know, you look good.

459
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:59,735
Mm-mm-mm.
Boy, you look good!

460
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,533
Hey, Starletta.
How you doing, baby?

461
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,535
Look. Look what daddy's
got for you.

462
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,038
Come on.
Give your father a kiss, girl.

463
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,541
I need to sit down, Raymond.
Starletta wants a coke.

464
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:15,250
Okay. All right.
Yeah, we'll just go into the snack bar.

465
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,756
Come on, girl.

466
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:28,059
Now, Rachel, you know, baby,
I get outta here in two months.

467
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:33,769
I mean, a woman needs a man.
A child needs a father.

468
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,068
Please, Raymond.

469
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:41,072
Baby, I devote my life to you,
now you...

470
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:45,076
I mean, besides, who's gonna... who's
gonna take care of you, anyway?

471
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:50,081
Look, Raymond, I'm doin' fine.
I've always done fine.

472
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:54,585
Yeah, I know that, and I know
I've treated you bad in the past.

473
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,794
But the past is the past.
Look, I don't want to go through this again.

474
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,799
Just do this for me, okay?

475
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,304
Rachel, we are a family.

476
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,604
I'm not gonna
divorce my family.

477
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,607
You're just making this
hard on me, then.

478
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,610
Rachel, we are a family,

479
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,818
and I can't divorce my family.

480
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,618
I gotta go.
Wait. Wait.

481
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,326
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

482
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:37,628
Baby, I give you God's love,
if you just give me a chance.

483
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,336
I mean, I'm a changed man.
I ain't the way I used to be.

484
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:45,340
Come on, Starletta.

485
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,639
Rachel, you can't
walk outta here like this.

486
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,641
Tell your daddy
thank you for the coke.

487
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:55,146
- Thank you for the coke.
- You're welcome, baby.

488
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:59,150
Wait, give daddy...
Rachel! Ra-Rachel!

489
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,153
Rachel, you my wife!
You supposed to be at my side!

490
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,860
Rachel!

491
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:29,180
What time?
What time for what?

492
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,888
Annabelle Lee.

493
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,189
There ain't no Annabelle Lee.

494
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,191
We got a bet or what, man?

495
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:45,196
Forget the bet, forget the trip
and just leave me be, okay?

496
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,404
Get that cigar out of here,
Bloss. You know the rules.

497
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:07,422
There's the motherfuckers that
won't put our calls through.

498
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,225
Hey!
Hey, in there!

499
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,228
Bring your asses out here.
I wanna make a complaint!

500
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,230
Hey, goddamn it!
I know you hear me!

501
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,232
Probably sittin' on your butts
like you usually do!

502
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,235
Hey, bring your asses out here!
Raymond.

503
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,737
Goddamn...
get your hands off me!

504
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,740
Hey, don't you know you're
fuckin' with people's lives?

505
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,449
Squeaky-voice motherfuckers, maybe
I'll break your fuckin' neck!

506
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,957
Are you all right?
No, I'm not all right.

507
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:50,761
He was handing them the money,
and they shot him.

508
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:55,266
Poor kid. Right there
in his father's store.

509
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,974
Fuckin' punks, man.

510
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:04,275
Mom! Come on, cut the
fingernails, not my fingertips.

511
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,278
You're such a baby.

512
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,281
"Worms."
"Snoot."

513
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,785
That makes
9, 10, 11, 12... 16.

514
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,288
I loved your letter.

515
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,791
Well, why didn't you
write me back?

516
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,999
I can't write.
You know that.

517
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:29,004
Maybe you're afraid
of what you might say.

518
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:01,036
Anna... don't.

519
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:24,119
Is this okay?
Yeah.

520
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,437
What's your name, man?

521
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,940
My name's sang.
I'm Bloss.

522
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,943
Listen, man, if you need
anything around here,

523
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,446
you know, anything at all,
you let me know, okay?

524
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,153
I mean that.

525
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,660
You play tennis, man?

526
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,232
Gimme the juice.

527
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,549
Knock, knock.
Medication time.

528
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,257
Just a minute.
Hold on.

529
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:51,266
Okay.
Oh, Jesus.

530
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,774
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

531
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,780
Um...

532
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,081
here.

533
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,788
Thanks.

534
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:31,101
He refuses to learn
his bowel program.

535
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:35,105
Me and Rosa had to spend all last week
just trying to get him up on that toilet.

536
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,108
Cheryl Lynn says he won't even
dress himself in the morning.

537
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:43,113
Mm-hmm. It's not our problem the nigger
won't dress himself or dig his own shit.

538
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,617
When his day comes, he's outta here.
You tell him that.

539
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,619
I already did.

540
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,326
Rosa!

541
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,124
You're adorable.

542
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,126
Well, good night.

543
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,833
Good night.

544
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,635
You still like me?

545
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,342
You're okay.

546
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,159
Anna?
Do you have a minute?

547
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,366
Sure.

548
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:39,169
Um, we understand the patient's need for...
sex therapy.

549
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:43,674
But on the ward, well, the
other patients tend to feel...

550
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,676
Left out.

551
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,678
Of course.

552
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:53,183
Then, there's something about insurance,
which even I can't figure out.

553
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,686
If it were up to me,
I'd change the rules.

554
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,689
I understand your dilemma.

555
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,692
I'm sorry to embarrass you.

556
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,194
We all have our needs.

557
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:09,700
No, it's, um...
I mean, y-yes.

558
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,906
Middle button.

559
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,712
Hey!

560
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:26,216
Here we go,
back into gimp palace.

561
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:31,926
All you gimps.
You cripples!

562
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,727
Whoo, she's gonna ask me,
"can I still get it up?"

563
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,730
Shit, yeah, I can get it up.
I'm Raymond hill.

564
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,234
Got plenty of women.
Women all across the country.

565
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,737
Shoot!

566
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:51,241
Gonna ask me if I don't know
what I'm doin'. I know.

567
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,243
Matter of fact,
gonna call her right now...

568
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,951
And tell her she can come
and sit on me and this chair.

569
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,253
Hey, Rosa?

570
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:08,258
Rosa? Carmelita?
Rodriguez. Concepcion.

571
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:12,467
Why the hell you all got
so many damn names? Shh!

572
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,768
Family.

573
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:22,477
Every man...
daughter needs a father.

574
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,778
Rosa! Rosa!

575
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,280
Shit!

576
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,784
Jesus Christ, Ray!
What the hell are you trying to do, man?

577
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,287
What does it look like I'm trying to do?
Get to bed. That's what I'm trying to do.

578
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,791
It's all right, Les. It's okay.
I'll get up there myself.

579
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,795
I don't give a shit.
Goddamn only...

580
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,298
I ain't nothin' but a goddamned
statistic around here, anyway.

581
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:52,302
Les, all these people
in here is prejudice.

582
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,806
Shh! People are trying to sleep.
All of them is prejudice.

583
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,809
Where is Rosa at?
She was supposed to give me my pain...

584
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,311
you've been drinking, Ray.
I ain't been drinkin'!

585
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,313
You've been drinkin',
and you know the rules!

586
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,315
Les, I ain't... you're
supposed to be my friend.

587
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,818
I ain't gonna sit here and
let you libel my good name.

588
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,320
Get off of me.
Where's the supervisor?

589
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,323
People are trying to sleep, Ray.
Supervisor!

590
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,826
Sleepin'?
Oh, okay.

591
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:19,830
Hey, hey, halo.
Halo.

592
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,832
He can't hear you, Ray.
He's asleep.

593
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:25,335
I'm sorry I woke you up,
motherfucker.

594
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,337
I went out and got some women!

595
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,340
Come on, Ray.
Hey, Bloss, I saw Annabelle.

596
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,342
I saw Annabelle, Bloss.

597
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:35,846
Okay, okay, okay,
you just keep quiet.

598
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,850
You'll be all right.
Oh, Les!

599
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,853
It'll be all right.
Call my wife, Les.

600
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,355
That's all right.
We'll call them in the morning. No, no, no.

601
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,859
I wanna talk to Starletta.
She need a father.

602
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,861
You just need to sleep.
I need a family, Les.

603
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,364
I ain't gonna be nothin' without no family.
What am I gonna be?

604
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,868
It's gonna be all right, Ray.
You just relax.

605
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,371
G-g-get my wife
on the phone.

606
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,875
Just go to sleep. I ain't got no family.
What am I gonna do?

607
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,582
We'll call them in the morning.

608
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,906
So, they're just gonna dump this guy
on the highway with 20 bucks...

609
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,408
And a new leg bag
and say, "good luck, Raymond"?

610
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,411
Yep. I'd, uh,
I'd feel sorry for him,

611
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,914
but I'm saving up
all my pity for myself.

612
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,916
You haven't used any yet?
That much.

613
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,918
Sorry I took so long.
At last.

614
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,920
You two have fun today.
Thanks.

615
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,627
So long, saps!

616
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,930
I bought you this tape,
didn't I?

617
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,934
Our third date.
I already had the cd, by the way.

618
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,936
I never told you that.

619
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,439
Obviously, I was not
thinking too clearly.

620
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,442
Half a year of those looks
every time I went in the office.

621
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,445
- I never gave you looks.
- Oh, now, you gave me looks.

622
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,948
You gavemelooks.
You gave me looks.

623
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,950
Oops! Oops!

624
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,953
A wind! It blew out of my hand.
You fucker!

625
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,957
I'm sorry. I'll buy you another one.
I hate you.

626
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,460
Ah, good choice.

627
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,462
Yeah.
Romantic.

628
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,965
Now, you were heading?

629
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,467
Uh, I was heading
this way, east.

630
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:42,472
And, um, he was coming up
brower, heading north.

631
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:44,474
And?

632
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,477
I went through
the intersection.

633
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,184
Roughly how fast
were you going?

634
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,483
Mr. Dorsinski?
What?

635
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,987
About how fast were you going?

636
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,990
I don't know.
About 30, 35.

637
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,993
You all right, Bloss?
I'm fine, mom.

638
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,996
So, he crossed through and hit you
in the middle of the intersection.

639
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,998
That's what I said, didn't I?

640
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:11,001
Look, can we talk about this
in a restaurant?

641
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,208
I gotta find a bathroom.

642
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,518
What?
I want to look at you.

643
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,520
Joel, I'm shy.

644
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,228
Let me. Please.

645
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,783
What's wrong?

646
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,081
Mm, it's wet.

647
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:35,085
Oh, shit!
The gizmo slipped.

648
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,087
It's okay. It's okay.
Damn it! Son of...

649
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,089
it's not okay!
It's fucked!

650
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,796
We have another one.
We'll just clean it up, okay?

651
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,812
It's only a little wet.
It's no big deal, okay? I got it.

652
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,111
Hey, it's okay.

653
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:03,613
I might go again.
I never know when I'm gonna go.

654
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,616
We'll put on your other gizmo.
It's not worth it.

655
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,119
Just forget it. Fuck it.
Hey, come on.

656
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:13,828
I don't feel anything, anyway.
Can we just... just forget it, all right?

657
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,639
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

658
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:33,143
Isn't she beautiful?

659
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,146
Oh, she looks
just like you, Victor.

660
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,149
Oh. Uh-oh.
Let's go to daddy.

661
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,651
Let's go to daddy.
Watch the neck.

662
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,654
Vengase, mi hijita.
Travelin' baby.

663
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,656
Ah!

664
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:51,661
Mom, if he's a lawyer, he should
be able to answer our questions.

665
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,165
Probably has to talk
to Mr. sparks first.

666
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,668
Who's Mr. sparks?
You know, the guy on tv.

667
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,375
Larry sparks.

668
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,677
Mom, you're telling me that you
got these bozos off the tv?

669
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,679
Yeah.

670
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,682
Mom, that's just plain stupid.

671
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,185
No, it's not.
This is the respectable firm.

672
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,188
It's stupid, mom!

673
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,691
Bloss, you know,
I think you're upset,

674
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,693
and I think it's because
you went back too soon.

675
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,696
I told you it was too soon.
Don't get on my case about it.

676
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:29,699
Leave me alone about it and
don't make it my fault, okay?

677
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,202
Howdy, partner!

678
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,205
Who the fuck is that?

679
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,912
Hope you're all ready
for a little entertainment.

680
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:19,954
Fucking square dancers
in my room!

681
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,253
Bloss. Bloss!

682
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,256
Bloss, these people
are trying to cheer you up,

683
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,964
and you are being so rude!

684
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,783
Bloss!

685
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:57,992
Bloss. Bloss!

686
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,305
Hey, man.

687
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,808
You all right?

688
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:23,517
Just go away.
Leave me alone.

689
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:35,529
Boy, you do know how
to trash a place.

690
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,536
Here, have a taste.

691
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:46,836
Look, it's unhealthy
to drink alone.

692
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:51,341
It's better to drink with a partner,
even if it has to be you.

693
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,844
Fuck you, man. Now look at that.
Why you gonna wipe it off?

694
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,847
That is just so childish.
You know, my sister used to do that.

695
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,849
Probably good reason, man.

696
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,556
It's childish!

697
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,858
Ah, yes.

698
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,565
What the fuck is this shit?

699
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,367
Here, give it here.

700
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:21,371
Yeah, go ahead. Have another one.
Don't mind me.

701
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:26,376
You know, Bloss,
I've been thinkin'.

702
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,378
If a man wanna snuff it, bam!

703
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,881
Aim his chair
into traffic, squish!

704
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,884
Huh? But you got to
time it right.

705
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,092
You got to pick the right car.

706
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,890
Like a Cadillac.

707
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,892
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no, no, a bus.

708
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,100
Now a bus will
squoosh you real good.

709
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,603
So, do it, man.

710
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:56,406
Oh, shit! If I was one of
them total quads, then...

711
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,409
man, they can't even
raise their hands.

712
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,912
You know, they can't
even slug a man.

713
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:07,121
I mean, goddamn, even a quad
need to slug a man sometime.

714
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:17,927
Look at Joe, man.
I hate that motherfucker.

715
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,930
I say you just jealous,
that's all.

716
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,933
You just jealous
because he got a woman,

717
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,936
and he know his place.

718
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,644
Every man got to find
his place, Bloss.

719
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,700
When are we going out again?

720
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,702
I'll have to check my calendar.

721
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:46,706
Come on, Joel.
I had a good time, really.

722
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:52,917
We saw a movie.
We saw a bad, bad, bad movie.

723
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,718
We had dinner.
Dinner was okay.

724
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:03,427
All right. All right.
The whole day was fucked.

725
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,228
I'm just gonna go inside, okay?
I'll be all right.

726
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:12,232
You sure?
Yeah.

727
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,735
Okay.
Good night.

728
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,942
Good night.

729
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,446
I love you.

730
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,267
Howdy, partner.

731
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:51,475
Missed you at the hoedown.
Next time, huh?

732
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,774
So long.

733
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,982
Bye.

734
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:46,030
Vernon's wife.

735
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,333
Give up? No, fuck that.
Give up. Fuck you, man.

736
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,835
Kick your ass, man.

737
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,338
So when you gonna
pay up that bet, man?

738
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,340
Ain't that some shit?

739
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:05,345
Mr. lawsuit here
worryin' his ass about $100.

740
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,847
Will you stop?

741
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,849
Well, it's the principle, man.

742
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,353
Don't worry about it. She's dead.
You can guarantee it.

743
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:17,561
One hand, motherfucker.
One hand, my man.

744
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:26,570
We dumped.

745
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,370
We fucked up, man.

746
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,079
Oh, lord. I sure hope
somebody comes along.

747
01:01:47,487 --> 01:01:51,341
Hey, Bloss. Did I tell you
about my dream, man?

748
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:55,345
No, man. You don't tell
me about your dreams.

749
01:01:55,495 --> 01:01:58,848
It'll freak you out.

750
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:03,853
I'm on this lake
and I'm standing up.

751
01:02:04,003 --> 01:02:09,563
No chair, man. The sky,
a beautiful blue all around me.

752
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:14,568
And I'm standing on the water.

753
01:02:16,015 --> 01:02:18,868
But I'm dancing, see.

754
01:02:19,018 --> 01:02:23,373
That's the only way I can
stay up is to do this dance.

755
01:02:23,523 --> 01:02:26,376
And I know that as soon...

756
01:02:26,526 --> 01:02:29,879
as soon as I quit...
Forget it, that's it.

757
01:02:30,029 --> 01:02:31,881
I'm going down.

758
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:35,385
I can't swim.

759
01:02:35,535 --> 01:02:38,388
No land for miles around.

760
01:02:38,538 --> 01:02:41,891
So I keep doing this dance.

761
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:43,893
And I get tired.

762
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:48,898
I keep doing this dance,
tired of doing that dance.

763
01:02:49,048 --> 01:02:54,608
I get tired, so tired.

764
01:02:56,556 --> 01:02:59,113
And then I wake up.

765
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,618
Oh, man.
It freaked me out.

766
01:03:17,076 --> 01:03:20,634
Hel...

767
01:03:29,589 --> 01:03:32,646
help!

768
01:03:56,616 --> 01:04:01,175
I stitched it up for you. It's like new.
It was pretty messed up.

769
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,478
Listen, I want you
to tell me something, man.

770
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:11,481
And don't be stupid about it.

771
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:14,484
I want you to tell me what happened
on the day that I dumped, man.

772
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:18,488
What happened? The guy ran the light.
He fucked you up.

773
01:04:18,638 --> 01:04:21,491
What really happened, man?

774
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:25,495
I want you to tell me what really happened.
I don't remember.

775
01:04:25,645 --> 01:04:29,999
Look, we were racin', man.
We were just toolin' around.

776
01:04:30,149 --> 01:04:33,707
We were pretty blasted,
but that don't make you blind.

777
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:38,508
Don't think about it, man.

778
01:04:38,658 --> 01:04:41,215
Here.

779
01:05:45,725 --> 01:05:48,578
No, I'm...
look, go to dinner, please.

780
01:05:48,728 --> 01:05:51,080
I'm not gonna...
no, I'm fine about it.

781
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:54,083
I'll get Florence to do it,
all right? It's her job.

782
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:57,086
She gets paid for it.

783
01:05:57,236 --> 01:06:01,591
If it's gonna make you happy,
please, by all means, do it.

784
01:06:01,741 --> 01:06:05,094
I'm... I-I... hey, I gotta go.

785
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:07,597
If you wanna come,
just come, all right?

786
01:06:07,747 --> 01:06:10,600
Bye-bye.

787
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:15,605
Hey, uh, got in a fight with your
girlfriend, man, it ain't no big thing.

788
01:06:15,755 --> 01:06:19,108
Leave me alone, Bloss.

789
01:06:19,258 --> 01:06:22,816
Just tryin' to be friendly.

790
01:06:25,264 --> 01:06:28,618
- What? - I said I'm just
tryin' to be friendly.

791
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:32,121
Oh, well.
Do me a favor, huh?

792
01:06:32,271 --> 01:06:35,829
Just leave me the fuck alone.

793
01:06:38,778 --> 01:06:41,631
Now you're showing
some spirit, Joe.

794
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:44,133
You know what
your problem is, man?

795
01:06:44,283 --> 01:06:48,638
You know what your problem is?
You're determined to pick a fight, huh?

796
01:06:48,788 --> 01:06:51,140
Your problem is that
you ain't got no problem, man.

797
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:53,142
Look at you, man.

798
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:56,145
You call yourself Garcia.
You ain't no Mexican.

799
01:06:56,295 --> 01:06:59,148
You ain't no nigger.
You certainly ain't no white dude.

800
01:06:59,298 --> 01:07:04,153
You're just better than everybody else.
You and your fucking glasses, man.

801
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:07,156
I got news for you, pal.

802
01:07:07,306 --> 01:07:10,159
How long you think it's gonna take before
that pretty little girl of yours...

803
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:13,162
Leaves you for somebody who can
tune her engine, my man?

804
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:15,869
Are you done?

805
01:07:18,317 --> 01:07:22,171
No.

806
01:07:22,321 --> 01:07:24,878
No, I ain't.

807
01:08:04,864 --> 01:08:07,717
They're pretty good.

808
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:13,222
I think they'd be better
if they'd stop, but, uh...

809
01:08:13,372 --> 01:08:17,226
oh, come on, please.
Will you move sometime tonight?

810
01:08:17,376 --> 01:08:21,230
- Hey, Rosa, can you give me a darvadol?
-Oh, how about Percocet?

811
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:24,734
Oh. No, no, no. How about demoran?
That's even better.

812
01:08:24,884 --> 01:08:26,736
Hey, Rosa, can you swing that?

813
01:08:26,886 --> 01:08:29,238
Morphine, you could shoot
him up with some morphine.

814
01:08:29,388 --> 01:08:31,741
Bloss can get me some heroin.
That'd be wild, wouldn't it?

815
01:08:31,891 --> 01:08:36,746
- Hey, Rosa, ask Bloss if he can score me
some smack, huh? - I'll get you a darvadol.

816
01:08:36,896 --> 01:08:40,249
Well, hurry up, huh?
You're an asshole, you know that?

817
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,251
You're a hemorrhoid
on an asshole.

818
01:08:42,401 --> 01:08:45,755
You're an inflamed hemorrhoid
on a donkey's asshole.

819
01:08:45,905 --> 01:08:48,462
Well, you're a cunt.

820
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:51,761
Why do I even come here?

821
01:08:51,911 --> 01:08:54,263
What makes you say that?
You just called me a cunt.

822
01:08:54,413 --> 01:08:58,972
Well, when you imply that I'm a drug addict.
It was a joke, come on.

823
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,273
- What is your problem?
- I broke my fucking neck!

824
01:09:04,423 --> 01:09:06,275
- I know.
- You don't know.

825
01:09:06,425 --> 01:09:10,780
If any walking person knows, Joel,
it's me, all right? Don't give me that shit.

826
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:13,783
I know. I think about it
for two hours on the freeway.

827
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:15,785
I think about it while
I'm washing your clothes.

828
01:09:15,935 --> 01:09:18,788
I think about it while I'm looking
for accessible apartments.

829
01:09:18,938 --> 01:09:21,290
I'm sorry, all right?
My heart really bleeds for you.

830
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,292
Fuck this.
Where's your laundry?

831
01:09:23,442 --> 01:09:26,295
I said you didn't have to do my laundry.
I live for your laundry.

832
01:09:26,445 --> 01:09:30,299
I live to come here and argue scrabble
rules with you, really. It makes me whole.

833
01:09:30,449 --> 01:09:33,302
I love how your face brightens
up when I walk in a room.

834
01:09:33,452 --> 01:09:38,808
I lost something too, you know.
You may not understand that, but it's true.

835
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:42,015
You're out of shampoo.

836
01:09:45,464 --> 01:09:48,021
I love you.

837
01:09:53,973 --> 01:09:56,530
Enjoy the show?

838
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:35,865
If it isn't Garcia, man.

839
01:10:36,015 --> 01:10:39,869
Senorgarcia to you.

840
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:41,871
Hey, did you and Raymond
ever settle that bet?

841
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:45,875
- What do you care, man?
- Maybe I want some of the action.

842
01:10:46,025 --> 01:10:47,877
Too late, Joe.

843
01:10:48,027 --> 01:10:52,085
Hey, Joel, you wanna play?
Yeah, come on out and be a gimp, Joe.

844
01:10:53,532 --> 01:10:56,590
I hate badminton.

845
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:53,647
Rosa!

846
01:11:57,096 --> 01:11:59,653
Rosa!

847
01:12:03,602 --> 01:12:06,660
Rosa!

848
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:24,473
Hey, Vernon.

849
01:12:24,623 --> 01:12:29,478
- Rosa?
- No. My name is Joel.

850
01:12:29,628 --> 01:12:33,482
Would you fix the tv, please?

851
01:12:33,632 --> 01:12:36,189
Sure.

852
01:12:52,651 --> 01:12:56,710
How's that?

853
01:13:09,668 --> 01:13:15,228
I saw your wife.
She's very beautiful, beautiful.

854
01:13:20,179 --> 01:13:23,032
It's hard, isn't it, vern?

855
01:13:23,182 --> 01:13:25,739
Do you love her?

856
01:13:32,191 --> 01:13:34,043
My girlfriend,

857
01:13:34,193 --> 01:13:37,046
she touches me now...

858
01:13:37,196 --> 01:13:40,549
And I don't feel a thing.

859
01:13:40,699 --> 01:13:46,055
I feel like nothing,
like piss and shit.

860
01:13:46,205 --> 01:13:50,059
Like the smell
of this place, it's...

861
01:13:50,209 --> 01:13:55,268
and I-I can't be nice to her.

862
01:13:56,715 --> 01:13:59,068
Sometimes, I hate her.

863
01:13:59,218 --> 01:14:04,573
I feel this anger coming up
inside me, and I lash out at her,

864
01:14:04,723 --> 01:14:07,280
but I don't mean to.

865
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:13,582
I don't know.

866
01:14:13,732 --> 01:14:16,790
She's so good to me, you know.

867
01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:25,799
I hate her for walking...

868
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:29,803
For feeling.

869
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:37,811
If we live together
when I get out...

870
01:14:39,258 --> 01:14:44,613
oh, God, I can just see
the pity in people's eyes...

871
01:14:44,763 --> 01:14:47,616
Falling over
themselves to help me...

872
01:14:47,766 --> 01:14:53,122
Or pretending not to see me or pretending
that nothing happened to me...

873
01:14:53,272 --> 01:14:56,830
When it did.

874
01:14:57,776 --> 01:15:00,333
It did.

875
01:15:09,288 --> 01:15:12,846
I fell, vern.

876
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:22,355
I can't walk.

877
01:15:29,808 --> 01:15:33,366
Oh, God. Damn.

878
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,343
I'm sorry, baby.

879
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,357
Oh, God.

880
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,867
I'm sorry, vern.

881
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,372
Vern?

882
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:23,679
What do you mean
an old folks' home?

883
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,181
A place where
they keep old people.

884
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:29,184
He didn't have
anywhere else to go.

885
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,186
It's no piece of news to me.

886
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:33,188
What about his wife?

887
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:37,693
I just suppose
it didn't work out.

888
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:43,403
- What, Bloss, you suddenly concerned
about Raymond? - He owes me money.

889
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,408
Where is this place?

890
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:59,715
What?

891
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,217
I took the keys
to the hospital van, Joe.

892
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:05,220
What do you say we go on a little
field trip and settle this bet?

893
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:09,725
You've got room in your life for
a little adventure, don't you?

894
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:14,730
You drive.
Why don't you drive?

895
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,733
I don't have a license.

896
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,236
I'll watch the door
while you get dressed.

897
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:23,443
I need you, Joe.

898
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:31,246
Bloss, what you doing?

899
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:33,248
I'm gonna go see
some naked ladies, man.

900
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,250
Live naked ladies?

901
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,958
You think I'm gonna go see
some dead naked ladies?

902
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,759
What are you doin', man?

903
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,762
Forget about it, man.
You ain't going, all right?

904
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,765
I'd have to dress you, I gotta
put you in your wheelchair, man.

905
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,268
Forget about it.
Besides, your mother would kill me, man.

906
01:17:53,418 --> 01:17:56,976
You ain't goin'.

907
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,987
Hey, this is fun.

908
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,291
Have you got
your headlights on, man?

909
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:21,501
Oh, yeah.
Shit.

910
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:26,802
- Turn left up ahead here.
- I thought the strip joint was on devaulle.

911
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,008
Look out, man!

912
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,810
Boy, that guy sure
came out of nowhere.

913
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,018
Good thing we're
already paralyzed.

914
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:45,525
Yeah.

915
01:19:00,485 --> 01:19:04,043
Don't go anywhere.

916
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:14,850
Raymond, Raymond hill,

917
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,058
this is the ghost of all
your past white pussy.

918
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,861
Bloss. Oh, shit.

919
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:29,364
Oh, man.
What time is it?

920
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:31,867
A man's gotta get his sleep.

921
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:36,576
Not tonight, man. Tonight I'm
taking you out to eat some crow.

922
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,375
Wait.
What-what are you doing?

923
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:43,879
Get dressed, man.
What are you doing?

924
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,882
We're gonna go see
Annabelle Lee.

925
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,385
Bloss, there ain't no Annabelle Lee.
Bullshit, man.

926
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:54,890
There ain't. I was lying.
Yeah? Tell you what, man.

927
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,394
I'll bet you the same $100 that you
ain't lying, man. Where's your socks?

928
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:01,396
Get dressed, man.
Damn it, Bloss.

929
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,899
You can't come into a man's room
in the middle of the night...

930
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,401
And expect him to get up out of bed.
Shut up, man.

931
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:10,405
Forget the bet. We'll go out. We'll get drunk.
We'll go get some pussy, man.

932
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:13,408
What, is this place so fucking good, man?
Get dressed.

933
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:17,412
Don't nobody control my life. This is my life.
I do with it what I wanna do.

934
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:20,415
I'm gonna call the nurse...

935
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:24,624
If you don't get out of here.

936
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,639
Hey, is he coming?

937
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,938
Oh, man.
It must be the wrong place.

938
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:47,146
Look. We're out, man.
We might as well party.

939
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:52,652
Okay.

940
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:07,963
Ten bucks, big guy.
Ten bucks?

941
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:11,466
Yo, I need 30 bucks, man.
Thirty bucks?

942
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:13,969
Jeez.
Give me some money for a tip.

943
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,972
How do you like that, sang?

944
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,474
Here you go, bro.
Coke or juice?

945
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,977
Juice. Forget the juice.
Three cokes.

946
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:24,684
Seats by the stage over there.

947
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,982
Hey, look who's here, man.

948
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:30,690
Who is that?
Check him out, man.

949
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:34,489
Hey, Les.
Les, buddy.

950
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,491
Les, my man.

951
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:39,494
Lester.

952
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:43,498
- What the hell are you guys doing here?
- Little night pass, man.

953
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:46,001
Hey, Les, does your wife
know you're here, man?

954
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:48,708
Does she know you come
to places like this, bro?

955
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:53,008
Nine dollars, gentlemen.
Yo.

956
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,011
You took my money.
I'm-I'm broke.

957
01:21:56,161 --> 01:22:00,015
Nine dollars, gentlemen. My main man Lester
over here is gonna pay for it, honey.

958
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:03,222
Thanks, Les.

959
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:10,730
Tip me a dollar.

960
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:15,030
You really are a charmer, Les.

961
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,737
You really are.

962
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:11,086
How'd you like that, Joel?
Pretty good.

963
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,588
Pretty good, man?
She was serving you up hair pie, dude.

964
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:16,091
What you want, cool whip on it?

965
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,093
Give her a hand
and hand her some green.

966
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:21,096
That luscious lady's
name is Stephanie.

967
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:25,100
All right. Peking's a city
in China but tipping's not.

968
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,103
Show a little appreciation
for this lovely creation...

969
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:30,105
Yeah, baby.
Named Stephanie.

970
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,607
Thank you. They're bound to
notice you guys gone by now.

971
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:34,609
Maybe you ought to
be getting back.

972
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:37,112
Hey, man. We came here
for a reason, all right?

973
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:42,617
So why don't you just chill
out on all the bullshit?

974
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:45,620
You know, if we were
a zola novel right now,

975
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:48,623
we would be just
symbols of society's decay.

976
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:50,625
That's so fucking obvious.

977
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:56,131
But if we were a flannery o'Connor
short story, you know what?

978
01:23:56,281 --> 01:24:01,636
There is no telling which one of us might
find redemption in a place like this.

979
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,638
It's true.
Redemption.

980
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:06,641
You guys ready for a little
more sweet entertainment?

981
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:09,348
Let's hear it now.

982
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:15,650
Okay, Tarzan, just take it easy.
We got your Jane comin' out right now.

983
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:22,361
Here she comes, the fabulous Annabelle Lee.
Annabelle Lee.

984
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:34,169
Give me some cash.
Why don't you bring your own money?

985
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,171
Give me some cash.
Do I look like a bank?

986
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,878
Don't be tight, man.

987
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,683
When troubles weigh me down

988
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:53,893
there's a place I can go

989
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,693
you know a guy
named Raymond hill?

990
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:00,695
A black dude?

991
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:03,698
A lady's man, missing a finger?

992
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:05,700
What, is he a friend of yours?

993
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,407
Yeah, you could say that.

994
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,208
How's Raymond doing?

995
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:18,417
He's good. You ever
spend time with him?

996
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:22,717
Spend time?

997
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:25,424
He tell you I did?

998
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:30,429
Let's just say
something slipped out.

999
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:34,433
You tell Raymond I said hi.

1000
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:41,736
So Raymond won the bet?

1001
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:46,445
Yeah, I guess.

1002
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:55,750
It was sad, really.

1003
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:00,755
I mean, all those young,
beautiful, attractive women...

1004
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:03,758
Bouncing around with their
perfect breasts in the air.

1005
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:05,760
Sounds sad.
You know they shave around their...

1006
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:08,763
all right. Thank you.
You can spare the details.

1007
01:26:08,913 --> 01:26:10,765
I don't know.
It makes you...

1008
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:13,768
it makes you wonder what's wrong with them,
you know? What happened to their lives?

1009
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:16,976
Have to pay their rent.
Hmm.

1010
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:26,281
I get out in two weeks.

1011
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,489
I think I found an apartment
that's accessible.

1012
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:35,790
Thank you. Thanks.

1013
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,294
You don't have to thank me.
No, I do.

1014
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:42,797
I want to thank you
for that. Thank you.

1015
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:45,504
Have I thanked you enough?

1016
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:48,303
Is something on your mind?

1017
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:52,011
Why? Is something
on yours?

1018
01:26:55,460 --> 01:27:00,019
I left David.
I told him.

1019
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:07,322
What?
I told him about us.

1020
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,825
You, uh...

1021
01:27:10,975 --> 01:27:13,532
what?
What's so funny?

1022
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,333
How did he respond?
What-what did he say?

1023
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,835
He knew.
Yeah.

1024
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:22,837
Of course he knew.
He's known for months.

1025
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:28,343
So, he's accepted it
in a graceful way?

1026
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:33,052
Well, he put the phone
through the living room window.

1027
01:27:33,998 --> 01:27:37,056
He got eight stitches.

1028
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:43,562
Stay with him.

1029
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:48,067
What?

1030
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:51,570
Stay with him.

1031
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:57,576
What? What are you
thinking? What?

1032
01:27:58,022 --> 01:28:00,875
What, you just decide
this for both of us?

1033
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:05,380
Well, no.
I decided it for myself.

1034
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:08,383
When? You figured this out
in the strip joint?

1035
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:11,590
I figured it out.

1036
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,593
Oh, I see.

1037
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:20,895
I don't know what to say.

1038
01:28:21,045 --> 01:28:24,899
Tell me that I'm wrong.
Fight me about this.

1039
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:28,403
Tell me that I'm absolutely,
100 percent wrong.

1040
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:33,112
You are. You're wrong.

1041
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,912
That's it?
That's all you've got to say?

1042
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:43,622
You just hit me with this.
You can't expect me to have an argument.

1043
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:52,631
Stay with him.
He's your husband.

1044
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:04,143
Stay with him.
He'll understand.

1045
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,960
I-I love you.

1046
01:29:26,110 --> 01:29:29,668
I love you too.

1047
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,672
Come here, baby.

1048
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:45,980
We'll go to bad movies.
You'll still be in my life.

1049
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:49,688
You'll still be...
I'm sorry.

1050
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,193
Oh, baby.

1051
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:38,533
You can't use Korean words.

1052
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:43,538
This is not Korean.
What, "bozo"? You're a bozo.

1053
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:47,041
This is a Korean word.
You can't use this.

1054
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:51,045
You can't use Korean.
You can't use vietnamese.

1055
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:54,048
You can't use Chinese.
You can't use Mexican.

1056
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:57,051
You gotta use
fuckin' English words.

1057
01:30:57,201 --> 01:31:00,054
Yeah, hello. Hey, Bloss.
Bloss, old buddy, how you doing?

1058
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:03,057
What? Who is this?
Raymond, man, Raymond.

1059
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:05,059
Oh, man,
it's motherfucking cold.

1060
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:09,063
It's Joel, hold on.
Hey, Bloss, it's for you.

1061
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:12,066
He didn't wanna put
his words on, you notice?

1062
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:17,276
Don't be lookin' at my letters. You got some
more three-point wonders waitin' over here?

1063
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:20,074
He sounds drunk.

1064
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:23,077
What do you want, Raymond?
Hey, Bloss, how you doin', man?

1065
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:27,081
I'm doing good man. I'm hangin' out playing
scrabble with my mother and sang, man.

1066
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:30,585
Oh, yeah, sang. I'll bet
he's kickin' your big butt.

1067
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:34,589
You okay, Raymond? I'm great.
I broke out of that old people's place.

1068
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:37,592
- What are you talking about?
- I found it. It's perfect.

1069
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:41,596
I-I ain't seen
no Cadillacs come by.

1070
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,098
But the bus come by
every 20 minutes.

1071
01:31:44,248 --> 01:31:47,602
Aw, shit. There goes one now.
Listen to me, man.

1072
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:51,606
Don't do anything stupid, okay?
I'm just waitin' for the bus, Bloss.

1073
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:54,108
Tell me where you are, man.
I'm just waitin' for the bus.

1074
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:57,111
Ray, tell me where you are.
I don't know. Some street, man.

1075
01:31:57,261 --> 01:32:01,616
What fuckin' street, man? Look up at the
street sign and you tell me where you are.

1076
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:05,324
Ready to put you through.
Motherfucker, man!

1077
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:14,629
You didn't have to
hang up on me.

1078
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,336
Aw, fuck it then.

1079
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:32,647
I heard him.
He was dead serious, okay?

1080
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:35,149
You gotta tell the police.
They gotta put out an a.P.B. On him.

1081
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:38,653
Look, Bloss, we already called the convalescent
hospital. We have called the police, man.

1082
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:42,657
Why don't we just go out and look
for him together, man, you and me?

1083
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:46,661
Be serious, man. Look, everything
that can be done is being done, okay?

1084
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:49,163
Bullshit, man!
The fucking phone people, man.

1085
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:52,166
Fuckin' phone people. I feel
like killing somebody, man.

1086
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:55,670
Look, Bloss. You know Ray.
You know that he talks, man.

1087
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:59,878
I heard him.
I'm telling you, he was serious.

1088
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,194
Look, I told you the police
are already on their way, okay?

1089
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:23,197
So why don't you just
go outside and meet them?

1090
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:26,405
Heck of a help, man.

1091
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:42,717
Hey! Hey, come on out
here, you slimy fucks!

1092
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:47,221
I know you're in there,
you squeaky-voiced motherfucker.

1093
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:49,724
Shit.

1094
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:53,728
Come on out here,
you little scum-sucking prick!

1095
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:58,937
Fuck.

1096
01:34:30,414 --> 01:34:32,266
Let's kick some ass,
college boy.

1097
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:34,973
Hold, please.

1098
01:34:38,422 --> 01:34:40,979
Darn it, will you quit?

1099
01:34:45,429 --> 01:34:49,488
How did you get in here?

1100
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:53,788
What are you doing?
I'm gonna kill you.

1101
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:56,791
Why don't we talk?
Every day we try to talk.

1102
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:59,293
A guy's about to kill
himself and you cut him off.

1103
01:34:59,443 --> 01:35:01,295
I don't wanna hurt you.
Oh, hurt me, asshole. Go ahead!

1104
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:05,504
You ain't gonna hurt anybody, motherfucker.
Oh, this is ridiculous.

1105
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:08,803
You're choking me.
Kick him, Bloss.

1106
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:12,306
- How the hell am I gonna kick him, man?
- What do you want from me?

1107
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:16,310
Apologize. Okay, I'm sorry.
Sheila, get security.

1108
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:19,814
- I said I'm sorry.
- For what?

1109
01:35:19,964 --> 01:35:25,820
For putting you on hold. Look, I got
a wife and kids. You're choking me.

1110
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,822
Yeah, we've got lives too, asshole.
Tell him, Joe.

1111
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:30,324
We got lives. We're not just noise.
I never called you noise.

1112
01:35:30,474 --> 01:35:33,327
We're in wheelchairs stuck
in a fucking hospital ward.

1113
01:35:33,477 --> 01:35:36,831
I'm sorry for that.
And I'm sorry for making your life harder.

1114
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:42,541
You're killing me.
Fuck off.

1115
01:35:57,001 --> 01:36:00,058
You really ought to channel
those hostilities there, Joe.

1116
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,861
Don't think I'm not
gonna press charges, buddy.

1117
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:10,865
I don't care who the hell you are or what
your problem is. I've got a family. And you...

1118
01:36:11,015 --> 01:36:15,369
you better pray that Raymond hill
is still alive, motherfucker.

1119
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:19,373
You want me to press charges?

1120
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:21,375
They assaulted me, didn't they?

1121
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:23,878
What if they just
said they were sorry?

1122
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:28,086
Sheila, tell them. The guy comes in
and grabs me around the throat...

1123
01:36:29,533 --> 01:36:31,886
they found Raymond.

1124
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:36,094
He was asleep in his chair
over on Finch and Holden.

1125
01:37:03,567 --> 01:37:05,419
What about these?

1126
01:37:05,569 --> 01:37:08,923
Toss it, mom. They've
been in there five months.

1127
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:12,426
Oh, no need to waste them.

1128
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:16,430
Bloss? Raymond's upstairs.
Thought you might wanna know.

1129
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:22,641
- How is he?
- I haven't talked to him.

1130
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:37,155
- Got time for a visitor?
- Hey, come on in.

1131
01:37:38,602 --> 01:37:40,454
Rosa said you were here.

1132
01:37:40,604 --> 01:37:43,457
Yeah.

1133
01:37:43,607 --> 01:37:45,960
They cut me up tomorrow.

1134
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,963
Gonna sew some of my stomach
onto my bladder.

1135
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,670
You know a man's
gotta have a big bladder.

1136
01:37:55,619 --> 01:37:57,471
I got something for you.

1137
01:37:57,621 --> 01:37:59,974
What's this?

1138
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:04,478
You won the bet, man.
I talked to Annabelle Lee.

1139
01:38:04,628 --> 01:38:08,482
You talked to her...
About me?

1140
01:38:08,632 --> 01:38:11,485
Mm-hmm.
She remembered you.

1141
01:38:11,635 --> 01:38:14,989
Well, of course she did.

1142
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:20,995
Shoot. How a woman gonna forget Raymond
hill, God's gift to the female species?

1143
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:23,497
Yeah, that was
her words exactly.

1144
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:28,002
I can't take your money.
No, man. A bet's a bet.

1145
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:30,004
No, I can't take it.
No.

1146
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:35,714
Okay, if you insist.
I mean, a bet is a bet.

1147
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:41,720
Where's the other 40?
I gotta get back to you with that.

1148
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:49,023
You still livin' in that home?

1149
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:52,526
Yeah.

1150
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:56,030
I ran away a couple of times.

1151
01:38:56,180 --> 01:39:00,034
Didn't I call you once?
Yeah. Don't you remember?

1152
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:05,039
Oh, man. Things get a little
crazy every now and then.

1153
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:07,541
But it ain't so bad.

1154
01:39:07,691 --> 01:39:13,251
They got this cute little nurse there.
She got a thing for me.

1155
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:17,756
It ain't so bad.

1156
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:23,261
Yeah. I gotta go, man.

1157
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:27,265
You take care
of yourself, Raymond.

1158
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:30,769
Nobody else to do it.

1159
01:39:42,726 --> 01:39:45,579
You know,

1160
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:48,082
maybe one of these days
you're feeling better,

1161
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:53,291
you and me, we'll go out and
see Annabelle Lee together, man.

1162
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:01,095
Not much stuff after six months.
It's better that way, don't you think?

1163
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:04,598
Rosa, let me help you with that.
No, I'm fine.

1164
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:06,600
Oh, now she's superwoman.

1165
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,103
Les, this is for you.
I forgot to give it to you.

1166
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:13,607
Oh, thanks, Joel.
Uh, I already have one of these, man.

1167
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:16,110
I mean, I haven't
read it yet, but...

1168
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,112
well, this is inscribed.
It's a gift.

1169
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:20,114
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.

1170
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:22,116
Les!

1171
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:26,120
You take care of yourself.
Bye-bye.

1172
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:28,122
Les!

1173
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:31,125
How are you and Anna?

1174
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,627
Well, we're still friends.

1175
01:40:33,777 --> 01:40:36,130
Lots of fishes.

1176
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:39,133
You know, Joel.
If I wasn't married...

1177
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:41,635
Oh, yeah.
I bet you say that to all the boys.

1178
01:40:41,785 --> 01:40:45,844
Well, yeah.
But don't think I never mean it.

1179
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,642
Hey, get your
hands out of there.

1180
01:40:48,792 --> 01:40:51,850
Bye-bye.
Bye.

1181
01:41:03,807 --> 01:41:09,367
Hey, scrappy Joe, my man.
I'm off, buddy. Me too.

1182
01:41:10,814 --> 01:41:12,666
Well.

1183
01:41:12,816 --> 01:41:15,373
Hey, uh...

1184
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:19,673
You take these, man.

1185
01:41:19,823 --> 01:41:22,176
Oh, gee, thanks.

1186
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:26,680
Now, you do know that
my name is Joel, don't you?

1187
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:29,183
Joel.

1188
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:31,890
Yeah.

1189
01:41:32,836 --> 01:41:34,893
Adios.

1190
01:41:43,847 --> 01:41:45,699
Hi, pat.

1191
01:41:45,849 --> 01:41:49,908
Hi... Anna.

1192
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,709
This is all your stuff?
Yeah, that's it.

1193
01:41:55,859 --> 01:41:59,718
Say all your good-byes?
Too many.

1194
01:41:59,863 --> 01:42:02,421
Let's go.
