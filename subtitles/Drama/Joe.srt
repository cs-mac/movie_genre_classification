0
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,097
You didn't go to Boston.

1
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,361
No.

2
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,859
I tell that prick I'm gonna have $1,000...

3
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,802
...I'm gonna have a thou.

4
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,330
-I'm still $50 short.
-What has that got to do with anything?

5
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,001
Everything.

6
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,144
Business is business.

7
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,377
You gotta keep your word.

8
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,050
Your word is your reputation.

9
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,547
You lose your reputation,
and you're out of business.

10
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,058
You're not talking about business,
you're talking about your own ego.

11
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,393
Ego, reputation, what's the difference?

12
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,591
That's what I just said.

13
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:26,230
Anyway, my customers are just
gonna have to wait 'till I get me $50.

14
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,133
-Good.
-Good?

15
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,437
Shit.

16
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,472
Rich broads.

17
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,484
You never had to make a buck in your life.

18
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,483
I have to go out and hustle every day.

19
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,556
What are you doing?

20
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,325
Just sitting there in the bathtub
on your fat ass.

21
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,386
We ain't got nothing here.

22
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,754
We can't move.

23
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,294
And we ain't got much left
in the old cookie jar either.

24
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,030
But, Frank, you promised.

25
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,762
Maybe we could stay off the hard stuff
for a while and just smoke.

26
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,474
Yeah, but when I make this deal...

27
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,579
...we ain't even gonna
have to leave the house.

28
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,048
We can just groove and groove.

29
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,985
You can go down and get yourself
a year's supply of peanut butter.

30
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,749
I can get the hi-fi out of hock.

31
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,950
I can go to Netty's, get some brushes...

32
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,461
...and some paints and an easel
and a mile of canvas.

33
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,732
-Who paints?
-I paint.

34
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,069
You know I love you.

35
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,716
You got love, you don't need this stuff.

36
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,684
Is that the message?

37
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,919
Well, I love you, too.

38
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,057
So there.

39
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,138
You know, I was only kidding...

40
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,148
...about your painting.

41
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,629
I really like your paintings.

42
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,085
You're not gonna take that much yourself,
are you?

43
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,383
-You want a poke?
-No.

44
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,528
You didn't ask me where I was today.

45
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,137
Where do you think I was?

46
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,216
Did you think I was with some other guy?

47
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,191
-I went to my parents'.
-What the hell did you go there for?

48
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,991
It was near, my mother's birthday
was coming up, and....

49
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,227
I don't like to be here all by myself
when you're away.

50
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,633
And anyhow,
why should that freak you out so much?

51
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,667
It freaks me out.

52
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,168
You know it freaks me out.

53
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,483
How about some music?

54
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,924
Here.

55
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,931
That's okay.

56
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:32,809
You don't have to do this for me.

57
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,946
I understand about your parents.

58
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,750
It's got nothing to do with my parents.

59
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,761
Come on, babe, let's make love.

60
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,206
That fucking radiator!

61
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,040
When are you going to move the bed?

62
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,811
-Where you going?
-I'm gonna get me that $50.

63
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:23,785
That's crummy.

64
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,290
You promised
you weren't gonna do that anymore.

65
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,322
-You want me to sell my stuff?
-No.

66
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,228
So instead of a trip,
the teeny boppers get vitamin pills.

67
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,332
I'm doing them a favor. Shit.

68
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,570
With a line like that, I could run for mayor.

69
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,267
Please don't go. I don't feel very good.

70
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,572
Frank!

71
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:53,083
You'll be okay. I'll be right back.
It can't take too long.

72
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,153
Pop one up if you have to.
You'll feel great.

73
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,450
See you.

74
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,993
-How do I know it's any good, man?
-It's so good, you'll wish it wasn't so good.

75
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:40,465
-I got beat last week.
-That was last week. Now is now.

76
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,728
How about a taste up front?

77
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,566
Sorry, man. No samples. It's too good.

78
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,635
Let me see it man, okay?

79
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,673
Sure.

80
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,651
Here's a satisfied customer.

81
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,251
I don't need that, man.

82
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,688
Sit down.

83
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,269
Look, she's a bum tripper.

84
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:22,000
If your head's on straight, like yours is,
it's a groove.

85
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,868
It's dynamite.

86
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,410
It's you.

87
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,278
I'm hip.

88
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,291
You're a big help.

89
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:48,092
-I don't feel so good.
-Shit.

90
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,735
-Take it.
-No.

91
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,638
I said, take it.

92
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,712
Take it.

93
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,649
Now, go home.

94
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,555
Fifteen minutes, you'll be floating.

95
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,324
I just have one more pass to make,
and then I can get the stuff.

96
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,930
Okay?

97
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,534
Now, stop being such a drag,
for Christ's sake!

98
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,156
Hey, honey, what are you doing?

99
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,004
Hey, wait a minute.

100
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,512
-Take it easy.
-Let me go!

101
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,449
You'll be all right.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

102
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,715
-Easy, easy.
-Let go.

103
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,961
Nobody's going to hurt you.

104
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,018
That's it.

105
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:47,071
Sgt. O'Connor? Mr. Miller from
the Second Avenue bargain store.

106
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,180
Fine, sir.

107
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,716
We have a young girl here
who's flipped out.

108
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,285
Looks like she's OD'd on speed.

109
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,990
Hippie. You better send an ambulance.

110
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,692
Second and 7th.

111
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,197
You've got a weird sense of humor,
Sergeant.

112
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,903
Yes, sir.

113
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,474
Thank you. Good-bye.

114
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,249
She's coming down now
from the amphetamine.

115
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,720
A 100 milligrams of Thorazine
in the butt does wonders.

116
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,088
If you want her effects,
you can pick them up in the property room.

117
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,459
-Would you like to see her now?
-Yes, please, very much.

118
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,965
You won't have to stay here.

119
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:47,168
No, darling, you're going to Rivercrest.
It's a beautiful place, not like here.

120
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,838
No locked doors.

121
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,468
And Dr. Bergman said
you could be out within a week.

122
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,113
And when you come home, darling,
we'll all go someplace.

123
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,979
Maybe the Islands.

124
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,848
Frank would understand.

125
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:09,319
Listen, honey,
when you come out, we'll try again.

126
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,331
You know what I mean, talk it over and....

127
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,034
Maybe we haven't been as open
as we could.

128
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,831
We'll work it out, honey. It'll be okay.

129
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,743
I don't think this is such a good idea.

130
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,905
Go back, I'll do it myself.

131
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,381
No, she'll be furious.

132
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,011
Now that she's out of this environment,
maybe she'll come to her senses.

133
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,881
Good luck.

134
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,121
The smell, Bill,
I'm getting sick to my stomach.

135
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,853
I don't want to go up there.
I don't want to see it.

136
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,491
Will you stop bitching?
This is your own daughter.

137
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,195
For once in your life,
can you do something for her...

138
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,932
...without looking for
a convenient excuse not to?

139
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,496
You bastard!

140
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,407
I'll say this for you:
You're consistent, you don't change.

141
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,503
Go to Hell. And you can do it yourself.

142
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,815
All right, I will. It's no novelty.

143
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,417
Keep going, and make a right.

144
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,599
Okay. Who's got $10?

145
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,636
-No, wait a minute, let's see it first.
-Sure.

146
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,440
Is it any good?

147
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,009
Yeah, it's dynamite.

148
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,709
-You sure?
-Yeah, would I kid you?

149
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,894
-Okay.
-$10.

150
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,993
How long will it last?

151
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,696
As long as you want.
Depends on your head.

152
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,204
If we take it now,
will we be okay on the street?

153
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,241
Sure, anywhere you want.

154
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,436
-Have fun.
-Yeah, thanks.

155
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,773
-What's your name, man?
-The Lone Ranger.

156
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,113
Okay, well, you go first.

157
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:01,222
-No, that's okay, you can go first.
-All right, scaredy-cat, here.

158
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,592
Who are you?

159
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,736
Melissa's in the hospital.
I'm picking up her clothes.

160
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,077
Oh, you're Daddy.
I should've recognized the nose.

161
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,507
How's she doing?

162
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,852
Why, you want to bring her
some more pills?

163
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,551
Don't sweat the small stuff, she'll be okay.

164
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,933
Melissa told us you were handsome.
Rugged, she says.

165
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,802
Strong.

166
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,328
Intense.

167
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,704
-With great talent.
-Yeah?

168
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,870
Yes.

169
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,007
But as far as I can see,
you're a weak little bastard...

170
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,209
...who couldn't paint his way
out of a toilet.

171
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,716
How's things in the advertising world?

172
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,851
We can't all be geniuses.

173
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,788
How are your toasters doing?

174
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,224
You know,
Melissa's got a real hang-up about you.

175
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,122
You done a real groovy job on her.

176
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,261
That's pretty good,
from what Melissa says about her old lady.

177
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,772
I see you still got some balls.

178
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,570
Shut up!

179
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,668
She's got a real thing about you.

180
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,974
When I met her, she was balling
her way up the aisle at the film...

181
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:43,213
...and every now and then,
she used to like to try an old codger.

182
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:15,143
Get up! Get up, you skinny fucker!

183
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,490
Get up!

184
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,345
Oh, God.

185
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,755
Jesus!

186
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,927
The niggers.
The niggers are getting all the money.

187
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,935
Why work?
You tell me, why the fuck work...

188
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:21,598
...when you can screw,
have babies, and get paid for it?

189
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,742
Welfare. They got all that welfare money.

190
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,473
They even get free rubbers.

191
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,379
You think they use them?

192
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:33,042
Hell, no, the only way they make money
is making babies.

193
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,212
They sell the rubbers...

194
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,248
...and then they use the money
to buy booze.

195
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,226
Nobody has a right to booze
unless he earns the money.

196
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,859
It ought to be a law.
You don't work, you don't drink.

197
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,131
The social workers, the ones in Welfare....

198
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,696
How come they're all nigger lovers?

199
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:00,643
Ever notice that?
All those social workers are nigger lovers.

200
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,814
Find me a social worker
who ain't a nigger lover...

201
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,908
...and I'll massage your ass. I ain't queer.

202
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,951
-Scotch and water.
-Double for 90 cents, you save a dime.

203
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:22,094
I sweat my balls off 40 hours a week
in front of a fucking furnace.

204
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,669
They get as much money as I do
for nothing.

205
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,607
They got them living in hotels at $50 a day,
$1,000 a month.

206
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:35,702
Now they want charge accounts.
Charge accounts.

207
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,781
I ain't even been inside Macy's,
and they want charge accounts.

208
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:43,410
All you gotta do is act black,
and the money rolls in.

209
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,749
Set fire to the cities, burn a few buildings,
you get paid for it.

210
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,995
Throw a few bombs,
you get money and jobs.

211
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,859
If you can't read,
you got a better chance of getting hired.

212
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,495
A lot of good my education did me.

213
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,043
And the kids, the white kids.

214
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,981
They're worse than the niggers.

215
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,278
Money don't mean nothing to them.

216
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,415
Motorcycles, marijuana, $5 records.

217
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,323
The dollar ain't worth shit.

218
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,495
I get a 30-cent-an-hour increase.

219
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,465
My wife bought
better hamburger last year.

220
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,559
I got a kid.

221
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,400
Screw him. I got another kid.

222
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,702
Couldn't get into a regular college.
You want to know why?

223
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,808
My kid ain't dumb.

224
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,977
Couldn't get into college
because they let the niggers in first.

225
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,586
That's how they're saving the cities.

226
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:53,249
They keep the smart niggers busy
wrecking the colleges.

227
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:58,055
Yeah, my kid's grades....
Not like those kids in Chicago.

228
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,498
Chicago! They got no respect
for the President of the United States.

229
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:07,794
A few heads get bashed in,
they act like they got it in the ass.

230
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,861
Liberals.

231
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,934
42% of all liberals are queer.

232
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,039
That's a fact.

233
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,616
The Wallace people took a poll.

234
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:25,316
And don't tell me about Communists.
How can a kid be a Communist?

235
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,490
Kids are idealistic.

236
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,896
-Yes, P-Q-3 please.
-They used to be idealistic.

237
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,731
Now they're going to those peace marches.

238
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,927
This is William Compton.
Could you tell me how my daughter is?

239
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:42,098
They're so whacked out on drugs,
they need candles to find their way.

240
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,665
Oh? Well, when will he be back?

241
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,442
-The white kids....
-Would you ask him to call me?

242
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,074
-The rich white kids....
-Yes, the number here is....

243
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,448
-The worst, hippies....
-7-2-4....

244
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,580
Sugar tit all the way:
the cars, the best colleges...

245
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,521
...vacations, orgies...

246
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,652
-Yes, William Compton.
-...Christmas, Easter.

247
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,195
Thank you.

248
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,892
They go someplace,
like a fancy resort, and have orgies.

249
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,403
Easter orgies.

250
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,596
The day Christ rose,
they're all screwing one another.

251
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,004
The poor kids and the middle-class kids...

252
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,204
...they're all copying the rich kids.

253
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,874
They're all going the same
goddamn "screw America" way.

254
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,482
Hippies.

255
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,979
Joe, do me a favor. Give us all a break.

256
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,720
Can it a while.

257
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,889
Here's a quarter.
Go play the juke box, okay?

258
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,535
Want to do it again?

259
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:00,813
What's the matter, you got all those
opinions, and you can't pick a record?

260
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,910
Look at this shit music.

261
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:07,520
Those goddamn nigger-loving hippies,
they even fucked up the music.

262
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,925
I'd like to get my hands on
one of those little bastards.

263
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:14,055
I'd kill 'em. I'd like to kill one of them.

264
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,464
They're getting away with murder.

265
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:21,403
Sex, drugs, pissing on America,
fucking up the music.

266
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,839
I'd like to kill one of 'em.

267
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,878
I would.

268
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,412
I'd like to kill one of 'em.

269
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,610
I just did.

270
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,585
Glad to hear it.

271
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,294
Hey, you're serious!

272
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,955
You're really serious!

273
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:55,396
For Christ's sake, you had me going for it,
you had me believing you!

274
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,901
Jesus, you're a great kidder, Mac.

275
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,575
You had me going for it. I went for it.

276
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,209
You're puttin' me on. Terrific.
What are you drinking?

277
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,809
Hey, Pete, give this guy a drink.

278
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,481
No kidding, you're all right, Mac.

279
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,385
My name is Joe, Joe Curran.

280
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,485
What's yours?

281
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,624
Anyone here called William Compton?

282
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,462
He's all right, know what I mean?

283
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,198
Anybody who can set me in like that....

284
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,435
-Hello?
-Anybody who can make me laugh....

285
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,703
Yes.

286
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,841
-They're all right, you know.
-Doctor?

287
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,743
She is. Good.

288
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,816
Yes, tell her.

289
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:46,550
-This world needs a lot of laughs.
-Thank you. Good-bye.

290
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,760
You know?

291
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,123
You gotta be able to laugh, to roll with it.

292
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:03,037
Hey, Compton, I bought you a drink.

293
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,333
What is this?

294
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,174
Where have you been?

295
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,583
What in the world happened?

296
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,348
Where are Melissa's things?

297
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,794
What's wrong? Look at yourself, darling.
What happened?

298
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:45,140
Honey, are you about ready to go to bed?

299
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,112
Yeah, I'm gonna watch the 11:00 news.

300
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,213
-I'm gonna go on now.
-Okay.

301
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,629
Come on.

302
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,300
Come on, now, get in there, bastard.

303
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,199
Get in there, you bastard.

304
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:38,621
Hi, honey.

305
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,888
What's for supper?

306
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,590
Guess.

307
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,153
Come on.

308
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,655
No, guess.

309
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,122
For Christ's sake, tell me.

310
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:54,195
-It's on the stove, look.
-You got covers on, come on.

311
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:59,199
We're having mashed potatoes,
the way you like them, lumpy...

312
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:04,078
...and a nice piece of chuck steak,
the way you like, with onions and ketchup.

313
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,545
Heinz?

314
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:09,379
Yes, I'll never do that again,
buy the supermarket kind.

315
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,087
-You're right about ketchup.
-That's my girl.

316
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,650
And a nice piece of
Jane Parker chocolate fudge cake.

317
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,223
I tell the guys what a good cook you are.

318
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,462
You know,
my sandwiches are better than theirs.

319
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,696
How was Samantha Cartwright today?

320
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,672
She wasn't on so very much,
but a lot happened to her.

321
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,265
She's in the hospital
having her kidneys removed.

322
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,403
And while she's in the hospital,
her daughter, Kim...

323
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,470
...is being seduced by a lawyer...

324
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:41,678
...and her son, Biff, is getting
a little crushed in an elevator accident.

325
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,854
And it looks like her husband, Derek...

326
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,086
...is interested in her best friend, Phoebe.

327
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:56,558
While she's having her kidneys taken out...

328
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:01,297
...you see the knife going in,
Derek gives Phoebe such a look.

329
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,300
That woman, she has such courage.

330
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,972
That's my favorite program,
The Searching Light.

331
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,846
How was Mabel Archer?

332
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:17,010
Oh, well,
looks like things are looking up for her.

333
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,921
Looks like she's gonna have
a father for her baby.

334
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,049
The guy who knocked her up'll marry her?

335
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,492
-No.
-The guy she's in love with?

336
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,326
No, the gentleman she met
at the drugstore.

337
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,832
It looks like something's happening
between them.

338
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,535
What happened down the block?

339
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,874
-The boys are out.
-I see the boys are out. What happened?

340
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:45,273
Brian has a date with Patty,
the girl who wears the Indian headband?

341
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:49,146
She wears an Indian headband.
Mary Lou, are you gonna answer me?

342
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,058
They moved in.

343
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,026
They don't look so bad for Colored, Joe.

344
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,195
What are you gonna do?

345
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,576
Shit, where's Phil?

346
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:19,207
He's out riding.
He picked up the Harley Davidson today.

347
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:22,514
He got it? Shit.

348
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,919
I'm going to go downstairs. Call me.

349
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,492
It's not going to be very long.
It's just gonna....

350
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,905
...black militants abroad.

351
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,974
Overseas agents of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation...

352
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,606
...and the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs...

353
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,809
...originally scheduled for reduction....

354
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,351
The van came about 11:00.

355
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,783
They got nice furniture for Colored.

356
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:45,928
Have a real nice Castro
and a fancy bedroom suite.

357
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:48,396
...pose a serious threat
to our government....

358
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,194
The kids are cute. They're clean, too.

359
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,930
New York's Greenwich Village.

360
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,099
I think they're real high-class Colored...

361
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,144
...different from anything around here.

362
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,475
-...in an apartment on 4th Street.
-Hold it.

363
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:08,211
The man, Frank Russo, had been dead
three days according to the examiner.

364
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,082
-I think he's not going--
-Shut up!

365
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,783
Russo, sometime painter,
had been selling drugs, police said.

366
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:17,019
Investigation revealed that
he had picked up a large shipment...

367
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,755
...the day that he was killed.

368
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:23,357
Police believe Russo was killed by a junkie
who then fled with the drugs.

369
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:27,734
Detectives say there are no leads
to the killer at the present time.

370
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,703
Albany: Federal State crime investigators
are expected to serve subpoenas...

371
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,268
...on state government figures
possibly involved...

372
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:39,248
...with illegal activities of the Mafia.

373
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,748
The subpoenaed witnesses will be ordered
to appear before two grand juries...

374
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:46,084
...probing malfeasance and bribery.

375
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,100
Mr. Compton's office.

376
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,672
Hello, Mr. Compton, please.

377
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,376
Joe Curran.

378
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,044
Yeah, you do that.

379
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,883
There's a Mr. Curran on the line.

380
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,986
Who?

381
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,425
Joe Curran.

382
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,224
I don't know him. Tell him I'm busy.

383
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,531
Mr. Compton is in conference.

384
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:37,638
Tell him I'm Joe Curran,
the guy he met in the bar the other night...

385
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,176
...and bought him a drink.
I wanna talk to him now.

386
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,272
Very well.

387
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,243
What?

388
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:55,185
He says he met you in a bar the other night
and bought you a drink.

389
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,930
Okay, I'll talk to him.

390
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:09,995
Hello?

391
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,370
Hello, Compton.

392
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,512
Listen, I wanna see you.

393
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,471
How did you get my number?

394
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,549
You're the only one in the book.
The maid gave me your office.

395
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,087
Look, Compton, we gotta get together.

396
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:28,249
Look, you meet me at the Bowl-a-drome
around 6:00.

397
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,024
That's Camwood and Grant Street
in Astoria.

398
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,961
Around 6:00, okay?

399
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,032
Yes, okay.

400
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,271
I'll see you then.

401
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,496
Okay.

402
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,600
Compton. Over here.

403
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,303
Hey, you look okay, pal.

404
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,840
Hey, everybody, listen.

405
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:28,214
I want you to meet a great guy.
This guy's got real balls...

406
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,082
...not no bowling balls.

407
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:35,948
This is Jack, Sam, Michael,
he don't like to be called Mike, and Art.

408
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,996
Would you like to bowl a frame? Come on.

409
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:44,561
I bet you haven't had much exercise
for a couple of days.

410
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,659
Here we go.

411
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,864
Hey, you creeps,
this guy's gonna bowl a frame for me.

412
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,634
Come on, show these bums.

413
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,777
My shoes.... Street shoes.

414
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,810
Fuck the shoes, come on.

415
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,712
-Maybe your buddy ought to stick to golf.
-Golf?

416
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,618
Screw it, forget it.

417
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,626
This game's for morons, anyway.

418
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,193
Come on,
you guys got chalk in your brains.

419
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,029
Hey, Jack,
finish this string for me, will you?

420
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,294
Come on, I want to talk to you.

421
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,146
Couple of beers, please, Sylvia.

422
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,482
Catch you later.

423
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:54,126
You know when it hit me?
When I saw the paper.

424
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,130
The TV started me thinking.

425
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,343
The paper, I knew.

426
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,604
Couldn't get over it.

427
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:09,941
Why?

428
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,314
Why did you call me?

429
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,221
I wanted to meet you.

430
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,055
I know what you've been thinking.

431
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:28,766
You been thinking I was going to
put the old squeeze on you, didn't you?

432
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:33,535
That's what you been thinking, right?

433
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,367
Yes.

434
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,882
The thought had occurred to me.

435
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,561
I could blackmail you.

436
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,265
Hey, don't worry about it.

437
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,668
I just wanted to shake your hand.

438
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,098
I mean...

439
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,100
...there I am, sitting in a bar...

440
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,809
...drunk, and shooting off....

441
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,370
Just words...

442
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:13,908
...and you come in.

443
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,952
And you did it! You did it!

444
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:21,119
I just talk about it, but you did it!

445
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:30,625
When I get drunk, I let off a lot of steam.

446
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,194
Drink up.

447
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,765
I know a better place.

448
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,281
Thank you.

449
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,717
Listen, nobody's gonna blame you...

450
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,992
...a guy like that, your daughter.

451
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:04,266
There're plenty of people with kids,
I'm telling you, you'd be a hero.

452
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,470
The guy was selling dope, right?

453
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:11,901
So now he can't make dope fiends
out of anybody anymore, can he?

454
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,709
Yeah, that's right.

455
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,479
God knows how many kids he hooked.

456
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:22,983
Maybe....

457
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,089
Maybe that's why I get this....

458
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,821
I had it a couple of times lately.

459
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,660
The feeling of...

460
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,725
...pleasure?

461
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,734
Satisfaction.

462
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,832
Yeah, like in the war.

463
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:49,777
You remember how you felt in the war
sometimes, after you killed a few of them?

464
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:53,077
You feel bad and you feel good
at the same time?

465
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,117
Yes, well, something like that.

466
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,145
Not exactly.

467
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,054
You make a lot of money.

468
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:08,930
How much?

469
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,726
What do you make an hour?

470
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,570
They pay us by the year, Joe.

471
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,938
I get $4 an hour...

472
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:24,811
...plus some that I don't count
because the union keeps it.

473
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,945
That's $160 a week.

474
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:31,977
That ain't so bad, it's not so bad.
I mean, shit, you can't live on it.

475
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,654
What do you make?

476
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,023
$60,000.

477
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,225
$60,000 a year!

478
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,736
You gotta be kidding.

479
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,074
Only movie stars make that kind of money.

480
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:56,739
The fucking president of my union
pays himself that kinda money.

481
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,974
$60,000 a year.

482
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,053
You gotta kiss a lot of ass, I bet.

483
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:15,354
After a while, you don't notice it, I guess.

484
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,530
You think I don't have to kiss ass?
$4 an hour?

485
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:24,032
The foreman, the shop steward,
the guy on the night shift...

486
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,940
...so he don't leave my furnace a mess.

487
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,637
Bet you got a pile saved, though.

488
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:35,410
No, not really a pile, only about...

489
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:39,988
...$18,000.

490
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,250
$18,000, the kind of money you make?

491
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,591
I got $10,000. My wife don't know it.

492
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,964
Yeah, and two lots in Florida.

493
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,710
Hey, look at that.

494
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,608
Look at that.

495
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,279
Nice.

496
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,821
I like to look at 'em once in a while.

497
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,948
You like to look at 'em once in a while?

498
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,124
Yes, I like to look at it once in a while.

499
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,559
A little on the side once in a while?

500
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:26,900
Once in a while.

501
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:31,239
That helps, you know,
so you don't resent the old lady so much.

502
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,502
Right?

503
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,842
You know, guys like us...

504
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:44,720
...we don't often get a chance
to talk to each other.

505
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,385
-Find it hard talking to me?
-No.

506
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,849
Yes, you do.

507
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,630
I'm just a working stiff,
and you're way up there.

508
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:56,864
Educated.

509
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:03,465
Just talk to me the way you would...

510
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,640
...somebody at the office,
a friend, like that.

511
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,684
Would you like to see
where my kind of animal hangs out?

512
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,843
Sure.

513
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,716
Good. Now, let's get the hell out of here.

514
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,814
They look like a bunch of fags.

515
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,686
Not really fags, but close, getting there.

516
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,191
What would you like, sir?

517
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,887
-Johnnie Walker on the rocks and....
-The same.

518
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:04,827
Yeah, but they're smart.
They gotta be smart, right?

519
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:09,198
You want to see
how smart they really are? Watch.

520
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,364
Bill, baby, how are you?

521
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:15,434
Gil. It's good to see you.
I'd like you to meet Joe Curran.

522
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,136
-This is Gil Richards.
-Happy to meet you.

523
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,374
Same here.

524
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,077
By the way, Gil, Joe here is....

525
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,947
-Shall I tell him, Joe?
-Oh, yeah.

526
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:34,296
It hasn't been officially announced yet,
but Joe here is moving over to your shop.

527
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,695
Oh, yeah?

528
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,567
What spot?

529
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,599
Guess.

530
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,196
Hell, I don't know. Which....

531
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:47,903
Come on, Gil, what have they been
looking for over there for three months?

532
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,410
Exec VP?

533
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,215
That's it.

534
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:59,286
I know he looks a little rough,
but that's just part of his act.

535
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,816
He'll be looking things over
pretty closely over there.

536
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:07,386
Getting rid of a lot of dead wood.
You'll shake it up over there, won't you?

537
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:12,458
I'll shake things up. That place will
shake like a hurricane when a tree hit it.

538
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,498
When you come in, drop by my office.

539
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,967
Nah, why don't you drop by my office?

540
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:25,470
Yeah, sure. I'll see you.

541
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:51,537
Look, no hands, doctor's orders.

542
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:56,302
Can't lift anything heavier than 10 pounds.

543
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,845
Hey, they got ice down there.

544
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,316
I never pissed on ice before.

545
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,381
-Don't catch cold.
-I'll try not to.

546
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,214
Feels good!

547
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:16,431
This is one of nature's simple enjoyments.

548
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,628
I needed that, you know.

549
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,042
After you, my dear Alphonse.

550
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,448
All right.

551
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,247
Now, you see those buildings, Joe?

552
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:43,587
Those beautiful monuments...

553
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,361
...concrete, glass.

554
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,855
I work in one of them.

555
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,336
You know what they do in those buildings?

556
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,169
They move paper.

557
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,538
That's right. They pick it up in one place...

558
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:06,173
...and they move it to another place.

559
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,117
They pass it all around their offices.

560
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,781
And the more paper you move...

561
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:19,451
...the more important you are,
the more they pay you.

562
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:25,432
If you want to really show
how important you are...

563
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,993
...what you can get away with...

564
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:31,063
...you make little paper airplanes...

565
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:36,869
...and you sail them
right up somebody else's ass.

566
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:43,951
Do you ever get the feeling
that everything you do...

567
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:49,725
...your whole life,
just one big crock of shit?

568
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,324
Yeah.

569
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:05,340
I got a great idea. Wanna go huntin'?

570
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,372
-Hunting?
-Yeah.

571
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,775
I haven't gone hunting in years.

572
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,814
-I got a great place, you know.
-Yeah?

573
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:15,112
You should've seen the buck
I got last year, big one.

574
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,277
-You know what else you gotta do?
-What?

575
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:20,322
You gotta come out to the house,
meet the little woman...

576
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,621
...have a little dinner with us,
see how the other half lives, okay?

577
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:24,887
Okay, Joe.

578
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,451
-Okay, Compton?
-It's a deal.

579
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,827
Take care, Compton, and just remember...

580
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,061
...you don't have anything
to worry about, okay?

581
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:39,597
You won't believe this, darling,
but I have just been...

582
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,769
...with a guy who knows.

583
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:43,206
What?

584
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,939
It's all right. He likes me.

585
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,648
Rest up.
The doctor said only a few more days.

586
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,746
-I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

587
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,917
-Good-bye, darling.
-Bye, mother.

588
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,357
Well, say good-bye to daddy for me.

589
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:24,152
-Excuse me.
-Yes, surely.

590
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:47,142
-Hi.
-Phyllis. How'd you ever find me?

591
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,370
Spies.

592
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:52,472
-Hey, you don't look so bad.
-Well, I could look a lot worse.

593
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:56,644
My mother was just here.
She's been here every day, twice a day.

594
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,118
Twice a day?

595
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:01,418
Well, she can't be that bad.
You ought to meet my mother.

596
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,425
Well, so how's Frank?

597
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,723
Stop it, for Christ's sake!
You'd think the Pope was comin'!

598
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,858
What am I gonna talk to her about?

599
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:14,494
You never had any trouble
talkin' with the girls.

600
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,130
Shuttin' you up was the problem.

601
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,670
Joe, I didn't dust.

602
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:22,074
Look, you buy curtains, she buys curtains.

603
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,204
I give you a few bucks in Gimbels,
you go crazy.

604
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,806
You give her a few bucks in Gimbels,
she goes crazy.

605
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:31,843
-She doesn't shop at Gimbels, Joe.
-Okay, she goes to Macy's.

606
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,226
Women got a lot to talk about, they think.

607
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,826
Relax.

608
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:56,144
Won't be any worse than the time
your rich aunt came over...

609
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,976
...the one who didn't leave us any money.

610
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,175
-Hi.
-Joe.

611
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,014
Come in.
Mary Lou's been dyin' to meet you.

612
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:07,989
-Mary Lou, this is Bill Compton.
-It's a pleasure.

613
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,491
Hello. My wife, Joan.

614
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,584
How do you do?

615
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,288
-Hello.
-Nice knowin' you.

616
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:17,432
Here, let me take your coats.
Take their coats, honey.

617
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:19,567
-Let me help.
-Sure.

618
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:22,069
My best friend in high school
was named Mary Lou.

619
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:25,904
I loved her name.
I always wished I had it. I hated mine.

620
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:29,738
-Well, you've got a nice name, Joan.
-Thank you.

621
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,710
Well, I'll just be a minute.

622
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,182
I can see we're gonna get along real good.

623
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,652
What'll you have, a Bud or 7 and 7?

624
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,348
Bud or 7 and 7?

625
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,981
We got ginger ale, too.

626
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,891
Yes, how will you have your
Seagram's 7 Crown, dear?

627
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,991
Ginger ale or 7-Up?

628
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,621
Ginger ale's fine, thank you.

629
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,633
Ginger ale, beautiful.
And for the gentleman?

630
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,134
-Bud.
-Bud, the king of beers.

631
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,972
-Where's the ginger ale?
-Under the....

632
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:10,416
-I thought you keep it on the shelf.
-I do keep it on the shelf, but--

633
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,647
Did you have any trouble findin' the place?

634
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,853
No, Joe. Your instructions were perfect.

635
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,357
Terrific.

636
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,526
-Joe?
-Yeah.

637
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:24,191
-Pretty nice place you got here.
-Yeah, it's not much.

638
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:31,935
You never told me you had a girlfriend
named Mary Lou in high school.

639
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,407
I made it up.

640
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:39,709
God, you can be charming
when you wanna be.

641
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,823
I hope you don't mind the can.

642
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:53,293
No. It helps to keep them fresh.

643
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,829
Nice nuts.

644
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:59,060
No, thanks. I mustn't spoil my appetite.

645
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,694
-Do you mind if I shut the window?
-No, go right ahead.

646
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:07,303
I love your curtains.

647
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:08,934
Thank you.

648
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,370
See, what'd I tell you?

649
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:21,179
They was 49 cents a yard, reduced from 79.

650
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:24,954
I made 'em myself,
and the saleslady told me that...

651
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:28,087
...Debbie Reynolds had been in
and bought the same material.

652
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,791
That's enough.

653
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:33,996
All day.

654
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,803
She was wonderin' what you
was gonna talk about.

655
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,670
I told her you was both women.

656
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,175
That's right. We're all alike.

657
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,611
What'd you mean by that?

658
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,548
That's the restaurant.

659
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:51,678
We're going to have something
real special for dinner. Chinese.

660
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,082
Lou Wong's is the best Chinese....

661
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:58,252
The best Chinese restaurant
in Astoria, it's--

662
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,529
-I hope you like Chinese food.
-I love it.

663
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,326
Yes, love it.

664
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:51,209
Give me the box. They look better
when they're all lined up here together.

665
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,021
The boys just hate Chinese food.
That's why they're out.

666
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:09,928
Hell, that's not why they're not home,
they're never home, not even the good one.

667
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:20,506
Joe's real funny about the boys.
He likes 'em right here when he comes in.

668
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:26,277
What he'd like is to have 'em all lined up,
military fashion, in the doorway...

669
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:29,077
...when he comes home, sayin', "Hi, Pop."

670
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,048
Yeah.

671
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:40,927
I was really sorry to hear
about your daughter. Is she okay?

672
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,092
She's fine, thank you.

673
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,497
Kids.

674
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,572
Everything today's kids.

675
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,812
They make you feel so old-fashioned,
you know?

676
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:08,620
We made our parents feel
old-fashioned, but...

677
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:13,824
...we didn't make them feel old-fashioned
like the kids make us feel old-fashioned.

678
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,295
Everything today's kids.

679
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,570
-They are taking over the culture.
-The what?

680
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:30,477
The culture:
the movies, books, clothes, music.

681
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,870
Yeah, yeah.

682
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:36,676
They're all screwed up,
so they got control of the culture, right?

683
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:39,585
They're all screwed up,
so they're screwin' up the culture.

684
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,987
It ain't what the kids say,
we screwed them up.

685
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,720
It's the other way around,
with all that culture crap.

686
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:50,964
It's the kids who are screwin' us up.
Am I right?

687
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,694
Yes, of course.

688
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,030
Fuckin' A.

689
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:04,240
-You mean, she knows you killed a junkie?
-Yes, she knows.

690
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,874
-What'd you do, go and tell her?
-No, she figured it out, just as you did.

691
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,379
Christ. Here.

692
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,490
-What are you doing?
-Don't worry, relax.

693
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,261
Joan, I got something I wanna show you.

694
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:25,232
Joe, she don't wanna see your guns.

695
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,997
Sure she does, it'll just take a minute.

696
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:33,238
-What the hell did you go and do that for?
-Don't worry, you'll see.

697
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:40,081
Look, it's not the gun, I just wanted to
get you away from Mary Lou.

698
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,343
See, look.

699
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,715
I want to tell you not to worry
about a thing...

700
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,482
...'cause nothing's gonna happen to you.

701
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:50,218
Your husband's a great guy,
and nothin's gonna happen to him.

702
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:54,695
The police in this town ain't gonna
bust their ass over one junkie murder.

703
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:58,563
See, a guy who kills one junkie
might kill another junkie.

704
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:03,638
So why bust him? He's doin'
such good work for the cops, see?

705
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,034
That make you feel better?

706
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:08,600
Yes, thank you.

707
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:11,874
Okay, now I want you to go upstairs,
I want you to relax.

708
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:15,246
I want you to enjoy yourself
with Mary Lou, okay?

709
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:20,581
I got here what you might call
a well-balanced gun collection, see?

710
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,251
I wrote a letter to an ammo magazine,
and they wrote back, sayin':

711
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,886
"You got a well-balanced collection," see?

712
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:30,728
Now, this I got off a Jap,
a dead Jap on Okinawa.

713
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,867
Then I got.... Here, hold this.

714
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:40,274
Here is my old M-1. There's a lotta stories
behind that, believe me.

715
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:42,370
Right on the Park?

716
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:45,504
Yes, it is lovely. We have a beautiful view.

717
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:49,774
I never been in an apartment
like that before, never.

718
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,413
I always wondered what it'd be like,
what it'd look like on the inside.

719
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:57,255
-I always wanted to see.
-We'll have you and Joe up one day.

720
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,317
-You will?
-Yes, of course.

721
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:04,663
That'd be nice. What about next week?
Tuesday, Saturday....

722
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,561
Saturday'd be good for us.

723
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,971
I got a lot of other stuff over here, too.

724
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:12,371
Got some handguns, some shotguns.

725
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,602
I got a couple of trophies
for marksmanship.

726
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:18,010
I'm a real good shot. But this....

727
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:23,617
This is my beauty. It's a submachine gun.

728
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:26,846
You're not supposed to have 'em,
but I got one anyway.

729
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:31,450
You can do a lot of damage with this.
It's got a lot of stoppin' power.

730
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,598
Thanks for letting me in.

731
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:49,510
Before we were finished, we practically
worked out a full year's social calendar.

732
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:53,644
I think we have a free weekend
sometime in April or May.

733
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:57,782
Are you ready to put him up
for the athletic club?

734
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:04,424
I wouldn't mind letting him sit in
on one of our creative sessions...

735
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:08,788
...and let him tell everybody
what a bunch of windbags they are.

736
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,559
He wouldn't put it quite like that.

737
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:15,893
You know,
after years of nothing but ad types...

738
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:20,838
...Mary Lou, Joe,
they're a refreshing change.

739
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,234
Refreshing?

740
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:26,904
Well, different?

741
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:29,746
That's for sure.

742
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:45,791
Lord, I've been in grisly situations before,
but this....

743
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:50,434
Sitting in that room,
him knowing about Frank...

744
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:54,875
...and you and me knowing about Frank...

745
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:58,446
...and big-eyed Mary Lou, yammering away.

746
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,277
Does he know all the gory details, darling?

747
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:06,814
No.

748
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:15,625
When I think.... I just get the shudders.

749
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:32,080
When you think
that man holds our lives in his hand....

750
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:35,174
It's like sitting on a powder keg.

751
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:38,918
A couple of times tonight,
I said something, and he was...

752
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:41,114
...just about to explode.

753
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:45,418
If he gets mad at you, do you know
he can go straight to the police?

754
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,529
No, you see...

755
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:52,965
...the crazy thing about Joe is that...

756
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,669
...it's as if he shared in it.

757
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,572
As if he killed that boy, too.

758
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:04,078
You have to keep on the good side of him.

759
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:08,448
Isn't that what we were
really doing there tonight?

760
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:17,490
There's something else about Joe.
Sometimes, with him...

761
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:24,530
...I almost feel as if what I did was
a humanitarian act.

762
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:30,531
I saved the world
from another lousy junkie.

763
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,040
-Funny, isn't it?
-What?

764
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,552
How you can learn to live with anything...

765
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,414
...even murder.

766
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,659
I'll drink to that.

767
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:02,301
Melissa.

768
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,965
How did you get out of the hospital?

769
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:10,137
Why didn't you tell me about Frank?

770
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,781
Why didn't you tell me Frank was dead?

771
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,679
Because we didn't want to upset you.

772
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,618
Not while you were in the hospital.

773
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,520
Is that the reason?

774
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,526
Certainly, you were just coming down
from the drugs.

775
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,430
Or was the subject too painful?

776
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:39,607
I heard you, Daddy. You killed Frank.

777
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:46,409
And I loved him. I loved him.

778
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:49,674
Melissa. You stay here. I'll get her.

779
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,287
Melissa, I wanted to tell you.

780
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:07,462
-I wanted to tell you how it happened.
-It doesn't matter. It happened, that's all.

781
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:19,240
-You might understand.
-No!

782
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,580
-Melissa.
-Leave me alone!

783
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:36,791
-You've got to listen to me.
-Are you gonna kill me, too?

784
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,974
"There is some consternation
in these quarters...

785
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,171
"...about the allocation of spots to stations.

786
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:56,514
"I'd like you to reexamine them
from the point of view of demographics...

787
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,746
"...and market proceedings."

788
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,477
Paragraph.

789
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:05,722
"I know this puts you under pressure,
but we'd like it within a week.

790
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:10,658
"I'll commiserate with you over drinks."
Signature.

791
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:19,933
Janine, I know my behavior has been
a little erratic the last few days.

792
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:25,310
Well, it's likely to continue so
for a little while longer.

793
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:27,978
You know, running in and out of the office.

794
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:30,848
So just keep covering for me, will you?

795
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:32,752
I always do.

796
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:35,790
Thank you.

797
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,917
-Yes.
-Mr. Curran for you.

798
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:41,485
Put him on.

799
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:45,094
-Hiya, Compton.
-Joe, hold it a minute, will you?

800
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:48,594
That'll be all, Janine. Thank you.

801
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,637
Joe, I've been meaning to call you.

802
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,778
About tomorrow night, it's....

803
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:05,445
Well, it looks as if
we're just not gonna be able to make it.

804
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:07,143
Yeah?

805
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:09,053
Melissa ran away from the hospital.

806
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:12,560
She found out what happened.

807
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,721
She found out? How could she find out?

808
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,329
Well, I'll tell you when I see you.

809
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,335
I've been down in the Village every night
trying to find her.

810
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:22,734
Look, I'll go with you.

811
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:27,139
I'm falling off my feet.
I was thinkin' about getting to bed early.

812
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:30,076
No, can't stop lookin'.
You gotta keep lookin'.

813
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,743
It'll be easier if you got company.
I'll go with you.

814
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,875
Okay, I'll meet you
down in the Village around 8:00.

815
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:40,752
There's a parking lot
at Bowery and East 5th Street.

816
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,086
Okay, I'll see you.

817
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,891
Bye, Joe.

818
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:04,879
This could be a long night.

819
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:08,848
That's all right, I been wantin'
to see these animals, where they live.

820
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,942
-Okay.
-Let's go.

821
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,647
It's colder than a witch's tit out.

822
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:23,556
-Say, mister, you got any spare change?
-No, but I know where there's a spare job.

823
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,099
Dumb honky.

824
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:28,700
I like that.
That guy, he never got that before.

825
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,102
Used to be,
you had to be 40 or 50 years old...

826
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:34,233
...before you could
become a bum on the streets.

827
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,746
Look at that shit.

828
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,415
Cowboys and Indians.

829
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,078
Well, they grew up on television.

830
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:50,085
Hopalong Cassidy at the age of three.

831
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:54,251
Hopalong Cassidy. Real revolutionaries.

832
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,994
-Let's go in here.
-The Cauldron?

833
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:05,562
She used to mention this place.
Maybe she'll come in.

834
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:09,872
-How's that for a half-assed idea?
-All I know is, I need a drink.

835
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:20,550
There's some room in the back,
but you have to take your shoes off.

836
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:35,595
Take off your shoes? What is that bullshit?

837
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:38,134
Well, when in Rome....

838
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,935
What? What do you mean?

839
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:42,101
You do as the Romans do.

840
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,006
Yeah.

841
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:04,262
He looks like a truck driver.

842
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,927
What's that word they got?
"Groovin'?" "Groovy?"

843
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:13,498
If they're not screwin', they're groovin'.

844
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:17,311
Screwin' and groovin'.

845
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,813
Good evening, gentlemen.
Would you like to order?

846
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:22,907
-Got Imperial?
-Sorry, we don't serve alcohol here.

847
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,177
You don't serve alcohol here?

848
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,484
Well, what do you serve?

849
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,423
We serve shrimp tempura kakiage,
miso soup....

850
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,891
That's Jap food.

851
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:33,985
Not really. It's macrobiotic.

852
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,724
It's food in accordance
with the order of the universe.

853
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:54,313
Looks a little bit like Susie.

854
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,881
No, her eyes are different.

855
01:20:56,952 --> 01:20:59,420
Doesn't look a thing like Susie.

856
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:01,680
At least they still got booze.

857
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:02,745
Come on, kids.

858
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:06,920
Melissa Compton, she's about 5'8",
about 20 years old...

859
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,220
...auburn hair.

860
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:10,889
Melissa Compton.

861
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:14,168
-No, mister.
-Why don't you get a haircut?

862
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:19,264
Joe, take it easy.

863
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:25,703
No, can't say that I see this one.

864
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:30,308
Why don't you put it up on bulletin board
behind you with note? Here is paper.

865
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,410
-You have pencil?
-Yes, thank you.

866
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:36,890
-Maybe she come in and see.
-Yes, maybe she will.

867
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,802
That stuff they got at Niagara Falls,
the Empire State Building...

868
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:55,308
...pennants, pens, gimmicks.

869
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:59,575
I tell Mary Lou not to buy that stuff.
It's junk. She buys it anyway.

870
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:03,243
This stuff, what's the difference?
Junk is junk, right?

871
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:12,088
All I know is these fucking kids
are getting' more than we ever did.

872
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:25,530
Look at that.

873
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,541
The President of the United States:

874
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:31,909
If you can't buy a used car from him
who can you buy a used car from?

875
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,682
Guys, I'm gonna split.
See you up there later?

876
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:44,725
-Sure, we'll see you there.
-Great, peace.

877
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:50,254
-Let's get something to eat.
-At least it's warm here.

878
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,749
-It's pretty hopeless, isn't it?
-What?

879
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:15,582
-I said, it's hopeless.
-Oh, yeah.

880
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:23,827
Yeah, you gotta hang in there,
know what I mean? You can't give up.

881
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:36,036
The truck driver digs you.

882
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,702
Obviously, he's got good taste.

883
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,622
You want to turn a trick?

884
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,858
That's lovely, a hippie pimp?

885
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:55,486
I'm gonna put those guys on.

886
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:03,969
You guys lookin' for some grass, maybe?

887
01:24:06,908 --> 01:24:09,001
I got all I need, sonny.

888
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,578
You kiddin'? You really have some?

889
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:24,314
From the junkie,
still have it in the trunk of my car.

890
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:30,863
You know what that guy said?
I said, "You guys lookin' for some grass?"

891
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,457
You yo-yo,
they could be narcs or somethin'.

892
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:36,763
They ain't narcs.

893
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:39,966
I know narcs. Narcs have long hair.

894
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:43,669
I thought we could
lay some oregano on them.

895
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:45,906
They wouldn't know the difference.

896
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:50,917
So the old guy says,
"I've got all I need, sonny."

897
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:54,048
Suppose he's serious?

898
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:59,082
Guys like that? They wouldn't have grass.
Nobody's got grass.

899
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:01,189
Sure.

900
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:08,301
Man, you puttin' me on?
You really got some grass?

901
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,496
Yeah, that's what I said.

902
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,338
Well, we're having a little party.

903
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:17,901
We could all smoke some,
at one of the chicks' pads.

904
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:20,480
No, thanks.

905
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,717
Be pretty groovy, if you know what I mean.

906
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:25,819
I know what you mean.

907
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:33,994
-That's not such a bad idea.
-What?

908
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:36,360
Well, we're not getting' no place this way.

909
01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:38,831
This way, we get to know the kids.

910
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:42,596
You know, we get friendly,
we infiltrate them, you know what I mean?

911
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:46,970
Then maybe they'll tell us something
about your daughter. Just see.

912
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:49,372
You don't have to smoke the stuff.

913
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:56,478
Well, maybe you're right.

914
01:25:57,185 --> 01:25:59,551
-What have I got to lose?
-What?

915
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:02,789
What have I got to lose?

916
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:05,417
Well, then, let's go to the party.

917
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:18,365
Far fuckin' out!
The grass famine is finally over!

918
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:21,375
This is fantastic.

919
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,672
You got the record on pretty fuckin' loud.

920
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:25,713
Sorry, do you want me to turn it down?

921
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,838
Yeah.

922
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,479
You know I read in Mechanics Illustrated
that sound can hurt your ears.

923
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:34,315
Yeah, I wouldn't wanna do that.

924
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:39,893
Acid, grass, look at this chunk of hash.

925
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:43,362
Coke, speed, psilocybin.

926
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:49,065
-Am I gonna trip.
-You're in the business?

927
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:52,696
No, his mother is a junkie.

928
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:56,073
Solid.

929
01:26:57,078 --> 01:27:01,481
Mary Lou ought to see this place.
They got some great decoratin' ideas.

930
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:10,680
Far out.

931
01:27:13,494 --> 01:27:18,193
If you could fit it into all your openings:
your nose, your eyes, your ears....

932
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:22,266
It's a great fucking drug.
We fucked for hours.

933
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,305
Yeah. Definitely.

934
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:32,902
It's like a dream, you know?
It's like a drug head's dream.

935
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:40,878
-Come on, dance.
-I can't.

936
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:44,823
Yes, you can, you just do anything,
anything at all. Come on.

937
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:49,823
Think of this part
as the center of your body.

938
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,229
Just move it from the hips out.

939
01:27:52,533 --> 01:27:55,058
You mean, that's where I feel the music,
down there?

940
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:58,867
Right, that's it, you're getting it.
From the balls out.

941
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:02,603
From the balls out, right?
Groovy, that's where it's at.

942
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:12,547
-Here.
-No, thanks.

943
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,748
What's the matter? It won't kill you.
Chicken?

944
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:25,395
What you do is suck in deep,
and then hold it until it hurts.

945
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,497
You don't need to tell me.
I seen it on TV all the time.

946
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:40,177
I better sit down here, you know,
in case I get drunk...

947
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:43,581
...or it hits me all of a sudden.
I gotta sit down.

948
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:55,626
It's no good, it's panda piss.
Come on. Get with the Pepsi generation.

949
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:00,958
-You're kidding.
-No. Chicken?

950
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:06,132
-What do you mean, chicken?
-Chickie, chickie.

951
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:11,968
You think I'm chicken?

952
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:13,502
All right.

953
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:17,846
You think I'm chicken, huh?

954
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:22,589
You think I don't know how.
You watch this.

955
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:45,643
You still think I'm chicken?

956
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:49,349
All right, my friend.

957
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:05,527
I don't feel any different.

958
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:17,275
-Free yourself.
-Free yourself.

959
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:30,115
I lived all my life,
I ain't never been to an orgy.

960
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:32,819
This is an orgy, isn't it?

961
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:38,329
Yes, it seems to fit the definition.

962
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:39,995
Fuckin' A.

963
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:54,313
They're touching.

964
01:30:56,284 --> 01:31:00,084
The new sex, like eating.

965
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:05,120
Screwin' like that,
you can't be very important.

966
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:09,922
Well, what you lose in importance...

967
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:12,697
...you make up in frequency.

968
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,967
How do they fall in love?

969
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:27,037
It was better for you than for me.

970
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:31,484
-Thanks a lot.
-Can I have the dope?

971
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,654
Why don't you give the old guys a break?

972
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:40,626
It's not a bad idea.

973
01:31:57,378 --> 01:31:59,369
I hope I'm not out of line.

974
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:02,541
If you want it that bad, man,
you can have it.

975
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:06,949
Well, take off your clothes.

976
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:12,949
I don't have to take my clothes off.
I can make it without takin' off my clothes.

977
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:16,162
If you want to make it with me,
take off your clothes.

978
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:27,066
Where we gonna do it? Here?

979
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:31,502
I mean, you got another bed
in another room?

980
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:33,972
You do have another bed in another room?

981
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:36,016
Your friend's pretty uptight, isn't he?

982
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:40,213
Mirrors. Watching ourselves
was as far as my generation ever got.

983
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:42,620
You mean you never got into whips
or anything?

984
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:45,523
-Socks, too.
-Socks, too?

985
01:32:45,826 --> 01:32:47,623
She's anti-fetish.

986
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:18,082
You want me?

987
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:20,291
Why not?

988
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:25,890
You mean...

989
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:32,965
...What the World Needs Now,
and all that sort of thing?

990
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:35,608
Something like that.

991
01:33:55,162 --> 01:33:57,824
You just beat the world speed record.

992
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,195
Whose?

993
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:03,826
Making love, you know,
isn't the same thing as a 50-yard dash.

994
01:34:04,972 --> 01:34:07,338
Well, what do you mean by that?

995
01:34:18,853 --> 01:34:20,377
How ya doin'?

996
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:35,899
Never screwed on grass before?

997
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:42,500
That was....

998
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:49,610
Outrageous?

999
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:51,643
Outrageous.

1000
01:34:54,922 --> 01:34:58,756
Out. Way out.

1001
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:04,287
-Can I join you two?
-He's all yours.

1002
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:05,958
Fair enough.

1003
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:07,660
I'll buy that.

1004
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:12,771
-No preliminaries?
-I don't need no preliminaries.

1005
01:35:17,178 --> 01:35:19,442
-Get your clothes on.
-I'm not going anywhere.

1006
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:22,710
-We're cuttin' out with this bag of goodies.
-That's a dirty trick.

1007
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:24,478
Why should those pricks have it?

1008
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:27,385
I mean Ronnie and Gail,
leaving them here with those guys.

1009
01:35:27,455 --> 01:35:29,980
They're big girls,
they can take care of themselves.

1010
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:36,195
I want to see you again.
I wanna get together again.

1011
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:37,423
No.

1012
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:38,694
No?

1013
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:43,767
You liked it. I could tell you liked it.
Didn't you like it?

1014
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:45,405
It was okay.

1015
01:35:46,707 --> 01:35:48,971
-So I'll see you again.
-No.

1016
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,512
Listen, when something happens once,
it doesn't mean it has to happen again.

1017
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:00,817
Then that's just a one-night stand.

1018
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:04,390
Come on,
you've had one-night stands before.

1019
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:09,123
Yeah, but I decided.

1020
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:15,161
Wait a minute.

1021
01:36:17,371 --> 01:36:19,771
No, man, no. That's too much.

1022
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,070
Just the credit cards, man.

1023
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:24,907
-You're askin' for the pigs.
-Sell 'em.

1024
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:28,180
What about a weekend?

1025
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:32,584
Maybe, but I don't really think so.

1026
01:36:38,225 --> 01:36:41,058
Is that your way of saying no?

1027
01:36:41,695 --> 01:36:42,684
I guess so.

1028
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:53,936
Compton! Christ!

1029
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:06,645
-Little pricks stole our wallets.
-Our wallets?

1030
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,484
Yeah, the drugs, too. I'm gonna get 'em.

1031
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:12,989
Get your pants on.

1032
01:37:13,227 --> 01:37:17,459
Where are they? Where'd your friends go?
Come on. I said, "Where are they?"

1033
01:37:17,531 --> 01:37:21,524
Come on, where'd they go, bitch?
Tell me, come on, where did they go?

1034
01:37:21,602 --> 01:37:25,197
You're gonna tell me, or I'm gonna
beat the shit out of you, come on!

1035
01:37:25,272 --> 01:37:26,967
Look, we don't know.

1036
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:28,406
The hell you don't.

1037
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:33,513
Come on, bitch, come on, whore.
Come on, talk.

1038
01:37:33,814 --> 01:37:34,974
Will you stop him?

1039
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:38,280
What are you protecting them for?
They didn't give a damn about you.

1040
01:37:38,586 --> 01:37:41,453
Come on, bitch, want me to hurt you now?

1041
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:44,587
They've got a commune in the country.

1042
01:37:44,658 --> 01:37:46,888
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

1043
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:51,789
Tell me!

1044
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:59,203
Up Route 9, take it to the18...

1045
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:03,407
...about 5 miles on Edgewood Road.

1046
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:05,809
-If you're lying, I'll be back.
-I'm not lying.

1047
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,849
I can finish what I started. Got that?

1048
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:11,851
You just balled me, you don't believe me?

1049
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,344
Wait a minute, Compton.

1050
01:39:55,956 --> 01:39:57,947
Joe, put them back.

1051
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:00,556
Just give 'em a little scare.

1052
01:40:00,627 --> 01:40:02,356
-No.
-Shake 'em up.

1053
01:40:48,842 --> 01:40:52,334
-Maybe you wanna give us back our stuff?
-Yeah, sure.

1054
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:58,611
You got it all?

1055
01:41:06,994 --> 01:41:08,757
Where's the money?

1056
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:20,873
Oh, my God.

1057
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:33,319
What the hell you doin', Compton?

1058
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:48,564
God, no, don't shoot me. I won't tell.

1059
01:41:48,635 --> 01:41:51,468
Don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me.

1060
01:41:51,538 --> 01:41:53,836
Please. I won't tell.

1061
01:41:55,209 --> 01:41:58,076
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?

1062
01:41:58,979 --> 01:42:01,880
-I won't tell anybody. Please.
-Where's that gonna get you?

1063
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,883
You wanna shoot somebody, shoot them.

1064
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:05,708
Please, don't.

1065
01:42:08,222 --> 01:42:12,215
There's only one way out now: clean.

1066
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:14,226
That means everybody.

1067
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:19,891
-At this point, it can get to be fun.
-No more.

1068
01:42:21,068 --> 01:42:24,629
I don't get you, Compton.
You hate those kids.

1069
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:27,534
You hate the way those girls
put you down...

1070
01:42:27,608 --> 01:42:29,974
...the way those kids,
those little shitheads...

1071
01:42:30,043 --> 01:42:33,342
...they made a shithead out of you,
guys like Frank...

1072
01:42:33,413 --> 01:42:35,244
...what Frank did to your daughter.

1073
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:39,346
No!

1074
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:45,990
Look, Compton, you told me
you got a kick out of killing Frank.

1075
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:50,626
These kids, they shit on you,
they shit on your life.

1076
01:42:51,265 --> 01:42:54,928
They shit on everything you believe in.
They shit on everything!

1077
01:42:55,969 --> 01:42:58,437
You hate 'em as much as I do.

1078
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:03,732
No!

1079
01:43:06,446 --> 01:43:11,383
It's your ass now, Compton!

1080
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:25,029
These kids, they shit on you,
shit on your life.

1081
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:27,726
They shit on everything you believe in,
on everything.

1082
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:30,564
You wanna shoot somebody, shoot them.

1083
01:43:30,637 --> 01:43:32,662
Are you gonna kill me, too?

1084
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:34,238
Melissa!
