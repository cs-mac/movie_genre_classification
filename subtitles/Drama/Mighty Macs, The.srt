16
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:38,855

17
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:41,856

-She's in bed, l think.

30

Do you know
where the headquarters of Cybernet is?

31
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,289
Cybernet? Yeah. Why?

-You know Richard Reid?
-Yeah.

33
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:25,889

Adam?

lt's not a problem.

-Thank you.
-No problem.

51
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:37,855
All right, l gotta roll. l love you.

52
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,050
-l'll call you. Leave your phone on.
-Okay.

53
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:47,649
l'll see you at the supermarket, okay?

54
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:48,972
Take care of her.

55
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:52,971
-Do you have a boy?
-l have a daughter, one, sir.

56
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:56,295
-How old?
-Maybe eight and a half months.

57
00:04:56,418 --> 00:05:00,297
Daughter good. No problem. Life.

58
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:03,057
-Boy too much problem, life.
-Yeah.

59
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:07,014
Danny. Kaleem Yusuf.

60
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:08,617
-Danny Pearl.
-Nice to meet you.

61
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:11,457
Please, come through.
Would you care for some tea?

62
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,373
l want to ask your advice
about something.

63
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:18,332
l'm supposed to meet tonight
with Sheikh Gilani.

64
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,370
-Where are you supposed to meet him?
-At the Village Restaurant.

65
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:26,811
Provided you meet him at a public place
you should be all right.

66
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:29,406
-Just be careful.
-Okay, l will.

67
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,812
Good.

68
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:47,973
lt's not just religious fundamentalism
that we are fighting.

69
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,376
lt's a combination of tribalism,
retrogressive cultural values

70
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,456
and a totally decayed
criminal justice system.

71
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:58,536
So what is your focus, your solution?

72
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:02,617
-Tonight you go?
-Tomorrow, yeah.

73
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:03,966
Why, my friend?

74
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,692
-You know Dubai?
-l know, sir, Dubai.

75
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:09,571
-Have you been there?
-No, no. Only Karachi.

76
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:18,134
So l'm trying to find someone
who's using Cybernet as his lSP.

77
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:21,170
l have the e-mail account name

78
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,335
and l was wondering if you'd
be able to give me the lP number

79
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,335
or the name of the account holder?

80
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:30,053
lt is possible but l guess everything
here is very confidential

81
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:34,171
and we are not supposed to leak
any sort of information to anybody.

82
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,692
Asra? Yeah, l'll be there in 10 minutes.

83
00:06:47,738 --> 00:06:48,727
<i>Masud.</i>

84
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,610
Danny. How are you?
ls everything okay?

85
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:53,127
Yeah. No, l'm all right,
l'm on my way now.

86
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:54,896
Okay. ls Mariane going with you?

87
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:58,090
-No, she's not. She's gonna stay home.
-<i>No? That's</i> g<i>ood.</i>

88
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,971
-Why? ls there a problem?
-No, no, there's no problem.

89
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:03,487
As long as you meet in public,
there shouldn't be a problem.

90
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:06,291
All right.
l mean, it's what everybody tells me.

91
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,012
Yeah, because that's true.
Good luck for the meeting.

92
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,651
Yeah, thanks.

93
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:25,656

At least l can say ''water''
as opposed to ''water.''

118
00:09:56,738 --> 00:10:00,208
No-one says ''water'' here. Okay?
We all say ''water.''

-How do you mean?

124

All the American journalists
are ClA agents, aren't they?

125
00:10:17,978 --> 00:10:19,093
Sure.

126
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,732
l work for the <i>WaII Street JournaI,</i>
so does that make me a ClA agent?

127
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:24,816
But what do the Americans
really know about Pakistan?

128

What do they know about Afghanistan?

129

Apart from bombing it all the time.

130
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:30,090
That's why l'm a journalist,
to let people know.

-That's a romantic idea of journalism.
-l don't think so.

132
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:35,252
Read the papers here,
you'll be definitely more cynical.

No, he would call me.

Okay.

154
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:47,815
l found the e-mails
setting up Danny's meeting with Gilani.

155
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:53,968

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

Okay. Where was it?

161
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:12,048
No, this line is disconnected as well.
lt's not working.

162
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,693
That e-mail address, ''Nobadmashi.''

163
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:21,254
ln Urdu it means, like, ''no wrongdoing.''

164
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:23,972
lt's a weird e-mail address.

165
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:26,976
The brother's number is bullshit
and Siddique's number is bullshit.

166
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:28,497
lt's bullshit.

167
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:49,376
''Jamaat Ul-Fuqra.''

177
00:13:14,538 --> 00:13:19,817
No, Sheikh Gilani is a peaceful man.
He's always upset when people die.

178
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:22,532
So he was upset that
the World Trade Centers were bombed?

179
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:24,967
Yes, because many of his followers
are American.

180
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:27,487
Do you know who's behind the attack
on the World Trade Center?

-Who?
-The Jews.

Mossad are the only ones who
could have organised such an event.

00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:24,771
Look, Asra and l are your best ally.

300
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:29,767
Right? We are both journalists
and we should work together.

301
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:34,212
l would not like
to have it any other way, Mrs Pearl.

302
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:37,011
l need your support. l need your help.

303
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:40,448
-We have Danny's computer.
-Okay. Could l see it?

304
00:20:40,578 --> 00:20:42,216
l'll go and get it.

305
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:43,930
Who took him to the restaurant?

306
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:46,214
Did you get the taxi for Daniel Pearl?

307
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:48,533
-Yes, sir.
-Where did you get the taxi from?

308
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:51,328
Sir, from Two Swords.

309
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:54,413
Get out.

310
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:57,611
What's your name?

311
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:01,657
Hello, son.

312
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:02,893
What's your name?

313
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:05,407
-Harris, sir.
-Harris?

314
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:10,132
-What's that?
-Can you translate that?

315
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,055
We'll find your Danny.

316
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:17,411
You must take care of yourself
and the baby.

317
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,528
-You didn't see anyone at 7 pm?
-No.

318
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,569
There was no foreigner here yesterday?

319
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:32,929
Yesterday evening,
did you see a foreigner here?

320
00:21:33,578 --> 00:21:34,533
No, sir.

321
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:41,248
<i>The AI Qaeda suspects, seen on</i>

00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:21,329
l'm really sorry about Danny.

326
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,608
-Have you heard any news?
-No.

327
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:25,933
Can you tell us what you know?

328
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:27,855
Danny wanted to meet Gilani.

329
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:31,857
He went with Arif.
And we spoke with Bashir...

330
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:34,538
-And who's Arif?
-l don't know.

331
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:37,335
What do you mean you don't know?
How did you meet him?

332
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:41,531
-l got his number from a friend of mine.
-Okay, so who's the friend?

333
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:44,092
-l can't tell you.
-You can't tell us? Why is that?

334
00:22:44,218 --> 00:22:45,537
ls that because
they paid you for Danny?

335
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:47,296
How much did they pay you for Danny?

336
00:22:47,418 --> 00:22:49,852
l was doing my job, helping Danny.

337
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:52,538
l don't think you understand
how serious this is.

338
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:56,412
We need that name to find Danny.
Danny is missing.

339
00:22:57,698 --> 00:23:01,486
He may be able to help me find him.
Okay? l need the name.

340
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:04,176
l promised him not to give his name.

341
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:06,175
Do you understand that maybe

342
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:10,496
you can make the difference
of helping Danny or nobody finds him?

343
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:14,856
Maybe nobody finds him because
you won't give the fucking name!

344
00:23:21,018 --> 00:23:22,007
Yeah, hello?

345
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:24,015
Hello, Paracha, this is Masud.

346
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:27,178
<i>I'm with Mariane PearI.</i>
<i>They want to taIk to you.</i>

347
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:29,289
You gave them my name?

348
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:33,049
Hello? Can you tell me anything
that you know about Arif?

349
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:37,137
l met Arif at Harkut-ul-Mujahideen.
He's just a Jihadi.

350
00:23:37,258 --> 00:23:38,657
<i>But what's his fuII name?</i>

351
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:41,611
l don't know. l don't know
anything about him personally.

352
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:44,411
A few weeks ago
they were having this organisation legal

353
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:46,176
but now they've all gone underground.

354
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:47,617
Okay, look,
l don't need a political speech.

355
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:50,206
Can you just give me some information?

356
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:02,011
He had short hair, skinny
and was wearing glasses.

357
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:04,857
We found one person.

358
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:09,887
l told Danny
not to contact Bashir directly.

359
00:24:10,018 --> 00:24:12,612
-Can you describe Bashir for us?
-l can try.

360
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:16,732
-What is your name?
-Aqeel Nawaz.

361
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:35,891
We've brought you something.
lt was the best we could find in Karachi.

362
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:43,934
l'm Randall Bennett.

363
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:46,806
-lt's nice to meet you at last.
-Nice to meet you.

364
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:48,769
-This is Philippe Scaerou.
-Hello.

365
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:52,129
And Veronique Laurent
from the French Embassy.

366
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:55,935
And from the FBl
we have Maureen Platt...

367
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:58,014
Mrs Pearl, we're gonna need
to look at Daniel's computer.

368
00:24:58,138 --> 00:25:00,891
These gentlemen
need to copy the hard drive.

369
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:03,613
Hello.

370
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:05,535
lf you need anything, don't hesitate.

371
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:07,890
Goodbye, Mariane, be brave.

372
00:25:09,978 --> 00:25:11,855
-How are you?
-Captain.

373
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,730
l haven't been introduced
to this gentleman here.

374
00:25:13,858 --> 00:25:15,257
Javed Habib, Chief of ClD.

375
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:17,767
He's leading the investigation
on the Pakistani side.

376
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:19,013
lnteresting. Thank you.

377
00:25:19,138 --> 00:25:21,333
-Agent Platt.
-Excuse me.

378
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:24,253
We have been discussing

379
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:27,370
how important it is
that everybody shares information.

380
00:25:27,498 --> 00:25:28,692
-Of course.
-Bennett.

381
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,171
-Yes?
-lt's kind of a private call.

382
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,892
Do you think
you can you clear the room?

383
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:37,494
All right. Come on, gentlemen. Today.
Let's go. Let's move it out.

384
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,329
Thank you, gentlemen.

385
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,449
This is for you.

386
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:45,854
lt's as much
as l could get together in 24 hours.

387
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:46,933
There's a lot about Gilani

388
00:25:47,058 --> 00:25:49,572
and some other people
that are beginning to appear.

389
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:52,053
Why have we not heard
from the kidnappers?

390
00:25:52,178 --> 00:25:56,137
Well, they're gonna wanna get Danny to
a safe place before they make contact.

391
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:58,169
And we've got
the police doing everything they can

392
00:25:58,298 --> 00:25:59,856
to make it difficult.

393
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:03,653
l want you to know that they consider
Danny a high-value hostage

394
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:06,246
and they'll wanna keep him alive.

395
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:10,131
Gilani.

396
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:16,737
Akbar.

397
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:19,532
Reid going to Boston.

398
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:22,328
And then we tally the number.

399
00:26:33,298 --> 00:26:35,573
So now we have one piece of news.

400
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:39,088
-Finally we have found the taxi driver.
-What did he say?

401
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:41,732
<i>He took Danny</i>
<i>to the ViIIa</i>g<i>e Restaurant for 7:00.</i>

402
00:26:41,858 --> 00:26:45,976
<i>Danny received a phone caII</i>
<i>and then he toId taxi driver he couId</i> g<i>o.</i>

403
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:48,771
l'm gonna let you go, okay? Thank you.

404
00:26:54,138 --> 00:26:55,696
Yeah, but do we believe that story?

405
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:57,934
Waiters at the restaurant
corroborate his story.

406
00:26:58,058 --> 00:26:59,207
Okay. Right.

407
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:01,647
And no luck so far with Gilani.

408
00:27:01,778 --> 00:27:03,814
-Or Bashir or Siddique?
-No.

409
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:05,894
And what about Masud?
What's happening with him?

410
00:27:06,018 --> 00:27:07,007
He's here.

411
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:09,129
We are sending him back
to lslamabad tonight.

412
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:10,816
He has to look for Arif.

413
00:27:10,938 --> 00:27:14,453
He's here with his brother-in-law,
who's a journalist.

414
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:15,727
He's a journalist? He's here?

415
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:18,452
He works for <i>Takbeer.</i>
A Jihadi newspaper. Very anti-US.

416
00:27:18,578 --> 00:27:20,808
-What? Where is he?
-He's outside.

417
00:27:24,858 --> 00:27:26,132
What is this? Who are these people?

418
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:27,532
Why are you bringing them
to my house?

419
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:30,126
-Why is there a journalist in my home?
-This guy is torturing me.

420
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:32,214
He's a torturer.
He's going to go with me to lslamabad.

421
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,215
-What is this?
-Help me.

422
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:35,407
lt's not true. lt's not true at all.

423
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:37,972
You need to find Arif
and you need to find Bashir.

424
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:40,054
And don't bring people to my house
that don't like Americans.

425
00:27:40,178 --> 00:27:41,167
Danny's American.

426
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:43,448
-And don't write shit.
-Sorry for that.

427
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,648
Come on, get them in the car.

428
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:46,813
Go on, move it.

429
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:48,735
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

430
00:27:48,858 --> 00:27:50,450
We're conducting
a proper investigation.

431
00:27:54,778 --> 00:27:56,257
How long have you been here?

432
00:27:56,378 --> 00:27:57,652
One year, sir.

433
00:27:58,338 --> 00:27:59,737
How many children do you have?

434
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:00,813
Sir, only one child.

435
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:02,610
-Only one?
-Yes.

436
00:28:10,818 --> 00:28:14,174
No, but just tell me.
That's what l'm saying.

437
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:19,129
The lSl came to my parents and asked,
where did this girl come from?

438
00:28:19,258 --> 00:28:20,532
From lndia?

439
00:28:20,738 --> 00:28:22,933
l understand but you know
l'm not involved in any of that.

440
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:24,411
l know that but...

441
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:31,567
He won't come back.
His family will never let him come back.

442
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:34,737
Some lntelligence guys
went over to his house,

443
00:28:34,858 --> 00:28:37,326
said l was some kind of an lndian spy

444
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:41,976
and that they'd make a big scandal
for his family.

445
00:28:42,098 --> 00:28:44,054
He's afraid of his family?

446
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:14,291
Connect those lines.

447
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,933
Mariane. Hi.

448
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:37,688
-How are you?
-l'm all right.

449
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,048
-Any news? No.
-No.

450
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,930
How was the honeymoon?

451
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:43,969
lt was good, yeah. lt was good.

452
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:48,728
l brought loads of stuff,
a computer, printer, phones.

453
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:52,129
How many lines are you getting us?

454
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:53,213
Six lines.

455
00:29:53,338 --> 00:29:54,453
Where are they coming from?

456
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:55,806
We're cutting off
the neighbours' phone lines.

457
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:56,927
What will happen to their phones?

458
00:29:57,058 --> 00:29:58,855
They'll have to use yours.

459
00:29:59,178 --> 00:30:01,248
Hasan, this is Steve.

460
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:02,493
Hello.

461
00:30:03,618 --> 00:30:04,607
You speak Urdu?

462
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:06,456
Steve and Danny
worked together in lslamabad.

463
00:30:06,578 --> 00:30:09,012
Okay. You knew Mr Pearl?

464
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:13,336
So, they still need to find Arif,
the go-between,

465
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:15,289
Bashir in Rawalpindi,

466
00:30:15,418 --> 00:30:20,367
lmtiaz Siddique here in Karachi
and Gilani, wherever he is.

467
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:21,817
And Danny.

468
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:24,450
And Danny.

469
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:30,246
Check everybody's lD
before you let them through.

470
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:41,656
My mother is here and she wants me to
marry someone who l really don't know.

471
00:30:41,778 --> 00:30:45,487
-What, like an arranged marriage?
-lt is, 100%.

472
00:30:46,818 --> 00:30:49,093
Have you seen this article
from <i>The Independent?</i>

473
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,447
What's that?

474
00:30:50,578 --> 00:30:52,409
The <i>JournaI's</i> bureau in London
sent it through.

475
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:55,928
lt's about a British Pakistani,
Omar Saeed Sheikh.

476
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:59,767
lt claims that he wired $100,000
to Mohammed Atta just before 9/1 1 .

477
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:01,695
How does that connect to Danny?

478
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,137
Well, he's based in Rawalpindi

479
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:06,455
and he specialises
in kidnapping Westerners.

480
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:08,330
-Can l see it?
-Yeah.

481
00:31:09,218 --> 00:31:12,733
-Do you know him?
-l know him only by reputation.

482
00:31:14,658 --> 00:31:16,535
-Hello.
-<i>It's John Bussey.</i>

483
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:18,888
Let me talk to Mariane, please.

484
00:31:20,658 --> 00:31:21,647
Hello?

485
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:25,771
-Hey, Mariane. lt's John. How are you?
-<i>HeIIo.</i>

486
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:27,047
l need you to come here.

487
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:31,217
l'm thinking maybe the best thing
for me to do is to go to lslamabad first.

488
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:32,771
No, no, to Karachi.

489
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:34,490
<i>To make the dipIomatic rounds with us.</i>

490
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:36,336
Okay. No, that makes sense to me.

491
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,688
-Soon, yeah?
-Yeah, very soon. Very, very soon.

492
00:31:38,818 --> 00:31:40,251
-All right.
-We pretty much can write him off.

493
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:45,531
Captain, can l talk to you?

494
00:31:50,938 --> 00:31:54,214
Danny is not a religious man. But...

495
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:57,458
But he's Jewish, by birth.

496
00:31:59,498 --> 00:32:00,692
Okay.

497
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:03,609
Who else knows this?

498
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:06,929
He didn't advertise it

499
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,334
but he would never deny
if somebody asked him.

500
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,247
Okay.

501
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,175
But don't tell anybody.

502
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:19,577
l won't.

503
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:35,734
-Look at this.
-What does it say?

504
00:32:35,858 --> 00:32:38,736
lt says Danny is suspected
of being a Mossad agent

505
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:41,816
and of having relations
with lndia's lntelligence Agency.

506
00:32:41,938 --> 00:32:43,451
Give it to me.

507
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:48,654
-Who was it l gave that picture to?
-Military lntelligence.

508
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:51,053
They think he's Mossad,
they're going to kill him.

509
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,009
What is everybody doing?

510
00:32:53,698 --> 00:32:55,973
What the fuck is everybody doing?

511
00:33:26,978 --> 00:33:28,491
Very silly.

512
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:37,853
ls this the address?

513
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:39,093
Hello?

514
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,374
Yeah. Yeah, l got it.

515
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:45,249
Okay, yeah, l've got it.
l've got it. Thanks.

516
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:48,370
-What?
-There's an e-mail from the kidnappers.

517
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:54,770
''The National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistan Sovereignty

518
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:57,970
''has captured ClA officer Daniel Pearl

519
00:33:58,098 --> 00:34:01,215
''who has been posing as a journalist
of the <i>WaII Street JournaI.</i>

520
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:05,377
''Unfortunately he is at present being
kept in very inhuman circumstances

521
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:06,851
''quite similar, in fact, to the way

522
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,934
''that Pakistanis and nationals
of other sovereign countries

523
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:11,447
''have been kept in Cuba
by the American Army.

524
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:13,853
''lf the Americans keep our countrymen
in better conditions

525
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:15,809
''we will better
the conditions of Mr Pearl

526
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:18,611
''and all other Americans
that we capture.''

527
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:22,854
Jang claims he's Mossad
and now they're claiming he's ClA.

528
00:34:24,618 --> 00:34:27,086
These things they do to shock you.

529
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:31,053
They're asking
for the release of jet plane.

530
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:39,736
-Hello. Captain.
-Randall.

531
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:42,418
l need the original e-mail
so we can see the header.

532
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,573
Well, this is a copy.

533
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:45,370
The original
was sent to the <i>Washin</i>g<i>ton Post.</i>

534
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:48,649
-l need the original.
-Here are the photographs.

535
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:50,370
-This is all of them right here?
-Okay.

536
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:52,966
This is the only document that came?

537
00:34:53,818 --> 00:34:56,127
-When did you get this?
-Half an hour ago.

538
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:05,848
Can we get someone to figure out
what kind of camera this was?

539
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,093
Yeah, but it wasn't sent to the <i>JournaI.</i>

540
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:09,652
-Are these Danny's clothes?
-No.

541
00:35:11,218 --> 00:35:13,971
-Can you print this out for me please?
-This photo doesn't look real.

542
00:35:14,098 --> 00:35:16,566
l think that's a doctored photo.
l don't think this is Danny.

543
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:17,687
Look at this,

544
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:20,855
you compare the dimensions here
with the dimensions here.

545
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:22,536
That's Danny.

546
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:28,251
-Let's send it off to the lab anyway.
-Do what you wish.

547
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:29,777
Dost, can you get on this right away?

548
00:35:29,898 --> 00:35:32,617
We're gonna
have to get this to Washington.

549
00:35:35,978 --> 00:35:37,127
-Hello?
-<i>Mariane.</i>

550
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:40,773
lt's his mother.
lt's Danny's mother. Hello.

551
00:35:40,898 --> 00:35:42,013
Have you seen them?

552
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:43,537
-The photos of Danny.
-<i>Yes.</i>

553
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:45,728
-lt's good news, Mariane.
-Yes.

554
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:48,053
<i>It means Danny is aIive.</i>

555
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:50,134
Yes, of course he's alive. Yes.

556
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:53,648
The people here,
they don't think it's real.

557
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:54,847
<i>They don't think they're reaIIy Danny.</i>

558
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:57,651
Of course they are.
l recognise his hands.

559
00:35:58,298 --> 00:36:00,892
Listen, they're going to release him,
okay?

560
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:03,930
l mean,
no one would ever want to hurt Danny.

561
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:15,009
You see that?

562
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:16,651
He's smiling.

563
00:36:17,618 --> 00:36:22,009
He has a gun to his head and he's
smiling and he's telling me he's okay.

564
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:26,893
Yeah.

565
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,168
He says ''fuck you'' to them.

566
00:36:33,418 --> 00:36:35,693
She'll be fine. She'll be fine.

567
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:45,336
l appreciate how difficult this meeting
is gonna be for you, Mrs Pearl.

568
00:36:45,498 --> 00:36:48,649
We need the Minister to authorise
a national force to look for Danny.

569
00:36:49,658 --> 00:36:53,617
Just because he was taken in Karachi
doesn't mean he's still here.

570
00:37:00,058 --> 00:37:02,128
Minister. Good to meet you.

571
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:03,771
-This is Mariane Pearl.
-How do you do?

572
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:05,251
Thank you for meeting with us.

573
00:37:05,378 --> 00:37:07,209
Mrs Pearl, let me tell you something.

574
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:12,566
There were 3,000 journalists in
Pakistan during the war in Afghanistan.

575
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:15,206
Not one of them got into trouble.

576
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:16,737
Danny and l
were two of those journalists,

577
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:19,133
so l'm sorry,
l don't understand your point.

578
00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:20,976
Why did your husband
have to meet with these people?

579
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:22,690
He's a journalist.

580
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:24,968
l don't think this is the business
of a journalist.

581
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:26,292
Forgive me for correcting you,

582
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:28,978
but it is absolutely
the business of a journalist.

583
00:37:29,098 --> 00:37:30,895
-Mrs Pearl.
-Yes?

584
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:32,497
We do have information

585
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,530
that the lndian lntelligence Services
are behind this kidnapping.

586
00:37:35,658 --> 00:37:37,091
You really believe that? l don't think...

587
00:37:37,218 --> 00:37:39,971
They are trying to embarrass Pakistan

588
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:43,568
by blaming lslamic extremists or the lSl

589
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:47,213
for the disappearance of an
American journalist. Don't you see it?

590
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:49,613
l think we must conclude at this point.

591
00:37:49,738 --> 00:37:53,731
Mr Bauman, l am slightly busy
and l do have some prior engagements.

592
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:55,894
Thank you. Mr Bauman.

593
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:58,734
-Mrs Pearl.
-Thank you.

594
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:01,008
-Thanks.
-Thank you, Mr Bauman.

595
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,652
Have you seen this person?

596
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:11,131
l'm looking for somebody who
stayed here called Chaudhry Bashir.

597
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:12,327
Here is his number.

598
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:23,213
How long do we have to stay here?

599
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:24,657
Until we find him.

600
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:33,287
l'm sorry l was unable to come sooner.
l've been away.

601
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:39,732
But l have here a list of all the calls
that Danny made from the 19th.

602
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:42,094
Didn't you meet with Danny
the day that he was kidnapped?

603
00:38:42,218 --> 00:38:46,416
That's right. Danny told me
he was meeting with Gilani.

604
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:50,247
ln fact, while he was with me,
he received two phone calls.

605
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:52,007
Right.

606
00:38:53,538 --> 00:38:55,449
Right, l'll be there.

607
00:38:56,298 --> 00:38:58,493
We work with telephone numbers.

608
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:02,088
We start with Danny's number
and Arif's,

609
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:04,049
lmtiaz Siddique's and Bashir's.

610
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,567
From these numbers
we find their contacts

611
00:39:06,698 --> 00:39:09,656
and then we obtain the numbers
that they called and so on

612
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:13,851
until we find the kidnappers.
This is our business.

613
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:16,970
And let me assure you,
we know what we're doing.

614
00:39:17,098 --> 00:39:21,091
They're sourcing the lP
from Bashir's e-mail, right?

615
00:39:21,218 --> 00:39:22,537
That's what they're trying to do.

616
00:39:22,658 --> 00:39:24,967
-And no luck so far?
-No.

617
00:39:43,938 --> 00:39:46,930

Excuse me, sorry.

624
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:09,413
Are you sure this is the right way?
This is the right way?

625
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:10,687
Yes, sir.

626
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:13,256
Do you have a map?

627
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,416
No. Sorry.

628
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:39,415
The scene outside the house
is out of control.

629
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:43,613
-We have to respond.
-l think you should handle most of it.

630
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:46,206
Great. We've gotten hundreds
and hundreds of requests.

631
00:40:46,338 --> 00:40:49,455
You have an authority that
nobody else has to say who Danny is.

632
00:40:49,578 --> 00:40:51,375
And they've already said
that he's Mossad.

633
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:52,851
They've already said he's ClA.

634
00:40:52,978 --> 00:40:58,735
By not responding we're tacitly allowing
these things to go unchallenged.

635
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:00,974
We also have been talking
to Colin Powell.

636
00:41:01,098 --> 00:41:04,135
Colin Powell has been talking
to President Musharraf.

637
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:06,249
-Asking him to do what?
-We also got a...

638
00:41:06,378 --> 00:41:09,097
l'm sorry.
We've also issued a statement

639
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:11,368
saying that Danny
did not work for the Government,

640
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:12,931
that Danny did not work for the ClA.

641
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:17,574
The ClA has then agreed
to issue a statement confirming that.

642
00:41:17,698 --> 00:41:19,973
-They're gonna confirm that publicly?
-Yeah.

643
00:41:20,098 --> 00:41:21,087
-The ClA?
-Yeah.

644
00:41:21,218 --> 00:41:25,689
We're doing everything we possibly
can do to make sure that Danny is safe.

645
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,734
Okay, we're on our way.

646
00:41:29,298 --> 00:41:31,607
Masud, where's the coach station
for Muzaffarabad?

647
00:41:31,738 --> 00:41:32,853
ls Arif going to Muzaffarabad?

648
00:41:32,978 --> 00:41:34,696
From Pirwadhi Bus Station?

649
00:41:45,178 --> 00:41:46,372
ls Arif here?

650
00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:15,054
Seventy-three numbers have now been
recognised as possible suspects.

651
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:18,295
Our analysis
is beginning to yield results.

652
00:42:18,418 --> 00:42:22,127
One of the numbers that Bashir called
is a land line in Lahore.

653
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:25,375
And that land line
belongs to a Sony TV dealer.

654
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,493
And the Sony TV dealer was frequently
calling another man in Karachi.

655
00:42:37,738 --> 00:42:41,128
And this person was frequently calling
another man in Punjab.

656
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:49,054
Where is Hashim's house?

657
00:42:51,378 --> 00:42:52,891
Where is Hashim's house?

658
00:42:57,898 --> 00:42:59,411
Where is Hashim?

659
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:00,732
We want to search the house.

660
00:43:00,858 --> 00:43:01,847
Why are you all coming in here?

661
00:43:02,018 --> 00:43:06,648
Now, the important thing is,
Hashim also goes by the name of Arif.

662
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,527
-Arif?
-That's great.

663
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:13,697
-We have a photograph of Arif.
-You found Arif? Great.

664
00:43:16,618 --> 00:43:19,769
But his family
claims he died in Afghanistan.

665
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:21,691
What?

666
00:43:21,818 --> 00:43:23,217
He told Danny he was going to Kashmir.

667
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:24,327
Exactly.

668
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:26,767
-Well, is there a body?
-No. There's no body.

669
00:43:26,898 --> 00:43:29,412
We do not believe
he's necessarily dead.

670
00:43:29,538 --> 00:43:32,575
His group
has a lot of fighters in Kashmir.

671
00:43:32,698 --> 00:43:36,088
We think
he may have gone to Muzaffarabad.

672
00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:45,656
-Hello.
-<i>Hey, Asra. It's John Bussey.</i>

Yes, l have a message.

677
00:44:21,698 --> 00:44:23,973
l have three different points
l wanna talk about.

678
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:25,895
Mariane, how's it going in there?

679
00:44:26,018 --> 00:44:28,612
-Good. l'm coming.
-Okay.

680
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:35,212
-Okay. You look great.
-Thanks.

681
00:44:36,178 --> 00:44:37,691
One moment.

682
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,210
That's good, that's great.

683
00:44:45,338 --> 00:44:47,488
-Asra, come on. We should go.
-Yeah.

684
00:44:48,698 --> 00:44:50,529
lt's Danny's.

685
00:44:53,298 --> 00:44:55,175
Okay, let's go.

686
00:45:00,058 --> 00:45:01,571
That's perfect.

687
00:45:02,738 --> 00:45:06,333
Jesus Christ.
Come on, you guys, let's go. Come on.

688
00:45:07,698 --> 00:45:08,892
Come on, help us push.

689
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:12,214
Watch your toes, John.

690
00:45:13,258 --> 00:45:15,977
Yeah, we'll give you a holler, you get in.

691
00:45:18,378 --> 00:45:20,175
There we go.

692
00:45:25,298 --> 00:45:26,572
One question?

693
00:45:34,538 --> 00:45:37,006
You know, emphasise the baby.

694
00:45:37,138 --> 00:45:40,972
Emphasise the fact that you and Danny
are both journalists working here.

695
00:45:41,098 --> 00:45:42,053
Okay.

696
00:45:42,178 --> 00:45:45,887
-Bussey, she's fine. Just relax.
-Okay.

697

703
00:46:13,098 --> 00:46:16,295
<i>The first one</i>

704
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:18,534
<i>that my husband and I</i>
<i>are both journaIists.</i>

705

<i>We are two peopIe who met</i>

706

707
00:46:24,178 --> 00:46:25,816
<i>He's someone who...</i>

708
00:46:26,378 --> 00:46:28,892
<i>I never saw him say a Iie.</i>

709
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:32,693
<i>In his journaIism,</i>
<i>I've never seen anyone so honest.</i>

710
00:46:33,298 --> 00:46:36,051
<i>And how are you copin</i>g <i>with this?</i>

711
00:46:39,218 --> 00:46:42,767

-Great, Holly.
-Thank you, John. l'll ring you.

723
00:47:18,858 --> 00:47:21,975
l like the fact
that you held yourself together.

724
00:47:22,098 --> 00:47:26,011
You wouldn't know her husband
has been kidnapped for six days.

725
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:41,767
We gotta figure out a way
to get Mariane to eat more.

726
00:47:41,898 --> 00:47:43,775
l think it's important for her.
For her health.

727
00:47:43,898 --> 00:47:46,571
She's a pregnant woman,
she's gotta feed this baby.

728
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,450
Just so you know,
l'm not a very good cook.

729
00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:50,967
You know, maybe it's a matter
of if we're all eating together.

what we wanna know.

754
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:22,296
l'd like a front-row seat

755
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:26,206
when they hang them up by their feet
and beat them with sticks.

756
00:49:32,658 --> 00:49:34,535
Right, goodnight.

757
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:37,809
And we'll see you,
you stay all night, yeah?

758
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:39,894
You stay? Yeah? All night?

759
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:28,568
Put here, please. Thank you.

760
00:50:30,018 --> 00:50:32,168
-So we have a chef?
-Yes.

761
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:36,936
John got him from Mr Bauman.
He normally works at the US Consulate.

762
00:50:39,058 --> 00:50:41,652
''Baffling questions
about lndian lady in Pearl case.''

763
00:50:41,778 --> 00:50:43,336
That is the perfect word for Asra.

764
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:46,336
''Security agencies
are probing several baffling questions

765
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:49,928
''pertaining to the lndian Muslim lady,
Asra Q. Nomani.''

766
00:50:50,058 --> 00:50:51,173
ls there a photo of me there?

767
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,970
''Miss Nomani is staying at a house
in Karachi

768
00:50:53,098 --> 00:50:56,090
''that the latter
got on a monthly rental of Rs. 40,000.''

769
00:50:56,218 --> 00:50:58,129
They're putting
how much rent l'm paying?

770
00:50:58,258 --> 00:50:59,771
-Rs. 40,000?
-Yeah.

771
00:50:59,898 --> 00:51:02,890
''As her address in lndia,
with her phone number 91-223...''

772
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,895
-What?
-lt has my address?

773
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:06,610
How can they get
that kind of information?

774
00:51:06,738 --> 00:51:07,773
lt's obvious.

775
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,970
Security agencies. Who else?
That's their job, they're doing their job.

776
00:51:11,098 --> 00:51:14,135
-You better change your phone number.
-lt's a Pakistan and lndia thing.

777
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:23,410
What do you think of this, Shabir?

778
00:51:25,698 --> 00:51:29,452
He is saying God is raining.
God is coming down with the rain.

779
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:43,373
This is the main attraction.

780
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:46,012
-You want me to carve it?
-l believe you're good with a knife.

781
00:51:46,138 --> 00:51:49,130
The American Consul really knows
how to survive in Pakistan.

782
00:51:49,258 --> 00:51:50,373
Let's enjoy our food.

783
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,887
This is a Cotes du Rhone.
1929 Cotes du Rhone.

784
00:51:53,018 --> 00:51:54,451
Wow, vinegar.

785
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:19,772
Steve's a good name.
Because you've got Stephen.

786
00:52:19,898 --> 00:52:23,937
You've got Steve, you've got Stevie.
Jonathan, Jon, Jonny.

787
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,696
-Formal, nickname, sex name.
-So, it'll be like...

788
00:52:25,818 --> 00:52:27,934
You know what's pretty is Alison.

789
00:52:28,058 --> 00:52:31,368
-Ali, Alison, Al, for instance.
-Jonny's like a little boy's name.

790
00:52:31,498 --> 00:52:33,534
-Theresa.
-You know, it's really old-fashioned.

791
00:52:33,658 --> 00:52:35,455
-Mother Theresa.
-No.

792
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:39,288
-Hey, Captain, what's up?
-<i>I'm afraid there's bad news.</i>

793
00:52:39,418 --> 00:52:40,897
What is it?

794
00:52:41,018 --> 00:52:42,815
<i>Danny's body has been found.</i>

795
00:52:42,938 --> 00:52:45,213
-<i>He's in the mor</i>g<i>ue.</i>
-Fuck.

796
00:52:45,818 --> 00:52:47,536
<i>Dost is on his way to coIIect you.</i>

797
00:52:47,658 --> 00:52:48,932
-Okay, thank you.
-What?

798
00:52:49,058 --> 00:52:52,892
We've gotta get over there.
Better get the guy here before we go.

799
00:52:53,578 --> 00:52:54,772
Fuck!

800
00:52:55,858 --> 00:52:58,292
Where's the guy?
Where's the waiter guy?

801
00:52:58,418 --> 00:53:02,172
John, fuck the bill.
What are you fucking talking about?

802
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:04,534
Fuck!

803
00:53:06,298 --> 00:53:08,095
What did he say?
What did Captain say?

804
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,652
He said they've got the body
in the morgue.

805
00:53:10,778 --> 00:53:14,453
<i>I come to you with a tra</i>g<i>ic deveIopment</i>

<i>He had severaI buIIet wounds.</i>

810
00:53:38,858 --> 00:53:41,053
Can you open the mouth?

811
00:53:44,418 --> 00:53:47,216
-lt's not Danny.
-What do you mean it's not Danny?

812
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:48,566
Well, he's got braces in his mouth...

813
00:53:48,698 --> 00:53:49,972
That's not fucking Danny.

814
00:53:50,098 --> 00:53:52,214
-What?
-lt's not fucking Danny.

815
00:53:57,378 --> 00:53:58,413
So wait, wait. l'm sorry.

816
00:53:58,538 --> 00:54:00,017
Are you doubting the fact
that l saw this?

817
00:54:00,138 --> 00:54:03,335
Are you actually asking me
to get you a second source?

818
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:06,530
Hello? Yeah, it's not fucking Danny.

819
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:11,687
No, it's a fucking lranian student,
for God's sakes.

820
00:54:11,818 --> 00:54:13,012
lt is not Danny.

821
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:15,288

All right, okay.

824
00:54:20,898 --> 00:54:25,096
l can't believe that they just
announced it without any confirmation.

825
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:26,970
Yeah, in the middle
of Super Bowl Sunday.

826
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:28,690
l can't imagine who those sources were.

827
00:54:28,818 --> 00:54:30,570
Everyone's calling the <i>JournaI</i>
for a quote.

828
00:54:30,698 --> 00:54:32,814
-lt's not Danny, you know that?
-<i>I know.</i>

829
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:34,815
<i>I've been taIkin</i>g <i>to the</i> Journal.

l know. We will be.

832
00:55:00,879 --> 00:55:04,189
Who's this gentleman Daniel Pearl
you keep mentioning again and again?

833
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,787
l'm not asking you about
his whereabouts, l just want to know...

834
00:55:06,919 --> 00:55:07,908
l don't know.

835
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:11,554
l've told you earlier,
l've never heard of this man before.

836
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:14,034
l'm saying,
what's your opinion about his articles?

837
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,196
l've never read his articles.
What are you trying to get at?

838
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:19,992
No, we have the mails which says,

839
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:21,950
''l spoke to Sheikh's secretary yesterday

840
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,991
''and he told me
that Sheikh Sahib has read your articles

841
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,030
''and that
you are welcome to meet him.''

842
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:28,797
You gave the appointment.

843
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:31,752
You read the articles.
lt says Bashir wrote to Daniel.

844
00:55:31,879 --> 00:55:35,315
Bashir wrote to Daniel Pearl,
why don't you ask Bashir?

845
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:38,113
Why don't you ask him?

846
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:45,473
Mariane?

847
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:48,877
We have caught Gilani.

848
00:55:48,999 --> 00:55:51,115
He was in Muzaffarabad
but he is here now.

849
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:54,549
-What did he say?
-He's not involved.

850
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:56,271
Wait, wait, wait.

851
00:55:57,279 --> 00:55:59,076
l thought Gilani was the guy?

852
00:55:59,759 --> 00:56:01,750
He was just the bait.

853
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,350
He was used as a bait.

854
00:56:07,279 --> 00:56:10,112
-So, there's no Gilani involved?
-No.

855
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:13,113
We go back to Arif,
we go back to Siddique and Bashir.

856
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:16,709
l don't see this as a negative thing,
l have to say.

857
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:17,794
This is a set-up.

858
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:19,511
l mean,
if Gilani has nothing to do with this

859
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:22,551
-some of these letters are bogus.
-lt's worse than that.

860
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,398
lt means that they've been planning
something for weeks.

861
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:28,989
And for weeks he thinks he's meeting
with Gilani and there is no Gilani.

862
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,074
And whoever these people are,

863
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:32,997
they're thinking about doing this
for weeks.

864
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:37,634
lt is disappointing.

865
00:56:37,759 --> 00:56:40,717
lt's just taking away one piece,
l don't see this as a negative thing.

866
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:43,831
lt's not a dead end,
l think it's quite the contrary.

867
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:56,553
Well, now, the good news is Zafir and
Farooq have traced one of the e-mails.

868
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:02,071
<i>It was sent from a server</i>
<i>in Noman City Apartments.</i>

869
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:05,957
There's a team of people
who are searching for the computer

870
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,708
<i>that was usin</i>g <i>the server</i>
<i>when the kidnapper e-maiI was sent.</i>

871
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:27,352
What's your name?

872
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:29,233
Farhad Naseem.

873
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,587
ls this computer yours?

874
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:33,392
-This computer is mine.
-Turn it on, please.

875
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:37,155
lt can't be switched on
because the hard disc has crashed.

876
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,598
What happened to the hard disc?

877
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:40,311
There was a virus on it and it crashed.

878
00:57:40,439 --> 00:57:42,270
l took it to repair two days ago.

879
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,390
-lt broke down two days ago?
-Yes.

880
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:45,474
Okay.

881
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:49,514
Take him in.

882
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:53,430
How many computers
have you connected in that building?

883
00:57:54,279 --> 00:57:55,871
ln that building, twenty or more.

884
00:57:55,999 --> 00:57:57,318
-Twenty?
-Yes.

885
00:57:57,439 --> 00:57:58,588
ls this your job?

886
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,358
Yes, this is what l do.

887
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:03,917
We are looking
for Daniel Pearl's photograph.

888
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:08,070
We have new software

889
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:11,077
that can recover deleted files
from your hard drive

890
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:12,837
just like that.

891
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:18,155
Whatever you know, just tell us now.
You won't have any difficulties.

892
00:58:18,279 --> 00:58:20,235
lf the Americans find out,
you'll be in big trouble

893
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:21,553
and we won't be able to help you.

894
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,194
There was no-one else?
You did it on your own?

895
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,594
No, sir,
my cousin Suleiman was with me.

896
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:28,313
-Okay, he's your cousin?
-Yes.

897
00:58:28,439 --> 00:58:29,588
Where does he live?

898
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:31,152
-He lives in Karachi.
-ls he in Karachi now?

899
00:58:31,279 --> 00:58:32,917
-Yes.
-Come on, let's go.

900
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:33,994
Well done.

901
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:38,148
ln the morning prayer,
everybody will come to know.

902
00:58:38,279 --> 00:58:40,839
So we have to find Danny tonight.

903
00:58:40,959 --> 00:58:41,948
Quickly, quickly.

904
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:50,268
This is the place.

905
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:01,147
There he is.

906
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,797
That's him.

907
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:08,232
Yes, he's the one.

908
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:24,114
Come on, move it.

909
00:59:30,919 --> 00:59:32,432
Get out of the way.

910
00:59:57,399 --> 00:59:58,354
Give me his phone.

911
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,436
Tell him what l told you to say.

912
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:09,394
lt's Suleiman.

913
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:13,107
Hello?

914
01:00:14,439 --> 01:00:16,828
-He says he's not there.
-Do you have his cell number?

915
01:00:16,959 --> 01:00:18,836
-Yes.
-Then let's try it.

916
01:00:19,399 --> 01:00:20,388
Be quiet.

917
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:24,307
Suleiman speaking.

918
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:27,833
-What do you want?
-l need to speak to you.

919
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:30,757
l need to meet you urgently.

920
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:34,394
Not now. We'll meet up early
tomorrow morning and talk. Okay?

921
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,670
Hello? Hello, Adil?

922
01:00:38,479 --> 01:00:40,310
Sir, he's saying we'll speak tomorrow.

923
01:00:40,439 --> 01:00:42,031
Take down this number.

924
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,194
Open the door.

925
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,710
Sir, this is the phone company.

926
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,430
Yeah, this is Javed Habib, ClD Chief.

927
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:53,598
l need some information about the last
phone call made on this phone.

928
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:59,669
Which cell tower received a signal
on the last phone call?

929
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:04,189
We don't have any time, you bastard.

930
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:06,550
Let's go. Let's go.

931
01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:09,709
Yeah, Randall, come along.

932
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:16,594
ClD!

933
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,234
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

934
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:23,838
We need to trace a number.

935
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:27,636
Sorry, sir, the office is closed, we can't
give you any information right now.

936
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:30,114
What do you need
to do with this number?

937
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,309
l am ClD Chief Javed Habib.

938
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:33,918
You know what l can do?

939
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:35,950
Screw your confidentiality,
l need that information.

940
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,717
A man has been kidnapped, a foreigner.

941
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,716
lf something happens to him,
Pakistan will have a bad reputation.

942
01:01:41,479 --> 01:01:43,674
-You okay?
-Yeah, man.

943
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:46,552
We just have to go a little careful
with this one.

944
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:48,476
-Why?
-Oh, he's a Jihadi.

945
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:49,827
He was in Afghanistan.

946
01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:52,519
-He's a police officer as well.
-ln my unit.

947
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:55,676
Oh, God. l love this town.

948
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:18,152
-Who's there?
-Don't move.

949
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,716
-Put your hands up.
-Take him away.

950
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:22,874
You'll be sorry.

951
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:24,628
God is great.

952
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:26,628
God is great.

953
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:45,074
Where is Daniel Pearl?

954
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,274
l don't know.

955
01:02:47,879 --> 01:02:48,834
What do you know?

956
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:50,674
l don't know anything.

957
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:55,357
Tell me whatever you know.

958
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:01,638
l don't know anything.

959
01:03:04,839 --> 01:03:05,794
What do you know?

960
01:03:12,919 --> 01:03:13,874
What do you know?

961
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:15,274
Just tell me.

962
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,708
What do you know?

963
01:03:18,919 --> 01:03:19,954
What did you do?

964
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:21,514
l don't know anything.

965
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:23,550
-What do you know?
-Nothing.

966
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:31,675
-What do you know?
-Nothing.

967
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:37,558
Who asked you to e-mail?

968
01:03:43,999 --> 01:03:45,034
Who are you working for?

969
01:03:45,879 --> 01:03:46,994
Who asked you to e-mail?

970
01:03:47,759 --> 01:03:49,272
Sheikh Omar.

971
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:09,077
-Dost, come in.
-<i>I'm here, Captain.</i>

972
01:04:46,879 --> 01:04:47,834
Quickly, come on.

973
01:04:53,479 --> 01:04:54,673
Check all the rooms.

974
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,431
Search everything.

975
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:00,314
Who are you people?

976
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:02,589
ls this the way to come into
respectable people's homes?

977
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,593
Where's Sheikh Omar?

978
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:06,198
You must have a contact number.

979
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:10,073
Nine-zero-seven-zero
two-seven-two-six.

980
01:05:10,479 --> 01:05:11,753
Where is Sheikh Omar?

981
01:05:11,879 --> 01:05:13,790
-We don't know anything.
-Give me Adil's phone.

982
01:05:13,919 --> 01:05:14,908
Come on.

983
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,154
Give me Adil's phone.

984
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:20,995
We've got Omar's number.

985
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:35,473
Hello?

986
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:36,914
Omar Sheikh?

987
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:39,234
Yes?

988
01:05:39,799 --> 01:05:41,835
lt's Javed Habib speaking,
Omar Sheikh.

989
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:45,636
We have all the information,
we know everything about you.

990
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,476
Farhad, Adil, Suleiman,
we have all of them.

991
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:50,952
Check your caller lD.

992
01:05:59,879 --> 01:06:01,471
He's cut the phone.

993
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,717
Come on, bring them out.

994
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:29,955
Adil told us
that he met Omar in Afghanistan.

995
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,675
Suddenly l realised
Bashir was Omar Saeed Sheikh.

996
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,630
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

997
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:41,275
The FBl found Danny's photos
on this guy Farhad's computer

998
01:06:41,399 --> 01:06:44,550
who is the key to Sheikh Omar.

999
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:47,751
So we've had this article
and we just put it away

1000
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,676
and it was about Omar Saeed Sheikh.

1001
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:51,198
l have it here somewhere.

1002
01:06:51,319 --> 01:06:53,196
Okay, look, here it is, here it is.

1003
01:06:53,319 --> 01:06:57,835
''British born and educated.
A known Jihadist.

1004
01:06:57,959 --> 01:07:01,588
''Arrested for kidnapping
four tourists in lndia,

1005
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:03,471
''one American, three British.

1006
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,352
''The four were freed unharmed.''

1007
01:07:06,479 --> 01:07:07,878
-They were freed unharmed?
-Yeah.

1008
01:07:07,999 --> 01:07:09,955
So this guy is a serious, serious player.

1009
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,388
He was arrested in 1994
for this kidnapping

1010
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:17,070
and put in an lndian prison until 1999.

1011
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,111
-Why was he released?
-There was a hostage swap.

1012
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:23,675
An lndian aeroplane was hijacked
and flown to Afghanistan.

1013
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:25,517
He's Al Qaeda.

1014
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:28,199
He has connections,
yes, we know. But...

1015
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,873
Close connection, it says, to Al Qaeda.

1016
01:07:35,439 --> 01:07:38,033
We arrested his two cousins.

1017
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,071
We will fight kidnappers
with kidnappings.

1018
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:35,277
Are you okay?

1019
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:38,277
-Mariane, what's wrong?
-Yeah, l'm all right. l'm all right.

1020
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,593
Fuck.

1021
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:43,834
Are you okay?

1022
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:50,517
Foetal heart sound
and the blood pressure is quite normal.

1023
01:08:50,639 --> 01:08:53,676
l will give you some medicine.
You will feel definitely better. Okay?

1024
01:08:53,799 --> 01:08:55,596
Okay. Thank you.

1025
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,233
''Making a habit of not urinating
when you feel the need

1026
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:02,238
''increases the risk that your inflamed
bladder may irritate the uterus

1027
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:03,394
''and set off contractions.

1028
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:05,749
''So don't hold it in.''

01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:08,354
-l'll remember that.
-That was in caps.

1030
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,947
-So don't hold it in.
-So don't hold it in.

1031
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:14,552
Do you wanna
go share those notes with Mariane?

1032
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:15,668
Do you think l should?

1033
01:09:15,799 --> 01:09:16,993
ls there anything on breast-feeding?

1034
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:19,349
There's a lot on breast-feeding
but we're not there yet, Steve.

1035
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:21,117
Do you have kids?

1036
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:22,873
No.

1037
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:37,117
Come on, look happy.

1038
01:09:37,959 --> 01:09:40,837
Right, you're a happy girl. Happy girl.

1039
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:44,708
There it is. Now l can tell all my friends
that you are happy.

1040
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,157
You can get old and fat
and grey and grumpy.

1041
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:58,839
-And curvy.
-But don't lose your smile.

1042
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:11,833
Oh, shit.

1043
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:15,956
lt does smell like that picture.

1044
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:17,990
You're so uncultured.

1045
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:20,713
There's a potential
new e-mail from CNN.

1046
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:26,077
''We had informed the US if our
demands were not met within 24 hours

1047

''we would kill Daniel Pearl.

1048

''Now Mr Bush can find his body
in the graveyards of Karachi.

''We have thrown him there.''

1050
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:39,757
-Do we think it's another hoax?
-Get all the phones on silent, shall we?

1051
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,671
Let me call Captain.

1052
01:11:47,799 --> 01:11:49,790
Why Danny?

1053
01:11:49,919 --> 01:11:51,113
The <i>JournaI,</i> a few weeks ago,

1054
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:53,628
handed over to the ClA a computer

1055
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:56,114
which had information
about Richard Reid

1056
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,434
and his attempts to blow up
the American Airline flight.

1057
01:11:58,559 --> 01:12:01,471
And then you guys
told everyone that you did that.

1058
01:12:01,599 --> 01:12:03,430
Mariane, look at this.

1059
01:12:03,799 --> 01:12:07,428
The <i>WaII Street JournaI</i> is telling
everybody it's co-operating with the ClA.

1060
01:12:07,559 --> 01:12:11,154
We turned the computer over
because we had no choice.

1061
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:12,837
-Okay. Okay.
-lt was a matter of national security.

1062
01:12:12,959 --> 01:12:15,996
To an outsider it could look like
the ClA are in bed with the <i>JournaI.</i>

1063
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:18,235
So, what, you think it's no factor?
Just ignore it?

1064
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:21,112
l don't think Danny was taken because
he worked for the <i>WaII Street JournaI.</i>

1065
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:22,228
We don't know.

1066
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:25,431
They know where he works
and they say ClA. lt's something.

1067
01:12:25,559 --> 01:12:28,437
Let's be honest about it,
they call everybody a spy.

1068
01:12:28,559 --> 01:12:32,996
lf you're an lndian in Pakistan,
you must be an lndian spy.

1069
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:35,110
All right, here's what l think.

1070
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:37,355
Two days before Danny was kidnapped

1071
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:40,869
the US asked Pakistan
to hand over Omar Saeed Sheikh.

1072
01:12:40,999 --> 01:12:45,709
Now, Omar was supposed to have sent
money to Mohammed Atta prior to 9/1 1 .

1073
01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:46,954
Now, rumours are

1074
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:50,151
that this money came from
Lieutenant General Mahmood Ahmed

1075
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:52,315
who was the head of the lSl.

1076
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:55,875
Now, on October 7th,
Musharraf dismissed the General.

1077
01:12:56,599 --> 01:12:59,193
Now, was that
because of his involvement?

1078
01:13:06,999 --> 01:13:08,193
-Hello?
-<i>Mariane?</i>

1079
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:11,038
-Yes?
-<i>We've</i> g<i>ot Omar Saeed Sheikh.</i>

1080
01:13:19,799 --> 01:13:21,835
ls Daniel Pearl still alive?

1081
01:13:23,839 --> 01:13:25,636
l haven't a clue.

1082
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:31,236
Do you know where he is?

1083
01:13:32,559 --> 01:13:34,436
l wish l could help you.

1084
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:40,871
Who is holding him?

1085
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,796
l don't know.

1086
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:48,239
That was the whole point
of the operation,

1087
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:51,078
so that each person
knows as little as possible.

1088
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,996
Why did you kidnap him?

1089
01:13:53,799 --> 01:13:56,518
-Why?
-Why did you kidnap him?

1090
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,992
-He was an American.
-He was an American? Just that?

1091
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:02,108
Yeah.

1092
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,707
You think you are a good Muslim?

1093
01:14:06,919 --> 01:14:10,707
At least l have the strength
to stand for something l believe in,

1094
01:14:10,839 --> 01:14:13,399
unlike others in this room.

1095
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,598
How old is your son?

1096
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:17,949
He's a baby, Captain. Cute little baby.

1097
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,070
-You miss him?
-Desperately.

1098
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:23,189
You want to see him?

1099
01:14:23,319 --> 01:14:27,107
<i>InshaIIah,</i> if Allah wills then it will be so.

1100
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:29,594
-What about your baby?
-We can arrange for that.

1101
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:32,995
Do you want to see your baby grow old?

1102
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:42,391
Omar Saeed Sheikh handed himself in
over a week ago, on February the 5th.

1103
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:45,477
lt was the same night that
the raid was made on his aunt's house.

1104
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:47,590
Where has he been?

1105
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:51,155
He handed himself
in to Brigadier Ejaz Shah.

1106
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:53,031
He is the Home Secretary of Punjab.

1107
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:54,717
This guy is ex-lSl.

1108
01:14:54,839 --> 01:14:59,549
He's connected to Omar's family and he
kept Omar's arrest a secret for a week.

1109
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:04,638
-Was he being interrogated by the lSl?
-We don't know.

1110
01:15:04,759 --> 01:15:07,432
Omar is gone for a week?
He's gone for a week?

1111
01:15:07,559 --> 01:15:08,628
What does he say about Danny?

1112
01:15:08,759 --> 01:15:11,831
He doesn't say anything about that. Yet.

1113
01:15:15,759 --> 01:15:17,556
-Mariane?
-What?

1114
01:15:31,559 --> 01:15:33,515
<i>British-born miIitant Sheikh Omar</i>

1115

<i>his face covered.</i>

1116
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:43,431
Do you know
where Daniel Pearl is being held?

1117
01:15:43,559 --> 01:15:44,787
No, l don't.

1118
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:48,514
Do you know if Daniel Pearl is alive?

1119
01:15:49,919 --> 01:15:51,352
As far as l know

1120
01:15:52,879 --> 01:15:54,107
he is not alive.

1121
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:57,878
On February 5th,
l spoke to my brothers on the phone

1122
01:15:57,999 --> 01:16:00,797
and l told them
to take the patient to the doctor's.

1123
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:04,038
This was a code to release the hostage.

1124
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:06,230
But it was too late.

1125
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:09,310
So it's bullshit.

1126
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:13,109
They're just liars,
they're just psychos and liars.

l would let you speak to her,
but she doesn't speak Urdu.

1151
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:46,114
Okay?

1152

Whatever you want. Whatever you want.

1153

No, he just hung up on me.

1154
01:19:52,639 --> 01:19:56,951
lt's fine. They were making contact.
That's good, that's fine.

But they don't say what they want.
They don't say what they want.

No. They're still toying with us.
They know we're getting close.

1157
01:20:03,919 --> 01:20:05,796
Do you think they'll call back?

1158
01:20:05,919 --> 01:20:08,672
Well, unless we get to them first.

01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:04,355
No, because...

1214
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:07,596
Because we've, you know,
been through this before.

1215
01:26:10,119 --> 01:26:12,394
-They can...
-We have a video.

1216
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:18,518
They had a knife and they used it
in a way that leaves no doubt.

1217
01:26:27,839 --> 01:26:29,875
What does that mean?

1218
01:26:29,999 --> 01:26:31,193
Mariane...

1219
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:34,036
He was beheaded.

1220
01:26:42,679 --> 01:26:47,036
Oh, God. No, no, no... What?
What? No, no.

1221
01:26:50,799 --> 01:26:52,949
You watched that?

1222
01:26:54,039 --> 01:26:56,997
l never, never want to see it!

1223
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,028
Turn off the fucking phone!

1224
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:33,236
l love you.

1225
01:28:10,879 --> 01:28:12,107
l'm here, Mariane.

1226
01:28:13,879 --> 01:28:17,872
<i>The day my brother arrived</i>
<i>was the day of Eid-uI-Adha.</i>

1227
01:28:17,999 --> 01:28:21,674
<i>The day when every MusIim famiIy</i>
<i>sacrifices an animaI to God.</i>

1228
01:28:21,799 --> 01:28:26,315
<i>In remembrance of Ibrahim's</i>
<i>wiIIin</i>g<i>ness to sacrifice his son IshmaeI.</i>

1229
01:28:30,879 --> 01:28:33,347
<i>The meat is then</i>
<i>divided into three parts,</i>

1230
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:37,597
<i>one for the famiIy, one for the</i>
<i>nei</i>g<i>hbour, and one for the poor.</i>

1231
01:28:38,879 --> 01:28:41,234
<i>Mariane, thank you so much</i>
<i>for bein</i>g <i>with us today.</i>

1232
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:43,475
<i>You came to Pakistan in peace.</i>

1233
01:28:43,599 --> 01:28:46,397
<i>You came here seekin</i>g <i>the truth,</i>
<i>with your husband.</i>

1234
01:28:46,519 --> 01:28:48,271
<i>Now you Ieave Pakistan as a widow</i>

1235
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:50,469
<i>after your husband</i>
<i>was brutaIIy murdered.</i>

1236
01:28:50,599 --> 01:28:53,955
What message do you have
for the people of Pakistan?

1237
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:57,196
Danny was killed this month.

1238
01:28:57,879 --> 01:29:02,555
But also 10 other people
were killed by terrorists

1239
01:29:02,679 --> 01:29:04,749
and they were all Pakistani.

1240
01:29:04,879 --> 01:29:08,554
So they are suffering
as much as we are, right?

1241
01:29:08,679 --> 01:29:11,591
<i>WeII, how do you address some</i>
<i>Pakistanis who have sympathies</i>

1242
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:14,756
<i>for miIitant</i> g<i>roups such as those</i>
<i>who kiIIed your husband?</i>

1243
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:21,752
Karachi is in some way
the front line of this battle.

1244
01:29:21,879 --> 01:29:25,394
<i>It is not</i>
<i>just a</i> g<i>roup of extremist Pakistani.</i>

1245
01:29:25,519 --> 01:29:29,068
<i>It is a vast</i>
<i>and internationaI network of terrorists.</i>

1246
01:29:30,039 --> 01:29:33,714
And wherever there is misery,
they find people

1247
01:29:33,839 --> 01:29:37,912
and there is misery, you know,
in lots of parts of the world.

1248
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,392
<i>CertainIy that may be the case,</i>

1249
01:29:39,519 --> 01:29:43,398
<i>but have you seen the videotape</i>
<i>of what they did to your husband?</i>

1250
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,231
Have you no decency?

1251
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:50,190
<i>How do you ask me that?</i>

1252
01:29:51,159 --> 01:29:52,353
<i>Mariane, I'm...</i>

1253
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:53,434
<i>Thank you for bein</i>g <i>with us today.</i>

1254
01:29:53,559 --> 01:29:55,436
Okay, l think we're done.

1255
01:29:55,559 --> 01:29:57,868
-S-a-t-c-h-i.
-Satchi.

1256
01:29:57,999 --> 01:30:00,638
-That's okay.
-And a middle name, please, Satchi.

1257
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:13,389
Okay. Excuse me.

1258
01:30:13,519 --> 01:30:15,794
l'm sorry. Back, back.

1259
01:30:17,519 --> 01:30:18,713
ls there another way out of here?

1260
01:30:18,839 --> 01:30:20,431
Yeah, l know another way.
Please follow me.

1261
01:30:20,559 --> 01:30:22,675
-Please. Come. This way.
-Okay.

1262
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:26,551
Fucking mob.

1263
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:28,758
-This way, please.
-Here?

1264
01:30:28,879 --> 01:30:30,517
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

1265
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:33,639
Thank you, Kasim. We appreciate it.
Thank you.

1266
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:35,638
lt's crazy, they're everywhere.

1267

That's great.

1270
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:40,870
One more of these.

1271
01:31:46,439 --> 01:31:49,397
l just wanted
to say something to everybody.

1272
01:31:49,519 --> 01:31:51,874
l want to, l want to thank you

1273
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:58,191
for all of your work and all of your effort

1274
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:00,275
and your kindness

1275
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:06,588
and l know how much you wanted
to find and bring Danny home.

1276
01:32:09,759 --> 01:32:12,353
You did not fail, you know?

1277
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:18,758
Danny's dead, but the kidnappers,

1278
01:32:18,879 --> 01:32:23,270
their point is to terrorise people, right?

1279
01:32:23,399 --> 01:32:26,948
l am not terrorised.
And you can't be terrorised.

1280
01:32:27,079 --> 01:32:30,515
l am very grateful to all of you.
Very, very grateful. So thank you.

1281
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,436
So please, let's eat.

1282
01:32:44,599 --> 01:32:48,148
Everything looks very good. lt's great.

1283
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:49,792
This is terrific.

1284
01:33:19,759 --> 01:33:20,953
Bye.

1285
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:24,997
Bye. Take care.

1286
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:27,633
Thank you so much. Take care.

-Thanks.
-Bye.

1288
01:33:30,999 --> 01:33:33,069
All right. l'll see you.

1289
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:19,348
Oh, my daughter.

1290
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,032
You are so beautiful.

1291
01:34:27,759 --> 01:34:30,671
ln Buddhism there is no god.

1292
01:34:30,839 --> 01:34:34,115
The aim of Buddhism
is to draw out all the strength,

1293
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:37,276
courage, wisdom and goodwill.

1294
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:42,038
You make me happy
every time you smile.

1295
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:45,469
We're gonna create
a beautiful world together.

1296
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:52,589
The wine represents joy.

1297
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:01,791
The breaking of the glass
symbolises the fragility of human joy.

1298
01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:05,477
And also the breaking of innocence.

1299
01:35:29,999 --> 01:35:32,672
<i>They found Danny's body</i>

01:35:47,839 --> 01:35:51,036
<i>I have to confront everythin</i>g
