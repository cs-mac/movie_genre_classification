1
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,434
STUPID BOY

4
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,836
- Hello.
Hi.

5
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,355
- Did I chat with you on line?

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,197
Yeah.

7
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,876
- Let's go.

8
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,830
Can I order what I want?
- Of course.

9
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,397
I'll have... I don't know.

10
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,678
A small De Luxe Menu.

11
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,275
- Aren't you hungry?
Don't you want a big one?

12
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,116
Well, we just met.
- A large De Luxe.

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,112
All right.

14
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,513
Well, no. A Cheese Royal.

15
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,116
Welcome to MacDonald's.
Your order, please.

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,232
Oh, no. Ice cubes!

17
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,308
- We said no ice cubes.

18
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,071
They're idiots, that's all.

19
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,518
You can't trust them.

20
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,554
Can I put this...

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,671
- Go ahead.

22
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,629
- What's your name?

23
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,071
Excuse me.

24
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,755
Mark. And you?

25
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,474
- Did you see how long
it took you to answer?

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,636
- 10 minutes!

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,956
- So tell me, what's your name?

28
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,752
Something was stuck.

29
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,790
- What's your name?

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,836
I said Mark.

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,513
- Come on. What is it?

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,550
And you?

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,830
- My real name? I'll tell you.

34
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,669
What is it?
- Lionel.

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,076
Lionel?

36
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,150
- And your's?

37
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,510
Loic.

38
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,873
- Why didn't you tell me before?

39
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,748
I don't know.

40
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,197
If I use an alias it's because
I don't want to tell you.

41
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,275
- On line, I understand, but here...

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,392
- What's the difference?

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,513
- Loic is nice. Unusual.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,789
It's from Brittany.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,353
- Are you from Brittany?

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,433
My parents met there.

47
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,310
- In Brittany?

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,792
They were at a demonstration
against oil spills or something.

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,549
They met there.

50
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,997
You want to know all about me.

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,633
- You can tell me to fuck off.

52
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,230
I'm just trying to protect

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,790
my character's intimacy
facing your's. I mean...

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,712
- Your character!
- I'm playing a role.

55
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,872
We don't know each other.

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,993
- It's great to eat.

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,874
- When was the last time?

58
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,112
It's been at least a day.

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,758
- A day?
- Yeah.

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,437
- Why?

61
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,949
I'm saving money.

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,309
- Economising on food?

63
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,228
I've already put some money aside.

64
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,674
- It's not a great idea.

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,196
I don't mind.

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,434
Food costs a lot.

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,430
- Never hungry?

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,835
I have a system.

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,155
- A system?

70
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,676
I have a system.

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,279
Aspirin with Maalox.

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,079
- You take aspirin and Maalox.

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,190
You know about that?

74
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,315
Photos aren't allowed.

75
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,992
- You finished work early?
Today, yeah.

76
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,516
- How are you?

77
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,870
- Like your picture?

78
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,317
- It's nice.

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,512
- You don't.

80
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,508
- You're working?
Yes.

81
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,678
"REFLECTIONS ON
HITLERIAN PHILOSOPHY"

82
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,551
- What's that?

83
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,951
Hitlerian...

84
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,116
- Hitler.

85
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,630
- You know Hitler.

86
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,749
Ah... Hitlerian.
I didn't understand.

87
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,436
Notice anything?

88
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,758
- Notice anything about me?

89
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,272
My eyebrow... The piercing.

90
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,598
- You see something?
Yeah. I see.

91
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,072
- It's a piercing.
Yes, I know.

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,997
- How do you like it?
Why did you do it?

93
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,758
I called right away.
Otherwise I wouldn't do it.

94
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,275
He disinfected it, then pinched
the skin gently and clack!

95
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,029
Did it hurt?

96
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,116
- A bit.

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,152
Good Evening.

98
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,715
- 2 tickets, please.

99
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,273
We close in 10 minutes.

100
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,111
- Go right in.

101
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,751
- Can you give me 10 minutes?

102
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,234
I'll take some pictures.

103
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,276
Do you mind?

104
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,150
You coming?

105
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,389
Be careful.

106
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,551
Do you want to sleep over?

107
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,279
I live alone.

108
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,152
If you want, you can stay.
It's not a problem.

109
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,915
Where do I put the condom?

110
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,440
- Leave it on the sink,
I'll take care of it.

111
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,678
Do you have someone? A lover?

112
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,474
I'm all alone.

113
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,673
I had someone last year
for about 2 or 3 weeks.

114
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,749
He was a very egocentric guy
and didn't take care of me.

115
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,679
I want someone to care of me
and I would care for him.

116
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,232
- I want to live as a normal couple

117
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,355
and not just sit in a corner

118
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,598
waiting for someone to draw near,
waiting for someone to want me.

119
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,795
He got up in the morning
and went right to the computer.

120
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,954
He went to the computer after lunch.

121
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,274
He was always at the computer.

122
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,633
- How do you get home?

123
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,356
- I stay with girlfriend in Lausanne.

124
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,349
- There aren't any
late trains to Bulle.

125
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,634
- You sleep at her place?
- Yes.

126
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,910
- Are you bi or gay?

127
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,076
- No, I'm gay.

128
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,668
- She's a friend. It's a long story.

129
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,074
- We care for each other.

130
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,270
- It's affection.

131
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,315
What's that devilish look?

132
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,234
- I was thinking about
all of your adventures.

133
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,351
Oh yeah?

134
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,635
- You're real

135
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,155
hot on line.

136
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,353
- You're direct.

137
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,832
- You don't go on and on.

138
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,311
Why waste time? Can you tell me?

139
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,112
- Before sex it's interesting to...
- Internet is expensive.

140
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,835
- What's interesting before sex
is seduction, even on line.

141
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,309
Seduction?
- Yes.

142
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,673
- Waiting a bit... Desiring the other...

143
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,394
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

144
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,557
I'm direct. With me it's:
" Come here and Bang! "

145
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,354
We meet and that's it.

146
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,109
- I don't want to piss you off but

147
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,631
to desire someone
you should wait awhile,

148
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,671
you should try, just a little.

149
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,671
It depends if you want to fuck or if
you're looking for something more.

150
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,873
You prefer feelings?

151
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,516
- It's about the pleasure of
being with someone

152
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,233
even for a moment.

153
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,549
- Even for a brief moment.
The pleasure of being together.

154
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,477
- In fact, sex itself
isn't that important.

155
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,909
I never...
- I don't want to disappoint you.

156
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,476
I never thought about it.
But I don't like to waste time.

157
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,796
- Understand?

158
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,994
I have to do this, so
go away for a moment.

159
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,758
- I made 300 francs last night.

160
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,312
How?

161
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,918
I was by the lake
and a car came up.

162
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,674
I went over because I thought
the guy was good-looking.

163
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,755
But not really.
He was an old man, about 75.

164
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,519
I told him no. I was polite, but I
said it was out of the question.

165
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,513
He offered 300 francs.

166
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,036
- For 300, you just close your eyes.

167
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,035
- So I got in and we
went to his place.

168
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,350
- I undressed.

169
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,672
He sucked me,
I sucked him, the usual stuff.

170
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,515
But then he wanted
me to eat him out!

171
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,120
I slide 1 finger in,
then 2, but then,

172
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,957
listen to this,

173
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,352
he pulled out a long flashlight.
I should have asked for 500 francs!

174
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,316
- It was as wide as this and round.

175
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,796
Stop!

176
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,595
I don't want to know.

177
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,836
Why not?

178
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,159
Why not? Not interested?

179
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,635
I don't want to know.

180
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,670
- Stop it. I don't want to know.

181
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,872
- You're a prude!

182
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,237
- Excuse me.

183
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,233
You know what they're up to?

184
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,429
They're going to fuck.

185
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,948
They're going to fuck.
- Shut up!

186
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,757
" Shut up "?
I watched them the other day.

187
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,548
What?
- Just stop it.

188
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,876
They can't hear us.

189
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,515
People don't fuck
all the time like you.

190
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,189
They live normal lives.

191
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,277
They didn't want us to follow them.

192
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,359
Some people are simply
interested in life, in things...

193
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,117
Things!

194
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,189
- People don't always go to
museums with ulterior motives,

195
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,673
with twisted minds.

196
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,595
Something...

197
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,439
something strange
happened the other day.

198
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,514
How can I explain?
It's the first time.

199
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,031
I was on line, as usual.

200
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,997
I chatted with this guy.

201
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,877
We talked ass, then
made a rendezvous

202
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,029
at MacDonald's in Bulle.

203
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,078
You getting lurid again?

204
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,670
- He asked me
all kinds of questions.

205
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,556
- Usually you talk sex. But not him.

206
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,995
He really wanted to know about me.
It sort of threw me off.

207
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,588
Why are you so intrigued?

208
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,798
Why am I intrigued?

209
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,155
It's his honesty.

210
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,152
These encounters are
usually pretty cold.

211
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,318
But there, something happened.

212
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,239
He was normal
and asked normal questions.

213
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,236
I trusted him.

214
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,915
I even spoke about you.

215
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,316
What did you say?

216
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,790
You interested?
- Yes. It was about me.

217
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,750
- The truth.

218
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,032
Like what?
- I can't tell you everything.

219
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,000
I said that you were kind
and you help me out

220
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,111
letting me stay with you in Lausanne.

221
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,959
- That you squat at
my place and that I'm easy.

222
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,958
Yeah, I play the
male role in this story!

223
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,198
No, but that I stay
with you, you're cool

224
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,192
and very nice to me.

225
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,477
- Yeah, I'm nice.
- You're very patient.

226
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,635
- I'm very nice.

227
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,076
I said so.

228
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,839
Then he asked if I'm bi.

229
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,039
I said no, I'm gay.

230
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,430
- I never did that before.

231
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,877
Why?

232
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,308
It's nobody's business.

233
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,711
- Seeing him again?

234
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,155
He said yes.

235
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,432
Have you been in love?
- Yes.

236
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,475
Yes?
- Yes.

237
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,750
- For real.

238
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,473
With a young man?
- Yes.

239
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,313
A man?
- Of course. Why?

240
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,274
How did you meet?

241
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,272
- We had mutual friends.

242
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,992
You mean that a
friend introduced you

243
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,597
and it happened.
- We got along and fell in love.

244
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,150
What's it like to be in love?
How do you feel inside?

245
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,710
- When you wake up in the morning

246
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,316
you see the world differently,
as if you were standing on a chair.

247
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,670
- Normally you see a room
from a certain angle.

248
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,873
- Then you climb up and look
down and everything is different.

249
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,711
- Being in love is like that.

250
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,950
Fascinating!

251
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,634
- Climbing on chairs?

252
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,271
Listening to you,
knowing you're in love.

253
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,230
Are you still in love?
- No. It's over.

254
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,919
So now it's as if you fell off the
chair head first and broke your jaw.

255
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:54,871
- Exactly.

256
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,991
The room is as it was before.
- Exactly.

257
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,078
- But from an lower point of view.

258
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,397
Okay.

259
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,909
- Slowly.

260
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,636
- Stop!

261
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,350
You're scaring me.

262
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,436
Don't be an idiot.

263
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,313
- When I drive I like...

264
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,748
You never drive, it's my car.

265
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,190
It's dangerous.

266
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,233
Your dad let me drive the
tractor like I wanted to.

267
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,112
- Don't mention that asshole.

268
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,150
Stop! Stop!

269
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,469
- Something broke!

270
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,991
Pull over there.

271
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,238
Did you look in
the rear view mirror?

272
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,158
God, you're ignorant!

273
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,950
Over there.
- You're stressing me out.

274
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,037
- Pull over. We're in
the middle of the road.

275
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,555
What a kill-joy!

276
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,839
- Kill-joy! Turn it off.

277
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,111
Idiot!

278
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,072
- It's not easy. You keep shouting.

279
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,635
The problem is that
you're being an asshole.

280
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,514
Now let's get going.

281
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,356
The hands of a watch.

282
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,269
I don't want to say it each time.

283
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,272
"Hands of a watch"
doesn't mean anything.

284
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,233
We just did it 10 times.

285
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,679
- Like the hands of a watch...

286
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,229
At this rate it will take
time just to start the car!

287
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,748
You can't talk out loud
at the driving test.

288
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,390
I talk out loud

289
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,350
to remember.

290
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,199
- In the meantime,
you're not starting the car.

291
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,191
Thank you.

292
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,829
Seat belt?

293
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,558
- With you at the wheel
I should wear a harness.

294
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,512
A harness!
- And a helmet.

295
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,959
- I need calm when I drive.

296
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,398
- Stop blaspheming all the time.

297
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,352
Blasphemy?

298
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,035
- Do you know what that means?

299
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,115
- It's pretty complicated to explain.

300
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,833
Yes, it's pretty complicated.

301
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,758
But the word "blasphemy"...

302
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,109
- It means you make fun of me.

303
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,713
It means making fun of you!

304
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,834
A blasphemer is someone who
speaks badly about Loic?

305
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:16,872
- Right?

306
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,912
Go on! Make fun of me.

307
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,033
Blasphemy means
speaking against God.

308
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,715
- So is Loic God?

309
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,718
- That's blasphemy?

310
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,478
It means to curse God.

311
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,037
- You're a pain in the ass
with your blaspheming!

312
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,510
- Yes, God.

313
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,038
Shit!

314
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,391
Please!

315
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,636
Calm down.

316
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,395
You could knock.

317
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,039
- I knock before coming in.

318
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,195
You have a problem?

319
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,310
- Don't you see that...

320
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,638
You didn't used to be so shy.
- That's finished.

321
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,753
" I'm a man now "!

322
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,390
Pass me a towel.
- I have lotion on my hands.

323
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,153
Lotion!
- Hand lotion.

324
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,834
- Give me the towel.

325
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,071
- Please.

326
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,670
- Give me that.

327
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,716
Fuck!

328
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,757
Get out!

329
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,109
I'm getting scorched.

330
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,716
Please, get out.

331
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,719
Give me the towel and
get out, Marie, please!

332
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,715
Install the exercise bar
because I have to...

333
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,711
Watch out!

334
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,829
Install it. I have a bad back.
- Get out!

335
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,269
- Now I know what I want to do.

336
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,116
Photography.

337
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,189
- Be a photographer.

338
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,836
Great!

339
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,159
- A photographer friend
liked my photos.

340
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,509
A professional?

341
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,995
Semi-professional. He does it
for pleasure but he's good.

342
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,075
He said I work well.

343
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,711
With the mobile?

344
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,596
- He thought the photos were good
and that I have some understanding.

345
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,119
It's a big step from pushing
buttons to becoming a photographer.

346
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,438
And you could do it.

347
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,190
You could learn in school.

348
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,198
There's no technique!

349
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,389
No technique?

350
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,198
Do you know about light, about...
It's an art, it's not

351
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,350
just snapping a...
with a telephone.

352
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,558
My friend knows a
little more than you do.

353
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,235
He said my pictures
of you were good.

354
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,269
This guy shows up and says:

355
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,835
" You can be a photographer. "

356
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,635
He's changed your life.
Are you in love?

357
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,114
I believe him. And he's not
after my body. He's a friend.

358
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,870
It is a chance to travel.

359
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,837
To go to Africa, film lions,
civilisations, villages, anything.

360
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,034
The things I like.

361
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,671
" Impressionist " things.

362
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,153
Impressionist photography!

363
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,719
He taught you that word.
- No. I...

364
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,553
- Why always mention him?

365
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,876
Do you know what it means?

366
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,159
It's when you take
pictures spontaneously.

367
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,396
You don't know what that means.

368
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,669
- Yes I do.

369
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,352
Hold on. He told you that you
were a very "Impressionistic " boy.

370
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,150
Wait a minute. I was only joking.

371
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,591
- Loic.

372
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,996
- Sorry.

373
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,196
It's...

374
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,393
It's a good idea.

375
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,753
Is that why you laughed?

376
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,231
No, but " Impressionism "!

377
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:22,951
So?

378
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,038
Don't you think I know what it is?

379
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,148
It was created by Impressionists,

380
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,994
such as Lenoir and company.

381
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,799
It was new at the time.

382
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,154
I don't see why I
can't do something new?

383
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,116
True.

384
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,350
Honestly.

385
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,239
I read about it.

386
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,520
I'm not an idiot who forgets things.

387
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,436
That's not it.

388
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,118
What will you photograph?

389
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,950
I told you.

390
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,235
Okay, but...

391
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,596
You always talk about leaving.

392
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,233
I want to go away.
- Why?

393
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,592
Photograph people in Bulle.

394
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,712
What can I photograph in Bulle?

395
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,036
The people.

396
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,154
The factory.

397
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,396
You should stop studying, get a job
and see what a factory is like.

398
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,991
Get up at 5 a.m., clean the shit,

399
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,272
and work on the production line.

400
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,279
Who would be interested?

401
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,879
Who'd care?
- I would.

402
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,230
I can't do photos just for you.

403
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,235
Many people will be interested.
- If I go, let me finish,

404
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,752
if I go away, I can return with
things that people have never seen.

405
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,793
It would be better
to take pictures of

406
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,108
the guys you sleep with.

407
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,391
Sleep?

408
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,108
I fuck them. Would that be pretty?

409
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,278
Okay, it's not nice.

410
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,390
But why just show pretty things?

411
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,912
Romping lion cubs,
a sunset, a palm tree?

412
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,035
Why not say:
" I want to film my life "?

413
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,754
It would be...
- Take pictures of me.

414
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,719
Not that I want to be photographed

415
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,835
but there's feeling.
You know me better than anyone.

416
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,197
You could photograph
me better than anyone.

417
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,875
Take pictures of me, not of lions.

418
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,357
Okay. You're already a lioness!

419
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,670
I'll photograph you when you roar.

420
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,317
Hello.

421
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,349
Shall I suck you?

422
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,311
Now?

423
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,712
Yes.

424
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,712
- Slowly. What's the hurry?

425
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,032
I don't like wasting time.

426
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,550
- It's not good while driving.

427
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,155
- I like to be fucked

428
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,630
and be sucked.

429
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,035
- I like to suck, too.

430
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,473
- Caressing? Not really.

431
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,715
- A real slut.
- You could say that.

432
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,635
- There's a lot of meat in Lausanne,
so I don't often leave.

433
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,232
- I'm Fribourg meat.

434
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,436
- I'll have to taste.

435
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,590
- Are you pierced?

436
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,308
- Can't you see?

437
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,233
- Over the eye.
- That's not a piercing!

438
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,309
- It's all I've got.

439
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,472
Who would have thought!

440
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,075
Let me see.

441
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,835
Suck me.

442
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,350
Bitch!

443
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,079
God! The piercings!

444
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,956
Fuck!

445
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,109
I can't believe it.

446
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,872
I've got to take a photo.

447
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,194
2 piercings!

448
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,548
I've never seen that.

449
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,799
Maxi-Banana!

450
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,835
I don't believe it.

451
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,751
You fuck yourself?
- Yeah.

452
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,918
That's not for me.

453
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,036
You walk around with this,
at work and everything?

454
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,468
Well, you know

455
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,273
salesmen get bored
and have to pass the time.

456
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,269
That's really passing time!

457
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,995
This is quite unique!

458
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,388
To each his own.

459
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,348
Have you been to Paris?

460
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,396
I heard that they
fist fuck up to here.

461
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,795
- Some guys...

462
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,953
All the way to here.

463
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,076
And you?

464
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,517
- More or less

465
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,715
up to here.

466
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,119
- Mid-forearm.

467
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,352
Mid-forearm. Do you realise

468
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,517
that my forearm goes to there?

469
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,159
I'd touch your lungs.

470
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,228
I can't believe you did it.

471
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,552
So you slide it in gently.

472
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,274
- It goes up to there?
- No problem.

473
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,874
You have to prepare yourself.

474
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,479
- Of course...

475
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,468
- What's the best position
for fucking yourself with this?

476
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,393
I usually sit on it.

477
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,989
- I want to watch.

478
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,990
- Take it.

479
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,110
That's good.

480
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,000
I like to try different angles.

481
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,952
How do you like this one?

482
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,956
Cool, no?

483
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,915
- What's that?

484
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,434
Don't you see?

485
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,189
2 piercings.

486
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,469
2 piercings, just under his cock.

487
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,633
- Under his balls.

488
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,549
Under his balls.

489
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,553
I think it's real cool.

490
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,351
- You like it? It's an awful photo.
It's weird and really bizarre.

491
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,431
Don't you like it?

492
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,357
- I don't know. It's a bit clinical.

493
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,551
- It's a genre, but rather clinical.

494
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,069
- It seems a bit...

495
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,668
Everything I do is shit!

496
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,668
- I didn't say that.
- Everyone thinks so.

497
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,277
- Did you do it
for Marie or for you?

498
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,356
She told me to.

499
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,751
I enjoy taking pictures
of things we've never seen.

500
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,238
You've never seen that before.

501
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,511
You can't please everyone.

502
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,155
What do you think of me?

503
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,711
- How do you mean? Physically?

504
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,359
For a start.

505
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,232
- What's amusing is that

506
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,555
you have

507
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,836
a very angular head.

508
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,319
- Don't look at me like that.

509
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,033
You want to freak me out?

510
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,388
- Your head is very... Turn you head.

511
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,034
- Look at the sun.

512
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,034
- Look straight ahead.

513
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,995
- Your nose practically
makes a right angle.

514
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,993
- Almost a 90I angle.

515
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,029
That's awful.
- It's good. It's good.

516
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,590
- But your face is very angular.

517
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,435
What does angular mean?

518
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,194
- It means many angles.

519
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,279
Oh, yeah, lots of angles.
- The opposite of round.

520
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,954
- Your face is...

521
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,596
a little...

522
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,438
Like a Stealth Bomber.

523
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,832
- Like a Stealth Bomber.

524
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,639
Lot's of... I get it.

525
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,072
Do you like that?
- Don't you? It's nice, it's...

526
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,795
I don't often look in the mirror.

527
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,391
- Your profile is
like a Greek statue.

528
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,269
Cool.
- It's nice, no? You happy?

529
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,959
I never thought about it.

530
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,629
It's strange...

531
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,349
I expected... I don't know.
I didn't expect anything.

532
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,989
- Aren't you flattered?

533
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,798
- Stop playing the tortured soul.
You know you're a pretty boy.

534
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,029
What did you say?
- You're blushing. Your blushing.

535
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,159
- You know you're good looking.

536
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,591
- Playing with those seductive eyes!

537
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,358
No.
- That seductive look!

538
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,518
I've been told I have nice eyes
but not that I look Greek.

539
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,229
Is that why you're
here with me now?

540
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,714
To discover who I am?

541
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,275
- I'm discovering you now.
- That's true.

542
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,316
- You're showing me your castle...

543
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,239
My Castle! Shit!
It's Gruyere Castle.

544
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,593
I didn't build it nor create it
nor carry the heavy stones.

545
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,755
- I've seen your photos.

546
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,511
True.

547
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,839
He's nice but during
exams he's not the same.

548
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,635
He watched me like a hawk.
I got as red as a tomato.

549
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,629
Here's Loic.

550
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,671
Loic, this is Fred.
- Hello.

551
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,913
I'll be leaving.

552
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,788
See you tomorrow?
- Yes.

553
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,672
Happy?

554
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,551
Thanks.

555
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,833
You said that Bulle was once
part of National League "A".

556
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,114
You want to get
back into League "B".

557
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,392
Does Bulle have a role
to play in League "B"?

558
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,639
Yes, I think so.

559
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,514
Regionally speaking

560
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,389
Fribourg doesn't have
a National League team.

561
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,233
- There should be a team to represent

562
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,956
the canton.

563
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,796
- A team which could join
National League "A"or "B".

564
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,433
It could only be a plus for
the young people of the region.

565
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,199
- Playing for thousands of fans

566
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,838
in Portugal, then relatively few
here, is it hard to stay motivated?

567
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,553
- Yes, it makes a big difference.
And there's the climate.

568
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,231
- It's the first year I've trained
in below freezing weather.

569
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,273
- It's the first time.

570
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,392
- But it's also cold now
in Portugal, in France...

571
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,916
RUI ALVES: THE MULTI-LINGUAL
BALL OF ENERGY SPEAKS HIS MIND

572
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,790
- Closing time.

573
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,631
Bye-Bye.

574
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,596
We're closing.

575
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,597
- Lionel.

576
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,431
- Lionel.

577
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,515
Turn that off!

578
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,035
What's up?
- Come.

579
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:57,751
Get in here!

580
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,359
- What's your problem?

581
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,038
Suck me.

582
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,753
That's what you want!

583
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,837
You're a disgusting fake!

584
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,079
That's all you want!

585
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,236
My Greek profile! Bullshit!
Pig! It's all fake!

586
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,669
Bullshit!

587
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,959
You haven't been frank with me!

588
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,230
- Wait.

589
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,551
Queer!

590
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,709
- Where were you?

591
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:10,837
You crazy?

592
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,389
Where were you?

593
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,272
I took a walk.
- A walk!

594
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,119
Don't mock me! Liar!

595
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,032
I don't have to explain...

596
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,036
I followed you.

597
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,555
You were with the guy
from the museum.

598
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,668
He's so fat even I
wouldn't fuck him.

599
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,672
He ran his fingers
through your hair.

600
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,836
And then?
Did you fuck and suck him?

601
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,071
Do I ask what you do in bed?
- Shut up!

602
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,036
It's not the same.
He'll drop you.

603
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,350
How do you...
- Slut!

604
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,877
- You're digusting.
- Slut?

605
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,112
Out!

606
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,073
- That's it. Get out!

607
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,271
Do I ask you about the

608
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,039
sickening things you do?

609
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,231
Fuck off!

610
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,833
One doesn't follow people

611
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,549
in the streets.

612
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,079
You made me scream.

613
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,829
It's not good.

614
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,515
- Plug your ears.

615
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,036
It's not sordid.

616
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,952
It's simply someone to talk to.

617
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,439
But you wouldn't know.

618
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,192
You're only interested in yourself.

619
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,389
You're dirty.

620
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,749
You're the pig.

621
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,479
You go with anyone.

622
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,517
It's time.

623
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,356
- Well Loic,

624
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,469
I can't play mama anymore.

625
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,677
Nights like last night? No more!

626
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,512
I'm too old to babysit
and too young to play mom

627
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,753
to a 20 year old.

628
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,119
- I have goals.

629
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,468
Your life is a mess.

630
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,550
You try shocking me with your
stories. You think it works?

631
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,678
You think it shocks me?

632
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,108
It just makes me
feel sorry for you.

633
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,434
Do you even care?

634
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,989
- Do you understand?

635
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,672
We should stop seeing each other.

636
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,436
Completely.

637
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,515
I'm fed up watching you loaf around.

638
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,515
- It's depressing and unenriching.

639
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,714
Enough!

640
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,675
It's over!

641
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,951
LIONEL IS CALLING

642
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,918
5 UNANSWERED CALLS

643
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,598
MARIE IS CALLING

644
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,869
9 UNANSWERED CALLS

645
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,549
- Here's my Loic.

646
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,110
I'm not your Loic.

647
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:38,796
- Sorry.

648
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,473
- A strange place to meet!

649
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,472
Your kind of place, no?

650
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,189
- Let's sit down.

651
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,439
Okay. On the bench?

652
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,157
- So?

653
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,157
What?

654
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,636
- So?

655
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,157
Nothing!

656
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,790
- I'm glad to see you.
It's been awhile.

657
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,233
C'est la vie!

658
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,036
We can't see each all the time.

659
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,990
- The last time
we met it was a bit...

660
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,156
I had 5 minutes, so I called.

661
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,198
- 5 minutes!
- Precise!

662
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:22,512
I had to come to Lausanne.
Since we hadn't seen each other

663
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,789
I thought I'd call.

664
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,072
- What's going on in Lausanne?

665
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,271
It doesn't concern you.

666
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,149
What's this: ah, ah?

667
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,759
It's amazing how
many questions you ask.

668
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,790
- I'm interested in you.
- But why?

669
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,719
- I'm interested in you. I like you.

670
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,151
- In spite of what you think,
I don't want to sleep with you.

671
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,229
- You can be interested in someone
without wanting to fuck them.

672
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,868
You're laughing at me.
- I won't laugh.

673
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,470
Are you sure?
- Look. I'm not laughing.

674
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,269
- I won't laugh. I promise.

675
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,998
I've been following
a soccer player from Bulle.

676
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,074
- What do you mean?

677
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,956
I ran across an article
on him in the newspaper.

678
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,870
- And I went to see him play.

679
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,992
- He's well-known and
a really great player.

680
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,230
- What's his name?

681
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,792
- Rui Alves. You know him?
- No.

682
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,836
- He's great. And I don't know...

683
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,995
it's strange.

684
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,152
He interests me.

685
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,913
Rui interests me.

686
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,952
- He's a star! Everybody applauds
when he comes onto the field.

687
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,793
- He is the uncontested star
of the Bulle soccer team!

688
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,830
- I want to be famous like him.

689
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,869
- He's not great if he
plays for Switzerland.

690
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,159
- What did you say?

691
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,438
- Do you read the newpapers?

692
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,513
- You're in love.

693
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,191
- You say he's good-Iooking.

694
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,200
- I think you're in love.
- I'm not in love!

695
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,150
Idiot!

696
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,913
I'm not gay anymore.

697
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,352
- Not gay?
- Surprised?

698
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,917
- Just like that!
- Right.

699
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,390
Are you angry?

700
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,069
- I'm surprised.

701
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,392
I never have and never
will feel anythng for a man.

702
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,671
I know what I want
and that's it!

703
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,919
Look at Rui. He has a family.

704
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,231
He's healthy and intelligent.

705
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,036
I don't want to
spend my life fucking

706
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,951
nor live with some filthy man.

707
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,949
- All men aren't filthy.

708
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,199
Those I've met are.

709
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,753
- Did you look in
the right place?

710
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,190
- It's your life!

711
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,709
Do you want me to stay gay?

712
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,232
- Don't get upset.
I don't want you to stay gay.

713
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,712
But you said:
" Why not look for healthier men ".

714
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,150
" Not all men are filthy. "

715
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,553
- Because it seems to bother you.

716
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,554
You're pissed off
because you can't...

717
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,393
- We've discussed that.

718
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,075
It's clear that I'm no longer gay.

719
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,359
It was a bad phase.

720
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,798
- And things are better now?

721
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,830
- Calm down. I don't
want to freak you out.

722
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,276
- And your girlfriend?

723
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,755
We got in a big fight one night.
I called her every name in the book.

724
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,428
I spoke badly about her boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?

725
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:52,915
Yeah. Her boyfriend.

726
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,719
I said he was ugly.

727
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,913
That's not even true.

728
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,037
I hardly even looked at him.

729
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,079
Maybe he's okay.

730
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,032
- Why shouldn't she
have a boyfriend?

731
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,396
She'll stop taking care of me.
I can't stay with her as often.

732
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,273
- Have you spoken?
- No.

733
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,234
- Maybe you should.

734
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,469
- I don't know.

735
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,389
- You're suffering.

736
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,669
Maybe it's good, maybe it's bad.

737
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,472
Perhaps life decides.

738
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,150
Maybe life says:
" Loic and Marie are finished. "

739
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,717
And we must each go our own way.

740
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,077
- You can help life along.
It doesn't always know.

741
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,315
- Life makes mistakes.

742
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,272
- You can help it along.

743
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,953
I think that

744
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,595
given the situation,
seeing how things are going,

745
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,358
we shouldn't see each other.

746
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,635
It would be better.

747
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,473
I need to take distance
from certain things.

748
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:11,757
That's it.

749
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,230
- Shall we go?

750
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,757
- Come.

751
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,156
- Come on!

752
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,870
I wonder what's down there?

753
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,157
There's nothing. It's dark.

754
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,232
Come on! Come on!

755
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,873
- You'll get hurt!

756
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,871
- Come back! Marie!

757
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,035
- What's down there?

758
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,350
Nothing.

759
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:46,911
Excuse me.

760
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,076
- I'm Loic.

761
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,156
- Loic Muller.

762
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,590
- From Bulle.

763
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,389
- He's beautiful.

764
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,231
- His name is Noah.

765
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,990
- Your wife is Marisa.
- Right.

766
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,593
- There are many
articles on you.

767
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,356
- It's normal. You're the best.

768
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,236
- How do you know?

769
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,154
- I've seen you play.

770
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,309
- I know all about you.

771
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,475
- I'm a photographer.

772
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,673
- Photographer?
- Yes.

773
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,631
- How's that?

774
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,956
I take lots of pictures.

775
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,154
Impressionistic!
I'm an Impressionist.

776
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,759
- That's impressing!

777
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,036
I've taken pictures of you.
Want to see?

778
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:53,711
What?

779
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,116
What a goal! Incredible.

780
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,632
Look. With your head.
You often do that.

781
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,908
- You can call me Rui.

782
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,272
But I hardly know you.

783
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,315
Who's the girl?

784
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,595
- In that photo?

785
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,430
That's Marie.

786
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,070
My girlfriend.

787
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,915
- Where is she?

788
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,155
That's her at work

789
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,236
in Lausanne.

790
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,673
- I spend every weekend with her.

791
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,550
I sleep at her place.

792
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,032
We do things together.
- Like what?

793
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,112
Like normal couples.

794
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,550
- She likes to pose.

795
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,156
I hate it.

796
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,997
- Photographers tell lies.

797
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,150
I'm not a liar.

798
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,515
- Shall I delete?

799
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,354
Calm down. I'm coming.

800
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,716
What's happening?

801
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,629
- My eyes are burning. I can't see.
- Show me.

802
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,998
- They're not burnt, just irritated.

803
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,033
Shit! I can't believe it.

804
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:48,070
- We should have worn sun glasses.
- It's a little late!

805
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,514
- If something happens to Noah...
- Sorry.

806
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:52,835
...his mother will kill me.

807
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,599
- How will I get back?

808
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,717
I'm truly sorry. It my fault.

809
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,115
I made tea.

810
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,149
Thanks. And Noah?

811
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,196
Asleep in his playpen.

812
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,469
Your tea is here.

813
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,958
Are you there?
- Yes.

814
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,716
Good.

815
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,479
Should I be angry with you

816
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,190
about my eyes?

817
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,829
Or thank you for showing
me the mountains and

818
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,273
showing my son the snow?

819
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,391
- You spoke about soccer,
Bulle and being a star.

820
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,994
Those words frighten me because

821
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,999
I don't see it that way.

822
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,793
It's not important if

823
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,354
I'm not a star,

824
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,155
if you're not
a great photographer,

825
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,990
if I don't play
soccer all my life,

826
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,238
or stay in Bulle.

827
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,235
If I were a star,
as the papers say,

828
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,116
I wouldn't be playing
in League "B" for Bulle.

829
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,834
I'd be part of a
big European club.

830
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,395
- And if you were

831
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,636
a photographer you wouldn't
take pictures with a phone.

832
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,437
- It's not an accident we met.

833
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,194
- It was a chance in a million.

834
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:04,158
- I'm from Lisbon and you're
from Bulle, yet we have met.

835
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,629
- It's true and

836
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,355
it's not for nothing.

837
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,274
- It's not for nothing.

838
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:18,870
Thank you.

839
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,512
Can you hear me?

840
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,310
- All is well.

841
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,079
Marlyse is in the workshop.

842
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,919
A full withdrawal, please.

843
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:37,431
Shall I close?

844
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,069
Sign here.

845
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,797
Large bills or small?
- Large.

846
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:52,035
- 1,2,3,4,5.

847
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,591
Can I help?

848
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:16,750
I'd like a camera.

849
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,559
It depends on your needs.

850
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,674
If you're experienced,

851
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,751
if you want
to shoot your own films...

852
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:28,159
They all have night-shot,
auto-focus, steady-shot, etc.

853
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,153
Some have an in/out function,
which is fantastic.

854
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:38,034
You can stock images in your station,
if you're equiped for montage, etc.

855
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,199
No video recorder needed.

856
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:45,432
Of course, it costs more but
it's almost professional equipment.

857
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,195
And the one for 4,598?
- Let's look.

858
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,990
" OUR FIRST DUTY IS TO FEEL SHAME "

859
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,191
" BARRICADE OURSELVES "

860
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,793
" UNDER OUR FEET, PEACE "

861
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,513
" NO GOD, NO MASTER, NO PAPA "

862
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,634
What's it all about?

863
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,679
The dictionary can't define it all.

864
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,675
I must understand.

865
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,479
You're no longer here, Marie,
to explain globalisation,

866
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:07,150
Free States, G8, Tobin Tax,
underdeveloped countries, slavery...

867
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,032
but I will learn.

868
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,712
I don't know what I will be
but I know what I won't be.

869
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,718
I won't be anti-globalisation,
nor march with the masses,

870
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,436
nor cry " Kill Them ", nor be a cop,
nor sell out, nor be a hooligan,

871
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:25,236
nor neutral, nor reasonable,
nor a militant, nor a collaborator.

872
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:30,514
I won't fuck everyone, nor create a
family, sell ass, buy ass, have kids,

873
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:35,475
fear the dark, love the dark, be
a Christian, a Jew, a Buddhist,

874
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:40,310
not believe in people, be like
everyone, transparent, absent,

875
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:44,877
not look women straight in the eye,
fuck men rather than speak with them,

876
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,116
fuck everyone to avoid loving anyone.

877
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,039
I want to tell stories,
Marie, my own stories.

878
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,437
And no one will know if
they are real or fantasy.

879
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:57,513
I don't want to be a stupid boy.

880
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,559
I am not a stupid boy.
