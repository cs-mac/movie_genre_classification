1
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:33,518
<i>I remember taking the first dip in
the Oslo fjord on the first of May.</i>

2
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:38,398
<i>I remember driving into
Oslo on Sunday at sunset.</i>

3
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,278
<i>The city was completely empty.</i>

4
00:00:41,438 --> 00:00:46,798
<i>I remember how tall the trees seemed
compared to those in Northern Norway.</i>

5
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,518
<i>I remember thinking,
"I'll remember this."</i>

6
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:04,358
<i>I remember dad sitting
in the kitchen, smoking.</i>

7
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:08,838
<i>Drinking coffee,
listening to the radio.</i>

8
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:13,198
<i>I don't remember Oslo as such,
it's people I remember.</i>

9
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,160
<i>We moved to the city.
We felt extremely mature.</i>

10
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:22,838
<i>I remember hours on trams,
buses, the metro, -</i>

11
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:28,063
<i>- walking along endless roads
to some mythical party, -</i>

12
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,688
<i>- where you never knew whether
you were invited or not.</i>

13
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:35,913
<i>I remember how free I felt
the first time I came to Oslo.</i>

14
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:40,478
<i>Then I realised how small Oslo is.</i>

15
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:44,798
<i>I remember mom showing me where
she once rented a room.</i>

16
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:49,598
<i>- There's only offices there now.
- Every football match I've played, -</i>

17
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:54,278
<i>- was with friends I still have.
And that's because I'm from Oslo.</i>

18
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:58,678
<i>- I remember his laughter.
- The scent of salt on her skin.</i>

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,780
<i>Everyone was sure we'd win.
I remember the disappointment.</i>

20
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:06,998
<i>- I remember the first snow.
- Everyone smoked back then.</i>

21
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,238
<i>How he insisted "melancholy"
was cooler than "nostalgic".</i>

22
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,998
<i>We had so much time on our hands.</i>

23
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,280
<i>How my bed didn't fit into the flat.</i>

24
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:21,838
<i>- I remember walking past his flat.
- I remember having a best friend.</i>

25
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:28,158
<i>- It's a parking lot today.
- I never saw him again.</i>

26
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:31,018
<i>I remember when they
tore down the Philips building.</i>

27
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,518
- Getting high on food now, Gisle?
- Shut up.

28
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:11,678
And I never had that feeling
when I went out before.

29
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:16,878
But I do now, and I don't know why.
Because I've been doing great here.

30
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:20,603
But the last month or two, -

31
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:24,028
I've really started to worry.

32
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:27,953
Because...
Well, I'm scared shitless.

33
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:30,378
Scared of the future?

34
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:35,238
It's like I'm right back to
when I started doing drugs.

35
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:38,763
As if I'm back in primary school
emotionally.

36
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:43,638
That black...

37
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:47,678
Void, or...

38
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,958
It's like it's back.

39
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:53,198
And the relief -

40
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:56,038
- from shooting up is gone.

41
00:09:58,063 --> 00:10:02,963
So I have serious doubts
about how I'm going to live now.

42
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:06,158
How to live with it.

43
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:10,398
Thanks.

44
00:10:11,158 --> 00:10:14,118
The past days I haven't had any...

45
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:18,278
I haven't had strong
feelings in any direction.

46
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:22,958
I feel tired, but that's
because I haven't slept well.

47
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:27,718
- You've got a big job interview today.
- Yeah.

48
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,718
Would you like to talk about it?

49
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:35,978
Well, there's not much to talk about.

50
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:10,678
This is for the return trip. Remember
to tell them to enter via Losbyveien.

51
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:15,278
Taxis from Oslo always have
trouble finding us out here.

52
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:18,438
I'll see you back here later.

53
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,958
Goodbye and good luck.

54
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,958
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, it's Anders.</i>

55
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,758
<i>Wow. Hi, Anders. Come in.</i>

56
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,158
You see who's here?

57
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:14,378
Hi.

58
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:17,658
Remember me?

59
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:24,838
- I was just in the neighbourhood.
- Cool. Come in.

60
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:28,278
- Is this a bad time?
- No, not at all.

61
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:32,398
Long time no see.

62
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:37,398
- Want some coffee, Anders?
- Yeah, sure.

63
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:42,958
We have drinking-yoghurt,
juice, beer. Want a beer?

64
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:45,183
No, coffee will be fine.

65
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:48,998
Thanks.

66
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,978
You're having beer?
He doesn't usually drink at lunch.

67
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,703
He's acting tough in front of you.

68
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:01,928
Yeah, I'm a real tough guy.

69
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:05,301
So you can't drink, is that it?

70
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:06,638
No, but it's fine.

71
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:09,733
Get off your face!

72
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:16,038
You've completed the program?

73
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,438
I've got two more weeks,
then I'm done.

74
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:23,238
- You think it's helped?
- Well...

75
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:26,118
- Is that a troll?
- I guess so.

76
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,198
Why did you draw a troll?

77
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:33,758
- You're looking at Anders?
- Because he's so tall.

78
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:37,878
You think so?
Anders used to be a drug troll.

79
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:42,238
Have you heard about heroin
and speed and so on? Or khat?

80
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:44,918
- You've heard of "cat"?
- Yes.

81
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:50,958
Daddy used to party with
Anders sometimes.

82
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:56,838
But now I have to be here with
you and mom, which is really nice.

83
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:59,758
You want to give him the drawing?

84
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:03,718
- Is it for me? thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

85
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,238
She seems to like you.

86
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:13,958
There's this guy at the home, -

87
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:17,678
- some pitiful junky,
who had to play Thomas.

88
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:22,598
- What do you mean?
- We do role playing, psychodrama.

89
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:28,478
It's part of the treatment.
The other residents play people -

90
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:32,258
- in my life, like my sister or you.

91
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:34,183
So a dopehead plays me?

92
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:38,798
"A dopehead." So how's it done?

93
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,638
Well, you have to improvise.

94
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:46,278
They stand in a circle, try
to tempt me with stuff.

95
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:54,917
"Anders, remember how the dope
makes you feel warm inside."

96
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:59,018
"You can just smoke it,
no need to shoot up."

97
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:02,518
Well, stuff like that, you know.

98
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:07,318
And... But the guys who played
you, didn't have much to...

99
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:10,918
- Not much to go on?
- No relevant experience.

100
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:15,198
They were suppose to tempt
me with academic stuff.

101
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,718
But they had no idea.

102
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:23,998
"I've got a really awesome book here,
a really cool book. Adorno..."

103
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:30,318
- Seems they captured my complexity.
- He tempted me with his academia.

104
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:33,038
I can't believe you fell for it.

105
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:42,078
Well, it always ends the same
way, with the same words:

106
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:45,278
"I love you, Anders. I forgive you."

107
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,038
Like it's something they all
think they need to hear.

108
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:00,718
But enough of that.

109
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:04,518
- You look well.
- You think so?

110
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:08,798
I didn't get much sleep last night.

111
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,280
I had my first so-called
"evening leave".

112
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:18,118
I met Malin.
She's moving to Stockholm.

113
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:21,118
- Malin? Do I know her?
- How could you?

114
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:24,998
Anders pulls so many women
you can't keep track.

115
00:17:26,598 --> 00:17:31,078
- I don't think you've met.
- Here I am, feeling sorry for you.

116
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:35,838
Looking so tired. But you've just
been hustling Swedish chicks.

117
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:38,118
I don't know.

118
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:42,398
I wasn't quite there.

119
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,078
Maybe I expected too much.

120
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,198
I felt nothing.

121
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:54,318
Proust said, "Trying to understand
desire by watching a nude woman" -

122
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:58,558
- " is like a child taking apart
a clock to understand time."

123
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:04,518
Jeez. He's trying to be personal,
and you hit him with a quote!

124
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:08,398
So if he's personal, I
have to be personal too?

125
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,678
But it's been ages since I
slept with a Swedish chick.

126
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:16,758
But his point was the opposite
of your Proust quote.

127
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:19,838
He said he didn't feel any desire.

128
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,198
At least listen to what he's saying.

129
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:27,598
Sure, but... Proust is Proust.

130
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,638
Ring the buzzer and I'll
help you with the groceries.

131
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,238
Sorry.

132
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:38,918
It's crazy.

133
00:18:39,878 --> 00:18:44,638
Excuse me, have you seen
Albert's teething ring?

134
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,318
- No, I can't remember. I don't know.
- Okay.

135
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,758
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

136
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:58,638
Oh, shit. Rebecca?

137
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,358
- Check the fridge door.
- Right. Thanks.

138
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,638
He's getting his teeth.

139
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:10,478
He needs something cool
to soothe his gums.

140
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:12,998
Welcome to my life.

141
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:19,278
I saw your parents the other day.
In the Frogner Park.

142
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:24,918
They still seem so much in love,
attentive, like a model couple.

143
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:29,878
- They're selling the house, you know.
- Selling Fagerborg? Why?

144
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:33,838
Well, they had to borrow
a great deal of money.

145
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:39,198
I've fucked up so bad
financially, you have no idea.

146
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:42,358
Dad said they planned
to sell it anyway.

147
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:47,758
To travel more when they retired.
They're in Nice now, actually.

148
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,198
So what's the deal?
Are you just out for a spell?

149
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,798
I'm meeting my sister later, and...

150
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:02,878
I've actually got a job interview.

151
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,998
A job interview? Cool.

152
00:20:06,158 --> 00:20:08,758
Well, I don't know.

153
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:14,478
It's just temporary.
Editorial assistant at Folio.

154
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:17,078
But that's cool!

155
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:22,918
No, it's not. I had to apply as part
of the program they stuck me in.

156
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:26,118
No, that's awesome. Like...

157
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:32,558
I mean, if you get a foothold there,
you'll end up as editor in no time.

158
00:20:32,718 --> 00:20:34,838
Hey, cut the crap.

159
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:41,358
- You're much smarter than them.
- I'm not.

160
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:46,318
What about the articles you wrote?
- That was six years ago!

161
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:52,198
And only because I was partying
with Knut, not because I could write.

162
00:21:03,358 --> 00:21:07,558
I often worried that something
might happen to you.

163
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,118
That someone would call
and say, "Anders OD'd."

164
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,638
When Iselin left -

165
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,358
- I was almost certain that was it.

166
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:23,718
"I'll lose Anders."

167
00:21:25,398 --> 00:21:28,438
I guess I distanced myself from you.

168
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:33,398
Why not go back to Iselin?

169
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:39,198
I think...

170
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,118
She doesn't want to talk to me.

171
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:55,918
Don't you think things have changed?

172
00:21:57,438 --> 00:22:02,558
Iselin is strong. She kept calling
me whenever you disappeared.

173
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:05,278
Asked me to help look for you.

174
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:08,838
I must admit I gave up after a while.

175
00:22:08,998 --> 00:22:11,438
But Iselin never gave up.

176
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,478
Yeah, but there you have it.
She doesn't mean enough to me.

177
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:20,438
I looked forward to meeting Malin.

178
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:25,358
But when I saw her, I'd no idea
what I'd made such a fuss about.

179
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,678
Iselin is different. You loved her.

180
00:22:29,838 --> 00:22:31,638
No, I didn't.

181
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:37,478
Don't be stupid.
You were crazy about her.

182
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,158
That was when I started shooting up.

183
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:49,838
Like, I got some money today.

184
00:22:49,998 --> 00:22:53,998
My first thought was
to use it for heroin.

185
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:58,318
It just instinctively
popped into my mind.

186
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:01,118
Going back there isn't an option.

187
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:04,478
It's a reflex.
It doesn't mean you'll do it.

188
00:23:04,638 --> 00:23:08,238
But it's not about heroin, not really.

189
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:11,878
Look at me. I'm 34 years old.
I have nothing.

190
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:18,518
I can't start from scratch.
Don't you understand?

191
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:22,318
- I know it's not easy...
- I don't want pity.

192
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:26,838
I know that.
I'm just saying you can still make it.

193
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:29,958
- Make what?
- Lots of stuff.

194
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:35,838
You've got a family to back you up,
friends, brains. Like, come on!

195
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:40,318
Look at the others at rehab.

196
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:43,678
They don't have those opportunities.

197
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:48,198
Sure, but they're happy.

198
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:52,638
- To work in a warehouse and
have kids with some ex-raver.

199
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,198
- Be a loser, if that's what you want.
- No it's not what I want.

200
00:23:57,358 --> 00:24:00,198
Fuck, I didn't come here to...

201
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:04,318
I don't need you to tell
me to get my act together.

202
00:24:04,478 --> 00:24:08,878
- So I'm way out of line?
- No you're not. Sorry.

203
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:19,758
Remember what you once said?

204
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:26,398
"If someone wants to destroy himself,
society should allow him to do so."

205
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:29,398
Sounds like something I'd say.

206
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:34,798
I was probably thinking about
advertising junk food, or -

207
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:40,398
- criminalizing prostitution.
I don't know. But you're not...

208
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:43,723
I'm a spoilt brat who fucked up.

209
00:24:44,158 --> 00:24:49,278
If you're unsentimental about it,
nobody needs me. Not really.

210
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:53,918
You expect me to be
unsentimental about this?

211
00:24:57,518 --> 00:24:59,958
No.

212
00:25:00,118 --> 00:25:02,558
I'm just trying to...

213
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:12,478
I just want you to understand.

214
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:17,078
If that's how it ends,
it's a choice I've made.

215
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:22,358
But you can't go telling me that.
That's horrible, Anders.

216
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:28,038
I mean, you mustn't do it,
no matter what happens.

217
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:33,998
I can't relate to you telling me
you're planning to commit suicide.

218
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,878
Is that what you're saying?

219
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,878
What do you think it'll
do to your parents?

220
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:47,198
I don't know. They'd assume it's an OD.
Happens all the time.

221
00:25:57,158 --> 00:26:02,358
You've had these thoughts before.
They've always passed.

222
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:06,178
It's hell while it lasts, but...

223
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,338
It'll get better.

224
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:09,425
Everything will be fine.

225
00:26:13,478 --> 00:26:15,438
Except it won't.

226
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:31,438
Oh, come on.

227
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:34,158
Come on what?

228
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:37,318
You got through it before.

229
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:48,143
I mean, if you have to look
at your life from the outside...

230
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,318
If you have the time, like you have,

231
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:55,118
I think anyone would get depressed.

232
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:56,998
Well, maybe.

233
00:26:57,798 --> 00:27:03,278
But it's pretty fucked up.
I see happy people.

234
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:07,358
I've always thought happy
people must be morons.

235
00:27:07,518 --> 00:27:09,478
<i>They are morons.</i>

236
00:27:10,718 --> 00:27:12,598
Obviously.

237
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,398
Yeah.

238
00:27:17,358 --> 00:27:19,438
But you two are happy.

239
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:23,598
And you're not morons, are you?

240
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:27,678
Sometimes I wonder.
It's like, "What are we doing?"

241
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:34,758
And "happy" would probably be
to exaggerate. But it's okay.

242
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:38,318
You could get there, if
that's what you want.

243
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:43,638
Well, it's not like I
want to live your life.

244
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:46,878
I mean...

245
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,198
I don't want kids.
They're cute enough, but...

246
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:54,798
- Is that what it takes?
- No.

247
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:57,278
And research is your thing.

248
00:27:57,438 --> 00:28:02,558
I never thought it was that
thrilling to scrutinise Rilke, -

249
00:28:02,718 --> 00:28:06,678
- dissect sentences, write
articles nobody reads.

250
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:11,398
- It seems meaningless to me.
- Well, there goes my existence.

251
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,278
- Is that how you see my life?
- Hey...

252
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:21,318
Sorry. I just... I only meant to say...

253
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:23,878
You're good at all that.

254
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:28,438
My head is bursting with trivialities.

255
00:28:28,598 --> 00:28:33,238
I can't sort them out.
My back is a mess.

256
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:36,118
Probably from sitting too much.

257
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:41,118
And now I'm caught up in renovating
the flats where we live.

258
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,558
The other owners just
dump everything on me.

259
00:28:44,718 --> 00:28:50,718
I've got two upcoming lectures that
I've got to start preparing, one -

260
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:53,358
- on Wergeland's tenure as
Keeper of the National Archives.

261
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:56,040
"God looks after antiquities"
- Jesus!

262
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,718
Yeah, it sucks. I can't
focus on anything.

263
00:28:59,878 --> 00:29:04,198
Rebekka and I hardly have sex anymore.
Not at all, really.

264
00:29:04,358 --> 00:29:07,918
To top it all, Albert's
got some kind of rash, -

265
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:13,598
- and I have to find an ointment.
It's like... I don't know.

266
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:20,238
I can't even choose my own company.
Just people with kids that Julia likes.

267
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,158
And that's not many.

268
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:25,718
So there we sit,
pretending to have fun.

269
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:29,438
Two glasses of wine.
That's as good as it gets.

270
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:31,678
Frigging pathetic.

271
00:29:34,158 --> 00:29:37,598
After Albert came,
I hoped to start writing.

272
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:41,838
But I haven't done shit.
Rebekka and I hardly talk anymore.

273
00:29:41,998 --> 00:29:47,598
<i>I got a Playstation. We sit and
play Battlefield. Drink beer.</i>

274
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:52,798
We accept some invitations, then
decide we'd rather stay at home.

275
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,318
We tell the babysitter
something's come up.

276
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:59,478
We sit there, playing Battlefield.

277
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:04,838
And Rebecca is really brutal.
Takes dog tags from other players -

278
00:30:04,998 --> 00:30:09,038
- then destroys them to
humiliate them properly.

279
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:11,838
And that's like the best part.

280
00:30:16,078 --> 00:30:18,238
What a life.

281
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:20,438
Sorry, I had to laugh.

282
00:30:24,493 --> 00:30:27,693
Want to wait for your sister
at my place?

283
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:31,418
- I should go to the job interview.
- Really?

284
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:34,263
Why not? It'll probably
be a disaster.

285
00:30:35,588 --> 00:30:37,788
But I have to rush. It's at two.

286
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:41,878
- Want me to walk with you?
- No, I'll be okay.

287
00:30:42,878 --> 00:30:47,798
Join us for dinner.
Calle and Mirjam are having a party.

288
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:49,823
They'd love to see you.

289
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,718
I don't think so.

290
00:30:57,518 --> 00:31:01,478
Now don't do anything stupid.
Or you'll really piss me off.

291
00:31:01,638 --> 00:31:03,758
- Promise?
- I promise.

292
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,798
Come to the party. And...

293
00:31:12,878 --> 00:31:17,558
Give my regards to your sister.
Good luck with the job interview.

294
00:31:19,598 --> 00:31:21,198
Bye.

295
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:30,278
Hi, Iselin. It's Anders.

296
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:34,798
Well, I know it's late
where you are, but...

297
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:39,518
You probably don't want to talk to me.
I've got a new number.

298
00:32:39,678 --> 00:32:42,478
So if there's anything...

299
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:46,798
Please call me when you hear this.

300
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:49,918
It's 98545376.

301
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:58,078
Right. It's kind of important,
so if you...

302
00:32:58,238 --> 00:33:02,038
I'd really like to talk to you.
Okay. Bye.

303
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:33,398
Excuse me?

304
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:39,958
David Molvaer, is he here? It's about
the editorial assistant position.

305
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:41,318
David!

306
00:33:49,198 --> 00:33:51,798
Do you read our publication?

307
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:56,198
- Yeah.
- Well, go on, what do you think?

308
00:33:58,158 --> 00:34:00,638
I like it. Uh...

309
00:34:01,678 --> 00:34:06,118
I think the last couple of
issues show great improvement.

310
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,878
I like the new layout.

311
00:34:09,726 --> 00:34:10,726
So?

312
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:14,373
But being absolutely honest,
I think...

313
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:19,158
You're still a little too...

314
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:23,998
- Your profile is perhaps a bit vague.
- In what way?

315
00:34:24,158 --> 00:34:29,958
Well, you're very similar to Vinduet,
which makes it hard to be distinctive.

316
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:33,278
Specially when they're
better in some areas.

317
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,918
- Really? Like what?
- You do many things well.

318
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:42,398
But take the article on Mad Men
and The Man Without Qualities.

319
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:47,158
It's not a bad idea as such.
But there are many of these -

320
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:53,278
- intellectual articles on HBO
TV series and video games.

321
00:34:53,918 --> 00:35:00,118
It feels a bit like a media studies
paper. You know what I mean?

322
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:05,718
Samantha in Sex in the City
seen through Schopenhauer.

323
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:10,758
People want something a bit
lighter to read as well.

324
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:15,058
But the articles still
have to be well written.

325
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:20,558
In the long term I hope to publish
an English-language version.

326
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:25,438
We'd lose our state subsidy, but
targetting the English-speaking market

327
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:28,158
- would allow us to specialise.

328
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:30,918
That sounds great.

329
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:35,638
My girlfriend works in New York,
so I have some contacts there.

330
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:41,358
- You've written for the Morning Post?
- Yeah.

331
00:35:42,078 --> 00:35:45,638
- You write well.
- You think so?

332
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:47,798
Thanks.

333
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:51,638
But when I look at your CV, -

334
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:55,038
- there's almost nothing after 2005.

335
00:35:56,038 --> 00:36:00,678
Well, there wasn't anything I
thought would be relevant.

336
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:03,878
Everything's relevant to us.

337
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:07,058
So what were you doing?

338
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,259
I worked as a DJ for a while...

339
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:16,398
- Did some odd jobs from time to time.
- Okay. Like what?

340
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:20,598
- You really want to know?
- Of course.

341
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,878
I was a drug addict.

342
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:36,278
Okay. But...

343
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:40,558
- What kind of drug addict?
- Just about anything.

344
00:36:40,718 --> 00:36:44,638
Cocaine, ecstasy, alcohol...

345
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:50,478
Heroin as well.

346
00:36:50,638 --> 00:36:54,358
I was dealing a bit as well.
Should I put that on my CV?

347
00:37:00,278 --> 00:37:04,998
But I'm clean now. I haven't even
had a beer in almost ten months.

348
00:37:07,078 --> 00:37:09,558
So I'm completely clean now.

349
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:14,518
Yeah, that's...

350
00:37:14,678 --> 00:37:19,358
Not many people manage to get
through that. So that's...

351
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:21,718
Extraordinary.

352
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:27,878
Hey, Let's just forget it.

353
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:32,078
- Just hand it over.
- What do you mean?

354
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:36,478
- My application.
- May we keep it? I could...

355
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:38,718
No, I'll take it.

356
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,998
I don't get it.

357
00:37:44,998 --> 00:37:48,318
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

358
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:41,478
<i>I play the piano.</i>

359
00:38:41,638 --> 00:38:44,638
<i>Me too. But I'm not that good.</i>

360
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:49,278
<i>- Okay. So what do you play?
- A bit like...</i>

361
00:38:49,438 --> 00:38:53,678
- Stuff like "Fur Elise".
- Classical?

362
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,438
- And you?
- Not classical. It's more...

363
00:38:57,598 --> 00:39:01,238
<i>Improvised jazz.
I hate practising.</i>

364
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:04,598
<i>There was all this pressure on him.</i>

365
00:39:05,198 --> 00:39:07,398
It was hard. Absolutely.

366
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:11,118
Many people have a hard
time, but what he did...

367
00:39:11,278 --> 00:39:15,758
- He went too far,
- Too much money, too much...

368
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:19,598
The kids from her group
got kindergarten places.

369
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:25,318
We'll probably get places too, but
with one kid at one centre and...

370
00:39:25,478 --> 00:39:27,438
I know.

371
00:39:32,598 --> 00:39:36,918
- He's got a great singing voice.
- Not any longer.

372
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:38,958
Not since he shot himself.

373
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:43,758
If you're going to shoot
yourself, don't use a shotgun!

374
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:47,118
No, his voice isn't quite the same.

375
00:39:47,278 --> 00:39:49,758
Not since he shot himself.

376
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:52,598
Blew his head off, like "splat".

377
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:00,878
I didn't know what to do.
Can hardly speak when he's like that.

378
00:40:01,038 --> 00:40:03,598
He said so, just like that?

379
00:40:05,558 --> 00:40:10,678
Yesterday, when we were
brushing our teeth, he went...

380
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:13,358
He didn't say so directly.

381
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:20,238
<i>He started going on about how he
isn't sure how he feels about us.</i>

382
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:24,998
<i>Or if he wants to be with me.
Then he says he wants to.</i>

383
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:28,598
<i>But that...
He starts going like...</i>

384
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:32,278
<i>That he doesn't know
what he feels?</i>

385
00:40:33,278 --> 00:40:35,158
<i>Yeah, or...</i>

386
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:38,798
<i>- About what? You?
- About me, and...</i>

387
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:47,638
<i>I want to marry, have kids.
Travel the world. Buy a house.</i>

388
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:51,478
<i>Have romantic holidays.
Eat only ice cream for a day.</i>

389
00:40:51,638 --> 00:40:55,278
Live abroad.
Reach and maintain my ideal weight.

390
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:59,838
Write a great novel.
Stay in touch with old friends.

391
00:40:59,998 --> 00:41:04,678
I want to plant a tree.
Make a delicious dinner from scratch.

392
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:07,158
Feel completely successful.

393
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:13,038
Go ice bathing, swim with dolphins.
Have a birthday party, a proper one.

394
00:41:13,198 --> 00:41:17,398
Live to be a hundred.
Stay married until I die.

395
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:23,438
<i>Send an exciting message in a bottle
and get an equally interesting reply.</i>

396
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:28,638
<i>Overcome all my fears and phobias.
Lie watching the clouds all day.</i>

397
00:41:28,798 --> 00:41:33,598
<i>Have an old house full of knick-knacks.
Run a full marathon.</i>

398
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:38,918
<i>Read a book that's so great I'll
remember quotes from it all my life.</i>

399
00:41:39,078 --> 00:41:43,278
<i>Paint stunning pictures
that show how I really feel.</i>

400
00:41:43,438 --> 00:41:47,398
<i>Cover a wall with paintings
and words close to my heart.</i>

401
00:41:47,558 --> 00:41:50,798
<i>Own all the seasons
of my favourite shows.</i>

402
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:55,918
Attract attention to an important
issue, make people listen to me.

403
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:59,838
Go skydiving, skinny-dipping,
fly a helicopter.

404
00:41:59,998 --> 00:42:03,318
Have a good job I look
forward to every day.

405
00:42:03,478 --> 00:42:08,158
I want a romantic, unique proposal.
Sleep beneath open skies.

406
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,678
Hike on Besseggen, act in a film
or play at the National Theatre.

407
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,598
Win a fortune in the lottery.
Make useful everyday items.

408
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:20,758
And be loved.

409
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:21,238
- Hi, Anders.
- Hi. Where's Nina?

410
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:24,278
Well, she's stuck in a meeting.

411
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:32,438
Some Foreign Affairs thing.
She asked me to come.

412
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:37,158
- So she's not coming?
- No, I don't think so.

413
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,438
I'll take you there.
I've got the keys.

414
00:43:42,198 --> 00:43:47,398
<i>- A Pepsi Max and a bruschetta.
- One brushetta.</i>

415
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,638
I'm good.

416
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:57,998
You pronounced it correctly.
Everyone says "brushetta".

417
00:43:58,158 --> 00:44:01,958
They correct you
if you pronounce it right.

418
00:44:03,598 --> 00:44:07,198
- Didn't know you were back together.
- You didn't?

419
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,198
Well, it's been a while now.

420
00:44:13,598 --> 00:44:17,678
Nina wanted to know how
the job interview went.

421
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:20,638
I'd rather tell her myself.

422
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:24,238
Could you text her,
ask if she'll make it?

423
00:44:31,078 --> 00:44:33,518
You know, Nina's...

424
00:44:35,398 --> 00:44:39,398
Nina's a bit worried now
that you're back outside.

425
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:41,718
Okay.

426
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:46,678
She saw herself sitting here,
you not showing up, and...

427
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:49,638
She just needs time.

428
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:55,038
You mean she doesn't want to see me?

429
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:57,198
No, that's not it.

430
00:44:57,358 --> 00:44:59,958
But you've talked about it?

431
00:45:01,038 --> 00:45:05,558
She waited for you all yesterday.
Then suddenly you cancel.

432
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:10,718
Yes, but I didn't get evening leave.
I said so. Is that my fault?

433
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,078
What's her number again?

434
00:45:20,598 --> 00:45:24,558
What's her number?
Do I have to go there myself?

435
00:45:24,718 --> 00:45:28,158
No, don't. Nina isn't there.

436
00:45:28,638 --> 00:45:33,918
Nina's at home. She'll probably
stay there a few more days.

437
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,958
You'll be out soon,
and that's not easy for her.

438
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:43,438
I hope you understand.

439
00:45:46,638 --> 00:45:49,398
But she's really proud of you.

440
00:45:49,558 --> 00:45:52,118
That you've come through this.

441
00:45:52,278 --> 00:45:54,758
She just needs time.

442
00:45:57,438 --> 00:45:59,478
Here you go.

443
00:46:05,678 --> 00:46:11,118
I just think... Nina has had too
much family to cope with lately.

444
00:46:11,278 --> 00:46:15,798
Your Mom has been coming
by with stuff all summer.

445
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:19,878
- What sort of stuff?
- Most recently that big red painting.

446
00:46:20,038 --> 00:46:23,558
- The one above the sofa?
- She made Nina take it.

447
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:28,038
It's your mom's favourite.
Why can't she just keep it?

448
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:30,638
They still have plenty of room.

449
00:46:30,798 --> 00:46:34,958
Nina doesn't care
that they're selling the house.

450
00:46:35,118 --> 00:46:37,118
What do you mean?

451
00:46:37,278 --> 00:46:40,038
She's happy if they can help you.

452
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:43,518
She doesn't need
them to give her stuff.

453
00:46:46,038 --> 00:46:49,758
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing, just...

454
00:46:49,918 --> 00:46:52,678
- Sorry, this is too much.
- Excuse me?

455
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:55,398
I know your parents are fucked-up.

456
00:46:55,558 --> 00:47:00,598
But my issues are my fault.
It's got nothing to do with them.

457
00:47:00,758 --> 00:47:02,878
That came out wrong.

458
00:47:10,438 --> 00:47:12,798
I should be going.

459
00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:17,918
- May we have the check?
- I'll drive you to Fagersborg.

460
00:47:18,078 --> 00:47:23,398
No, don't bother. I'll walk.
Just give me the keys.

461
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:33,438
Okay, but Nina would like...
She wants me to go with you.

462
00:47:37,518 --> 00:47:41,838
- To escort me to my family home?
- Yes.

463
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:44,718
Oh dear. I'm sorry.

464
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:47,398
Who came up with that idea?

465
00:47:55,918 --> 00:48:00,678
- Don't. I'm the one who...
- Relax. No problem.

466
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:03,918
- But I don't want to...
- But I do.

467
00:48:04,078 --> 00:48:06,558
Give my regards to Nina.

468
00:48:47,278 --> 00:48:54,078
<i>He taught me to bike, row, how you
can exceed the speed limit by 20% -</i>

469
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:58,678
<i>- without getting busted.
60 at 50, 108 at 90.</i>

470
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:02,238
<i>She spoke of adult matters
in English.</i>

471
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:07,838
<i>She taught me to always floss.
To put things back where they belong.</i>

472
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:16,158
<i>They hated reactionaries, but
waited years before buying a VCR.</i>

473
00:49:17,558 --> 00:49:21,758
<i>They ware both from Oslo.
Remembered places we passed.</i>

474
00:49:24,678 --> 00:49:28,038
<i>Slightly deaf, he insisted
on hearing the absurd:</i>

475
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:31,758
<i>"What do you think is best?"
"Got waffles on your chest?"</i>

476
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:38,798
<i>They thought intellectual achievement
was superior to sports success.</i>

477
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:45,398
<i>They were sympathetic to celebrities
who protected their privacy.</i>

478
00:50:14,158 --> 00:50:20,678
<i>They made me a critical reader,
contemptuous of the less eloquent.</i>

479
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:24,398
<i>But anyone I brought home
got a warm welcome.</i>

480
00:50:24,558 --> 00:50:27,198
<i>They never missed
the evening news.</i>

481
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:33,118
<i>He took a test, then proudly told
us he had an artistic personality.</i>

482
00:50:33,278 --> 00:50:37,758
<i>He said people who valued
military experience were dull.</i>

483
00:50:39,318 --> 00:50:45,118
<i>She held a tolerant view on drugs.
He wanted to ban barbecuing in parks.</i>

484
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:48,158
<i>Democracy was just
the best alternative.</i>

485
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:53,318
<i>She thought Bardot should
help people, not animals.</i>

486
00:50:54,118 --> 00:50:58,678
<i>They respected my privacy.
Maybe too much.</i>

487
00:50:58,703 --> 00:51:02,803
<i>They taught me religion is
a weakness. I don't know if I agree.</i>

488
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:06,878
<i>They never taught me to cook
or build a relationship, -</i>

489
00:51:07,038 --> 00:51:12,078
<i>- but they seemed happy. They never
told me how friendship dissolves.</i>

490
00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:16,238
<i>Until you're strangers,
friends in name only.</i>

491
00:51:16,398 --> 00:51:21,238
<i>They let me be picky about food.
She said I could do as I wished.</i>

492
00:51:21,398 --> 00:51:25,278
<i>Decide what to be,
who to love, where to live.</i>

493
00:51:26,438 --> 00:51:32,398
<i>They would always help me. They were
stricter with my sister than with me.</i>

494
00:52:27,918 --> 00:52:29,878
Thanks.

495
00:52:33,758 --> 00:52:36,958
- You look good.
- Likewise.

496
00:52:37,118 --> 00:52:41,238
Hi. Happy birthday.
You look fabulous.

497
00:52:43,558 --> 00:52:45,798
- Hi, Mirjam.
- Hi.

498
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:49,398
- Put it in the kitchen?
- Yeah, sure.

499
00:52:49,558 --> 00:52:54,358
Hi. Wow. Good to see you.
It's been a long time.

500
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:58,318
- I'm meeting Thomas here.
- They haven't come yet.

501
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:06,918
You're gorgeous.

502
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:10,798
Just go upstairs and grab a drink.
Calle's there.

503
00:54:19,638 --> 00:54:22,798
Weren't you going to Bergen?

504
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:27,038
Yeah, I was.
I've lived there for like four years.

505
00:54:31,278 --> 00:54:34,118
Moved home a couple of months ago.

506
00:54:34,278 --> 00:54:37,358
- So you're living in Oslo now?
- Yeah.

507
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,798
I'm here, but what am I doing?

508
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:45,118
I think I'm trying to remember
what I was supposed to do.

509
00:54:45,278 --> 00:54:46,678
Yeah.

510
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:48,998
Anders? Anders!

511
00:54:51,278 --> 00:54:56,398
Tell us about the time you slept
with Mirjam's dad.

512
00:54:56,558 --> 00:55:00,558
- I didn't sleep with him.
- It's way back.

513
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:02,798
Ancient history.

514
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:08,598
I was at Mirjam's place.
It was late. We were pretty drunk.

515
00:55:08,758 --> 00:55:11,318
I had to use the bathroom.

516
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:17,958
I must've taken a wrong turn and
found myself in a dark room...

517
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:23,878
But the funny part is that
you ended up in bed with her dad.

518
00:55:24,038 --> 00:55:27,958
Yeah, because I just
stumbled in and collapsed.

519
00:55:29,518 --> 00:55:31,358
Right beside...

520
00:55:31,518 --> 00:55:35,758
Yeah, then I saw Mirjam's
father lying beside me.

521
00:55:35,918 --> 00:55:38,998
Right, but the punchline is...

522
00:55:39,158 --> 00:55:44,318
Anders is lying in bed with her dad.
Just looking at him.

523
00:55:44,478 --> 00:55:49,638
Being the cool cat he is, he goes,
"Relax. It's just a dream."

524
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:56,998
So where was her mother?

525
00:55:57,158 --> 00:56:01,998
Who cares? The story's about
Mirjam's father and Anders.

526
00:56:04,078 --> 00:56:09,438
- So you and Mirjam were together?
- No, no. He was with her dad.

527
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:28,118
Hey, are you leaving?

528
00:56:28,278 --> 00:56:30,118
Yeah.

529
00:56:31,118 --> 00:56:34,278
We're heading down to Robinet.

530
00:56:34,438 --> 00:56:37,238
Say hello to Anders, ladies.

531
00:56:37,398 --> 00:56:40,918
Seriously, he's the best
connected guy in Oslo.

532
00:56:41,918 --> 00:56:43,478
Connected?

533
00:56:44,878 --> 00:56:47,518
- Why don't you tag along?
- Huh?

534
00:56:47,678 --> 00:56:49,878
- Come on.
- Maybe later.

535
00:56:50,038 --> 00:56:53,798
- Come on, join us.
- No, I'm waiting for Thomas.

536
00:56:55,238 --> 00:56:57,518
Okay, catch you later.

537
00:56:57,678 --> 00:57:00,718
- Him, or...?
- Two. The second season.

538
00:57:00,878 --> 00:57:05,358
Removing the main character
is radical. But it works.

539
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:08,038
Imagine doing that in a novel.

540
00:57:21,758 --> 00:57:24,718
- There you are.
- Hi.

541
00:57:24,878 --> 00:57:26,718
Have a seat.

542
00:57:27,718 --> 00:57:30,238
Calle's looking for you.

543
00:57:30,398 --> 00:57:32,598
Let him look.

544
00:57:39,518 --> 00:57:45,678
Are you okay? Is the
celebration taking its toll?

545
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:50,598
Calle told everyone it's my
birthday. It's actually tomorrow.

546
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:55,718
- I think he's trying to cheer me up.
- Birthdays are fun.

547
00:57:57,118 --> 00:58:01,478
It's a bit easier for you guys
to reach the thirties.

548
00:58:01,638 --> 00:58:06,798
Look at your pals. None of them
have girlfriends their own age.

549
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:11,438
My flat's full of girls I don't know.
20 years old with perky tits.

550
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:15,878
Your tits seem pretty perky to me.

551
00:58:18,678 --> 00:58:22,918
- It's been ages since you saw them.
- I'm an expert.

552
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:27,798
- There's no cause for alarm.
- Stop kidding.

553
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:30,478
I'm just trying to say...

554
00:58:30,638 --> 00:58:34,078
You remember Live?
She was here earlier.

555
00:58:34,238 --> 00:58:36,838
It's not important.

556
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:43,063
Anyway, she's of my age. One of
the few friends I still see.

557
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:46,838
Who haven't vanished into motherhood.

558
00:58:46,998 --> 00:58:50,118
She takes me aside, asks proudly -

559
00:58:50,278 --> 00:58:53,598
- for something
non-alcoholic to drink.

560
00:58:53,758 --> 00:58:58,718
- Everyone's having kids now.
- Well, fuck them. It's like...

561
00:58:59,758 --> 00:59:05,718
That's the great thing about you
and Calle. You don't compromise.

562
00:59:05,878 --> 00:59:10,438
- Would it be that odd if we had kids?
- No, but...

563
00:59:10,598 --> 00:59:13,598
We've been together for nine years.

564
00:59:14,598 --> 00:59:18,238
It's not like a kid
would change everything.

565
00:59:23,278 --> 00:59:28,358
- I'm sure you'll make great parents.
- You think so?

566
00:59:28,518 --> 00:59:31,918
But sometimes these
things take time, right?

567
00:59:32,078 --> 00:59:35,038
It's already taken years.

568
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:39,838
I think there's something
wrong with me. Some defect...

569
00:59:39,998 --> 00:59:42,678
I don't know what, it's just...

570
00:59:49,998 --> 00:59:53,358
Sorry. I'm a bit spaced out.

571
00:59:53,518 --> 00:59:56,318
I've had too much to drink.

572
00:59:58,078 --> 01:00:02,358
- Here I'm going on about my problems.
- No, no.

573
01:00:02,518 --> 01:00:04,558
It's all right.

574
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:10,398
I should go inside.
It's like my party.

575
01:00:11,198 --> 01:00:13,358
Hey...

576
01:00:13,518 --> 01:00:16,678
I haven't really had the chance.

577
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:18,798
Happy birthday.

578
01:00:37,238 --> 01:00:39,198
I'd better get inside.

579
01:00:44,438 --> 01:00:47,518
Hi, Iselin. It's me again.

580
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:49,638
I miss you.

581
01:00:50,998 --> 01:00:53,478
I have to get away from Oslo.

582
01:00:54,598 --> 01:00:57,198
I wish I could come and see you.

583
01:01:00,478 --> 01:01:04,398
I know I've said so before.
But I'm better now.

584
01:01:04,558 --> 01:01:06,678
You'll see.

585
01:01:08,038 --> 01:01:13,998
I've been thinking. I could study,
you could focus on your career.

586
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:20,718
The last time we met,
you said you still loved me.

587
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:24,638
I don't know if you meant it, but...

588
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:34,198
If you still feel...
If there's a shred left, then...

589
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:38,518
I don't know, I think we can...

590
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:25,198
But...

591
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:28,678
- Jeez, long time no see.
- Yeah, really.

592
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:32,598
- But... Aren't you clean now?
- Yeah.

593
01:03:32,758 --> 01:03:35,118
That's awesome.

594
01:03:39,718 --> 01:03:42,478
- You want a quarter?
- One gram.

595
01:03:43,678 --> 01:03:45,718
A full gram.

596
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:20,798
<i>- Is that Battlefield?
- Yeah, I just got it.</i>

597
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:25,838
Some bloke comes by, like,
"Can I get some extra for this?"

598
01:04:27,118 --> 01:04:31,558
It's ridiculous.
You end up with all this shit.

599
01:04:31,718 --> 01:04:35,398
It's fine when it's
stereo's and stuff.

600
01:04:35,558 --> 01:04:38,398
But you don't need fifteen pairs -

601
01:04:38,558 --> 01:04:43,158
- of shoes the wrong size.
That's just fucked up.

602
01:04:50,638 --> 01:04:52,118
800.

603
01:05:25,478 --> 01:05:28,918
- Hi!
- Hello! Damn good to see you!

604
01:05:29,078 --> 01:05:32,758
- I'm basically broke, but...
- What would you like?

605
01:05:32,918 --> 01:05:34,998
Gin & tonic.

606
01:05:36,038 --> 01:05:39,878
- What do you do?
- I'm a student.

607
01:05:40,038 --> 01:05:42,718
At the university?

608
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,718
Yeah, it's the university.

609
01:05:47,878 --> 01:05:52,518
- But it's the medical faculty.
- Oh dear.

610
01:05:52,678 --> 01:05:57,318
- Are you a doctor?
- I'm training to be a nutritionist.

611
01:05:57,478 --> 01:06:00,638
- What do you do?
- What do I do?

612
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:04,038
- You think that's interesting?
- Of course.

613
01:06:04,198 --> 01:06:09,918
- Well, I don't think it matters much.
- But what do you do?

614
01:06:11,998 --> 01:06:14,718
- You have to tell me.
- Why?

615
01:06:14,878 --> 01:06:18,718
I don't do anything. I'm...

616
01:06:18,878 --> 01:06:23,718
I'm just a loser.
Drinking to ease the pain.

617
01:06:23,878 --> 01:06:28,838
- You mean like every day?
- No, but it's true that I...

618
01:06:30,078 --> 01:06:35,158
I'm looking for sympathy.
I want someone to feel sorry for me.

619
01:06:35,318 --> 01:06:40,398
Feel sorry for you?
Do I fit the description?

620
01:06:40,558 --> 01:06:42,918
- I think you do.
- You do?

621
01:06:43,078 --> 01:06:47,478
- What did you say?
- I saw Rambo 3 the other day.

622
01:06:47,638 --> 01:06:50,878
And it's actually damn good.

623
01:06:51,038 --> 01:06:54,758
Is that the one
with Dolph Lundgren?

624
01:06:54,918 --> 01:06:57,238
Do you know him?

625
01:06:57,398 --> 01:07:00,838
He had this thing
with my girlfriend once.

626
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,398
- Bummer.
- Yeah.

627
01:07:03,558 --> 01:07:07,798
- They're waiting for us at the club.
- What's on? A rave?

628
01:07:16,838 --> 01:07:19,478
Hey? It's okay, really.

629
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:26,558
Hey? I'm telling you it's all right.
It's no big deal.

630
01:07:26,718 --> 01:07:30,678
- What do you mean?
- The thing with Iselin.

631
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:33,918
It was hell when it happened, but...

632
01:07:34,078 --> 01:07:36,318
When what happened?

633
01:07:36,478 --> 01:07:38,878
When you slept with her.

634
01:07:39,038 --> 01:07:44,958
So that's what I did? And you get
to go around forgiving people?

635
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:47,958
What's your problem?

636
01:07:49,038 --> 01:07:51,238
- Nothing.
- Just say it.

637
01:07:52,638 --> 01:07:57,678
- Are you seeing her these days?
- No, not at the moment.

638
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:00,678
Maybe there's a reason?

639
01:08:00,838 --> 01:08:06,158
You don't know shit about that.
You really have no idea.

640
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:08,158
I don't know you.

641
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:13,358
But I've seen the consequences
of how you treat people close to you.

642
01:08:13,518 --> 01:08:18,638
Jeez, whether I slept with her
or not, I mean, does it matter?

643
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:23,318
No. Right.

644
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:26,998
I know. I'm fucked.
Thanks for reminding me of that.

645
01:08:27,158 --> 01:08:33,078
I don't have to listen to this. I've
got friends far worse off than you.

646
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:36,078
But they don't act like assholes.

647
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,758
And this isn't about...
the fact that you're an addict.

648
01:12:34,358 --> 01:12:37,998
- But you won't...
- It's okay. Just...

649
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:43,278
No, no, you'll have
a thousand nights like this one.

650
01:12:43,438 --> 01:12:45,918
You won't remember this.

651
01:12:46,598 --> 01:12:50,278
- Everything will be forgotten.
- Everything?

652
01:12:50,438 --> 01:12:52,958
- Everything.
- Why's that?

653
01:12:55,118 --> 01:12:58,398
It's sort of a natural...

654
01:12:58,558 --> 01:13:00,718
A law of nature.

655
01:13:00,878 --> 01:13:03,678
- A rule?
- Yeah.

656
01:13:51,358 --> 01:13:56,158
- There's the echo spot.
- Yes, a classic Oslo site.

657
01:13:56,318 --> 01:13:59,638
We have to share with the newcomers.

658
01:14:01,278 --> 01:14:04,118
Just stand right here.

659
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:06,398
Now stomp real hard.

660
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:44,798
- What date is it today?
- It's... No, hold on.

661
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,438
It just became August 31st.

662
01:14:47,598 --> 01:14:52,238
- They'll drain the water tomorrow.
- Then we're in luck.

663
01:15:04,078 --> 01:15:07,118
Okay, are you ready?

664
01:15:12,838 --> 01:15:14,478
Some backflip!

665
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,118
- Is it cold?
- No, it's fine!

666
01:15:28,638 --> 01:15:30,918
I'm not going in without you.

667
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:39,598
I got water up my nose!

668
01:15:45,678 --> 01:15:47,558
Come on!

669
01:15:55,078 --> 01:15:56,958
Come.

670
01:18:18,598 --> 01:18:21,318
Hi Iselin. It's me again.

671
01:18:21,478 --> 01:18:26,838
It's late where you are. I thought
you might be out or something.

672
01:18:26,998 --> 01:18:31,118
It's nothing really,
I just wanted to...

673
01:18:31,278 --> 01:18:34,678
I didn't mean all the things
I said earlier.

674
01:18:34,838 --> 01:18:36,758
But by now you probably knew.

675
01:18:36,918 --> 01:18:42,878
I just wanted to talk to you
one last time, but... Well...

676
01:18:43,038 --> 01:18:46,358
I hope you're okay. I'm sorry.
