1
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:33,509
Get... get back in the truck!

2
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,783
Get back in the truck!

3
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,204
Hey, dispatch?

4
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,906
We have an emergency situation...

5
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,441
You hear that?

6
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:47,213
<i>Copy that. Stand by.</i>

7
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,217
Somebody got shot.

8
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,685
Officer Beck to headquarters. I...

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,454
Headquarters, shots fired, shots fired.

10
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,946
I need some units.
Shots fired, I need some units.

11
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:58,191
Shots fired.

12
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:02,061
<i>All units, all units
respond to Graham and Spring.</i>

13
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,164
Damn!

14
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:09,302
Back, back!

15
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,041
- Got him covered?
- I got him covered.

16
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,447
Move it, move back.

17
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,584
Stay back.

18
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,321
Get out of the way.

19
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,490
Move it.

20
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,391
Stay behind the line.

21
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:38,564
Stay behind the tape.

22
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,699
Back up.

23
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,101
Back up.

24
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,737
Hey, get back. I said back up.

25
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,172
Payback's a bitch.

26

27
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,916
<i>Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs.</i>

28
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:27,947
<i>Tying run on second base.</i>

29
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:29,682
<i>Yale's down 1-nothing.</i>

30
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,609
<i>Terry has a walk and a double,</i>

31
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,886
<i>but is now looking at an 0-2 count.</i>

32
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,913
<i>He steps to the plate.</i>

33
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:38,091
<i>Wow, what is Terry doing?</i>

34
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,026
<i>That is some serious trash-talking.</i>

35
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,362
<i>Crowd doesn't like it.
Not sure I do, either.</i>

36
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,429
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

37
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:47,694
<i>Folks, that is high, that is deep,
that is out of here!</i>

38
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,402
<i>Home run!</i>

39
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,873
- What do you see, Ruiz?
- An arrogant ass.

40
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,508
Is that accurate?

41
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,010
Not entirely, sir.

42
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,679
So why go Babe Ruth?

43
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,881
Well, because once
you tell someone how bad

44
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,584
you're about to screw them,
you have to come through.

45
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:09,604
There's been a police shooting
of an unarmed man today.

46
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,557
Gate Station, North Carolina.

47
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,360
Governor called me personally.

48
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,798
She wants the DOJ
to handle the investigation.

49
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,798
She doesn't want another Ferguson.

50
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,567
It's a black cop and a white kid.

51
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,645
Ruiz is going to run it,

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,693
but she wants a black prosecutor
out front; optics.

53
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,132
This climate, only a black man
can indict this black cop

54
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:34,009
without inciting tensions.
If he's guilty.

55
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,383
I've been through a stack of résumés,

56
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,851
and you guys all look the same.

57
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,920
First in your class at an Ivy.

58
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,889
Law review. All closers.

59
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:47,026
What I need is a cleaner.

60
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,695
I need that guy

61
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,231
who points to the fence
with two strikes on him.

62
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,733
He's barely a year out of law school.

63
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,835
That's just math, sir.

64
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,437
My recent work on
the Wynn case proved it.

65
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,238
I took over arguments
and got three indictments.

66
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:02,341
The team got three indictments.

67
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,377
Yes, the team.

68
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,478
What about those optics?

69
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,946
All I care about is the truth.

70
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,315
And my truth has no color.

71
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,817
That's a lovely naiveté.

72
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,717
Thank you.

73
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,819
That wasn't praise.

74
00:04:17,306 --> 00:04:20,406
Our own Attorney General
said that the biggest challenge

75
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:23,680
for all of us in this office
is not only to represent

76
00:04:23,705 --> 00:04:26,866
and enforce the law,
but to use it to make real

77
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,500
the promise of America,
the promise of fairness

78
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,305
and equality.

79
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:34,440
Is she naive, sir?

80
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,179
Because if so, I'm happy
to wear that badge with her.

81
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,692
Uh-oh, what you got?

82
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,194
Eh, eh, eh. Seven, eight...

83
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,063
bam!

84
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,066
Oh, lucky!

85
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,534
Hey, what's that on your face?

86
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,337
What's that on your face?

87
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,381
Listen, Boogs,

88
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,983
Mommy has to go out of town for work.

89
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,484
For how long this time?

90
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,954
I don't know, but, uh,
we're going to Face Chat

91
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,489
every morning and every night, okay?

92
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:27,193
Even though that face will
probably break my computer.

93
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,729
Well, I get my looks from you.

94
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,531
- Oh!
- Hey, Kai.

95
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,921
- It's time for bed.
- What?

96
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:35,514
No.

97
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,504
Hey, Paula, we're good.
We're just gonna play one more game.

98
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,623
Her bedtime is 8:30.

99
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:44,310
We can make an exception tonight.

100
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,473
Look, you're not the one
who has to drag her

101
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,848
out of bed in the morning
and get her to school on time.

102
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:50,049
I'm not even sleepy, yet.

103
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,451
Kai, start your night routine, now!

104
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:58,758
It's okay, Boogs... Mommy loves you.

105
00:05:58,792 --> 00:05:59,892
Mmm, I love you, I love you.

106
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,663
Good night.

107
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,537
Raise your voice
in front of my kid again

108
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,369
and I'll give you
a hysterectomy with my fist.

109
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:16,309
Hey, hey, hey, what's happening?

110
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,278
Get off me!

111
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,480
What the hell, Ashe?

112
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,283
She's a child, Javi,
trying to play house.

113
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,153
Kai has a mother... remind her of that.

114
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,321
By throwing a vase at her head?

115
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,655
I threw it by her head.

116
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,661
- You need to see somebody.
- I am.

117
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,330
- I'm serious.
- I will.

118
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,998
I can't have this craziness.

119
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,499
You used to like crazy.

120
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,835
Yeah, but then we had a kid.

121
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:47,373
So you go get yourself wifey material.

122
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,840
With the apron and dinner waiting
for you when you get home.

123
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:53,256
We both know you're bored as hell.

124
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,451
Does she know what you're really like?

125
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,584
How you like it?

126
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,923
Does she know when you're with
her, I'm inside your head?

127
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,064
I got to go check on my daughter.

128
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,406
Tell her... tell her
I'm gonna call her tomorrow.

129
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,709
<i>Second in touchdowns.</i>

130
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,147
<i>Mace, what-what's up with that?</i>

131
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:33,052
<i>Are you starting to get
a little tired inside the 20?</i>

132
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,991
- So you're their boy.
- Excuse me?

133
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,395
I'm Ashe Akino... your investigator.

134
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,163
Preston Terry, your boss.

135
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,698
Interim, right?

136
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,668
Ruiz is just tying up some
loose ends on another case?

137
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,003
Yeah, he'll be done in about a week.

138
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,739
I know Ruiz, but what's your steelo?

139
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,340
How aggressive I go is up to you.

140
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:57,810
Do your job the right way...
by the book.

141
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,013
Job the right way... you got it.

142
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,670
Boss.

143
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,919
<i>Welcome to North Carolina.</i>

144
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,021
<i>For those of you boarding
flights to Chicago...</i>

145
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,461
Preston Terry?

146
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,962
- Yes?
- Hi.

147
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,664
I'm Sarah Ellis,
aide to Governor Eamons.

148
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,304
Welcome to North Carolina.

149
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:21,890
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

150
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,636
- Ashe Akino.
- My investigator.

151
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,539
Well, I'm sure you're eager
to hit the ground running.

152
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,007
The governor's just hoping
to have a quick word with you.

153
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,498
Of course.

154
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,278
<i>I wish you were here</i>

155
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:34,613
under better circumstances,
but I do hope

156
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,450
you'll get a feel for
our Southern hospitality.

157
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,129
Born and raised in Virginia, ma'am.

158
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:40,853
A Southern gentleman.

159
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,489
Though you all call yourselves
Mid-Atlantic state now.

160
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,124
No, that's just the Northern Virginians.

161
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,360
Well, I want you to know I am

162
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,363
fully behind this investigation,
and I have assurances

163
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,345
from the department you'll
have their full cooperation.

164
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,566
Well, we appreciate that, ma'am.

165
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:55,541
I'm not a fan of surprises,

166
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:57,746
so I'd appreciate
being kept up to speed.

167
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,639
That said, she's a busy woman,
so just reach out to me.

168
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,107
I'll be at your hotel

169
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,742
for the next few days to make
sure you guys get a good start.

170
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,344
I want to make sure
to stay in front of this.

171
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,081
We don't need any crazy rednecks
looting the local Cracker Barrel.

172
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,416
Yes, ma'am.

173
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,775
Move it.

174
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,155
I said be quiet.

175
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,228
Can I help you?

176
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,564
Preston Terry, attorney
with DOJ Civil Rights.

177
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,399
I should have known from the suit.

178
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,935
We're strictly buy one,
get two free down here.

179
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,238
- This is Ashe Akino, my investigator.
- Hi.

180
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,740
How long you been on the job?

181
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,843
Two years patrol, got tapped by DEA,

182
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,345
worked Colombia and Mexico
for six years.

183
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,481
And you gave all that up
for the cushy life?

184
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,083
I like being my own boss.

185
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,818
So where y'all want to start?
Whatever you need.

186
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,453
A conversation with Deputy Beck,

187
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,088
and then the crime scene.

188
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,524
Not a crime scene until
the crime has been determined.

189
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,361
- Absolutely right.
- Right.

190
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,697
Beck's in Interview Two.

191
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,403
All right, guys, roll call.

192
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,943
I'm not talking without my union rep.

193
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:42,730
Look, I've read your report.

194
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:44,877
I just want to hear it from you.

195
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,313
It's just a conversation.

196
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,950
I've been where you're at.

197
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:04,330
My second day on the streets,
I'm out with my T.O.

198
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,031
White dude.

199
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,900
Routine traffic stop.

200
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,970
Only the kid in the passenger
seat takes off running.

201
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,506
So I give chase.

202
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,843
Catch him pretty quick,
but he starts fighting me.

203
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,578
My T.O. just stands there watching,

204
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,915
wants to see if a girl
can handle herself.

205
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:26,585
I get the upper hand,
when suddenly the kid

206
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,321
is reaching for something behind him.

207
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,856
My T.O. is frozen.

208
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,992
He yells, "Gun!"

209
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,662
I draw and I shoot
this kid in the chest.

210
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,699
Only there's no gun, just a cell phone.

211
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,269
18 years old.

212
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,871
But I told the truth.

213
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,907
At least I have that.

214
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,508
And you were cleared?

215
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:54,095
Ruled justifiable.
I reasonably feared for my life.

216
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,054
It was a clean shoot.

217
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,111
Tell me about it.

218
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,551
I'm on patrol.

219
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,529
White guy in a nice vehicle.

220
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:12,273
White guy in that neighborhood

221
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,867
usually means drugs, so I hit my lights,

222
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,802
pull him over.

223
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,339
I approach the vehicle,
ask him a few questions, but...

224
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,975
the guy was belligerent.

225
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,810
Refuses to answer anything.

226
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,146
So I ask him to step out of the vehicle.

227
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,382
He refuses.

228
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:34,420
So I put my hand on my weapon
and I ask him again.

229
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:38,824
He finally complies,
but as he steps out,

230
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,595
he reaches for my gun,
actually gets a hand on it.

231
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:48,331
In that moment, it was either him or me.

232
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,003
And I shot him.

233
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,847
Four times.

234
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:56,742
Yes, he continued to struggle.

235
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,411
Was there anything substantiating
your initial suspicions?

236
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:02,314
Lieutenant Breeland found
marijuana, two 20s,

237
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,849
in his search of the vehicle.

238
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,051
And was this search done
before or after the shooting?

239
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,087
After.

240
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,127
Now, you said white guy in
that neighborhood means drugs.

241
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,196
- Yes, sir.
- Was there a legitimate cause

242
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,665
for the initial stop, or was
it all just based on profiling?

243
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,072
I'm gonna wait for my union rep now.

244
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,148
He's ready to give me his life
story, and you shut him down.

245
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,016
I don't do anything without a reason.

246
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,585
Really?

247
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,187
'Cause it felt like a rookie mistake.

248
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,489
From now on,

249
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,706
I'll handle the interviews.

250
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,894
Look, I understand you
like being your own boss,

251
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,330
but that's not the case here.

252
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,807
Like you said, you follow my lead.

253
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:59,071
Wow, only took you two hours
to start swinging your junk.

254
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,939
Most guys at least wait a day.

255
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,609
I don't believe in wasting time.

256
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,377
Neither do I.

257
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,279
You're a smart brother...
you've seen my file.

258
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,481
So ask yourself, if I tell

259
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,279
Ruiz you don't know
what the hell you're doing,

260
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:13,865
who goes, who stays?

261
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,294
No surveillance cameras,

262
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:03,029
but someone saw something.

263
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:04,764
What's good, sis?

264
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,099
I'm Ashe,

265
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,201
from the Department of Justice.

266
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:09,436
We're here investigating a shooting.

267
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,870
- You see anything?
- Nope.

268
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:12,872
- Know anybody who did?
- Yeah.

269
00:15:12,907 --> 00:15:14,073
The cop that shot him.

270
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:16,443
- You looking for video?
- You got any?

271
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:19,379
Yeah, I got the new <i>Star Wars...</i>
not even out yet.

272
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:23,283
Look, we're not police...
we're investigating police.

273
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:24,751
You smell like police.

274
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,085
That your squad?

275
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,720
That against the law?

276
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:29,389
That's my big brother.

277
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:30,590
Whatever, man.

278
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:33,126
I'm serious... real talk, man, look.

279
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:37,630
Mace a beast!

280
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:38,998
- He's your fam for real?
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:40,934
How come you're not in the league?

282
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:42,669
Decided to change the world instead.

283
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:44,971
Damn, you messed up.

284
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,774
So what's this dude Beck like?

285
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,175
He's all right.

286
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,611
Not like the boys who roll through
here cracking heads for nothing.

287
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:52,768
He's a sellout.

288
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:55,114
You don't think the neighborhood
could use black cops?

289
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:56,449
Yeah, but he ain't hood no more.

290
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:58,084
So y'all ain't seen nothing, or...

291
00:15:58,118 --> 00:15:59,919
hear nothing?

292
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,923
No one's got answers for you,

293
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:03,456
'cause you keep asking
the wrong question.

294
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:05,258
So what's the right question?

295
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:10,330
Aw, man.

296
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,566
Look, talk to us... we can protect you.

297
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:22,108
They trying to intimidate them or us?

298
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:28,748
The police have been here two times now,

299
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:31,117
asking these same questions.

300
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:33,553
Meanwhile, this man is still
walking around free.

301
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:35,622
I understand how you feel.

302
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,056
No, you don't.

303
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:38,825
My son is dead.

304
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,582
People seem put off by my anger.

305
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,300
They're expecting something else.

306
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:49,606
Do you know why your son
was in that neighborhood?

307
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:51,304
Driving in that neighborhood
is not a crime.

308
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:52,305
What about drugs?

309
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,407
My son didn't do drugs.

310
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:56,676
Did they tell you they found
marijuana in his car?

311
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,778
I don't care.

312
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:00,246
The officer said he went for his gun.

313
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:01,681
Jesse would never do that!

314
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:02,549
How do you know?

315
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,417
Because I know my son.

316
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:06,953
Y'all can try to paint him
as a criminal all you want,

317
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:08,888
but that is not who he was.

318
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:11,090
He was a great kid.

319
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:16,129
And he would hate this shirt.

320
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:19,632
But the funeral home said
he had to be in a suit,

321
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:23,536
and all he has are T-shirts
with comics on them.

322
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:27,407
So I spent the entire morning
shopping for this dress shirt

323
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:30,410
I know he'd never wear.

324
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:34,240
We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

325
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,436
I didn't lose him.

326
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:40,887
He was murdered.

327
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,822
<i>I'm a good cop.</i>

328
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:47,126
Yes, but perception is reality.

329
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:49,907
You got to change perception.

330
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:55,204
Come to my church.
Make a statement in God's house.

331
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:56,302
I'll stand with you.

332
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:57,403
I'm not making any statements.

333
00:17:57,438 --> 00:17:58,905
- Josh, maybe it would be...
- No.

334
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:01,007
Brother, the media's a powerful thing.

335
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,509
They can make the guilty
innocent, innocent guilty.

336
00:18:03,544 --> 00:18:05,411
And an unknown pastor a star.

337
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,551
All right, then.

338
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:16,422
Thank you for your hospitality.

339
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:25,732
<i>A tragedy has come</i>

340
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:28,468
to Gate Station, the town I grew up in.

341
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:30,903
A young college student

342
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:32,872
has been killed.

343
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:35,041
And when there are questions,
I want answers.

344
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:38,611
I have personally reached out
to the Department of Justice

345
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:40,246
and asked for an outside prosecutor

346
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,981
to ensure an impartial investigation

347
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:43,082
into this matter.

348
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:45,084
And Sheriff Platt agrees.

349
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,553
He, too, wants to make sure
that trust remains

350
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,956
between law enforcement
and the community.

351
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,357
What trust?

352
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,661
Yes, ma'am.

353
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:56,095
I would like to introduce Preston Terry,

354
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,397
who will answer any questions.

355
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:59,899
- Mr. Terry, thank you.
- Thank you, Governor.

356
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:03,102
Is there any video of the shooting,
or any witnesses?

357
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:06,706
Uh, no video has surfaced as of yet,
and no witnesses have come forward.

358
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,940
But it's still early
in the investigation.

359
00:19:07,975 --> 00:19:10,777
Can you confirm that the name
of the officer is Joshua Beck?

360
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:12,345
We're not releasing
his name at this time.

361
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:13,513
But he is black?

362
00:19:13,547 --> 00:19:16,419
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- We've all seen the cell phone footage.

363
00:19:16,444 --> 00:19:18,251
The officer is black,
the victim is white.

364
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:21,020
What I don't understand
is why you're here.

365
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:22,955
All the murdering of unarmed black men

366
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,358
by police across this country, and this

367
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:27,694
is the one that the government
is investigating?

368
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:29,562
Oh, so only black lives matter?

369
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:31,397
I'm sorry, when is the last time
you were pulled over

370
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:33,433
by the police and didn't know if you
were going to make it out alive?

371
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,584
Listen, as a prosecutor,

372
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,123
it is my job to ignore
all personal biases

373
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:39,706
and to focus on the truth.

374
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:42,075
And I must admit, that can be hard.

375
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:43,891
That can be tough.

376
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:47,641
See, when I watch recent video of...
of Laquan McDonald,

377
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:50,650
of Tamir Rice, of Walter Scott,
shot in the back,

378
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:53,408
murdered while running away
from a child support payment,

379
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:54,744
I am sickened.

380
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:57,090
Sickened by the utter lack of humanity

381
00:19:57,124 --> 00:19:59,492
displayed by those officers and angered

382
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:01,594
at the arrogance of their lies.

383
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:03,229
See, now, they knew that
there would be an assumption

384
00:20:03,263 --> 00:20:06,799
of innocence not because of
blue, but because of white.

385
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:09,602
And now an anomaly has occurred.

386
00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:12,772
A black police officer has shot
and killed an unarmed white man,

387
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:14,807
and they have sent in the cavalry.

388
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:16,275
Now, is the cavalry here

389
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,177
to bring justice to the unarmed
white man,

390
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:20,179
or to exonerate an innocent
black police officer?

391
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:21,814
I won't know until I've garnered all

392
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:25,118
<i>...the facts of the case.
But I am here because every citizen</i>

393
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:27,954
<i>deserves a system
that is fair and transparent.</i>

394
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:30,323
<i>I am here because
we are creating a generation</i>

395
00:20:30,357 --> 00:20:32,158
<i>of Americans who are becoming quickly</i>

396
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:35,532
<i>disillusioned with the postracial
America we like to tout.</i>

397
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:37,705
<i>In fact, I'm not even a day
into this case, and already</i>

398
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,365
<i>we see it's about race.</i>

399
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,601
But I am not disillusioned.

400
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,936
I am working this case as a prosecutor

401
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:45,204
trying to determine

402
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:47,540
what happened that day between two men.

403
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:49,575
And I believe that my success

404
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,611
will serve as an example
to us all of why we have

405
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:55,314
got to start putting
each other's humanity first.

406
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:57,617
None of us will like the America
we end up with

407
00:20:57,651 --> 00:21:00,019
if we don't start working
very hard at this.

408
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:02,889
And that work begins today.

409
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:04,090
Thank you.

410
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:06,259
Thank you very much.

411
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:08,761
Governor!

412
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:10,763
You just made the rest of my day hell.

413
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:11,931
How's that?

414
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,466
She worked all morning on that speech,

415
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,435
and now no one will remember
a single word of it.

416
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,471
You owe me for that.

417
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,243
Pastor Janae James.

418
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:26,312
Those were some powerful words.

419
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:28,447
I really hope you're here
to listen, too.

420
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:29,916
Absolutely.

421
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,318
That's a whole lot harder to do.

422
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:34,020
Why do I feel a sermon coming on?

423
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,891
I'll save that for Sunday.

424
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:40,893
Chosen House, 10:00 a.m.

425
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,793
<i>Today, during a speech on the steps
of Gate Station City Hall...</i>

426
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:56,954
I'll have what he's having.

427
00:21:57,044 --> 00:21:58,504
It's just orange juice.

428
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,447
So y-you just assume I'm a drinker?

429
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:03,216
Educated guess.

430
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,750
I'm sort of offended.

431
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:08,071
You can throw some vodka in there.

432
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:12,625
Your speech surprised me today.

433
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,827
You don't know me well
enough to be surprised.

434
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:18,431
You're right... you and I,
we need to find our rhythm.

435
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:20,266
Right now we're just butting heads.

436
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,068
Yeah, well, you're the one banging.

437
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:24,003
You judge too quickly.

438
00:22:24,037 --> 00:22:25,504
I was police... it's what we do.

439
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:27,340
You judged me too quickly.

440
00:22:27,374 --> 00:22:28,975
I'm not a sellout.

441
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:30,309
Did I call you one?

442
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:31,777
You called me "their boy."

443
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:35,081
Fine, fine, I apologize.

444
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:37,183
I also thought you were gay.

445
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:39,252
Sorry for that, too, I guess.

446
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:40,753
Now, why would you think that?

447
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:43,041
Because I got nothing
from you when we first met.

448
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:44,857
Yeah, well, maybe you're not my type.

449
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:46,423
I'm every guy's type.

450
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:51,597
Now, anyway, I don't piss where I eat.

451
00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:53,699
Hmm.

452
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:55,101
So what's your type?

453
00:22:55,135 --> 00:22:56,936
I guess I'm waiting on my Michelle.

454
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,970
- Obama?
- Mm-hmm.

455
00:22:58,005 --> 00:23:00,006
She's dope... why her?

456
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,407
She's the kind of woman

457
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:04,777
that makes you seem like a better man.

458
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,979
Couldn't handle me anyway.

459
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:12,312
That story you told Beck, was that true?

460
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,287
Yep.

461
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:17,823
How does anyone get over that?

462
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:22,495
I know it's gonna
come back on me one day.

463
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:25,798
I just, um, don't want it
coming back on my daughter.

464
00:23:25,832 --> 00:23:27,934
- How old is she?
- Six.

465
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:33,406
Look, I'll take care of this.

466
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,674
You grab coffee tomorrow.

467
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:35,775
You got it.

468
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,010
Boss.

469
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:41,047
You believe half of what
you said in that speech?

470
00:23:42,816 --> 00:23:44,483
Half.

471
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:03,936
Hey.

472
00:24:03,971 --> 00:24:04,804
You lost?

473
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:07,473
I'm looking for you.

474
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:09,809
I don't talk to Five-O.

475
00:24:09,843 --> 00:24:11,310
I already told you, I'm not a cop.

476
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:14,046
Look, bro, I've got nothing to say.

477
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:16,382
I'm going to see
my brother this weekend.

478
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,717
You want a signed football?

479
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,052
For real?

480
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:21,487
You straight bribing me, man.

481
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:23,255
You said I wasn't
asking the right question.

482
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,724
So what do I got to ask?

483
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:28,127
You need to go ask Miss Campbell.

484
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,595
Who's Miss Campbell?

485
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:31,597
This lady in The Houses.

486
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:33,199
What are The Houses?

487
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:54,987
308.

488
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:27,978
Morning.

489
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:29,392
Morning.

490
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:31,931
- Thanks.
- What the hell?

491
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:33,419
What happened?

492
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:35,592
Last night, part of town
called The Houses.

493
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:36,848
I was following a lead.

494
00:25:36,873 --> 00:25:38,592
Do you think I'm incapable
of doing my job?

495
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:39,567
No.

496
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,727
Then stop trying to do it for me.

497
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:44,907
I can't keep chalking this
up to you being brand-new.

498
00:25:44,985 --> 00:25:46,632
Look, I felt like I made a connection

499
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:48,457
with that kid in the jersey.

500
00:25:48,492 --> 00:25:50,266
Okay, I thought maybe
if we spoke one on one

501
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,559
I could get some more info.

502
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:54,967
But you're right... I should have
spoken to you first.

503
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:56,259
Yeah, you should have.

504
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:58,100
You should see a doctor.

505
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:01,620
Pride hurts more than
my body, but thank you.

506
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:03,681
So what'd he tell you?

507
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:06,103
He told me to speak
to a woman in The Houses

508
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:08,186
named Miss Campbell in 308.

509
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,437
Which somebody didn't want you to do.

510
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:12,530
That is the conclusion I'm drawing, yes.

511
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:14,400
So let me go find out what she knows.

512
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:15,693
You can't go by yourself.

513
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:17,395
I got a gun.

514
00:26:42,988 --> 00:26:44,255
How y'all doing?

515
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,542
Who is it?

516
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,296
We're from the Department of Justice.

517
00:26:52,331 --> 00:26:53,831
We're here to see Miss Campbell.

518
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,698
Department of Justice...

519
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:57,001
that's with the government, right?

520
00:26:57,035 --> 00:27:00,204
Yes, ma'am, we're here
investigating a shooting.

521
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:15,453
- You're the one was on TV.
- Yes, ma'am.

522
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:17,455
Sounded almost like a preacher.

523
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:18,809
What do you know

524
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:21,469
about the young white kid who
was just killed by the cop?

525
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:23,794
The white kid... why would I know
anything about that?

526
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:25,630
We were told to ask you the question.

527
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:28,355
By who? I don't know why they said that.

528
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,867
Do you know Officer Beck?

529
00:27:29,901 --> 00:27:33,201
I mean, I seened him around,
but I don't know him.

530
00:27:33,404 --> 00:27:35,306
What about the young man
who was killed, Jesse Carr?

531
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,508
I'm sorry, I don't know anything.

532
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:50,921
When did you lose your son?

533
00:27:57,296 --> 00:27:59,297
Thought that's why you was here.

534
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:00,598
Should've known better.

535
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:01,565
What do you mean?

536
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,268
I can't talk about it.

537
00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:05,736
Who told you that, your lawyer?

538
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,006
The police?

539
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,175
Look, we're not police.

540
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:12,910
Whatever you say stays right here.

541
00:28:12,944 --> 00:28:15,212
Your son's death was never investigated?

542
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:18,916
Meanwhile this white boy all over my TV.

543
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,985
What did the police tell you?

544
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:26,857
They knock on my door,
say they found Joey dead.

545
00:28:26,892 --> 00:28:30,027
No "Sorry for your loss, ma'am."

546
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:32,697
No "You okay, ma'am?"

547
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:34,932
They just come in
and go through his things,

548
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:36,967
and found a bag of weed.

549
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:40,738
Then another cop come in, say I
could go to jail for that, too.

550
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:43,808
Say I need to stay quiet while
they do their investigation,

551
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:45,743
otherwise it'd be obstruction,
and the judge

552
00:28:45,777 --> 00:28:47,478
could take away my kid.

553
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:49,747
Have you heard any more about it?

554
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,249
Nothing from police.

555
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,186
But people round here are saying
they had something to do with it.

556
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:58,155
There were witnesses?

557
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:01,359
Just not the right kind.

558
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:04,428
Guess we figured out the right question.

559
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:06,263
Nothing she says has anything
to do with our case.

560
00:29:06,298 --> 00:29:07,598
It has everything to do with it.

561
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:09,700
The department is obviously corrupt.

562
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,369
Just because someone told her the police

563
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:13,070
were involved doesn't make it fact.

564
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:17,341
But a cop telling her to keep her
mouth shut, or they'll take her kid?

565
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:18,609
We have to dig.

566
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:20,077
Look, I understand your instinct,

567
00:29:20,112 --> 00:29:21,679
but that's not why we're here.

568
00:29:21,713 --> 00:29:23,381
I don't think you do.

569
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:24,415
What?

570
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:25,716
Share my instincts.

571
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:27,218
'Cause I'm real uncomfortable right now.

572
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:29,365
Look, Beck is the only
brother in the department

573
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,189
in a city that's 65% black.
I'm uncomfortable.

574
00:29:32,224 --> 00:29:33,958
But we have to work the case
we've been assigned.

575
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:36,594
We do a great job, then we have
the leverage to open it up.

576
00:29:36,628 --> 00:29:38,195
You can do that?

577
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,797
Just forget what you just heard?

578
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:42,633
I'm not asking you to forget...
I'm asking you to be patient.

579
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:43,934
Can you do that?

580
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:46,404
Sure.

581
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:53,644
Jumps off the balcony.

582
00:29:53,678 --> 00:29:56,080
I swear to God this guy
starts pissing himself.

583
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:00,584
Y'all headed to choir practice?

584
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:03,988
What do you know about choir practice?

585
00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:05,890
I know I'm buying.

586
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:07,425
Another one?

587
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:10,761
Where are all the females?

588
00:30:10,796 --> 00:30:12,163
Are you looking for one?

589
00:30:12,197 --> 00:30:13,297
Come on, now.

590
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:15,299
Cheers.

591
00:30:17,135 --> 00:30:19,103
Ooh.

592
00:30:19,137 --> 00:30:21,572
What the hell was that?

593
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:22,973
Prairie Fire.

594
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:24,408
It's Wild Turkey and Tabasco.

595
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:26,911
I think I just grew a testicle.

596
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:29,480
- Y'all get home safe, now.
- Breeland, right?

597
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:31,682
Lieutenant Breeland.

598
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:33,751
We were supposed to have a conversation.

599
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:35,186
Yeah, I don't go in the box.

600
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,954
Wasn't trying to put you there.

601
00:30:36,988 --> 00:30:39,688
You were first on the scene...
just looking for a quick statement.

602
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:49,807
The training officer who
yelled "gun" at your shooting,

603
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:51,202
was he ever prosecuted?

604
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,094
News travels fast around here.

605
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,580
Ah, we're like family.

606
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:56,683
No, he wasn't, either.

607
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:58,648
I'm not trying to bulldog you here.

608
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:02,213
I'm just trying to get my head
around why a former cop

609
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:04,982
who killed an unarmed teenager
and didn't get prosecuted is now

610
00:31:05,016 --> 00:31:07,785
- working cops.
- I'm not IA.

611
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:09,453
I just go after bad guys.

612
00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:10,955
Well, Beck's a good guy.

613
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:14,825
To good cops.

614
00:31:19,264 --> 00:31:21,165
So what's the deal with The Houses?

615
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,132
What about them?

616
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:23,300
I keep hearing

617
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:25,736
it's like the Wild West down there.

618
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,305
Personally, I never ran any tours there.

619
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,140
- Tours?
- It's nothing, it's stupid.

620
00:31:30,175 --> 00:31:33,277
It's like a tour of duty... it's rough.

621
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,745
Ashe Akino?

622
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:36,514
Yes?

623
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:37,848
You've been served.

624
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:51,462
I don't understand.

625
00:31:51,837 --> 00:31:53,464
I don't understand.

626
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,218
<i>I keep making excuses for you, Ashe.</i>

627
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:57,664
<i>But I can't anymore.</i>

628
00:31:57,689 --> 00:32:02,206
<i>I don't think that you're okay.
I don't, I don't trust you.</i>

629
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,941
I would never hurt Kai.

630
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,544
I would never hurt her.

631
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,097
<i>Look...</i>

632
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:11,730
Okay, I-I'll get help,
I'll get help, I promise.

633
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,478
<i>You've been saying that for a year.</i>

634
00:32:13,503 --> 00:32:14,674
- Javier...
- <i>We can't talk.</i>

635
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,246
<i>We can't, we can't talk
about this anymore.</i>

636
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,721
<i>You've got to talk to my lawyer.</i>

637
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:24,295
Javier, she's the only thing
that makes sense.

638
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:25,296
Please.

639
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:27,598
<i>Yeah.</i>

640
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:29,231
She's the only thing that makes sense.

641
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:30,901
<i>She matters to me, too.</i>

642
00:32:44,645 --> 00:32:46,276
I'll bring you on the field,
bring you backstage,

643
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:47,968
- the locker room, meet everybody.
- Oh, really?

644
00:32:48,002 --> 00:32:49,510
Yeah, no problem.

645
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:52,873
So who tuned you up, baby bro?

646
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:54,174
It's nothing, it's a little scrap.

647
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:56,009
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

648
00:32:56,044 --> 00:32:57,703
Because you know I got people, right?

649
00:32:57,746 --> 00:33:00,080
You talking retaliation
in front of law enforcement?

650
00:33:00,115 --> 00:33:01,682
Girl, please, you too pretty
to be a cop.

651
00:33:01,716 --> 00:33:03,015
You too pretty to play ball.

652
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:07,521
So, what, you dig cuffing brothers?

653
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:10,670
I dig cuffing bad guys...
they come in all shades.

654
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:11,929
Why?

655
00:33:11,966 --> 00:33:14,395
- Because I'm good at it.
- What makes you so good?

656
00:33:15,013 --> 00:33:17,798
I understand how easy it can happen,

657
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:20,535
going down that other path.

658
00:33:21,403 --> 00:33:23,037
And I respect it.

659
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:27,816
But I'm sure you prep school Negroes
have a different mindset.

660
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:30,132
No, no, no, no.
Pres, he went to prep schools...

661
00:33:30,228 --> 00:33:32,513
- I'm a hood cat.
- You wear that like it's a badge.

662
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:33,888
Hell yeah, fought for everything I got,

663
00:33:33,915 --> 00:33:35,582
ain't nothing was handed to me.

664
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:37,985
- Trust me, you had it easier.
- Please.

665
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,130
Do you know where this boy spent
his summers in high school?

666
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:41,288
The Alps.

667
00:33:41,322 --> 00:33:43,073
His best friend's pop was a billionaire.

668
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:45,777
But it's all good, because our parents
are living in a house...

669
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:47,723
that I paid for.

670
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:50,998
What's your shelf life, Mace?

671
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:52,928
Five years?

672
00:33:52,953 --> 00:33:55,202
Look, I'll be running Justice by
then, and just getting started.

673
00:33:55,236 --> 00:33:56,703
Yeah, I saw you on TV.

674
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:58,539
How is it you always end up
playing for the wrong team?

675
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,440
It's funny how black folks
on the sidelines are always

676
00:34:00,475 --> 00:34:01,722
the ones questioning loyalty.

677
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:03,034
I never played on no sidelines.

678
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,111
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

679
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:05,813
So, what, you think tweeting
"Black lives matter"

680
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:08,248
to your million followers
makes you Jackie Robinson?

681
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:11,418
1.4... and at least folks know
what side I'm on.

682
00:34:11,452 --> 00:34:13,787
Damn, I thought...

683
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:16,490
I thought I missed out, being
an only child, but I guess not.

684
00:34:16,524 --> 00:34:18,192
Nah, we go.

685
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:22,229
But it's all love.

686
00:34:22,263 --> 00:34:23,564
Right, baby bro?

687
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:24,798
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

688
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,799
All love.

689
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,301
Look.

690
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:28,936
Appreciate the meal.

691
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:31,839
We've got work to do.

692
00:34:32,566 --> 00:34:35,558
I'm not walking away
from this $50 steak.

693
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,206
It's all good... I'll take her home.

694
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,730
See you tomorrow.

695
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,935
I was surprised to get your text.

696
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,770
You said I owe you.

697
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:06,139
Actually, um, I owe you.

698
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:07,574
How's that?

699
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:11,378
Your speech was the lead story
on every statewide affiliate,

700
00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:14,473
and on the front page
of every local newspaper.

701
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:18,332
And the governor is standing
right there next to you.

702
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,009
Come on.

703
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,736
<i>You're making me blush.</i>

704
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,272
Really, under all that chocolate?

705
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:44,177
You know he thinks we're
hitting it right now, right?

706
00:35:44,212 --> 00:35:45,479
So why aren't we?

707
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:49,206
Because if we do, I won't respect you.

708
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:52,019
And I think I like you.

709
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:54,421
Maybe I don't want
to be liked right now.

710
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,859
Wow.

711
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:00,694
Girl, you sexy as hell.

712
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:02,562
But you've got some of the saddest eyes

713
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,932
I've ever seen.

714
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:09,096
I don't know, maybe
that's why I'm digging you.

715
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:12,105
I appreciate the sentiment,

716
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,243
but, um, you sound like
a real bitch right now.

717
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:22,301
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

718
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:52,661
No, Shirlane, this is
not how things work.

719
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:54,815
I don't give a damn about a heads up.

720
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,216
That's too late.

721
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:58,251
You're going to get me fired.

722
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:00,687
When's it running?

723
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:04,364
- What's going on?
- A video just hit.

724
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,895
Of what?

725
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,897
<i>But what is quite clear
are the racist remarks.</i>

726
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:11,031
<i>Officials say those remarks
are from Joshua Beck,</i>

727
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:13,467
<i>an African-American deputy.</i>

728
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,035
<i>All right, fam.</i>

729
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:16,970
<i>Just graduated from the Academy.</i>

730
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:19,439
<i>Grown-ass man now. Any last words?</i>

731
00:37:19,474 --> 00:37:21,475
Uh, yeah.

732
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:24,825
Um... finally got my license
to shoot these crackers.

733
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,047
That's right, Josh.

734
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:28,897
That's right, my boy's bulletproof.

735
00:37:28,922 --> 00:37:30,817
<i>Now, we've heard no comment
from Deputy Beck</i>

736
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,311
<i>or the Gate Station Sheriff's Office</i>

737
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:34,085
<i>regarding this inflammatory video.</i>

738
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,977
Hello?

739
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,508
<i>- Sources within the department say...
- Mm-hmm, yeah.</i>

740
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:49,423
I was drunk, sir.

741
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:52,271
Just, uh, popping off at the mouth.

742
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:53,670
You know that's not how I really feel.

743
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:56,006
Hell, I've said things
sober that'd get me fired.

744
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:58,179
No one here's taking offense.

745
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,688
Thank you, Kerry.

746
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:04,641
What about the guys?

747
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:08,008
Well, there's a box of saltines
on your desk with a bow on it.

748
00:38:11,443 --> 00:38:14,190
Unfortunately, the media's
not so forgiving.

749
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:15,618
I can handle that.

750
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:16,760
I know you can.

751
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:19,520
But I think it's best we
keep you on administrative duty

752
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:21,766
until these DOJ people
finish their investigation.

753
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,049
- What?
- Daddy!

754
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:24,825
Okay, little man.

755
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,185
- Okay.
- Hello!

756
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,328
Not right now, son.

757
00:38:27,362 --> 00:38:30,164
I'm sorry. Hey, I think you're
missing a shirt, little man.

758
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:32,777
Sorry.

759
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:33,868
Christian!

760
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:35,451
There he goes.

761
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:40,174
Look, it's not fair,

762
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,243
but you're a distraction.

763
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:43,911
It's gonna be impossible to do your job.

764
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:46,614
Then I'll make a statement,
let the people hear from me.

765
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:49,028
Josh, what did the union rep say to you?

766
00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:51,527
Under no circumstances
do you talk to the media.

767
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,653
And this prosecutor,
you don't talk to him alone.

768
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:59,927
And you never deviate from the language.

769
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:02,797
"In the moment of engagement,
I feared for my life."

770
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:05,132
- I did, sir.
- Good.

771
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,767
The truth's easier to remember.

772
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:11,150
Morning.

773
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:12,922
- Have you seen the video?
- Not a good look.

774
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:14,308
I've been in touch
with the governor's office.

775
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:15,743
They want to know who leaked it.

776
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:17,311
Me, too.

777
00:39:17,345 --> 00:39:18,546
I'll be ready in 20 minutes.

778
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,215
Can I ask you a lawyer question?

779
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:22,316
About another case?

780
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,417
Yeah.

781
00:39:23,452 --> 00:39:25,419
- What's the grounds for sole custody?
- For which parent?

782
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:27,588
- Does it matter?
- In some cases, yeah.

783
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:29,723
The father.

784
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,492
Proof the mother is unfit.

785
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:32,927
Drugs, alcohol abuse.

786
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:34,528
Threat to the safety of the child.

787
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:37,231
Pattern of unaccountability.

788
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:38,566
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

789
00:39:40,035 --> 00:39:41,735
You know it didn't mean
anything to him, right?

790
00:39:44,372 --> 00:39:46,574
Didn't mean anything to me, either.

791
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:52,446
Scripture tells us,
"Blessed are those that mourn,

792
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:54,915
for they shall be comforted."

793
00:39:56,418 --> 00:40:00,187
Black America has been
in a state of mourning

794
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:01,288
for far too long.

795
00:40:01,323 --> 00:40:03,624
Mourning the loss

796
00:40:03,658 --> 00:40:07,175
of so many of our sons
and daughters because the world

797
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,239
has weaponized our blackness.

798
00:40:09,264 --> 00:40:10,798
In its eyes,

799
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:12,199
we're never unarmed.

800
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:15,396
And now we add another name.

801
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:17,705
Joey Campbell.

802
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,975
17 years old, killed two weeks ago.

803
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:24,565
We heard about it in the way it's
always been, through whispers.

804
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:27,414
But the world doesn't know.

805
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:31,495
The world doesn't know, because
the police aren't investigating.

806
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:34,776
But the world is gonna know.

807
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:40,740
Church, I'm bringing up someone
who needs our support.

808
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:44,459
Shameeka Campbell, his mother.

809
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:52,773
Family.

810
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:57,000
We know what it's like
to lose someone to the police.

811
00:40:57,025 --> 00:41:00,429
And we also know that two wrongs
don't make a right.

812
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:03,484
Every parent wants their child home.

813
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:09,608
So I'm bringing up another
mother who needs our support.

814
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,368
Come on, church.

815
00:41:21,403 --> 00:41:22,703
The greatest of these is what?

816
00:41:22,737 --> 00:41:24,638
Love. How?

817
00:41:24,673 --> 00:41:27,675
We love our neighbor as ourself.

818
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:31,478
This mother loved

819
00:41:31,513 --> 00:41:34,448
her child no less than anybody else.

820
00:41:34,482 --> 00:41:37,120
Family, let's be united.

821
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,573
Let's get both these murdered children

822
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:42,389
the justice they deserve.
