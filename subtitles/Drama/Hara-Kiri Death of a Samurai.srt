1
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,528
Let me enter. I have come
here today with a request.

2
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,446
Allow me to speak.

3
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,366
Another one?

4
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,806
Will it ever stop?

5
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,566
My liege, what is your bidding?

6
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,808
Where is Omodaka?

7
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,251
He must be present today.

8
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,403
Should I order his
presence, my liege?

9
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,241
No.

10
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,766
It is of no consequence.

11
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,765
Let him in.

12
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,442
You are considering, my liege, receiving
this Ronin (masterless samurai)?

13
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,564
We will listen to
what he has to say.

14
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,241
I was told that you have come to request
use of my premises to commit seppuku?

15
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,251
I come from Geishu in Hiroshima, where I
served my former lord Fukushima Masanori.

16
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,763
My name is Tsukumo Hanshiro.

17
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,241
After the downfall of the clan, I have
been searching elsewhere for a servitude.

18
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,639
But my search remains in vain.

19
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,246
As such we currently live
in times of great peace,

20
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:32,246
I could only lead a life full
of hardship and poverty.

21
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,607
But I could no longer
bear this shame.

22
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,846
I wish to die as a warrior
by eviscerating myself.

23
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,130
For that reason I am before
you most humbly beseeching:

24
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,210
Allow me to fulfill my wish on the
grounds of your inner courtyard.

25
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,162
I have the highest respect
for your sentiments.

26
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,408
As well as empathy.

27
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,931
I have heard that Fukushima-dono's
subordinates have

28
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:11,565
always first and foremost ensured
the safety of their lord

29
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,884
before they surrendered the
fortress of Hiroshima to the enemy.

30
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,567
Thereby allowing the secession
to proceed without conflict.

31
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,207
Truly an exemplary
act of a samurai.

32
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,359
You served the Fukushima clan.

33
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,888
Are you acquainted with a young samurai
among the retainers named Chijiiwa Motome?

34
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,802
I do not know him.

35
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,610
He claimed as you do, to have been
once a retainer of the Fukushima clan.

36
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,359
The rice harvest amounted
to 498,200 Koku yearly.

37
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
There were only 572 retainers
and their subordinates.

38
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,121
And if the members of their
households were to be included,

39
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,049
an uncountable number including
myself had to wander

40
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:10,042
around aimlessly after
the loss of their worth.

41
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,080
Indeed.

42
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,121
At the beginning of autumn
he stood before our gates.

43
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,684
Chijiiwa Motome. A samurai warrior.
One who no longer serves a lord.

44
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,450
He came with the same
request as you do now.

45
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,767
Would you like to
hear his story?

46
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,686
That of his fate?

47
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,522
Please proceed, I am listening.

48
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,809
20th of October, Year
11 of KAN'EI (1634)

49
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,928
Please let me enter.

50
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,125
I have come here today
with a request.

51
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,361
Please allow me to
speak with your lord.

52
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,808
Someone has arrived.

53
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,962
Have you all seen him?
How emaciated

54
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:36,793
and weak he appears before us!
A masterless samurai.

55
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:38,646
It is of no consequence

56
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:43,123
wherever he takes his own life! Especially
when it concerns such a rowdy dog.

57
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,046
The bigger the house of the lord in which
a samurai dies, the greater is the honour

58
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:51,886
accorded to him in death.
- Should we just kill him?

59
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,444
No.

60
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,443
Give him a few coins and send him
away, before it becomes troublesome.

61
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,448
What do you think, Omodaka-dono?

62
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,120
Are you cold? Do you
need anything else?

63
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,242
No.

64
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,010
How old is he?

65
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,046
He appears no more
than twenty, my liege.

66
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,931
He is then younger than you.

67
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,802
This is undoubtedly another ruse,
pretending to request to commit seppuku.

68
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,282
The thought of it
alone angers me

69
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:51,648
that such an unworthy person has knocked
on our clan's door for such a purpose.

70
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,008
- A ruse?
- Indeed, my liege.

71
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,289
It began with an impoverished
Ronin requesting

72
00:10:58,302 --> 00:11:01,322
permission to enter the
house of Fujishima.

73
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,447
He said, "My life is unbearable.
And I wish to end it."

74
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:12,367
Allow me to end my wretched life
here and now upon your grounds.

75
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:15,409
The older samurai at the
gates were so deeply moved

76
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,244
and tried to dissuade
him from his intention.

77
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,322
They introduced him into their ranks,
which then spread like wildfire in town.

78
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,567
As a consequence

79
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:29,360
Many masterless samurai request audience
at the houses of the great lords.

80
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,211
Some would be employed,

81
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:35,170
the others would be
pacified with a few coins

82
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,721
at the very least in order
to save their honour.

83
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,690
What a disgraceful undertaking!

84
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,721
Many Ronin now believe that they would
receive some coins if they threatened

85
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:49,514
to commit seppuku. This man
is another one of them.

86
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:52,329
- Omodaka.

87
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,609
Do you really believe that
this man is playing a ruse?

88
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,242
Indeed.

89
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,129
We must make an
example out of him.

90
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,930
Thereby deterring any more
from knocking on our door.

91
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,924
He is currently
residing in the house.

92
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,488
It is for this reason that
lyi-dono would grant you audience.

93
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,282
He will meet me personally?

94
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,714
Follow me to the baths.
There you will receive the

95
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:15,331
attire with which you are
to present yourself with.

96
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,480
Yes.

97
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,887
Come along and observe.

98
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,926
A truly rare event awaits us.

99
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,762
Watch carefully and observe attentively
what you are about to witness.

100
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,324
Yes.

101
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,243
Omodaka-dono.

102
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,050
Here are his swords.

103
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,447
Inspect them carefully.

104
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,487
With those he intended in all
earnesty to commit seppuku.

105
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,522
Put these on.

106
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,919
Thank you.

107
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,968
When you are done,
proceed outside.

108
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,482
Just a moment! Wait!

109
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,849
Is something the matter?

110
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,404
Am I to meet lyi-dono in funeral attire?
- Iyi-dono?

111
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,645
He had to leave the house
suddenly for an urgent matter.

112
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,643
Your desire has been
presented to him.

113
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,633
He is thoroughly convinced
that you could not

114
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:13,449
be dissuaded from your
honourable decision.

115
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,131
For this reason he asked us

116
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,449
to make all the proper preparations
to fulfill your request.

117
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,608
I implore you.

118
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,728
Allow me some time!

119
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,079
What is the matter?
Are you done?

120
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,084
Everything has been prepared.

121
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,327
You can now commit seppuku.
Just as you have requested.

122
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,364
How do you find it?

123
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,802
What do you think?

124
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,487
What happened afterwards?

125
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,647
My name is Saito Kageyo.

126
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,485
A subordinate of lyi-dono.

127
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,327
This clan has been regarded highly for
the bravery we have shown in battle.

128
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:29,530
But very few remember today the great
battles of Sekigahara and Osaka.

129
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,802
Most of the men present
here are samurai.

130
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,447
But none of them had once
fought for their own lives.

131
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,047
They have no
experience of battles.

132
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,687
The country is peaceful.

133
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,242
In peaceful times such as these

134
00:18:52,243 --> 00:18:54,766
I am deeply moved
by your request

135
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:59,641
to commit seppuku on our grounds,
as a great honour to our clan.

136
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,725
Let these young men bear witness

137
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:11,648
the unique death of a samurai

138
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:14,007
by committing seppuku.

139
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,888
I have assigned Omodaka
Hikukoro as your second.

140
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,130
Matsusaki Hayatonosho has been
appointed as the observer.

141
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,250
To the side is your
assistant, Kawabe Umanosuke.

142
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,044
I ask you: Are you prepared?

143
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,487
Please allow me another request.

144
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,324
That would be?

145
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,681
Please give me one day.

146
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,331
Just one day. No more.

147
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,082
I will return. You have my word.
- Leave it!

148
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,526
- Such pathetic whimpering!
- Just one day!

149
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:20,603
I will come back.
You have my word.

150
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,681
Or even a few hours.

151
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,090
- I beg you.
- Spare yourself the trouble.

152
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,924
This house will not tolerate
a ruse feigning seppuku.

153
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,568
I am not feigning.

154
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,123
I swear to you, I
will commit seppuku.

155
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,089
I beg you!

156
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,529
- Just one day!
- How could you even consider it?

157
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,688
Wait.

158
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,128
It is not that simple.

159
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,553
We have mobilised all
our resources in order

160
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:15,330
to promise you your request
will be fulfilled.

161
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,091
And we have kept our word.

162
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,244
You came to us with
that request yourself.

163
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,721
Just like other clans, our house
keeps strictly to our rules.

164
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,209
A warrior never
changes his mind.

165
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,320
Never.

166
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,324
Have you understood my meaning?

167
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,609
Or perhaps not?

168
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,409
I suggest,

169
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,128
you use your own sword
for this purpose.

170
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,889
A truly impressive
wakizashi (short shord).

171
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,128
Use mine.

172
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,005
- Stop!
- Do not risk it!

173
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,480
I beg you.

174
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,687
Give me three ryo.

175
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,449
I need a physician for
my sick wife and child.

176
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,330
How dare you beg for money?

177
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,726
Have compassion. Just three.
Three ryo.

178
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,844
And thus we hear
your true request.

179
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,041
How shameful.

180
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,962
As a warrior of the
Fukushima clan, I

181
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,442
Chijiwa Motome,

182
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,407
am committing hara-kiri
and leaving this world.

183
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,683
Stab it and turn it to the side.

184
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,808
Do what I say.

185
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,722
Omodaka.

186
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,884
Second.

187
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,284
Turn it around, you coward.

188
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,488
- Do it!
- Turn it to the side!

189
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,763
More. Go on.

190
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,768
Come, turn it around!

191
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,683
A truly sad story
you have told me.

192
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,529
Sad?

193
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,851
And?

194
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,760
Have you changed your mind?

195
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,720
Do you truly believe

196
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,967
that no one would find out?
Disappear. Go.

197
00:32:01,968 --> 00:32:04,361
I would in no way
do such a thing.

198
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,683
A warrior never
changes his mind.

199
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,371
On the contrary. I
will honourably

200
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,162
commit seppuku.

201
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,881
Then so be it.

202
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,770
You should know
what you are doing.

203
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,250
- You would need a new attire.
- No!

204
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,853
That which I now wear
on my back is beffiting

205
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:48,329
for the last days of
an impoverished Ronin.

206
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,688
A last word:

207
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:33,251
You have accorded
me great respect.

208
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,562
And I do not know how I could show
my gratitude for such great honour.

209
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,770
Allow me if possible to
express a final request.

210
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,247
I grant it to you. Speak.

211
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,566
My deepest gratitude.

212
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,801
I would like as my second

213
00:33:56,802 --> 00:34:02,250
Omodaka Hikokuro. That is all.

214
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,290
Omodaka?

215
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,687
His reputation precedes him.

216
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:14,163
He is considered one of the bravest
retainers in the house of lyi.

217
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,521
Indeed.

218
00:34:18,522 --> 00:34:20,488
He is indispensible.

219
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,567
Hikokuro!

220
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,601
Tell me, where is he?

221
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,840
I have not seen him. He has
taken leave of absence.

222
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,923
You heard him. Omodaka
is absent today.

223
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,522
Ono will be your second. He too
possesses extraordinary skills.

224
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:59,124
No. My last wish
shall not be denied.

225
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,407
No.

226
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,049
Bring him here.

227
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,441
I thank you, my liege.

228
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,240
- He did not return last evening?
- Indeed.

229
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:22,481
Go and search for him.

230
00:35:22,482 --> 00:35:24,614
I hope he can justify his absence.
Otherwise

231
00:35:24,627 --> 00:35:26,769
there would be heavy
consequences to deal with.

232
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,727
As you wish.

233
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,081
- Say, there are more samurai missing?
- Indeed, sir.

234
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,929
And I am told of it only now?

235
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,125
And?

236
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,885
Where is Omodaka-dono?

237
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,411
What is not, is not.

238
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,327
What is not, is not.

239
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:59,005
In the case of
Omodaka-dono's absence,

240
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:01,844
I thereby request instead
Matsusaki Hayato or

241
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:05,083
Kawabe Umanosuke as my second.

242
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:13,448
Both of them are also indisposed.
My men are searching for them.

243
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,123
How is that possible?

244
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,843
I do not understand.

245
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:25,323
That has never happened before. None
of the three returned last evening.

246
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,491
Feind!

247
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,369
What have you to do with it?

248
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,607
Wait.

249
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,850
I beg you. Please compose
yourself for a moment.

250
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,650
For I would like to
tell you something.

251
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,803
Something that you have to know.
Indeed, lend me your ears.

252
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:22,441
Afterwards you may tear me
into pieces as you wish.

253
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,164
Step back!

254
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,565
Speak.

255
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,443
I will.

256
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,722
Chijiiwa Motome, who came to you two
months ago, is of some acquaintance to me.

257
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,091
We stood close together in
reality, as you and I do now.

258
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,124
Chijiwa Motome

259
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,922
was of some acquaintance to me.

260
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,602
June, Year 3 of GENNA (1617).

261
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,206
Father?

262
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,086
I have to go back to the castle.

263
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,404
Father.

264
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,441
Miho.

265
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,242
Don't be afraid. Will you
wait for me here alone?

266
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,330
A short break! Rest a while!

267
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,443
Chijiiwa-dono.

268
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,648
How far along are you with the repairs?
The outer wall can wait.

269
00:39:15,649 --> 00:39:18,450
Most important is that the inner
portion is finally finished.

270
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,966
I agree

271
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:24,089
but without the permission of the
Shogunate my hands are regrettably bound.

272
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,526
We have already submitted it six
months ago to the Shogunate.

273
00:39:26,527 --> 00:39:29,808
Be patient. Until then,
just continue as you have.

274
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,644
For a few repairs

275
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:33,881
the Shogun would surely
allocate nothing.

276
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:38,568
And if so, what then? We could
not possibly take such a risk.

277
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:42,007
If we break the bushido code,
our clan will be dissolved.

278
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:45,447
That will not happen. Begin at least
with the works at the citadel.

279
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:48,523
No. We have to wait
first for the permit.

280
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:50,249
We know that!

281
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,891
But it is our duty to guard the fortress.
- But

282
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:55,770
- Go to work, all of you.
- As you wish!

283
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,481
Chijiiwa-dono. What is wrong?
Say something!

284
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,687
Shouldn't you be resting in bed?

285
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,649
It is a crime to be lying
in bed on such a nice day.

286
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,890
Welcome.

287
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,122
What a huge melon!

288
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,603
Compared to yours my sword
is a mere piece of iron.

289
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:02,206
Where did you acquire
such a masterpiece?

290
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,642
It is a gift from our lord.

291
00:41:04,643 --> 00:41:08,281
He has bestowed it to me after
the Battle of Sekigahara.

292
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,368
Allow me a question.

293
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,204
I am slightly concerned.

294
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:18,603
The Shogun has yet to give us his
permission for the castle reparations.

295
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:20,967
I find it very suspicious.

296
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,244
Could it be a conspiracy?

297
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:27,130
One to destroy the clans
which were once enemies?

298
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,421
We have allied ourselves
with him rather late.

299
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:29,726
Hanshiro.

300
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,962
Please don't say such a thing.

301
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:37,364
Surely, that could be
something true indeed.

302
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,560
But what use is it to be
worrying about such things?

303
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,209
Enjoy the finest
pleasures in life.

304
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,123
Jinnai-dono.

305
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,048
She looks more and more
like your late wife.

306
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,689
Admit it. She is more important
to you than your own life.

307
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,603
If one considers that we can't do anything
else in life outside of the battlefield,

308
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:29,322
and that we have
both lost our wives,

309
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:33,450
we haven't done wrong with
bringing up our children, have we?

310
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,241
Motome has grown up
to be a stately lad.

311
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:45,202
Only, unlike myself he seems
to prefer reading and writing.

312
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,842
"The works on the fortress which
have begun without my permission"

313
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:53,411
are considered to
be a crime against

314
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:56,404
the code of the Samurai and
thereby deemed illegitimate.

315
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:58,171
For this reason I have
decreed with the threat of

316
00:42:58,184 --> 00:42:59,961
strict punishment, June,
Year 5 of GENNA (1619)

317
00:42:59,962 --> 00:43:03,521
the aforementioned construction
to be removed from site

318
00:43:03,522 --> 00:43:07,525
and the entire fortress down to the inner
citadel to be destroyed immediately.

319
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:12,401
Disregard of my clear instructions
and thereby insubordination

320
00:43:12,402 --> 00:43:14,767
are an intolerable provocation as well
as an unforgivable insult to my person

321
00:43:14,768 --> 00:43:19,800
and would therefore require
the gravest of consequences.

322
00:43:19,801 --> 00:43:23,885
Each of you are to immediately
vacate the premises

323
00:43:23,886 --> 00:43:27,805
and make way towards Tsugaru.

324
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:31,885
"This is an order which every single one
of you must obey. The Shogun, EDO."

325
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:39,365
I am not worthy to be in
charge of construction.

326
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,731
I should have gone to the
Shogun to commit seppuku

327
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,309
So that the destruction
of the fortress and the

328
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:52,922
dissolution of our clan
could be prevented.

329
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:57,209
The Shogun promotes and disposes
of men, just as he pleases.

330
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,285
Not once did his
advisers contradict him.

331
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,283
What a shame.

332
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,161
Don't close your eyes.

333
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,690
Hanshiro

334
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,122
Rest assured.

335
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,048
If it comes to worst, I will
take your son under my care.

336
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,841
Just like if he were my own.

337
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,126
Hanshiro.

338
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,401
Please forgive me.

339
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,005
Do not say such things.

340
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,522
Please open the door.

341
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,683
I'd like to see the fortress.

342
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,211
How beautiful and stately it is.

343
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:23,610
Indeed.

344
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:39,323
EDO, June, Year 6
of GENNA (1620)

345
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,408
It is just like with studies.
Or with swordfighting. When one

346
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:14,530
works hard everyday, he
would sure make progress.

347
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,605
You two must not worry.

348
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,327
Aren't you eating, Father?

349
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,085
I have to go out for a while.

350
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,242
Then we will wait for you.

351
00:46:54,243 --> 00:46:57,767
No. Go ahead. I am meeting
with an acquaintance.

352
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,853
Go ahead. As long as it's still warm.
Who knows?

353
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:17,250
Maybe the food tastes
nice only when warm.

354
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,409
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

355
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,328
We have no luck today.

356
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,851
I had hoped that we
would catch a carp.

357
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:00,405
The books say that carps
are good for weak people.

358
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:02,289
And especially for weak girls.

359
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,041
Hand it over! Grab the net!

360
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,447
Quick!

361
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,566
We can fry the carp and
give it to Miho-dono!

362
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:22,883
Good.

363
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,609
What a grand house.

364
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,203
It belongs to Lord lyi. We
have allied ourselves with him

365
00:50:09,204 --> 00:50:15,048
before the Battle of Sekigahara. And then
drove the enemy together towards retreat.

366
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,126
One day I would serve in
such a house, and then

367
00:50:20,127 --> 00:50:23,681
I would be able to repay the kindness
Miho-dono and Tsugumo-dono has shown me.

368
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:51,525
May, Year 7 of KAN'EI (1630)

369
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,122
He must marry Miho off.
Otherwise he would never

370
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:24,391
ever get an employment.
Greetings, my child.

371
00:51:24,404 --> 00:51:26,682
- Good day.

372
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,967
You're absolutely right.

373
00:51:28,968 --> 00:51:34,444
He was there again. The director
of merchant-house Koshuya.

374
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,286
Isn't that already
his fifth visit?

375
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:41,444
But most probably the answer
again this time is "no".

376
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,009
You have to finally get
married, Miho-sama. That

377
00:51:45,022 --> 00:51:48,161
would be greatly advantageous
for your father.

378
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,605
We simple folk understand
nothing about such things.

379
00:51:53,606 --> 00:51:58,447
With Samurai is everything
always complicated. Really.

380
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,082
Please excuse me.

381
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,362
I have returned, Father.

382
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,961
Father

383
00:52:33,962 --> 00:52:37,931
I have made more today
than I have expected.

384
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,646
You have brought over a lot of work.
Don't overdo it.

385
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,641
Father.

386
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:26,367
Do not concern
yourself over nothing.

387
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,321
Father.

388
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,244
Rice cake.

389
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,689
Would you like a piece?

390
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,531
Go ahead and eat first, Father.
I will eat mine later.

391
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,684
A delicacy loses its
taste when eaten alone.

392
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,050
Thank you, sir. Goodbye, sir.

393
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,249
To confess the truth:

394
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:41,403
I had been worried
about this thin roof

395
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:45,610
and I am at a loss at what to do.
- I am greatly honoured by your visit.

396
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:47,204
Ah, do not be.

397
00:55:47,205 --> 00:55:52,001
I have not seen you in a
long while, Motome-dono.

398
00:55:52,002 --> 00:55:56,722
I am deeply thankful to you

399
00:55:56,723 --> 00:56:01,009
For using this hut for such a purpose.
- I thank you

400
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,092
For all the kindness you
have bestowed upon me.

401
00:56:04,105 --> 00:56:06,567
- Yes, yes.

402
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,568
That is for you alone. I have
already eaten one with Father.

403
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,403
A delicacy loses its
taste when eaten alone.

404
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,851
What? What is so funny?

405
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,001
I shall pour some hot water.

406
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,807
Uncle.

407
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,682
What has led you here?

408
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,530
Thank you.

409
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,643
Since when have you been
collecting stray cats?

410
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,887
Something is bothering
you, Uncle.

411
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,529
Could you perhaps
imagine marrying Miho?

412
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,087
Miho.

413
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,646
Is that possible for you?

414
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,526
I have no employment.

415
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,285
It is not yet possible for
me to take on a wife.

416
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:33,649
Feelings are all that counts.
What do you feel for Miho?

417
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,088
I will..

418
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,484
For Miho-dono, I will give
up my life to protect her.

419
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,165
- You would?
- Yes!

420
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,288
Upon my word.

421
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:49,170
Motome. Your words
do you honour.

422
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:52,082
What counts is only what
your heart tells you.

423
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:55,008
Understood? Only that matters.

424
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,046
Father!

425
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,453
Give him to me. You are
getting heavier and heavier.

426
01:00:42,466 --> 01:00:44,689
Miho. The food is ready.

427
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:45,727
I'm coming.

428
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,686
Our gratitude, Father. For
giving us this splendid fish.

429
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:59,082
It is of no consequence. Forgive me,
that is isn't much bigger. - It is huge!

430
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,764
Don't exaggerate.

431
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,046
Thank you, Father. We do not know,
for which we have earned it.

432
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,394
What's there to know? He
is after all my grandson.

433
01:01:07,407 --> 01:01:09,762
Don't be so formal.

434
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:15,168
So, Kingo, here we have your
first time eating solid food.

435
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,129
And now open your mouth!

436
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,210
Here.

437
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,401
Open your mouth!

438
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,685
How about some fish, Kingo?

439
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,726
Not for you? Try it.

440
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,881
Kingo!

441
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,407
Now let us eat.

442
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:08,603
Yes.

443
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,002
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

444
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,722
You come later.

445
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,801
I must be gone. I am currently helping
in the temple school of an acquaintance.

446
01:02:29,802 --> 01:02:32,246
Go ahead. And take
care of yourself.

447
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:43,004
Don't stay too long outside.

448
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,969
What is the matter?

449
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:19,163
You have always been sickly as a child.
I hope that doesn't get any worse.

450
01:03:19,165 --> 01:03:20,207
Take care of yourself.

451
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,286
Father.

452
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,491
Please do not be concerned.
I am fine and healthy.

453
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:46,086
Like a fish in water.

454
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,401
Miho.

455
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:56,689
Stop trying to deceive me. When
you need help, just let me know.

456
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,366
Understood?

457
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,124
Yes.

458
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,724
- That is tantamount to extortion.
- Yes.

459
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,848
Furthermore directly
in front of the house!

460
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:19,844
How horrible. You are right.
That is improper.

461
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,684
Tsugumo-sama.

462
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,731
What is the matter?

463
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,559
I would not like to keep you.

464
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,770
But are you perhaps acquainted with
the samurai who lives over there?

465
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:50,085
The young one? Apparently
he had feigned Seppuku.

466
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:52,401
Feigned Seppuku?

467
01:04:52,402 --> 01:04:58,089
Indeed. It is now in trend. Have
you heard nothing of it? - No.

468
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,323
It would never have occured to
us simple folk in our dreams.

469
01:05:01,324 --> 01:05:04,369
Let alone in real life!

470
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:08,445
A samurai requests audience
at a lord's house,

471
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,976
asking to use the premises
to commit harakiri.

472
01:05:10,989 --> 01:05:13,526
Even though he had no
intention to at all!

473
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,488
One hopes for charity.

474
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:20,850
The real trick however is bringing the
lords into a compromising situation.

475
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:37,728
Miho.

476
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,568
Welcome home.

477
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,926
What happened?

478
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,127
Nothing.

479
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,761
The cat is there again.

480
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,281
It has come home
after a long time.

481
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,647
I see.

482
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,202
It came home to die.

483
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,524
It is lying there as usual.
As if in sleep.

484
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,806
Go in. I will do it.

485
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,289
Miho!

486
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,922
Miho

487
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,088
I am fine.

488
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,971
Could you pay more for that?

489
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,770
They are unfortunately
worth not much more.

490
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:45,284
Unlike those which you wear on your belt.
I would gladly buy those swords.

491
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,443
How dare you?

492
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,811
Sadly there is nothing
else I can do.

493
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,046
Wait.

494
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,088
Three pieces for you.
Thank you very much.

495
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,481
Fresh eggs!

496
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,486
Fresh eggs! Eggs! Fresh eggs!

497
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,123
- Come get me!
- You'll get it!

498
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,562
Forgive me.

499
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,490
You need not apologize. Rest.

500
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,606
That was not necessary.

501
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:32,450
You need not worry.
Take your medicine.

502
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,082
And eat something. That
would do you good.

503
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,283
Lie down.

504
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,690
I will bring you to a physician.
He would make you healthy again.

505
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:13,769
A physician? We definitely would
not be able to afford one.

506
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:18,325
I am but a burden to you.
Please forgive me.

507
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,800
It is a man's duty to provide
for his wife and child.

508
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,005
Do you understand?

509
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,721
You and I, we're two
halves of a whole.

510
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,890
Do not concern yourself
with unnecessary matters.

511
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,285
Everything will be better.
Believe me.

512
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,241
Try to sleep.

513
01:14:10,235 --> 01:14:12,451
"Pawnshop"

514
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,402
Thank you.

515
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,809
That would be 50 Mon.

516
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,884
I am feeling much better today.

517
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,210
You have to take it easy.

518
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,364
Father.

519
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,608
How ever could I thank you?

520
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:52,211
You need not thank me, Miho. Rest.
Understand? Sleep a little.

521
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,607
Please take care of yourself, Father.
Living alone as you are.

522
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,001
Do not worry about me.

523
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,282
Please forgive me, for
giving you so much trouble.

524
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,562
Father.

525
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,088
Motome.

526
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,442
Forgive me.

527
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,324
What for?

528
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,688
- What do you speak of, Father?
- Motome.

529
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,525
Forgive me.

530
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,690
I could not do anything.

531
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,967
Miho will get better.
I am convinced of it.

532
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,169
Yes.

533
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,839
Indeed, she will. You are right.
Motome.

534
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,446
I will do everything
in my power.

535
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,763
The fever has not
subsided for three days.

536
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,883
He is very hot. We must
fetch a physician.

537
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:14,763
I have already gone to him. But
he demands three Ryo in advance.

538
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,210
Three Ryo?

539
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,490
Three Ryo.

540
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,531
Three Ryo.

541
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,040
Three Ryo.

542
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,607
Three Ryo.

543
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,324
Motome.

544
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:36,245
How do we get our hands
on so much money?

545
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,524
Father.

546
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:51,924
Would you please stay here and take
care of Miho and Kingo for me?

547
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,248
Leave everything to me.

548
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,604
What do you have in mind?

549
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,765
Rest assured. I will be
back in the afternoon.

550
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:06,889
Be in haste. We must not
lose too much time.

551
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:11,882
Yes.

552
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,086
Kingo.

553
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,089
Hang in there.

554
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,641
Kingo.

555
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:08,081
You must not give up.

556
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,241
Miho!

557
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,962
Kingo.

558
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,889
Are you hungry? Come!

559
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:03,921
Kingo.

560
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,202
Drink.

561
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:07,602
Kingo.

562
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,646
- Why would you not drink?
- Miho.

563
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,684
- Kingo.
- Stop this instant.

564
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,611
Leave him.

565
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:17,567
Miho.

566
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,410
Stop, Miho!

567
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,668
Your breastmilk will
only be detrimental to

568
01:23:22,681 --> 01:23:25,599
him at your current state.
Set him down.

569
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,647
Miho!

570
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,163
Put him back down!

571
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:42,411
Why is Motome taking so long? He
should have been back by now.

572
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,161
Are you all right?

573
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,602
Kingo.

574
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,801
Wait.

575
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,684
Drink.

576
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,971
Drink up, Kingo!

577
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,321
You are the son of a samurai.
Drink!

578
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,400
Come.

579
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,964
I beg you.

580
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,642
Drink something.

581
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,322
Miho?

582
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,480
Miho

583
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,210
Come.

584
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,245
Miho.

585
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,169
Lie down.

586
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:50,210
Why is Motome not back yet?

587
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,002
Kingo!

588
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:10,207
Kingo!

589
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,082
Kingo!

590
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,040
Kingo!

591
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:23,961
Hang on! Kingo. Open your eyes! Kingo.
Come on, wake up! Wake up! Kingo. Wake up!

592
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,246
Kingo!

593
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,646
- Kingo!
- Kingo!

594
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:27,961
Kingo!

595
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,806
Lie down.

596
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:36,565
Do you hear, Kingo? Open your eyes!
Wake up!

597
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:41,082
- Open your eyes, Kingo.
- Kingo!

598
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:42,522
Kingo!

599
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,842
Kingo!

600
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:52,245
Wake up. I beg you. Open your eyes.
Please!

601
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,050
Please!

602
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,521
Kingo!

603
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,602
Stop, Father!

604
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:15,769
Forgive me. I hope
it didn't hurt.

605
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,245
Forgive me.

606
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,846
Forgive me.

607
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,126
Forgive me.

608
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:35,882
Father.

609
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,686
It is my fault.

610
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,601
It is my fault.

611
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:47,802
- Forgive me, Father!
- It is no fault of yours!

612
01:28:47,803 --> 01:28:52,203
- Forgive me, Father.
- Miho! It is not your fault.

613
01:28:52,204 --> 01:28:56,330
- Forgive me, Father.
- No one is blaming you!

614
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:01,087
- Forgive me, Father.
- No one!

615
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,046
No one is blaming you!

616
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,601
Is it Motome?

617
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,728
Motome is back.

618
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:39,883
Is this the residence of
Chijiiwa Motome-dono?

619
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,450
Forgive us, sir. We are
servants from the house of lyi.

620
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,459
Chijiiwa-dono asked for
permission to enter our

621
01:30:13,472 --> 01:30:16,482
gates this morning, in
order to commit seppuku.

622
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:21,771
We have given him our inner
courtyard for his purpose.

623
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,691
Seppuku?

624
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:29,247
Please take this as condolence.

625
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:37,323
We must go. Our task is done.

626
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,009
Wait.

627
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,683
Wait!

628
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,681
Wait! Please wait!

629
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,999
Tell me quickly, how
Motome passed away!

630
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,879
- He committed Seppuku.
- He would never do that!

631
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,006
Our only duty is

632
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:17,482
to return your his corpse.
- I believe none of it!

633
01:33:17,483 --> 01:33:19,767
Tell me the truth!

634
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:23,890
- Tell me what happened!
- It has been decided in our house

635
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:28,808
that feigned seppuku will
no longer be tolerated.

636
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:30,651
Feigned?

637
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,771
Wait! Please wait!

638
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,689
Stay!

639
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:41,371
At first we thought our
superiors would prohibit it.

640
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:45,922
Tell me everything. I want
to know how Motome died.

641
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,611
Forgive me. I know nothing.

642
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,724
Tell me!

643
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:54,521
Here, eat.

644
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,445
It's delicious.

645
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,244
Motome pawned his sword

646
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,605
in order to save the
lives of his family.

647
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:15,729
My sword is for me the
most revered object.

648
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,164
I would never give it to anyone.

649
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,889
The life of a samurai
depends exceptionally

650
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:29,521
on the unforeseeable
changes of destiny.

651
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,607
That which either bring him
to fame or towards downfall.

652
01:38:33,608 --> 01:38:34,647
It is simply that way.

653
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:40,169
Motome could have very
well been one of you.

654
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:44,245
And one of you could have very well
suffered his very same tragic fate.

655
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:52,526
But even though he found himself
in such a difficult situation,

656
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:57,330
and that it is undoubtedly reprehensible
and unforgiveable to feign seppuku

657
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:02,805
in order to take
advantage from it,

658
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:09,121
The request to commit Hara-kiri

659
01:39:09,122 --> 01:39:10,645
with a bamboo sword is mocked

660
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:15,646
while your house is praised for
hosting such a ritualistic suicide.

661
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:22,602
No one here understands with what courage
he drove that bamboo sword into his flesh,

662
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:27,761
in order to bring attention to the agony
eating away at him and his family.

663
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:34,922
I empathize with your pain.

664
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:38,409
He could not be dissuaded.

665
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:42,610
Despite every objection he
insisted on committing hara-kiri.

666
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:46,207
Therefore we provided him our
inner courtyard for his purpose.

667
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:53,005
It was his mistake to think that he would
not have to act on his words till the end.

668
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:58,283
A warrior must kill himself

669
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,523
once he has committed
his word to it.

670
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,447
According to the code, indeed.

671
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:08,490
But had you no
sympathy for a man

672
01:40:08,491 --> 01:40:11,086
who in his desperation stooped
so low as to come to you

673
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:14,687
and beg for charity for
his sick wife and child?

674
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:17,729
Were you so indifferent
to this man's fate?

675
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,846
Is there no one among the
warriors here present

676
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,729
who has enough
compassion in themselves

677
01:40:22,730 --> 01:40:25,121
to put themselves in
Motome's position?

678
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:28,203
Has your stable employment in this
lord's house made all of you blind?

679
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:36,127
We have accorded him all the
respect a warrior deserves.

680
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,924
You speak of compassion? He
would not be discouraged.

681
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:54,164
Is a warrior also not a man with
blood flowing through his veins?

682
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,649
Tsugumo-dono.

683
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,533
We have been forced to teach
a lesson to deter others.

684
01:41:01,546 --> 01:41:03,689
And he was the unfortunate one.

685
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:13,970
Every man has his honour. And a
man without honour is no one.

686
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:19,609
When he lacks the heart
& courage to keep

687
01:41:19,622 --> 01:41:22,642
his honour, he has lost
his worth as a man.

688
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,762
Yes, indeed.

689
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:34,045
Each of our warriors
have such a heart.

690
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:39,603
You claim that none of
your men fears death?

691
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:43,769
Just because they as
samurai possess honour?

692
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,445
And that they would sacrifice their
life to maintain this honour?

693
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,843
It is as you say.

694
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,404
Tsugumo-dono.

695
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:15,250
There is nothing
left to be said.

696
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,687
The three of them have
not been sighted since

697
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:46,809
they left their quarters last evening.
There are no traces of them.

698
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,724
- You have yet to find them?
- Indeed, sir.

699
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:53,361
- Go and search further.
- As you wish.

700
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:24,450
What has happened to my men?

701
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,123
Take these back.

702
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,484
It is of no worth
to me any more.

703
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:02,200
I have something else. Something
which would like you to have.

704
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:19,725
Matsusaki Hayatonosho's topknot.

705
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:25,166
Kawabe Umanosuke's topknot.

706
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:34,610
And Omodaka Hikokuro's topknot.

707
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:52,288
You could return these,
if you so desire,

708
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:54,806
to the missing men.

709
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:01,889
Without their topknots
your three warriors

710
01:45:01,890 --> 01:45:05,965
fear treading outside, where
people could see them.

711
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:11,441
The head is still intact.
But the face has been lost.

712
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,525
Who are you?

713
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,605
Who are you? State your name!

714
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:43,120
Chijiiwa Motome. Does that
mean anything to you?

715
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:02,051
They are ashamed that
instead of their lives

716
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:04,611
only their topknots have
been taken from them.

717
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,252
Since then they have
hidden themselves from

718
01:47:07,265 --> 01:47:09,568
the world and dare not
leave their hole.

719
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:20,081
You spoke of honour. What of it?
Of a samurai's honour?

720
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,830
As all of you could see,
that honour you speak of is

721
01:47:23,843 --> 01:47:25,924
nothing at all. Meaningless!
Nothing but a farce!

722
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:29,204
Your honour is but a farce.

723
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,244
Kill him.

724
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:04,447
Whoever speaks of
honour should know

725
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:06,498
that it is not something that
a samurai puts on the line.

726
01:55:06,511 --> 01:55:08,570
- Silence!

727
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:33,490
Have you lost your mind?

728
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,807
Do you really believe
that I have lost my mind?

729
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:56,886
I have only lived

730
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:05,649
every year waiting for spring.

731
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:51,364
You bastard!

732
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,486
Father!

733
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,651
Get inside!

734
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,367
We have found them!

735
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:49,924
We have restored everything
to its proper place.

736
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:53,891
Just as you have ordered.

737
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:19,811
Has it been thoroughly polished?

738
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:22,162
Indeed.

739
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:26,570
The red armour

740
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:32,007
is the pride of our noble house.

741
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:51,300
