{3420}{3505}Do you have some valid reasons|for wanting a divorce?
{3590}{3640}Excuse me.
{3660}{3730}My sinuses are very sensitive to irritants.
{3755}{3800}Mm!
{3847}{3912}In the past five months,...
{3915}{4040}..I think I've breathed freely,|with both sides working, maybe a week total.
{4042}{4130}I gotta cut this out. It's gonna kill me.
{4285}{4347}I hadn't smoked for 13 years.
{4402}{4470}I kept the last cigarette from my last pack.
{4502}{4580}I said if I never smoke this One cigarette...
{4582}{4640}..I'll never smoke again, period.
{4672}{4735}13 years I kept that cigarette.
{4775}{4825}Here.
{4892}{4960}I had this little case made for it.
{4960}{5010}See?
{5090}{5140}13 years.
{5197}{5267}And then, one Thursday afternoon,...
{5302}{5352}..Barbara came to see me.
{5390}{5465}And when she left...
{5557}{5622}you know where I am|if you change your mind.
{5945}{6000}Barbara and Oliver Rose.
{6047}{6167}you'd have heard of 'em, except I kept|what happened out of the papers.
{6170}{6265}I think you should hear the story, though.|It might matter to you.
{6267}{6335}I won't start the clock yet.
{6335}{6400}My fee is $450 an hour.
{6402}{6520}When a man who makes $450 an hour|wants to tell you something for free,...
{6522}{6580}..you should listen.
{6647}{6715}They met... Great.
{6717}{6765}They agreed on that.
{6767}{6885}But, the way I saw it,|the poor bastards never had a chance.
{6960}{7040}It was the final day of the season|in Nantucket.
{7087}{7180}A nor'easter was blowing|the last of the tourists off the island.
{8640}{8780}The next item up for bid|is an exquisite Japanese carving, circa 1700.
{8782}{8885}A rare relief of a Shinto goddess,|very richly detailed.
{8887}{8955}- The intricacies of the Orient...|- $10!
{8955}{9035}I have $10 from the premature young man|in the grey raincoat.
{9047}{9092}- Do I hear 15?|- 11.
{9095}{9175}$11. Ladies and gentlemen,|please, do I hear 15?
{9177}{9290}- 20.|- $20. I have $20, ladies and gentlemen.
{9290}{9370}Do I hear 25 for this|exceptionally exotic item?
{9372}{9430}- $30.|- 31.
{9432}{9560}$31. All right, I have $31,|ladies and gentlemen. Is this my final offer?
{9562}{9615}Ladies and gentlemen, 31, going once...
{9615}{9720}- $40.|- $40! 40. Do I hear 45?
{9722}{9840}- 50. Five-0.|- $50. I have $50. Do I hear 60?
{9860}{9950}- $50, going once. Going twice.
{9950}{10032}Sold... to the pretty lady in the white sweater.
{10100}{10185}- Do you know how much it's worth?|- Doesn't matter. I'm not selling.
{10185}{10235}$250.
{10262}{10312}Well, I guess I have a good eye.
{10315}{10365}I gotta catch the last ferry.
{10367}{10450}Wait a minute. Let me carry that for you.|Here. Put this on.
{10452}{10477}Oh!
{10502}{10577}- I love the rain.|- God, I love it, too.
{10647}{10755}I know what you're thinking. Harvard Law,|woo, woo, woo! But I got a scholarship.
{10770}{10840}I'm not rich or anything. I'm brilliant.
{10842}{10900}- What about you?|- I'm not rich or brilliant.
{10900}{10995}- Where are you going to school?|- Madison. I got a scholarship. Gymnastics.
{10997}{11070}I don't know, though.|My body's getting kinda big.
{11072}{11117}It looks, uh...
{11120}{11190}Like a pendulum -|the longer it is, the slower you move.
{11190}{11285}My vaults and tumbling aren't what|they were. My strength moves are good.
{11287}{11347}your strength moves?
{11585}{11645}- I love Nantucket.
{11700}{11750}Oh! I'm gonna miss the ferry.
{11795}{11867}- Thanks for walking me. Bye.|- Wait! What's your name?
{11887}{11937}Barbara!
{11967}{12030}Barbara!
{12032}{12095}Wait a second! I've got a great idea!
{12140}{12190}-
{12435}{12492}I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
{12512}{12602}Never, never, never apologise|for being multiorgasmic.
{12630}{12695}I honestly didn't know I was.
{12725}{12775}Oh, bless you!
{12865}{12915}Bless you.
{13155}{13215}If we end up together,...
{13215}{13310}..then this is the most romantic day|of my whole life.
{13337}{13395}And if we don't,...
{13395}{13445}..then I'm a complete slut.
{13610}{13695}This is the story|we're gonna tell our grandchildren.
{14002}{14055}- Uh-oh.
{14082}{14132}Uh-oh!
{14155}{14255}It's the return of the bald avenger.
{14472}{14522}-
{14625}{14675} And a happy New Year
{14680}{14795} We wish you a merry Christmas|We wish you a merry Christmas
{14800}{14915} We wish you a merry Christmas|On Sesame Street
{14915}{14995}OK, that's the sixth time.|Now turn it off, honey.
{14997}{15050}Merry Christmas, Bird.
{15052}{15105}-
{15265}{15357}- Honey, give me those papers.|- Say please.
{15405}{15460}- Please.|- No.
{15665}{15745}- Where are they?|- I don't got.
{16010}{16070}- Nice try.|- Thanks.
{16107}{16165}-
{16220}{16305}Hello! Mom's home!
{16307}{16392}- Get over here, you squeezy! Squozy!
{16395}{16450}Ohh, up we go!
{16452}{16487}Come on, you.
{16540}{16587}- All right.|- Hi, honey.
{16590}{16650}Yeah, now you go in that chair. Got it?
{16652}{16725}Well, you're gonna go in this one, lady.
{16732}{16837}- Hey! I got you...|- Is that for me?
{16840}{16897}- There's green for you.|- Oh, thanks.
{16900}{16955}And it's red for you.
{16957}{17037}- It's not a good idea to give them sweets.|- Oh, no. It is.
{17040}{17137}I read that kids who are deprived|of sweets and candies all the time,...
{17140}{17210}..they get obsessed by it|and they turn out to be obese.
{17210}{17295}Kids who get it all the time,|it's no big deal - they turn out normal.
{17295}{17340}And... here.
{17342}{17435}Being a waitress on Christmas Eve's|very profitable.
{17472}{17542}- What do you think, guys?|- Ah! Nice!
{17545}{17595}OK.
{17632}{17715}I have to put it on the tree! Josh, look!
{17800}{17850}What do you think?
{17852}{17902}Hmm...
{17927}{18015}- Looks like tin foil.|- No, you're right. It doesn't make it.
{18017}{18067}I'll learn.
{18090}{18147}- Let's go for a walk.|- I gotta finish this.
{18150}{18240}- Just a quick stroll. Come on.|- It's freezing outside. It's snowing.
{18240}{18307}Yes. And I'm still asking you to take a walk.
{18310}{18355}Why, huh?
{18357}{18410}- Where are we going?|- Just to the corner.
{18410}{18517}Barbara, I have work to do.|I can't be walking around here in the snow.
{18595}{18685}OK, we're at the corner.|So what do you wanna do now? Walk back?
{18687}{18780}- No, I wanna go for a ride in your car.|- I don't have a car.
{18897}{18940}- You got me a Morgan?|- Yes!
{18942}{18980}Oh, ho, ho!
{18982}{19075}I don't believe it! A Morgan! A Morgan!
{19077}{19192}- The cook's brother brought it from England.|- It's got a little rust. I'll restore it.
{19195}{19260}- How much you pay?|- It's a present. I used my money.
{19260}{19317}Your money is our money.|Can we afford this?
{19320}{19430}You are gonna be so successful, this may be|our last opportunity to worry about money.
{19432}{19535}Come on! Here. Get in.|It's a right-hand drive.
{19557}{19650}- Well, are you happy?|- I'm more than happy. I'm way past happy.
{19652}{19702}I'm married.
{20142}{20220}Sounds like a fairy tale, doesn't it?
{20222}{20272}And it was.
{20320}{20440}My father used to say: "There are four things|that tell the world who a man is."
{20442}{20542}"His house, his car, his wife, and his shoes."
{20567}{20672}Oliver didn't have the house yet,|but he was definitely moving up in the world.
{20675}{20735}He'd only been with the firm six months...
{20735}{20840}..when he decided to have the senior partners|over to his new apartment for dinner.
{20840}{20900}He had his eye on the future.
{20902}{20947}So did I.
{20950}{21032}Pretty lady, lovely lady
{21055}{21125} May I have this dance with you?
{21162}{21195} Can I hold...
{21265}{21315}Ah, what a night!
{21347}{21402}Elke, Elke. Wait a minute.
{21405}{21480}We're eating with elderly people now.|Keep that closed.
{21482}{21547}- Where you been? Come on!|- Oliver, this is Elke.
{21550}{21592}- Elke, this is Oliver.|- Hi.
{21595}{21637}Come on. Come on.
{21640}{21710}Here is to Oliver and Gavin...
{21710}{21797}..for a job well done|on Kentucky versus Brunswick Coal.
{21800}{21825}Hear, hear!
{21827}{21880}- Hell of a litigation.|- Thank you.
{21880}{21935}I couldn't have done it without you, Oliver.
{21937}{22022}This man has a face|juries can't help but believe.
{22045}{22135}Gavin told the state attorney general|that if he didn't settle,...
{22137}{22197}..next election he'd be running as a gelding.
{22200}{22245}-
{22245}{22302}Well, let's drink up.
{22360}{22447}- Good night, Mom.|- Oh! Good night, sweethearts.
{22450}{22485}- Mom?|- Yeah?
{22487}{22542}Can I take some more dessert to our room?
{22545}{22600}OK! Time for bed. Let's go.
{22602}{22685}- Guess not.|- Kiss... Kiss.
{22687}{22740}Kiss Daddy.
{22740}{22802}- Good night, sweetheart.|- Good night.
{22815}{22870}- Good night, buddy.|- Good night, Dad.
{22870}{22910}Sleep well.
{22977}{23037}I used to be chubby as a kid. Yeah.
{23040}{23102}- Let's eat.|- Yeah.
{23315}{23372}Oh, my!
{23382}{23432}Whatever flavour is this?
{23450}{23565}No, don't tell me. Let me think now. Uh...
{23592}{23675}- It isn't apples.|- You make something with apples.
{23677}{23745}- No. Unless you mean baked apples?|- Prunes?
{23747}{23845}No. Wait a minute. Um...|This is a very special taste...
{23847}{23922}- Raisins!|- It isn't pears.
{23985}{24090}Um... fresh fig with, uh... a little cognac.
{24102}{24252}- Figs! I never would have thought of figs!|- I never would have guessed.
{24260}{24365}- Mm. It's fantastic, isn't it, Elke?|- Mm-hm.
{24365}{24420}It's absolutely spectacular.
{24422}{24505}- Mrs Marshall, more wine?|- Please.
{24522}{24577}- Your crystal is lovely.|- Thank you.
{24580}{24635}- It's not Waterford.|- Baccarat.
{24690}{24747}Then we are paying our associates too much!
{24750}{24800}-
{24820}{24875}Actually, we got it quite reasonably.
{24875}{24952}It's... It's kind of an interesting story.
{24970}{25032}Why don't you tell it, Barb?
{25142}{25210}-
{25290}{25350}Well... we were in Paris...
{25357}{25407}It was our fifth anniversary.
{25410}{25442}Mm.
{25445}{25565}We'd had lunch in this wonderful place in|the market district, called the Pa-day Crishon.
{25567}{25630}- Pied de Cochon.|- Thanks.
{25632}{25722}We were wandering around|and we came upon the...
{25732}{25797}..Rue de Paradis,...
{25800}{25885}..where the Baccarat|has its factory and museum.
{25885}{25952}I didn't know about this before I met Oliver.
{25962}{26025}My mother bought her glasses at the A&P.
{26025}{26132}You know, the kind with the raised flowers|that always chipped off after a few weeks.
{26135}{26200}- They were always yellow, remember?|- Heh-heh-heh!
{26200}{26320}Anyway, here we were in this immense room|filled with all that Baccarat had ever made.
{26322}{26445}A field of crystal. It was so... so pretty.
{26455}{26505}I mean, I felt...
{26562}{26615}..whatever the word.
{26615}{26705}And suddenly, from the next room,|we heard the sound of glass breaking.
{26705}{26820}Well, I looked at Oliver and Oliver|looked at me, and then... Oh, ye... No.
{26822}{26895}Before that,|there was this big, black limousine.
{26897}{26970}Now, this is important.|Well, before the limousine...
{26972}{27075}To make a long story short, a couple|had ordered a design for their anniversary.
{27075}{27135}When it was ready,|they were getting a divorce.
{27137}{27185}The woman had smashed her half,...
{27187}{27275}..and I convinced the man to sell us|his half cheap -just to spite her.
{27277}{27340}Heh-heh-heh-heh!
{27382}{27482}And, uh... that's our Baccarat story.
{27747}{27820}Well, I think everybody|had a great time, don't you?
{27820}{27947}- To make a long story short, no.|- I'm sorry. you were just rambling on...
{27950}{28047}Tell your own story next time you care|so desperately what everybody thinks.
{28050}{28100}Fuckface!
{28127}{28195}- They're my bosses.|- They're Gavin's bosses, too.
{28195}{28260}It didn't stop him|from getting a footjob at dinner.
{28262}{28385}Gavin doesn't care about making partner.|He doesn't have a wife and kids. I do.
{28447}{28500}You wanna keep living in this apartment?
{28502}{28590}Because you do not buy a house|on an associate's salary.
{28592}{28665}At least, not the kind of house that we want.
{28667}{28760}OK, I care what they think.|I care, all right? I care.
{28785}{28835}Shoot me.
{28837}{28895}And that phoney laugh.
{28897}{28972}- "Heh-heh-heh..."|- That was a genuine laugh.
{28975}{29022}"Heh-heh-heh-heh..."
{29025}{29090}OK. All right, all right! Maybe I overdid it.
{29110}{29180}I was just trying to keep things going.
{29367}{29450}God, I hope they didn't notice|what a jerk I am.
{29480}{29540}They never seem to.
{29587}{29637}-
{29740}{29790}"Dear Homeowner,...
{29790}{29852}..I love your house!"
{29855}{30005}"If you ever consider selling,|please... contact me."
{30005}{30050}"Barbara Rose."
{30050}{30140}Mom! I'm gonna be late for practice!
{30142}{30215}You've been doing this for a year|and nobody's called.
{30217}{30300}This is a great house. I love this house.
{30302}{30352}It's a waste of time.
{30355}{30422}I bet I get this house. Five bucks.
{30425}{30475}Five bucks.
{30622}{30665}Man...!
{30752}{30820}- Hello.|- Oh! I was just leaving a note.
{30822}{30887}How kind. Please, won't you come in?
{30890}{30940}All right.
{30987}{31052}-
{31135}{31195}I don't believe we've met.
{31197}{31252}- Barbara Rose.|- I'm Maureen.
{31255}{31365}I don't remember Mother mentioning you,|but she had so many friends.
{31420}{31485}Oh! Oh, I'm very sorry.
{31485}{31550}Thank you. She went peacefully.
{31552}{31610}What am I going to do with this old place?
{31610}{31750}I just can't bear to put it up for sale and have|a bunch of strangers tromping through it.
{31752}{31860}If I could just find someone|who would love it as much as Mom did.
{31862}{31962}That's more important to me|than whatever money we get for it.
{31965}{32022}If you know anybody|who might be interested...
{32055}{32182}Can we go up and pick our rooms?|- We can do whatever we want. It's our house.
{32185}{32255}Who gets first pick? As if I had to ask.
{32280}{32360}Oh, don't get scared. We'll do it together.
{32362}{32415}I just feel kind of strange.
{32417}{32480}I mean, this house is so beautiful...
{32482}{32532}..and we live here.
{32535}{32607}This is who we are? This is me?
{32707}{32732}Mmm!
{32735}{32787}- I'll be home early.|- Where are you going?
{32790}{32880}To work. I wish I didn't have to,|but somebody's got to pay for all this.
{32882}{32965}- It's Saturday.|- Come on, this is a great day.
{32995}{33055}You got the fun part!
{33250}{33300}Kitchen first.
{33382}{33442}Everything was working for the Roses.
{33462}{33512}Let me restate that.
{33535}{33610}The Roses were working for everything.
{33612}{33717}Over the next six years, Oliver dug in.|Made senior partner.
{33720}{33787}The kids lopped off 70, 80 pounds.
{33790}{33852}And Barbara laboured seven days a week...
{33855}{33955}..to create the perfect home|that Oliver always dreamed of.
{33970}{34035}Not easy for a girl who grew up|drinking her milk...
{34037}{34115}..from glasses with chipped, yellow flowers.
{34115}{34225}There were a million choices...|and she sweated every one of 'em.
{34240}{34305}She refinished all the tables herself.
{34305}{34397}It took six months|to get the floors exactly right.
{34407}{34512}A hundred Sundays to find the perfect|Staffordshire figures and plates...
{34515}{34580}..that she put over the fireplace.
{34582}{34642}When you work that hard on something,...
{34645}{34755}..eventually you have to finish|and face the awful question:
{34755}{34805}"What's left to do?"
{34945}{35000}- Are you working?|- Yes. Is it important?
{35002}{35075}Yes. Kind of. I hope so.
{35100}{35187}Stephanie Mayes called|to say thank you for dinner the other night.
{35190}{35280}She said the pâté I made was so good|I should go into business.
{35282}{35355}So I asked her if she really meant it|and she said she did,...
{35357}{35425}..so I took a pound over to her|and collected $35.
{35460}{35550}I'd almost forgotten|what it felt like to make money.
{35552}{35660}- You sold liver to our friends?|- She paid me in cash, Oliver.
{35662}{35760}Somehow that felt different|from the money I get cashing a cheque.
{35762}{35865}It made me feel like...|trading in the Volvo on one of those...
{35865}{36000}..four-wheel drive things with the big,|knobby tyres and the 200-horsepower engine.
{36000}{36067}So I did. I'm gonna pick it up tomorrow.
{36115}{36175}Thank you so much for telling me.
{36207}{36322}And you think that you... need this?|I mean, the Volvo was a fine car.
{36332}{36425}- I'll pay for it with my own money.|- How much does it cost?
{36427}{36525}All right, I know it was kind of crazy|but I just... wanted it, OK?
{36550}{36605}25,000.
{36642}{36737}So you only have to sell|700 more pounds of pâté.
{36767}{36847}Maybe I will. Maybe I'm starting a business.
{36885}{36980}- But if you don't want me to, uh...|- No. No, no, no, no. you do it.
{36982}{37032}Do it. Do it.
{37207}{37257}I'm doing it.
{37352}{37387}-
{37395}{37490}Wait a minute. Wait one minute.|I do not understand. What's the, uh...
{37492}{37550}..what's the attitude?
{37550}{37600}I told you I would handle it.
{37602}{37720}Yeah, and I didn't see anything happening|so I went to Ed and I set up the interview.
{37722}{37825}- I would have done it.|- Yeah, but sometimes you need a little push.
{37845}{37905}We all need a little push.
{37937}{38000}We agreed that,|if you're doing this liver bit,...
{38002}{38080}..we would need someone|to take care of the house, right?
{38082}{38132}Right, Oliver. Right again.
{38135}{38245}Oh, come on. Let's not argue, OK?|Just think about it for a minute!
{38335}{38427}If you don't want to interview the lady,|I will send her home.
{38430}{38507}I'm only trying to make your life easier.
{38680}{38782}Somehow the thought of a stranger living|in my house just seems weird, you know?
{38785}{38865}Doesn't it? I don't mean just for us,|but for you, too.
{38880}{38955}- Oh, but then I guess you do this all the time.|- No, no.
{38965}{39067}I try this as a means of finding|room and board and a little money.
{39092}{39185}I'm also attending a few classes|at William and Mary College.
{39197}{39277}- But that won't interfere with my duties.|- Well...
{39280}{39340}That's great. I'm happy for you - really.
{39350}{39447}- So, do I get the job?|- The fact is, Susan, I don't need a live-in.
{39482}{39532}This was my husband's suggestion.
{39535}{39625}I have raised two kids on my own|and now they're about to go off to college.
{39627}{39715}- They were both accepted at Harvard.|- Mm, that's a nice school, too.
{39717}{39755}Thanks.
{39755}{39822}So anyway, it'll just be|Oliver and me here at home.
{39825}{39895}Although I am getting going|my own catering business.
{39897}{39965}But let's face it,|I don't need to work for the money.
{39967}{40075}And that does not make me one of these|women who is married to a successful man...
{40075}{40152}..and has dedicated her life|to him and her children...
{40155}{40277}..and then has to validate herself as a human|being, because her children are leaving her,...
{40280}{40340}..by studying photography|or opening an art gallery...
{40342}{40440}..or going into interior design|in her husband's office. No!
{40457}{40555}I have a wonderful house,|crammed with beautiful things.
{40555}{40640}I did this house myself. I did a great job.
{40642}{40715}Not that I am necessarily|a slave to materialism. No.
{40740}{40835}But I am proud|of what I have accomplished,...
{40835}{40962}..although I suppose some people find my life|disgusting. Disgusting is too strong a word.
{40965}{41092}No, I would not say that many people|would respect the choices I have made,...
{41095}{41170}..although women would. Women like me.
{41197}{41290}But then I don't care what they think|because I can't stand who they are.
{41292}{41387}What I'm trying to say, Susan,|is that I don't need a live-in.
{41460}{41597}Well... thanks for the interview|and good luck, and God bless you.
{41617}{41670}I would like you to understand...
{41672}{41755}..that, if I were to hire you,|my life would probably change.
{41757}{41817}you would be this new element in the house.
{41820}{41870}-
{41872}{41922}Well...
{41940}{41992}Let me show you where your room is.
{42172}{42257}Hey. Hey! Hey, Bennie. Dumb dog.
{42460}{42497}Hey, Bennie!
{42500}{42570}- Come on. Let's see if he'll go for it again.
{42570}{42645}Bennie! Hi-yah!
{42700}{42750}Yeah, dumb.
{42830}{42885}-
{43045}{43142}Oh, the Bennie boy.|The Bennie-Bennie-Bennie boy. Yes.
{43145}{43217}He's the best boy. He's the best boy!|We love our good boy.
{43220}{43270}He's a good boy! We love our Bennie boy.
{43272}{43330}Yes, a pretty dog! He's a pretty dog!
{43927}{43987}-
{43995}{44055}Rose residence.
{44057}{44142}- Susan, is that for me?|- It's for Josh.
{44145}{44232}- Are you expecting a call?|- Jason Larrabee said he'd confirm lunch.
{44235}{44300}I'm trying to land him as a client.
{44302}{44390}The word around town is he's up|for a Cabinet post. I wish he'd call.
{44395}{44457}He will.
{44505}{44575}Did you get a chance|to look over that contract for me?
{44577}{44670}- What contract?|- On the consulate luncheon I'm doing.
{44685}{44772}- Oh, yeah. No, but I'll read it this weekend.|- OK.
{44780}{44835}No. No, not OK.
{44835}{44940}I have to sign it tomorrow. I gave it|to you last week, but it's probably fine.
{44942}{45015}- I'll read it now.|- Oh, no, don't bother.
{45022}{45072}No. Get it.
{45157}{45207}Sure.
{45480}{45535}What? What is it?
{45535}{45585}It's a fly. Where'd it go?
{45615}{45665}On the fridge.
{45700}{45765}Stay upwind of him.
{45835}{45905}Aha! How about that?
{45940}{45992}Not bad, huh?
{45995}{46077}- I admire your technique.
{46142}{46175}Hello.
{46177}{46287}Mr Larrabee, hi. How are you?|No! No, no, it's not too late.
{46290}{46370}Could you hang on just one second|while I use the other phone?
{46380}{46427}Thank you.
{46502}{46567}Yes, sir. I'm looking forward to that, too.
{46582}{46640}No, no, no. Course you're not bothering me.
{46642}{46707}Lawyers, we never sleep. Heh-heh-heh!
{46747}{46800}I'm available to you, sir, 24 hours a...
{46955}{47015}-
{47295}{47387}Who left the appliances on in the kitchen?|It sounds like who knows what!
{47390}{47515}I must have hit some switches when I was|cleaning up. You know how that can happen.
{47517}{47567}I got great news.
{47570}{47622}Lunch is on tomorrow with Larrabee.
{47650}{47735}I'm gonna meet him|at his club in Philadelphia.
{47735}{47785}He's mine!
{47787}{47862}Look how crazy you are|about yourself right now.
{47865}{47932}- I'm sorry.|- Don't apologise.
{47935}{48065}I live with the assumption that all guys|owe an apology to the woman they live with.
{48097}{48135}You're so full of shit.
{48162}{48240}So, where's that little contract of yours?
{48242}{48317}Maybe I can up your price, huh?
{48320}{48370}Where is it?
{48385}{48447}- You sure it's all right?|- My fee's going up.
{48450}{48507}Better get me while you can afford me.
{48605}{48680}- I don't want you to read it.|- Let me have it.
{48860}{48917}I got you|and I'm not gonna let you get away!
{48920}{48967}-
{48970}{49020}Let me go.
{49020}{49080}Let me go! Let go!
{49132}{49182}Let go of it! Let go!
{49205}{49255}-
{49340}{49390}Ah, Jesus!
{49417}{49480}Whoo! Whoo, whoo!
{49482}{49532}- Ooh!
{49642}{49722}You think you're pretty strong,|don't you?
{49905}{49970}What the hell is wrong with you?
{50082}{50185}If you're with a woman for any length of time,|eventually you'll ask her that question.
{50185}{50247}If she doesn't answer, that's trouble.
{50250}{50360}And when trouble begins, it comes at you|from directions you'd never expect.
{50360}{50402}Oliver was a sitting duck.
{50405}{50480}I think you're gonna be|very well served by our firm,...
{50480}{50537}..especially if the rumours are true.
{50540}{50642}Well, there may be a Senate|confirmation hearing in my future.
{50645}{50740}- We could definitely be of help with that.|- Yes. Waiter... Ohh!
{50742}{50820}- What's the matter?|- Nothing. I'm fine.
{50822}{50902}- Could I have some more coffee, please?|- Certainly, sir.
{50905}{50967}Regarding your Senate confirmation,...
{50970}{51070}..it may not be a bad idea for us|to have your personal asset liability...
{51072}{51105}-
{51107}{51162}- Oliver?
{51165}{51230}Do you think you're having a heart attack?
{51317}{51397}- Call an ambulance!|- Wipe that stuff off his chin.
{51400}{51460}- Hang in there, Oliver.|- Call my wife.
{51462}{51512}-
{51635}{51685}You're doing just fine.
{51687}{51780}- Somebody called for the defibrillator.|- Right here.
{51880}{51935}How's it goin'?
{51935}{52000}You may be the only person|I'm doing better than.
{52042}{52107}The wife stabbed me in the stomach.
{52140}{52205}With a nail file this time.
{52207}{52265}- She's training to be a manicurist.|- Oh.
{52265}{52387}- They make good money, you know?|- I'm trying to get a doctor for you, babe.
{52390}{52440}They always feel bad after.
{52442}{52507}Mr Rose? I'm Dr Gordon.|This is my associate.
{52510}{52595}- Dr Hillerman. Jason Larrabee called us.|- How are his vital signs?
{52597}{52670}- We were here first.|- We'll be with you in just a moment.
{52672}{52765}Babes, take it easy.|Can't you see the guy's dying over here?
{52767}{52817}- Did someone call my wife?|- Yes.
{52820}{52912}I need to write her a note...|in case she doesn't get here in time.
{52915}{52990}- Let's get him to CICU.|- Jeff, let's go.
{53025}{53077}I'll get the pen back once we get there.
{53130}{53185}- Is my wife here?|- I don't think so.
{53185}{53212}-
{53215}{53277}Get me some pictures. Upper GI.
{53280}{53420}You're gonna have to swallow some barium.|But you'll like it. It's peppermint flavoured.
{53472}{53540}Nothing is more important|than the hors d'oeuvres.
{53540}{53602}That's where people|make their first judgment.
{53605}{53707}Perdóname, señora. La señora Rose|ha recibido una llamada urgente.
{53710}{53780}- There's an urgent phone call for you.|- Oh.
{53815}{53850}Hello?
{53850}{53895}Oh, God!
{53897}{53967}Oh, my God! All right. I'm leaving right now.
{53982}{54067}- My husband's had a heart attack.|- That happened to my mother.
{54070}{54187}Don't worry. your luncheon's gonna|be terrific. Everything's gonna be great.
{54205}{54310}The x-rays showed an oesophageal tear.|It's commonly known as a hiatal hernia.
{54315}{54357}Right there.
{54360}{54417}The pain symptoms are identical to angina.
{54420}{54500}Stress, coffee, spicy foods, gas.
{54502}{54622}Your nerve endings get irritated. You know|what that's like. Not pleasant, but not fatal.
{54625}{54680}Could you get this hiatal hernia, say...
{54682}{54770}..by being squeezed|between someone's legs?
{54825}{54855}No.
{54855}{54940}- So I'm not going to die?|- Eventually, but not today.
{54940}{54990}-
{55025}{55080}Thank you.
{55132}{55190}- You can wait right here.|- Thank you.
{55337}{55395}Oliver! You're alive!
{55395}{55492}Yeah, it was something else.|It wasn't the heart, it was a rip. A tear.
{55495}{55545}You're alive!
{55562}{55635}- So what are you gonna do?|- Wait for Barbara to pick me up.
{55635}{55692}- I'll wait with you.|- Good.
{55752}{55877}Think we can get that nurse to come|back here with a bottle of musk oil?
{55965}{56035}- She should be here any minute.|- Yeah.
{56155}{56215}It's stuffy in these places.
{56507}{56597}- I got us enough booze for the whole trip.|- Thanks.
{56600}{56707}I couldn't remember whether you wanted|a twist, so I got you some just in case.
{56710}{56760}Thank you, Gavin.
{56865}{56922}- Salud.|- Salud.
{57175}{57232}All those lives going on out there...
{57235}{57352}People we'll never meet...|experiencing things we'll never know.
{57387}{57450}We can't know.
{57450}{57595}In your own life, by this point,|you think you know what's gonna be but...
{57610}{57685}- But you don't know.|- You don't know.
{57727}{57802}It's always just when you think|you got it figured out...
{57805}{57905}..when, bingo, something comes along|and knocks you right on your ass.
{57927}{58015}Why do you think Barbara|didn't come to the hospital?
{58040}{58137}I don't know.|She probably had a good reason.
{58712}{58762}-
{58810}{58870}Hiya, Bennie. Come here, sweetheart.
{58900}{58972}Where is everybody, huh?
{58975}{59087}I guess you're the only one who|gives a damn about me in this family.
{59420}{59470}-
{59610}{59640}Oliver!
{59640}{59725}You don't know how happy I am to see you!
{59770}{59852}- You didn't come to the hospital.|- No.
{59855}{59920}No. Well, I called and...
{59920}{60002}..well, everything seemed to be...|under control.
{60005}{60067}I just... I didn't want to disturb you.
{60070}{60170}Disturb me?|Well, I wasn't doing much. Just dying.
{60172}{60230}Oliver! You weren't dying.
{60250}{60325}- You didn't even call.|- Of course I did. I talked to someone.
{60327}{60395}- Not to me.|- Well, I talked to a nurse and...
{60397}{60452}..she said that you weren't dying.
{60455}{60517}Well, I thought I was dying!
{60590}{60685}I wrote you a note...|in case you didn't get there in time.
{60780}{60845}I can't read your handwriting.
{60867}{60992}I was on a gurney being rushed|to Intensive Care in excruciating pain.
{61025}{61075}It says:
{61110}{61222}"My love, by the time you|receive this, I may be gone."
{61225}{61290}"My life was... fun...
{61290}{61365}..full... beyond my dreams."
{61452}{61545}"All I have... and all I am, I owe to you."
{61602}{61687}"You gave me courage|to surpass what I know I am,...
{61690}{61740}..the strength to..."
{61760}{61817}Oh, this is where I had a spasm.
{61820}{61912}Uh... I can't read it, but the next line says:
{61915}{62012}"I lie here, feeling my life ebb away."
{62040}{62100}"I cling to your image."
{62102}{62165}"I will take you with me to eternity."
{62210}{62260}"I cherish you."
{62320}{62382}"I thank merciful God for you."
{62450}{62512}I didn't have the strength to sign it.
{62617}{62682}I'm... I'm sure they, um...
{62702}{62775}..they would've told me who it was from.
{62915}{62985}I can't believe|you didn't call us at school, Mother.
{62985}{63100}I didn't see any point in alarming you until|there was something to be alarmed about.
{63175}{63255}Your mother|didn't want to disturb anybody today.
{63265}{63330}Yeah, well, you still should have called.
{63360}{63410}You should have.
{63412}{63487}I'm sure your mother didn't want|to worry you needlessly.
{63490}{63560}The important thing is your father is alive.
{63745}{63817}We've always been a family|that communicated.
{63820}{63922}If anything important happens,|everyone should know about it.
{63955}{64010}That's the rule.
{64062}{64112}Yeah.
{64240}{64355} Only you
{64357}{64500} Can make this world seem right
{64525}{64667} Only you, and you alone
{64680}{64832} Can thrill me like you do
{64840}{64922} And fill my heart with love
{64925}{64950}-
{64952}{65075} For only you...
{65122}{65172}-
{65205}{65280}- What's going on?|- I'm very upset.
{65385}{65482}It's 3 o'clock in the morning.|Turn the television off.
{65557}{65655}I wasn't sure why I didn't go to the hospital,|but now I think I know.
{65657}{65722}I'd just like to put today behind us, OK?
{65725}{65775}OK.
{65840}{65930}I was gonna drive to the hospital,|but I knew you were OK.
{65955}{66105}Cos I never think that anything really terrible|could happen to me or the kids or you.
{66145}{66205}And I was getting on the expressway,...
{66207}{66302}..and suddenly I had|this very strong feeling that you were dead.
{66340}{66432}And I knew what it would feel like|to be alone in this house,...
{66435}{66485}..to not have you in my life.
{66507}{66587}And I got so scared, I had to pull over.
{66600}{66650}Oh.
{66685}{66760}Well, you don't have to be scared any more.
{66845}{66897}I got scared because I felt happy.
{67320}{67382}You were happy because I was dead?
{67407}{67472}I was happy to be free.
{67475}{67540}Like a weight had been lifted.
{67565}{67635}- Like a weight had been lifted?|- Yeah.
{67697}{67812}So, how am I supposed to respond?|You tell me you wished I was dead?
{67830}{67900}I thought it was important.
{68080}{68137}-
{68577}{68652}I think you owe me an apology, Barbara.
{68655}{68732}If you have something to say,|I'd like to hear it.
{68862}{68920}I want a divorce.
{69017}{69070}No, you don't.
{69072}{69125}You can't have one!
{69160}{69220}I've thought about this a lot.
{69222}{69285}I really don't want|to be married to you any more.
{69475}{69535}Why do you want a divorce?
{69537}{69635}Did... did I do something?|Did I... did I not do something?
{69675}{69740}I can't give you specifics, Oliver.
{69775}{69840}- Well, try!|- I don't want to try!
{69965}{70042}Is there somebody else? Another man?
{70050}{70085}No.
{70085}{70155}- A woman?|- You wish.
{70180}{70230}I should be the one asking for a divorce!
{70232}{70297}I was rushed to hospital|suffering from severe...
{70300}{70365}- Indigestion.|- Oh-hoh-hoh...
{70370}{70455}Oh, you're such an expert|at making me look like ajerk.
{70470}{70535}OK, OK, OK. I'm sorry.
{70537}{70615}I'm the bad person.|Let's just blame me for this.
{70620}{70695}No! No. I think I need...
{70697}{70747}I think you owe me,...
{70750}{70855}..after this many pretty goddamn good|years of marriage, a solid reason.
{70855}{70960}I worked my ass off to make enough money|to provide you with a good life,...
{70962}{71032}..and you owe me a reason that makes sense.
{71055}{71145}So let's hear it.|Come on. Let's hear it. Let's hear it!
{71167}{71227}Because...
{71230}{71292}..when I watch you eat,...
{71295}{71357}..when I see you asleep,...
{71360}{71422}..when I look at you lately,...
{71425}{71480}..I just wanna smash your face in.
{71570}{71680}Come on, smash my face.|Come on. You wanna smash my face?
{72125}{72200}The next time... I hit back.
{72270}{72357}And you'd better get yourself|a damn good lawyer.
{72375}{72440}The best your money can buy.
{73025}{73077}- What does she want?|- Child support.
{73080}{73127}I've always taken care of my kids.
{73130}{73230}And they will be 18 in one year,|which makes it nice for you.
{73232}{73375}- What about alimony?|- Barbara, against my advice, waives alimony.
{73375}{73480}I'm making money with my business.|I get a lot of referrals. I can support myself.
{73487}{73540}Well, I'm a lucky guy.
{73542}{73612}My client is being more than fair, Mr Rose.
{73615}{73730}She's waived alimony and she's willing to|waive her rights against your law practice...
{73732}{73862}..in exchange for the house and all of|its contents, except your shaving gear and...
{73880}{73937}..his clothing?
{73945}{74045}- Everything I made went into that house.|- I found that house.
{74047}{74140}Every piece of furniture is where it is|because I put it there. It is my house.
{74140}{74215}If your client has finished yammering,|explain to her...
{74217}{74315}..that a wife does not|automatically get the house.
{74325}{74450}I thought you told her that|she was entitled to anything and everything.
{74452}{74515}- I told her what?|- Yes.
{74540}{74587}Here it is.
{74590}{74647}I quote: "My love,...
{74667}{74725}..by the time you..."
{74725}{74775}Boy, what a handwriting.
{74790}{74882}"By the time you receive this, I may be gone."
{74900}{74962}Uh... Blah, blah, blah...
{74980}{75095}"All I am and all I have, I owe to you."
{75132}{75197}You wrote this, Mr Rose?
{75260}{75407}Excuse me, Mr Thurmont, you tiny,|little, worm-like, infinitesimal prick,...
{75410}{75497}..could I have a word with my wife, please?
{75520}{75567}Certainly.
{75672}{75755}If this is a who-can-sink-lowest-fastest|contest, you won.
{75780}{75832}By showing him my letter,...
{75835}{75945}..you have sunk below|the deepest layer of prehistoric frog shit...
{75947}{76012}..at the bottom of a New Jersey scum swamp.
{76090}{76165}I may have let you have the house,|but now...
{76165}{76220}..you'll never get it.
{76222}{76292}You will never get that house.
{76315}{76370}Do you understand?
{76392}{76475}You will never get that house.
{76555}{76660}- We'll see.|- Yeah... we'll see.
{76902}{76962}Maybe I shouldn't have|let you see that letter.
{76965}{77027}Dear girl, by the time this is all over,...
{77030}{77107}..you'll think of today|as one of your lighter moments.
{77175}{77215}-
{77225}{77332}What do you call 500 lawyers|at the bottom of the ocean?
{77335}{77392}An excellent start.
{77435}{77502}I used to resent jokes like that.
{77545}{77610}Now I see them as simple truths.
{77660}{77725}- Lawyers...
{77805}{77857}Hello.
{77860}{77932}Honey, I can't talk right now.|I'm with a client.
{77935}{78007}Love you, miss you, want you... Bye!
{78110}{78165}I recently married.
{78212}{78337}Which is the last thing I ever thought|I'd do after what happened to the Roses.
{78340}{78462}When it comes to women...|I hope I'm a better man now than I was.
{78507}{78602}I know I'm a better lawyer,|when it comes to divorce.
{78635}{78730}I'll never make another mistake|like I made with Oliver.
{78777}{78845}Let's just concentrate on the job at hand.
{78847}{78900}She wants the house. You want the house.
{78912}{79002}- I'm the one who's living in a hotel room!|- Not for long.
{79005}{79080}- She claims she found the house.|- She did find it, right?
{79080}{79190}Yeah, but that's not the point. She says|she made it what it is. She didn't. She didn't.
{79200}{79310}I'm not keeping score but, if I were,|it'd be about 83 to 6 in my favour.
{79312}{79370}Of all the really... good stuff.
{79372}{79445}Those wonderful Staffordshire dogs...
{79445}{79560}In fact, most of the Staffordshires, I found.|And that Art-Deco rug and, uh...
{79560}{79665}And that stove in the kitchen? She wouldn't|have bought it if I hadn't pushed her!
{79675}{79730}Shoes. That's what she's good at buying.
{79732}{79825}I gotta have shelves in the closet|or she'd have them all over the place!
{79832}{79902}Here we go. You're gonna love this.
{79905}{79985}Civil Code, Title 16-9-0-4, Section C.
{79987}{80115}I used this once for a freebie divorce|I did for my cousin Paulie. Total loser.
{80115}{80152}Read.
{80155}{80235}"For the purposes of subsections|one and two of paragraphs..."
{80237}{80330}Here. Skip down to...|"Parties who have pursued separate lives..."
{80330}{80422}"Parties who have pursued separate|lives sharing neither bed nor board...
{80425}{80475}..shall be deemed to have lived apart...
{80477}{80560}..even though they reside|under the same roof..."
{80610}{80675}Even though they reside|under the same roof?
{80677}{80747}Yeah. The law was put on the books|for poor people:
{80750}{80840}folks who couldn't afford|separate residences. But we can use it.
{80845}{80925}- So I can move back in.|- If your divorce is settled in court,...
{80927}{81040}..it shows you're committed to the property.|Plus, you can see she doesn't sell the assets.
{81042}{81100}I can work on her,|get her to fold on the house.
{81102}{81195}No. No, Oliver, you don't even|deal with her. You avoid her.
{81197}{81247}Women can be a lot meaner than we think.
{81250}{81322}Never underestimate her as an adversary.|Don't talk to her.
{81325}{81400}No, no, no, I won't. Don't worry about me.
{81402}{81495}- Gavin... thank you.|- All right.
{81517}{81612}- All right, go on. Go home.
{81620}{81715}- This is the stupidest thing you've ever done!|- Second stupidest.
{81717}{81785}- You can't stay here!|- The law says I can.
{81785}{81880}Title 16-9-0-4, Section C.
{81907}{81972}Look it up, tootsie pie.
{82002}{82057}-
{82110}{82170} Tis the season to be jolly
{82170}{82227} Fa la la la-la la-la la-la
{82230}{82305} Don we now our gay apparel...
{82307}{82355}OK, Mom, you're on.
{82410}{82460}Let me see that bag.
{82685}{82760}Is that what you're gonna put on top?
{82762}{82810}- Yes, it is.|- Fine.
{82810}{82885}- Josh, plug it in, please.|- All right.
{83302}{83352}- It's a short.|- It's not a short.
{83355}{83430}One of the ornaments|is touching the sockets.
{83517}{83580}Fine.
{83582}{83652}You take care of it, Oliver.
{83750}{83825}Come on, it's Christmas time.|Let's get festive.
{83847}{83922}- I have to go out.|- I got stuff I gotta do in my room.
{84477}{84550}- Oh, God, my house is on fire!|- Mine too, babe!
{84552}{84607}Really, you idiot!
{84682}{84725}Wait up, babe!
{84747}{84790}Oh, my God!
{84797}{84840}Omar, do something!
{84840}{84890}- Fire!|- Mom!
{84892}{84952}Fire! Fire!
{84970}{85025}Call the police! I'll get the extinguisher!
{85025}{85105}991. 999. 911.
{85135}{85185}- Stay out of the way!|- Coming through!
{85185}{85287}"One: store in a cool place.|Two: hold upright, pull pin out." OK.
{85290}{85377}- "Three: stand back, aim away from face."|- Do it!
{85380}{85455}- Dad, hurry!|- All right! OK, OK! All right. OK, OK.
{85562}{85622}Dad! The curtain!
{86035}{86105}It's over. Thank God I was here!
{86135}{86185}The whole house could have gone up.
{86187}{86295}OK, OK. I'll get a sponge|and start cleaning up.
{86312}{86385}Maybe a rake... or a bulldozer.
{86887}{86940}It might not have been the lights.
{86965}{87025}You always know.
{87490}{87595}Rather than argue about who supposedly|did what, I'd like to reach some accord.
{87597}{87670}- Time is passing.|- I'd love to be done with this, too.
{87672}{87765}Right. If we leave settlement to the court,|the lawyers get everything!
{87765}{87822}So I've come up with a fair solution.
{87825}{87875}- You wanna hear it?|- Yes.
{87875}{87987}Now, I understand your point of view.|you've invested 18 years in this marriage.
{87990}{88100}That's worth a lot.|A tremendous amount. $163,800.
{88125}{88200}- How did you arrive at that number?|- Fairly.
{88200}{88315}- You do almost the same things as Susan.|- No! She's in college. She should make more.
{88317}{88355}Barbara!
{88357}{88450}There is no comparison whatsoever|between what she does and...
{88452}{88535}Her salary is a base, so I doubled it.
{88535}{88600}And that wasn't enough,|and then I tripled it,...
{88602}{88672}..and that's how I came up with this figure.
{88675}{88765}$490,633, approximately.
{88767}{88830}I shall give you that in cash. It won't be easy.
{88832}{88895}It'll be harder than hell,|but I'm gonna do it.
{88897}{88982}You just have to, you know,|agree to give up the house.
{88985}{89085}You owe me. You've gotten more out of|knowing me than I've got out of knowing you.
{89087}{89215}I'm not even gonna ask you what that means.|I found this house! I bought everything in it!
{89217}{89307}With my money! It's a lot easier to spend it|than it is to make it, honeybun!
{89310}{89382}You might not have made it|if not for me, sweet cakes!
{89385}{89447}You weren't even multiorgasmic|before you met me!
{89475}{89540}You expect me to keep|reassuring you sexually,...
{89540}{89605}..even now when we disgust each other?
{89715}{89770}-
{89835}{89920}Don't let this bother you.|It's all gonna work out.
{90027}{90095}The red areas are hers.
{90097}{90160}The yellow areas are mine.
{90162}{90210}Green is neutral.
{90222}{90332}The kitchen was difficult, but Barbara|came up with the idea of time allotment.
{90370}{90437}This seems rational to you both?
{90455}{90505}Yeah.
{90537}{90587}Oliver, my father used to say...
{90590}{90680}..that a man could never outdo a woman|when it came to love or revenge.
{90680}{90787}Why don't you let her have the house?|There are other houses. And other women.
{90790}{90897}No, no, no. I'm going to win because|I've got her to accept the ground rules.
{90900}{91020}Oliver, there is no winning in this.|It's only degrees of losing.
{91060}{91130}I got more square footage.
{91300}{91350}-
{91420}{91470}-
{91740}{91852}Sorry to disturb you, but I was wondering|if I could borrow a sleeping tablet.
{91885}{91972}- Did Oliver send you for it?|- No. Actually, no.
{92042}{92092}All right, you got me there.
{92095}{92175}Which is good,|because I'm uncomfortable with the charade.
{92185}{92287}It's nice to see somebody|still caring for somebody in this house.
{92307}{92390}- Good night, Susan.|- So, there will be no pills?
{92405}{92482}- Oh, kitty. Kitty, wait.
{92485}{92535}Kitty, kitty...
{92957}{93032}Do you want me to call around|to find an open drugstore?
{93035}{93082}I'll find one.
{93115}{93180}- Should I come?|- It's up to you.
{93205}{93272}- These are my favourite kind of cars.|- It's a Morgan.
{93275}{93327}Of course.
{93505}{93560}-
{93562}{93612}-
{93655}{93712}It's cosy.
{94100}{94145}-
{94162}{94220}- What was that?|- A bump of some sort.
{94325}{94387}Oh, Kitty! Oh, mein gott.
{94512}{94627}Look, why don't you go into the house|and find a large Ziploc bag?
{94630}{94697}- Ziploc?|- Yeah.
{94710}{94777}Oh, kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty.
{94780}{94842}So much for the nine lives myth.
{95180}{95247}Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
{95250}{95275}Pss, pss, pss!
{95277}{95317}Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!
{95320}{95357}Here, puss, puss, puss!
{95370}{95420}Here, puss, puss, puss!
{95422}{95467}Pss, pss, pss.
{95470}{95555}Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.|Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
{95580}{95637}Have you see my cat?
{95640}{95705}Are you talking to me?
{95927}{95997}Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come on, kitty.
{96000}{96055}Here, puss, puss, puss, puss.
{96057}{96122}Where are you, kitty? Come on!
{96125}{96177}Here, kitty, kitty!
{96180}{96227}Come on, kitty, kitty. Come on.
{96230}{96280}Here, puss, puss, puss.
{96282}{96380}Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty...
{96775}{96860}- What did you do with my cat?|- You're letting the heat out.
{96915}{97022}I know something happened. Instead|of playing this game, what happened?
{97025}{97107}- You killed your cat, Barbara.|- What?
{97145}{97252}Yes. One damn Dalmane|and your kitty would be alive.
{97255}{97387}I had to get up in the middle of the night,|looking for Sominex, and I backed out the...
{97560}{97627}-
{97905}{97965}That supposed to scare me?
{98060}{98132}If you're looking for trouble, Barbara,|you found it!
{98427}{98472}Oh, God.
{98475}{98522}Oh...
{98730}{98780}-
{99062}{99165}What do you expect?|You killed my cat! You're making me nuts!
{99165}{99222}Will you please...? I'm asking you to leave!
{99250}{99310}No, it's my house...
{99312}{99382}..and I'm going to stay.
{99595}{99660}-
{99662}{99722}-
{99867}{99962}Frankly, I'm concerned|about you, Oliver. You look haggard.
{100015}{100070}I feel great.
{100072}{100152}I'll take time off|after the Larrabee confirmation hearings.
{100155}{100212}Why don't you take time before?
{100220}{100322}It's vital to the firm this comes off|without a hitch. I want you at your best.
{100325}{100347}-
{100350}{100440}I'm at my best. I won't let you down.
{100442}{100505}I'm in fantastic shape.
{100550}{100602}I thank you so much for caring.
{101370}{101450}- Mr D'Amato. There's someone in your office.|- Who?
{101482}{101550}- Use words, Mary Ann.|- Mrs Rose.
{101552}{101655}I didn't think I should leave her|in reception. What with all the... you know.
{101657}{101727}Yeah, I know... Yeah, I know!
{101805}{101862}Barbara.
{101892}{102000}You really shouldn't be here because|it might be viewed by some as unethical.
{102005}{102097}Well, I am here... ethical or not.
{102180}{102237}You don't mind if I tape this...
{102240}{102335}..just so no one gets confused|about what was said?
{102412}{102470}What's on your mind?
{102492}{102607}Well, since you're the one|who advised Oliver to move back in,...
{102610}{102670}..I thought you would advise him|to move out.
{102677}{102745}Why? Sounds like you two|have things worked out,...
{102747}{102812}..with the red areas and the green areas.
{102815}{102910}Gavin, ever since this thing started,|I've had trouble sleeping.
{102927}{102995}Most mornings I wake up sobbing.
{103005}{103057}I'm sorry. That's shitty.
{103072}{103152}But this morning... I woke up screaming.
{103177}{103230}And I couldn't stop.
{103232}{103337}I need this to end. This has to end!
{103347}{103407}- I suggested selling the house...|- No!
{103432}{103505}OK. You both seem to agree on that.
{103512}{103557}Gavin.
{103560}{103662}I don't have much money,|but I could pay you.
{103695}{103760}That'd be illegal.
{103970}{104025}Besides money,...
{104107}{104202}..what would it take|to get you to help me, Gavin?
{104230}{104322}Put your shoes on, Barbara.|I haven't been into feet since '82.
{104325}{104397}- Have you ever made angry love?|- Is there any other way?
{104400}{104427}Hey, hey!
{104447}{104507}Stop it!
{104510}{104587}This is ridiculous. Button up!
{104590}{104697}You wanna settle this? Let's all sit down|and work it out, find some compromise.
{104710}{104787}- There is no compromise.|- Then I can't help you.
{105025}{105075}Worth a shot.
{105290}{105352}You know where I am|if you change your mind.
{106172}{106272}Sometimes I wonder what might have|happened... if I'd taken her offer.
{106330}{106377}But I didn't.
{106427}{106547}I should have seen her toes|in the pit of my crotch as a cry for help.
{106587}{106637}- Stinking bitch.|- Dumb bastard.
{106640}{106680}- Slut.|- Scum.
{106682}{106730}- Filth.|- Faggot.
{106732}{106775}- Morning, Susan.|- Morning.
{106777}{106862}-
{106950}{107022}- I made you some sandwiches for the trip.|- I'm not hungry.
{107025}{107112}You may be hungry later.|Why don't you wrap these up?
{107172}{107265}There's some things I should tell you.|You're going off to college.
{107267}{107327}- You told me you loved me.|- Yes, I do love you.
{107330}{107440}And about drugs - don't do 'em. And sex -|don't catch anything. What else is there?
{107442}{107502}Just... about women.
{107547}{107597}Don't be led by your emotions.
{107625}{107745}Just cos you screwed up doesn't mean I will,|so don't try and put your shit off on me.
{107747}{107817}Josh. Don't leave like this.
{107835}{107927}- I'm pissed at you!|- So what do you want to do about it?
{107930}{107985}You wanna take a swing at me?
{108010}{108097}Is that gonna make you feel better?|Then go ahead.
{108347}{108432}What are you and Dad gonna do|to each other once we're not around?
{108435}{108480}Don't be silly.
{108482}{108560}Your father and I need some time alone|to work things out.
{108585}{108657}By the time summer school starts,|we'll have it settled.
{108660}{108772}Then I'll make a celebration dinner|and I'll bring it up - or you can come here.
{108775}{108830}We'll work it out.
{108832}{108887}- You promise?|- Sure.
{108935}{108990}You know I love you.
{109017}{109092}- My sweet girl.|- So...
{109095}{109145}I'll be back for my things.
{109150}{109215}I will be thinking the best for you.
{109252}{109302}So long.
{109305}{109375}- Take care, Susan.|- Goodbye!
{109547}{109620}- You have a great time, kids.|- Don't worry about us.
{109622}{109672}Bye!
{109795}{109842}Here, Bennie.
{110090}{110212}At 15, I became an evolutionist,|and it all became clear.
{110215}{110260}We came from mud.
{110260}{110385}And after 3.8 billion years of evolution,|at our core is still mud.
{110410}{110465}No divorce lawyer can doubt that.
{110545}{110647}We can nail her. She's having|a black-tie dinner at 8 o'clock tonight.
{110650}{110727}The food critic from The Post|called to confirm the time.
{110730}{110797}She sent me this phoney|exterminator's notice...
{110800}{110902}..saying the house is being gassed|for termites, so I'd stay away.
{110905}{111015}- She can have dinner parties.|- She lied about the exterminator.
{111015}{111062}She can lie.
{111065}{111127}She took two of my Staffordshire figures.
{111130}{111197}Any dealer would give you|at least $1,000 for them.
{111200}{111262}She is financing her dinner with my things.
{111265}{111352}I want to file criminal charges|and I want her thrown in jail.
{111370}{111480}- Unless you have proof, there aren't grounds.|- Wait a minute. Whose side are you on?
{111482}{111530}Did she get to you?
{111532}{111592}- Did you bang her?|- Not at all!
{111637}{111722}She was great. She was a gymnast.
{111790}{111845}She was?
{111865}{111920}Yeah.
{111922}{111977}Look, Oliver...
{111980}{112025}I lost my train of thought.
{112027}{112082}Come on, Gavin. Let's have her arrested.
{112085}{112197}I don't think you should stay in the house.|Sell the house and divide the proceeds.
{112220}{112342}No. You're selling me out. You don't|think I got the guts to go to the mat.
{112345}{112400}You don't want to go to this mat, Oliver.
{112402}{112517}Look. I respect you, Oliver.|You're a professional. I'm a professional.
{112520}{112607}As a professional and a friend,|I'm telling you, one way or another,...
{112610}{112670}..you're gonna lose. Give it up.
{112705}{112755}I understand what you're saying.
{112845}{112895}You're fired.
{113050}{113115}Now, some of the dishes tonight are new.
{113115}{113182}Some, I've no doubt made for you before.
{113185}{113327}But they are all my favourite dishes|as you are all my favourite clients.
{113425}{113487}Hello, darling. Sorry I'm late.
{113505}{113625}Well, I guess I'd better not sit too close|to anybody because I have a bit of a cold.
{113627}{113677}Atchoo!
{113680}{113727}-
{113972}{114027}-
{114030}{114102}Now I guess I'll go in and piss on the fish.
{114275}{114365}Oliver, these people are my clients.|you are messing with my business.
{114367}{114442}I have the food editor|from The Post out there.
{114460}{114512}Is everything all right?
{114605}{114702}- I would never humiliate you like this.|- You're not equipped to, honey.
{114910}{114970}Leaving so soon, baby doll? Huh?
{114980}{115035}A family tiff seems to be developing.
{115037}{115167}I don't know if we should leave, but|I definitely advise skipping the fish course.
{115170}{115217}-
{115430}{115470}No!
{115660}{115730}What...? What...? What are you doing?
{115732}{115792}What...? What are you doing?
{115822}{115900}Do you see what she's doing?|Do you see that?
{116100}{116180}-
{116632}{116665}-
{117192}{117255}-
{117597}{117665}Get out of the car, hon.
{117727}{117782}you're gonna have to kill me.
{117845}{117897}I mean it, Oliver.
{117900}{117957}You don't have the guts!
{117965}{118025}Come on. Come on!
{118755}{118812}This is absurd. It's just absurd.
{119295}{119345}OK, the gloves are off.
{119440}{119510}Look, I don't wanna create a scene.
{119512}{119590}I mean, I, uh,|live in this neighbourhood, too.
{119590}{119642}But the gloves are off!
{119825}{119875}Chickenshit.
{119915}{119962}-
{120367}{120432}Your guests would have loved this.
{120552}{120630}I expected a little more imagination|from you, Ollie.
{120757}{120815}Guess I'll go clean up.
{121055}{121102}-
{121342}{121402}Not the Staffordshires.
{121457}{121542}- You love them as much as I do.|- More.
{122460}{122515}Don't you touch that.
{122567}{122617}What are you doing?
{122810}{122855}- Give that to me!|- Let go!
{122857}{122905}- Give it to me!
{122987}{123037}Ugh!
{123145}{123195}Good night.
{123700}{123750}Bennie?
{123797}{123842}Bennie!
{123845}{123910}-
{123912}{123962}Bennie?
{124165}{124270}The Bermuda high-pressure system is|keeping hot weather in the Potomac area.
{124272}{124322}Look for a high today of 92 degrees.
{124325}{124382}Not a good day|to do strenuous exercise.
{124385}{124472}Good advice, especially|if you have respiratory problems.
{124475}{124527}Sara Murphy is at the Pentagon...
{124530}{124615}..with a report on whether women|still find uniforms sexy for men.
{124617}{124687}So far, it was a pretty normal|divorce scenario.
{124690}{124782}A few bruises, some broken dishes,|a pissed-on fish.
{124785}{124880}But I think you should have|a drink for this next part.
{124920}{125032}There are two dilemmas...|that rattle the human skull.
{125035}{125092}-
{125095}{125182}How do you hold onto someone|who won't stay?
{125217}{125312}And how do you get rid of someone|who won't go?
{126507}{126587}I opened a great old one, to let it breathe.
{126727}{126785}You look beautiful.
{126797}{126850}- I feel good.|- I do, too.
{126852}{126932}The Larrabee confirmation hearing|went very well today.
{127002}{127125}I was surprised, happily surprised,|by your invitation.
{127167}{127267}Thank you for the wine.|I hope it's not poisoned.
{127560}{127610}Same here.
{128565}{128635}- We've made a mess of things, Oliver.|- We sure have.
{128650}{128752}- I want to start living a normal life again.|- I do too, Barbara.
{128765}{128892}Sitting here like this,|it's... it's hard to believe we can't be happy.
{128915}{128997}We can be happy... just not together.
{129020}{129092}I want to ask you one last time to leave.
{129140}{129210}I can't do that. I won't.
{129252}{129312}You make so much money, Oliver.
{129315}{129380}You can buy another house|and replace everything.
{129385}{129435}Except you.
{129455}{129577}You may find this hard to believe...|but I still love you.
{129580}{129642}I still...
{129645}{129692}..want you.
{129735}{129850}- I find it hard to believe.|- What you can't believe is I don't want you.
{129905}{129990}Well, I... Yeah, I have|a problem with that. I mean,...
{129992}{130050}..I think I'm a good person, as people go...
{130115}{130185}What can we do to patch things up?
{130227}{130302}- I don't know.|- Tell me.
{130305}{130367}- I can't.|- Please.
{130370}{130462}- I don't know.|- Please tell me. Please?
{130465}{130522}- Just tell me.|- Stop it!
{130590}{130650}I guess you don't wanna talk about it.
{130652}{130705}No, I don't wanna talk about it.
{130707}{130750}Oliver,...
{130752}{130870}..if you don't get out of here now,|you have no idea how far I'll go.
{130875}{130922}How far? Tell me.
{130925}{131007}We've been horrible to each other,|but we had something - we still do.
{131010}{131065}We haven't passed any point of no return.
{131097}{131182}- I have.|- I'm not convinced.
{131185}{131275}Nobody who makes pâté this good|can be all bad.
{131295}{131345}-
{131397}{131480}That depends on what the pâté is made of.
{131727}{131782}Woof.
{131990}{132032}Bennie?
{132102}{132165}A good dog to the last bite.
{132350}{132410}Goddamn you!
{132460}{132525}Jesus Christ!
{133402}{133510}-
{133630}{133680}-
{133752}{133802}I'll give you the chandelier.
{133847}{133910}-
{134205}{134250}Barbara?
{134285}{134322}Shit!
{134325}{134422}You can't get out!|I'm gonna find you, sweetness.
{134435}{134490}I know this house too well!
{134522}{134572}Where the hell is she?
{134650}{134700}-
{134777}{134840}-
{136717}{136792}I guess I'm on top now. And you're helpless.
{136812}{136880}I can do anything I want.
{136882}{136930}Stop it! I mean it! Stop it!
{136932}{136982}-
{137022}{137115}Oh! Oh, God. Oh, you smell so dirty-sweet.
{137170}{137247}Oh, Barbie... Oh, we need this, Barbie. Yeah...
{137250}{137300}No, don't talk!
{137302}{137357}Don't talk. Oliver,...
{137380}{137487}..I want to say hello to the|bald avenger. Please.
{137562}{137615}You haven't called him that in years.
{137617}{137667}-
{137685}{137757}Oh, Barbara! Oh, Barbara! Oh!
{137805}{137852}Oh, yes!
{137855}{137905}-
{137947}{138015}Oh, Barbara... Ba...
{138017}{138107}-
{138120}{138202}Oh, God! Agh!
{138555}{138607}Was it as good for you as it was for me?
{138650}{138700}-
{138800}{138850}-
{138890}{138945}-
{139035}{139092}-
{139662}{139715}Oh, what's going on here?
{139742}{139797}-
{140300}{140350}Oh!
{140380}{140420}-
{140560}{140610}Oh, I'm sorry.
{140612}{140662}I thought you were Barbara.
{140680}{140767}Mr Rose, what's going on here? Are you OK?
{140790}{140847}I'm... I'm fine. Fine.
{140875}{140920}Listen, Susan,...
{140920}{141025}..I'm in the middle of something now.|I... I... I really can't talk about it.
{141027}{141075}Let me get the door for you.
{141077}{141165}- Is Mrs Rose all right?|- Yes, she's fine.
{141190}{141277}Where is she? Is she OK?|You're sure she's all right?
{141280}{141367}Barbara. Susan's here!
{141370}{141455}- She wants to know if you're OK.|- Never better.
{141560}{141617}Thank you for dropping by, Susan.
{141635}{141692}Come outside with me, Mr Rose.
{141695}{141745}Let's go.
{141847}{141900}Wait a minute. I forgot something.
{141917}{141967}What?
{141970}{142017}- Barbara.|- No!
{142020}{142102}- Mr Rose! Mr Rose!
{142120}{142167}Oh, no!
{142232}{142312}Oh, mein Gott. Mrs Rose!
{142717}{142767}-
{142770}{142837}-
{142840}{143087} Only you
{143152}{143202} Can
{143502}{143555} Can
{143627}{143685}What fresh hell is this?
{143815}{143865} Only
{143942}{143992} you
{144080}{144127} Can
{144525}{144572}Hi.
{144635}{144690}I brought you a surprise.
{145767}{145857} Nah-nah na nah-nah na
{145912}{145957}You are a jerk.
{146127}{146177}I'll tell you what.
{146212}{146272}You say it's mine...
{146275}{146347}..and you can have everything in this house.
{146385}{146432}OK.
{146435}{146480}It's mine.
{147242}{147297}- Barbara.
{147375}{147467}Barbara! Barbara, I'm sorry.|Are you all right? You OK?
{147470}{147500}You OK?
{148565}{148620}Well, well, well!
{148705}{148800}I'd be glad to help you...|in exchange for the house.
{148827}{148865}No.
{148865}{148960}Please don't break|the terrazzo floor when you land.
{149155}{149212}Oh! That's better.
{149360}{149442}I'm gonna save you whether you like it or not.
{149445}{149500}That won't work.
{149517}{149577}It's too heavy. It'll pull you off.
{149585}{149642}It'll work.
{149670}{149720}-
{150060}{150095}Oliver!
{150505}{150552}Almost.
{150590}{150650}All right. All right.
{150685}{150757}I think I can swing this over to the balcony.
{150760}{150812}- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!|- What?
{150867}{150960}I loosened the bolt.|I was gonna drop it on you.
{150962}{151022}Ooh! Ooh, that's a good one.
{151190}{151242}Gavin! Gavin!
{151272}{151362}- Gavin...|- Uh, Susan, let me stop the car first!
{151365}{151445}Thank God you're here!|I thought you'd never arrive.
{151445}{151505}They're in there. They're over the edge!
{151545}{151667}I guess at this point, there's no|reason to be anything but absolutely honest.
{151697}{151802}Through all that's happened...|I always loved you.
{151870}{151920}I know.
{151977}{152045}And through all this,...
{152047}{152107}..you loved me too, didn't you?
{152195}{152252}-
{152310}{152365}Get that, would you, Oliver?
{152427}{152507}- No?|- No, no. OK, we go in.
{152595}{152632}Oh, mein Gott.
{152652}{152720}Oliver! Barbara!
{152720}{152760}- Gavin!|- Gavin!
{152767}{152847}- Gavin, get a ladder!|- OK!
{152947}{153005}I knew everything would be all right.
{153135}{153180}-
{153205}{153242}Gavin!
{153302}{153375}- Gavin!|- Gavin!
{153450}{153505}-
{153555}{153635}We're gonna be all right.|you see those two wires?
{153637}{153667}Yeah.
{153672}{153777}Each of them can hold... at least 200 pounds.
{154760}{154820}-
{155545}{155597}We're coming!
{157090}{157162}Mein Gott. They are dead.
{157200}{157250}-
{157675}{157722}Some story, huh?
{157842}{157907}What's the moral?
{157910}{158010}Other than dog people should marry|dog people and cat people, cat people.
{158070}{158137}I don't know.
{158140}{158200}It could be just this:
{158202}{158300}..a civilised divorce|is a contradiction in terms.
{158347}{158430}Maybe because of what happened,|I've become too traditional.
{158432}{158527}Maybe it's not natural|to stay married to one person for life.
{158545}{158597}My parents did it.
{158600}{158650}63 years.
{158665}{158730}A few of 'em good!
{158815}{158875}So, look. Here it is.
{158877}{158942}We can begin.
{158945}{158995}When it comes to your wife,...
{158997}{159130}..I'm going to urge you to be generous|to the point of night sweats.
{159152}{159285}The all-important thing is to get you through|this as quickly and cleanly as possible...
{159287}{159365}..so that you can begin rebuilding your life.
{159365}{159415}OK?
{159477}{159527}Or...
{159590}{159642}..you can get up...
{159645}{159700}..and go home,...
{159702}{159802}..and try to find some shred...
{159805}{159907}..of what you once loved|about the sweetheart of your youth.
{160037}{160087}It's your life.
{160157}{160212}Take a minute.
{161080}{161170}Hi, what are you doing?|I'm coming home. Love you. Bye.
