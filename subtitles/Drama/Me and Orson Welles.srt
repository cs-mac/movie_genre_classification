1
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,278
By the year of 1592...

2
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:37,783
...Shakespeare was already an actor
and a playwright.

3
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:42,084
Records of how his stage career began
have not survived.

4
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:47,457
We do know that in 1594,
he joined a theatre troupe...

5
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,655
...called...?

6
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,192
Anyone remember?

7
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:55,765
Not everyone at once, now.

8
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:59,706
The Lord Chamberlain's Men.

9
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:19,151
Thank you.

10
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:20,818
Peanut, peanut, peanut.

11
00:02:20,996 --> 00:02:22,020
Peanut. Peanut.

12
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:23,687
Extra, extra! Read all about it!

13
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:26,960
Japanese tanks in Shanghai!

14
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:28,861
Here you go.

15
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,117
Swell tune.

16
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:18,116
You play it with real feeling.

17
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:20,881
God, it's so sad, isn't it?

18
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,384
- You could pick up the tempo a little bit.
- No.

19
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,586
I mean Gershwin being dead and all.

20
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:32,323
They don't like me sitting here
and not buying anything.

21
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:39,170
I really like this song.

22
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:41,341
Richard Rodgers.

23
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,343
Only guy on earth
who can write a melody like that.

24
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:46,174
They're like lullabies, aren't they?

25
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:49,681
And he knocks them out in 10 minutes.
I heard him on John Gassner.

26
00:03:49,852 --> 00:03:50,876
You listen to that?

27
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:56,586
Wow, sometimes I think I'm the only person
in New York that listens to that show.

28
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,625
Can you imagine just sitting down...

29
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:03,458
...and coming up with the melody
to "Small Hotel"?

30
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,258
I'd give my blood...

31
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:10,497
...to write anything as beautiful
as the first five notes to "Small Hotel."

32
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,497
Yeah.

33
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:16,911
So, what do you write?

34
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:18,336
What's your name?

35
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:19,538
- Gretta.
- Gretta.

36
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:22,616
I haven't written
anything very significant yet.

37
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:25,345
Actually, I'm trying to write a play.

38
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:26,613
- A play?
- Uh-huh.

39
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:28,689
That's keen,
because I'm sort of an actor.

40
00:04:28,857 --> 00:04:31,451
Really? What have you done?

41
00:04:31,627 --> 00:04:34,027
- Well, mostly shows at school.
- Oh.

42
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:35,254
Yeah.

43
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,296
So you're a real writer?

44
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:42,528
Well, I wish I could convince
<i>The New Yorker</i> of that.

45
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:45,037
And then my parents.

46
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:47,107
And then myself.

47
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:52,304
Actually, I'd skip myself and my parents
if I could just convince <i>The New Yorker.</i>

48
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:56,413
I had this creative writing teacher.

49
00:04:56,585 --> 00:05:00,146
Everything I turned in,
he'd say, "Possibilities."

50
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:03,120
Ha, ha. Oh, no.

51
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:09,392
What I want is for one person on this earth
to read something I wrote...

52
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:12,659
...and say, "You're terrific."

53
00:05:13,035 --> 00:05:14,593
You're terrific.

54
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,399
Swell. I gotta go. Um....

55
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:21,134
- Richard.
- Richard.

56
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:27,209
Wouldn't this make a great scene
for a story?

57
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:30,249
Just two people meeting like this.

58
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,148
Nothing more.

59
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:34,912
What do you think?

60
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:38,156
Possibilities.

61
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:42,324
All right, I'll see you around.

62
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,429
See you later.

63
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:51,735
Okay, we're ready.

64
00:05:51,907 --> 00:05:55,035
Let's turn it on!

65
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:57,641
Come on.

66
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,772
I know.

67
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:03,677
I've just come in off the train.

68
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:05,878
Let's go.

69
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:08,045
Will somebody go find Orson?

70
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:11,351
Tell him there's a dozen
young, well-toned ballerinas out here.

71
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,392
That will get him out.

72
00:06:15,397 --> 00:06:17,024
Wait, wait.

73
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:28,870
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

74
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:31,774
This is all the lads coming to you live...

75
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:36,111
...from the derelict theater
on West 41st Street.

76
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:39,083
- Yowza!
- Whoo!

77
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:43,187
Notice there's no date for the opening.

78
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:46,020
At least we open in November.

79
00:06:46,495 --> 00:06:49,828
Is this the best drum roll
the Mercury Theater can come up with?

80
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:51,829
Hey, I can do it.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,024
What?

82
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:54,533
I can play a drum roll.

83
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,368
Oh, yeah? Who are you?

84
00:06:58,006 --> 00:06:59,769
Gene Krupa. And you?

85
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:03,437
Truly, my name is Cinna.

86
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:06,206
I am Cinna the Poet.

87
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,042
- Where do you dwell?
- By the capital.

88
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:11,209
- Whither you going?
- I am going to Caesar's funeral.

89
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:12,944
His name's Cinna.

90
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:17,419
I'm ready to plug it in.

91
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:20,027
No, wait. Wait for Orson.

92
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,591
Peel the Big Apple, kid.

93
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:26,529
Goddamn sons of bitches,
what the hell is it now?

94
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:29,034
Is every single person in this company
against me?

95
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:32,970
Is this a goddamn conspiracy
to wreck my show?

96
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,901
This is completely inadequate.

97
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:38,512
Very possibly the worst looking thing
I've ever seen.

98
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,944
We've just had 50,000 of them printed.

99
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:43,346
They're not entirely bad.

100
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,747
Can you play the ukulele?

101
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:50,423
Mr. Welles,
you'd be hard pressed to find someone...

102
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:53,083
...who could play the ukulele
better than me.

103
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:55,287
Kid's got balls.
Will you work for nothing?

104
00:07:55,464 --> 00:07:58,024
- Orson.
- Quiet. I'm negotiating.

105
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,336
Have you ever heard anybody so in love
with the sound of his own voice...

106
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:10,202
It's the drawing-room
school of Shakespeare. Makes my blood boil.

107
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:16,181
It has nothing to do with the violence,
passion, blood of the Elizabethan stage.

108
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:18,146
Did you hear my <i>Hamlet</i> on radio?

109
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:20,521
Yes. On the Columbia Workshop last fall.

110
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,020
What did you think?

111
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:25,622
Considering the time constraints
you were under...

112
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:28,558
...trying to squeeze <i>Hamlet</i>
into two half-hour broadcasts...

113
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,698
...I'd say very close to brilliant.

114
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:32,731
That is exactly correct.

115
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:35,768
People criticized me
for cutting "To be or not to be."

116
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:37,963
But dramatically, in terms of pure story...

117
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,540
...that is the most expendable speech
in the play.

118
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,439
It doesn't tell us one thing
we don't already know.

119
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:44,772
- Can you sing?
- I'm ready.

120
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:46,471
Hold on a minute.

121
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:49,617
All right, Mr. Gielgud,
sing me something.

122
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:51,753
Astonish me.

123
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:01,287
<i>Have you</i>

124
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:03,863
<i>Tried Wheaties?</i>

125
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:05,397
MEN LAUGHING:

126
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,933
<i>They're whole wheat with all of the bran</i>

127
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:11,834
<i>Have you tried Wheaties?</i>

128
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:15,636
<i>For wheat is the best food of man</i>
<i>They're crunchy--</i>

129
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:17,369
- You're hired.
- Yay!

130
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:20,145
Okay, Sam, plug it in.

131
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:27,652
ALL CHEERING:

132
00:09:27,823 --> 00:09:29,586
AMBULANCE SIREN WAILS:

133
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,956
I've got steaks for Mr. Welles.

134
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:35,358
I'm absolutely starving to death.

135
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:38,527
See if you can keep this warm.

136
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,191
Vakhtangov, my pineapple juice.

137
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,032
Rehearsal at 6:30, people,
and we're gonna need everybody.

138
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:47,505
John, this kid is gonna play Lucius.
The other son of a bitch is fired.

139
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:50,338
Orson, we positively have
to commit to an opening date.

140
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:52,173
Thursday, I told you.

141
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:54,110
We let Tallulah open on Wednesday...

142
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:57,740
...in her $3 million Hindenburg
of <i>Antony and Cleopatra.</i>

143
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,318
Then we open Thursday.

144
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:01,956
A lean, brutal <i>Caesar.</i>

145
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:04,183
Sonja, teach the kid the part.

146
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:07,590
Know it by the time I come back, junior,
or you're fired.

147
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:11,629
I'm Sonja. Sonja spelled with a J
but pronounced like a Y.

148
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,789
Sonja Jones.

149
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:13,957
PHONE RINGING:

150
00:10:14,136 --> 00:10:15,660
<i>Have you met Miss Jones?</i>

151
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:18,738
You're probably the hundredth person
who's sung me that.

152
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:21,235
Mercury.

153
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,105
This is she.

154
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:24,777
Oh, Mr. Ingram.

155
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:26,413
Orson left just two minutes ago.

156
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:29,345
He took an ambulance to beat the traffic.

157
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:31,743
Well, according to Orson...

158
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,720
...there's no law in the books that says
you have to be sick to take an ambulance.

159
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:37,722
Of course, that's according to Orson...

160
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:42,330
...which probably means it isn't really true,
but it ought to be.

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,937
Well, this week we have the opening,
so it will be hard, but let's talk next week.

162
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:53,406
Splendid. Thank you.

163
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:54,974
Bye.

164
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:56,801
PHONE RINGING:

165
00:10:56,978 --> 00:10:58,002
Get that, Richard.

166
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,808
Everybody's gotta answer the phone
around here.

167
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:04,876
Mercury.

168
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:06,680
<i>Brooks Atkinson from</i> The Times...

169
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:09,050
<i>...verifying a Thursday evening</i>
<i>opening for</i> Caesar.

170
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:10,316
One minute, sir.

171
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:11,818
Brooks Atkinson.

172
00:11:15,564 --> 00:11:21,230
Mr. A, it's Sonja. I got the roses.
They're absolutely beautiful.

173
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:24,566
I've never seen that shade of yellow
before.

174
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:28,674
Yeah. No, I'm so sorry
we keep changing the opening on you...

175
00:11:28,844 --> 00:11:30,971
...but Thursday's firm.

176
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:34,513
That means we won't change it again
for at least another hour.

177
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:36,241
SONJA LAUGHS:

178
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:40,444
No, that's right. Yeah, modern dress.

179
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:45,321
Everybody's marching around
in fascist military uniforms. It's brilliant.

180
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:48,327
Orson's really outdone himself here.

181
00:11:48,697 --> 00:11:52,326
Okay, and thank you again so much
for the roses.

182
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,560
Atkinson sends you flowers?

183
00:11:58,006 --> 00:12:00,133
I did him a very small favor.

184
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:04,472
Listen, let's take a run-out powder
before the phone starts ringing again.

185
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:07,514
Here you go, Gielgud.

186
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:09,081
SONJA SIGHS:

187
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:12,152
A Vassar education
and this is what I'm doing.

188
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,051
If my parents ever found out, they'd ship
me back on the next train to Ohio.

189
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:18,784
I didn't know Ohio actually existed.

190
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,721
I wish there were no rehearsal tonight.

191
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,561
Barbirolli is conducting the <i>Pathetique</i>
at Carnegie.

192
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:28,328
Don't you absolutely love Tchaikovsky?

193
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:29,765
Adore him.

194
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:34,272
This guy from Jed Harris' office
begged for me to go with him.

195
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:39,111
So, instead, I'm filling out little 11's...

196
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:42,275
...with a ukulele player, no less.

197
00:12:44,186 --> 00:12:46,654
"Mr. Welles,
you'd be hard pressed to find a better--"

198
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:50,052
And how did you end up
at the Mercury Theater...

199
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:53,285
...Miss "Sonja with a J,
but pronounced like a Y"?

200
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,429
By completely telling the truth?

201
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:00,763
John Houseman once told me
that this whole business is based on BS...

202
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:03,996
...and the more I work here,
the more I think he's right.

203
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,069
You probably can't even spell ukulele.

204
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:09,535
Y-O-U-C-A--

205
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:10,769
It ain't funny, McGee.

206
00:13:10,946 --> 00:13:11,970
No, seriously...

207
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:15,412
...why would anybody even play a ukulele
in <i>Julius Caesar</i> anyway?

208
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,916
They've got it disguised as a lute.

209
00:13:18,086 --> 00:13:19,246
Lucius, that's you...

210
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:22,117
...sings Brutus a lullaby
right before the final battle.

211
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,222
I'm singing on-stage?

212
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:26,755
Yeah.

213
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:28,623
Who plays Brutus?

214
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:30,321
Orson.

215
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:34,759
Who was playing Lucius
before I showed up?

216
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:37,127
Some kid.

217
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:39,637
He had a personality problem with Orson.

218
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:40,900
Meaning?

219
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:44,705
Meaning he had a personality.

220
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,579
Listen, Orson is very competitive,
very self-centered...

221
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:53,152
...very brilliant.

222
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:54,481
He's read everything.

223
00:13:54,656 --> 00:13:56,988
He knows everything.

224
00:13:57,359 --> 00:14:00,157
And the rule with Orson is
you don't criticize him.

225
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,352
Ever.

226
00:14:02,464 --> 00:14:05,831
So, in the name of his talent,
and the hopes of working with him again...

227
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:07,992
...you forgive a lot of behavior.

228
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:13,637
So you're doing all this for no money?

229
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:17,539
It's not about the money.
I want something bigger.

230
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:21,176
I have this girlfriend who works
for Harold Ross at <i>The New Yorker...</i>

231
00:14:21,349 --> 00:14:23,579
...the high and mighty <i>New Yorker...</i>

232
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:26,949
...and she tells me, even there,
it's all about running for coffee...

233
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:30,683
...and laughing
at his stupid, vulgar jokes.

234
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:34,057
If the Mercury Theater closes
on Thursday night...

235
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:37,255
...and it very well might...

236
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:40,697
...I know 20 people
who could get me a job.

237
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:44,535
Do you know who John promised
to introduce me to?

238
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:46,139
Who?

239
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,572
David O. Selznick.

240
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:50,074
This is not bunk.

241
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:52,679
David O. Selznick.

242
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:56,442
The man who's preparing to film
<i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

243
00:14:56,618 --> 00:14:58,882
Does this mean you won't marry me?

244
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:01,480
I don't know, late.

245
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:03,453
Late, I think.

246
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,928
Ma, here comes the librarian. I gotta go.

247
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,462
Oh, save some spaghetti for me.

248
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:12,761
I love you too.

249
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:14,667
Bye.

250
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,174
Okay, you've got two real scenes.

251
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,113
Both short.

252
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:36,185
Brutus, Orson,
is talking with Portia, Muriel Brassler...

253
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:37,825
...a bitch of the first water...

254
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:41,621
...but nobody can say anything
because Orson's having an affair with her.

255
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,931
- Orson's married, you know.
- Ah.

256
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,534
Absolutely. "Ah."

257
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:49,932
Little Virginia.

258
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:51,936
She's very pretty.

259
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:54,371
She's very pregnant.

260
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:58,811
They've got this tiny
little basement apartment in the village...

261
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,313
...but he keeps her locked away
across the river at Sneden's Landing.

262
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:06,053
And if you ever hear anybody yell
"Anna Stafford"...

263
00:16:06,221 --> 00:16:08,086
...it's code for "Virginia."

264
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:10,087
It means she's shown up unexpectedly...

265
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:13,125
...and Orson better hide the ballerina
he's trying to seduce.

266
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:16,058
Well, the Mercury
is sounding more interesting all the time.

267
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:19,826
By the way, if anybody asks,
you're an Equity junior member.

268
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:23,801
- And you're getting $25 a week.
- Swell.

269
00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:27,237
No, you're not getting $25 a week.

270
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:28,967
You're not getting anything...

271
00:16:29,377 --> 00:16:33,279
...except the opportunity
to be sprayed by Orson's spit.

272
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,074
STRUMMING UKULELE:

273
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:46,617
Please stop.

274
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:50,256
Aren't we supposed
to be doing something?

275
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:52,866
Oh, kid, you'll soon realize...

276
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:58,233
...the principal occupation
of the Mercury Theater is waiting for Orson.

277
00:16:58,406 --> 00:16:59,930
Right?

278
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:01,740
Hey.

279
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,370
DRUMMING RHYTHMICALLY:

280
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:11,208
Hey, Norman, could you verify
that your bio is correct?

281
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:12,683
And initial it if it's okay.

282
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:14,185
Anything for you, doll.

283
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:16,550
And Richard, thanks for dinner tonight.

284
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,791
You had dinner with the Ice Queen?

285
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:28,559
Kid, every guy in this show
is trying to get into her pants.

286
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:30,260
Even Joe Cotten hasn't...

287
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:34,204
...and there's not a broad in
the Manhattan phone book he hasn't nailed.

288
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:37,201
It's not as simple as that.
This isn't the Federal.

289
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:39,209
I'm the front office.

290
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,577
You're starting to talk like a real bureaucrat,
Jacko.

291
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,184
A small-minded,
little copies-in-triplicate...

292
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:48,220
...and please-God-
don't-disturb-my-lunch-hour bureaucrat.

293
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:50,949
I left the Federal
to escape people like you.

294
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,320
And you telling
John Mason Brown and the <i>Post...</i>

295
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:56,362
...that the opening date is still tentative
is irresponsible--

296
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:58,658
- And accurate.
- We have subscribers.

297
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,495
We're trying to sell tickets.
You can't just say--

298
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:03,528
The play opens when it's ready.

299
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:07,869
Orson, this play opens on Thursday
or we are dead as a theatrical company.

300
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:11,205
I can not rehearse
with this man in the theater.

301
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:18,409
This is an infinitely rewarding partnership,
Orson.

302
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:22,850
You go around smashing everything.
You disenfranchise every friend...

303
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,286
...every supporter we have.

304
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:27,622
And then I am left desperately
trying to clean up your mess.

305
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:30,355
Because I am the one
who ends up making the apologies...

306
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:34,059
...making the corrections,
and making the 10,000 phone calls.

307
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,760
And I'm out acting in <i>The Shadow,</i>
<i>The March of Time</i>...

308
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:39,668
...and every other piece of shit radio show
in this city...

309
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:43,208
...just to pour my money
into this son of a bitch theater...

310
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:46,836
- ...that you're supposed to be running!
- That I'm supposed to be running?

311
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:49,279
I am killing myself trying to run it!

312
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,910
Did you see those dinosaurs
on the cover of <i>TIME?</i>

313
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:54,213
Look at this.

314
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:57,217
The son of a bitch Lunts.

315
00:18:57,392 --> 00:18:58,381
ALL CHUCKLE:

316
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,586
Let me tell you something.
Before this year is over, I--

317
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:03,958
We will be on the cover of <i>TIME.</i>

318
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:07,397
This stage is where theatrical history
is being written.

319
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:11,164
With you and me
and all of us as its principal players.

320
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:12,567
Orson.

321
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,840
Exhausted as I am...

322
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,141
...I will attempt to rise above the arrogance
and jealousy around me...

323
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:22,613
...and get you your opening.

324
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:25,082
The small-mindedness around here.
I'm suffocating.

325
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:26,413
Thursday.

326
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:29,282
Let it be said...

327
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:35,054
...that here was a man
who loved the Mercury not wisely...

328
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:37,094
...but too well.

329
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:38,425
Anna Stafford.

330
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,794
Oh, Christ.

331
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:43,495
You see, Betty, I believe it was Stanislavsky
who said to Max Reinhardt--

332
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:48,135
- Ginny, what a delightful surprise.
- Orson.

333
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:50,106
How are you, my angel?

334
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:51,438
- How is baby?
- Orson.

335
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:53,843
- Let me take this for you.
- Thank you, just--

336
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,074
It's good to see you.

337
00:19:57,251 --> 00:20:00,118
- I'll be back this evening.
- Thanks, fellas.

338
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:05,724
Mr. Welles, what I had to do
to get 27 gallons of red paint.

339
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:07,724
I wanna talk to you
about the playbill.

340
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,886
The choice of words,
there's a mistake here.

341
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:11,292
I've corrected it already.

342
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:14,902
- It doesn't represent my contribution.
- You're looking at the proof.

343
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,696
It's all been corrected. See Sonja.

344
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:19,965
Coulouris.
Vakhtangov, my pineapple juice.

345
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:23,304
Forum scene. Gather we our forces.

346
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:25,969
Coulouris, front and center.

347
00:20:27,348 --> 00:20:29,475
Where is that gloomy bastard?

348
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:31,075
- Vakhtangov.
- Sir?

349
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:34,016
Find Coulouris, tell him
to get his no-acting ass down here.

350
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:36,053
Jesus Christ, who's directing this show?

351
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:38,089
LLOYD WHISPERS::
That's what I'd like to know.

352
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:40,853
One more comment like that, Mr. Lloyd...

353
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:44,396
...and your precious Cinna the Poet scene
hits the cutting-room floor.

354
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:50,066
Are we ever gonna actually rehearse
my precious Cinna the Poet scene, Orson?

355
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:51,262
Rehearse?

356
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:54,101
I thought
you were the great comic improviser, Lloyd.

357
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:56,243
The Chaplin of the Federal.

358
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:57,742
ALL CHUCKLE:

359
00:20:57,912 --> 00:21:02,076
Mr. Coulouris. You look swell.

360
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,741
ALL LAUGHING:

361
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,825
I thought this was a dress rehearsal.

362
00:21:13,227 --> 00:21:14,694
The way you cut the text...

363
00:21:14,862 --> 00:21:17,126
...my character
might as well not be in the play.

364
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:18,356
Please.

365
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:22,060
Antony's funeral oration
is the dramatic centerpiece of <i>Caesar.</i>

366
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:24,067
Every schoolboy in the world knows it.

367
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:27,230
People in the audience
will be whispering it with you.

368
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:29,774
Yes, yes. If they're still awake...

369
00:21:29,944 --> 00:21:32,606
...after those endless scenes
between you and Gabel.

370
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,011
Why every Cassius scene
should be labored over...

371
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:38,675
...every precious,
tedious exchange preserved...

372
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:40,480
...while the part of Mark Antony...

373
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:44,250
...a character universally acknowledged
to be the pivotal role in the play...

374
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:47,792
...should be shorn down to 40 lines
is something I will never understand.

375
00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:51,261
But, Gabel's the director's darling
in this piece.

376
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:54,230
Just as Olivier was
when we performed together...

377
00:21:54,402 --> 00:21:57,269
...at Elsie Fogerty's Central School
of Speech and Drama.

378
00:21:57,438 --> 00:21:58,837
George.

379
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:02,806
Now, what's crucial
to "Friends, Romans, countrymen..."

380
00:22:02,977 --> 00:22:06,276
...is not so much the speech itself,
but its effect on your audience.

381
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:08,142
Listen.

382
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:09,977
You judge their reactions.

383
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:12,915
- You pause. You tune them to your ends.
- Orson.

384
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:16,750
Do you imagine
you're telling me something I don't know?

385
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:17,982
MAN SCREAMS:

386
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,649
Duthie.

387
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:24,259
- Hey down there.
- All right?

388
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:25,694
You need a hand up?

389
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:28,927
First you cut my part to shreds,
now you're trying to kill us all.

390
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:32,504
I've never been associated
with such a ragtag production.

391
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:34,106
Modern dress.

392
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,936
You can't afford costumes.

393
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,136
You can't even afford a stage
that isn't gaping with holes.

394
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:42,111
Stage traps are a tradition
as old as Shakespeare.

395
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,348
Hey, no kids in this scene.
It's a vicious mob.

396
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,045
I thought you were out somewhere,
learning your lines.

397
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:49,553
Oh, I know my lines.

398
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:52,991
Go to the gate, somebody knocks.

399
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:55,485
Sir, it is your brother, Cassius.

400
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:58,291
- Is he alone?
- No, sir, there are more with him.

401
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:01,128
Not "more with him."
"Moe with him," the plural.

402
00:23:01,302 --> 00:23:03,497
This is Shakespearean verse
we're speaking.

403
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:06,401
Think you can change the words
of the greatest playwright...

404
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:08,565
...because you're not comfortable
with them?

405
00:23:08,743 --> 00:23:11,541
- No, I meant moe--
- Go home and learn your lines.

406
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:13,236
I know my lines.

407
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:16,249
And I say you need moe time.

408
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:17,441
MEN CHUCKLE:

409
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:18,846
Remember, junior...

410
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,356
...this tiny scene serves to humanize
the entire historical pageant of the play.

411
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:27,585
We cry for the death of Brutus
because of this one scene.

412
00:23:27,762 --> 00:23:32,165
And that beautiful lullaby
captures all his inexpressible sadness.

413
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:36,895
A lullaby I interpolated, by the way,
from <i>Henry VIII,</i> act three, scene one.

414
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,067
Have we given him the ukulele yet?

415
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,334
Sonja. He needs the music for the song.

416
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:55,014
- Your mother is very unhappy with you.
- For what?

417
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:57,783
Well, for coming in after midnight,
that's what.

418
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:04,557
"Jeez, the small-mindedness around here.

419
00:24:04,932 --> 00:24:07,366
I'm suffocating."

420
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:29,284
But when he once attains
the upmost round--

421
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:33,120
Orson, I never heard of lights
with no color in them.

422
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:35,455
- Hey, Richard.
- Where are the gels?

423
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,088
- Hi.
- Let's worry about the gels later.

424
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:41,101
Barrymore Pink...

425
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:47,208
...is the only color that effectively highlights
the natural tonalities of my skin.

426
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,935
Jeannie, would you be a dear
and put this in, please?

427
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:51,442
Do whatever she says.

428
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:53,876
I just don't wanna hear any more
about tonalities.

429
00:24:54,048 --> 00:24:55,481
- Okay, Orson.
- All right?

430
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,279
Now, I've been playing my soliloquy
down stage right.

431
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:03,287
But 'tis a common proof
That lowliness is young--

432
00:25:03,457 --> 00:25:05,391
Is that where you're gonna be standing?

433
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,322
Would you like to redirect the play?

434
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:10,794
Maybe we could bathe the entire audience
in Barrymore Pink.

435
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:14,025
I am worried that I'm gonna look
like some giant hovering over you.

436
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:16,635
- People are gonna laugh.
- Nobody is gonna laugh.

437
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:19,705
- Nobody is even gonna be looking at you.
- There. You see.

438
00:25:19,874 --> 00:25:23,173
Nobody is gonna be looking at you
because they'll be listening to you.

439
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:25,972
Transported by the poetry.

440
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:28,911
That's the magic of this play,
not the goddamn tonalities.

441
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,415
I want,
and I don't think I'm being unreasonable...

442
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,679
...is for you to take one step up here
before I enter.

443
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:40,092
Thank you.

444
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:41,990
Anything you say, Muriel.

445
00:25:42,163 --> 00:25:44,529
Can you aim that spot directly down,
dear?

446
00:25:44,699 --> 00:25:46,564
When the light hits my face correctly...

447
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:49,294
...a tiny butterfly-shaped shadow
appears under my nose.

448
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,166
That's when you know you've got it right.
Okay, let's go.

449
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,002
Will you be patient?

450
00:25:55,943 --> 00:25:57,911
Will you stay awhile?

451
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,810
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
I fear I wrong the honorable men

452
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:04,645
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar;
I do fear it.

453
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:06,252
- Honorable men.
- Murderers.

454
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,479
I got together with Jeanette Bradley.

455
00:26:08,656 --> 00:26:11,147
She dicked me over
by sleeping with Orson again.

456
00:26:11,325 --> 00:26:13,850
But that same night,
I met up with Velma Lord...

457
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:16,258
...and then later, Muriel Brassler.

458
00:26:16,864 --> 00:26:19,355
What's the dope on Muriel?
I heard she's a gymnast.

459
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:22,331
Yeah, she's got a gymnast's body,
I'll tell you that.

460
00:26:22,503 --> 00:26:25,404
Did she get a firm grip
on your monkey bar?

461
00:26:25,573 --> 00:26:27,871
Hey, what's with Evelyn?

462
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:30,101
I think she's got style.

463
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:31,904
- <i>I like her style</i>
<i>- I like her smile</i>

464
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,106
<i>- I like her class</i>
<i>- I like her other features</i>

465
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:41,582
Now, here's a cute little lass.

466
00:26:41,756 --> 00:26:43,246
Oh, I like her face too.

467
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:44,516
Hi, Richard.

468
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:47,354
How's my favorite Equity junior member?

469
00:26:47,528 --> 00:26:48,893
Fine.

470
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:51,190
Is that a new blouse?

471
00:26:51,365 --> 00:26:53,595
Actually, it is new.
Thank you for noticing.

472
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:55,793
And you're still reading
my favorite novel?

473
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,565
I'm annotating it, so when I meet Selznick
we'll have something to talk about.

474
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,469
When are you meeting Selznick?

475
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:03,837
John's trying to get him here
for opening night.

476
00:27:04,011 --> 00:27:05,603
Are you kidding?

477
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,943
I'm going on
in a completely unrehearsed scene...

478
00:27:09,116 --> 00:27:11,243
...and David O. Selznick
is gonna be here?

479
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:12,443
Oh, sweet Jasper...

480
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,249
...I'll end my Broadway career
and my Hollywood career at the same time.

481
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:18,255
Thrift, thrift.

482
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:20,917
Be quite a coup
if you could actually meet him.

483
00:27:21,095 --> 00:27:22,562
Oh, I'll meet him.

484
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,924
You know, Sonja...

485
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:27,659
...I discovered this exquisite little place
in the village.

486
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:31,632
Would you let me take you there tonight?
After rehearsal?

487
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:33,171
It's open late.

488
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,774
Well, that's a wonderfully generous offer,
Joe...

489
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:39,743
...but I've already got a date
with Richard.

490
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:48,018
She's kidding. She's kidding.

491
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:50,089
Welcome to quadruple space, kid.

492
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:51,690
What's quadruple space?

493
00:27:52,093 --> 00:27:55,756
You know, in a novel, when the
main characters are finally about to shtup.

494
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:58,861
They can't describe it,
otherwise they can't print the book.

495
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:02,264
They just go, you know, "he hugged
her hard, they fell on to the bed."

496
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:03,835
Period.

497
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:05,929
Quadruple space.

498
00:28:06,107 --> 00:28:09,338
Yeah, yeah,
and the next paragraph it's like...

499
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:14,743
...the sun is rising and the milkman
is knocking the bottles together.

500
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:17,008
The good stuff happens
in the quadruple space.

501
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:20,449
Fertilizer's hoping to make his next 30 years
one long quadruple space.

502
00:28:20,621 --> 00:28:23,351
- Forty.
- Have you ever with, uh...?

503
00:28:23,524 --> 00:28:25,719
No, goddamn it. I've tried.

504
00:28:25,893 --> 00:28:27,360
No quadruple space?

505
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:30,554
Dinner, dancing. I must have spent
30 bucks on that broad.

506
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:31,755
A bet.

507
00:28:31,932 --> 00:28:35,800
Two bucks for the first guy
who gets into Sonja's pants.

508
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,301
That's unspeakably crude.

509
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:38,563
Yeah, it's cheap.

510
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:40,570
And demeaning.

511
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:43,867
Okay, five bucks.

512
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:46,176
- Deal.
- Deal.

513
00:28:46,614 --> 00:28:49,105
- We'll all of us be there to fetch him.
- Break a leg.

514
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:51,478
Yeah. With this ladder, I probably will.

515
00:28:51,652 --> 00:28:54,849
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

516
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,853
Faster.

517
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:00,994
A sick man would speak with you.

518
00:29:01,162 --> 00:29:02,186
Louder.

519
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:06,197
- A sick man would speak with you.
- That's good, now exit left.

520
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:08,562
Stage left.

521
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,169
MEN CHUCKLE:

522
00:29:10,337 --> 00:29:12,532
Caius Ligarius.

523
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:16,403
I am not sick,
if Brutus have in hand any exploit....

524
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:20,013
- How'd I do?
- I cried.

525
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:23,310
Friends. Friends.

526
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:26,146
Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;

527
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,015
Let us hear what Antony can say.

528
00:29:28,522 --> 00:29:31,252
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

529
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:34,622
The evil that men do lives after them;

530
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:38,292
The good is oft interred with their bones,
so let it be with Caesar.

531
00:29:38,465 --> 00:29:39,454
SONJA SNEEZES:

532
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:41,100
The noble Brutus.

533
00:29:41,268 --> 00:29:43,099
I've got the Mercury cold.

534
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:45,066
Don't get too close to me.

535
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,969
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.

536
00:29:51,812 --> 00:29:53,040
Look at this.

537
00:30:05,326 --> 00:30:06,725
Yowza.

538
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:10,295
This is one of those letters
that change your life, Richard.

539
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:13,524
Three sentences,
and your entire future is altered.

540
00:30:13,701 --> 00:30:16,101
And Brutus is an honorable man.

541
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,797
When he hath brought
many captives home to Rome

542
00:30:19,974 --> 00:30:23,808
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill;
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

543
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:26,838
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

544
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:29,676
So, what's it like
to be a beautiful woman?

545
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:34,011
It must be interesting
having the whole world fall at your feet.

546
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:36,122
Are you kidding?

547
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,281
I hate the way I look.

548
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:40,620
I'm one huge catalogue of faults.

549
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:44,595
Name me one fault.

550
00:30:49,136 --> 00:30:51,127
My left breast is smaller than my right.

551
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:57,435
Have you got a ruler?

552
00:30:58,078 --> 00:30:59,875
SONJA LAUGHS:

553
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:06,247
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?

554
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,048
- Ay, my lord, an't please you.
- Slower.

555
00:31:09,223 --> 00:31:11,191
It does, my boy:

556
00:31:11,358 --> 00:31:15,385
I trouble thee too much,
but thou art willing.

557
00:31:15,562 --> 00:31:17,553
It is my duty, sir.

558
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:19,892
Not there. Up a step.

559
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:26,472
I should not urge thy duty past thy might.
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

560
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,700
- I have slept, my lord, already.
- Louder. This isn't a school play.

561
00:31:29,877 --> 00:31:31,868
I have slept, my lord, already.

562
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:36,142
It was well done,
and thou shalt sleep again.

563
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:43,314
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
I will be good to thee.

564
00:31:43,757 --> 00:31:45,247
Play.

565
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:52,625
<i>Orpheus with his lute</i>

566
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,924
<i>Made trees--</i>

567
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:56,358
<i>Made trees</i>

568
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:57,765
Needs work, junior.

569
00:31:57,938 --> 00:32:00,168
When you can play it,
exit left at the blackout.

570
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:02,866
Funeral scene. Gather.

571
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:05,011
All right, here we go again.

572
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:14,781
Part two, the histories.

573
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:17,086
A period of development.

574
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:23,357
1594 to 1600.

575
00:32:24,865 --> 00:32:28,096
Please make sure the following
is in your notes, ladies and gentlemen.

576
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:31,028
Hint, hint.

577
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:47,347
Oh, hi.

578
00:32:54,595 --> 00:32:57,655
- Good afternoon, Richard.
- You're always working, huh, Sam?

579
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:01,028
That's what we have to do
if it's for the right cause.

580
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:03,032
I live by an old saying:

581
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:06,070
In the theater,
we sing the dignity of man.

582
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,265
I have a commitment to Joe Ainley.

583
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:11,411
He moved the whole radio show
to New York just for me.

584
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:13,569
Your primary commitment
is to the Mercury.

585
00:33:13,747 --> 00:33:15,715
Come on, junior.
We'll rehearse on the way.

586
00:33:15,883 --> 00:33:17,350
Orson, for the last time...

587
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:20,385
...we need every bit of your energy
directed here.

588
00:33:20,554 --> 00:33:22,021
Get in, junior.

589
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:23,213
One hour.

590
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,255
Have Ash run them through the show.

591
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:28,088
- Don't do this to me, Orson.
- This is network, John.

592
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:30,321
If the country knows
who Orson Welles is...

593
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:32,590
...that can't be bad for the Mercury,
can it?

594
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:35,997
- 485 Madison.
- Sure thing, Mr. Welles.

595
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:39,998
AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING:

596
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:46,369
Well, it's Monday
and we haven't had the bad-luck thing yet.

597
00:33:46,547 --> 00:33:48,742
- I'm a little worried.
- The bad-luck thing?

598
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:50,713
An old theatrical superstition.

599
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:54,013
You need to have the bad-luck thing
before you can open.

600
00:33:54,188 --> 00:33:57,157
If you don't, then opening night
becomes the bad-luck thing.

601
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:00,157
- You believe that?
- Oh, I've seen it.

602
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:01,919
This time it's making me afraid.

603
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:04,461
It's the one hurdle we haven't passed.

604
00:34:04,832 --> 00:34:08,632
- Duthie fell through the trapdoor.
- No. Deeper than that.

605
00:34:08,802 --> 00:34:10,861
More sinister.

606
00:34:11,038 --> 00:34:14,565
It's a malevolent spirit
that must be exorcised.

607
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:17,141
You pray it happens before the opening.

608
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:22,882
Do you know Booth Tarkington's
<i>The Magnificent Ambersons?</i>

609
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,348
Tarkington was a family friend.

610
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:29,619
The character of Eugene, the inventor,
is based on my father...

611
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,190
...who died when I was 15.

612
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,360
My mother, when I was 9.

613
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:41,859
<i>Ambersons</i> is about how everything
gets taken away from you.

614
00:34:42,936 --> 00:34:44,528
I've been adapting it for radio.

615
00:34:44,705 --> 00:34:46,798
Did you hear my <i>Les Miserables</i>
in August?

616
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:49,534
Sensational reviews...

617
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,270
...and the worst goddamn Crosleys
in radio history.

618
00:34:52,446 --> 00:34:53,572
ORSON CHUCKLES:

619
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:55,408
Listen to this.

620
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:59,018
Pure American poetry.

621
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,386
"We can't ever tell
what will happen at all, can we?

622
00:35:04,224 --> 00:35:09,025
Once I stood where we're standing now,
to say goodbye to a pretty girl.

623
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:11,289
I was wild about her.

624
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:14,161
In fact, we decided
we couldn't live without each other...

625
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:16,461
...and we were to be married.

626
00:35:16,637 --> 00:35:20,300
She had to go abroad first with her father,
and when we came to say goodbye...

627
00:35:20,474 --> 00:35:24,240
...we knew we wouldn't see each other
for almost a year.

628
00:35:24,978 --> 00:35:27,037
I thought I couldn't live through it.

629
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:29,682
And she stood here crying."

630
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,787
Come on up with me.

631
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:41,450
You can learn everything there is to know
about radio in one hour.

632
00:35:44,698 --> 00:35:47,633
I'm afraid, Mr. Welles,
we're going to have to ask your friend--

633
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:48,961
Call me Orson.

634
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:53,038
We're going to have to ask your friend
to wait out here during the recording.

635
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:55,231
Mr. Ainley is very strict.

636
00:35:55,409 --> 00:35:58,401
He's my biographer.
I've already cleared it with Joe.

637
00:35:58,579 --> 00:35:59,603
Your name is?

638
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,771
Lorelei Lathrop.

639
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:05,316
That may very well be the most
musically perfect name I've ever heard.

640
00:36:05,485 --> 00:36:07,976
Something so graceful
in the way you move too.

641
00:36:08,155 --> 00:36:10,885
- You're a dancer, aren't you?
- I studied ballet.

642
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:14,824
You've seen Jack Holland
and June Hart at the Ritz-Carlton?

643
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:16,292
No.

644
00:36:16,463 --> 00:36:19,955
My God, if you love dance,
you must see them.

645
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:23,500
Will you let me take you tonight?

646
00:36:24,705 --> 00:36:26,673
All right, places, everybody.

647
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,331
Orchestra, can you please? Thank you.

648
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:31,443
STAGE BELL RINGING:

649
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:34,137
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
let's run through it.

650
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:37,044
How are you?
Good to see you again.

651
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:39,310
Orson, we've been rehearsing
without you.

652
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:42,284
- You wanna run through your scenes first?
- Not necessary.

653
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:44,788
- Barbara.
- Good to see you.

654
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:46,425
- How are you?
- Very good.

655
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,993
- Mr. Tremayne, we meet again.
- Orson.

656
00:36:49,162 --> 00:36:50,959
Orson Welles. Good to work with you.

657
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:53,622
Hello, nice to see you again.

658
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,665
The Shadow knows.

659
00:36:55,836 --> 00:36:57,633
Good to see you.

660
00:36:58,171 --> 00:36:59,934
What are we doing?

661
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:03,640
<i>"The Late Edition For Love."</i>

662
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,214
Joe, what do you want for Van Doren?

663
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:12,910
- Gruff and abrasive, sort of front page?
- Yes, but with a little heart.

664
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:14,314
Naturally.

665
00:37:14,488 --> 00:37:17,480
- Lorelei, may I get a glass of water?
- Certainly, Mr. Tremayne.

666
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:19,751
Places, everybody.

667
00:37:20,093 --> 00:37:21,958
- Would you like a script?
- Sure.

668
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:24,029
- That's Les Tremayne?
- Uh-huh.

669
00:37:24,197 --> 00:37:27,633
Okay, orchestra, ready?

670
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,291
Good.

671
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,562
All right.

672
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:35,232
Quiet, please.

673
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:41,773
ORCHESTRA PLAYING SOFT MUSIC:

674
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:47,444
SOUNDS OF TROLLY CAR
AND TRAFFIC PLAYING ON RECORD:

675
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:49,111
FOOTSTEP NOISE:

676
00:37:50,457 --> 00:37:51,515
HONKING:

677
00:37:51,692 --> 00:37:53,592
All of Broadway
can feel the electricity tonight...

678
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,196
...as we eagerly await the opening
of what promises to be another hit...

679
00:37:57,364 --> 00:38:00,527
...at the Little Theater off Times Square.

680
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:02,891
I need more time.

681
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,470
Story of a lifetime
right in front of your nose...

682
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:07,266
...and you need more time?

683
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:08,669
It's Marjorie.

684
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:12,710
I'm spending so much time at the Eagle,
I'm afraid she's gonna leave me.

685
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:14,437
And what if she did?

686
00:38:14,614 --> 00:38:16,605
You think you'll never forget her?

687
00:38:16,783 --> 00:38:18,273
Look at us, Runyon.

688
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:21,785
Me without my story
and you without your girl.

689
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:25,247
We can't ever tell
what will happen at all, can we?

690
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:30,294
Once I stood in Grand Central Station
to say goodbye to a pretty girl.

691
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:31,658
I was wild about her.

692
00:38:32,499 --> 00:38:34,831
We decided
we couldn't live without each other...

693
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:36,366
...and we were to be married.

694
00:38:36,536 --> 00:38:40,267
She had to go abroad first with her father
and when we came to say goodbye...

695
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,534
...we knew we wouldn't see each other
for almost a year.

696
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:47,737
I thought I couldn't live through it.
And she stood there crying.

697
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:50,480
Well, I don't even know
where she lives now...

698
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,675
...or if she is living.

699
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:55,044
If she ever thinks of me at all...

700
00:38:55,222 --> 00:39:00,854
...she probably imagines I'm still dancing
in some ballroom somewhere.

701
00:39:01,027 --> 00:39:03,495
Life and money...

702
00:39:03,663 --> 00:39:07,895
...both behave like quicksilver
in a nest of cracks.

703
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:11,401
When they're gone, we can't tell where.

704
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:14,267
Or what the devil we did with them.

705
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:17,866
Well, Runyon,
you've got a tough decision to make.

706
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:21,912
And I guess it all comes down
to how much a guy will do for love.

707
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:24,642
And how much will you do, Runyon?

708
00:39:24,818 --> 00:39:27,343
Anything I have to.

709
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:31,282
ORCHESTRA PLAYS & STOPS:

710
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:33,790
What the hell was that?

711
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,825
Thought I'd improvise a little.

712
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:38,521
God, I thought you
were quoting something famous.

713
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:41,531
Orson, I don't know what it was,
but it was brilliant.

714
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:43,999
It was the best thing in the show.

715
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:46,901
You mean it was the best thing
not in the show.

716
00:39:47,073 --> 00:39:48,734
ALL LAUGH:

717
00:39:51,044 --> 00:39:53,478
Oh, let me get that for you.

718
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,517
Tell them I'm gonna be a little late.

719
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:14,162
Everyone just come forward.

720
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:17,770
And from me.

721
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:21,536
Okay.

722
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:26,037
Everybody take 20 minutes.
Hopefully he'll be back by then.

723
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:27,908
Looking good.

724
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:30,211
Looking good?

725
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:32,450
Looking good?

726
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:34,052
My prediction?

727
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:37,520
The Mercury Theater
will be out of business by Friday.

728
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:43,521
Believe me, people in 1937
will not pay $2 to see tragedy.

729
00:40:43,897 --> 00:40:48,095
My advice, fellow Mercurians?

730
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:49,858
Polish thy resume.

731
00:40:50,036 --> 00:40:51,025
KNOCKING ON DOOR:

732
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:52,831
Come in.

733
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,664
Hey.

734
00:40:54,841 --> 00:40:57,332
Hey, junior, how you doing?

735
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,535
You know, waiting for Orson.

736
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:03,444
MAN ON RADIO:: <i>Valiant defense of</i>
<i>Shanghai seems on the brink of total collapse.</i>

737
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:04,641
<i>All day yesterday...</i>

738
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:08,083
<i>...Japanese tanks rolled up and down</i>
<i>the streets of Shanghai, killing--</i>

739
00:41:08,255 --> 00:41:09,483
RADIO TURNS OFF:

740
00:41:09,656 --> 00:41:13,023
Sometimes it seems to me
as if the whole world is falling apart.

741
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:17,095
Well, at least we can reassure ourselves
that during these tumultuous times...

742
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:19,596
...we're doing something
really important.

743
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:21,097
Typing up subscription lists.

744
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:23,463
I know, it's crazy, isn't it?

745
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:27,835
Times as hard as these, and people go on
doing what they've always been doing.

746
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:29,339
You've got great eyes.

747
00:41:34,948 --> 00:41:37,178
Okay, so tell me who you are.

748
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,648
- Who I am?
- Yeah.

749
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:43,255
And don't tell me about your
high school sweetheart or your parents.

750
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,354
Tell me who you are.

751
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,988
What do you want?

752
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:50,127
That's a hard question.

753
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:53,460
Well, what do you love?

754
00:41:54,868 --> 00:41:56,631
Um....

755
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:03,869
Plays, movies, songs, lyrics.

756
00:42:05,178 --> 00:42:07,806
Novels, radio.

757
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:10,040
I don't know. A lot of different things.

758
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:11,979
You see? That's it.

759
00:42:12,152 --> 00:42:15,178
There's so much more to life
than just being an actor.

760
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:19,554
I keep wondering what you're doing
mincing around the stage.

761
00:42:19,726 --> 00:42:22,126
- Mincing?
- Oh, come on, you know what I mean.

762
00:42:22,295 --> 00:42:23,990
You know, all that ego up there.

763
00:42:24,164 --> 00:42:26,291
It's exciting.

764
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:28,757
We might have a show
that closes Thursday...

765
00:42:28,935 --> 00:42:32,564
...or we might have a show
that people will remember for 50 years.

766
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:35,207
Probably neither one of those,
but you never know.

767
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,842
That's what's so exciting.

768
00:42:38,244 --> 00:42:39,768
You're cute.

769
00:42:39,946 --> 00:42:42,176
You romanticize everything.

770
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:49,182
So, what are we doing later?

771
00:42:50,924 --> 00:42:54,018
Well, I'm seeing John.

772
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:56,925
I've--
God, I've gotta be there in a half an hour.

773
00:42:57,097 --> 00:42:59,156
Come on. Houseman?

774
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,225
He must be, what, 30?

775
00:43:02,402 --> 00:43:05,030
What do you wanna hang around
with such an old guy for?

776
00:43:05,405 --> 00:43:06,599
He's balding.

777
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:09,139
- And how old are you?
- 18.

778
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:10,970
In December.

779
00:43:11,144 --> 00:43:14,341
Wouldn't you rather hang around
with someone young and vibrant...

780
00:43:14,514 --> 00:43:16,607
...than some old English guy?

781
00:43:16,783 --> 00:43:19,946
He's running an entire
theater company single-handedly...

782
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,089
...and offering me
a managerial position in it.

783
00:43:23,256 --> 00:43:25,019
What are you offering?

784
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:28,024
Wealth. Travel. Fame.

785
00:43:28,194 --> 00:43:31,686
I can take you to movies
that have all that.

786
00:43:36,536 --> 00:43:40,404
Orson's spending tomorrow night out
at Sneden's with Virginia.

787
00:43:40,573 --> 00:43:44,134
He lets me stay at his place in the village
when I work late here.

788
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,245
So if you want,
maybe tomorrow night we could go out.

789
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:48,711
Go dancing?

790
00:43:48,882 --> 00:43:51,942
Maybe stop by Orson's place for a drink?

791
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:54,917
Is that too terrifying for you?

792
00:43:57,457 --> 00:43:58,617
Are you kidding?

793
00:44:00,326 --> 00:44:02,123
Are you a married man or a bachelor?

794
00:44:02,295 --> 00:44:03,785
Answer every man directly.

795
00:44:03,963 --> 00:44:05,828
Aye, and briefly.

796
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:07,057
Aye, and truly.

797
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:08,928
Aye, and wisely.

798
00:44:09,102 --> 00:44:10,797
What is my name?

799
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,063
Whither am I going? Where do I dwell?

800
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:14,501
Enough.

801
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:16,539
This is worse than terrible.

802
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:19,405
Cinna is Shakespeare's indictment
of the intelligentsia.

803
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:21,979
He's a lofty, Byronic figure.

804
00:44:22,148 --> 00:44:25,140
You know, I completely disagree.

805
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:28,754
He's a street poet,
without a cent for a cigarette.

806
00:44:28,922 --> 00:44:30,150
Unshaved.

807
00:44:30,323 --> 00:44:32,587
Poems sticking out of his shoes.

808
00:44:32,759 --> 00:44:36,820
But the crowd are so crazy for blood,
they'll kill him anyway.

809
00:44:36,996 --> 00:44:41,456
Absurd interpretation.
Completely unjustified by the text.

810
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:45,463
Yet there may be something there
I can use.

811
00:45:48,134 --> 00:45:49,192
What's going on?

812
00:45:49,602 --> 00:45:52,537
I'm Cinna, the wet poet.

813
00:45:54,107 --> 00:45:55,734
Keep the water away from the board.

814
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:59,504
Somebody shut it off.
Shut that goddamn water off.

815
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,271
There's a cut-off in the basement.

816
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:03,540
Turn it the hell off. Turn it off.

817
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:16,694
Look at this shit house.
How the hell are we gonna open Thursday?

818
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:32,309
Welcome to the Mercury pool party.

819
00:46:32,478 --> 00:46:36,539
Leve's been saying the lights are too hot.
They're gonna have to be lowered.

820
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:40,144
What? And then re-aim them all?

821
00:46:40,653 --> 00:46:42,086
We'll never open on time.

822
00:46:42,288 --> 00:46:43,983
Try it now.

823
00:46:44,524 --> 00:46:47,516
About goddamn time.
Get your asses back in here.

824
00:46:47,694 --> 00:46:49,127
Clean this toilet up.

825
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:50,819
I'll show you a dictatorship.

826
00:46:50,997 --> 00:46:52,965
Come on now, get in here.

827
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,268
Anyone not on the ground
with a rag in his hand...

828
00:46:56,436 --> 00:46:58,802
...will be fired.
We're under martial law.

829
00:46:59,505 --> 00:47:01,370
Clean the theater seats first.

830
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:04,237
Jesus, that's all we need,
a dozen critics with wet asses.

831
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,275
And get more rags out here.

832
00:47:09,415 --> 00:47:12,816
These matches were on the floor
by the upstairs sprinklers.

833
00:47:16,956 --> 00:47:18,924
Sabotage.

834
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:22,923
It's not enough
that I work without sleep in this theater...

835
00:47:23,363 --> 00:47:26,264
...pour every dollar I make into it,
but now this.

836
00:47:26,432 --> 00:47:30,732
Someone deliberately and maliciously
attempting to wreck my show.

837
00:47:31,204 --> 00:47:34,696
I wanna know who is responsible.
Front and center, right this second.

838
00:47:36,676 --> 00:47:40,112
Whoever did this
will never work in New York again. Never.

839
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,647
I will fingerprint this box of matches.

840
00:47:45,385 --> 00:47:49,082
I want a name. And I want it now.

841
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,689
Can't be anybody in the Cinna scene
and that's everybody.

842
00:47:57,864 --> 00:47:59,798
It could have been anything.

843
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:02,196
There's matches
all over this goddamn theater.

844
00:48:02,368 --> 00:48:04,928
Leve says it's the lights.
Got to lower the light bar.

845
00:48:05,138 --> 00:48:08,767
What the hell does he know?
This is sabotage.

846
00:48:10,576 --> 00:48:13,875
Wait a second.
Where were you during all of this, junior?

847
00:48:14,414 --> 00:48:17,474
You weren't in this scene.
You weren't on-stage.

848
00:48:18,351 --> 00:48:20,285
You did this.

849
00:48:20,453 --> 00:48:22,284
Confess it or I'll beat it out of you.

850
00:48:22,455 --> 00:48:23,752
No, I was outside.

851
00:48:23,923 --> 00:48:25,720
Confess.

852
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:30,094
The bad-luck thing.

853
00:48:31,731 --> 00:48:34,029
Maybe this is just the bad-luck thing.

854
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:37,501
The bad-luck thing.

855
00:48:41,374 --> 00:48:43,035
Of course.

856
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:46,903
MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO:

857
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,447
If I get another call from
school today, because you're not there--

858
00:48:50,616 --> 00:48:52,607
Just think of this as an investment, Ma.

859
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:56,915
An investment in my future
as some kind of artist.

860
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:59,251
- Like your Uncle Frank?
- Oh, God.

861
00:48:59,425 --> 00:49:03,156
- Never kept a steady job his whole life.
- This is different.

862
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:05,957
Someday, everyone in this town
is gonna know who I am.

863
00:49:06,132 --> 00:49:07,497
Oh, sure.

864
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:11,433
You'll be the one
who didn't graduate from high school.

865
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,790
<i>Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness</i>

866
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:44,564
<i>Thou foster-child</i>
<i>Of silence and slow time</i>

867
00:49:44,937 --> 00:49:48,566
<i>Sylvan historian, who canst thus express</i>

868
00:49:48,741 --> 00:49:52,006
<i>A flowery tale more sweetly</i>
<i>Than our rhyme</i>

869
00:49:52,178 --> 00:49:53,736
Gretta?

870
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,914
I met you at Gaiety.
You were playing Gershwin--

871
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:59,643
Oh, right. The actor.

872
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:01,150
Yeah. Yeah.

873
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,754
Well, I'm more of an actor now.

874
00:50:03,923 --> 00:50:05,117
I, uh....

875
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:08,954
I just got a part
in Orson Welles' production, <i>Julius Caesar.</i>

876
00:50:09,128 --> 00:50:10,493
Yes, I'm sure.

877
00:50:10,663 --> 00:50:15,362
No. Really, I'm playing Lucius,
Brutus' servant.

878
00:50:15,535 --> 00:50:17,628
- You're not kidding me?
- No.

879
00:50:17,804 --> 00:50:19,135
We open Thursday.

880
00:50:19,305 --> 00:50:21,068
- That's great.
- Yeah.

881
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,935
I'll leave a ticket for you.

882
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:27,102
I'm just in a couple of scenes, you know?
But it's fun.

883
00:50:27,947 --> 00:50:29,414
What were you reciting?

884
00:50:29,582 --> 00:50:31,209
Keats.

885
00:50:31,384 --> 00:50:32,976
"Ode On A Grecian Urn."

886
00:50:34,086 --> 00:50:37,613
How can you not think of that poem
when you're here?

887
00:50:38,157 --> 00:50:39,647
Yeah.

888
00:50:40,226 --> 00:50:43,525
<i>When old age shall this generation waste</i>

889
00:50:43,996 --> 00:50:45,964
<i>Thou shalt remain</i>

890
00:50:46,132 --> 00:50:49,624
<i>In midst of other woe than ours</i>

891
00:50:49,902 --> 00:50:52,370
<i>A friend to man</i>

892
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:55,573
That's really nice.

893
00:50:57,276 --> 00:50:59,506
I shouldn't even be here.

894
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:02,307
I'm supposed to be working on my play.

895
00:51:02,482 --> 00:51:06,680
I haven't finished my three pages today.
Or yesterday.

896
00:51:06,853 --> 00:51:10,084
According to my timetable,
I'm actually 48 pages behind.

897
00:51:10,256 --> 00:51:11,689
RICHARD CHUCKLES:

898
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:15,658
But I finished a short story last night.

899
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:17,693
At 3:20 in the morning.

900
00:51:17,864 --> 00:51:20,731
I've got my stamped,
self-addressed envelope tucked inside...

901
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,993
...all ready for rejection.

902
00:51:23,169 --> 00:51:25,228
What's your story about?

903
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:27,266
This museum.

904
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,670
It's called <i>Hungry Generations</i>.

905
00:51:29,842 --> 00:51:31,434
It's just a sort of funny piece...

906
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:34,603
...about this girl who goes to the museum
whenever she's blue.

907
00:51:35,248 --> 00:51:37,113
And what happens?

908
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,184
What do you mean what happens?

909
00:51:41,387 --> 00:51:42,945
Nothing happens.

910
00:51:44,724 --> 00:51:46,919
Does something have to happen?

911
00:51:47,093 --> 00:51:48,390
No, I was just asking--

912
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:52,019
No, the whole story is,
this girl goes to the museum feeling blue...

913
00:51:52,198 --> 00:51:58,535
...and she thinks about time and eternity
and then she feels a little better.

914
00:51:58,704 --> 00:51:59,693
Oh.

915
00:51:59,872 --> 00:52:02,568
There's no action in it,
if that's what you're looking for.

916
00:52:02,742 --> 00:52:06,007
Why does everything have to have a plot?
All that melodramatic garbage.

917
00:52:06,178 --> 00:52:08,237
No, Gretta, I agree with you.

918
00:52:08,915 --> 00:52:10,780
The story sounds great.

919
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,884
Oh, no.

920
00:52:13,352 --> 00:52:14,546
Isn't this ridiculous?

921
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,087
You give me one funny look,
and I feel the whole story's worthless.

922
00:52:18,257 --> 00:52:20,919
No, I'm sure it's a wonderful story.

923
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,161
But listen,
there's this girl at the Mercury Theater.

924
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,163
She knows practically
everybody in New York.

925
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:31,099
And she told me she has a friend
in Harold Ross' office.

926
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:32,328
I bet if I asked her...

927
00:52:32,505 --> 00:52:35,736
...she could get her friend
to submit your story personally.

928
00:52:36,075 --> 00:52:37,940
Do you think she'd do that for me?

929
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:40,977
Well, I mean, I can ask.

930
00:52:41,147 --> 00:52:45,379
Maybe she could just put it on his desk.
I don't know.

931
00:52:46,085 --> 00:52:49,486
And you'd really give it to her?

932
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:52,317
You won't throw it in the garbage can
when you leave here?

933
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:55,517
- Steam it open and make fun of me?
- Okay, give it to me.

934
00:52:58,898 --> 00:53:05,201
You know, I came here
because I thought this urn would be lucky.

935
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:07,339
I wanted to touch the envelope on it.

936
00:53:07,506 --> 00:53:10,304
I really thought it would help me
get my story accepted.

937
00:53:11,444 --> 00:53:14,038
They should just lock me up.

938
00:53:14,981 --> 00:53:19,008
Well, if you believe in it, let's do it.

939
00:53:26,058 --> 00:53:28,219
Hey, don't touch that.

940
00:53:28,861 --> 00:53:30,886
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go. Go, go.

941
00:53:53,886 --> 00:53:57,344
Have you guys seen the ukulele?
You know, the lute?

942
00:53:57,523 --> 00:53:59,115
Sorry, kid.

943
00:54:02,461 --> 00:54:03,860
Damn.

944
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:10,193
Good night, my lord.

945
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:12,769
Lose the bow. Good night, good brother.

946
00:54:12,938 --> 00:54:14,530
- I like the bow.
- Lose it.

947
00:54:14,707 --> 00:54:16,402
Lucius.

948
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:18,538
Faster.

949
00:54:19,578 --> 00:54:20,602
Here, my good lord.

950
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,114
What, thou speak'st drowsily.
Poor--

951
00:54:25,284 --> 00:54:27,047
Where's thy ukulele, boy?

952
00:54:27,219 --> 00:54:29,312
I think some asshole doth stole it.

953
00:54:29,488 --> 00:54:32,480
Jesus Christ, this is some rehearsal.
Let's get to the end.

954
00:54:32,658 --> 00:54:34,592
Cue the finale.

955
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,788
ORCHESTRA PLAYING DRAMATIC MUSIC:

956
00:54:54,747 --> 00:54:55,736
LLOYD CHUCKLES:

957
00:54:55,915 --> 00:54:56,973
Okay, boys and girls...

958
00:54:57,149 --> 00:54:59,743
...we're finally closing in
on the son of a bitch.

959
00:55:01,087 --> 00:55:02,679
Then we have the company bow.

960
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:04,823
You don't say, Ash? How kind.

961
00:55:05,658 --> 00:55:06,818
There you are.

962
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:08,516
From the front, people.

963
00:55:08,694 --> 00:55:10,286
There you go.

964
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,155
Good. That's good.

965
00:55:13,332 --> 00:55:14,924
How long?

966
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:16,834
Ninety-four minutes.

967
00:55:17,002 --> 00:55:18,435
Rough.

968
00:55:18,604 --> 00:55:20,629
Okay, listen people.

969
00:55:21,707 --> 00:55:25,507
The big scenes are working pretty well,
but the transitions, they're endless.

970
00:55:25,678 --> 00:55:28,875
George Coulouris, start the oration lower.
You've got nowhere to go.

971
00:55:29,048 --> 00:55:32,347
Martin Gabel, tent scene,
slow the hell down.

972
00:55:32,518 --> 00:55:35,715
We're pushing the river.
Let the scene carry the baggage.

973
00:55:35,888 --> 00:55:38,789
Joe Holland,
when you play that last bit...

974
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:42,485
..."I am as constant as the Northern Star,"
more.

975
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:45,653
Nail your words to the back wall.
That goes for the rest of you.

976
00:55:45,831 --> 00:55:49,528
And step closer to the audience, Joe.
They've really got to hate you.

977
00:55:49,702 --> 00:55:53,570
Lloyd, Cinna the Poet's scene's out.

978
00:55:53,739 --> 00:55:55,366
- What?
- It never worked anyway.

979
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,634
Making it a blackout
and a musical interlude.

980
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,779
Jeannie Rosenthal,
we need to redo all the early cues.

981
00:56:00,946 --> 00:56:03,540
- We're using our best effects too soon.
- Okay.

982
00:56:03,716 --> 00:56:05,547
Evelyn Allen.

983
00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:08,981
You look absolutely beautiful, my angel.

984
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:11,123
But I can't hear a word you're saying.

985
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,555
All I can tell you is that if you refuse
to project on Thursday...

986
00:56:14,727 --> 00:56:16,456
...your theatrical career is over.

987
00:56:16,629 --> 00:56:20,292
Consonants, consonants, consonants.
And don't forget the vowels.

988
00:56:20,466 --> 00:56:24,562
And thunder drum man?
Much too loud, you're fighting the actors.

989
00:56:30,142 --> 00:56:31,302
Here, take a ticket.

990
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,439
Orson asked me
to give everybody these tickets.

991
00:56:34,613 --> 00:56:35,807
What's this for?

992
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:37,471
I don't know.

993
00:56:38,751 --> 00:56:42,983
Hey, fellas, do you think
my costume makes my ass look fat?

994
00:56:43,155 --> 00:56:44,452
- No.
- Are you sure?

995
00:56:44,623 --> 00:56:46,147
You look beautiful.

996
00:56:46,325 --> 00:56:48,987
Thank you. It's just all that fabric.

997
00:56:49,161 --> 00:56:51,686
- You're the most beautiful thing.
- You're a sweetheart.

998
00:56:51,864 --> 00:56:54,298
- Have you heard of the <i>Titanic?</i>
- Am I talking to you?

999
00:56:54,466 --> 00:56:57,799
Afterwards, I found this exquisite
little place in the village.

1000
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:01,701
Like no crowds. Just writers, artists.

1001
00:57:02,007 --> 00:57:05,067
- It's exactly the kind of place you'd love.
- Heh, heh. You think so?

1002
00:57:05,244 --> 00:57:07,508
Isn't that where they've got
that special on menu?

1003
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,945
Yeah, what's it called?
Quadruple Something?

1004
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:16,519
All right, children, front and center.

1005
00:57:16,689 --> 00:57:19,453
It's coming together,
but we still don't feel like a family.

1006
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,616
Good. I hate my family.

1007
00:57:21,794 --> 00:57:24,957
Come on now. Uncle Orson's got
a game he wants us all to play.

1008
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,859
- At this hour?
- I know what's coming.

1009
00:57:27,032 --> 00:57:28,693
I still think it's a good idea, Joe.

1010
00:57:28,868 --> 00:57:31,928
Right this second,
before you go home to your warm beds...

1011
00:57:32,104 --> 00:57:35,665
...every person in this company
is gonna take somebody out for a drink.

1012
00:57:35,841 --> 00:57:38,639
My treat, $5 a couple.

1013
00:57:39,044 --> 00:57:41,706
This is the advantage of radio.
They pay you in cash.

1014
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:44,145
Do we have to do this?
Seriously, I'm exhausted.

1015
00:57:44,316 --> 00:57:45,943
You, especially, have to do this.

1016
00:57:46,118 --> 00:57:48,780
Anyone who refuses is fired on the spot.

1017
00:57:48,954 --> 00:57:51,889
Aside from that,
it's strictly voluntary.

1018
00:57:52,057 --> 00:57:55,857
There aren't enough women to go around,
but we're very open-minded.

1019
00:57:56,028 --> 00:57:58,690
Everybody gets a ticket, including me.

1020
00:57:58,864 --> 00:58:00,991
Now, I've got a wallet...

1021
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:05,102
...full of crisp $5 bills here
that I'm determined to--

1022
00:58:05,271 --> 00:58:07,603
Jesus Christ.

1023
00:58:07,773 --> 00:58:09,263
ALL LAUGHING:

1024
00:58:13,445 --> 00:58:14,503
I'll go first.

1025
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:20,577
If I get Lloyd, I quit.

1026
00:58:22,521 --> 00:58:25,115
R1 1.

1027
00:58:27,326 --> 00:58:28,623
That's me.

1028
00:58:28,794 --> 00:58:30,125
ALL LAUGHING:

1029
00:58:30,296 --> 00:58:32,423
You make a lovely couple.

1030
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:37,466
- Can I pick again?
- It will do you good to have a night off.

1031
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:44,476
I don't really drink.

1032
00:58:44,643 --> 00:58:45,735
ALL LAUGH:

1033
00:58:45,911 --> 00:58:48,675
Alrighty, let's get this over with.

1034
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,041
AA8.

1035
00:58:53,986 --> 00:58:56,386
- Come on.
- Ah.

1036
00:58:56,822 --> 00:58:58,483
That seems to be my number.

1037
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:01,057
Oh, thank God. Someone I can talk to.

1038
00:59:01,226 --> 00:59:03,126
Better pick
before all the women are gone.

1039
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,162
Wait, let me go.
I have to go home, it's a school night.

1040
00:59:06,832 --> 00:59:10,393
No alcohol now, junior. I don't
wanna get any calls from your mother.

1041
00:59:12,471 --> 00:59:13,870
R23.

1042
00:59:16,442 --> 00:59:18,171
Come on now.

1043
00:59:18,344 --> 00:59:20,335
I think that's me.

1044
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:22,544
MEN WHISTLING & CHEERING:

1045
00:59:27,052 --> 00:59:29,885
I guess I should have held
on to my ticket, right?

1046
00:59:31,357 --> 00:59:33,655
Don't worry about it, junior.

1047
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:44,358
- Well, this must be my lucky night.
- Luck, huh?

1048
00:59:44,636 --> 00:59:47,662
I'm absolutely starving to death.

1049
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:52,104
<i>Nights like this were made for love</i>

1050
00:59:52,277 --> 00:59:55,769
<i>Regardless of the moon above</i>

1051
00:59:55,948 --> 00:59:58,940
<i>The time and place are opportune</i>

1052
00:59:59,718 --> 01:00:02,516
<i>Let's pretend that there's a moon</i>

1053
01:00:02,855 --> 01:00:06,689
<i>Poets like to tell about the spell</i>
<i>Of moonlight bliss</i>

1054
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:09,851
<i>They weave it into every rhyme</i>

1055
01:00:10,029 --> 01:00:13,829
<i>We don't need no moon above</i>
<i>To tell us when to kiss</i>

1056
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:17,366
<i>Why should we be wasting time</i>

1057
01:00:17,536 --> 01:00:21,199
<i>Here are we, here is love</i>

1058
01:00:21,373 --> 01:00:24,774
<i>Who cares if there's a moon above</i>

1059
01:00:24,943 --> 01:00:28,276
<i>We'll make believe that this is June</i>

1060
01:00:28,447 --> 01:00:31,746
<i>Let's pretend that there's a moon</i>

1061
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:36,015
I gave that short story
to my friend at <i>The New Yorker</i>.

1062
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:38,383
She said don't expect much.

1063
01:00:38,557 --> 01:00:41,219
Was it written by your girlfriend?

1064
01:00:41,393 --> 01:00:42,951
Which one?

1065
01:00:43,228 --> 01:00:45,992
Oh, dance, fool.

1066
01:00:55,307 --> 01:00:58,572
I don't understand
why I feel so comfortable with you.

1067
01:00:58,744 --> 01:01:00,803
I hardly know you.

1068
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:05,778
SONJA GIGGLING:

1069
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:10,887
You know the nicest thing
about this place?

1070
01:01:11,056 --> 01:01:13,024
It's got no heat?

1071
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,027
And it's got no telephone.

1072
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,358
It's Orson's illicit retreat.

1073
01:01:22,201 --> 01:01:24,829
It's freezing in here.

1074
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:27,632
I'll keep you warm.

1075
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:32,769
So where do your folks think
you are right now?

1076
01:01:32,945 --> 01:01:36,005
Oh, I told my mom
I was one millionth patron on the subway...

1077
01:01:36,181 --> 01:01:38,877
...and my prize was a free night
at the Plaza.

1078
01:01:39,251 --> 01:01:42,743
- Oh, brother. And she believed you?
- Probably not.

1079
01:01:42,921 --> 01:01:44,718
She's so grateful that I'm not dead...

1080
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:47,154
...that she'll suspend disbelief
until tomorrow.

1081
01:01:47,326 --> 01:01:49,317
Then she can kill me.

1082
01:01:53,565 --> 01:01:55,192
I'm gonna go find a nightgown.

1083
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,710
So they don't mind we're doing this?

1084
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,477
Well, I don't plan on telling them.
Do you?

1085
01:02:44,816 --> 01:02:49,378
We can leave the stuff in a hamper.
Somebody comes in to clean once a week.

1086
01:02:56,528 --> 01:02:58,962
Well, I guess I'll just sleep on the sofa.

1087
01:02:59,765 --> 01:03:01,926
Get in here, Richard.

1088
01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:37,129
Okay, fellas, after two beats.

1089
01:03:37,669 --> 01:03:40,763
ORCHESTRA PLAYING:

1090
01:03:41,707 --> 01:03:42,765
That's good.

1091
01:03:42,941 --> 01:03:45,102
Okay, next cue.

1092
01:03:45,911 --> 01:03:48,004
ORCHESTRA PLAYING:

1093
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,148
It's too fast.
I like the first one better.

1094
01:03:51,283 --> 01:03:52,910
We need more time to rehearse this.

1095
01:03:53,085 --> 01:03:54,848
You'll be fine, you're a professional.

1096
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,989
Every place I've put an X
that means you play a march.

1097
01:03:58,156 --> 01:04:01,057
Two X's mean a fanfare,
and three X's a drum roll.

1098
01:04:01,226 --> 01:04:05,060
Everywhere there's a circle,
just give me the sad horn melody.

1099
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:08,893
And the dotted line means thunder.
Got it?

1100
01:04:09,468 --> 01:04:11,436
Lloyd. Stop sulking.

1101
01:04:11,603 --> 01:04:15,835
--for these predictions
are to the world in general as to Caesar.

1102
01:04:16,008 --> 01:04:18,499
When beggars die
there are no comets seen.

1103
01:04:18,677 --> 01:04:21,510
The heavens themselves blaze forth
the death of princes.

1104
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,446
Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

1105
01:04:25,617 --> 01:04:28,609
The valiant never taste of death but once.

1106
01:04:30,022 --> 01:04:32,752
Of all the wonders that I have yet heard.

1107
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:37,619
It seems to me most strange
that men should fear, seeing that death--

1108
01:04:39,197 --> 01:04:42,689
Oh, pardon me,
thou bleeding piece of earth,

1109
01:04:42,868 --> 01:04:46,998
That I am meek and gentle
with these butchers!

1110
01:04:47,172 --> 01:04:49,333
ORCHESTRA PLAYS DRUM ROLL:

1111
01:04:54,746 --> 01:04:58,113
We will be satisfied. Let us be satisfied.

1112
01:04:58,283 --> 01:05:00,911
Then, follow me,
and give me audience, friends.

1113
01:05:02,487 --> 01:05:06,218
For chrissake, go back to what you had.
What are you doing to me?

1114
01:05:06,391 --> 01:05:09,758
Those that will follow me,
let them stay here.

1115
01:05:09,928 --> 01:05:13,364
Those that will follow Cassius,
go with him.

1116
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:22,937
There is tears for his love;
joy for his fortune;

1117
01:05:23,241 --> 01:05:29,407
honor for his valor;
and death for his ambition.

1118
01:05:29,581 --> 01:05:31,606
WOMAN COUGHING:

1119
01:05:33,318 --> 01:05:37,846
Who is here so base
that would be a bondman?

1120
01:05:38,023 --> 01:05:42,357
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

1121
01:05:42,661 --> 01:05:47,030
Who is here so vile
that will not love his country?

1122
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:53,366
If any, speak, for him I have offended.

1123
01:05:54,139 --> 01:05:56,369
I pause for a reply.

1124
01:06:04,216 --> 01:06:06,582
John, are we gonna fix the music?

1125
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:08,986
We wait for Orson.

1126
01:06:09,154 --> 01:06:10,712
Let's go back to what we had.

1127
01:06:11,056 --> 01:06:12,489
Wait for Orson.

1128
01:06:13,825 --> 01:06:16,123
Are we running this through
one more time tonight?

1129
01:06:16,294 --> 01:06:17,386
We wait for Orson.

1130
01:06:17,562 --> 01:06:20,190
And how long do we intend to wait?

1131
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:27,998
This is the essential Orson Welles moment,
isn't it?

1132
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:31,035
The whole show is in shambles.

1133
01:06:31,209 --> 01:06:34,110
We open in under 24 hours.

1134
01:06:34,279 --> 01:06:39,148
The entire vessel is keeling over,
there is water breaching the deck.

1135
01:06:39,317 --> 01:06:40,716
But wait.

1136
01:06:40,886 --> 01:06:42,911
There's one man who can save us.

1137
01:06:43,221 --> 01:06:44,848
IMITATES SOUND
OF SWORD SWOOSHING:

1138
01:06:45,023 --> 01:06:48,789
There's one man with the imagination,
with the vision.

1139
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,360
From the beginning.

1140
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:55,159
We go over the whole goddamn show
from the very beginning.

1141
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:57,324
Once more into the breach.

1142
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,797
I need to talk to you, Mr. Welles.

1143
01:06:59,971 --> 01:07:02,303
There's a mistake here which needs
to be corrected.

1144
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:05,671
There is no mention here at all
that I designed the sets--

1145
01:07:05,844 --> 01:07:10,008
From my sketches.
Every moment of this show is mine, Sam.

1146
01:07:10,782 --> 01:07:12,147
The concept is mine.

1147
01:07:12,317 --> 01:07:15,013
It existed long before you came.
John will vouch for that.

1148
01:07:15,187 --> 01:07:17,815
You did a fine job
in a technical capacity...

1149
01:07:17,989 --> 01:07:20,719
...and I'm grateful for your help
as a carpenter.

1150
01:07:20,892 --> 01:07:22,484
A carpenter.

1151
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:24,822
You insult me, Mr. Orson Welles.

1152
01:07:24,996 --> 01:07:28,397
Sam. I'm sure we can get this rectified.

1153
01:07:28,567 --> 01:07:30,797
- There's nothing to rectify.
- Fine.

1154
01:07:30,969 --> 01:07:32,664
Then I'm gonna get my hammer...

1155
01:07:32,838 --> 01:07:36,740
...and I'm gonna tear this set apart,
board by board.

1156
01:07:36,908 --> 01:07:37,932
Son of a bitch.

1157
01:07:38,109 --> 01:07:42,375
Sam! Sam. We'll work this out.

1158
01:07:43,014 --> 01:07:46,040
I give you my word. As a gentleman.

1159
01:07:46,218 --> 01:07:50,177
You are a gentleman, Mr. Houseman.
He is an arrogant, selfish--

1160
01:07:50,355 --> 01:07:52,414
I am Orson Welles.

1161
01:07:52,591 --> 01:07:55,856
And every single one of you stands here
as an adjunct to my vision.

1162
01:07:56,027 --> 01:07:59,690
You want a career in the Mercury Theater
and in everything else I plan to do?

1163
01:07:59,865 --> 01:08:04,302
Then remember one simple rule:
I own the store.

1164
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:07,965
You don't like the way I work?
There's the door.

1165
01:08:08,607 --> 01:08:11,633
Find somebody else
to star you on Broadway.

1166
01:08:12,344 --> 01:08:14,244
We open tomorrow.

1167
01:08:16,248 --> 01:08:19,479
I'm proud of every member
of this company.

1168
01:08:19,818 --> 01:08:22,378
Every single one of you
has come through.

1169
01:08:23,221 --> 01:08:24,688
You're a magnificent company...

1170
01:08:24,856 --> 01:08:27,757
...on par with any theatrical company
in the world.

1171
01:08:29,094 --> 01:08:30,789
And after tomorrow...

1172
01:08:30,962 --> 01:08:35,058
...every literate person in this city
is gonna know who we are.

1173
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:38,259
They'll be lining up for the privilege
of seeing our work.

1174
01:08:39,604 --> 01:08:41,834
Now, let's run through it again.

1175
01:08:42,374 --> 01:08:43,898
Come on.

1176
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,645
Sam.

1177
01:08:50,048 --> 01:08:52,107
I know what you've done
for this production.

1178
01:08:52,284 --> 01:08:53,581
We all do.

1179
01:08:53,752 --> 01:08:55,845
Even Orson knows.

1180
01:08:56,588 --> 01:08:58,920
He is young, Sam. Forgive him that.

1181
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:02,753
Now, I promise,
I'll do what I can for you.

1182
01:09:04,195 --> 01:09:05,423
Thank you.

1183
01:09:17,309 --> 01:09:21,302
Orson's gonna be here till daybreak.
I'm gonna be here even later.

1184
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:23,538
You should get some sleep.
You open tomorrow.

1185
01:09:23,715 --> 01:09:26,343
Which is now almost today.

1186
01:09:26,518 --> 01:09:30,284
- Everybody else can sleep all morning.
- I could sleep all morning too.

1187
01:09:30,455 --> 01:09:33,754
School feels like another universe
to me right now.

1188
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:35,859
An insignificant universe.

1189
01:09:36,227 --> 01:09:39,287
And I'm asking you out
to breakfast before anybody else.

1190
01:09:39,464 --> 01:09:41,455
So you can't say no.

1191
01:09:45,870 --> 01:09:48,270
Let's put a sign there.
"Opening night sold out."

1192
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,567
It will look good,
and we'll paper the house.

1193
01:09:50,742 --> 01:09:52,403
I'm going home to get a little rest.

1194
01:09:52,577 --> 01:09:54,272
Well, I envy you your rest.

1195
01:09:54,446 --> 01:09:56,505
You can over-rehearse, you know.

1196
01:09:58,116 --> 01:09:59,549
One more run-through.

1197
01:10:00,018 --> 01:10:02,452
At this point,
could it possibly make any difference?

1198
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:05,784
Are you kidding?
This is when the magic happens.

1199
01:10:05,957 --> 01:10:07,948
CLOCK CHIMING:

1200
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:13,494
We have heard the chimes at midnight,
Master Shallow.

1201
01:10:13,732 --> 01:10:15,393
Good night, Orson.

1202
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:17,262
Good night, Jack.

1203
01:10:19,504 --> 01:10:21,028
Thank you.

1204
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:34,484
I know young bloods
look for a time of rest.

1205
01:10:34,886 --> 01:10:36,478
I have slept, my lord already.

1206
01:10:36,655 --> 01:10:39,988
It was well done,
and thou shalt sleep again.

1207
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:41,216
Really, I'm fine.

1208
01:10:42,794 --> 01:10:45,319
Lucius, I love you beyond measure.

1209
01:10:45,497 --> 01:10:48,933
You're the one person in this company
who doesn't need any more rehearsal.

1210
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:53,768
You are what I call a God-created actor.

1211
01:10:54,139 --> 01:10:56,664
When you're on-stage, you register.

1212
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:59,173
I look at you, and you know what I see?

1213
01:11:00,612 --> 01:11:02,705
Images of magnificence.

1214
01:11:03,281 --> 01:11:04,748
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

1215
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:07,345
- Sonja, I need you inside.
- Yeah, one minute.

1216
01:11:13,692 --> 01:11:15,557
Magnificence.

1217
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:18,357
BOTH CHUCKLE:

1218
01:11:19,664 --> 01:11:21,029
SIGHS:

1219
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,258
Orson wants to stay with me tonight.

1220
01:11:25,503 --> 01:11:28,995
- Stay with you tonight?
- I'm in no position to refuse.

1221
01:11:29,808 --> 01:11:31,070
What are you talking about?

1222
01:11:31,242 --> 01:11:35,372
I have to watch out for myself.
That's what my whole life has taught me.

1223
01:11:35,547 --> 01:11:38,015
- I'll watch out for you.
- No, you can't, Richard.

1224
01:11:38,183 --> 01:11:42,381
- Yes, I can.
- Just get some rest.

1225
01:11:42,554 --> 01:11:45,785
- Sonja.
- You're not gonna win this one.

1226
01:12:02,407 --> 01:12:03,897
Richard.

1227
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:10,077
Sorry for listening.

1228
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,710
You want some advice from an old pro?

1229
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:21,281
Sure.

1230
01:12:22,894 --> 01:12:26,591
Fight for her. That's what she wants.

1231
01:12:30,168 --> 01:12:32,500
I'm not sure if that's who I am.

1232
01:12:34,172 --> 01:12:38,336
And who you are,
is that who you wanna be?

1233
01:12:40,745 --> 01:12:42,178
Good night, kid.

1234
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,131
ORSON & SONJA LAUGHING:

1235
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:04,859
Good God, listen to this.

1236
01:13:05,036 --> 01:13:09,700
"Slowly paced,
incompetently spoken, badly edited...

1237
01:13:09,874 --> 01:13:11,899
...this <i>Anthony and Cleopatra--"</i>

1238
01:13:12,076 --> 01:13:13,100
Anthony with an H.

1239
01:13:13,278 --> 01:13:15,974
Christ. Atkinson can't even get the name
of the play right.

1240
01:13:16,147 --> 01:13:18,411
<i>"Anthony and Cleopatra</i>
is a considerable trial...

1241
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:21,051
...of an audience's patience
and goodwill."

1242
01:13:21,219 --> 01:13:23,710
Ha, ha. God, this is priceless.

1243
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:27,487
Lucius, old man.

1244
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:30,651
What brings you down
to these remote parts of the isle?

1245
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:33,992
Gonna be one of those magic nights
tonight. Can you feel it?

1246
01:13:34,165 --> 01:13:35,189
Get us a cab, kid.

1247
01:13:35,366 --> 01:13:37,493
Sonja, let me see <i>The Post.</i>

1248
01:13:39,003 --> 01:13:40,834
ORSON LAUGHING:

1249
01:13:47,212 --> 01:13:49,442
What are you doing here?

1250
01:13:50,415 --> 01:13:52,849
I didn't think
you'd actually stay with him.

1251
01:13:53,451 --> 01:13:56,909
I told you what I was doing.
I'm not sorry.

1252
01:14:02,026 --> 01:14:04,654
You've only known me for a week.

1253
01:14:04,829 --> 01:14:07,525
Don't you think
your wounded silence is melodramatic?

1254
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:11,157
You know, sometimes you remember
a week for the rest of your life.

1255
01:14:11,903 --> 01:14:14,098
Well, then,
let's be grateful we had a week.

1256
01:14:18,309 --> 01:14:20,368
Want me to fight for you?

1257
01:14:20,545 --> 01:14:22,206
Is that what you want?

1258
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:23,404
Because I will.

1259
01:14:23,948 --> 01:14:28,078
Fight for me?
Orson's gonna introduce me to Selznick.

1260
01:14:28,253 --> 01:14:30,551
And Selznick makes this morally right?

1261
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:32,155
Morally right?

1262
01:14:32,323 --> 01:14:34,518
I would never do to you
what you just did to me.

1263
01:14:34,692 --> 01:14:38,423
Oh, you're so above ambition?
You're so morally high and righteous.

1264
01:14:38,596 --> 01:14:41,929
Let's go, junior, we're late already.
We've got half a dozen interviews.

1265
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,432
First off, my name's not "junior."

1266
01:14:45,136 --> 01:14:47,468
- What?
- Or "kid."

1267
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:49,607
Or Lucius.

1268
01:14:49,774 --> 01:14:51,241
My name's Richard.

1269
01:14:51,876 --> 01:14:53,275
That's what I wanna be called.

1270
01:14:53,444 --> 01:14:54,468
Get in the cab.

1271
01:14:54,646 --> 01:14:55,943
This concerns me too, Orson.

1272
01:14:56,114 --> 01:14:57,979
Get in the cab.

1273
01:15:00,685 --> 01:15:02,949
Now, what exactly
is your problem, junior?

1274
01:15:03,121 --> 01:15:05,055
You're picking
the wrong day to upset me.

1275
01:15:05,223 --> 01:15:07,384
Sonja is my lover.

1276
01:15:07,558 --> 01:15:09,617
Your lover? Ha, ha.

1277
01:15:09,794 --> 01:15:11,421
She's my girlfriend.

1278
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:12,790
And you're angry with me?

1279
01:15:12,964 --> 01:15:17,128
Don't you think Mistress Quickly
over there deserves a little of the blame?

1280
01:15:17,302 --> 01:15:18,633
I'm asking you to back off.

1281
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:22,437
You have a pregnant wife,
for chrissakes, what are you--?

1282
01:15:22,607 --> 01:15:26,543
You mention my wife again, I'll break
your neck, you talentless little shit.

1283
01:15:26,711 --> 01:15:28,645
You wanna open the show
without a Lucius?

1284
01:15:28,813 --> 01:15:31,111
I'll cut your scene in two seconds.

1285
01:15:31,282 --> 01:15:33,307
Start cutting.

1286
01:15:33,484 --> 01:15:35,679
Don't worry about quitting
because you're fired.

1287
01:15:35,853 --> 01:15:37,787
Effective this second.

1288
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:41,754
You've got half an hour
to get your stuff out of my theater.

1289
01:15:41,926 --> 01:15:45,885
I hope you enjoyed your Broadway
career, junior, because it's over.

1290
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,443
Would you put that back?
Don't you know Orson yet?

1291
01:16:04,615 --> 01:16:06,606
He pulls this before every show.

1292
01:16:06,784 --> 01:16:09,548
He just wants you to kiss his ass.

1293
01:16:09,721 --> 01:16:13,248
I was the star of <i>Horse Eats Hat.</i>
He fired me two hours before we opened...

1294
01:16:13,424 --> 01:16:16,154
...just because I hammered
Henrietta Kaye before he did.

1295
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:18,625
For chrissake, just apologize to him.

1296
01:16:18,796 --> 01:16:20,821
Look, you can't quit anyway.

1297
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:22,591
We still owe you five bucks.

1298
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,965
We're not paying you
until we get all the details.

1299
01:16:26,471 --> 01:16:28,200
Richard, apologize.

1300
01:16:29,107 --> 01:16:31,837
He called me a talentless little shit.

1301
01:16:32,276 --> 01:16:34,972
I don't think "talentless little shit"
is so bad.

1302
01:16:35,146 --> 01:16:37,842
I mean, it's better
than unemployed talentless little shit.

1303
01:16:38,016 --> 01:16:41,281
- Shut up.
- I'm explaining to him how the world works.

1304
01:16:41,452 --> 01:16:44,080
Look, Welles is the boss.

1305
01:16:44,255 --> 01:16:46,553
Just tell him any crap he wants to hear.

1306
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:49,290
Who cares if you believe it?

1307
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,952
Richard, I'm pleading with you.
Do it for me.

1308
01:16:53,131 --> 01:16:55,190
Do it because you love the show.

1309
01:17:12,283 --> 01:17:13,773
Richard, old man.

1310
01:17:14,185 --> 01:17:16,745
Joe said I might find you here.

1311
01:17:17,088 --> 01:17:19,784
What can I tell you? That I'm sorry?

1312
01:17:21,426 --> 01:17:23,394
That we need you?

1313
01:17:23,828 --> 01:17:26,388
Those words are paltry
and inadequate to describe the--

1314
01:17:26,564 --> 01:17:28,532
Why don't you skip all the bunk.

1315
01:17:28,699 --> 01:17:30,394
Whatever you say.

1316
01:17:33,571 --> 01:17:35,903
All I wanted
was to be treated with respect.

1317
01:17:36,074 --> 01:17:38,770
Never my intention
to treat you any other way, junior.

1318
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:40,672
Don't call me junior.

1319
01:17:40,845 --> 01:17:42,779
Sorry. I use the term affectionately.

1320
01:17:42,947 --> 01:17:44,471
Well, it diminishes me.

1321
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:46,708
Then no more.

1322
01:17:48,186 --> 01:17:51,349
You really are
a God-created actor, Richard.

1323
01:17:51,522 --> 01:17:54,582
Those weren't just words, you see.
I recognize the look.

1324
01:17:56,394 --> 01:17:58,259
The look?

1325
01:17:58,429 --> 01:18:02,798
The bone-deep understanding that your life
is so utterly without meaning...

1326
01:18:02,967 --> 01:18:06,528
...that simply to survive,
you have to reinvent yourself.

1327
01:18:07,805 --> 01:18:10,899
Because if people can't find you...

1328
01:18:11,909 --> 01:18:14,139
...they can't dislike you.

1329
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:17,573
You see, if I can be Brutus
for 90 minutes tonight--

1330
01:18:17,748 --> 01:18:21,946
I mean really be him,
from the inside out.

1331
01:18:22,653 --> 01:18:28,319
--then for 90 minutes, I get this
miraculous reprieve from being myself.

1332
01:18:30,128 --> 01:18:33,859
That's what you see
in every great actor's eyes, you know.

1333
01:18:35,766 --> 01:18:37,427
Cigar?

1334
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:39,927
Cuban.

1335
01:18:42,874 --> 01:18:44,398
Sure.

1336
01:18:47,612 --> 01:18:49,842
You may not like me, Richard.

1337
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:52,976
And frankly, it's irrelevant
to me whether or not you do.

1338
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:56,552
Our business together
is to create the best art we can.

1339
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:59,281
That's all that matters in this world.

1340
01:18:59,957 --> 01:19:02,687
But I'm asking you
to give me this opening night.

1341
01:19:03,094 --> 01:19:06,860
After tonight,
you can do whatever you want.

1342
01:19:08,199 --> 01:19:10,565
I need you. Don't think about it.

1343
01:19:10,735 --> 01:19:12,566
Say, "Yes, Orson."

1344
01:19:12,737 --> 01:19:14,398
Say yes right now.

1345
01:19:16,908 --> 01:19:20,776
You'll call my mother? You'll tell her
that I'm an important part of the show...

1346
01:19:20,945 --> 01:19:23,607
...and that it's necessary
that I miss some school?

1347
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:25,408
Of course.

1348
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,187
And the cast party tonight
at Tony's, I get an invitation?

1349
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:33,983
Naturally.

1350
01:19:37,695 --> 01:19:40,459
And Sam Leve gets his proper credit.

1351
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:43,663
Jesus, what an operator.

1352
01:19:43,834 --> 01:19:46,359
You want a position
in the Roosevelt cabinet as well?

1353
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:48,903
- Will you tell me we have a deal already?
- Deal.

1354
01:20:25,276 --> 01:20:27,176
Now, two X's mean a fanfare.

1355
01:20:27,345 --> 01:20:28,369
For chrissakes, Orson.

1356
01:20:28,546 --> 01:20:31,947
If you want a fanfare, then just
write the word "fanfare" in the script.

1357
01:20:32,116 --> 01:20:34,243
Muriel, sweetheart, darling...

1358
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:38,616
...light of the New York stage,
no jewelry on Portia.

1359
01:20:38,789 --> 01:20:40,017
Orson.

1360
01:20:40,691 --> 01:20:44,525
Orson, Coulouris says he can't go on.
He says he's having a heart attack.

1361
01:20:44,695 --> 01:20:47,220
I think it's just nerves,
but I've called an ambulance.

1362
01:20:47,398 --> 01:20:49,923
- What the hell? Coulouris?
- I've put him in your room.

1363
01:20:50,101 --> 01:20:51,500
Jesus Christ.

1364
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:55,537
Lloyd, Cinna's the Poet's scene is back in.
I'm adding more people to the mob.

1365
01:20:55,706 --> 01:20:58,300
When they completely surround you,
run down the ramp.

1366
01:20:58,476 --> 01:21:01,104
It will look like you're wiped off
the face of the earth.

1367
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:03,042
Ash, all hands on deck.

1368
01:21:03,214 --> 01:21:05,045
Get every available body in that scene.

1369
01:21:05,216 --> 01:21:07,047
Including you. In overcoats and hats.

1370
01:21:07,218 --> 01:21:11,018
Two steaks, one pineapple,
and a bottle of Scotch for Mr. Welles.

1371
01:21:11,188 --> 01:21:12,314
Thank you, John.

1372
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,616
Thank you, Mr. Welles.

1373
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:16,191
Junior, take this for me.

1374
01:21:16,527 --> 01:21:18,620
- Richard.
- I don't have the time for this now.

1375
01:21:18,796 --> 01:21:21,390
- Did you tune the uke?
- Yeah, it's ready.

1376
01:21:21,565 --> 01:21:24,125
Mercury benefactors, good evening.

1377
01:21:24,302 --> 01:21:26,395
- Hello.
- How are you?

1378
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:27,594
Enjoy the show.

1379
01:21:27,772 --> 01:21:30,639
Now, let's see
what the hell this is all about.

1380
01:21:31,876 --> 01:21:33,173
Thank you.

1381
01:21:34,879 --> 01:21:36,244
Calm down. Just breathe.

1382
01:21:36,414 --> 01:21:38,644
I can't do it. No, I can't do it.

1383
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:41,376
- I can't do it.
- You'll be fine, George, perfectly fine.

1384
01:21:41,552 --> 01:21:44,282
It's just the opening night willies.

1385
01:21:45,089 --> 01:21:46,579
ORSON TURNS OFF MUSIC
ON RADIO:

1386
01:21:46,757 --> 01:21:48,156
Give me that bottle of Scotch.

1387
01:21:50,494 --> 01:21:52,428
Everybody outside.

1388
01:21:54,732 --> 01:21:57,428
I didn't know what to say to him.

1389
01:22:06,711 --> 01:22:08,338
Look at me. Shh.

1390
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,104
Look at me.

1391
01:22:10,281 --> 01:22:12,579
I want you to hear every word I say.

1392
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:14,342
You understand me?

1393
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:16,918
Please don't make me do this.
Don't make me do this.

1394
01:22:17,088 --> 01:22:19,249
- Listen, George. Shh.
- Don't make me do this, Orson.

1395
01:22:19,423 --> 01:22:21,618
Come on. Come on now.

1396
01:22:21,792 --> 01:22:24,192
There are some actors-- Listen, George.

1397
01:22:24,362 --> 01:22:28,560
There are some actors who will study,
and practice and work their whole lives...

1398
01:22:28,733 --> 01:22:31,896
...and they'll be decent actors,
and they'll get decent reviews.

1399
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:34,867
But there are other actors--
Listen, George.

1400
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:37,735
There are other actors
whom I call God-created.

1401
01:22:37,908 --> 01:22:39,136
No, no, no, no, no.

1402
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:40,504
No, not me, not me, Orson.

1403
01:22:40,678 --> 01:22:43,238
- Never me. I'm not God-created.
- Look at me, look at me.

1404
01:22:43,414 --> 01:22:46,144
When I look in your eyes,
do you know what I see?

1405
01:22:46,684 --> 01:22:50,552
I see images of magnificence.

1406
01:22:52,323 --> 01:22:53,813
I see--

1407
01:22:55,192 --> 01:23:00,289
I see an Antony
about to create theatrical history.

1408
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:03,791
Now come on, now.

1409
01:23:03,968 --> 01:23:05,333
Take a drink of this.

1410
01:23:05,503 --> 01:23:07,368
We're gonna do this.

1411
01:23:10,808 --> 01:23:12,742
I couldn't catch my breath.

1412
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:14,707
Drink this.

1413
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:19,041
I'm so sorry, Orson.

1414
01:23:19,216 --> 01:23:20,979
No, don't worry about it.

1415
01:23:21,652 --> 01:23:23,017
I'm so ashamed.

1416
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:25,587
CHATTERING:

1417
01:23:48,212 --> 01:23:50,772
Come on, George.

1418
01:23:51,015 --> 01:23:53,813
BREATHING HEAVILY:

1419
01:23:57,688 --> 01:24:00,418
Come on, George.

1420
01:24:01,492 --> 01:24:02,823
Augusta? Orson.

1421
01:24:02,993 --> 01:24:06,793
Anybody shows up late, hold them till
the blackout before the conspirators scene.

1422
01:24:06,964 --> 01:24:08,363
Is that understood?

1423
01:24:08,532 --> 01:24:12,161
Those back doors
do not open for Jesus Christ himself.

1424
01:24:12,803 --> 01:24:15,897
- How many friends in the balcony?
- About 40.

1425
01:24:16,073 --> 01:24:18,735
All right, let's rip their throats out.

1426
01:24:18,909 --> 01:24:21,070
Jeannie, show time.

1427
01:24:21,245 --> 01:24:22,712
Loud, fellas.

1428
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,144
Wake the sons of bitches up.

1429
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:29,881
This is the night that either makes me...

1430
01:24:30,588 --> 01:24:33,455
...or fordoes me quite.

1431
01:24:40,698 --> 01:24:42,723
Hold the music till I cue you.

1432
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:44,629
Four beats.

1433
01:24:44,802 --> 01:24:49,262
Three, two, one.

1434
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,408
Make them sweat.

1435
01:24:52,076 --> 01:24:54,738
- And music.
- One, two.

1436
01:24:58,516 --> 01:25:01,644
ORCHESTRA PLAYING:

1437
01:25:13,764 --> 01:25:15,026
Caesar.

1438
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,190
Caesar.

1439
01:25:20,037 --> 01:25:21,163
Peace.

1440
01:25:21,338 --> 01:25:23,363
Bid every noise be still.

1441
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:24,633
Caesar.

1442
01:25:24,808 --> 01:25:28,244
Who is it in the throng that calls on me?

1443
01:25:29,013 --> 01:25:30,412
- Mark Antony.
- Caesar, my Lord.

1444
01:25:30,581 --> 01:25:34,278
I hear a tongue,
shriller than all the music, cry "Caesar."

1445
01:25:34,451 --> 01:25:35,884
- Caesar.
- Hal

1446
01:25:36,353 --> 01:25:41,985
Who calls? Speak. Caesar is turn'd to hear.

1447
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:45,617
Beware the ides of March.

1448
01:25:45,796 --> 01:25:49,232
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face.

1449
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:52,392
But when he once attains the upmost round.

1450
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:54,800
He then unto the ladder turns his back,

1451
01:25:54,972 --> 01:25:58,965
Looks in the clouds,
scorning the base degrees

1452
01:25:59,143 --> 01:26:04,046
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.

1453
01:26:04,214 --> 01:26:07,308
Then, lest he may, prevent.

1454
01:26:09,186 --> 01:26:10,881
Brutus, my lord.

1455
01:26:11,055 --> 01:26:13,888
Portia, what mean you?

1456
01:26:14,058 --> 01:26:15,491
Wherefore rise you now?

1457
01:26:15,659 --> 01:26:21,529
It is not for your health thus to commit your
weak condition to the raw cold morning.

1458
01:26:21,699 --> 01:26:23,496
Nor for yours neither.

1459
01:26:24,134 --> 01:26:27,126
You've ungently, Brutus,
Stole from my bed:

1460
01:26:27,304 --> 01:26:28,896
You can tell they've screwed.

1461
01:26:29,073 --> 01:26:33,942
and yesternight, at supper,
you suddenly arose, and walk'd about,

1462
01:26:34,111 --> 01:26:37,911
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,

1463
01:26:38,082 --> 01:26:41,074
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,

1464
01:26:41,251 --> 01:26:44,652
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;

1465
01:26:44,822 --> 01:26:49,850
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
Gave sign for me to leave you:

1466
01:26:51,161 --> 01:26:53,129
Between the acting of a dreadful thing--

1467
01:26:53,297 --> 01:26:56,198
Damn it,
I asked him not to stand there.

1468
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:57,766
You were great.

1469
01:26:57,935 --> 01:26:59,664
Was I really?

1470
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:04,604
You're what I call a God-created actress.

1471
01:27:05,643 --> 01:27:06,667
I think I love you.

1472
01:27:06,844 --> 01:27:12,544
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
The nature of an insurrection.

1473
01:27:12,716 --> 01:27:13,808
If he be so resolved....

1474
01:27:13,984 --> 01:27:15,383
Nervous?

1475
01:27:15,552 --> 01:27:17,747
Only if people ask me if I'm nervous.

1476
01:27:17,921 --> 01:27:20,515
And I will bring him to the capital.

1477
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:22,750
- We will always be there....
- You nervous?

1478
01:27:22,926 --> 01:27:25,895
By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost?

1479
01:27:26,063 --> 01:27:28,657
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

1480
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,074
Here is a sick man
that would speak with you.

1481
01:27:39,243 --> 01:27:40,733
Caius Ligarius.

1482
01:27:40,911 --> 01:27:47,111
I am not sick, if Brutus have in
hand any exploit worthy the name of honor.

AUDIENCE GASP:

01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:15,237
Then fall, Caesar.

1488
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:26,322
O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel
the dint of pity.

1489
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:28,981
These are gracious drops.

1490
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:36,356
Kind souls, what, weep you when you
but behold Our Caesar's vesture wounded?

1491
01:28:36,934 --> 01:28:38,492
Look you here,

MEN GASP:

1493
01:28:39,937 --> 01:28:44,965
Here is himself, marr'd,
as you see, with traitors.

1494
01:28:45,142 --> 01:28:46,166
- Caesar.
- Caesar.

1495
01:28:46,343 --> 01:28:47,708
O piteous spectacle!

1496
01:28:47,878 --> 01:28:51,075
O traitors!

1497
01:28:52,883 --> 01:28:54,214
- Revenge.

1498
01:28:54,384 --> 01:28:55,783

Revenge!

1502
01:29:07,297 --> 01:29:11,734
I dreamt to-night that I did feast
with Caesar,

1503
01:29:11,902 --> 01:29:16,236
And things unlucky charge my fantasy:

1504
01:29:16,406 --> 01:29:20,866
I have no will to wander forth of doors,

1505
01:29:21,044 --> 01:29:24,775
Yet something leads me forth.

1506
01:29:26,083 --> 01:29:27,710
What is your name?

1507
01:29:29,419 --> 01:29:31,580
Whither are you going?

1508
01:29:32,489 --> 01:29:34,616
Where do you dwell?

1509
01:29:39,863 --> 01:29:41,057
His name is Cinna.

1510
01:29:41,231 --> 01:29:43,426
I am Cinna the poet.

1511
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,363
Tear him for his bad verses.

1512
01:29:45,536 --> 01:29:49,802
I am not Cinna the conspirator.

1513
01:29:50,207 --> 01:29:54,439
I am Cinna the poet!

Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile...

1516
01:30:07,891 --> 01:30:10,826
...and touch thy instrument a strain or two?

1517
01:30:10,994 --> 01:30:12,655
Ay, my lord, an't please you.

1518
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:19,030
It does, my boy: I trouble thee
too much, but thou art willing.

1519
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:20,568
It is my duty, sir.

1520
01:30:20,737 --> 01:30:24,173
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;

1521
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:27,640
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

1522
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:30,507
I have slept, my lord, already.

1523
01:30:30,681 --> 01:30:35,277
It was well done;
and thou shalt sleep again;

1524
01:30:35,452 --> 01:30:37,647
I will not hold thee long:

This was the noblest Roman of them all:

01:31:57,901 --> 01:32:00,563
All the conspirators save only he

1537
01:32:00,737 --> 01:32:04,002
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;

1538
01:32:04,174 --> 01:32:07,268
He only, in a general honest thought

1539
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:10,607
And common good to all,
made one of them.

1540
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:13,909
His life was gentle, and the elements

1541
01:32:14,084 --> 01:32:17,952
So mix'd in him that Nature
might stand up

1542
01:32:18,121 --> 01:32:23,821
And say to all the world:
"This was a man!"

01:34:17,274 --> 01:34:19,401
Have you ever seen
an audience react like that?

1568
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:21,942
- No.
- Once.

1569
01:34:22,112 --> 01:34:23,340
Tonight.

1570
01:34:23,513 --> 01:34:24,946
ALL LAUGHING:

1571
01:34:25,382 --> 01:34:27,373
Orson's been planning this production...

1572
01:34:27,551 --> 01:34:29,416
...the sets and the lights
in his mind for years.

1573
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:32,214
And he first directed
<i>Julius Caesar</i> at the Todd School.

1574
01:34:32,389 --> 01:34:34,084
Have you met Martin Gabel?

1575
01:34:34,257 --> 01:34:36,691
He's our Cassius. Tremendous.

1576
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:40,318
Orson and I,
we're just so simpatico, I guess.

1577
01:34:40,497 --> 01:34:42,727
You know, I prefer working with men.

1578
01:34:42,899 --> 01:34:45,129
I could never do the play <i>The Women.</i>

1579
01:34:45,302 --> 01:34:46,929
Forty characters, all women.

1580
01:34:47,104 --> 01:34:50,164
My God, I would shoot myself.
I need to be around men.

1581
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:55,539
I realized with a startling clarity,
from the very first rehearsal...

1582
01:34:55,712 --> 01:34:57,577
...that this was destined for greatness.

1583
01:34:57,747 --> 01:34:58,771
I can see that.

1584
01:34:58,949 --> 01:35:02,407
Orson, in fact, offered me
the part of both Mark Antony or Brutus.

1585
01:35:02,586 --> 01:35:05,487
I selected Mark Antony
because he's universally acknowledged...

1586
01:35:05,655 --> 01:35:07,418
...as the pivotal role in the play....

1587
01:35:07,591 --> 01:35:09,218
Oh, really?

1588
01:35:09,392 --> 01:35:11,485
I guess I can be talked into it.

1589
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:12,992
WOMEN GIGGLING:

1590
01:35:13,163 --> 01:35:15,825
So I see you ladies
have met my understudy.

1591
01:35:15,999 --> 01:35:18,263
Hey, mitt me, kid.

1592
01:35:18,435 --> 01:35:22,599
Jeez, I thought I was gonna
forget the whole lyric, until I sang.

1593
01:35:22,772 --> 01:35:24,831
I just sang and the words came out.

1594
01:35:25,008 --> 01:35:28,171
I had no idea I still remembered them.

1595
01:35:29,045 --> 01:35:30,979
- Hey, come here.
- Yeah.

1596
01:35:31,148 --> 01:35:32,172
- Hi.
- Hi.

1597
01:35:32,349 --> 01:35:34,078
How you doing?

1598
01:35:35,018 --> 01:35:36,417
What's eating you, Fertilizer?

1599
01:35:36,586 --> 01:35:39,180
Evelyn's date? How about that guy?

1600
01:35:40,323 --> 01:35:42,848
Orson hasn't told you yet?

1601
01:35:43,026 --> 01:35:44,152
Told me what?

1602
01:35:44,861 --> 01:35:46,886
You're fired, Richard.

1603
01:35:47,664 --> 01:35:50,656
- I'm what?
- I'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you.

1604
01:35:50,834 --> 01:35:53,564
Orson's not only a son of a bitch,
he's a coward.

1605
01:35:54,404 --> 01:35:55,803
You're kidding me?

1606
01:35:55,972 --> 01:35:58,202
He never forgave you.

1607
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:00,104
He just wanted his opening night.

1608
01:36:00,744 --> 01:36:03,542
Joe, this isn't funny.

1609
01:36:03,713 --> 01:36:06,511
Did you see that blond kid
hanging around the stage tonight?

1610
01:36:06,683 --> 01:36:08,344
- Yeah.
- That's your replacement.

1611
01:36:11,321 --> 01:36:12,811
Okay.

1612
01:36:12,989 --> 01:36:14,388
What's the gag?

1613
01:36:14,558 --> 01:36:15,650
He's already been hired.

1614
01:36:15,825 --> 01:36:18,919
- Joe, stop kidding me.
- I'm not kidding.

1615
01:36:22,632 --> 01:36:24,031
No.

1616
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:25,964
No, it's not gonna end like this.

1617
01:36:26,136 --> 01:36:27,865
I mean, what the hell did I do?

1618
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:29,699
It's Orson. He can't be wrong.

1619
01:36:29,873 --> 01:36:31,636
I said one thing.

1620
01:36:31,808 --> 01:36:35,904
I said Sonja was my girlfriend.
I fought for her, like you told me to do.

1621
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:38,604
I told you to fight for her,
not fight Orson for her.

1622
01:36:39,049 --> 01:36:41,540
Besides, he said you took Leve's side.

1623
01:36:44,087 --> 01:36:45,782
Okay.

1624
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:48,653
Okay, so, what do I have to do?

1625
01:36:48,825 --> 01:36:51,055
I'm sorry, Richard.

1626
01:36:51,228 --> 01:36:52,456
Wait, wait.

1627
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:54,654
He gave me this.

1628
01:36:54,831 --> 01:36:56,560
Doesn't this mean anything?

1629
01:36:56,733 --> 01:36:59,861
He gave everyone
the same goddamn card.

1630
01:37:01,504 --> 01:37:04,598
Is he here? Is he here, Joe?

1631
01:37:04,774 --> 01:37:06,867
I'm going to talk to him.

1632
01:37:09,746 --> 01:37:11,976
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. How you doing, man?

1633
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:15,983
Get your coat. We're gonna be late.

1634
01:37:19,556 --> 01:37:20,580
Where is he?

1635
01:37:20,757 --> 01:37:22,554
He already left.

1636
01:37:22,726 --> 01:37:25,092
Everyone's going to the party.

1637
01:37:31,234 --> 01:37:32,826
That's a beautiful hat you got on.

1638
01:37:33,003 --> 01:37:34,732
It looks so pretty with your eyes.

1639
01:37:34,904 --> 01:37:37,202
Hey, Joe. Wait for me.

1640
01:37:37,374 --> 01:37:40,775
Richard, he's not gonna back
down tonight, I'm telling you.

1641
01:37:40,944 --> 01:37:43,777
He can't just dismiss people like this, Joe.
Don't I count?

1642
01:37:43,947 --> 01:37:45,812
I'll argue for you. That's all I can do.

1643
01:37:45,982 --> 01:37:49,110
If I was there, at the party,
in front of people, he would have to--

1644
01:37:49,286 --> 01:37:52,278
Welles is gonna back down
in front of the company with you there?

1645
01:37:52,455 --> 01:37:54,116
Is that what you're expecting?

1646
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:56,653
You go home, kid.

1647
01:37:59,462 --> 01:38:01,327
This is home.

1648
01:38:30,927 --> 01:38:32,394
I'm sorry, Richard.

1649
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:37,464
I gave it everything I had.
Orson's intractable.

1650
01:38:38,301 --> 01:38:39,325
SIGHS:

1651
01:38:39,502 --> 01:38:42,164
I'm so sorry. I tried to talk to him.

1652
01:38:42,339 --> 01:38:44,899
Joe Cotten tried to talk to him.
John tried.

1653
01:38:45,075 --> 01:38:49,011
- Are you going to the party?
- My date's picking me up soon.

1654
01:38:51,681 --> 01:38:53,945
Well, at least tell me it's not Welles.

1655
01:38:54,117 --> 01:38:56,813
No, it's not Orson.

1656
01:38:57,721 --> 01:38:59,382
It's David O. Selznick.

1657
01:39:01,491 --> 01:39:02,856
Well, I wish you luck.

1658
01:39:04,661 --> 01:39:06,993
I won't need luck.

1659
01:39:07,163 --> 01:39:09,461
I don't believe in luck.

1660
01:39:09,632 --> 01:39:11,896
I don't think I do any more, either.

1661
01:39:12,502 --> 01:39:14,766
It's kind of a relief, isn't it?

1662
01:39:15,372 --> 01:39:16,896
Not believing in luck.

1663
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:29,245
Well, I don't want to keep
Mr. Selznick waiting, do I?

1664
01:39:31,755 --> 01:39:33,484
How do I look?

1665
01:39:36,259 --> 01:39:40,423
Like a girl who's gonna give me
one blindingly beautiful parting kiss.

1666
01:40:06,489 --> 01:40:09,549
Plutarch writes, quote:

1667
01:40:09,726 --> 01:40:13,492
"He did not fear
such fat, luxurious men...

1668
01:40:13,663 --> 01:40:16,689
...but rather pale, lean fellows...

1669
01:40:16,866 --> 01:40:21,303
...meaning Cassius and Brutus," unquote.

1670
01:40:21,571 --> 01:40:26,907
Now, does this Plutarchian passage
parallel any important lines...

1671
01:40:27,076 --> 01:40:29,544
...in the text
we were discussing yesterday?

1672
01:40:30,713 --> 01:40:32,510
Mr. Samuels?

1673
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:36,817
Do you really expect
to find the answer out the window?

1674
01:40:40,323 --> 01:40:45,761
It parallels Caesar's speech
to Antony, which goes:

1675
01:40:45,929 --> 01:40:49,558
"Yond Cassius
has a lean and hungry look;

1676
01:40:49,732 --> 01:40:53,224
He thinks too much:
such men are dangerous."

1677
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,332
Excellent.

1678
01:40:55,505 --> 01:41:01,637
"He is a great observer and he looks
quite through the deeds of men:

1679
01:41:02,812 --> 01:41:06,043
He loves no plays, as thou dost, Antony;

1680
01:41:06,216 --> 01:41:08,684
He hears no music.

1681
01:41:09,919 --> 01:41:14,015
Seldom he smiles,
and smiles in such a sort

1682
01:41:14,190 --> 01:41:17,990
as if he mock'd himself,
and scorn'd his spirit

1683
01:41:18,161 --> 01:41:20,686
that could be moved
to smile at anything."

1684
01:41:21,297 --> 01:41:22,855
Very impressive.

1685
01:41:24,567 --> 01:41:26,626
"Such men as he be never at heart's ease

1686
01:41:26,803 --> 01:41:29,670
whiles they behold a greater
than themselves,

1687
01:41:29,839 --> 01:41:34,401
And therefore are they very dangerous."

1688
01:41:41,484 --> 01:41:43,179
Oh, Richard.

1689
01:43:08,037 --> 01:43:10,005
BIRD CHIRPING:

1690
01:43:20,283 --> 01:43:21,614
Richard.

1691
01:43:21,784 --> 01:43:23,411
That Grecian urn's still here, huh?

1692
01:43:23,586 --> 01:43:24,610
Yeah.

1693
01:43:24,787 --> 01:43:26,584
- Like the poem.
- Exactly.

1694
01:43:26,756 --> 01:43:29,816
Civil wars and plagues
and a thousand years...

1695
01:43:29,993 --> 01:43:32,860
...and still, this vase is around.

1696
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:34,954
What am I doing?

1697
01:43:35,131 --> 01:43:39,397
I'm acting like nothing special has happened
and the whole world has changed.

1698
01:43:39,569 --> 01:43:41,799
Here. Read this.

1699
01:43:43,973 --> 01:43:45,702
I was really hoping you'd come.

1700
01:43:48,111 --> 01:43:51,478
"Dear Miss Adler, we are pleased
to inform you that <i>Hungry Generations...</i>

1701
01:43:51,648 --> 01:43:54,412
...is a short story
we would very much like to publish.

1702
01:43:56,052 --> 01:43:59,180
It's funny, and true, and touching."

1703
01:44:00,623 --> 01:44:02,853
Congratulations.

1704
01:44:03,026 --> 01:44:04,789
Can you believe it?

1705
01:44:04,961 --> 01:44:07,191
<i>The New Yorker.</i>

1706
01:44:08,264 --> 01:44:10,095
Do you know what this means to me?

1707
01:44:10,266 --> 01:44:13,724
It's the first thing I've ever had
published and it's all because of you.

1708
01:44:13,903 --> 01:44:16,531
- No, no.
- Yeah, you gave it to that girl.

1709
01:44:16,706 --> 01:44:20,506
Do you think they would have read the thing
if it just came in over the transom?

1710
01:44:20,677 --> 01:44:22,542
Thanks, Richard.

1711
01:44:23,413 --> 01:44:25,313
- Maybe it was the vase.
- Oh, maybe.

1712
01:44:25,481 --> 01:44:29,281
Everything I write for the rest of my life
I'm coming here to rub on that vase.

1713
01:44:29,452 --> 01:44:32,353
Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?
Your play.

1714
01:44:32,522 --> 01:44:34,888
It's all anybody's talking about.

1715
01:44:35,058 --> 01:44:36,992
- Did you see the newspapers?
- Yeah.

1716
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:38,684
Yeah, well, of course you did.

1717
01:44:38,861 --> 01:44:41,591
- God, to think I was there opening night.
- Mm-hm.

1718
01:44:41,764 --> 01:44:43,356
It was great.

1719
01:44:43,533 --> 01:44:46,263
Your scene, at the end, where you sing...

1720
01:44:46,436 --> 01:44:47,528
...that was wonderful.

1721
01:44:48,071 --> 01:44:49,800
Thank you.

1722
01:44:50,807 --> 01:44:52,570
Listen...

1723
01:44:53,076 --> 01:44:57,376
...I wanna take you to lunch or dinner,
whatever the hell time it is now, okay?

1724
01:44:57,547 --> 01:44:59,913
- Okay.
- Okay.

1725
01:45:00,616 --> 01:45:02,914
A week ago, who would have believed it?

1726
01:45:03,086 --> 01:45:04,417
Here we are.

1727
01:45:04,587 --> 01:45:07,852
I'm a writer, you're an actor.

1728
01:45:09,459 --> 01:45:13,657
Actually, I don't know
if this play's gonna work out long-term.

1729
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:16,492
- Really?
- Yeah.

1730
01:45:16,666 --> 01:45:20,102
I'm kind of wondering
if I'm even cut out for the actor's life.

1731
01:45:20,269 --> 01:45:21,566
Oh.

1732
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:26,873
All I do know is that whatever it is...

1733
01:45:27,043 --> 01:45:31,946
...acting, writing, music, plays, I just...

1734
01:45:33,049 --> 01:45:34,641
...want to be a part of it all.

1735
01:45:34,817 --> 01:45:36,444
I know exactly what you mean.

1736
01:45:45,862 --> 01:45:49,696
You know, the last time we were here...

1737
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,832
...I was thinking to myself, "Gretta,
you've been living in the city half a year...

1738
01:45:55,004 --> 01:45:58,735
...trying to write,
hoping to meet people."

1739
01:45:59,475 --> 01:46:01,875
Here I meet a guy I like.

1740
01:46:02,311 --> 01:46:07,112
Don't worry, I'm not trying to scare you.

1741
01:46:07,283 --> 01:46:11,617
Just seems like we have
so many of the same interests.

1742
01:46:11,788 --> 01:46:13,380
Yeah.

1743
01:46:13,556 --> 01:46:17,617
It's an exciting time,
because it feels like--

1744
01:46:17,794 --> 01:46:19,659
Like it's all ahead of us.

1745
01:46:19,829 --> 01:46:20,955
Yeah.

1746
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:23,223
Hold the doors.

1747
01:46:28,471 --> 01:46:30,098
Yeah.

1748
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:32,633
It's all ahead of us.

1749
01:46:33,342 --> 01:46:35,333
What do you think?

1750
01:46:36,412 --> 01:46:37,606
Hm....

1751
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,906
GRETTA LAUGHS:

1752
01:46:39,081 --> 01:46:40,810
Possibilities.

1753
01:46:40,983 --> 01:46:44,316
Yeah. Possibilities.
