2
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:47,206
A Terrorist Arms Bazaar
on the Russian Border

3
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,271
Our man's in position
on the center camera.

4
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,436
It's like a terrorist supermarket.

5
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:23,949
Chinese Long March Scud,
Panther AS-565 attack helicopter...

6
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:27,076
a pair of Russian mortars, and
the crates look like American rifles.

7
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,287
Chilean mines, German explosives.
Fun for the whole family.

8
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,189
I.D.s.

9
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,820
White Rook to White Knight.
Show us the pawns.

10
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:40,662
You see, he did get through, Admiral.
Start with that chap in the middle.

11
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,928
Load the I.D. Program, please.

12
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,936
Data base I.D. Search.

13
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,938
Checking the databases.

14
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,975
We've got out first match.
Satoshi Isagura.

15
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,670
Chemical expert.
Wanted for the Tokyo subway attack.

16
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,714
Currently working for
the insurgent force in Zaire.

17
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,943
Henry Gupta. American.

18
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,749
Practically invented techno-terrorism.

19
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:05,689
Started out as a student radical
at Berkeley in the '60s.

20
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,692
Now he sells his politics for cash.

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,161
- Zoom in on that, can you?
- That looks like an American encoder.

22
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,495
They use it to control their navigation
satellites: The G.P.S. System.

23
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:18,333
I wonder, will the C.I.A. Be more upset
that they lost it or that we found it?

24
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,305
Excuse me. Admiral?

25
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:26,141
Thank you, M, we've seen enough.
This is now a military operation.

26
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,043
You saw the Gatling gun?

27
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,514
Are your troops prepared
for that kind of firepower?

28
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,848
We have election
in Moscow next week.

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,754
The president said any loss
of life is unacceptable.

30
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,485
We'll take the naval option.

31
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,722
In one strike, we take out
half the world's terrorists.

32
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,322
- Admiral Roebuck, I must protest.
- Get me the Chester.

33
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,890
- Best not waste time.
- My man isn't finished.

34
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,404
Black King to White Bishop.
Authorization to fire.

35
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,073
Get your man out of there.
His job is over.

36
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,378
Weapons authorized.
Prepare to fire.

37
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,736
On my count.
Five, four, three, two, one.

38
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,666
Missile away.

39
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,371
Time to target:
Four minutes, eight seconds.

40
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:18,211
White Knight, four minutes to impact.
Get out of there.

41
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:22,007
Yes, damn it, I know what it is!
It's on the screen in front of me.

42
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,815
It's a jeep in front of a plane.

43
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,879
Now, get the hell out of there!

44
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,618
- What the hell's going on?
- You will not wait!

45
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:32,354
- That's an order!
- What is your man waiting for?

46
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:35,397
White Knight?
Oh, my God!

47
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,865
Those are Soviet SB-5
nuclear torpedoes.

48
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:43,032
- If the Cruise hits them...
- Order them to abort the missile.

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,141
- H.M.S. Chester urgent.
- White Knight, come in.

50
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,373
Abort missile.
Abort missile.

51
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:52,539
- Abort missile.
- Abort missile.

52
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,384
Captain, sir,
missile out of range.

53
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:59,216
Unable to destroy.

54
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:07,225
- White Knight...
- Alert NATO, the Pentagon.

55
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:09,891
- Will it trigger the torpedoes?
- It might.

56
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:12,764
But even if it does not,
there's enough plutonium...

57
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,736
to make Chernobyl
look like picnic.

58
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:19,036
Bloody hell! Can't you people
keep anything locked up?

59
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,928
Evacuate your troops,
and get him out of there, now!

60
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,155
White Knight, come in.
White Knight, come in!

61
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,631
- Keep trying, damn it!
- White Knight, come in.

62
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,023
Repeat, White Knight, come in.

63
00:04:44,766 --> 00:04:46,358
Filthy habit.

64
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:02,447
I've got the encoder.

65
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:13,093
- What the hell is he doing?
- His job.

66
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:21,632
He's going for the bombs.

67
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,451
Get that jeep!

68
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:51,089
Get out of it, James.

69
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:23,190
One minute to impact.

70
00:07:14,415 --> 00:07:15,939
Thirty seconds to impact.

71
00:09:10,031 --> 00:09:11,498
Backseat driver.

72
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:16,326
White Knight to White Rook.

73
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:18,872
I've evacuated the area.

74
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:21,806
Ask the admiral where
he'd like his bombs delivered.

75
00:09:51,622 --> 00:09:53,681
Darling, I'm killed

76
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,088
I'm in a puddle on the floor

77
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:02,064
Waiting for you

78
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,100
To return

79
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:07,136
Oh, what a thrill

80
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:12,034
Fascinations galore

81
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:13,974
How you tease

82
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:17,343
How you leave me to burn

83
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:24,448
It's so deadly, my dear

84
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:31,225
The power of having you near

85
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,356
Until that day

86
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:42,872
Until the world falls away

87
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:47,437
Until you say

88
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:51,311
There'll be no more good-byes

89
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:57,649
I see it in your eyes

90
00:10:57,721 --> 00:11:02,385
Tomorrow never dies

91
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:12,435
Darling, you've won
It's no fun

92
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:15,836
Martinis, girls and guns

93
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:20,570
It's murder on our love affair

94
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:26,008
But you bet your life
every night

95
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,450
While you're chasing
the morning light

96
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,717
You're not the only spy

97
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:35,087
Out there

98
00:11:37,628 --> 00:11:41,291
It's so deadly, my dear

99
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:48,160
The power of wanting you near

100
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:52,800
Until that day

101
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:59,881
Until the world falls away

102
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:08,453
Until you say there'll be
no more good-byes

103
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:14,626
I see it in your eyes

104
00:12:14,698 --> 00:12:19,635
Tomorrow never dies

105
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,348
Sound the general alarm.

106
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:49,331
The ship has been overflown
by two Chinese MiGs.

107
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,335
We believe they have hostile intent.

108
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:55,167
Hands to action stations.

109
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:02,709
H.M.S. Devonshire.
This is your last warning.

110
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,714
You are in Chinese
territorial waters.

111
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:12,483
Officer of the Watch, maximum speed.
Come left 40 degrees.

112
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:16,458
Aye, aye, sir.
Revolutions 1-6-0, port 20.

113
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,154
Are they insane?

114
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:25,332
The Chinese pilot insists that
we are only 11 miles off their coast...

115
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:28,929
and he will fire if we don't
turn around and go to a Chinese port.

116
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:31,668
Send this:
"We are in international waters...

117
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:33,676
and will defend ourselves
if attacked. "

118
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:36,178
Copy all this
to the Admiralty, urgent.

119
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:40,314
Are we absolutely sure
of our position?

120
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:44,478
Yes, sir.
An exact satellite fix.

121
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,186
Carver Media Group Network - Hamburg

122
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,868
Captain, we are ready to launch.

123
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,874
Shut down the engines.

124
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,103
Maintain full silence.

125
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:27,635
A stealth ship may be invisible
to radar but the Seadrill isn't.

126
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:35,130
We'll launch next time
the MiGs fly by...

127
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:38,368
and the British will think
it's a Chinese aerial torpedo.

128
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,568
I should report in.

129
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:48,949
Stamper to Hamburg.
Phase one is in progress.

130
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:51,851
I'll report back to you
with an update.

131
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:01,797
- The MiGs are making another pass.
- Let's start the show.

132
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:03,799
Seadrill in position.

133
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:17,318
Start the drill.

134
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,037
- Release it.
- Seadrill away.

135
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:36,942
Green 3-0,
torpedo, torpedo, torpedo.

136
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:38,949
Center bearing 1-1-4.

137
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:40,951
Officer of the Watch,
come hard right, 1-4-1.

138
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:43,681
There's been no sonar contact, sir.
The MiGs must have dropped it.

139
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:49,856
Bearing steady.
It's gonna hit, sir.

140
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:52,123
Brace, brace, brace.

141
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:02,367
- Target: 1200.
- Knock knock.

142
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,619
Let's go upstairs.

143
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:34,799
- Turn left.
- Rotating 90 degrees.

144
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:50,416
Now they're wondering why
the torpedo hasn't exploded.

145
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:52,787
PWO, Captain.
Full damage report.

146
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,420
Backup power, immediately!

147
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,365
Switch to alternate supply.

148
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:05,926
Three generators are down, sir.
Flooding on four deck aft.

149
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:10,037
Sir, we're now down
14 degrees by the stern.

150
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:14,545
Yeoman, send to Admiralty: "Have been
torpedoed by Chinese MiGs. Sinking. "

151
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:18,879
Give them our position.
Right. Abandon ship.

152
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,511
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

153
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:29,223
Everyone on deck! Come on!

154
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:41,134
One missile at the MiGs.

155
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:56,845
Maintaining radio silence.

156
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:05,979
Their last broadcast, sir.

157
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:10,616
Mr. Gupta's little trick
with the encoder worked.

158
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:13,813
They gave their final position
70 miles from here.

159
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:16,288
The British Navy
will never find them.

160
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,351
Survivors in the water.

161
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:40,211
Mr. Stamper,
I'm having fun with my headlines.

162
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:43,114
I need to know
the exact number of survivors.

163
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:46,984
Now, I'm late for a meeting. Make sure
you use the right kind of ammunition.

164
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:48,646
Yes, sir.

165
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,518
Delicious.

166
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:23,420
Start the recovery operation.

167
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:25,686
Send our divers
down to the Devonshire.

168
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,911
Mr. Gupta?
Phase one is complete.

169
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:06,023
Good morning, my golden retrievers.

170
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,434
What kind of havoc shall the Carver
Media Group create in the world today?

171
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:13,632
- News.
- Floods in Pakistan, riots in Paris.

172
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:16,972
- And a plane crash in California.
- Excellent.

173
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:21,071
Mr. Jones, are we ready
to release our new software?

174
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:24,584
Yes, sir.
As requested, it's full of bugs...

175
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:27,177
which means people will be
forced to upgrade for years.

176
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:28,380
Outstanding.

177
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:31,618
Mr. Wallace, call the president.

178
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:35,093
Tell him if he doesn't sign the bill
lowering the cable rates...

179
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:37,130
we'll release a video of him
with the cheerleader...

180
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:40,133
- in the Chicago motel room.
- Inspired, sir.

181
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,635
After he signs the bill,
release the tape anyway.

182
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:44,330
Consider him slimed.

183
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,066
Excuse me.

184
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:50,269
- He's on transponder seven.
- Mr. Stamper?

185
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:55,613
Phase two is underway.
I have the videotape.

186
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:59,642
I haven't seen it myself,
but I'm told the footage is excellent.

187
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,554
Plus, there were 17 survivors
for your headlines.

188
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:05,353
Good work, Stamper.

189
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:09,526
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

190
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:12,464
Make sure you keep it
in a safe place.

191
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:15,695
Gentlemen and ladies...

192
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:18,329
hold the presses.

193
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:20,339
This just in.

194
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:24,867
By a curious quirk of fate,
we have the perfect story...

195
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:28,642
with which to launch our
Satellite News Network tonight.

196
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:34,154
It seems a small crisis is brewing
in the South China Sea.

197
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:37,850
I want full newspaper coverage.
I want magazine stories.

198
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:41,793
I want books. I want films.
I want TV. I want radio.

199
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:44,695
I want us on the air
24 hours a day.

200
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:46,699
This is our moment!

201
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:50,660
And a billion people
around this planet...

202
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:53,298
will watch it, hear it...

203
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:57,208
and read about it
from the Carver Media Group.

204
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:03,572
There's no news like bad news.

205
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:17,526
I am pleased with your progress,
Mr. Bond.

206
00:22:17,598 --> 00:22:23,969
I've always enjoyed studying
a new tongue, Professor.

207
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:28,998
One might say
you have a natural ability.

208
00:22:29,076 --> 00:22:32,773
But practice makes perfect.

209
00:22:42,256 --> 00:22:45,453
How do you say
"I'm not here" in Danish?

210
00:22:45,526 --> 00:22:47,084
Just ignore it.

211
00:22:47,161 --> 00:22:51,359
Those are words they just
don't have in their vocabulary.

212
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:57,197
- Bond here.
- Go to a secure line, 007.

213
00:22:57,271 --> 00:23:00,729
Going to a scrambler,
channel four.

214
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:04,208
That's ridiculous.
That ship was in international waters.

215
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:08,612
- We can't be certain.
- James? Where are you?

216
00:23:08,682 --> 00:23:10,616
Oh, Moneypenny.

217
00:23:12,252 --> 00:23:16,120
I'm just up here at Oxford
brushing up on a little Danish.

218
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,589
Little?

219
00:23:17,658 --> 00:23:20,252
I'm afraid you're going to have
to kiss off your lesson, James.

220
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:22,955
We've got a situation here
at the Ministry of Defense.

221
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,055
We're sending the fleet to China.

222
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:30,125
I'll be there in an hour.

223
00:23:30,204 --> 00:23:31,831
Make that 30 minutes.

224
00:23:33,173 --> 00:23:35,334
Good-bye, my sweet.

225
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,644
You always were
a cunning linguist, James.

226
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,579
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.

227
00:23:56,897 --> 00:24:00,560
That's preposterous. We know exactly
where that ship was positioned.

228
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:04,001
The G.P.S. System... Global
Positioning Satellites... do not lie.

229
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:08,007
Yes, but our Singapore station
picked up a mysterious signal...

230
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:10,168
on the G.P.S. Frequency
at the time of the attack.

231
00:24:10,244 --> 00:24:12,178
It could've sent that ship
off course.

232
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:15,238
- I have a missing British frigate...
- I'm aware of that!

233
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:17,681
And instead of decisive action,
all you want to do is investigate.

234
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,117
My goal is to prevent World War Three,
Admiral, and I don't think...

235
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:23,213
sending an armada into the recovery
area is the best way to do it.

236
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,555
Where, exactly, did this mysterious
G.P.S. Signal come from?

237
00:24:26,627 --> 00:24:29,562
- We're still investigating.
- "Investigating. "

238
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,327
M, sometimes I don't think
you have the balls for this job.

239
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,766
Perhaps, but the advantage is...

240
00:24:35,836 --> 00:24:37,963
I don't have to think
with them all the time.

241
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:41,806
That's enough.
Now, where do we stand?

242
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:47,004
It was an unprovoked attack
on a ship in international waters.

243
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,709
We send in the fleet for recovery
and prepare for full retaliation.

244
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:53,150
Moderation.
We investigate...

245
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,450
and stop short of sending
the entire British Navy...

246
00:24:55,522 --> 00:24:57,717
within ten minutes
of the world's largest air force.

247
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:00,851
- When will our ships be in position?
- Forty-eight hours.

248
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,055
Christ!

249
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,064
The press are already
screaming for blood.

250
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:08,192
The last thing we want to do
is escalate the situation.

251
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:10,202
I'm afraid it may be too late
to worry about that.

252
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,068
Seventeen British sailors murdered!

253
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,706
"According to Vietnamese officials
who recovered the bodies...

254
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,510
the victims were riddled
with the same ammunition...

255
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:23,845
used by the Chinese Air Force. "

256
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:26,579
- Did you leak this?
- No.

257
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:31,280
- It's the first I've heard of it.
- Well, this settles it.

258
00:25:32,526 --> 00:25:34,721
We send in the fleet.

259
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:38,196
M, you have 48 hours to investigate.

260
00:25:46,473 --> 00:25:48,407
There is one strange thing.

261
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:51,103
When I called our contact
in Saigon, he said the Vietnamese...

262
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:53,408
only found our sailors
three hours ago.

263
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,107
How'd they get the paper out so fast?

264
00:25:55,182 --> 00:25:58,811
Somebody at Tomorrow knew
before the Vietnamese government did.

265
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:02,652
How much do you know
about Elliot Carver, 007?

266
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,122
Worldwide media baron.

267
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,955
Able to topple governments
with a single broadcast.

268
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:09,757
Carver owns that newspaper Tomorrow.

269
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,060
I didn't want to discuss it
in front of the minister...

270
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:15,101
but that mysterious signal came
from one of Carver's satellites.

271
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:20,164
The P.M. Would have my head
if he knew you were investigating him.

272
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,232
I'm sending you to Hamburg, 007.
We've arranged for you to be invited...

273
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,403
to a party
at Carver's Media Center.

274
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:27,879
They're celebrating the launch
of a new satellite...

275
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:31,645
because now he has the ability to reach
every human being on the Earth.

276
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:34,846
Except the Chinese,
who have refused broadcast rights.

277
00:26:37,257 --> 00:26:40,920
Your ticket, cover story
and rental car reservation.

278
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:42,655
Sign here, please.

279
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:46,495
I believe you once had a relationship
with Carver's wife, Paris.

280
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:49,766
That was a long time ago, M...

281
00:26:49,836 --> 00:26:51,770
before she was married.

282
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:56,167
I didn't realize
it was public knowledge.

283
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:58,268
Queen and country, James.

284
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:01,212
Your job is to find out whether Carver
or someone in his organization...

285
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:03,442
sent that ship off course
and why.

286
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:06,509
Use your relationship
with Mrs. Carver if necessary.

287
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:08,885
I doubt if she'll remember me.

288
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:10,821
Remind her.

289
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,393
Then pump her for information.

290
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:18,856
You'll just have to decide
how much pumping is needed, James.

291
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,298
If only that were true
of you and I, Moneypenny.

292
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:02,901
If you'll just sign here,
Mr. Bond.

293
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:09,577
It's the insurance damage waiver...

294
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:12,617
for your beautiful new car.

295
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:16,348
- Will you need collision coverage?
- Yes.

296
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:17,855
Fire?

297
00:28:17,923 --> 00:28:20,118
Probably.

298
00:28:20,192 --> 00:28:22,922
- Property destruction?
- Definitely.

299
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:24,690
Personal injury?

300
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:27,095
I hope not, but accidents do happen.

301
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,293
They frequently do with you.

302
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:34,569
Well, that takes care
of the normal wear and tear.

303
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,574
Do I need any other protection?

304
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:41,879
Only from me, 007, unless you bring
that car back in pristine order.

305
00:28:41,947 --> 00:28:44,279
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

306
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:50,286
Your new BMW 750.

307
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:54,156
All the usual refinements...
machine guns, rockets...

308
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:56,456
the G.P.S. Tracking system.

309
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,964
Welcome. Please fasten seat belt and
obey all instructions for a safe trip.

310
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,798
I thought you'd pay more attention
to a female voice.

311
00:29:05,771 --> 00:29:08,103
- I think we've met.
- I am not interested...

312
00:29:08,173 --> 00:29:10,164
in your sordid escapades.

313
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:12,142
Let's get on with it, shall we?

314
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,145
Your new telephone.

315
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:16,977
Talk here, listen here.

316
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:19,574
So that's what I've been
doing wrong all these years.

317
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:24,644
It also includes
a fingerprint scanner...

318
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,658
and a 20,000-volt
security system.

319
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:30,752
And this I'm particularly proud of...

320
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:33,696
the remote control for your car.

321
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:35,461
Tap twice.

322
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:37,195
One, two.

323
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:41,004
Now, draw your finger...

324
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:43,633
very slowly across the pad...

325
00:29:44,777 --> 00:29:46,711
to drive the car.

326
00:29:51,517 --> 00:29:55,146
It's surprisingly difficult to drive,
but with practice...

327
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,678
Well, let's see how she responds
to my touch, eh, Q?

328
00:30:23,315 --> 00:30:25,249
I think we understand each other.

329
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:28,150
Grow up, 007.

330
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:47,830
Attention. Engine running.
Please shut door now.

331
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:49,840
Don't let her push you around.

332
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:04,619
Anyway, there's absolutely no truth
in this malicious rumor...

333
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,250
that I started running
Mad Cow Disease stories...

334
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:11,194
simply because Sir Angus Black,
the great British beef baron...

335
00:31:11,263 --> 00:31:14,892
lost 10,000 pounds to me in a game
of poker and refused to pay up.

336
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:18,694
Moreover, there's even
less truth in the rumor...

337
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:20,739
that I took 100 million francs
from the French...

338
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:23,070
to keep the stories running
for another year.

339
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:25,906
- Excuse me, Mr. Carver.
- Yes.

340
00:31:25,978 --> 00:31:28,845
This is the new banker, Mr...

341
00:31:28,914 --> 00:31:31,815
Bond. James Bond.

342
00:31:31,884 --> 00:31:34,944
Another new banker.
I seem to collect them.

343
00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:38,218
Tell me, Mr. Bond.

344
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,781
How's the market reacting
to the crisis?

345
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:43,919
Well, currencies are off.
Your stock is soaring.

346
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:47,265
I don't believe we have met.

347
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,430
- Elliot Carver.
- Wai Lin.

348
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:52,629
I'm from the New China News Agency.

349
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:54,798
I don't recall seeing your name
on the guest list.

350
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,500
I have a confession.

351
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:59,976
It's not. I snuck in.

352
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,605
Why would you do that, my dear?

353
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,615
I wanted to meet you.

354
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:06,617
Outstanding.

355
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:09,586
I admire a woman
who takes the initiative.

356
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:13,113
- You should work in my Beijing bureau.
- Mr. Carver.

357
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:16,821
- You don't have a bureau in Beijing.
- Call me Elliot.

358
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:31,465
I always wondered how I'd feel
if I ever saw you again.

359
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:42,811
Now I know.

360
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:45,550
Was it something I said?

361
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:48,184
How about the words,
"I'll be right back?"

362
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:54,630
- Something came up.
- Something always came up.

363
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,727
- And how are you, Paris?
- Much better now. We're even.

364
00:32:58,804 --> 00:33:00,738
Something to drink, Mrs. Carver?

365
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:04,674
Mr. Bond will have a vodka martini,
shaken not stirred.

366
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:08,042
Mrs. Carver will have a tequila,
straight shot.

367
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:12,812
No, Mrs. Carver will have a glass
of Mr. Carver's champagne.

368
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,613
I see you've moved up
in the world, Paris.

369
00:33:16,688 --> 00:33:19,623
And tonight, you're a banker.
I saw the guest list.

370
00:33:21,226 --> 00:33:24,252
Tell me, James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

371
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,970
- To you.
- No, to the gun.

372
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:48,115
So I take it
this isn't a social visit?

373
00:33:48,187 --> 00:33:50,212
Your husband may be in trouble.

374
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:52,723
The emperor of the air.

375
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:55,351
If you think you're going after him,
you're the one who's in trouble.

376
00:33:55,427 --> 00:33:59,158
Perhaps, but it's either him
or someone in his organization.

377
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:02,564
I see. And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.

378
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:05,432
No. That wasn't my plan.

379
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:07,938
Good. Because if it
comes to a choice...

380
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:10,406
between you and Elliot,
I've made my bed.

381
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:12,739
You don't sleep in it anymore.

382
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:14,403
There you are.

383
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,406
Darling.

384
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:23,055
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

385
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:26,453
I want you to meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.

386
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:29,289
- Hello, Mrs. Carver.
- It's a pleasure.

387
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,829
And this is James Bond.

388
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:34,491
I didn't realize
you knew each other.

389
00:34:34,566 --> 00:34:36,466
- We're old friends.
- Casual acquaintances.

390
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:38,901
He dated my roommate in Zurich.

391
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:44,272
I'm thinking of getting Wai Lin
behind a news desk.

392
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:46,776
That's wonderful.
I'm sure she won't resist...

393
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:48,802
too much.

394
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:53,751
Tell me, Elliot, I was just
wondering about your satellites...

395
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:56,310
the way you've positioned
yourself globally.

396
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:59,414
They're merely tools
for information, Mr. Bond.

397
00:34:59,491 --> 00:35:01,083
Or disinformation.

398
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:05,528
Say, if you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments or people.

399
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:07,588
Or even a ship.

400
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:12,503
That's very interesting, Mr. Bond.

401
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:16,268
You have a vivid imagination
for a banker.

402
00:35:16,341 --> 00:35:18,809
Perhaps I should commission you
to write a novel.

403
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:22,813
Oh, heavens, no.
I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.

404
00:35:30,188 --> 00:35:33,419
It's time to begin the festivities.

405
00:35:33,492 --> 00:35:35,050
Excuse me. Darling?

406
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:42,192
So, how do you really know him?

407
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:45,293
I told you, he's a banker.
I met him in Zurich.

408
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,497
You're a terrible liar, dear.

409
00:35:50,308 --> 00:35:53,641
I have a problem with a banker.

410
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:56,442
Could I see you a moment?

411
00:35:56,515 --> 00:35:59,109
Ladies and gentlemen.

412
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:05,346
Mr. Carver's broadcast will be starting
in ten minutes in the main studio.

413
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:11,417
Exactly what kind of banking
do you specialize in, Mr. Bond?

414
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:16,991
Hostile takeovers.
Shall we?

415
00:36:26,912 --> 00:36:29,813
Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.

416
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:32,349
It's nice to talk to the world.

417
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:37,722
Looks like there's someone
who wants to talk to you.

418
00:36:40,425 --> 00:36:42,893
Mr. Bond, you have
an urgent phone call.

419
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:51,627
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in five...

420
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:56,273
four, three, two...

421
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:58,275
Good evening.

422
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:02,074
Tonight's broadcast was supposed
to be a celebration...

423
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:05,913
marking the completion of
the Carver Global Satellite Network.

424
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:08,509
But, as you're well aware...

425
00:37:08,587 --> 00:37:11,681
a terrible conflict looms tonight
in the South China Sea...

426
00:37:11,756 --> 00:37:13,451
which, unchecked...

427
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:19,259
has the potential to destroy
every human being on Earth.

428
00:37:19,331 --> 00:37:22,926
- I want to assure my viewers that I...
- This way, please.

429
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:26,368
Elliot Carver, have spoken
with the prime minister in London...

430
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:28,406
and the chairman in Beijing...

431
00:37:28,473 --> 00:37:31,101
and have offered my services
as an impartial...

432
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:37,607
It's a soundproof room, Mr. Bond.
Nobody hears you scream.

433
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:45,846
Herr Stamper, we have made contact.

434
00:37:45,924 --> 00:37:48,449
Make him uncomfortable.

435
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:50,824
I'll be there in a few moments.

436
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:54,296
...with its printing presses
that run 24 hours a day...

437
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:57,597
and its satellite facilities
linking every last...

438
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,700
You seem very concerned
about Mr. Carver's business.

439
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:09,210
He wants to know why.

440
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:12,614
Why did I do it, you ask.

441
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:14,982
The answer is simple: Power.

442
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:18,853
The power to illuminate
the far corners of the globe.

443
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:20,857
Not for higher profits...

444
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:25,385
but for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet.

445
00:38:25,463 --> 00:38:28,227
Put him in the chair. Maybe we play
a little number on his head.

446
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,031
And what do I expect in return?

447
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:40,805
Worldwide domination.

448
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:45,043
Complete, utter, total
worldwide domination.

449
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:48,347
But not over governments
or ideology.

450
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,880
Over tyranny and isolation
and ignorance.

451
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:57,153
The Carver Media Group Network
has the ability...

452
00:38:57,228 --> 00:39:01,324
to reach every person
in every village in every nation.

453
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:03,390
But do not fear me...

454
00:39:03,468 --> 00:39:06,028
for tonight I offer you
my declaration of principles:

455
00:39:06,104 --> 00:39:09,369
A promise to the men and women
of this planet...

456
00:39:09,441 --> 00:39:12,740
my brothers and sisters
whom I so humbly serve.

457
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:18,113
I promise to report the news
without fear or favor.

458
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:21,710
I promise to be a force
for good in this world...

459
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:25,381
fighting injustice,
crushing intolerance...

460
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:26,719
battling inhumanity.

461
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,555
It's time for...

462
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,756
a station break.

463
00:39:37,202 --> 00:39:39,136
- What's happening?
- We've lost power.

464
00:39:39,204 --> 00:39:41,399
- We're off the air.
- What?

465
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:52,305
Ladies and gentlemen, please stay calm.
There's no need to go for the exit.

466
00:39:52,384 --> 00:39:54,750
We will go on in a few minutes' time.

467
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:58,380
What do you mean, you don't know?
You're fired! Get out of my sight!

468
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:47,304
And, in a rather embarrassing note...

469
00:40:47,372 --> 00:40:51,035
scrappy media mogul Elliot Carver
was cut off the air tonight...

470
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:53,543
in mid-speech during
the inaugural broadcast...

471
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:56,512
of his Worldwide Satellite Network.

472
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:59,209
Sorry, Elliot,
but we didn't do it.

473
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:03,887
Glorious evening, wasn't it?

474
00:41:03,955 --> 00:41:06,219
Come on, Elliot.
Ignore those people.

475
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,987
- Sometimes these things happen.
- Not to me.

476
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,994
Not to me!

477
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:25,006
When I was 16, I went to work
for a newspaper in Hong Kong.

478
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:30,912
It was a rag, but the editor
taught me one important lesson.

479
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:34,110
The key to a great story
is not who...

480
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:36,449
or what or when...

481
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:39,579
but why.

482
00:41:40,758 --> 00:41:45,092
Your friend, Mr. Bond,
made a mess tonight.

483
00:41:46,264 --> 00:41:50,257
- I want to know why.
- I told you, I barely know him.

484
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,760
Barely?

485
00:42:21,132 --> 00:42:24,397
I was curious
who Carver would send.

486
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,031
He's on to you.

487
00:42:28,373 --> 00:42:31,570
Well, we know where you stand.

488
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:34,406
You made your bed.

489
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,808
I'm standing in your doorway.

490
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,054
Then turn around and go home.

491
00:42:46,124 --> 00:42:48,285
You can tell him you didn't
get anything out of me.

492
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:54,092
That's it? Go home?

493
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:58,464
I didn't ask you
to get involved in this.

494
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,936
It's too late for that.

495
00:43:09,313 --> 00:43:11,247
Why did you marry him?

496
00:43:11,315 --> 00:43:14,250
He told me he loved me.

497
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:16,786
That always sounds good.

498
00:43:18,156 --> 00:43:22,115
Do you know I used to look in
the papers every day for your obituary?

499
00:43:24,162 --> 00:43:26,130
Well, I'm sorry
I keep disappointing you.

500
00:43:32,537 --> 00:43:34,471
What was it, James?

501
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:40,408
Did I get too close?

502
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:47,551
Did I get too close for comfort?

503
00:43:59,864 --> 00:44:01,354
Yes.

504
00:44:49,046 --> 00:44:50,980
I missed you.

505
00:44:57,555 --> 00:44:59,420
What did you find?

506
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:03,790
I hacked into the mainframe at the bank.
They're using an SSL2 encryption...

507
00:45:03,861 --> 00:45:07,194
Spare me the technobabble, please.

508
00:45:07,265 --> 00:45:09,859
Bond's got a perfect
employment record. Ten years.

509
00:45:09,934 --> 00:45:12,402
He's crossed every "T,"
he's dotted every "I."

510
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,631
- Which means?
- Government agent.

511
00:45:14,705 --> 00:45:17,640
I call it
Gupta's Law of Creative Anomalies.

512
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:20,643
If it sounds too good to be true,
it always is.

513
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:24,272
Do you think my wife knows?

514
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:31,047
There's a lot of garbage, but
if you dial down the ambient noise...

515
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,449
Tell me, James, do you still
sleep with a gun under your pillow?

516
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:40,495
Play it again.

517
00:45:40,565 --> 00:45:44,399
Tell me, James, do you still
sleep with a gun under your pillow?

518
00:45:46,337 --> 00:45:49,932
I think we should set an appointment
for my wife with the doctor.

519
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:11,091
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.

520
00:46:11,162 --> 00:46:13,392
I can get you out of the country
in four hours.

521
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:15,329
I have no choice.

522
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:18,835
No one can protect me
from him, not even you.

523
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:22,771
- You do have a choice.
- Only if you let him go.

524
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,774
I can't do that.

525
00:46:27,845 --> 00:46:31,246
He has a secret lab on the top floor
even I'm not supposed to know about.

526
00:46:31,315 --> 00:46:33,249
There's an emergency hatch
on the roof.

527
00:46:33,317 --> 00:46:35,547
- You don't have to do this.
- It's the easiest way to get in.

528
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,554
Don't argue with me, James.

529
00:46:39,523 --> 00:46:41,457
You know...

530
00:46:42,893 --> 00:46:44,827
this job of yours...

531
00:46:47,732 --> 00:46:50,166
it's murder on relationships.

532
00:48:10,881 --> 00:48:12,815
Until I get back next week,
I want two guards...

533
00:48:12,883 --> 00:48:16,250
outside this office
24 hours a day.

534
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,185
Nobody gets in. Got it?

535
00:48:18,255 --> 00:48:20,382
We'll take care of it.

536
00:48:23,494 --> 00:48:25,553
What do we do with the satellite?

537
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:30,496
Send this thing off to the launch site.
And be careful.

538
00:48:30,568 --> 00:48:34,800
It's worth 300 million dollars.
You break it, you bought it. Understand?

539
00:48:34,872 --> 00:48:37,466
I hate travelling.
I never know what to pack.

540
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:19,334
Looking for a news story?

541
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,866
They'll print anything these days.

542
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:35,734
Yes?

543
00:53:35,807 --> 00:53:39,743
Good morning, Mr. Bond.
Elliot Carver.

544
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:43,110
I believe you've got
two items that belong to me.

545
00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:45,206
What are you talking about?

546
00:53:45,283 --> 00:53:48,252
The red box, Mr. Bond...

547
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,152
and my wife in your hotel room.

548
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:05,498
He's coming.

549
00:54:10,475 --> 00:54:12,841
Fingerprint I.D. Accepted.

550
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:22,410
Please select security system level.

551
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,944
Tell me if you find the encoder.

552
00:54:48,012 --> 00:54:50,071
- Call me immediately.
- Yeah.

553
00:55:03,494 --> 00:55:05,621
And in breaking news...

554
00:55:05,697 --> 00:55:10,725
it is with great sadness that we
announce the death of Paris Carver...

555
00:55:10,802 --> 00:55:13,430
who has become an international figure
since she became the wife...

556
00:55:13,504 --> 00:55:15,802
of Elliot Carver,
chairman of this network.

557
00:55:17,141 --> 00:55:20,042
According to police officials
in Hamburg, Germany...

558
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:22,045
Mrs. Carver was found dead
this morning...

559
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:26,573
in a hotel suite in that city
in unusual circumstances...

560
00:55:26,651 --> 00:55:29,245
on which police
have refused to elaborate.

561
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,050
A coroner has been called for
and is expected to deliver...

562
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:35,524
his full report within
the next three days.

563
00:55:35,593 --> 00:55:39,324
Her body was discovered along with
the body of an unidentified man...

564
00:55:39,397 --> 00:55:42,560
who appeared to be the victim
of a self-inflicted gun wound.

565
00:55:42,633 --> 00:55:44,931
Reached aboard his private jet
en route...

566
00:55:45,003 --> 00:55:48,029
I have a clear shot at your head,
Mr. Bond.

567
00:55:48,106 --> 00:55:52,042
Stand up, slowly.

568
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,601
Drop your gun and
kick it toward me, ja?

569
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:57,113
At present, police
have refused to speculate...

570
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:59,513
on a motive in this
murder/suicide.

571
00:55:59,584 --> 00:56:01,415
Good. Now...

572
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:04,182
lie down on the bed
next to Mrs. Carver.

573
00:56:04,255 --> 00:56:07,156
We extend our deepest sympathies
to Mr. Carver.

574
00:56:10,094 --> 00:56:12,722
This story will be
on the news in an hour.

575
00:56:13,865 --> 00:56:16,925
- Tomorrow's news today.
- Just so.

576
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26,074
My name is Dr. Kaufman.

577
00:56:26,144 --> 00:56:29,545
I am an outstanding
pistol marksman.

578
00:56:29,614 --> 00:56:31,775
Take my word for it, ja?

579
00:56:36,854 --> 00:56:38,788
Get the sledgehammers.

580
00:56:51,335 --> 00:56:53,997
She struggled terribly,
Mr. Bond.

581
00:56:54,072 --> 00:56:57,633
It's a pity you got her
involved in all this.

582
00:57:00,244 --> 00:57:02,906
It won't look like a suicide
if you shoot me from over there.

583
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:05,676
I am a professor
of forensic medicine.

584
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,310
Believe me, Mr. Bond,
I could shoot you from Stuttgart...

585
00:57:08,386 --> 00:57:10,980
and still create the proper effect.

586
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:22,022
My art is in great demand,
Mr. Bond.

587
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,091
I go all over the world.

588
00:57:24,168 --> 00:57:28,628
I am especially good
at the celebrity overdose.

589
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:33,200
But now, I'm afraid, Mr. Bond,
that our little...

590
00:57:33,277 --> 00:57:38,374
Stamper!
Stop yelling in my ear, ja?

591
00:57:38,449 --> 00:57:40,940
Sir, they can't get into the car.

592
00:57:41,919 --> 00:57:43,511
You can't be serious.

593
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:47,285
- Did you call the Auto Club?
- Do you want to call them?

594
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:49,292
Make him tell you how to open it.

595
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,294
Okay, I ask.

596
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:55,199
This is very embarrassing.

597
00:57:55,266 --> 00:57:57,496
It seems there is
a red box in your car.

598
00:57:57,568 --> 00:57:59,433
They can't get to it.

599
00:57:59,504 --> 00:58:03,463
They want me
to make you unlock the car.

600
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:06,339
I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what to say.

601
00:58:07,778 --> 00:58:11,043
I am to torture you
if you don't do it.

602
00:58:11,115 --> 00:58:14,380
- You've a doctorate in that too?
- No, no, no.

603
00:58:14,452 --> 00:58:18,320
This is more like a hobby.
But I'm very gifted.

604
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:20,323
Oh, I believe you.

605
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:23,593
- My cell phone opens the car.
- No, Mr. Bond.

606
00:58:23,661 --> 00:58:25,730
I do it, ja?

607
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:32,895
Recall, three, send.

608
00:58:43,848 --> 00:58:45,315
Wait.

609
00:58:45,382 --> 00:58:48,317
I'm just a professional
doing a job.

610
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,678
Me too.

611
00:59:19,683 --> 00:59:20,945
Dr. Kaufman.

612
00:59:52,566 --> 00:59:55,000
Welcome.
Please fasten seat belt.

613
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:03,339
Reduce speed.

614
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,604
Pedestrians in roadway.

615
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,536
Driver alert.

616
01:01:11,611 --> 01:01:14,011
Obstruction ahead.
Reduce speed now.

617
01:02:35,462 --> 01:02:39,057
Reminder:
Unsafe driving will void warranty.

618
01:03:25,342 --> 01:03:27,640
Congratulations
on a safe journey.

619
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:38,437
U.S. Air Base,
South China Sea

620
01:03:52,886 --> 01:03:55,047
Yo! Jimbo!

621
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,147
Wade, what are you doing here?

622
01:03:57,224 --> 01:04:00,216
You know the world's my office.
Let's go this way.

623
01:04:00,293 --> 01:04:02,227
Did Q bring you up to speed?

624
01:04:02,295 --> 01:04:05,264
Yeah. I brought along
the G.P.S. Calibration unit.

625
01:04:05,332 --> 01:04:10,133
By the way, officially Uncle Sam is
completely neutral in this turkey shoot.

626
01:04:10,203 --> 01:04:11,602
And unofficially?

627
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:14,799
We have no interest in seeing
World War Three, unless we start it.

628
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:18,242
Dr. Greenwalt.
He's the Air Force G.P.S. Expert.

629
01:04:18,311 --> 01:04:20,245
Sorry about all this security...

630
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:23,578
but the G.P.S. Encoder is one of
the most closely guarded secrets...

631
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,083
in the U.S. Military.

632
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,017
Show him what you got.

633
01:04:31,324 --> 01:04:34,259
Jesus, it's the missing encoder.
How the hell did you get that?

634
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:36,921
Picked it up in Hamburg
yesterday morning.

635
01:04:36,997 --> 01:04:40,364
Could somebody use this
to send a ship off course?

636
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:41,958
- Like the Devonshire?
- Whoa!

637
01:04:42,035 --> 01:04:44,265
I didn't you hear anybody mention
the Devonshire. Did you?

638
01:04:44,337 --> 01:04:48,296
- No.
- Good. So just answer his question.

639
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:50,866
In theory, if you could alter
the timing chip...

640
01:04:50,944 --> 01:04:53,378
you could slowly
send a ship off course.

641
01:04:53,447 --> 01:04:57,440
- Like putting a magnet near a compass.
- Yeah, exactly.

642
01:04:57,517 --> 01:04:59,883
- Then check this out.
- Oh, yeah.

643
01:05:11,798 --> 01:05:15,325
Those two circles should be
lining up on top of each other.

644
01:05:15,402 --> 01:05:17,336
Somebody's tampered
with your encoder.

645
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:22,437
If we knew the last time and position
the Devonshire thought she was...

646
01:05:22,509 --> 01:05:25,273
could you figure out
exactly where she sank?

647
01:05:25,345 --> 01:05:26,835
Sure.

648
01:05:27,547 --> 01:05:28,479
Wade...

649
01:05:30,016 --> 01:05:32,576
I have a small favor to ask.

650
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:42,094
The high-altitude,
low opening jump... the HALO jump...

651
01:05:42,162 --> 01:05:45,359
is where we get the most fatalities,
so listen up.

652
01:05:45,432 --> 01:05:49,732
You free-fall for 5 miles and use your
oxygen, or you'll die of asphyxiation.

653
01:05:49,803 --> 01:05:51,395
Sounds like my first marriage.

654
01:05:52,205 --> 01:05:53,502
After the free-fall...

655
01:05:53,573 --> 01:05:56,235
pop the chute at 200 feet,
below the Chinese radar.

656
01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:58,243
You'll be traveling
at over 200 miles an hour.

657
01:05:58,311 --> 01:06:00,245
This snaps your head back
like a cantaloupe.

658
01:06:00,313 --> 01:06:02,873
Don't crack your skull open
on the tanks.

659
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:04,541
I'll keep that in mind.

660
01:06:04,618 --> 01:06:08,315
One last thing: When you hit the water
don't forget to cut away your chute.

661
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:12,984
90% of people killed in the HALO jump
got tangled in their chutes and drowned.

662
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:14,287
Got it?

663
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:16,556
Seems like a lot
just to save the world.

664
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:18,222
I've got no choice.

665
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:21,392
I have to prove that ship
was deliberately set off course.

666
01:06:21,468 --> 01:06:22,696
One minute!

667
01:06:22,769 --> 01:06:24,703
- Is the pickup set?
- You bet.

668
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:28,867
After your mission, turn on your beacon.
The extraction team will pick you up.

669
01:06:30,844 --> 01:06:33,176
Buddha bless!

670
01:06:33,246 --> 01:06:35,544
- I just noticed something.
- Yeah?

671
01:06:35,615 --> 01:06:38,243
This is where the ship
thought it was.

672
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:40,718
This is where it really is.
But see that island?

673
01:06:40,787 --> 01:06:44,141
- Yeah.
- That means where he's jumping...

674
01:06:44,274 --> 01:06:46,799
between the British
and Chinese fleets...

675
01:06:46,876 --> 01:06:49,174
Technically they're not
in Chinese territorial waters.

676
01:06:49,245 --> 01:06:51,873
- They belong to Vietnam.
- Vietnam?

677
01:06:51,948 --> 01:06:55,145
Does he have any
U.S. Government markings on him?

678
01:06:55,218 --> 01:06:57,345
The parachute,
the wet suit, the fins.

679
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:00,651
If the Vietnamese catch him,
they're gonna go crazy.

680
01:07:05,962 --> 01:07:08,089
He didn't even say good-bye.

681
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:29,783
Still interested
in hostile takeovers?

682
01:11:30,626 --> 01:11:34,147
It's the opportunities for travel
that I like best about banking.

683
01:11:35,915 --> 01:11:37,940
Bring the boat.

684
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,612
What are you waiting for?

685
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:55,525
Get them out of the water.

686
01:12:09,815 --> 01:12:14,479
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you were following me around, Mr. Bond.

687
01:12:14,554 --> 01:12:16,522
You'll have to admit, though...

688
01:12:16,589 --> 01:12:19,717
we seem to have developed
a certain attachment to each other.

689
01:12:20,793 --> 01:12:22,886
Hopefully not for long.

690
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:29,260
Another Carver building.

691
01:12:29,335 --> 01:12:32,998
If I didn't know better, I'd say
he'd developed an edifice complex.

692
01:12:52,525 --> 01:12:54,356
General Chang?

693
01:12:54,427 --> 01:12:56,793
Friend of yours?

694
01:12:59,065 --> 01:13:01,533
Mr. Bond. Miss Lin.

695
01:13:03,402 --> 01:13:04,926
Welcome to Saigon.

696
01:13:05,004 --> 01:13:06,938
It's always nice
to see you, Elliot.

697
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,536
I hadn't intended opening
this center until tomorrow...

698
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:14,478
but as you're here you can help me
to write the inaugural story...

699
01:13:14,547 --> 01:13:16,174
your obituaries.

700
01:13:16,249 --> 01:13:19,047
I hope you extended
the same courtesy to Paris.

701
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,254
Actually, Mr. Bond, you're the one
who wrote my late wife's obituary...

702
01:13:25,324 --> 01:13:27,189
when you asked her
to betray me.

703
01:13:28,761 --> 01:13:30,319
Still, let's see...

704
01:13:30,396 --> 01:13:33,490
"British secret service agent
James Bond...

705
01:13:33,566 --> 01:13:35,659
and his collaborator
Wai Lin...

706
01:13:35,735 --> 01:13:38,704
of the Chinese People's
External Security Force...

707
01:13:38,771 --> 01:13:40,295
were found...

708
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,404
dead this morning...

709
01:13:43,476 --> 01:13:45,410
in Vietnam. "

710
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,207
Lacks punch, don't you think?

711
01:13:50,283 --> 01:13:54,242
It's old news, Elliot.
We've been working together for months.

712
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,312
Both our governments know
what you and General Chang are up to.

713
01:13:59,225 --> 01:14:01,159
I don't think so.

714
01:14:01,227 --> 01:14:03,491
You may have seen the general
in the hallway just now...

715
01:14:03,562 --> 01:14:05,723
but perhaps,
with all your jetting around...

716
01:14:05,798 --> 01:14:08,926
you've not had chance to peruse
today's headlines.

717
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:17,906
I rather like the last one.
It isn't even mine.

718
01:14:17,977 --> 01:14:20,070
I never believe what I read
in the press anyway.

719
01:14:20,146 --> 01:14:23,274
Ah. Therein lies
your problem, Mr. Bond.

720
01:14:23,349 --> 01:14:27,786
We're both men of action,
but your era and Miss Lin's is passing.

721
01:14:27,853 --> 01:14:32,290
Words are the new weapons,
satellites the new artillery.

722
01:14:32,358 --> 01:14:35,589
And you become the new
supreme allied commander?

723
01:14:35,661 --> 01:14:37,026
Exactly!

724
01:14:37,096 --> 01:14:40,031
Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon had his armies...

725
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:44,102
I have my divisions...
TV, news, magazines.

726
01:14:45,137 --> 01:14:48,300
And by midnight I'll have reached
and influenced more people...

727
01:14:48,374 --> 01:14:52,071
than anyone in the history
of this planet, save God Himself.

728
01:14:52,878 --> 01:14:55,813
And the best He ever managed
was the Sermon on the Mount.

729
01:14:55,881 --> 01:14:57,405
You really are quite insane.

730
01:14:58,984 --> 01:15:01,714
The distance
between insanity and genius...

731
01:15:01,787 --> 01:15:03,721
is measured only by success.

732
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:05,120
Excuse me.

733
01:15:05,925 --> 01:15:08,485
General Chang is waiting.

734
01:15:08,561 --> 01:15:11,325
If you'll forgive me,
your appearance here has forced me...

735
01:15:11,397 --> 01:15:13,331
to move up
my timetable slightly.

736
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:17,096
I'll leave you in the capable hands
of Mr. Stamper and his toys.

737
01:15:17,169 --> 01:15:18,761
Perhaps you'd like to see them.

738
01:15:19,905 --> 01:15:21,395
Sir. The helicopter.

739
01:15:21,474 --> 01:15:22,771
Thanks, Gupta.

740
01:15:22,842 --> 01:15:25,902
Mr. Stamper is a protege
of the late Dr. Kaufman...

741
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:29,141
who was schooling him in
the ancient art of chakra torture.

742
01:15:30,216 --> 01:15:32,150
He was like a father to me.

743
01:15:32,218 --> 01:15:35,346
Really?
Interesting role model.

744
01:15:35,421 --> 01:15:38,515
According to Eastern philosophy,
the body has seven chakra points.

745
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:41,822
Energy centers,
like the heart or genitals.

746
01:15:41,894 --> 01:15:45,227
The purpose of these implements
is to probe those organs...

747
01:15:45,297 --> 01:15:47,492
inflicting the maximum amount
of pain...

748
01:15:47,566 --> 01:15:50,763
whilst keeping the victim alive
for as long as possible.

749
01:15:50,836 --> 01:15:53,327
Dr. Kaufman's record
was 52 hours.

750
01:15:54,173 --> 01:15:56,198
I'm hoping to break it.

751
01:15:56,275 --> 01:15:59,972
Hmm. I would've thought watching
your TV shows was torture enough.

752
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:02,813
Save this one till last.

753
01:16:03,883 --> 01:16:05,942
When you remove Mr. Bond's heart...

754
01:16:06,018 --> 01:16:10,182
there should be just enough time
for him to watch it stop beating.

755
01:16:10,256 --> 01:16:11,689
Excuse me.

756
01:16:40,469 --> 01:16:41,959
Go! Go! Go! Go!

757
01:16:49,412 --> 01:16:51,573
We can use the banner.

758
01:16:54,383 --> 01:16:56,078
Hope it holds.

759
01:16:57,687 --> 01:17:00,679
- Get after them!
- Ready? Go!

760
01:17:25,514 --> 01:17:27,379
Next time
I'll take the elevator.

761
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:34,189
Push! Push!

762
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,600
- Get a car!
- No, no!

763
01:17:55,678 --> 01:17:58,010
- Yes, a car!
- A bike is quicker.

764
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:01,416
The keys.
Someone always forgets them.

765
01:18:01,484 --> 01:18:04,180
What are you doing?
I'm driving. Get off.

766
01:18:05,554 --> 01:18:07,146
Get on the back.

767
01:18:10,059 --> 01:18:11,754
I'm slipping.

768
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:16,723
Stop fidgeting back there.

769
01:18:18,634 --> 01:18:20,465
What are you...

770
01:18:20,536 --> 01:18:22,026
Give me that.

771
01:18:22,104 --> 01:18:24,163
Clutch! Clutch! Clutch!

772
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,798
- Turn right.
- No, left.

773
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,866
Who's driving?
Come on!

774
01:18:59,675 --> 01:19:00,767
Clutch!

775
01:19:06,882 --> 01:19:08,406
Left! Left!

776
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,147
How many back there?

777
01:19:13,222 --> 01:19:15,213
I can't see. Hold on.

778
01:19:17,993 --> 01:19:19,654
What are you... What?

779
01:19:21,797 --> 01:19:25,233
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'd never dream of it.

780
01:19:27,169 --> 01:19:27,965
One... No, two.

781
01:19:34,643 --> 01:19:36,508
- Go for the barrels.
- What?

782
01:19:39,815 --> 01:19:40,804
Very good.

783
01:20:01,737 --> 01:20:03,329
Hold on!

784
01:20:10,913 --> 01:20:13,177
Let's take the highway.

785
01:20:33,235 --> 01:20:35,965
- Helicopter!
- All right, keep your shirt on.

786
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:25,945
- Get on the back of the bike.
- Are you trying to protect me?

787
01:21:26,021 --> 01:21:28,512
No. I need to balance the bike.
Get on the back.

788
01:21:37,166 --> 01:21:38,963
- You ready?
- Yeah.

789
01:21:39,034 --> 01:21:41,229
Go!

790
01:21:53,682 --> 01:21:55,309
Pop the clutch.

791
01:22:25,347 --> 01:22:26,473
It's behind us.

792
01:22:26,548 --> 01:22:28,015
Move!

793
01:22:30,185 --> 01:22:32,585
Get out of the way!

794
01:23:03,052 --> 01:23:04,986
You see the chopper?

795
01:23:06,221 --> 01:23:08,155
I can't see. Hold on.

796
01:23:13,562 --> 01:23:14,654
What are you...

797
01:23:28,077 --> 01:23:29,066
Trapped.

798
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,142
Never.

799
01:24:23,248 --> 01:24:25,182
Would you pass the soap?

800
01:24:28,653 --> 01:24:30,518
Over there.

801
01:24:33,758 --> 01:24:36,318
You were pretty good
with that hook.

802
01:24:36,394 --> 01:24:39,625
It comes from growing up
in a rough neighborhood.

803
01:24:39,698 --> 01:24:41,962
You were pretty good
on the bike.

804
01:24:42,033 --> 01:24:45,969
Well, that comes from
not growing up at all.

805
01:24:46,037 --> 01:24:48,028
Here. Allow me.

806
01:24:50,008 --> 01:24:51,976
Don't get any ideas, Mr. Bond.

807
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:54,978
Just off the cuff,
I thought we might link up.

808
01:24:56,815 --> 01:24:58,248
Work hand in hand?

809
01:24:58,316 --> 01:25:01,717
Stick closer to each other.

810
01:25:01,786 --> 01:25:03,720
Maybe we go after
General Chang together.

811
01:25:05,824 --> 01:25:07,485
Your turn.

812
01:25:07,559 --> 01:25:09,527
Thanks for washing my hair.

813
01:25:10,829 --> 01:25:12,763
I work alone.

814
01:27:43,515 --> 01:27:45,506
Lucky for you I stopped by.

815
01:27:46,518 --> 01:27:48,452
I could've
taken care of him.

816
01:27:50,255 --> 01:27:52,382
Mm-hmm.
But you didn't.

817
01:27:52,457 --> 01:27:54,391
Give me the earring.

818
01:27:56,194 --> 01:28:00,255
Copy of a Makarov 59.
Standard issue, Chinese Army.

819
01:28:01,366 --> 01:28:03,425
Looks like General Chang
wants you dead.

820
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:05,696
You still think
you can do this alone?

821
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:09,228
It depends whether your mission
is peace or revenge.

822
01:28:09,307 --> 01:28:11,741
This is about stopping a war.

823
01:28:17,282 --> 01:28:19,842
Last year we found
stealth material was missing...

824
01:28:19,918 --> 01:28:22,182
from one of
General Chang's bases.

825
01:28:22,253 --> 01:28:24,721
I followed a lead
to Carver's headquarters in Hamburg.

826
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:26,381
Stealth material?

827
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:28,392
We thought he was building
a stealth plane.

828
01:28:29,894 --> 01:28:32,556
No. Stealth boat.

829
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:34,655
That's the only way they could
get close to the Devonshire...

830
01:28:34,733 --> 01:28:37,065
so they could drill inside
the missile room.

831
01:28:37,135 --> 01:28:40,969
Remember? They stole
a cruise missile from that ship.

832
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:43,940
He said he was moving the timetable
forward to midnight.

833
01:28:44,008 --> 01:28:46,067
Yes, of course he did.

834
01:28:46,144 --> 01:28:48,408
Under cover of darkness
he'll position the stealth boat...

835
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,209
near the British fleet...

836
01:28:50,281 --> 01:28:52,909
fire the missile into China.

837
01:28:52,984 --> 01:28:56,886
- And we will retaliate.
- And Carver will provide the pictures.

838
01:28:57,722 --> 01:28:59,587
- I have to warn Beijing.
- No.

839
01:28:59,657 --> 01:29:02,125
Let's warn both our governments,
get them talking.

840
01:29:02,193 --> 01:29:05,120
- It'll give us time to find the boat.
- Stand up.

841
01:29:26,718 --> 01:29:28,743
Hmm.
It's just like home.

842
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:31,254
You get the equipment,
I'll send the messages.

843
01:29:36,995 --> 01:29:38,428
On second thought...

844
01:29:38,496 --> 01:29:39,758
you type.

845
01:29:40,832 --> 01:29:42,527
First we find the boat.

846
01:29:44,169 --> 01:29:46,933
Of all the harbors and inlets
controlled by General Chang...

847
01:29:47,939 --> 01:29:50,840
22 are in
highly populated areas.

848
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:53,537
That leaves 14
where he could hide a stealth boat.

849
01:29:53,611 --> 01:29:55,545
You can see it during the day.

850
01:29:55,613 --> 01:29:58,047
It's invisible to radar,
but not the human eye.

851
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:02,381
Very novel.

852
01:30:03,288 --> 01:30:05,483
He'd have to hide it someplace...

853
01:30:05,557 --> 01:30:07,889
where he could sail to the Devonshire
and back in one night.

854
01:30:09,561 --> 01:30:10,823
This looks familiar.

855
01:30:10,895 --> 01:30:12,795
We've made some improvements.

856
01:30:13,598 --> 01:30:14,690
Have you, indeed?

857
01:30:14,766 --> 01:30:18,998
Okay. Four hours out
and four hours back.

858
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:23,131
Let's assume the boat is traveling
at a speed of 30 knots.

859
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:28,539
I've always been a fan
of Chinese technology.

860
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:31,378
According to this...

861
01:30:31,449 --> 01:30:34,145
there are four places
where he could harbor the boat.

862
01:30:34,219 --> 01:30:36,084
Up on your left.

863
01:30:38,089 --> 01:30:41,252
Run a cross check on those areas
for anything suspicious.

864
01:30:48,199 --> 01:30:50,326
Ah, the new Walther.

865
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:52,528
I asked Q for one of these.

866
01:31:05,383 --> 01:31:07,783
I've got it. Look.

867
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:11,750
Four missing boats.
Three unexplained drownings.

868
01:31:11,823 --> 01:31:13,085
That has to be it.

869
01:31:15,126 --> 01:31:17,060
Ha Long Bay.

870
01:31:33,912 --> 01:31:35,379
He knows the island.

871
01:31:35,447 --> 01:31:39,315
He says that it's dangerous for
boats to be around there at sunset...

872
01:31:39,384 --> 01:31:42,478
but for 5,000 American dollars...

873
01:31:42,554 --> 01:31:43,987
he'll take us.

874
01:31:44,056 --> 01:31:45,250
Good.

875
01:31:45,323 --> 01:31:47,257
Maybe he'll take a check.

876
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,674
It's mostly dull routine,
of course...

877
01:32:04,743 --> 01:32:08,679
but every now and then you get to sail
on a beautiful evening like this...

878
01:32:08,747 --> 01:32:13,150
and sometimes work with a decadent agent
of a corrupt Western power.

879
01:32:13,218 --> 01:32:15,778
And they say Communists
don't know how to have fun.

880
01:32:16,655 --> 01:32:18,646
I hate to disappoint you...

881
01:32:18,724 --> 01:32:21,192
but I don't even have
a little red book.

882
01:32:24,696 --> 01:32:26,630
If anything happens to me...

883
01:32:26,698 --> 01:32:29,189
the fuses for the mines
are in here.

884
01:32:32,404 --> 01:32:34,429
We're gonna finish this
together.

885
01:32:34,506 --> 01:32:37,475
And if I may say so,
you found the right...

886
01:32:37,542 --> 01:32:41,000
decadent,
corrupt Western agent...

887
01:32:41,079 --> 01:32:43,013
as a partner.

888
01:33:03,034 --> 01:33:05,161
- See the stealth?
- No.

889
01:33:05,237 --> 01:33:08,900
It's getting late
and this is the last cove in the bay.

890
01:33:17,249 --> 01:33:19,183
Yeah, that's it.

891
01:33:48,613 --> 01:33:50,012
Set the timers for ten minutes.

892
01:33:50,081 --> 01:33:53,073
That'll give us time to get out of here
before the ship explodes.

893
01:33:53,151 --> 01:33:55,847
Even if it doesn't sink,
it'll show up on radar.

894
01:33:55,921 --> 01:33:58,856
- Our fleets will finish the job.
- If they got our message.

895
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:01,859
- Okay, you, up and over.
- Okay.

896
01:34:17,742 --> 01:34:19,710
We're in position
between the fleets.

897
01:34:19,778 --> 01:34:23,908
Fire one missile
at the flagship of each fleet.

898
01:34:23,982 --> 01:34:27,884
The Chinese will think the British
are rattling the saber...

899
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:31,650
the British will think the Chinese
are being belligerent...

900
01:34:31,723 --> 01:34:35,659
and the media will provide
cool, objective coverage.

901
01:34:37,729 --> 01:34:39,959
Let the mayhem begin.

902
01:34:50,141 --> 01:34:51,438
Missile lock-on.

903
01:34:51,509 --> 01:34:55,843
Send a signal to the Admiralty:
"Task group under missile attack. "

904
01:34:57,549 --> 01:35:00,848
Sir, AWACS reports two waves
of land-based MIG 21s inbound.

905
01:35:00,919 --> 01:35:03,615
The first group should be
on our screens in two minutes.

906
01:35:03,688 --> 01:35:07,920
How long before the MiGs are within
firing range of the British fleet?

907
01:35:07,993 --> 01:35:09,085
Twelve minutes.

908
01:35:10,595 --> 01:35:13,120
What the hell do I pay you for?

909
01:35:16,101 --> 01:35:19,036
If she's there,
Bond is there.

910
01:35:19,104 --> 01:35:20,662
Stamper, find them.

911
01:35:26,511 --> 01:35:29,275
Wai Lin! Wai Lin!
Camera!

912
01:35:38,523 --> 01:35:40,457
If she blinks, kill her.

913
01:35:40,525 --> 01:35:42,390
You come with me.

914
01:36:28,306 --> 01:36:31,605
Stamper to Bridge.
Bond is dead.

915
01:36:31,676 --> 01:36:33,075
Delicious.

916
01:36:33,144 --> 01:36:36,545
Make sure you clear all the mines,
and bring the girl up to me.

917
01:36:41,953 --> 01:36:44,080
Are you sure
you want her up here?

918
01:36:44,956 --> 01:36:46,890
It's my business, Mr. Gupta.

919
01:36:46,958 --> 01:36:48,789
I like an audience.

920
01:36:54,699 --> 01:36:57,190
Ah, Miss Lin.

921
01:36:57,268 --> 01:37:00,032
Your countrymen are being
so cooperative...

922
01:37:00,105 --> 01:37:02,539
so predictably eager
to save face.

923
01:37:02,607 --> 01:37:05,906
My government knows you're out here.
They're looking for you.

924
01:37:06,811 --> 01:37:08,779
Not according to our radar...

925
01:37:08,847 --> 01:37:13,250
where it seems your MiGs
are about to attack the British fleet...

926
01:37:13,318 --> 01:37:14,979
in how many minutes?

927
01:37:15,053 --> 01:37:16,315
Nine minutes to firing range.

928
01:37:16,388 --> 01:37:19,824
And even if they were
looking for me...

929
01:37:19,891 --> 01:37:21,449
we're on a stealth boat.

930
01:37:22,861 --> 01:37:26,126
They can't see me,
or you...

931
01:37:26,197 --> 01:37:27,596
or even your friend...

932
01:37:27,665 --> 01:37:29,132
the late Commander Bond...

933
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:33,864
who is at this moment on his way
to the bottom of the South China Sea.

934
01:37:34,939 --> 01:37:36,907
He's my new anchorman.

935
01:37:49,387 --> 01:37:50,911
Pathetic.

936
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,421
What on earth's going on?

937
01:37:57,495 --> 01:37:59,895
A message from 007...

938
01:37:59,964 --> 01:38:02,899
just confirmed by
my opposite number in China.

939
01:38:02,967 --> 01:38:07,301
"Tell the fleet to search for a ship
that's almost invisible to radar. "

940
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:09,800
The Chinese aren't the enemy.

941
01:38:09,874 --> 01:38:13,310
Carver's been playing
both sides for fools.

942
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:18,349
Admiral, sir,
urgent message from the Admiralty.

943
01:38:20,685 --> 01:38:22,016
Look at this.

944
01:38:24,089 --> 01:38:27,923
Anything on radar that looks very small?
Lifeboat, periscope, anything?

945
01:38:27,992 --> 01:38:31,428
- No, sir.
- Stealth boat, sir? They have gone mad.

946
01:38:38,701 --> 01:38:43,400
What you're about to witness, Miss Lin,
is not so much a missile attack...

947
01:38:43,473 --> 01:38:45,464
but the launch
of a new world order.

948
01:38:45,542 --> 01:38:49,808
In five minutes, after your countrymen
have attacked the British fleet...

949
01:38:49,879 --> 01:38:53,576
I shall retaliate
for dear old England...

950
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:56,483
by sending this missile
into Beijing...

951
01:38:56,553 --> 01:38:59,989
where General Chang has just called
an emergency meeting...

952
01:39:00,056 --> 01:39:02,217
of the Chinese high command.

953
01:39:02,292 --> 01:39:03,884
Unfortunately...

954
01:39:05,328 --> 01:39:08,525
General Chang
will be delayed in traffic...

955
01:39:08,598 --> 01:39:13,399
arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders...

956
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:17,873
and too late to stop the air force
from sinking the entire British fleet.

957
01:39:19,609 --> 01:39:23,739
But he will be just in time to take over
the government, negotiate a truce...

958
01:39:23,813 --> 01:39:26,543
and emerge as a world leader...

959
01:39:26,616 --> 01:39:29,176
with a Nobel Peace Prize.

960
01:39:29,252 --> 01:39:31,447
- And what do you get?
- Me?

961
01:39:32,322 --> 01:39:34,256
Oh, nothing.

962
01:39:35,892 --> 01:39:39,953
Just exclusive broadcasting rights
in China for the next hundred years.

963
01:39:42,365 --> 01:39:44,299
Ready to rock and ruin.

964
01:39:45,368 --> 01:39:48,895
If you'll excuse me, my dear,
I have something of a deadline to meet.

965
01:39:48,972 --> 01:39:50,530
Prepare for the missile launch.

966
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:55,472
Mr. Gupta.

967
01:39:55,545 --> 01:39:57,911
Hello, Elliot.

968
01:39:57,981 --> 01:40:00,279
Interesting plan.

969
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:02,818
But I think I have
something of yours.

970
01:40:02,886 --> 01:40:06,117
So much for German efficiency.
Mr. Stamper.

971
01:40:15,298 --> 01:40:17,664
- Don't shoot him yet.
- Hold your fire.

972
01:40:19,636 --> 01:40:22,070
Welcome to my world crisis,
Mr. Bond.

973
01:40:22,772 --> 01:40:23,830
Even trade, Elliot.

974
01:40:23,907 --> 01:40:25,772
Gupta for Wai Lin.

975
01:40:25,842 --> 01:40:28,470
You can't fire the missile
without him.

976
01:40:28,545 --> 01:40:32,174
And it seems you can't resist
any woman in my possession.

977
01:40:33,683 --> 01:40:35,776
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!

978
01:40:35,852 --> 01:40:39,015
I told you we're going to
finish this together.

979
01:40:39,088 --> 01:40:41,079
Oh, how romantic.

980
01:40:42,592 --> 01:40:45,254
Do you realize
how absurd your position is?

981
01:40:45,328 --> 01:40:48,024
No more absurd than
starting a war for ratings.

982
01:40:48,097 --> 01:40:53,091
Great men have always manipulated
the media to save the world.

983
01:40:53,169 --> 01:40:55,797
Look at William Randolph Hearst,
who told his photographers...

984
01:40:55,872 --> 01:40:59,968
"You provide the pictures,
I'll provide the war. "

985
01:41:00,043 --> 01:41:02,273
I've just taken it
one step further.

986
01:41:06,182 --> 01:41:07,308
Sorry about that.

987
01:41:07,383 --> 01:41:10,841
I tuned out there
for a moment, Elliot.

988
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:12,683
Touch.

989
01:41:13,723 --> 01:41:14,951
Mr. Gupta...

990
01:41:15,024 --> 01:41:16,787
is the missile ready to fire?

991
01:41:16,859 --> 01:41:19,293
Press the magic button,
Beijing disappears.

992
01:41:20,463 --> 01:41:23,489
Then it seems
you've outlived your contract.

993
01:41:25,935 --> 01:41:28,904
You see, Mr. Bond,
I have a backup plan.

994
01:41:28,972 --> 01:41:30,803
Uh-huh. So do I.

995
01:41:55,498 --> 01:41:57,830
He's breached the hull.
They'll see us on radar.

996
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:01,529
Sir, we have a small,
intermittent contact on the surface.

997
01:42:01,604 --> 01:42:04,437
Plot the bearing 1-1-2 degrees.

998
01:42:04,507 --> 01:42:08,671
It's a very weak signal, but I'd swear
it wasn't there a second ago, sir.

999
01:42:08,745 --> 01:42:12,909
Yeoman, tell all ships not to fire on
the Chinese for any reason whatsoever.

1000
01:42:12,982 --> 01:42:15,678
Send the message
to the Chinese fleet commander:

1001
01:42:15,752 --> 01:42:17,242
"Have sighted unknown ship... "

1002
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:20,187
Get those fires out!

1003
01:42:20,256 --> 01:42:22,349
Get down there
and protect the missile.

1004
01:42:22,425 --> 01:42:26,953
Oh, and Mr. Stamper,
would you please kill those bastards?

1005
01:42:43,846 --> 01:42:45,643
Nice work.

1006
01:42:48,985 --> 01:42:51,044
They're speeding up.

1007
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:54,283
- We have to stop the boat.
- Can you take care of the engine room?

1008
01:42:54,357 --> 01:42:56,882
- Of course.
- Good. Do it and get off the ship.

1009
01:42:58,728 --> 01:43:00,662
I'm going to stop the missile.

1010
01:43:10,807 --> 01:43:12,741
Signal from
the Chinese fleet commander.

1011
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:16,344
"To Royal Navy Task Group:

1012
01:43:16,412 --> 01:43:19,313
We also have the unknown ship
on our screens.

1013
01:43:19,382 --> 01:43:22,476
We will not fire
unless it turns toward China.

1014
01:43:22,552 --> 01:43:24,349
Until then, she's yours. "

1015
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:27,753
Now, Captain, whatever
the hell that thing is, sink it.

1016
01:43:27,824 --> 01:43:31,282
Right, sir. Is that echo
too weak for missile lock?

1017
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,691
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

1018
01:43:32,762 --> 01:43:34,821
We'll do it
the old-fashioned way.

1019
01:43:41,938 --> 01:43:44,498
Bond turned us
into the target.

1020
01:43:44,574 --> 01:43:46,542
Along with himself.

1021
01:43:46,609 --> 01:43:49,237
Take evasive action.

1022
01:43:49,312 --> 01:43:51,644
Prepare the missile countdown
immediately.

1023
01:43:51,714 --> 01:43:56,276
Initializing launch sequence.
"T" minus five minutes and counting.

1024
01:43:56,352 --> 01:43:59,844
"T" minus five minutes
and counting.

1025
01:43:59,922 --> 01:44:02,049
Uh, sir,
they're making 48 knots.

1026
01:44:02,125 --> 01:44:04,685
They'll be out of range
in two minutes.

1027
01:44:04,761 --> 01:44:06,820
Keep firing.
Slow them down.

1028
01:45:09,192 --> 01:45:12,753
The engines are out.
We're sitting ducks here. Engine room.

1029
01:45:53,636 --> 01:45:54,967
Follow me!

1030
01:46:42,551 --> 01:46:46,612
"T" minus four minutes
and counting.

1031
01:47:30,733 --> 01:47:33,031
Well done.
Officer Watch, increase max.

1032
01:47:33,803 --> 01:47:34,997
Keep firing!

1033
01:47:37,173 --> 01:47:38,834
All hands, abandon ship.

1034
01:47:38,908 --> 01:47:40,569
Abandon ship.

1035
01:48:04,801 --> 01:48:08,237
Mr. Stamper,
what are you doing about the girl?

1036
01:48:08,304 --> 01:48:11,740
Perhaps you'd consider
looking in the engine room.

1037
01:48:14,711 --> 01:48:18,738
"T" minus three minutes
and counting.

1038
01:49:11,367 --> 01:49:14,302
You're too late again,
Mr. Bond.

1039
01:49:15,204 --> 01:49:17,764
It's a bad habit of yours.

1040
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,705
There's nothing you can do.

1041
01:49:27,717 --> 01:49:31,619
"T" minus two minutes
and counting.

1042
01:49:31,688 --> 01:49:33,849
The missile's fully programmed.

1043
01:49:33,923 --> 01:49:36,050
It can't be stopped.

1044
01:49:36,125 --> 01:49:38,286
In minutes
my plan will succeed.

1045
01:49:40,196 --> 01:49:42,289
Thanks largely
to your efforts...

1046
01:49:42,365 --> 01:49:44,731
the British Navy
will destroy the evidence...

1047
01:49:44,801 --> 01:49:48,168
and I'll be out of here
in a Carver news helicopter...

1048
01:49:48,237 --> 01:49:49,864
covering the event.

1049
01:49:49,939 --> 01:49:53,204
It's going to be
a fantastic show.

1050
01:49:53,276 --> 01:49:56,211
I may have some breaking news
for you, Elliot.

1051
01:50:01,951 --> 01:50:05,512
You forgot the first rule
of mass media, Elliot...

1052
01:50:08,324 --> 01:50:10,258
Give the people what they want.

1053
01:50:24,841 --> 01:50:27,776
"T" minus one minute
and counting.

1054
01:50:42,058 --> 01:50:43,685
Drop it, Mr. Bond...

1055
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,387
or I drop your friend.

1056
01:50:46,529 --> 01:50:48,793
It's over, Stamper.

1057
01:50:48,865 --> 01:50:50,526
Let her go.

1058
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,192
Not between you and me.

1059
01:50:54,137 --> 01:50:57,800
James, try the detonators.
The missile will set them off.

1060
01:50:57,874 --> 01:51:01,037
Never argue with a woman.
They're always right.

1061
01:51:15,792 --> 01:51:18,886
"T" minus 40 seconds.

1062
01:51:25,234 --> 01:51:26,895
For Carver!

1063
01:51:30,339 --> 01:51:31,670
And Kaufman!

1064
01:51:41,884 --> 01:51:44,512
I owe you
an unpleasant death, Mr. Bond.

1065
01:52:28,197 --> 01:52:31,166
"T" minus 20 seconds.

1066
01:52:34,137 --> 01:52:36,332
We die together, Mr. Bond.

1067
01:52:50,486 --> 01:52:53,512
"T" minus ten seconds.

1068
01:53:14,343 --> 01:53:15,901
Three...

1069
01:53:15,978 --> 01:53:18,538
two... one...

1070
01:54:12,101 --> 01:54:15,036
M, Bedford reports
Carver went down with the ship.

1071
01:54:15,104 --> 01:54:17,038
Seems that Bond made it.

1072
01:54:19,242 --> 01:54:21,267
Moneypenny, take this release.

1073
01:54:21,344 --> 01:54:23,778
Elliot Carver is missing,
presumed drowned...

1074
01:54:23,846 --> 01:54:28,613
while on a cruise aboard his
luxury yacht in the South China Sea.

1075
01:54:29,785 --> 01:54:32,720
At present
the local authorities believe...

1076
01:54:32,788 --> 01:54:35,222
the media mogul
committed suicide.

1077
01:54:45,334 --> 01:54:47,268
Commander Bond...

1078
01:54:48,204 --> 01:54:50,069
Colonel Lin...

1079
01:54:50,139 --> 01:54:52,539
this is the H.M.S. Bedford.

1080
01:54:54,277 --> 01:54:56,211
Are you there?

1081
01:54:58,848 --> 01:55:01,282
They're looking for us, James.

1082
01:55:02,952 --> 01:55:05,045
Let's stay under cover.
