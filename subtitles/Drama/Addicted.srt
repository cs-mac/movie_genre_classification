1
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:13,833
Come in.

2
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:21,239
Hi. I'm Dr. Spencer.

3
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,074
But you can just
call me Marcella.

4
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:25,944
Zoe Reynard.

5
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,580
I got your name through a friend

6
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,515
and she says you're

7
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:32,317
discreet.

8
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,852
Absolutely.
It comes with the territory.

9
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:37,488
Make yourself comfortable, okay?

10
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,593
Take off your coat.
Sit wherever you like.

11
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,933
I'm glad you found the time
to come and see me.

12
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:50,768
I assure you

13
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:54,973
that everything we talk about
is completely confidential.

14
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:58,576
No one sees these notes but me.

15
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:01,346
Well, it's not like I'm
a movie star, or anything.

16
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,348
Why don't we just try something?

17
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,251
Maybe you can tell me
what brought you here.

18
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,620
You know, would that
be easier for you?

19
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,989
Um, okay.

20
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,960
Well, it started the moment
that, um, I realized that

21
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,695
all the good things in my life

22
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,900
could never fill this void
that's always been there.

23
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:25,570
<i>I have the perfect life.</i>

24
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,940
<i>Wonderful home.</i>

25
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,542
<i>Best family
anyone could hope for.</i>

26
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:34,379
Show it to Granny.

27
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,514
<i>My kids are the light
of my life.</i>

28
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:37,582
<i>They're funny...
Go!</i>

29
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:40,051
<i>...and bright</i>

30
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:41,886
<i>and just delicious, you know.</i>

31
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,722
A soldier holding
a baby kangaroo... What?

32
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:46,457
No! You're, like... Okay.

33
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,326
Hold this thought. What else?
Gimme something else.

34
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:49,861
Up high. It's a torch!

35
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,296
It's a...

36
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,664
Uh, Statue of Liberty!

37
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,432
Yay!

38
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,933
Oh, my God!
How did he get that?

39
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,735
Whoo-hoo!
Okay, now you.

40
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,637
<i>My momma's the kind of woman</i>

41
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,941
<i>whose hug could turn
a dark day bright.</i>

42
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:06,911
<i>My husband Jason
is every woman's dream.</i>

43
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:08,857
<i>He's my first love
and my soul mate.</i>

44
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,775
Oh, yeah. Yeah!

45
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:57,695
It was so good, baby.

46
00:04:57,696 --> 00:04:58,930
You wanna go for Round 3?

47
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,065
Mmm.

48
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,800
Mmm.

49
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,605
Mmm. Wanna do something special.

50
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,374
Do you?
Mmm. Yeah.

51
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,511
That feels so good.
I love you.

52
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:15,648
Really?

53
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,657
Mmm-hmm.

54
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,647
Good morning, Zoe.

55
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,715
Would you like a tracking number,
so you can give them a call?

56
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:25,850
Good morning, boss.

57
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,185
Good morning, Shane.

58
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,220
You look absolutely dazzling,
as usual.

59
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,523
Thank you.

60
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,096
Can you tell Brina
to come see me

61
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:41,098
when she gets in?
Mmm-hmm.

62
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,633
Brina is here.

63
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,636
Brina is always here.
Brina lives here.

64
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,939
Hmm. Maybe I should
charge you for rent.

65
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,740
Maybe you should start
paying me more.

66
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:50,975
Maybe I should.

67
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:53,110
- Maybe you can't afford it.
- Maybe I'll do it anyhow.

68
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:54,512
Maybe I won't let you.

69
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:55,880
Hey! I'm the boss.

70
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,149
And I'm here to keep you
being the boss.

71
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,984
You try to pay me more,
and I'll quit.

72
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:01,719
Okay, I'm confused.

73
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,754
All right.
Down to business.

74
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,056
Quinton Canosa...

75
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,791
Quinton Canosa exhibit.

76
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,193
I need...
A catalog of his art.

77
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,962
And also...
His bio,

78
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,797
references, history...

79
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:14,899
And finally...
Nope, can't get that.

80
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,634
What?
His photo.

81
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,803
He doesn't let people
take his photo.

82
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:22,106
I was gonna say "croissant,"
but thanks for the info.

83
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,875
So, wait, this guy
still doesn't have a rep?

84
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,743
Amazing.
I know.

85
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:27,356
Well, he's all about the art.

86
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:31,916
"Quinton Canosa,
the people's artist."

87
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,184
Mmm-hmm.

88
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,585
He's amazing.

89
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:36,120
Yeah.

90
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:39,991
You know,
every piece just grabs you,

91
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,159
you know, in the gut.

92
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,095
We could license his work

93
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,265
and introduce him to
a whole new world of revenue.

94
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,767
Okay.
"Revenue" is a good word.

95
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,738
Do your thing, girl.
Go get that revenue.

96
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,173
Ooh!
And once that happens,

97
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:58,577
we need to reinstate
mani-pedi Fridays.

98
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,593
Uh, excuse me.

99
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,630
Do you like it?

100
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,865
Like it? I...
I love it. Yeah.

101
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:30,201
Quinton Canosa's
an incredible talent.

102
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,905
Huh. If you say so.

103
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,109
Do you know anything about art?

104
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,944
That what you call it?

105
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,145
Okay, uh...

106
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,080
Quinton Canosa's genius, okay?

107
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,983
He's one of the greatest
artists of our time.

108
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:49,207
If you can't see that, I don't
know what you're doing here.

109
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,091
Nice work, Quinton.

110
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,393
Really nice.

111
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,794
Appreciate it.

112
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,364
Lovely lady as well.

113
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:03,367
No, no, no... You? You...

114
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:05,736
You're Quinton Canosa?

115
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:07,972
I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.

116
00:10:07,973 --> 00:10:10,307
Okay. Yeah, you got me.

117
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:12,009
I feel like such a fool.

118
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,046
No, no. Please don't.
Well, just a little bit.

119
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,347
I'm so embarrassed.

120
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:17,348
I'm just kidding.

121
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,822
Oh, I don't speak Spanish.

122
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:28,993
Oh, you don't?
Um, I was saying, it, uh...

123
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:30,550
It's a pleasure to meet you.

124
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:36,100
It's an honor to meet you,
Quinton.

125
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:38,002
Yeah. I didn't catch
your name, Ms...

126
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:40,004
Oh. It's Mrs. Zoe Reynard.

127
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,172
Oh.

128
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,340
Oh, Mrs.

129
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,409
Yeah. I see.

130
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,244
God, that always happens, right?

131
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:48,713
The good ones,
they're always taken.

132
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,881
Oh...

133
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:52,318
Oh, thank you.

134
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,121
Uh...

135
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:58,511
I think he's my favorite.

136
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,726
Really?

137
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,068
That's mine.

138
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:19,076
Uh, I don't know if this is
the right place or time

139
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,279
to talk business?

140
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,114
Well, if it's the only way
to keep you next to me...

141
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,187
Um...

142
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,089
Oh, well, uh...
Um, business?

143
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,191
What?

144
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,760
You were gonna
talk about business.

145
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,229
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well, I have a company

146
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,898
and, uh, we represent
contemporary artists.

147
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,433
Oh, wow. That's nice.
Yeah.

148
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,401
Okay, can you tell me about it?

149
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,237
Oh. Yeah, okay, uh...

150
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,439
We would license your work
to the highest bidder,

151
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,443
you know, it could be a classy
advertising campaign,

152
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:57,214
or, um, you know, inspiration
for a clothing line.

153
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:59,784
I mean, you are
an incredible artist, solely,

154
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,920
but we would expand
on that artistry into a brand.

155
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,789
That's nice.

156
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,957
Can you explain that
to me again, please?

157
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,862
Oh, I'm sorry. Spanish...
Am I talking too fast?

158
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,618
I just love to watch
the way your lips move.

159
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:20,437
Um, so, you know,
if you're interested,

160
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:24,308
uh, my office could contact
you and set up a meeting.

161
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:26,877
Okay, um... I don't think...
Uh, you know what?

162
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:29,446
Honestly,
I don't like to be so formal.

163
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,282
Besides, you already know
I'm interested.

164
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,017
So let's do something.

165
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,221
Monday morning. 9:00.
Come to my studio.

166
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,390
Oh! Great.

167
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:41,703
Pleasure to meet you...

168
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,931
Zoe.
Oh, can I call you "Zoe"?

169
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:48,801
Call me Zoe.
Okay.

170
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,372
<i>Meeting Quinton Canosa
just made me realize</i>

171
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:59,210
how much I missed
excitement in my life.

172
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,446
And did you act out
on that feeling?

173
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:04,483
I sure did.

174
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,366
<i>I tried to relive it with Jason.</i>

175
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:26,972
<i>And?</i>

176
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,109
<i>And nothing.</i>

177
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,511
<i>Hello?</i>

178
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:37,381
Hey, handsome.
Are you on your way?

179
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:39,250
Oh, sweetie.

180
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,219
This is gonna be
one of those long nights.

181
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,521
<i>I gotta finish the plans for the
civic center by the weekend</i>

182
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:47,124
<i>and I'm way behind.</i>

183
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,348
We didn't have any plans
tonight, did we?

184
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:52,531
Guess not.

185
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,502
<i>Um, hurry home, okay?</i>

186
00:13:58,503 --> 00:13:59,503
I'll try my best.

187
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,907
<i>But don't wait up, all right?</i>

188
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,475
<i>And kiss the kids for me.</i>

189
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,378
Okay. I will. Love you.

190
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,615
Our love is forever.

191
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,384
Always has been.

192
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:17,121
Always will be.

193
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,624
<i>All right. Sweet dreams.</i>

194
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,311
Oh, hi, Momma.

195
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:44,014
Um, I'm going to the store.
Do you need anything?

196
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:48,052
Hmm. You are definitely going to be the
best-dressed lady in the produce department.

197
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,955
Well,
I got dressed up for Jason.

198
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,424
I'll see you in a minute.

199
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,456
Thank you.

200
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,129
Mmm.

201
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,465
Excuse me.

202
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,435
Hello?

203
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:39,703
Oh. Hi, Mom.

204
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:41,472
<i>Hey, you still at the store?</i>

205
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,276
Um, I'm in the parking lot.
I'm just leaving.

206
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:47,044
Can I get you something?

207
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:49,013
<i>Oh, I don't want you
to have to go back in.</i>

208
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,683
You're probably ready
to hop into bed.

209
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,753
Is that music I hear
in the parking lot?

210
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:59,223
Oh, someone's just blasting
their stereo. Um...

211
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,557
<i>What is it?</i>

212
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:02,192
<i>I don't mind.
I'm already here.</i>

213
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:04,628
I could sure use some
ice cream. I mean, uh...

214
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:07,164
That cookie dough flavor,
if they have it.

215
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,466
Cookie dough ice cream,
coming right up.

216
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:10,601
<i>You sure?</i>

217
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,436
Yes, I'm sure, Mom.

218
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,106
I'll be right there.

219
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,188
Holy shit.

220
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:56,480
Mmm.
Oh!

221
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:57,616
Oh, hi.

222
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,020
Just got home.
Mmm.

223
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:05,357
I couldn't wait
to make it up to you

224
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:08,625
for missing dinner.

225
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:10,561
I'm sorry.

226
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,663
Mmm.

227
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,500
Well, I forgive you.

228
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,204
I love you.
I love you, too.

229
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,727
You look so beautiful
when you sleep.

230
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,344
Mommy!

231
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:36,413
Wake up, sleepyhead!

232
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:38,415
Oh...

233
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,518
Lucky me.
My own personal wake-up call.

234
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,353
You must be hungry.

235
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:44,521
Come on. Let me
make you some breakfast.

236
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:46,356
Dad's already made breakfast.

237
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:47,624
He did?

238
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,326
He made breakfast?
Yeah.

239
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:51,895
Well, let me go see.
I'm so excited.

240
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:53,799
Good morning!
Good morning!

241
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:05,976
Hey, sleepyhead!

242
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,678
Hi!
Good morning!

243
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,513
Good morning.

244
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:10,549
Here we go.

245
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:13,850
For my beautiful wife.

246
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:16,253
There you go. It's hot. Oh.

247
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:17,754
Oh! It is hot. Um...

248
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:19,456
Well, I have to get
the kids to...

249
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,391
I'll take 'em today.
You just enjoy your breakfast.

250
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:22,626
Don't forget this.

251
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:23,961
Thank you.

252
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,729
Good morning, Mom.
You got up late.

253
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,332
Mmm.
Good morning, big boy.

254
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,700
Okay, guys.
Ready for school?

255
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,834
Nope.

256
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,336
Ha-ha! Very funny.
Let's go.

257
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,737
Where's your backpack?
We love school!

258
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:35,939
Yes, we do.
No, we don't.

259
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,574
Have a good day.
I love you.

260
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,443
Our love is forever.

261
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,579
Always has been.
Always will be.

262
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,615
<i>I was watching
the love of my life</i>

263
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,617
<i>take our beautiful children
to school</i>

264
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,730
<i>and all I could think about
was what I was still missing.</i>

265
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,688
<i>It's so strange, you know,</i>

266
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,023
to love someone so much,

267
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:54,960
and still have it
never be enough.

268
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,262
Uh, physically.

269
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,397
So did you feel this way
in other relationships

270
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,798
before you got married?

271
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,268
Well, I wouldn't know.
I never had any.

272
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,902
Jason is the first person

273
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:08,038
you'd ever been with,
until recently?

274
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,740
Yes.

275
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,009
We were high school sweethearts.

276
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,745
We had our first child
a few years later.

277
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,580
And the rest is history.

278
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:19,449
Do you feel that changed
your relationship with Jason?

279
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,018
Yes.

280
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,587
It made us parents.

281
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,790
It's just that I, you know,

282
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,794
always needed something
more in my life.

283
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:33,599
Well, you know, Zoe,
with kids, intimacy changes.

284
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,501
Sometimes you gotta
make time for it.

285
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,603
Yeah.

286
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,638
Not really.

287
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:44,528
Look, we have sex two or three
times a day sometimes.

288
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,413
And I'm still not satisfied.

289
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,048
And if I keep telling him
that I want more,

290
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,849
he's gonna think
I'm a complete freak.

291
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,818
From everything you say,
it sounds like you and Jason

292
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,597
have a very strong relationship.

293
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:00,392
I should've talked to him more.

294
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,864
I should've done a lot
of things, but, instead...

295
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:10,702
Instead, you what?

296
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:17,576
I took my first step
down a terrible path.

297
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,934
Hello?

298
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,106
Hello?

299
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,109
Hello?

300
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:06,089
Zoe?

301
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,798
Did I scare you?

302
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,733
So you live here, too, huh?

303
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:18,702
Oh, yeah.

304
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,370
I actually do everything here.

305
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,708
Some coffee?

306
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:25,911
No, thanks.

307
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,014
Tequila shot?

308
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:33,618
No. No tequila.

309
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:42,159
Uh, my husband would
love your work.

310
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,027
Really?
Yeah, he has a good eye.

311
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:45,697
He's an architect.

312
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,067
Well, he's obviously
a man of taste.

313
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,838
Obviously.

314
00:22:54,572 --> 00:22:55,572
<i>Por favor.</i>

315
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:06,983
Okay.
So down to business.

316
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:08,452
Yes.

317
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,954
Here's what we do
at Zoe & Company.

318
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:13,723
Oh, let me guess. You add me
to your client roster,

319
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:17,194
and then you license my work
to the highest bidder,

320
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,163
and then my stuff ends up
on every calendar,

321
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,566
every coffee mug, lunch box...

322
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,135
I don't know.
Just pretty much everywhere.

323
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:26,970
- You think I'm that crass?
- Wow.

324
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,176
Okay, maybe coffee mugs.

325
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,252
So I believe you have
a contract for me to review?

326
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,522
Uh, yeah.

327
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:45,624
Yeah.

328
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,862
You can go over that
with your attorney

329
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,563
and do all your research
about us, or whatever...

330
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:55,665
Oh, don't worry. I, uh...

331
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,635
I have done
all the research I need.

332
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:00,570
Yeah.

333
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:03,006
Uh...

334
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,208
That's it?
That's it.

335
00:24:05,209 --> 00:24:07,711
Signed, sealed, delivered.

336
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,780
The one and only Quinton
Canosa is my new client?

337
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:12,117
Okay.

338
00:24:18,055 --> 00:24:19,891
I'm all yours.

339
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:23,560
I better go.

340
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:24,663
Zoe...

341
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,632
You, uh... You're not
the first person to ask me

342
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,968
to do the whole
commercial art thing.

343
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:33,770
I've turned down
everyone before.

344
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:35,205
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

345
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:36,929
You wanna know why I chose you?

346
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:39,175
Why?

347
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:41,343
I wanna ask you
for something in return.

348
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:45,116
I want to paint you.

349
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:50,120
Well, I'm flattered, but, uh...

350
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,322
Let me think about that one.

351
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:55,292
Okay, so, I will let my office
formalize our deal

352
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,028
and get back to you.

353
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:01,118
I want to paint you
and put you over my bed.

354
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,803
So that when you're not here,

355
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:09,527
I can satisfy myself
with the mere thought of you.

356
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,545
Uh, I'm flattered, but...

357
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:18,248
I really am. But I can't.
I'm married.

358
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:20,285
So... How do you open
this damn door?

359
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,822
Relax. I know you want it.

360
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:28,126
I can feel it.
I know you want it.

361
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,650
I can't...
This isn't right.

362
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:02,786
It's not right.
Come on, Zoe.

363
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,399
Nothing's ever felt so right.

364
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,238
Oh, yeah.

365
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,675
Oh, God, yes!

366
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:18,528
Boss?

367
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,866
Excuse me?
I was buzzing you.

368
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,145
There's a guy named
Balthazar Crayne on 2.

369
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,505
Um...

370
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,774
Take a message.
You sure?

371
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,042
This guy doesn't sound like he's
used to being kept waiting.

372
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:34,813
Take a message.

373
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:37,148
Got it.

374
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,081
Excuse me, boss.

375
00:29:12,082 --> 00:29:13,483
Excuse me.

376
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:15,051
Oh, I have this. Boss?

377
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:17,522
Can you hang on a sec?
I'll be right back.

378
00:29:20,004 --> 00:29:22,592
Alfred Conteh is freaking
over the coffee mugs.

379
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:24,227
Yeah, I can't deal
with him right now.

380
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:26,262
You all right?
I'm not feeling well.

381
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,331
So I'll be home and just, um,

382
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:29,999
forward me anything
that's urgent.

383
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,168
Is Balthazar Crayne urgent?

384
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,437
His office just
called a third time.

385
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:36,406
Oh. Well,
what's the problem?

386
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,074
Balthazar Crayne!

387
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:40,243
This Balthazar Crayne!

388
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:41,845
He could change our lives.

389
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,913
Take this place
to the next level.

390
00:29:43,914 --> 00:29:45,248
He saw our website.

391
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:47,317
Well, how do you know this guy?

392
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,252
Well, his No. 2
man's assistant

393
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:51,588
is my sister's best friend
from high school.

394
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,123
She introduced me to a guy
who works for his accountant.

395
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:56,459
One drink led to another,
I sent him our website,

396
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,831
and now the Balthazar Crayne
is calling you.

397
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,166
Nice work.

398
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,568
No. "Nice work"
is when I introduce you

399
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:08,338
to an up-and-coming artist.

400
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:12,141
This is "Brina, you are the most freaking
amazing person in the world" level work.

401
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:14,277
So you go back in your office
and you call him.

402
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:16,512
I'll be home, okay?

403
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:19,382
Just tell him that I'll take
him to dinner tomorrow night.

404
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:21,184
And, um, we'll discuss it then.

405
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:23,453
And just make it
someplace expensive.

406
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,022
I pull this off and you
owe me something big.

407
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:27,290
Bentley big!

408
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:28,927
Just please handle it.

409
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,553
Mom?

410
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:33,022
Mom? You're home?

411
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:35,091
Hi, sweetie.

412
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:37,627
I thought you couldn't come to the
game because you were working?

413
00:31:37,628 --> 00:31:39,662
We saw your car in the driveway.
You okay?

414
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:41,965
Uh, bad headache.

415
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,133
Look, I wasn't
feeling well, sweetie.

416
00:31:44,134 --> 00:31:46,302
So I came home early, okay?

417
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:48,571
But I promise I will be there
at the next one.

418
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:50,540
Okay, sweetie? I promise.

419
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,076
Okay. You have to come.

420
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,711
It's the last game
of the season.

421
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,547
You have my word. Got it?

422
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:00,483
Uh, why don't you let Grandma
go get you a snack

423
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:01,684
and go finish your homework?

424
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:02,685
Okay.

425
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,391
Are you sure you're okay?

426
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:10,259
Uh, yeah.

427
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,162
You know, maybe it was
the kids' flu from last week.

428
00:32:13,163 --> 00:32:15,064
I don't know.
I just took some medicine.

429
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,100
Okay.
I'll be down there in a sec.

430
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,268
No, no, no. Rest. I'll get him
started on homework

431
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:21,304
and get Kayla from piano.

432
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:22,707
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

433
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,075
Love you.

434
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:27,188
Love you, too. Okay.

435
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:17,493
Here is the restaurant
address and directions.

436
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:21,497
Balthazar will meet you there
tonight at 7:00 sharp.

437
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:25,387
I had to sell one of my kidneys to
get a reservation, so don't be late.

438
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,104
Hey!

439
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:30,673
Zoe.

440
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:32,243
We need this.
I know.

441
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:07,410
Shane, can you get me a courier?

442
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,780
<i>Sure.
Actually, uh...</i>

443
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:12,014
Never mind. I'll deal with it.

444
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,814
Hey. Are you
looking for Quinton?

445
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:47,450
Um...
He's not home.

446
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:48,786
Left about an hour ago.

447
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,322
Oh. Okay.

448
00:34:53,323 --> 00:34:55,625
Is there something
you wanna leave for him?

449
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,728
You can leave it with me, Zoe.

450
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:00,298
Uh...

451
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,666
No. How do you know my name?

452
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:06,335
Quinton told me all about you.

453
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:08,337
He was right.

454
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:09,707
You're very beautiful.

455
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:16,447
Thank you.
That's very nice.

456
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,529
I'm Diamond,

457
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,832
by the way.

458
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:38,367
Nice to meet you.

459
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,238
Bit of advice, be careful.

460
00:35:41,738 --> 00:35:43,516
Quinton's an artist.
He's very...

461
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:46,709
Sensitive.

462
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,812
Uh...

463
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:50,515
Okay.

464
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,435
Zoe? Zoe!

465
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:16,005
What... What's going on? Are you...
Look, I can't...

466
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:17,640
You all right?
I can't do it.

467
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:19,308
What do you mean?
I can't. I'm sorry.

468
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:20,710
It's not that I don't want to.
Some part of me...

469
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,378
I'd be lying if I said that.

470
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:25,414
But my family,
my kids, my husband...

471
00:36:25,415 --> 00:36:27,950
Look, I...

472
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,253
I never want to force you into
something you don't want to do.

473
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,254
Okay.

474
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:34,690
Thank you.

475
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:35,992
"Thank you"?

476
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,660
Just like that,
thank you? All right.

477
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:39,828
Thank you for understanding.
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:36:46,503 --> 00:36:47,738
Just come here.

479
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:56,646
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
No, no, no. Stop.

480
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:57,848
Please. I can't.

481
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:04,222
I'll make you a deal.

482
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:07,625
Just give me an hour.

483
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:10,626
What?

484
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:12,127
I wanna show you something.

485
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,753
I wanna show you
something special.

486
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,535
I bet you do.

487
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:21,036
I'm not talking about that.

488
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:24,942
It's just, um, some art.

489
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,845
After that, you can
go home if you want to.

490
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:32,783
One hour.

491
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:36,754
Okay, one hour.
Promise.

492
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:39,044
Just one condition.

493
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:42,858
Condition?
Turn around for me.

494
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,093
Turn...
Yes, turn around for me.

495
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:45,094
Come on.
No.

496
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,630
Come on.

497
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,337
Quinton...
Relax.

498
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,541
Quinton...
Just relax.

499
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:03,079
Where are we going?

500
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,282
Trust me.

501
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:32,943
Come here.

502
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:37,648
Watch your head.

503
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,719
Careful.

504
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:46,924
Quinton, where are we?

505
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,461
I want your first look
to be perfect. Hmm?

506
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:54,332
My first look at what?

507
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:57,401
Enough. What is it?

508
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,410
It's beautiful.

509
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,949
I started it when I was 11.

510
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,454
And I've never shown
this to anyone before.

511
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,097
Well, is, um,
that you and your family?

512
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:30,132
No, no.

513
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:32,701
That's the family I wanted.

514
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:34,647
When I was
nine years old, my mom...

515
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:37,975
She ran off with another man.

516
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:40,978
We never saw her again.

517
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:45,049
I'm so sorry.

518
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:49,820
Broke my father's heart.

519
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:52,790
He took a gun,

520
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,070
put it in his mouth.

521
00:39:57,894 --> 00:39:59,563
Oh, my God.

522
00:40:00,797 --> 00:40:02,032
I know...

523
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,703
I know things happen
in a marriage,

524
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:09,038
but for a mother
to just leave her child

525
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,874
and never look back, that's...

526
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,746
I can never get over that.

527
00:40:19,149 --> 00:40:21,851
Oh, Quinton...

528
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,241
I know this is all wrong.

529
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:27,801
I know I'm not supposed to...

530
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:31,192
To be with another
man's wife, but...

531
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:34,765
Zoe, I can't help it.

532
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,646
Thanks, Mr. Crayne.

533
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:38,227
Balthazar!
Mr. Crayne! Wait!

534
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:40,162
Wait, wait, wait!

535
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:41,830
Hi.

536
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:44,900
I'm Zoe. I am so sorry.

537
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:47,236
Please don't go.

538
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:49,672
Look, I would
completely understand

539
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,774
if you were furious with me
for being so rude

540
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,042
and didn't wanna have anything
to do with me,

541
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,545
but please hear me out.

542
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:57,346
I am always on time.

543
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,882
But my daughter Kayla
was sick tonight

544
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:02,618
and I took her to the doctor,

545
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:04,753
and I just lost track of time.

546
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:05,754
I apologize.

547
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,858
I'm on a red-eye to Paris.

548
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:10,995
And you

549
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,575
should call my office
to reschedule.

550
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:18,702
Thank you for understanding.

551
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:22,605
I hope your daughter
feels better.

552
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,008
Have a safe trip.

553
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:31,780
<i>I totally lost track of time
when I was with Quinton.</i>

554
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:33,917
I keep using my kid
as an excuse.

555
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:38,387
I said my daughter was sick.

556
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:41,692
God, you don't wanna
put that out in the universe.

557
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:46,196
This is making me crazy.
I'm... I'm so messed up.

558
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,766
And this obsession...

559
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:53,135
I know, I know that
it's ruining my life.

560
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:56,405
It's terrible.
But I keep going back.

561
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:58,741
So how long have you been
meeting him now?

562
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,943
Oh, months.

563
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:02,279
Every day, if I can.

564
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:09,018
Oh, God!

565
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,687
Oh. Well, thank you so much,

566
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:14,089
uh, but I, uh...
I better hurry.

567
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,358
If I hurry, I can actually
get the kids to bed.

568
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:18,160
First time since Monday night.

569
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,295
Zoe...

570
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:22,965
Let's make some time
for next week.

571
00:43:22,966 --> 00:43:24,933
Yeah, it's just that,
you know...

572
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:27,703
I have to see if I have,
well, the time.

573
00:43:27,704 --> 00:43:30,072
You know, with the kids
and work and Jason...

574
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:33,351
See, coming here is just one
more thing that I have to hide.

575
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,947
When can I see it?

576
00:43:38,948 --> 00:43:40,215
When it's finished.

577
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:41,605
When will it be finished?

578
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,821
You don't like waiting
for anything, do you?

579
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:48,045
I thought that's what
you liked about me.

580
00:43:49,092 --> 00:43:51,293
You know what? Um...

581
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:53,797
Your chin...

582
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:57,635
No, no...

583
00:43:58,835 --> 00:43:59,835
Just hold on.

584
00:44:02,205 --> 00:44:05,140
Zoe, Zoe... Come here.

585
00:44:05,141 --> 00:44:07,177
Let me see.
Come here.

586
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,880
There you go. Just hold it.
There. Okay...

587
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:13,215
Zoe, what are you doing?

588
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:19,323
You're a model.
Models keep still. Okay?

589
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:22,693
What are you doing?

590
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,228
You're not helping me here.

591
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:28,864
I don't like following orders.

592
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:30,034
Zoe...

593
00:45:10,106 --> 00:45:11,375
Quinton?

594
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,901
That would be cheating.

595
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:20,444
Curiosity killed the cat.

596
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:28,016
Who are they?

597
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:29,853
Some women I used to know.

598
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,958
This one...

599
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,495
It's so disturbing.

600
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:44,334
Well, I, um...
I paint what I feel.

601
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:52,576
She's still stunning.

602
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,348
They're all so beautiful.

603
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,349
Are you jealous?

604
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:03,487
No. I...

605
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:10,193
I have no right to be.

606
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,095
Zoe, come on.

607
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,129
It's so funny.
It's so funny.

608
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,198
This is crazy.

609
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:18,233
What the hell am I doing here?

610
00:47:18,234 --> 00:47:20,936
What are you doing here?
I mean...

611
00:47:20,937 --> 00:47:22,671
I think we both know
the answer to that one.

612
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:24,506
Yeah, do we?

613
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:26,408
Hmm?

614
00:47:26,409 --> 00:47:27,943
Yeah, we...
We know the answer?

615
00:47:27,944 --> 00:47:29,945
Yeah, we do.
Are you sure I'm not just

616
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:32,581
another one of your women that
you've lured into your lair?

617
00:47:32,582 --> 00:47:34,383
What's wrong with you?
Zoe, come on.

618
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,184
They're just paintings from
a long time ago, I told you.

619
00:47:36,185 --> 00:47:37,219
Come on.

620
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,487
I better go.

621
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,057
Are you serious?

622
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:44,059
I don't belong here.

623
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,394
You do...

624
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:48,063
You belong here, Zoe.
You know that.

625
00:47:48,064 --> 00:47:50,299
Don't say that.

626
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,435
'Cause nobody... Nobody has
ever made me feel this way.

627
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:55,372
Talk this way. Seen my soul.

628
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,948
Okay, trap it.
First, trap it.

629
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,016
Don't plant your foot too early.

630
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:09,518
Mommy!

631
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:10,585
Put it right next
to the ball, look.

632
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:11,987
Hey, honey!
How'd it go?

633
00:48:11,988 --> 00:48:13,488
They won!
They did?

634
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:14,990
Oh, you should have seen him!

635
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:16,124
Saved the day.

636
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,226
Oh, wow! Our star player!

637
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:20,062
Congratulations!

638
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,297
That's right.
You promised!

639
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:23,632
Um...
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

640
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:25,367
Peter, I'm sorry.
I had to work.

641
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:26,568
What happened?

642
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:28,437
Uh... Client crisis.

643
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,374
Hey, how's my best girl?

644
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,709
Momma's a Smurf! Look!

645
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,477
You've got blue hair!

646
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:37,346
Hmm.

647
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,414
Oh! How'd
that get there?

648
00:48:39,415 --> 00:48:41,583
Occupational hazard, huh?

649
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:45,153
Can I get blue hair, too?
Please?

650
00:48:45,154 --> 00:48:47,089
Come on, stop yanking
on your momma.

651
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,623
Come on. Come here,
silly banana.

652
00:48:48,624 --> 00:48:50,425
Have some hot chocolate.

653
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:52,060
Sit down.

654
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:54,129
You want some?
Yeah, thank you.

655
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:57,666
Hey. I'm sorry.
All right?

656
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:00,737
Careful. Look at you.

657
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,339
Messy Bessie. Here.

658
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,708
<i>I was gonna tell him.</i>

659
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:08,777
<i>Swear to God.
Good?</i>

660
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:11,181
<i>I just couldn't.</i>

661
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:16,353
It would destroy my family,
my life.

662
00:49:18,187 --> 00:49:20,622
I'm sick. I'm really sick.

663
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:24,227
Zoe, this is an obvious sign
of addiction here.

664
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:28,463
Addiction?

665
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:29,765
I'm not on drugs.

666
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,768
No, you can't smoke it,
shoot it, or snort it.

667
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:36,138
But make no mistake,
sex can be a drug, too.

668
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,306
It's as powerful
as any narcotic.

669
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:40,042
Oh, come on. That's crazy.

670
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,343
No, sexual addiction,

671
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:44,513
it's not as common
as alcoholism or drugs.

672
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,349
But it is a very real problem

673
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,785
that thousands of people
are battling each day.

674
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:53,255
Your first time with a lover
outside of your marriage

675
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,791
is like your
first hit of heroin.

676
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,627
The thrill of the illicit.

677
00:49:58,828 --> 00:50:00,762
Then you keep craving it.

678
00:50:00,763 --> 00:50:02,799
Okay. Well,
then what do I do?

679
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,101
Because I come here to see you,

680
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:07,335
and we talk and we talk,
and we talk.

681
00:50:07,336 --> 00:50:09,571
But what's the solution?

682
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:12,841
I need help! What's the plan?

683
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:17,412
Now, you said that you tried
talking to Jason before.

684
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:20,515
I think that you should suggest
to him couples counseling.

685
00:50:20,516 --> 00:50:23,572
Then he'll know there's a real
problem in your marriage.

686
00:50:24,153 --> 00:50:25,222
Okay.

687
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,225
I'll give it a shot.

688
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,301
I didn't know
you got a new cell phone.

689
00:51:13,302 --> 00:51:15,637
Oh. Uh...

690
00:51:15,638 --> 00:51:18,406
Crayne, Balthazar Crayne,
you know, that investor guy.

691
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:19,741
One of his companies sells them

692
00:51:19,742 --> 00:51:22,410
and they gave them out
as promos.

693
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:23,745
That's pretty snazzy.

694
00:51:23,746 --> 00:51:25,280
Oops.

695
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:27,816
Oh. Here, I'll take it.
That's okay.

696
00:51:27,817 --> 00:51:30,762
I think that's your new
millionaire boyfriend calling.

697
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,859
Oh, please. Yeah.
That's all I need in my life.

698
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,461
Another man.

699
00:51:39,462 --> 00:51:41,530
You are all the man that I need.

700
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,300
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

701
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,402
Mmm.

702
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,741
What's on your mind, baby?

703
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:53,777
Hmm?

704
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:57,445
Uh...

705
00:51:57,446 --> 00:51:59,214
Yeah, you know, actually,

706
00:51:59,215 --> 00:52:02,184
there is a problem
that we should talk about.

707
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,186
A problem?
Mmm-hmm.

708
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,655
What's the problem?

709
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,823
Maybe you and I
should talk to somebody.

710
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:11,860
Talk to who? About what?

711
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:15,565
Uh, a professional,
about our... Our sex life.

712
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,771
What's wrong... What's wrong
with our sex life?

713
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:25,607
Wait, hold on. What do
you mean by "a professional"?

714
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:28,610
You know, a therapist.

715
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:33,215
I'm not gonna talk
to a shrink about anything.

716
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,884
Especially not
our personal affairs.

717
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:37,686
Half of those people are crooks.

718
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,387
That's ridiculous.

719
00:52:39,388 --> 00:52:41,389
No, no. Ridiculous is
the money they spend

720
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,959
on some fake doctor
to listen to their problems.

721
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,561
Wow. I didn't know you
hated an entire profession.

722
00:52:46,562 --> 00:52:48,563
Look, sweetie,

723
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:52,367
we have always talked
about everything, right?

724
00:52:52,368 --> 00:52:55,470
Why would we need to bring
somebody in, a total stranger,

725
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:57,639
and have them
get in between us? Hmm?

726
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,274
Jason, why aren't you
listening to me?

727
00:52:59,275 --> 00:53:01,543
I mean, I think that...
You know, maybe...

728
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:04,312
Listen to you, listen to you.
...it would be a good...

729
00:53:04,313 --> 00:53:05,914
Come here, sweetie.

730
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:08,552
You're exhausted.
You work too hard.

731
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,687
All right, we both do.

732
00:53:12,688 --> 00:53:14,522
Tell you what.

733
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:17,525
Why don't we go to that
French place on Saturday?

734
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:20,595
The one you like.
With the candles.

735
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:23,632
Have some wine, hmm?
Mmm.

736
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,900
Yes. Um...

737
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:27,124
I need to take a walk.

738
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:32,507
Okay, that's a good idea.
Get some fresh air.

739
00:53:32,508 --> 00:53:34,909
I'll finish up.

740
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:36,022
Our love is forever.

741
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:43,853
Always has been.

742
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:46,656
Always will be.

743
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:09,477
Wow.

744
00:54:09,478 --> 00:54:11,915
Quinton, that was great.
I needed that.

745
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,253
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

746
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:20,991
Mmm...

747
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,563
You okay?

748
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:29,564
Yeah, I'm okay.

749
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,734
I'm okay.

750
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:34,636
Actually...

751
00:54:34,637 --> 00:54:38,707
Actually, I'm not okay.
I'm not okay. I, uh...

752
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:39,941
I think we need to talk.

753
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:41,343
Talk about what?

754
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,078
About us.
About the whole thing.

755
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,480
I mean, it has been great
and everything, but...

756
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:47,417
But what?

757
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:49,884
Leave him.

758
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,655
Leave your husband
and be with me.

759
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,694
I can't.

760
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:01,629
You can't? Why the hell not?
I can't.

761
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,631
I can't leave Jason.
Tell me, tell me why not.

762
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:04,999
Tell me. I wanna know.

763
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,902
Because Jason's my life.

764
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:09,904
Yeah, and that's why you're here
with me every chance you get?

765
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:12,674
Oh, Quinton, come on,
you knew that I was married when we met.

766
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:14,442
What'd you expect?

767
00:55:14,443 --> 00:55:16,478
I didn't expect anything.
I don't know what to expect.

768
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,257
I didn't expect to fall
in love with you and I did!

769
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,984
And I know
you've thought about it.

770
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:25,653
I look at you and I see it.
I feel it.

771
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:27,599
It's more than
just sex to you, too.

772
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:29,526
I can't!

773
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:34,364
I have two kids!
I have a family. I can't.

774
00:56:03,826 --> 00:56:06,528
I want to have a family, too.

775
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,997
With you.

776
00:56:43,098 --> 00:56:44,866
<i>He changed the rules on me.</i>

777
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:46,234
<i>He wasn't supposed to do that.</i>

778
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:48,837
He changed the rules?

779
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,205
Okay. We both did.

780
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:51,940
Hmm.

781
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:54,909
But, I mean,
Jason wasn't listening.

782
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,478
Damn, Quinton was right.

783
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:58,079
I could picture myself with him.

784
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,647
How does that
make you feel, Zoe?

785
00:56:59,648 --> 00:57:01,950
Like I was cheating
with my heart.

786
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,018
Which is not what
I signed on for.

787
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:05,787
This is not what I need.

788
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:07,123
What do you need?

789
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:04,245
Oh, yeah?
You want it in?

790
00:58:04,246 --> 00:58:05,882
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

791
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,972
Come on.

792
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,176
Yeah, you like that? Huh?

793
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:51,626
My name is Corey.

794
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:54,262
Mmm.

795
00:58:54,263 --> 00:58:57,165
<i>I've never done it
like that before.</i>

796
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:00,002
I enjoyed every minute of it.

797
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:03,638
Is there medication?

798
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:06,341
You know, some kind of pill
that you can prescribe?

799
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:08,843
Oh, Lord.
I even sound like an addict.

800
00:59:08,844 --> 00:59:10,878
You know that
we never really got a chance

801
00:59:10,879 --> 00:59:12,914
to talk about
your childhood in Dallas,

802
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:15,249
before you moved to Atlanta.

803
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,285
Oh, I don't remember
any of that.

804
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:20,121
You were 10 years old
when you moved, right?

805
00:59:20,122 --> 00:59:22,090
I'm telling you,
I don't remember anything.

806
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,791
Jason teases me about it.

807
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:26,928
He says it's because
my life began when I met him.

808
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:28,485
So when'd you get that scar?

809
00:59:29,765 --> 00:59:32,767
Was that before Atlanta?

810
00:59:32,768 --> 00:59:34,769
Uh...
God, I've always had this.

811
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,337
Why? What does it matter?

812
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:39,941
Because, Zoe, the past can help
us understand the present.

813
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:43,277
So we really do need
to explore every avenue,

814
00:59:43,278 --> 00:59:45,001
in order to help make you well.

815
00:59:47,282 --> 00:59:50,785
Oh. I gotta go.

816
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:53,923
Listen, I will try to remember
more, for next week.

817
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:59,295
I do wanna get better.

818
01:00:00,362 --> 01:00:02,397
And you will.

819
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:03,866
Oh!

820
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,383
You like that?

821
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:24,352
Oh, God, yes.

822
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:25,820
What do you like about it?

823
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:27,323
Everything.

824
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,908
Zoe?

825
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:50,411
Zoe?

826
01:00:50,412 --> 01:00:51,979
Come in.

827
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:54,015
Zoe...

828
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:55,149
You all right?

829
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,118
Um...

830
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:01,022
Oh, there's just something going
around at the kids' school.

831
01:01:01,023 --> 01:01:02,125
What's up?

832
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:07,061
We need to go over
the numbers for this quarter,

833
01:01:07,062 --> 01:01:08,285
and they are not good.

834
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,035
Here...

835
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:32,889
Quinton?

836
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:39,827
Hmm.

837
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:49,481
<i>Little busy.
Just leave it at the beep.</i>

838
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:51,939
Hey, it's me.

839
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:54,208
I see your car downstairs,
but I don't see you.

840
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:55,912
Where are you?

841
01:02:15,397 --> 01:02:16,831
Oh, shit!

842
01:02:16,832 --> 01:02:18,110
Hey, you wanna join us?

843
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,228
What's wrong with her?

844
01:02:24,973 --> 01:02:26,140
Zoe, listen to me.

845
01:02:26,141 --> 01:02:28,242
Don't touch me, you pig!

846
01:02:28,243 --> 01:02:30,311
Can we talk it over, please?

847
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:32,313
Why don't you talk it over with
your little trick over there, huh?

848
01:02:32,314 --> 01:02:35,082
Bitch! I don't even know
what's going on with you two.

849
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,450
I don't wanna know.

850
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:38,386
I mean, you can stay
and watch if you want.

851
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:39,554
Zoe, I know it's fucked up,
but, please...

852
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,889
This whole thing is fucked up!

853
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:43,292
This whole thing is fucked up!

854
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:44,842
Yeah, you know what?
You're absolutely right!

855
01:02:45,042 --> 01:02:45,993
It's fucked up completely!

856
01:02:45,994 --> 01:02:47,395
'Cause you get to go
to your husband every night.

857
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,596
And what? What do you
expect me to do, Zoe?

858
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:49,964
Just wait here for you?
Is that what...

859
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:51,465
Is that what you want me to do?

860
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:53,134
Zoe, I'm talking to you!
What do you want me to do?

861
01:02:53,135 --> 01:02:54,936
Come here, Zoe.

862
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,904
Listen, Zoe.

863
01:02:56,905 --> 01:02:59,407
Zoe, I asked you to be with me.

864
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,609
I asked you.

865
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,277
What do you want me to do?

866
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:04,879
Tell me. Whatever you
want me to do, I'll do it.

867
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,147
What do you want?

868
01:03:06,148 --> 01:03:08,117
What the fuck
did you want from me?

869
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:11,921
Nothing.

870
01:03:13,288 --> 01:03:14,733
I don't want a damn thing.

871
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,305
Hi, baby.

872
01:03:31,406 --> 01:03:32,541
What's wrong?

873
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,824
You okay?

874
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:53,296
What's going on?

875
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:58,566
Just... Bad day.

876
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:01,901
Hey, you know if you're in
trouble, you can always stay here.

877
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:07,108
I feel we have a connection.

878
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:09,276
Hmm. So you know I got
your back, right?

879
01:04:10,078 --> 01:04:11,301
I'll take care of you.

880
01:04:12,314 --> 01:04:13,314
I'm okay.

881
01:04:16,618 --> 01:04:18,386
Just fuck me.

882
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,587
Oh, that's what you want, huh?

883
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:20,655
Mmm-hmm.

884
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:21,768
Yeah, you like that.

885
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:23,925
Oh, yeah.

886
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:27,628
Slide back, baby.

887
01:04:27,629 --> 01:04:29,497
Let me get up there
and do that for you.

888
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,300
I'll give it to you all day.

889
01:04:42,978 --> 01:04:44,278
Choke me.

890
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:45,613
You like that?

891
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:46,892
You like it, don't you?

892
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,519
Yeah.

893
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:15,544
Good night, Mommy.
Good night, sweetie.

894
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,048
Okay.
Good night, Mom.

895
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:22,450
Good night.

896
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,518
I think I'm a little too old
to be tucked in.

897
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:26,188
Okay.

898
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,412
Momma, I'll be back.

899
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,648
Oh, yeah.

900
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,084
Yes!

901
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:28,649
Uh-huh.

902
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,284
Open up.

903
01:06:30,285 --> 01:06:31,420
There you go.

904
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:36,125
Yeah! Harder.

905
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:56,712
You try it.

906
01:06:57,846 --> 01:06:59,213
No.

907
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:00,448
Go ahead.

908
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,116
Are you sure?

909
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:03,395
Yeah, baby, just do it.

910
01:07:13,128 --> 01:07:14,130
Ah!

911
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:21,335
Don't stop.

912
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:11,287
You've missed
every single soccer game.

913
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:18,394
Kayla's asking
where you go at night.

914
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,663
I tried explaining to her,
but I couldn't.

915
01:08:22,664 --> 01:08:24,553
So, maybe
you can explain it to me.

916
01:08:28,139 --> 01:08:30,838
Why? You're the only person
allowed to work late?

917
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:35,242
I work. I don't disappear.

918
01:08:35,243 --> 01:08:36,844
Do you know how many nights
that I've stayed up

919
01:08:36,845 --> 01:08:38,179
waiting up for you?

920
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,280
Oh, I'm in my office.

921
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,215
I answer your calls.

922
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:42,616
You always know where I am.

923
01:08:42,617 --> 01:08:44,652
I don't know anything.

924
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:45,753
I don't know
what you do at work.

925
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:47,521
I don't know who you talk to.

926
01:08:47,522 --> 01:08:49,390
I don't know what
you're doing with them.

927
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:51,759
I mean, I work, too, Jason.

928
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,629
I mean, what?

929
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:56,363
My work's not as important,

930
01:08:56,364 --> 01:08:57,765
because I don't make
as much money as you?

931
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,301
Okay, stop it!

932
01:09:00,702 --> 01:09:03,304
This is about the kids.
Is it?

933
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,239
No, I think this is about us.

934
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,629
I think we should talk
about what's missing.

935
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:12,379
What's missing?

936
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,215
Okay, let me see.
We got a beautiful home,

937
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,652
beautiful kids,
we got great careers.

938
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:19,987
What the hell else do you want?

939
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:22,433
Yeah, everything's perfect.
Look, I want you.

940
01:09:23,992 --> 01:09:26,293
I want more from you.

941
01:09:26,294 --> 01:09:28,362
I mean, I want you to loosen up.

942
01:09:28,363 --> 01:09:31,030
You know? If you just
loosened up, and I could...

943
01:09:32,834 --> 01:09:35,436
I could take us
to places that is just...

944
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:39,373
That's just so amazing.

945
01:09:39,374 --> 01:09:41,375
Hmm?

946
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:44,713
I mean, you know,
we could try new things...

947
01:09:46,014 --> 01:09:47,583
Experiment.

948
01:09:49,584 --> 01:09:51,584
You know?
Okay, who the hell are you?

949
01:09:53,701 --> 01:09:55,456
I'm your wife!
No, no, no, no...

950
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,558
My wife tells me
when something is wrong.

951
01:09:57,559 --> 01:09:59,460
I tried.
My wife... My wife

952
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,929
tells me about her day,
makes time for her family,

953
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:03,530
and she doesn't get
a fancy new cell phone

954
01:10:03,531 --> 01:10:05,768
and then lie about it.
And what is this?

955
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:09,270
Condoms?
I...

956
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:10,704
We never use condoms!

957
01:10:10,705 --> 01:10:12,673
You went through my bag?

958
01:10:12,674 --> 01:10:15,452
Since when do you care
if I see what's in your bag?

959
01:10:16,344 --> 01:10:18,946
Jason, I told you that
I went to the doctor.

960
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:20,714
I wasn't feeling well,
and so we...

961
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:21,771
I got off the pill.

962
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,727
Okay, look...

963
01:10:33,728 --> 01:10:36,098
You know I would do
anything for you, right?

964
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:38,332
Okay?

965
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:40,401
I love you
more than life itself.

966
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,403
You can talk to me.

967
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:43,739
Yeah, well...

968
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,574
You could do me right here.

969
01:10:47,575 --> 01:10:49,076
What?

970
01:10:49,077 --> 01:10:50,978
Do me right here.

971
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:52,591
Come on. The kids are asleep.

972
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,952
You don't get it, do you?

973
01:10:58,453 --> 01:10:59,455
Okay.

974
01:11:00,655 --> 01:11:02,990
I want my wife back.

975
01:11:02,991 --> 01:11:04,827
I'm right here.

976
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:47,970
What's going on?

977
01:11:51,706 --> 01:11:52,841
Okay...

978
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:06,453
Uh, word is

979
01:12:06,454 --> 01:12:08,524
Preston Ellis
is going over to ARC.

980
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,725
Well, get him
on the phone. I'll try and...

981
01:12:11,726 --> 01:12:13,694
There's more.

982
01:12:13,695 --> 01:12:16,597
Both Kanisha Wylie and
Rob Diaz are going with him.

983
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,732
Oh, damn it.

984
01:12:18,733 --> 01:12:21,468
And I think that's a letter from
Alfred Conteh's lawyer on your desk.

985
01:12:21,469 --> 01:12:24,104
He's suddenly decided he
doesn't need representation.

986
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,407
Oh, well, forget him.
He's an idiot.

987
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:27,408
Is he?

988
01:12:29,911 --> 01:12:31,745
What? What's your problem?

989
01:12:31,746 --> 01:12:33,547
My problem?

990
01:12:33,548 --> 01:12:35,416
Oh, well, let's see.

991
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:39,887
I have no life, because
I work my ass off 24/7,

992
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:41,989
to keep a company
going for a boss

993
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:45,426
who hasn't given a shit about
the business for months now.

994
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:46,827
And now I'm trying to figure out

995
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:48,695
how I'm gonna make my rent.

996
01:12:48,696 --> 01:12:50,063
Because my boss,

997
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:53,834
who is also supposed
to be my best friend,

998
01:12:53,835 --> 01:12:56,837
can't even see that we might
not make payroll next week.

999
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:58,227
How's that for a problem?

1000
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:08,115
I'm tapped out. We're done.

1001
01:13:08,116 --> 01:13:09,850
Mmm-mmm, no.

1002
01:13:09,851 --> 01:13:11,887
You don't get to give up now.

1003
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:17,925
You know, I came to work here
because I believed in you.

1004
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:20,027
You were a visionary.

1005
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:22,463
The girl who could...
Who could spot talent

1006
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:25,799
in a kid painting
on the side of a building.

1007
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,469
If anyone can fix this, you can.

1008
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,537
But you need to act.

1009
01:13:30,538 --> 01:13:32,139
Do what you do best.

1010
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:35,609
Bring in that big artist.
Have that great idea.

1011
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,644
You know, this is it, Zoe.

1012
01:13:37,645 --> 01:13:39,648
Sink or swim.
It is up to you.

1013
01:13:41,173 --> 01:13:42,983
And I will do anything you need.

1014
01:13:42,984 --> 01:13:45,120
But do not just disappear on me.

1015
01:14:38,206 --> 01:14:39,262
So where do I sign?

1016
01:14:48,816 --> 01:14:51,752
I'm just kidding.

1017
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:54,531
I'm happy to have you back,
whatever the reason is.

1018
01:15:03,231 --> 01:15:04,698
Who is it?

1019
01:15:04,699 --> 01:15:05,699
Oh, they're early.

1020
01:15:13,341 --> 01:15:15,309
Hey, Quinton.
Hey, man.

1021
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,144
Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

1022
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,279
Ed and Aaron are gonna
meet us at the restaurant.

1023
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,149
But I don't believe you've met our
chief architect, Mr. Jason Reynard.

1024
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,684
Pleasure.

1025
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,086
Mr. Jason.
All right.

1026
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,088
Pleasure to meet you, man. Yeah.

1027
01:15:28,089 --> 01:15:29,323
Since you'll be doing the mural,

1028
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,258
I wanted Jason
to see your work firsthand.

1029
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:32,759
Yeah, no problem.
Of course.

1030
01:15:36,522 --> 01:15:38,832
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I have to take this.

1031
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,235
This is Benny. Yep.

1032
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:44,638
Wow.

1033
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:46,773
You're talented.

1034
01:15:46,774 --> 01:15:49,009
Thank you.

1035
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:50,112
Whoa, this is...

1036
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:53,315
This is... It's beautiful.

1037
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:02,624
It's disturbing.

1038
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,326
Disturbing...

1039
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:07,327
Yeah.
Hmm.

1040
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:12,799
I love it.

1041
01:16:15,661 --> 01:16:18,138
You know, my wife,
she would love your stuff.

1042
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:19,139
Really?
Mmm.

1043
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,707
She represents artists.

1044
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,986
Started her own agency
from the ground up.

1045
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:25,312
Wow, that's nice.
Hmm.

1046
01:16:25,313 --> 01:16:28,048
I'm gonna get you
a card for her.

1047
01:16:28,049 --> 01:16:31,219
She's got a great eye,
and she's a marketing genius.

1048
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:36,255
I'm sure she could make you
a mint in reproductions.

1049
01:17:05,987 --> 01:17:08,789
Jason?

1050
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,024
We should get going.
Our reservations are for 6:30.

1051
01:17:11,025 --> 01:17:12,926
All right.

1052
01:17:12,927 --> 01:17:14,728
Let's go.

1053
01:17:14,729 --> 01:17:16,863
Let's go celebrate
and have some drinks.

1054
01:17:16,864 --> 01:17:17,864
Well...

1055
01:17:20,935 --> 01:17:23,238
All right. Nice.

1056
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,914
I gotta handle
something real quick.

1057
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:35,217
Meet you guys in a few.

1058
01:17:44,258 --> 01:17:45,360
All right.

1059
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:59,141
You weren't gonna
stop him, were you?

1060
01:18:06,013 --> 01:18:09,117
Here. I... I gotta go.

1061
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,387
Have a dinner with a client.

1062
01:18:43,818 --> 01:18:45,952
I'm ready to go.
Come on.

1063
01:18:45,953 --> 01:18:47,854
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

1064
01:18:47,855 --> 01:18:49,911
I don't wanna miss
the previews, guys.

1065
01:18:53,861 --> 01:18:55,295
I wanna do it myself!

1066
01:18:55,296 --> 01:18:57,063
Jesus, Kayla, okay,
look, you know,

1067
01:18:57,064 --> 01:18:58,431
the movies are gonna start
with or without us, guys.

1068
01:18:58,432 --> 01:18:59,466
I know.
It's up to you.

1069
01:18:59,467 --> 01:19:00,934
Hey, where are you guys going?

1070
01:19:00,935 --> 01:19:02,302
Some new Disney thing at Phipps.

1071
01:19:02,303 --> 01:19:04,037
We didn't think
you'd wanna come.

1072
01:19:04,038 --> 01:19:06,239
Course not.

1073
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,475
I wanna come.
You can have my ticket.

1074
01:19:08,476 --> 01:19:10,544
You better hurry, the movie
starts in 15 minutes.

1075
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:13,146
Oh, great. Now we're gonna
miss the movie because of you.

1076
01:19:13,147 --> 01:19:14,281
I don't wanna miss the movie!

1077
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:15,882
We're not gonna miss the movie!

1078
01:19:15,883 --> 01:19:18,451
Just put your shoe on, Kayla.
Come on.

1079
01:19:18,452 --> 01:19:20,887
No, it's fine.
You guys go ahead.

1080
01:19:20,888 --> 01:19:22,889
You sure?
Yeah.

1081
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:25,892
Have fun. I'll make cookies
for when you get back.

1082
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:27,260
Cookies!
Yay! Cookies.

1083
01:19:27,261 --> 01:19:28,361
Bye, Peter.
All right.

1084
01:19:28,362 --> 01:19:30,096
See you in a couple hours.

1085
01:19:30,097 --> 01:19:31,464
Hey, Kayla, you know
I'm in the front, right?

1086
01:19:31,465 --> 01:19:32,743
Whatever.
Just whatever.

1087
01:19:44,145 --> 01:19:46,112
<i>So how did that make you
feel, being left alone?</i>

1088
01:19:46,113 --> 01:19:48,181
Horrible.

1089
01:19:48,182 --> 01:19:50,116
Like I lost my family.

1090
01:19:50,117 --> 01:19:52,395
Zoe, we need to talk
about your childhood.

1091
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:57,025
You know what, Dr. Spencer?

1092
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,293
This is not working for me.

1093
01:20:00,294 --> 01:20:03,196
What is it about your past
that scares you so much?

1094
01:20:03,197 --> 01:20:04,564
See, there you go again.

1095
01:20:04,565 --> 01:20:07,169
All the same questions.
No answers.

1096
01:20:08,449 --> 01:20:10,537
You just sit there,
100 bucks an hour,

1097
01:20:10,538 --> 01:20:13,273
and all you do is ask
the same stupid questions!

1098
01:20:13,274 --> 01:20:14,941
And nothing changes!

1099
01:20:14,942 --> 01:20:17,911
It's okay for you
to be frustrated.

1100
01:20:17,912 --> 01:20:20,413
Or scared.

1101
01:20:20,414 --> 01:20:23,283
But you have got to take
control over your life now,

1102
01:20:23,284 --> 01:20:26,386
before this addiction ruins it.

1103
01:20:26,387 --> 01:20:28,955
You need to confront
your lovers,

1104
01:20:28,956 --> 01:20:31,324
call it quits
and go cold turkey.

1105
01:20:31,325 --> 01:20:33,994
And then you can begin
to claim your life back.

1106
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:35,295
It may sound like a lot,

1107
01:20:35,296 --> 01:20:37,564
but I promise you
it will be okay.

1108
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:39,601
It's not okay!
None of this is okay!

1109
01:20:41,402 --> 01:20:43,303
You know what?
Jason was right.

1110
01:20:43,304 --> 01:20:45,105
People need to handle
their own damn problems.

1111
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,440
Paying you to listen to me
is not the solution.

1112
01:20:47,441 --> 01:20:49,075
Then what's the solution?

1113
01:20:49,076 --> 01:20:51,177
I need to sort this out
on my own. Thank you.

1114
01:20:51,178 --> 01:20:54,347
Zoe, you can't keep
running from your past.

1115
01:20:54,348 --> 01:20:56,349
Because sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up with you.

1116
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:57,628
You can't keep running!

1117
01:20:59,954 --> 01:21:01,588
What the hell?
Thank you.

1118
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:03,258
Have a good day.
You, too.

1119
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:45,300
What did he want?

1120
01:21:48,602 --> 01:21:50,170
Slow down, honey.

1121
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:51,604
You're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

1122
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:53,039
Momma!

1123
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,374
What did that man want?

1124
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:56,678
He was a messenger.
You have a package.

1125
01:22:02,049 --> 01:22:03,316
Ugh!

1126
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:05,317
What is it, honey?
What's the matter?

1127
01:22:06,153 --> 01:22:08,021
It's fine.
Are the kids inside?

1128
01:22:08,022 --> 01:22:10,689
Of course. They're upstairs
doing their homework.

1129
01:22:11,158 --> 01:22:12,659
What is it?

1130
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,827
Do you wanna talk
to me about something?

1131
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:18,300
Oh... Momma, I...

1132
01:22:21,335 --> 01:22:22,637
It's fine.

1133
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:31,044
Hey, babe.

1134
01:22:31,045 --> 01:22:32,545
Hey.

1135
01:22:32,546 --> 01:22:34,481
What's that?

1136
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,349
It's from Quinton Canosa.

1137
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:39,185
Uh, the artist?

1138
01:22:39,186 --> 01:22:40,787
Yeah.

1139
01:22:40,788 --> 01:22:42,522
He's doing the mural
for the civic center.

1140
01:22:42,523 --> 01:22:44,691
He's the most generous guy.

1141
01:22:44,692 --> 01:22:47,193
I went to his place, saw this,
told him I loved it.

1142
01:22:47,194 --> 01:22:49,462
He sent it over as a gift.
And a note.

1143
01:22:49,463 --> 01:22:51,097
Okay, Jason, I, um...

1144
01:22:51,098 --> 01:22:53,266
Look, um...

1145
01:22:53,267 --> 01:22:55,568
Here. "You told me
your wife loves art,

1146
01:22:55,569 --> 01:22:58,371
"and I hope
she enjoys this as well."

1147
01:22:58,372 --> 01:23:00,640
Amazing.

1148
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:02,697
Can I even accept
something like this?

1149
01:23:03,277 --> 01:23:05,245
Honestly.
Uh...

1150
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:06,279
What's wrong?

1151
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,148
Oh, God. I am...

1152
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:10,552
You know, I had bad sushi.

1153
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,554
It's heavy, too. You know?

1154
01:23:14,555 --> 01:23:16,057
It's gotta be worth a mint.

1155
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,427
You all right?

1156
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:22,564
Babe.

1157
01:23:41,582 --> 01:23:43,385
Hey. Surprise.

1158
01:23:48,489 --> 01:23:50,790
You want a drink?

1159
01:23:50,791 --> 01:23:53,359
Want a brandy?

1160
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,496
Maybe a...
Maybe a wine for the lady?

1161
01:23:56,497 --> 01:23:58,364
Tell me what makes you happy.
Tell me what makes you smile.

1162
01:23:58,365 --> 01:24:00,600
Tell me. Come on.
What do you want?

1163
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:03,770
I can't see you
anymore, Quinton.

1164
01:24:03,771 --> 01:24:05,672
You can't see me anymore?

1165
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,609
Zoe, come on. Zoe...

1166
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:11,611
If it's because of my gift,

1167
01:24:11,612 --> 01:24:13,146
I was just fucking around,
all right?

1168
01:24:13,147 --> 01:24:14,514
I was just playing around.
I was just...

1169
01:24:14,515 --> 01:24:16,182
No, it's not because
of the stupid statue.

1170
01:24:16,183 --> 01:24:18,850
Then what is it? What is it?
Tell me, what is it?

1171
01:24:20,256 --> 01:24:22,455
Oh, my God. Come here.
Please come here.

1172
01:24:22,456 --> 01:24:24,424
Please don't make this
any harder than it has to be.

1173
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:25,760
Okay?

1174
01:24:28,162 --> 01:24:29,896
Quinton.

1175
01:24:29,897 --> 01:24:31,698
Quinton, I need you to hear me.

1176
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:33,766
I am listening to you.

1177
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:36,269
I am listening to you. Okay?

1178
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:37,570
Zoe?

1179
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:38,905
Who the fuck are you?

1180
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:41,307
Who the fuck am I?
Who the fuck are you?

1181
01:24:41,308 --> 01:24:43,576
I got an urgent
text from her to come here.

1182
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:45,345
Zoe, who is this dude?

1183
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,380
Look, I'm sorry.

1184
01:24:47,381 --> 01:24:48,826
I only wanna do this once.

1185
01:24:50,217 --> 01:24:51,217
Do what?

1186
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,255
Wait. You fucking
this guy, too?

1187
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,624
You fuck... What?

1188
01:25:03,864 --> 01:25:04,864
Wow.

1189
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,334
Wow.

1190
01:25:08,335 --> 01:25:10,503
It seems Ms. Zoe has been
cheating not only on her husband,

1191
01:25:10,504 --> 01:25:12,939
but on me, too. Huh?

1192
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,607
Is that right?

1193
01:25:14,608 --> 01:25:17,744
You brought me all the way
down here to confess?

1194
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,345
Is anybody else coming?

1195
01:25:19,346 --> 01:25:21,447
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe we can form a...

1196
01:25:21,448 --> 01:25:23,183
We can form a support group,
some shit like that, huh?

1197
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:24,918
Stop!
Just stop!

1198
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:27,520
Look, I got you both here
at the same time

1199
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:28,755
to tell you that it's over.

1200
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:30,390
This has got to stop, okay?

1201
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:32,692
I love my husband,
I love my children,

1202
01:25:32,693 --> 01:25:34,694
and I don't wanna see you again.

1203
01:25:34,695 --> 01:25:36,596
So you think this is okay?

1204
01:25:36,597 --> 01:25:37,931
You can fuck anybody you want

1205
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:40,400
and then it's just, what,
it's goodbye?

1206
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:43,738
Don't you get it?
I can't control myself.

1207
01:25:45,706 --> 01:25:48,575
It doesn't matter
who I screw. I'm sick.

1208
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,243
Asshole.

1209
01:25:50,244 --> 01:25:51,411
You got a mouth on you.

1210
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:52,780
Listen to me!

1211
01:25:54,248 --> 01:25:55,283
Get off me, man!

1212
01:26:00,654 --> 01:26:02,590
Look, I got no beef
with you, man.

1213
01:26:11,932 --> 01:26:13,935
Hey, buddy. You good?

1214
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:19,240
He's not answering me.

1215
01:26:20,641 --> 01:26:21,776
Oh, Zoe...

1216
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:25,478
You wanna know something, Zoe?

1217
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:26,946
You know,
since I was a little boy,

1218
01:26:26,947 --> 01:26:29,882
people would just
walk away from me.

1219
01:26:29,883 --> 01:26:31,272
Just walk out of my life.

1220
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:34,988
You're not gonna
walk away from me.

1221
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:36,823
You're not gonna leave me.

1222
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:37,991
Don't come near me.

1223
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,960
Oh, you're scared of me now?

1224
01:26:40,961 --> 01:26:43,529
What, my touch isn't
good enough for you now?

1225
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:45,698
Tell me! I'm fucking
asking you something!

1226
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:48,601
Look, let's just talk
about it, okay?

1227
01:26:48,602 --> 01:26:49,836
Just calm down.

1228
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:51,371
Oh, no, no, no.

1229
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,872
We're not gonna talk
about shit anymore,

1230
01:26:52,873 --> 01:26:54,407
you fucking little bitch.

1231
01:26:54,408 --> 01:26:56,448
We're not gonna talk about anything.
Do you hear me?

1232
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:03,616
Oh, you fucking bitch.

1233
01:27:03,617 --> 01:27:05,286
That was not nice.

1234
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:08,923
That was not nice.

1235
01:27:15,796 --> 01:27:17,765
Very fucking painful.

1236
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,935
You see...

1237
01:27:25,539 --> 01:27:27,775
Very fucking painful,
you fucking bitch.

1238
01:27:29,643 --> 01:27:31,477
Come over here,
you fucking bitch!

1239
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:33,982
Where are you going?

1240
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,351
Please let me go!

1241
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:12,387
Don't, Quinton!

1242
01:28:27,668 --> 01:28:29,802
Think I'm gonna hurt you?

1243
01:28:29,803 --> 01:28:31,471
I won't hurt you.

1244
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:33,005
You know,

1245
01:28:33,006 --> 01:28:35,441
all I ever wanted to do,

1246
01:28:35,442 --> 01:28:37,577
was to have some
good sex with you.

1247
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:39,445
That's all.

1248
01:28:39,446 --> 01:28:41,681
But you...

1249
01:28:41,682 --> 01:28:44,450
You made me want you.

1250
01:28:44,451 --> 01:28:45,920
You made me need you!

1251
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:51,001
What you looking at?
Don't look at me like that.

1252
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,861
I told you to leave
your fucking husband,

1253
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:56,529
but you wouldn't listen to me.

1254
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:58,831
Because you're
a little selfish bitch.

1255
01:28:58,832 --> 01:29:00,401
That's why.

1256
01:29:02,936 --> 01:29:06,038
You know that I would never
hurt you like you hurt me.

1257
01:29:06,039 --> 01:29:07,073
I would never do that to you.

1258
01:29:07,074 --> 01:29:09,076
I would never do that to you!

1259
01:29:20,754 --> 01:29:22,555
Look at you.

1260
01:29:22,556 --> 01:29:24,090
Look at you,
you're so fucking beautiful.

1261
01:29:24,091 --> 01:29:25,825
You're so beautiful.

1262
01:29:25,826 --> 01:29:27,760
I'm gonna make sure...

1263
01:29:27,761 --> 01:29:31,964
I'm gonna make sure
your last thoughts are of me.

1264
01:29:31,965 --> 01:29:34,068
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1265
01:29:35,602 --> 01:29:36,604
Okay?

1266
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:40,107
Zoe?

1267
01:29:48,482 --> 01:29:49,760
You can have that back.

1268
01:29:54,087 --> 01:29:55,976
You left this
on the kitchen table.

1269
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:57,990
Told me all I need to know.

1270
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:02,530
Jason?

1271
01:30:03,597 --> 01:30:05,565
Jason, wait!

1272
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:07,289
This motherfucker's just crazy.

1273
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:13,206
What the hell happened?

1274
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:15,808
Jesus. Quinton...

1275
01:30:15,809 --> 01:30:17,612
What did you do?

1276
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:21,716
Hey, baby...

1277
01:30:22,816 --> 01:30:24,518
Hey...

1278
01:30:32,025 --> 01:30:34,227
Jason, please.
Please hear me out.

1279
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:36,228
I don't need to hear
a goddamn thing.

1280
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,664
Got a pretty clear picture here.

1281
01:30:38,665 --> 01:30:39,732
Oh, I am beyond sorry...

1282
01:30:39,733 --> 01:30:40,902
You're sorry?

1283
01:30:42,169 --> 01:30:43,970
Look, I know that I lied.

1284
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,538
But I'm not lying
to you right now

1285
01:30:45,539 --> 01:30:47,907
when I say that
I've been seeing a doctor.

1286
01:30:47,908 --> 01:30:50,297
And she's been helping me
with my condition.

1287
01:30:51,424 --> 01:30:52,845
That's the technical term

1288
01:30:52,846 --> 01:30:54,902
for "screwing around
on your husband"?

1289
01:30:55,849 --> 01:30:57,118
Oh, God. Jason...

1290
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:01,053
I know I fucked up.
I know I did.

1291
01:31:01,054 --> 01:31:02,588
But I love you and you love me!

1292
01:31:02,589 --> 01:31:04,023
And I think we can work it out.

1293
01:31:04,024 --> 01:31:05,636
Yeah, let's all have therapy!

1294
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:08,129
It'll all be great!

1295
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:11,898
Look, you can't just
throw away everything we...

1296
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:13,167
You threw it away!

1297
01:31:15,068 --> 01:31:16,871
You screwed around!

1298
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:20,074
You put our kids in danger!

1299
01:31:21,542 --> 01:31:23,910
I never cheated on you.

1300
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:25,246
You were my life.

1301
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:30,084
I'm still your life.

1302
01:31:32,052 --> 01:31:35,790
You are a lying, cheating whore.

1303
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:38,624
Okay?

1304
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:40,593
We are done.

1305
01:31:40,594 --> 01:31:41,863
Through. It's over.

1306
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:46,766
And you won't be
getting the kids.

1307
01:31:51,071 --> 01:31:52,183
You don't mean that.

1308
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:56,642
You're dead to me.

1309
01:31:56,643 --> 01:31:58,110
You hear me?

1310
01:31:58,111 --> 01:31:59,947
You're fucking dead.

1311
01:32:12,025 --> 01:32:13,828
Without you, I am dead.

1312
01:32:22,769 --> 01:32:23,769
Zoe!

1313
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,334
I can't believe it came to this.

1314
01:33:28,335 --> 01:33:29,335
Me neither.

1315
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:03,003
<i>You can't escape!</i>

1316
01:34:29,963 --> 01:34:32,199
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can do this.

1317
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:36,335
What? Jason, what is it?

1318
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,709
All those people
you were with...

1319
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:46,233
When I look at you,
that's all I can see.

1320
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:56,956
Surprise!

1321
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:58,159
Whoo!

1322
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:03,095
Wow.

1323
01:35:03,096 --> 01:35:04,530
Hi.

1324
01:35:04,531 --> 01:35:06,432
Is it okay to hug you?
I don't wanna break you.

1325
01:35:06,433 --> 01:35:09,435
Oh, break my heart
is more like it.

1326
01:35:09,436 --> 01:35:11,504
Come here.
Go ahead.

1327
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:12,972
I love you, Mom.

1328
01:35:12,973 --> 01:35:14,141
I love you more.

1329
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:18,144
Come here.

1330
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:19,945
I missed you all.

1331
01:35:19,946 --> 01:35:21,814
Me, too.

1332
01:35:21,815 --> 01:35:23,951
I'm glad you're home.

1333
01:36:15,535 --> 01:36:17,336
Hi, Brina.

1334
01:36:17,337 --> 01:36:18,971
She's in there, watching TV.

1335
01:36:18,972 --> 01:36:20,174
Okay.

1336
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,413
What is this?

1337
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:29,137
You don't even like television.

1338
01:36:30,283 --> 01:36:31,951
It's numbing.

1339
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:33,586
What the hell
are you doing, Zoe?

1340
01:36:33,587 --> 01:36:36,322
You've been sitting in this
house for months now.

1341
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:38,392
The pity party
officially ends today.

1342
01:36:40,673 --> 01:36:42,428
Look, I need more time.
Mmm-mmm.

1343
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:44,196
Your time is up.

1344
01:36:44,197 --> 01:36:45,598
You need to get up,

1345
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:48,434
and get your behind
back to work.

1346
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:51,437
This ain't fair to you or
those beautiful kids of yours.

1347
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:53,105
Now, come on.

1348
01:36:53,106 --> 01:36:55,040
Come on. Uh-uh.

1349
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:56,508
I'm not... I'm not ready
to go anywhere yet.

1350
01:36:56,509 --> 01:36:58,010
I'm not ready to go.

1351
01:36:58,011 --> 01:37:00,080
Dr. Spencer called
this morning again.

1352
01:37:01,314 --> 01:37:03,092
Says you're not taking her call.

1353
01:37:04,150 --> 01:37:06,317
She asked that
I make sure you get this.

1354
01:37:10,757 --> 01:37:12,424
You know what, Zoe? You can
try to chase me away,

1355
01:37:12,425 --> 01:37:13,870
but I ain't going nowhere.

1356
01:37:16,263 --> 01:37:18,163
Listen to me, damn it!

1357
01:37:18,164 --> 01:37:20,633
Brina, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, okay?

1358
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:21,634
I really do.

1359
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:26,472
Oh!

1360
01:37:26,473 --> 01:37:29,409
You did not just turn that television
back on while I was talking to you!

1361
01:37:29,609 --> 01:37:31,644
Okay.

1362
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:34,480
If that's how it's gonna be,

1363
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:36,083
then we will just watch TV.

1364
01:37:37,684 --> 01:37:39,129
But I ain't going nowhere.

1365
01:37:41,822 --> 01:37:44,456
<i>...and you're going
to have to make 250 portions.</i>

1366
01:37:44,457 --> 01:37:46,158
<i>And then you
think you're a chef, right?</i>

1367
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:47,993
<i>Well, I do hope so.</i>

1368
01:37:47,994 --> 01:37:50,029
Grandma!
Grandma!

1369
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,365
Can I get a hug? Hello?

1370
01:37:53,266 --> 01:37:55,134
Bye, babe. Mmm.

1371
01:37:55,135 --> 01:37:56,503
See you.

1372
01:37:58,204 --> 01:37:59,538
Silly banana...

1373
01:37:59,539 --> 01:38:01,006
All right, go ahead.

1374
01:38:01,007 --> 01:38:02,675
Bye, Dad.
What do we do first?

1375
01:38:02,676 --> 01:38:05,144
Wash our hands
and do our homework.

1376
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:06,347
All right.

1377
01:38:08,481 --> 01:38:11,250
How you doing?
I'm good.

1378
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:14,086
But you're not.

1379
01:38:14,087 --> 01:38:17,476
You know, the kids think we go
to the hotel to let Mommy rest.

1380
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:23,295
I don't know how to
tell them that we're apart.

1381
01:38:23,296 --> 01:38:24,365
She loves you.

1382
01:38:25,498 --> 01:38:27,299
She messed up.

1383
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:28,367
But she needs you now,

1384
01:38:28,368 --> 01:38:29,635
more than ever.

1385
01:38:29,636 --> 01:38:32,738
And if I can
forgive her, so can you.

1386
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:34,351
What about your wedding vows?

1387
01:38:36,155 --> 01:38:37,743
"In sickness and in health."

1388
01:38:37,744 --> 01:38:39,445
Those weren't just words,
were they?

1389
01:38:39,446 --> 01:38:41,724
Yeah, what about
honesty and faithfulness?

1390
01:38:42,248 --> 01:38:43,484
It's a sickness.

1391
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,221
Well, I have trouble
understanding that.

1392
01:38:49,222 --> 01:38:51,724
You two built this house
and this family together.

1393
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:53,625
And just because it doesn't
fit into a perfect package,

1394
01:38:53,626 --> 01:38:56,063
are you willing to throw
all that away?

1395
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:03,202
Here.

1396
01:40:03,563 --> 01:40:04,786
Thank you, sweetheart.

1397
01:40:09,202 --> 01:40:10,636
Welcome, everyone.

1398
01:40:10,637 --> 01:40:12,371
Hi.

1399
01:40:12,372 --> 01:40:14,274
Looks like we have a new member.

1400
01:40:16,342 --> 01:40:19,065
Would you like to stand up
and introduce yourself?

1401
01:40:24,684 --> 01:40:26,120
Hi, I'm Zoe.
Hi.

1402
01:40:27,487 --> 01:40:29,189
And I am a sex addict.

1403
01:40:33,093 --> 01:40:36,263
When I was 10 years old,
I was raped by three boys.

1404
01:40:39,399 --> 01:40:43,704
Uh, I buried that memory
far, far away

1405
01:40:45,605 --> 01:40:48,207
until someone I know

1406
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:50,711
reminded me exactly
why I had to remember.

1407
01:40:52,579 --> 01:40:53,680
It ruined my life.

1408
01:40:56,749 --> 01:40:59,553
It, uh, destroyed my family.

1409
01:41:01,421 --> 01:41:04,723
I, uh, would lie and cheat

1410
01:41:04,724 --> 01:41:07,327
and do whatever I could
to get that fix.

1411
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:13,734
I love my husband.

1412
01:41:22,843 --> 01:41:24,810
I know it's hard
for him to believe that,

1413
01:41:24,811 --> 01:41:26,080
but I do.

1414
01:41:28,414 --> 01:41:29,583
I miss my friend.

1415
01:41:31,918 --> 01:41:34,588
I miss my best friend,
and I know that

1416
01:41:37,457 --> 01:41:40,235
with help from the one person
that I hurt the most,

1417
01:41:42,896 --> 01:41:44,331
I can get better.

1418
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:10,591
Our love is forever.

1419
01:42:13,259 --> 01:42:14,294
Always has been.

1420
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:17,631
Always will be.
