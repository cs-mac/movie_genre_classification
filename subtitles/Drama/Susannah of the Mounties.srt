- What's this?

1178
00:41:41,796 --> 00:41:53,010

1181
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,784
Chief Big Eagle say here bad Indians
who make trouble for covered wagon...

1182
00:42:03,784 --> 00:42:03,888


1183
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,255
And steal horses
from Iron Horse camp.

1184
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:06,356

Show redcoat he keep word.

00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,165
Take them
to the guardroom.

1188
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:36,320


1189
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,119
- This fellow's dead, sir. He's been stabbed.
- They're all dead, sir.

1190
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:46,263


1191
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,494
Order out a detail
to bury them.

1193
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:02,341
Well, this looks as if Big Eagle
is showing his defiance.

1194

1195
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:05,176
He knows the dispensing of justice
belongs to the Mounted Police.

1196
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:05,283


1197
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:08,615
I'll take that up with him
when he comes to sign the treaty.

1198

1200
00:43:11,416 --> 00:43:11,522


1201
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,685
Chambers, if I should decide
to send Vicky home...

1202
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:14,792


1203
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,420
Could you do anything for me
in the way of transportation?

1204
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:17,528


1205
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,463
I certainly could, sir. There's a supply
train up on Sunday morning...

1206
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:20,565


1207
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,533
That'll take her as far
as Winnipeg.

1208
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:22,633


1209
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,795
From there, she can connect
with the Eastern Limited.

1210
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:24,902


1211
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,496
I agree with you. It'd be wise
to get her away from here.

1212
00:43:27,496 --> 00:43:27,605


1213
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,336
- <i>I'll</i> let you know.
- No, thanks. I won't come in now.

1214
00:43:30,336 --> 00:43:30,440


1215
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,433
I better get back to the camp
to see that everything's all right then.

1216
00:43:33,434 --> 00:43:33,543


1217
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,740
- Good night.
- Good night, Chambers.

1218

1219
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,019
Won't you eat your eggs, sir?
They're that fresh...

1220
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:48,125


1221
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,458
I just saw the cook take them
from under the hen with his own hands.

All ready for you.

- Heaven help us.

00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:16,786


1231
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,485

same complaint this morning, I'm thinking.

1232
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:20,591


1233
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,559
Well, I'll get
a bit of work done. Sir?

1234
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:22,660


1235
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,958
Hmm? Oh, yes.
Go ahead.

1245
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,837
- Better than I am?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

1246

1247
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,708
- Are you going to marry her?
- Marry her?

1248
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:48,819


1249
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:53,347
Well, I was watching you
dance together last night.

1250
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:53,456


1251
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:57,519
And the way she looked at you, and the way
you looked at her, I thought maybe-

1252
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:57,628


1253
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,461
Don't you think you
ought to have your breakfast?

1255
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:06,197
Yes, sir. But I supposed that when people
were in love, they always got married.

1256
00:45:06,197 --> 00:45:06,304


1257
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,396
She's going home tomorrow.

1261
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,871
- She is? She's really going home?
- Mm-hmm.

1262

1263
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:17,414
Oh, isn't that a shame? Won't you sit
over here in the rocking chair?

1264
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:17,515


1265
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:19,916
- It's much more comfortable.
- No, thanks.

1266

1267
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:23,453
I'll get you your pipe.
Would you like your pipe?

1269

Here's some matches too.

1271
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:31,558
I guess you smoke more matches than you do
tobacco. Can I get you anything else?
