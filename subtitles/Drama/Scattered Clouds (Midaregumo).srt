NEW DESTINY FOR HIROSHI EDA

17
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,145
What do you think?
I got it.

18
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,779
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,429
- When will we leave?
- In three weeks.

20
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,662
So soon? You said
we had a month.

21
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,388
Yes, but things have changed.

22
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:39,185
How is the baby?

23
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,459
The doctor says everything is ok,
that we have to stay calm.

24
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,983
Do you know where we will live?

25
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,783
At the beginning in a hotel.
I must replace Mr. Izeki.

26
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,104
Listen, by the way,
how's your English?

27
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,222
Have you improved it?

28
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,025
What do you mean
if I have improved it?

29
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,658
Don't you know that I studied
English in school?

30
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,829
A few days ago you couldn't
make a phrase, you sucked.

31
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,065
Yes, it's truth. Maybe I should
have taken conversation classes.

32
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,983
I told you to study in case
I got the promotion.

33
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,265
I know.

34
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,739
And it will be a problem.

35
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,424
But I didn't think they would
give it to you so soon.

36
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:22,818
No, eh?

37
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,666
Ok, so when it's going to happen?

38
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,627
What?

39
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,579
The baby thing.

40
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,427
Next year,
at the beginning of January.

41
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,865
Yes? It will be fantastic.

42
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,704
Happy New Year.

43
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,105
No, it's ok.
I don't want more, I will eat now.

44
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,307
- Now? Why?
- Because I must go to Hakone.

45
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,620
But today is Saturday.

46
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,590
Do you work on Saturday?
Or you're going to play some golf?

47
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,103
No, I got work to do.

48
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,223
The director wants me
to help him with some things.

49
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,863
Well, what can you do?

50
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,539
Waiter!

51
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,145
- Will you stay for dinner?
- Yes.

52
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,425
That's it!

53
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,219
Teruo,...

54
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,421
your mother must be worried.

55
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,182
It's time for you
to go back home, ok?

56
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,146
Yes.

57
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,498
- I'll leave now, see you tomorrow.
- OK, bye-hi-hi.

58
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,988
Bye-hi-hi, Keroyon.

59
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,299
Keroyon.

60
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,177
What is that of
“bye-hi-hi, Keroyon”?

61
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't you know? It's done
this way: Bye-hi-hi, Keroyon.

62
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,028
It's from a television show.

63
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,545
Really? Bye-hi-hi, Keroyon.
Like this?

64
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,024
Yes, hello?

65
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,262
Hello, dear.

66
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,824
Have you heard?

67
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,819
Exactly.

68
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:51,059
Yes, Yumiko and Hiroshi…
they're going to Washington.

69
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,501
Don't you think is great?

70
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:54,670
Aunt, what is this book?

71
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,825
Look…

72
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,619
Listen…

73
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,985
“What bus do I get”?

74
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,820
I help you make the luggage,
if you want.

75
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:34,896
Thank you very much.

76
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:36,389
- See you soon.
- Good bye.

77
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,464
Sleep.

78
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,345
Listen, dad…

79
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,944
Dad, won't you go away
to America someday?

80
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,385
To America? To do what?

81
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,866
Auntie and uncle
are going very soon.

82
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,820
Your father doesn't like
America, not a bit.

83
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,060
Nor England or France?

84
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,868
That's right, I don't like them either.

85
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,543
Then what do you like?

86
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,341
I only like Japan.

87
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,019
Yes, hello?

88
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,104
Yes, Yumiko is my wife's sister.

89
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,066
Yes, she has just gone home.

90
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,946
What?

91
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,865
Her husband?

92
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,826
Where? In Hakone? Yes.

93
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,219
What happens?

94
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,381
- Is Hiroshi in Hakone?
- Yes.

95
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,108
He got run over by a car.

96
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,539
My God…!

97
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,709
His wife is late,
it's almost dawn.

98
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,699
Where is the driver
that ran over him?

99
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,223
At the police station.

100
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,987
We should have prevented him...

101
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,266
from going around,
don't you think?

102
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,979
Yes, I knew he couldn't
hold his liquor.

103
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,585
Darling!

104
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,224
I will go alone.
You don't have to go.

105
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,789
It would be better
if you don't.

106
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,463
No. I will go.

107
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,978
The company whose driver
ran over him sent it.

108
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,861
Of course,...

109
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,666
they must be very concerned
knowing that the victim was…

110
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,263
a Government employee.

111
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,228
You know? The company director
came to see me yesterday.

112
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,385
Yes…

113
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,582
By the way, it is necessary to cover
Eda's position as soon as possible.

114
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,503
- Have you already chosen somebody?
- No, not yet.

115
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,380
Then do it soon,
we can’t waste any more time.

116
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,380
Yes.

117
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,782
Look, the one that ran over him.

118
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,701
SHIRO MISHIMA.
MEIJI COMMERCIAL COMPANY.

119
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,098
Mrs. Eda...

120
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,020
I am Shiro Mishima,
of Meiji Commercial.

121
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,310
I'm very sorry
about the accident.

122
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,260
You?

123
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,549
Are you the driver?

124
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,826
Are you the one
who killed my son?

125
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,948
What is it that
you want now?

126
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,625
You…

127
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,226
You have killed my son.
So why did you come here?

128
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,187
We'll talk some other time.
We'll compensate you for what happened.

129
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,945
Mrs. Eda, we want to express you...

130
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,027
ours more sincere condolences.

131
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,419
You…

132
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,185
Where are you going?

133
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,825
Yumiko!

134
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,419
Let's go.

135
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,547
You shouldn't have come.

136
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,829
Do you want to see the director?

137
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,460
Yes.

138
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,024
What are you going to do?

139
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,105
The transfer is already issued.

140
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,699
You are suspended temporarily.

141
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,588
What else do you want to know?
I believe the reason is clear.

142
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,186
The Ministry
of Industry and Commerce...

143
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,581
is very important for commercial
companies as ourselves,...

144
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,422
there's no need to say it.

145
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,421
You have killed…

146
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,226
one of its civil employees,
although accidentally.

147
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,348
That's very serious.

148
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,062
I ask you to wait...

149
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,779
for the police investigation
to finish.

150
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,346
As you said,
it was an accident.

151
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,138
Do you mean it was not
your responsibility?

152
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,904
No, I feel morally responsible.

153
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,012
That's why I will compensate them.

154
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,346
Do you think you
shouldn't be suspended?

155
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,542
The truth is
they have told me...

156
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,260
that after the temporary suspension
I'll be transfer to Aomori.

157
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,784
Is that true?

158
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,618
Who told you that?

159
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,622
That's what you're
planning to do with me.

160
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,259
Is it true?

161
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,747
I'll be sincere with you.

162
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,063
Who was with you
when you had the accident?

163
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,619
I already know that you
were with Mr. Bennett,...

164
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,508
but there was somebody
else, wasn't it?

165
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,025
Yes, some lady called Harumi.

166
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,701
- Still…
- No excuses.

167
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,383
It's not an excuse.

168
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,628
I was ordered to entertain
Mr. Bennett and that's what I did.

169
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,985
In addition,
the manager knew about it.

170
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,703
Some journalists...

171
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,430
have tried to turn this
into a scandal,...

172
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,182
to gain from the situation.

173
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,068
They have blackmailed me.

174
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,268
The police also came. They accuse us
of promoting and exerting prostitution.

175
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,988
I would like to know if you
are responsible for that.

176
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,341
- Sir, the board is waiting.
- I'll be right there.

177
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,132
Ok.

178
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,418
I am going to go to Aomori.

179
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,263
If that's an order, I don't have
other choice but to obey,...

180
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,383
but I believe you have
other reasons to send me there.

181
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,063
I want to know what are they.

182
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,823
Junko and I have plans…

183
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,981
What are you suggesting now?

184
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,981
This is a working place,...

185
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,379
I won't discuss private matters here,
it's not the suitable place.

186
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,298
On the other hand, I've already
told you more than once:...

187
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,869
I don't approve your engagement with
my daughter. I don't approve it at all.

188
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,984
Are we clear?

189
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,786
Good morning.
He's already arrived, he's inside.

190
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,860
Thank you.

191
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,867
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine.

192
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,221
It was a little dirty,
wasn't it?

193
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,823
Yes, as usual.

194
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,149
I've spoken to your father.

195
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:18,226
Really? And what did he say?

196
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,629
Well, you were right.

197
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,588
He has intention to transfer me.

198
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,140
In addition, I must
stay home…

199
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,904
until the trial for
the accident is over.

200
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,852
I'll prepare some tea,
if you want.

201
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,371
You could come
with me to Aomori.

202
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,335
Aomori is not very different
from Tokyo.

203
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,812
You would be fine there.

204
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,059
I cannot go to Aomori.

205
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,594
And my father doesn't have
anything to do with it,...

206
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,133
it is my decision.

207
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,739
I'm sorry, I really am,...

208
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,333
but I cannot go.

209
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,654
I understand.

210
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,893
Don't worry.

211
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,772
I owe you so much…

212
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,811
You have come
here to cook...

213
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,336
many times, very often.

214
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,529
You have been everything to me during
these two years, you have been my life.

215
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,613
I'll go get some tea.

216
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,368
Therefore,...

217
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,532
the decision of this court
concerning this case,...

218
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,920
after listening to all parts and
examining the evidence,...

219
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,573
is the following:

220
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,737
there's no indication
of any crime,...

221
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,773
neither in the witnesses’ statements...

222
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,216
nor in the evidence
presented.

223
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,452
Therefore, the defendant
is found not guilty.

224
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,930
The defendant's car
had a flat tire,...

225
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,137
which caused an imbalance
in the wheels’ alignment

226
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,327
This imbalance
made the car...

227
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,335
swerve out of control
towards the victim.

228
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:07,337
The defendant didn't have time
to control the vehicle,...

229
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,536
The tire deflated quickly.

230
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,531
Therefore,
this court concludes...

231
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,851
that the accident was beyond
the defendant's control.

232
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,813
The defendant is found not guilty
of reckless driving.

233
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,097
He won't have to face
any kind of penalty either,...

234
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,896
nor indemnify
the victim's family,...

235
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,338
since he is declared free of
all legal responsibility.

236
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,649
Mrs. Eda?

237
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,136
Yes.

238
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,334
This is the resolution
of the case.

239
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,569
If you like, I can explain you the content
briefly, in case you have any doubts.

240
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,016
According with the Public Services
National Law,...

241
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,689
and considering
all circumstances,...

242
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,420
a pension will be granted
to Mr. Eda's widow,...

243
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,059
for life.

244
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,378
You will receive 72,700
yens a year.

245
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,577
This amount is 10%
the deceased's average salary,...

246
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,937
since the time he was employed
was inferior to 10 years.

247
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,132
If Mrs. Eda removed herself
from the family register...

248
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,097
or she married again,...

249
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,616
the payment of the pension
would be automatically terminated.

250
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,259
Do you have any questions?

251
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,018
Yes, we presented
pregnancy certificate...

252
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:17,893
and you haven't said
anything about…

253
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,453
Mrs. Eda is only
three months pregnant.

254
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,692
Therefore, there is
no additional amount for that.

255
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,219
As you can see, the funeral
expenses are included.

256
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,974
The wreath
comes from the Minister.

257
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,018
837.731 total.

258
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,535
Now if you could sign
the receipt…

259
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,530
Yes.

260
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,895
Yumiko…

261
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,969
Excuse me.

262
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,496
- I think we are late.
- No.

263
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,849
Yumiko.

264
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,454
What would you like to drink?

265
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,210
What do you want?
A cold tea?

266
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,217
- Two teas, please.
- Very well.

267
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,289
What…?

268
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,139
Which was the verdict?

269
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,095
Not guilty.

270
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,329
Not guilty?

271
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,210
Doesn't you have to pay
for what happened?

272
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,336
No indemnification?
Nothing?

273
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,218
No, legally no.

274
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,579
Then, we cannot…

275
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,817
Look, this is my salary.

276
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,696
I do not make much money,
Mrs. Eda,...

277
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,090
but I'll pay
what I can.

278
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,379
Seventeen days ago,...

279
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,648
my husband and I
were seating here.

280
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,014
We were having a toast
to his promotion…

281
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,249
Yumiko…

282
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,254
We were going to move to
the Washington Embassy...

283
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,175
We were leaving
in four days.

284
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,097
I'll pay what you want,
I'll give you an amount every month.

285
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,099
How much do you want
altogether?

286
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,211
I don't want your money.

287
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,933
I want my husband back,
that is what I want.

288
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,534
Wait, please.

289
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,219
Yumiko, leave us alone.
I will speak to him. Go home.

290
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,053
15.000 yens a month
for ten years.

291
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,372
It's a rather
hard punishment.

292
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,811
Not so hard, it's not
so much money.

293
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,050
1.800.000 altogether.

294
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,331
And Yumiko didn't want it,
good luck that I helped her.

295
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:22,203
If we don't look out for you,
you end up with nothing.

296
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,353
It doesn't matter, I don't want
anything from him.

297
00:23:24,354 --> 00:23:25,053
Come on...

298
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,014
If I think that…

299
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,134
from now on,
we must live with this money…

300
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,979
I won't accept it.

301
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,815
Come on, money is always money.

302
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,258
- And the contract?
- We will sign it soon.

303
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,654
- That man is very good.
- Why?

304
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,888
He is not guilty.

305
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,456
If I were him,
I wouldn't pay anything.

306
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,174
I would see no reason.

307
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,975
I think...

308
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,452
I will send the money
to Kyoto.

309
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,139
Don't be a fool,...

310
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,338
Are you sending money
to your husband's parents?

311
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,091
But…

312
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,649
I don't understand that you want
to send money to them,...

313
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,811
after what they tried
to do to you.

314
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,813
They don't deserve it,
they wanted you out of the family,...

315
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,735
they wanted to get rid of you
to have Hiroshi's pension.

316
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,573
How much is left?

317
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,057
- 72.700 a year.
- I see.

318
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,093
Then it's 6.000
a month, isn't it?

319
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,932
Stop, please. Don't speak
about money any more.

320
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,450
How much long can you
stay at the residence?

321
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,458
About two months.

322
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,610
We must look for an apartment.

323
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,455
She can stay
and live with us.

324
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,929
There isn't enough
room for we all.

325
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,136
I know it's going
to be hard,...

326
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,137
even more you being pregnant.

327
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,649
Come on!

328
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,258
- Just a little more!
- Yes.

329
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,135
A little more.

330
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,209
Leave it there.

331
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,859
Come on, hurry up.

332
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,815
Ok, let's go!

333
00:25:10,494 --> 00:25:12,001
- I leave it go off, eh?
- Yes.

334
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,130
- Three.
- Three.

335
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,929
- Four.
- Four.

336
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,853
- Five.
- Five.

337
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,176
- Six.
- Six.

338
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,410
- Seven.
- Seven.

339
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,732
So how is the boy?

340
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,691
Really?
Fantastic!

341
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,494
Happy new year.

342
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,499
Yumiko!

343
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,409
Come on in.

344
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,538
Ah, it's you, hello.

345
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,770
I was out shopping
some things.

346
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,695
What do you want?

347
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,251
I brought the contract
for you to review it and sign it.

348
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,139
Ah, very well, thanks,
I will sign.

349
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,290
By the way, I suppose
you received my letter.

350
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:31,290
No.

351
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,095
I asked you to send me
the money.

352
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,216
She will be moving soon.

353
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,530
- Very well.
- Thanks. Just a second.

354
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,896
Tell him to go away immediately.

355
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,849
And not to come back,
not even come near again.

356
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,496
AOMORI STATION

357
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,218
MEIJI COMMERCIAL COMPANY.
OFFICE OF AOMORI.

358
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,057
Good morning, I come from Tokyo.
Mi name is Shiro Mishima.

359
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,378
Ah, Shiro Mishima,...

360
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,533
they said you would arrive today.
Come on in, have a seat.

361
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,420
- I am Kasai, the director.
- Nice to meet you.

362
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,414
- This place isn't comfortable.
- No.

363
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,571
Yuri, is the accommodation ready?

364
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,770
Yes.

365
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,939
- What do we do now? We leave?
- Yes, let's go.

366
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,809
- Yumiko, we'll go now, ok?
-Yes.

367
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,574
Hello, Yumiko.

368
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,409
Good afternoon.

369
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,459
- Are you pleased with my sister?
- Yes, she is a very hard worker.

370
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,011
- Ok, good bye.
- Good bye.

371
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,853
Good bye.

372
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,572
That man looked like a gangster
or something like that.

373
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,571
He's a client
of the company.

374
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,649
I see.

375
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,491
I would like to have
a house like this one.

376
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,574
What do you came
here for?

377
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,614
The money has arrived
from Mishima, here you are.

378
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,409
Thanks.

379
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,219
Still hard to accept it?

380
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,340
- It comes handy.
- Of course it does.

381
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,732
This will help you cover
the money you send to Kyoto.

382
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,409
When you open the envelope,
is there usually some message?

383
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,696
No, a few words,
nothing in particular.

384
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,613
As long as he sends the money,
he can write what he wants.

385
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,613
Yes, sure. Although I hate
to depend on others.

386
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,654
Have you already thought
about what we talked yesterday?

387
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,100
I don't want to return
to my home town.

388
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:20,085
Why?

389
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,614
Wrap up,
you'll catch a cold.

390
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,973
You have a hard
and exhausting job.

391
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,255
Ah, hello.

392
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,329
I come to bring
the money in person.

393
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,572
Thanks, thank you very much.

394
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,015
- Wait, I will give you a receipt.
- No, it's ok.

395
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,612
How is Mrs. Eda?

396
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,129
She is…

397
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,609
not very well.

398
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,614
The company where
she worked closed...

399
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,089
and now she has to find
another job.

400
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,012
I've seen her today.

401
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,290
It's not easy for a woman
to get by all by herself.

402
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,450
And the money
you give her....

403
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,929
is hardly enough
for the expenses of the house.

404
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,934
I beg you that you continue to help her.
You'll do that, right?

405
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,136
Yes.

406
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,014
Thanks, thank you very much.

407
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,298
I'm almost sure I will be able
to convince the director...

408
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,972
so they send back to Tokyo.

409
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,016
Thanks.

410
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,258
Your case couldn't be called
a labor failure, that's clear.

411
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,691
Time will put
things in their place.

412
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,008
Ok, how are
you doing in Aomori?

413
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,213
It is too sad.

414
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,492
The boss's daughter got
engaged, you knew that?

415
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,854
She got engaged
to a banker's son.

416
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,857
Anyway, don't feel bad.
Time heals all wounds. Drink.

417
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,253
I forgot her
long time ago.

418
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,336
I am glad.

419
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,336
Eh, Yuriko, come over here, come on.

420
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,413
- Am I not interrupting?
- We've finished. Come, sit over here.

421
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,328
Hello. How are you doing?

422
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,093
Thank you very much, Sir.

423
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,653
Thank you very much, Sir.

424
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,570
- Thank you very much, Sir.
- There you have.

425
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,170
I'm very sorry, I can't accept
anything from clients. Good morning.

426
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,535
It is only a letter, read it.
Please.

427
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,770
I've already said "no"
the other day.

428
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,411
- Hello, dear.
- Hello.

429
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,173
You forget the change.

430
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,338
What? Not yet?

431
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,009
I appreciate Katsuko's
offer, but…

432
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,252
Speaking of Katsuko….

433
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,548
I believe she's
more kind lately.

434
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,577
Above all, ever since
our brother died.

435
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,617
Do you remember when
she wanted to expand?

436
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,658
She even let us know when
she decided to construct the annexe.

437
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,449
I know the Shinoe hotel
is legally hers,...

438
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:04,057
I don't deny that, but it's also
the place where we were born.

439
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,257
You don't have
to be afraid.

440
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,775
And, in addition,
you will also have work there.

441
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,248
I don't know why,…

442
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,088
but I don't like her.

443
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,052
And why is that?

444
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,056
We don't get along.

445
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,211
But you two used
to get along just fine.

446
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,133
Listen, you have told her
to write, haven't you?

447
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,136
No, not at all.
I swear it was Katsuko's idea.

448
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,298
She said: “We widows have
to take care of each other".

449
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,409
I'm sorry, no.

450
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,452
I almost forget...
The money.

451
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,414
It arrived yesterday.
It's arriving late lately.

452
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,570
Why don't you want to return
to your home town?

453
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,019
I want to live without being tied
to anything or anybody.

454
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,695
And I don't want that money,
I really mean it.

455
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,209
“Dear lady,...

456
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,175
"concerning the register problem...

457
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,298

the telephone last week,...

458

"I ask you to read the family
register copy which I attach,...

459
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,173
"corresponding
to the Eda family.

460
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,972
"As you can see,

461
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,695

468
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,716
"Therefore, you are
no longer tied...

469
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:51,497

472
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,454
Mishima, why don't you
come with me?

473
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,854
Give me a hand,
I speak very little English.

474
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,299
I'm done for today, I am tired.
I'm very sorry.

475
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,169
Mr. Mishima!

476
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,415
You have a visit.

477
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:24,174
- Who is it?
- I don't know, it's outside.

478
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,896
You were born near
Towada Lake.

479
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,897
Well, I came here
a year ago.

480
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,499
How careless she is!

481
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,677
She's from the countryside,
you can tell.

482
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,409
Let's switch.

483
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,054
So this is your home town.

484
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,172
I won't speak
bad of it.

485
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,859
Here you are,
your money.

486
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,614
- But, why?
- I've already explained it.

487
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,136
I've lost any right
to receive it.

488
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,170
I am no longer a Eda to the law, that's
why it's not right for me to receive it.

489
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,858
This money has nothing
to do with the law.

490
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,052
I know, but…

491
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,450
Please, forget what happened.

492
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,417
I will try to forget it as well.

493
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,497
Besides, the money
you give me...

494
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,012
cannot help me go through
the pain in any way.

495
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,189
Nevertheless, I want
to tell you...

496
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,852
I'm most grateful for it.

497
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,849
I understand.

498
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,696
I'm sorry I've been
late sometimes.

499
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,619
Thank you very much, Sir.

500
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,255
You know?

501
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,532
I feel a little sad.

502
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,850
When I saw you...

503
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,922
Well,... I haven't felt
that in a while.

504
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,695
I don't know how
to explain it...

505
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,458
It's like we were…

506
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,813
relatives or something
like that.

507
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,456
I have…

508
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,253
I must go.

509
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,929
Yes, sure.

510
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,971
Take care.
Take care of yourself.

511
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,096
- Welcome home.
- Hello.

512
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,689
Thanks.

513
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,419
It's been a long time.

514
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,813
-It's a big hotel now.
- Yes.

515
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,205
- Miss Yumiko has arrived.
- Welcome.

516
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:31,618
- How are you?
- A little busy at this time. How about you?

517
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,819
How are you?
A little thinner, aren't you?

518
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,331
- Hello. It's good to see you!
- Welcome home, Miss Yumiko.

519
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,173
- I am going to live back here.
- I am very glad.

520
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,218
- Gene, show her to her room.
- Yes.

521
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,815
- Thanks, I will be right back.
- No rush.

522
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,698
That one is Yumiko.

523
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,500
- Won't you introduce me to her?
- When she comes down.

524
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,493
Your old room is used
for the clients now.

525
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,580
Don't worry about that,
I have come alone.

526
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,178
- Yumiko…
- Yes?

527
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,819
Listen, look,...

528
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,979
I would like to introduce you
to the wood inspectors.

529
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,210
- It's…
- It will be only a moment.

530
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,929
- Prepare the bathroom, would you?
- Yes.

531
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,128
Have some more.

532
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:29,733
You didn't bring us here
for nothing. We know each other.

533
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,897
What things you say!

534
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,050
Cheers!

535
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:37,532
- This is the new part.
- It's very pretty.

536
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,498
Excuse me, gentlemen.

537
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,731
Welcome you all.

538
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,571
Allow me to introduce my sister,
she has just arrived from Tokyo.

539
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,776
- Her name is Yumiko.
- Nice to meet you.

540
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,014
I think she'll be the main
attraction of the Shinoe hotel...

541
00:45:56,015 --> 00:45:57,014
from now on.

542
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,499
Don't you think, gentlemen?

543
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,857
What I think is that she is much more
beautiful than you. I mean it.

544
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,778
You are really bad!

545
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,413
That gentleman is the boss.

546
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,414
And the one seating next to him
is Mr. Inohue.

547
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,531
Mr. Inohue is the assistant director.

548
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,735
Nice to meet you.

549
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,416
Inohue is single, in case you are wondering.
He's looking for a woman.

550
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,899
No, not at all!

551
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,133
He is the owner of
the Yakiyama sawmill.

552
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,493
He helped me a lot
when I built the annexe.

553
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,418
I had very little money...

554
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,771
and nobody to support me.

555
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,819
But he was very kind.

556
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,966
We women are
very weak.

557
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:57,004
I often think I should
write more often,...

558
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:59,047
I don't know,
tell them about the hotel,...

559
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,405
but the truth is
I almost don't have any time.

560
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,683
It's ok. I understand...

561
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,649
You have to run the hotel
and that comes first.

562
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:11,119
It's not easy to run
a business without any help.

563
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,689
You really mean it?

564
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:13,960
Yes.

565
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,925
Thanks.

566
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:20,685
It knew you would understand,
but I was afraid.

567
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,360
His business is not
going well lately,...

568
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,645
and I do what I can
to help him.

569
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:32,363
But now his wife is spreading
rumors about us.

570
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,849
Then he is married?

571
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,166
Yes, he is. And he has two children.

572
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,241
But, well, someday
things will work out for him...

573
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,124
and then everybody
will realize.

574
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:52,566
Come on in, come on in.
You can come in now.

575
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,008
Well, if I may...

576
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,842
Of course you may come in.

577
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:04,726
Here you are.

578
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:11,959
A little bit?

579
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:16,087
- I prefer to eat something.
- A tiny drink would do you good.

580
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,320
- Come on.
- All right.

581
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,361
Tomorrow I must
go to town,...

582
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,760
I'll drop by the employment office.

583
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,608
I'm a little short of personnel.

584
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,479
I'm home!

585
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:47,005
Good night…
Oh, drunk again!

586
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,326
Your mother is here,
she arrived a while ago.

587
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:50,919
My mother?

588
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,598
Mother, what happens?

589
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,634
Why didn't you let me
know you were coming?

590
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,721
Your letter
troubled me greatly.

591
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,524
You seemed very disappointed
and unhappy.

592
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,921
No, no. How is my brother?
Is he doing all right?

593
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,929
Your brother is very well.

594
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,999
- And the others?
- Fine, all of them.

595
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,725
I was talking to
the house-keeper...

596
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,649
She tells me that you
come back late every night.

597
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,169
Drink helps.

598
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:37,244
What happens?
Are you unhappy with the job?

599
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,648
Your brother is worried
about you,...

600
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,563
he told me to ask you
to come back home.

601
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,561
He wants you to come back...

602
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,039
and help him
run the factory.

603
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,325
Mother,...

604
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,969
I'll start to send you money
again next month.

605
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,485
I can save 15,000 yens
a month.

606
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,799
How is that?

607
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,657
She's come to see me,
she doesn't want the money any more.

608
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,045
I thought that…

609
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,362
I thought that she lived in Tokyo.

610
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,560
Not any more.
She has returned home.

611
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,080
She’s at Towada Lake,
in a hotel.

612
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:27,843
It's very close.

613
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,249
And I don't like it at all.

614
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,083
If she no longer accepts the money,
then, does that mean...

615
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,808
that she finally forgave you?

616
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,529
No, nothing of the sort.

617
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:39,763
She wants to torture
me even more.

618
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:50,163
I don't think this can
be solved with money.

619
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,439
I want my husband back.

620
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:56,682
But of course I will
have to do something,…

621
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,408
because if not…

622
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:04,085
The money you give me
cannot help me...

623
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,206
leave the pain behind.

624
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,440
Although I don't know
what else to do.

625
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,841
Please, forget what happened.
I will try to forget it as well.

626
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:14,524
I suffer too!
Who can forget something like this?

627
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:17,728
I think I should go
to see her.

628
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,245
I think I should go to see her
and apologize.

629
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,604
No, don't do it.

630
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:24,040
It wouldn't do any good,
thrust me.

631
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:28,041
Poor son of mine.
I can't see you like this.

632
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,208
Calm down, it's all ok.

633
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,568
Everything will work out.

634
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:38,678
I will overcome this.

635
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,805
Mrs. Yumiko,
you have a visit.

636
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:35,600
- Really? Who is it?
- It's Mr. Mishima's mother.

637
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,089
Mr. Mishima's mother?

638
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,558
- Another drink.
- No, thanks, thank you very much.

639
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,085
- Come on, drink and listen to him.
- All right.

640
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,606
Honestly, I believe this time
you are asking too much from me.

641
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,523
You exaggerate.

642
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,284
Somebody on your position
can help me.

643
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:06,484
If I own the forest, the business
will work and everybody will win.

644
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,403
Ok, I'll try.

645
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:11,730
Go call Yumiko,
tell her Mr. Inohue is here.

646
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,006
- No, it's ok. I have to go now.
- Don't leave!

647
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,365
At least give her the present.

648
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:21,241
I have only come to ask you
to forgive my son.

649
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:26,049
He came home drunk
last night, like many others.

650
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,646
It's been a while now...

651
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,607
I see him very worried.

652
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:33,558
He spends the night crying.

653
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,285
If he found out…

654
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,725
If he found out
I came to see you,...

655
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:40,484
I'm sure he would get
really mad at me.

656
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:42,404
But I can't…

657
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,208
I can't see him
suffer like this.

658
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:48,565
I know words don't
make up for anything, but...

659
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:51,165
I ask you to forgive him,
please.

660
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:53,201
Look, everything is
in the past now.

661
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,084
Now if you excuse me…

662
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,487
Mr. Inohue is here.

663
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:08,769
Don't you want to see him?
Come say "hello".

664
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,569
He says he's going to give
you a present.

665
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,249
I don't want presents.

666
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:15,482
- I cannot accept anything from him.
- Sure you can accept it.

667
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:20,443
You'd help my man only by entering
to say "hello". Just to salute him, eh?

668
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,646
I won't marry again,
you already know that.

669
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,688
Don't be stupid,
who is talking about marrying?

670
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:27,559
You come?

671
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,003
You are such a stubborn!

672
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,528
All right, whatever.

673
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:35,005
- You aren't mad?
- Who is that woman?

674
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:36,839
I'm sorry.

675
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,082
- Have you already eaten?
- Yes.

676
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,558
Listen, Mishima.

677
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,687
The manager called from Tokyo
this morning and said…

678
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,640
that you have requested
the transfer. Is that true?

679
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,203
Yes, Sir.

680
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,881
Excuse me for not having told you.

681
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,604
You have given life
to our office...

682
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,442
and I thank
you for that.

683
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,807
Nevertheless,
I also understand that…

684
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,484
you don't like to live
in a small town like this one.

685
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,402
No. It's not that.

686
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,202
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

687
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,519
See you later.

688
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,601
- Has that lady left?
- Yes.

689
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,726
Ok. Listen, I wanted
to tell you something...

690
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,768
The girls at the club give a party,
would you like to go?

691
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:31,965
The girls at the club?

692
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,849
All the hotel owners
are members.

693
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,570
We give a party every year
to drown our sorrows.

694
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,886
- I really need to laugh.
- That's what I wanted to hear.

695
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,934
Let's have some fun, eh?

696
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:48,766
Listen, Mr. Inohue is still here.
Don't you want to see him?

697
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:52,728
- You are stubborn too!
- You didn't know that?

698
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,844
Clients are going to be here soon.
Receive them, ok?

699
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:58,760
Wait. Let me serve you,
I know what you drink.

700
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,842
- Your sister told me. Come on.
- Thanks.

701
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:13,609
She also told me
your husband died in an accident.

702
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:17,926
Yes.

703
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,960
- Water, please.
- Yes.

704
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:31,005
Mrs. Eda.

705
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:37,049
Are you ok?

706
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,563
I am not Mrs. Eda.

707
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,204
I am Yumiko Shinoe.

708
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:46,525
Yes, of course.

709
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:49,919
Be careful.

710
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:51,805
Leave me.

711
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,924
It would have never imagined
that I would see you here.

712
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,479
I came to bring
some clients.

713
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:01,210
- They book here often.
- All right.

714
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,384
And I also wanted
to see you.

715
00:59:07,385 --> 00:59:09,584
I, on the contrary,
didn't want to see you.

716
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,645
Your mother came
to see me last week.

717
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,606
She told me a lot about you.

718
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,285
I'm sorry.
It was all her idea.

719
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,200
She explained me some
things about you.

720
00:59:27,284 --> 00:59:29,197
That you have always been
a good guy,...

721
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:31,962
that you didn't cry at the hospital,
that you are honest…

722
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:38,288
Why do we have to meet?

723
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:42,170
I try to forget you
and you show up again.

724
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:47,608
Go away and don't come back.

725
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,202
Go far away...

726
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,445
so I don't have
to see you again.

727
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,318
Yumiko!

728
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,279
Get ready, come on.

729
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,999
- Have any clients arrived?
- Mr. Mishima. Do you know him?

730
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:36,926
Yes.

731
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:40,684
Have this, drink.

732
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,961
- And you?
- Thank you very much.

733
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,329
He's from Meiji commercial company,
we have to look after him.

734
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:00,244
His company receives
many clients,...

735
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,889
we have to make
a good impression.

736
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:05,559
But tell me the truth,
where do you know him from?

737
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,643
Tokyo.

738
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,479
Don't tell me he's
an old love...

739
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,406
A national park is ok,...

740
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:16,564
but you could have
some geishas.

741
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:19,607
What do you think?
Am I right?

742
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,319
Seriously, isn't there
any geishas?

743
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:23,187
No.

744
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:27,525
Excuse me.

745
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:38,085
So you knew
Mr. Mishima in Tokyo, eh?

746
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,846
In which part of Tokyo
did you meet?

747
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:49,683
How intimate
have you been?

748
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,600
- Could you bring more sake?
- Yes.

749
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:56,448
Don't run away now.

750
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:57,679
Mr. Mishima,...

751
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:00,638
could we say she was
just an acquaintance?

752
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,285
- That is right.
- I doubt it very much.

753
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,088
- Just visiting?
- Yes.

754
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:15,559
Thanks.

755
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:20,885
See you later.

756
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,285
Excuse me.

757
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,890
- Have this, do you want some?
- No.

758
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,563
I have come to say goodbye.

759
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,522
I've asked them to transfer me,
as you wanted.

760
01:02:57,890 --> 01:02:59,369
I hope you feel better...

761
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,482
now that I won't be here.

762
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:06,879
Seat down.

763
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,165
Look,...

764
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:22,396
what happened to
your husband was an accident.

765
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:25,438
And I want you to know that
although you don't say anything,...

766
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:29,449
it will always be a heavy cross
for me. I am the only culprit.

767
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,125
That's right.

768
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:36,086
After a time, you refused
to accept my money,...

769
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:38,450
you said that you
no longer wanted it...

770
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,367
because you wanted
to forget the past,...

771
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:43,729
but that's a lie,
you enjoy torturing me.

772
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,679
That's not true.

773
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:47,803
I did it to forget.

774
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,969
I wanted to forget everything,
that's why I rejected the money.

775
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,481
Why the cold stare then?

776
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,561
Look, I wish you the best,...

777
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:05,609
I would do anything
to make you happy.

778
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,921
You want me to go away...

779
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:10,922
and you see, I go away.

780
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:15,127
But your stare...

781
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,288
is always torturing me.

782
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:21,079
Mrs. Shinoe,...

783
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:22,805
smile.

784
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,649
Smile, please.

785
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,922
Take care of my clients.

786
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:25,329
- A coffee.
- Yes.

787
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,763
You forgot this at the hotel.
I found it.

788
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:41,403
Well, I thank you very much.

789
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:46,200
I was drunk the other day.

790
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,727
It did not mean
what I said.

791
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,325
I apologize.

792
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:52,400
It's ok.

793
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,160
When I got drunk
the other night...

794
01:05:55,256 --> 01:05:57,287
I didn't behave
properly either.

795
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:05,239
How rude you are!

796
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:06,843
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

797
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,519
It forgot this is your
home town.

798
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:15,720
People may seem
a little coarse,...

799
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:18,086
but they're good
people, I can assure you.

800
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:21,802
Yes: In fact, it's the same
in my home town.

801
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:32,845
Mr. Mishima.

802
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,686
- The director is waiting for you.
- Ok, I'll be right there.

803
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,568
Before I leave...

804
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:45,279
I would like to take a boat
ride on the lake.

805
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:47,044
Would you like to join me?

806
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:48,200
Yes,...

807
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,645
of course.

808
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,841
Have they told you
when you'll leave?

809
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:56,966
Not yet, but I'll know soon.

810
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:01,000
I am glad
we have been able…

811
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:02,844
to meet like this.

812
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:15,840
Have you heard
about Nishino?

813
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:19,888
No, I never hear about
anything!

814
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,683
Has anything
happened to him?

815
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:25,802
They transferred him
to Lahore last year.

816
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,325
The consulate informed that he
disappeared a few weeks ago.

817
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:32,526
They say he suffered
a nervous breakdown.

818
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:33,839
And disappeared?

819
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:35,967
Well, he was completely crazy.

820
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:39,722
The company wants
to replace to him.

821
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:41,638
They chose you.

822
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:51,962
I would prefer to help it.

823
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,158
Will I go to Lahore?

824
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:57,720
It is a horrible place,
it is in West Pakistan.

825
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:01,759
A solitary office, and it's where
the cholera come from.

826
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:06,283
Two thousand people died
in Dacca because of the smallpox.

827
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:10,721
Since you demanded
the transfer,...

828
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:13,245
I did the impossible
to make it happen.

829
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:17,085
You have been a fool.
You already have what you wanted.

830
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:26,360
Drink.

831
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:30,245
The order will arrive
in a few days.

832
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:34,164
You'll have to hold about
three years in that place.

833
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:39,121
-The bill.
- Yes.

834
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:43,649
Yumiko, do me a favor…

835
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:46,047
I already told you,
I won't marry again.

836
01:08:46,048 --> 01:08:46,847
That's not it.

837
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,201
This problem is mine.

838
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:52,449
Your sister has fought
with my wife again.

839
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:55,121
It happens often, but…

840
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:57,805
She is too proud.

841
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:01,167
“That's me, there's nothing I can do”,
that's what she says.

842
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:05,926
What do you want me to do?
It's your fault, you are a married man.

843
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,084
Is something wrong?

844
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:18,244
I come from the meeting with
the union, and I felt despised.

845
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:19,968
Yes? And why was that?

846
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:22,360
You should ask
your wife.

847
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:24,328
She spreads rumors
about me.

848
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:27,084
She's a bitch, a lizard
and has no shame.

849
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:30,244
She speaks of me
as if I were a whore.

850
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:32,848
She's going to find
who I am.

851
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:39,958
No, don't call her.

852
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:41,439
Leave me!

853
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,218
- Leave the telephone.
- Leave me!

854
01:09:43,276 --> 01:09:45,282
She is going to find out
who says the truth.

855
01:09:45,363 --> 01:09:46,929
I told you not to call her.

856
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:48,726
Sister!

857
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:51,246
- I must call her.
- Stop!

858
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:55,170
- You hit me!
- Stop already, please!

859
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:57,884
You are a revolting pig!
Leave right now!

860
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:59,244
Of course I'll leave!

861
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,640
Pardon, would you mind
changing seats with me?

862
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:26,644
- What?
- Would you change seats with me?

863
01:11:28,090 --> 01:11:29,318
Take another one.

864
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:32,449
She is my wife.

865
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:34,039
Well,...

866
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,083
in that case…

867
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:40,803
Thank you very much.

868
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:48,805
- Have you spent the morning in Aomori?
- Yes.

869
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:51,089
What a coincidence!

870
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:55,600
- Would you like some chocolate?
- No.

871
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:58,006
What about some cookies?
Peanuts?

872
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:00,080
Gum?

873
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,849
Are you feeling ok?

874
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:41,919
I have temperature.

875
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,439
Let's go to the shore.

876
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:45,488
I 'm sure it's nothing.

877
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:33,441
I'll ask when the bus arrives.

878
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,843
There's still 40 minutes.
Come, let's go.

879
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,205
Where?

880
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:07,878
To that hotel over there, we'll be
fine there. They know me.

881
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,046
No.

882
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:10,925
Why not?

883
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,443
You have to go home.

884
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:19,206
We are at the other side of the lake.
How am I going to go without the bus?

885
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:22,918
It's starting to get cold.
It will get worse here.

886
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,802
Why are they looking at us?

887
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:34,279
They look at us
as if we were criminals.

888
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:36,566
I don't know,
we haven't done anything wrong.

889
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:39,528
Don't pay attention to them.
Come, let's go.

890
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:40,999
No.

891
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:44,816
It wouldn't take long before they
started talking trash about you.

892
01:14:44,874 --> 01:14:47,607
That's not a big deal,
don't you think? Come on, let's go.

893
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,324
You are very stubborn.

894
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,926
I was born like this,
what can I do?

895
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,278
That's your bus.

896
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:20,858
Run and take it. If you miss it,
you'll have to wait for an hour.

897
01:15:20,954 --> 01:15:22,268
Take it, please.

898
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:25,362
I'm stubborn too.

899
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:41,125
Ok.

900
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:44,768
We better get some
place to shelter,...

901
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:48,884
but not the hotel;
they know you there.

902
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:50,885
Ok.

903
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:05,480
Do you already know
where they are going to send you?

904
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,444
They said…

905
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,642
they will send me
to another country.

906
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:11,925
Abroad?

907
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:17,406
But I believe that's very fortunate.

908
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,881
Maybe I can be happy
in another country,...

909
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:32,645
leaving you unhappy
here in Japan.

910
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,643
There's still 15 minutes left.

911
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,322
The temperature
is raising.

912
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:58,362
We better go to the hotel.

913
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:07,363
You have very
high temperature.

914
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:09,920
Give him ice
to keep him cold.

915
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,320
Give him this
every four hours.

916
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:15,845
Temperature should begin
to drop soon,...

917
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:18,888
but it won't disappear until tomorrow.
If something happens, call me.

918
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:20,529
Thank you very much,
doctor.

919
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:39,489
Hello, Yumiko.
What happens?

920
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:42,362
He's fine.

921
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:45,047
Ok. don't worry,
but come back early.

922
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:47,644
Hayashida is here.
Be still!

923
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:50,608
Hayashida says he's going
to divorce his wife.

924
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:52,328
But I don't know,
we will see.

925
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:54,641
You can't trust men.

926
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,368
Stop already!

927
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:20,449
Don't stay…

928
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:35,647
- You must leave.
- Yes.

929
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:38,526
You must leave.

930
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:40,801
- Take it.
- You must leave.

931
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:43,723
Yes. Take it.
You will feel better.

932
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:56,518
You must leave.

933
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:39,839
I'm very sorry.

934
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:44,928
I am better.
You must leave.

935
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:52,725
Don't worry about me
and get some rest.

936
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,488
Try to sleep a little.

937
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:11,724
Yumiko,...

938
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:17,841
I feel as I were falling.

939
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,407
Give me your hand,
I'm falling into an abyss.

940
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,764
I'm sorry, I can't
eat anything.

941
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:46,608
Well, take the medicine.

942
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,408
It's been four hours.

943
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:02,166
And the bus, what time
does it get here?

944
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,763
In twenty minutes.

945
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:07,442
- Can you walk?
- Yes.

946
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:11,808
You haven't slept
all night, have you?

947
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:13,525
Don't worry.

948
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:16,648
- I'll sleep when I get home.
- I'm sorry...

949
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:18,888
I caused you
so much troubles.

950
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,768
I'll be transferred...

951
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:26,489
to Lahore, you know?

952
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:28,680
To Lahore?

953
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:35,645
I won't be able to thank you
for what you've done before I leave.

954
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,326
But, you have already
made up your mind?

955
01:22:41,850 --> 01:22:42,680
Yes.

956
01:22:53,330 --> 01:22:55,890
I thought they would
send me to Hokkaido...

957
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,688
and finally they
didn't.

958
01:22:58,370 --> 01:23:00,838
In Lahore there is cholera
and other diseases.

959
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,803
Nobody wants to go there because
they're afraid of getting it.

960
01:23:03,842 --> 01:23:05,545
That is not more
than a legend.

961
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:07,368
It is a modern city now.

962
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:10,240
How do you know that?

963
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:14,800
In Tokyo I used to talk
to some neighbors...

964
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:16,767
who traveled a lot...

965
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:19,046
Lahore, Dacca, Laos,...

966
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:20,803
Saigon, Karachi…

967
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:23,404
They always said you couldn't
go to those places.

968
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,726
Well, that was before,
now things have changed.

969
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,648
I believe this is what I need,...

970
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,843
maybe I will be able
to redeem myself this way.

971
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:47,200
I don't understand how come Yumiko
has already decided to choose a man.

972
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:49,201
Inohue will feel
disappointed.

973
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:51,640
I believe you are
the one disappointed.

974
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:52,799
Don't be a fool.

975
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:54,801
- I am here.
- Hello, Yumiko.

976
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,358
Listen, come here.

977
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:00,687
I didn't tell you everything
when we talk.

978
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,482
What happened exactly?

979
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:05,322
My friend wasn't feeling ok.

980
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:08,050
- Your friend? What friend?
- Mr. Mishima.

981
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,325
Mr. Mishima…?

982
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:11,640
Ah, the one from Meiji
commercial company, right?

983
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,045
Yes.

984
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:15,603
Then, you two are…

985
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:19,286
No, we are not lovers.

986
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:24,128
We could never be.

987
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:27,321
You never know,
don't you think?

988
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:30,804
I do know, because he took
everything away from me.

989
01:24:30,970 --> 01:24:34,164
- I cannot love him.
- What did he take away from you?

990
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,840
He's the one who killed
my husband.

991
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:39,366
He was…?

992
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:42,165
Was he the driver who
ran over him?

993
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:44,924
Do you think I could
love that man?

994
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:48,324
And now if you excuse
me, I'll go lie down.

995
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:54,287
Inohue can still
have hope.

996
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,513
- Good morning.
- Ah, good morning.

997
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,474
- What train are you going to take?
- I haven't decided yet.

998
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,600
And what are you
doing after the celebration?

999
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,954
To drink, I suppose.

1000
01:25:39,169 --> 01:25:42,234
I'll go out
to see my clients, ok?

1001
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,428
Listen, if you don't want to be
alone tonight, I would love to...

1002
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,034
Tell Mr. Kawai that I will
leave tomorrow night.

1003
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,430
I suppose he'll like
to know in advance.

1004
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,599
What you are doing?

1005
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,234
Oh, I'm sorry.
I scared you, didn't I?

1006
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:51,875
I'm sorry.

1007
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,319
You are a bad boy.

1008
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,400
- What were you thinking about?
- Nothing.

1009
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,033
I wish you had said
you were thinking about me.

1010
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,998
I see you feel ok already.

1011
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,194
Yes, I'm ok now.
Thank you very much.

1012
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,279
Could you give me some water?
I'm thirsty.

1013
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,434
Great!

1014
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,830
The sky is so blue.

1015
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,678
You are really
a bad boy.

1016
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:50,149
There's some of your lipstick
on the glass.

1017
01:27:50,188 --> 01:27:53,635
- But I'm not using any lipstick today.
- No? Then…

1018
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,632
I brought you a present.

1019
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:02,311
- It's from Tokyo.
- Thanks. I needed it.

1020
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,638
Herbs?

1021
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,559
Let me help you.

1022
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:14,799
This is “kogomi”, right?

1023
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,589
It is “Shidoke”.

1024
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,358
- And this one?
- “Kogomi”.

1025
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,833
Summer is nice.

1026
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,476
It's my favorite
season.

1027
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,632
- Yes?
- I wish it will never ends.

1028
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,115
After summer
comes winter.

1029
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,319
Winter is nice too.

1030
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:43,959
You are funny.

1031
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,670
The truth is
I like everything:...

1032
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,474
winter, summer,
sidoke, kogomi…

1033
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,429
Everything.

1034
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:55,556
- Do you already know when you'll leave?
- What?

1035
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,952
I leave in a few days.

1036
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,393
- What are the herbs for?
- To make preserves.

1037
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:15,595
Preserves?

1038
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,799
Now we make preserved fruits
and other things.

1039
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,837
We save them
for the winter.

1040
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,430
I think we are a little
like badgers.

1041
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,709
In autumn snow starts to fall
and it covers everything for 5 months.

1042
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,952
Even buses can't go around.

1043
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,197
We lived surrounded
by snow...

1044
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,787
until spring
melts it.

1045
01:29:34,845 --> 01:29:36,189
It is a problem.

1046
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,349
No, it's not. Why?

1047
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,476
How will I be able to come
with so much snow?

1048
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,991
I'm sorry, nobody can come.

1049
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:46,197
Only the mailman gets
here once a week to bring letters.

1050
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:47,554
Once a week?

1051
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,518
If he comes once a week,
I’ll come twice.

1052
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,033
No, three times.

1053
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,877
I will come to surprise
you as I did now.

1054
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,557
You had a beautiful smile,...

1055
01:29:58,920 --> 01:29:59,989
you seemed a little girl.

1056
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,835
Although,…

1057
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,390
you are very
sensual too.

1058
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,278
Do you want to go?

1059
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,278
Could you give me
some tea?

1060
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:34,989
Yumiko,...

1061
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:41,198
I think you already
know.

1062
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:46,639
You know I love you.

1063
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:49,279
Why do you say that?

1064
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,633
- You're going far away from here.
- That's why I say it.

1065
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:56,264
I can only think about you.
I haven't stopped thinking about you...

1066
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,151
ever since we were
in that hotel.

1067
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,794
We must go.

1068
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,028
Yumiko, come to Lahore
with me, please.

1069
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,030
No.

1070
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,278
Lahore is a horrible place,
nobody wants to go there,...

1071
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,273
...but I promise I'll make you happy.
- I'm sorry, go away.

1072
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:38,476
Don't live in the past, you have
to get over it, you have to be happy.

1073
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,629
Please.

1074
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,793
And don't come back.

1075
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,710
I have to be in Tokyo the day after
tomorrow, we can't separate like this.

1076
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,035
Think it throw.

1077
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,357
We can't erase
the past from our minds.

1078
01:31:50,453 --> 01:31:53,004
I think you're giving too much
importance to common sense.

1079
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,262
- Listen to your feelings.
- I cannot go with you.

1080
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:56,951
How could I go
with you?

1081
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,199
If we made such thing,...

1082
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:03,478
we would have to live ashamed
for the rest of our lives.

1083
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,635
- Don't you realize?
- No, really.

1084
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,474
And I don't understand.

1085
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,519
It would be too cruel.

1086
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,398
I couldn't bear
that cruelty.

1087
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,156
- Yumiko…
- You have to leave.

1088
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,034
Please, go away.

1089
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,948
Good bye.

1090
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:09,229
Good morning.

1091
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,108
Is Hayashida there?
I would like to speak with him.

1092
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,355
He's not there?

1093
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,798
But he said that…

1094
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:17,709
He's gone away?

1095
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,037
Where? Hello?

1096
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:21,675
Hello!

1097
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:25,154
Excuse me.

1098
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,951
Good morning. Is Hayashida there,
please? It would like to speak with him.

1099
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,278
I understand. Thanks.

1100
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:34,391
- What do you think? Do we do it?
- Kill ourselves? No, thanks.

1101
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:42,757
Have they found the bodies?

1102
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,598
Good morning.
Is Mr. Mishima, please?

1103
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,914
Yes, I understand.
No, don't bother.

1104
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,391
Do you know
what time he leaves?

1105
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,109
Nine thirty?

1106
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,438
Thank you very much.

1107
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,389
This is your fault.

1108
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:27,755
- Really? Why?
- You already know why.

1109
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,276
No, I don't.
Tell me why it's my fault, come on.

1110
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,948
Mr. Mishima,
come down, you have a visit.

1111
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,359
Well, what happens?

1112
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,353
An accident.

1113
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,198
- Welcome.
- Do you have a room?

1114
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,351
Yes, come on in, please.

1115
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,278
My love! My love!

1116
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,839
No, please!

1117
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,953
I'm so sorry.

1118
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,113
Excuse me.

1119
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,159
The bath is ready.

1120
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,233
Serve dinner, please.

1121
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,592
Yes, Sir. Whatever you say.
I'll be right back.

1122
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,874
Forgive me.

1123
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,310
I rowed with you
in Towada Lake,...

1124
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:17,033
I collected herbs with you
in the countryside,...

1125
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:22,111
I let you take care of me
when I was ill…

1126
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,279
I am the one who
should apologize, it's my fault.

1127
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,112
Because I loved you.

1128
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:44,798
Let's drink.

1129
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:02,788
Come on, you too.

1130
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,317
What do you want to toast to?

1131
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,519
Don't be sad.

1132
01:45:23,063 --> 01:45:24,598
At heart I am a Barbarian,...

1133
01:45:25,112 --> 01:45:27,952
I prefer Lahore
to any European city.

1134
01:45:35,322 --> 01:45:37,143
Do you know what
I'm going to do?

1135
01:45:37,293 --> 01:45:39,514
I'll sing you a local song,
as a farewell.

1136
01:45:40,907 --> 01:45:43,877
They say anyone who
listens to this song...

1137
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:45,439
reach happiness.

1138
01:45:48,637 --> 01:45:50,670
I am sure
you will be happy.
