1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,200
I regret to say that
entry is not included

2
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,503
the tour price.
Sorry.

3
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,189
Here must pay.

4
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,279
But, good news
are only 10 szlotys.

5
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:27,573
So no
so bad.

6
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:32,958
Sorry

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,582
Trial Of God

8
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,564
It is forbidden to take pictures.

9
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:55,652
Photography groups
are by appointment only.

10
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,280
When you get there,

11
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,934
give him your card
the good doctor.

12
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:10,406
The examined.

13
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:11,407
Free.

14
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:14,306
Do not say that I
care about you.

15
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:17,733
This is a typical hut.

16
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:20,336
They had to
thousand people here.

17
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:23,942
When I got a new transport
made space for...

18
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:26,123
well, you can imagine.

19
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:27,713
Were
a selection.

20
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:30,317
Each cabin in
was given a card

21
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:33,655
for older
on the block, the overseer,

22
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:35,790
and then go
the selected area.

23
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:42,840
Straight.
Come on, shoulders back.

24
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:46,091
Stop.

25
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:48,279
Do not move well.

26
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,410
You look like dead.

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,196
Leave me alone.
... You're dead.

28
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,536
Try not to see you angry,
or be the next.. (I'll be fine)

29
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:56,837
I taught my
numbers? See?

30
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:00,286
Add them, 18, 18,
is the number of life.

31
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:05,440
You can meet up soon
Lord your God with.

32
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:10,614
It's very cold here, yes?

33
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,195
Imagine the day
selection.

34
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:17,232
Nobody knew what was the
selection criterion,

35
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:20,270
so all
afraid.

36
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,987
Well, this way.

37
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,209
I do not understand.

38
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:30,286
Do not see how this could happen.

39
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:32,041
How could afford?

40
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,238
You know there
a story

41
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:35,458
that prisoners
set up a tribunal here

42
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:37,435
and conducted a trial.

43
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:39,313
Prosecute
they thought

44
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:42,400
was mainly responsible
for what happened to them.

45
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:46,155
Can you imagine the look
my wife?

46
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,841
Suppose if I need
someone to wash dishes.

47
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:51,513
Move.

48
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:53,438
These people wait
see the doctor!

49
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:54,929
Become Wait and see
by the physician.

50
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:01,494
Jewish 85 years
in my house.

51
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:04,048
What I do
with her?

52
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:06,701
Some things
he can think.

53
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,484
Move.

54
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,756
Send the old Kuhn
left.

55
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,892
If you go left, you'll
to heaven with the old Kuhn.

56
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:42,284
Other live.
Silence.

57
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:43,925
Just point out the facts.

58
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,967
live.

59
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:49,052
you die.

60
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,525
Have you sent the right?

61
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,265
Right.

62
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:55,169
And you?

63
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:56,554
Left.

64
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,774
Was nice meeting you.

65
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,453
Come here. In!

66
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:08,755
In!

67
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:13,044
In!

68
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:14,830
Come on. In!
In!

69
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:17,433
Your notif..!

70
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:20,904
Come on! Move!

71
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:22,207
Move!

72
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:26,980
Move, move!,

73
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,042
Thanks to the efficiency

74
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:39,131
rail system of the Reich
this pile of steaming

75
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:41,542
Polish garbage has
arrived a day early.

76
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:43,904
Those of you
that have been selected,

77
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:47,142
know to which sleep
morning in their beds.

78
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:52,582
See this?

79
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:54,318
You know what I mean?

80
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,620
It means that I am a criminal.

81
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:57,356
A convicted criminal.

82
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:00,498
What are you?

83
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:02,838
Lawyers?

84
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:05,234
Doctors?

85
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:08,143
I spit out there.

86
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:09,940
Well, here,
is the opposite.

87
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,110
Here I am king.

88
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,263
Chancellor.

89
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,381
I am president.

90
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:16,450
Fuührer. God I.

91
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:21,222
The world just flip them
and you will have fallen into.

92
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:23,392
It is better
become accustomed.

93
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,278
This is a terrible place.

94
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:41,949
But if you help us,

95
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:43,353
it did.

96
00:05:45,143 --> 00:05:47,068
The day of liberation

97
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:48,994
each day is approaching.

98
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:51,114
War will end

99
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,334
and with the aid of
God will see.

100
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:54,586
frankly,

101
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:56,371
should sleep on the
floor tonight

102
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:58,999
but if either of you
sick,

103
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:01,578
are those who
give their beds.

104
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,831
Monsieur,

105
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:04,182
In what part is?

106
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:05,484
Lyon.

107
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,654
I had a cousin there.

108
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,260
Contini was called.
Do you know him?

109
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:14,015
Everyone knew him.

110
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,524
He was a doctor.

111
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,635
A very fat,
with lots of money.

112
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:20,163
He escaped,
Any idea?

113
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:21,490
Maybe.

114
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,564
I have not heard.

115
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,012
Open your mouth.

116
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:30,219
Lucky you.

117
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,256
Let me grab this
gold tooth,

118
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,477
I'll give you half
my weekly ration yeah?

119
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,897
I need my tooth
to eat.

120
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:41,935
Do not worry
for that.

121
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,621
Not to eat
much here

122
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,840
Do not worry, keep your
tooth while you can.

123
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,010
Let me get him out.
It only takes a minute.

124
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,821
Here.

125
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:57,991
You'll need it.

126
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:02,153
Soup is the only food..
You'll need every drop.

127
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:03,320
How about you?

128
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,291
I was sent to the left.

129
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:11,009
Take it.

130
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:14,219
If you do not, one of
Kapos will.

131
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:23,416
He has expressed
their favor... Kuhn

132
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,102
We are his people.

133
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:28,228
He has shown his favor.
What are you praying for?

134
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,122
What will these
praying?

135
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:32,529
That is not you?

136
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:33,781
That will be me

137
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,349
instead of you?
Of course not.

138
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,818
Moshe?, Let him alone.
Who then?

139
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:39,895
If not me, who?
C'mon, name them, choose

140
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,691
Moshe?, Shut up.

141
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:44,245
At times like this,
You should pray for you.

142
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,547
Someone else reads?

143
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:50,372
Someone else is helping
God to decide?

144
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,947
I'm praying for him.

145
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,003
It is the rabbi
of Zamkevitz.

146
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:59,433
Melamed and is a healer.
Healer!

147
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:03,264
This interrupt
his work, no?

148
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,640
All we are healed.

149
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:07,416
They say it is
one of 36.

150
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:09,941
36 What?

151
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:12,745
36 rabbis Russians
that groan?

152
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,248
The Lamed-vovnik.

153
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:18,526
The holy secret
We carry on their shoulders

154
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,646
They have put their
souls in God,

155
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:23,300
and for their sake,
He does not destroy.

156
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,904
Gypsy piece of scum!

157
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:26,771
Please.

158
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,374
The Lord our God
can hear you, even here.

159
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:31,544
He listens to me, not
does anything about it.

160
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,797
Moreover bastard
I thought.

161
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,017
He listens to me and not
nothing.

162
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,185
It's an evil bastard.

163
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:42,120
He should be here
not us.

164
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,765
We should prosecute
the bastard.

165
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,355
So perhaps we listen.

166
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:55,298
And what will you do if
is guilty?

167
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:55,845
Arrest him?

168
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,047
Or wait to be delivered?

169
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:02,789
They can stop this?

170
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,630
They can stop
this blasphemy?

171
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,561
In fact, there
be blasphemy.

172
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:12,335
Abraham negotiated with
God for Sodom.

173
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,373
Jacob wrestled
with the angel.

174
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:17,492
The name, Israel,

175
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:20,335
means "he who has
struggled with God ".

176
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:21,930
Basta.

177
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:26,655
Tomorrow, we could be
facing our creator.

178
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,715
And tomorrow, our Creator
could enfréntanos.

179
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:32,680
It is a very old story.

180
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,799
Many who are
know the story.

181
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,551
It gives some sense.

182
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:40,234
Why not prosecute?
At least had to listen.

183
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,857
Not needed
judges and others?

184
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:44,163
three justices.

185
00:09:44,198 --> 00:09:45,862
For a rabbinical court,
need to three.

186
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:46,886
Part of the tragedy
this place

187
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,087
is that it was packed
of scientists, artists, lawyers.

188
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:51,390
Baumgarten.

189
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:55,975
Yes, I was professor of
criminal law in Berlin.

190
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,804
Teach bright
students and admired.

191
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,513
I ate at a large table.

192
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:04,841
Coffee, brandy and
conversations with men

193
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:08,313
who are now..
in their government.

194
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:12,218
I do not know much
of the Torah.

195
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,993
There are many here
who know the Torah.

196
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:17,852
But I know how
lead a court.

197
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:28,225
Sorry.

198
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:29,526
"I knew you...

199
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,395
a teacher
in college?

200
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,474
Excuse me,...
Could you...

201
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:36,519
I do not have much time.

202
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:41,109
I do not want to waste
my last hours on this.

203
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,197
Look,

204
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,367
if we are to continue
through with this,

205
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:49,487
we can at least
ask the saint,

206
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:53,708
that God has someone
to defend him?.. Rabbi..

207
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:55,612
Rabbi.

208
00:10:56,914 --> 00:10:59,084
They ask whether
talk to them.

209
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,122
It is a fool.

210
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:05,593
Look, I'm a rabbi.

211
00:11:06,345 --> 00:11:07,712
I have translated
psalms.

212
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:10,148
I've written several
books on law.

213
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:13,043
I wrote a piece for our
theater in Wotchz... Sorry

214
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:18,612
Professor Schmidt?

215
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,819
Idek?

216
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:26,856
They said that they had
come to America.

217
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:30,327
Nobody has escaped?

218
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:37,221
I might serve
Dayan.

219
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:42,044
Idek is the best student
I have taught.

220
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:43,295
I'll stand up..

221
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:45,392
he does not.
please.

222
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:47,439
Please stay
out of it.

223
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,534
Strictly speaking,
the dayan

224
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:50,710
should be a rabbi.

225
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:52,820
Are you a rabbi?

226
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:55,443
The dayan is the
question, right?

227
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:58,478
I have a lot of questions.
Idek is a brilliant scholar.

228
00:11:58,513 --> 00:11:59,352
His knowledge of
Torah is...

229
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,572
Auschwitz was not
mentioned in Torah

230
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:03,690
That's the point.

231
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,910
So I am a father
of this court,

232
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,514
Baumgarten is the boss
of the court.

233
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,502
And our
friend here

234
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:14,538
is, dayan, the Inquisitor.

235
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:21,179
For a point of order, for
that this court is lawful,

236
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:23,217
should have a
copy of the Torah.

237
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:23,691
...We

238
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,388
as evidence...

239
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:28,542
of its existence here.

240
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:30,851
Well, I'll sniff
at the library

241
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:31,835
and get one, no?

242
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:34,117
They want something more
while I'm gone?

243
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,368
Girls?

244
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:37,104
Cigarettes?

245
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:38,889
Cushions for their
bony back?

246
00:12:39,706 --> 00:12:41,529
Rabbi Akiva
has been learned

247
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,352
all our holy
memory writes.

248
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:45,242
Recites
constantly.

249
00:12:45,456 --> 00:12:48,621
In these sad days, we have been
a source of freshwater

250
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,523
He is called
"The Living Torah".

251
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:57,066
Sorry.

252
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:58,417
Over here, Rabbi.

253
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,089
So, for starters.

254
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:08,818
Who is charged?

255
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:09,715
Yo.

256
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:11,729
I will.

257
00:13:12,304 --> 00:13:14,039
What are the charges?

258
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:15,775
Of which he is charged?

259
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:17,996
You see?

260
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,823
Murder...

261
00:13:20,858 --> 00:13:22,574
collaboration, murder!

262
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,888
You know what
did to my mother?

263
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:26,214
My sister?

264
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,441
My brothers?

265
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:31,044
Murder, partnership,
and more murders.

266
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,699
I think we should
be more precise.

267
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,212
Suffering is part
God's plan.

268
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,422
A child knows that.

269
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:38,773
"If we take happiness
the hand of God,

270
00:13:38,823 --> 00:13:40,509
we should not take
pain, too? "

271
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:42,413
It is not
an indictment.

272
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:45,850
Are you saying that
no reasons?

273
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,064
The charge would be

274
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:48,249
breach of contract.

275
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,536
The Jews
have a...

276
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:50,738
have a contract
God,

277
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,524
some kind of
special arrangement.

278
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:53,826
A pact.

279
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,297
Well, the accusation is that
broke the agreement, the pact.

280
00:13:57,347 --> 00:14:00,886
Therefore, God is a
cheating bastard!

281
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,981
That is fine with me.

282
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:03,968
Please, please.

283
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:05,865
They can stop you?

284
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,010
In the desert, Moses led
a covenant with God.

285
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:11,111
He said the people
obey God's law,

286
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:14,465
and on the other hand, God said
of all peoples,

287
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,844
we would be theirs,

288
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,993
his chosen

289
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:19,597
a priestly nation

290
00:14:19,632 --> 00:14:21,163
The psalmist sings

291
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:24,927
"I agreed with the chosen one, I swear
my servant David.

292
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,748
"I did sign your dynasty
forever.

293
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,163
Your throne will last
from age to age.

294
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:31,579
My own translation.

295
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:33,418
Therefore the case
before us

296
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:35,484
is not fulfilled
with this covenant.

297
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:37,644
Who wants to start?

298
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,257
"No enemy will
able to mock him,

299
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:42,739
"No evil overtake.

300
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,390
"Crush
his enemies before him,

301
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,301
annihilate opponents.

302
00:14:51,118 --> 00:14:52,198
So?

303
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:58,866
Has the
His promise? No.

304
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,822
Well, it's hard to see
and refute the charge.

305
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:04,992
What defense can there be?

306
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:11,169
Continue?

307
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:14,489
Bad Things

308
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,274
have happened before.

309
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:19,261
Read the Torah.

310
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:21,481
Lean... read
its history.

311
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:22,785
We are Jews.

312
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:25,733
We suffer.

313
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:27,123
Please.

314
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,580
Identify at
the court.

315
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:34,589
My name is Kuhn.

316
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:37,487
I'm his father.

317
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,141
I'm his father, and
However...

318
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:42,927
he joins them
this shame.

319
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:46,900
It helps knowing
it hurts.

320
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:49,253
That is the kind
a son he is.

321
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,423
Got something to say, father?

322
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,031
Apart from usual?

323
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,447
Look...

324
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:59,780
when we were released
of bondage in Egypt,

325
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:02,272
find land
fiancee, What happened?

326
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:06,313
We were taken captive
again in Babylon.

327
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,648
When we
released again

328
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,497
and rebuild
temple,

329
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,054
what happened?

330
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,490
The Romans razed.

331
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:23,094
What happened
on Massada...

332
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:24,978
Spain...

333
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:27,941
Russia, and now here?

334
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:29,126
I think
the witness

335
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:32,972
is saying that his failure
the contract is common.

336
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:37,366
To clarify the position,
God defend or attack

337
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:40,458
Mr. Kuhn, think this saying...
.. he can speak for itself

338
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:42,144
Our ancestors,

339
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:44,999
our ancestors,
our parents

340
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,820
all suffered.

341
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,606
But it aired.

342
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:53,637
That is the reason that
we're still here.

343
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,514
This is a test
of our faith.

344
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,303
We pass our test
as they passed his.

345
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:03,401
Do you think we
be here?... (Please...)

346
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:06,494
They kept the light of Torah
on in times of darkness.

347
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:08,472
We must do the same.

348
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,350
We must keep the faith.

349
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,569
We maintain pure
our hearts,

350
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,416
and we must pray.
Why?

351
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,066
If God has
betrayed, why?

352
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:19,337
The point is...

353
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:23,133
The point is to be a good Jew.
A good Jew.

354
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:25,131
The point is to keep the faith.
Why?

355
00:17:26,456 --> 00:17:28,811
We are
tested!

356
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,399
Tests are part
of this covenant?

357
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:37,632
Did someone mention
evidence to Moses?

358
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,990
In the same psalm,
we are told,

359
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,098
"If their descendants
deserting my law

360
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,059
"and not follow my commands,

361
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:45,664
"if they violate my decrees and does not
keep my commandments

362
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:50,007
"I will punish their offenses with the rod,
his guilt with his whip

363
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,380
Mr. Kuhn said,

364
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:54,108
before blaming God, we
look at ourselves.

365
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:57,915
Perhaps it is God who
breaches the covenant, but us.

366
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,517
Yes

367
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,090
There is... he knows.

368
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:04,694
Es.. is
mipnei khata'einu

369
00:18:05,471 --> 00:18:07,281
because of our sins.

370
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:10,052
Or your sins.

371
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:14,084
May be you
who is to blame.

372
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,623
Thank you.

373
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,793
I agree
with the court.

374
00:18:16,843 --> 00:18:18,912
It is a punishment.

375
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:20,808
The court has not said
such... (Still)

376
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:22,407
I agree.

377
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,391
Some Jews have
turned their backs on the Torah

378
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,207
They thought they knew better.

379
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,344
Our children have left
to cities.

380
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:32,513
He bought a
fancy hat,

381
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:36,873
a good costume, they became
socialists or Zionists

382
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:39,665
capitalist
or anarchists.

383
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,527
God only knows what.

384
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:44,081
Forgetting everything

385
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:47,587
of the precious scriptures.

386
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:48,904
So you're saying that

387
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:52,037
this is my fault;
is that?

388
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:57,258
God is destroying all the people
Jew because you're disappointed in me

389
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,667
Is that it?

390
00:18:58,702 --> 00:19:00,482
Look what you're doing!

391
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:03,669
A trial to God?

392
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:06,158
Do not you think
can hear you?

393
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:08,294
Do you think
not here?

394
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,601
We must maintain
order here.

395
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,853
You are Jews, no?

396
00:19:11,903 --> 00:19:14,935
If nothing else,
must respect the law.

397
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,615
Well, since I am accused,

398
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,163
I call
a witness.

399
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:22,208
Forward.
This gentleman.

400
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,773
Name?

401
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,244
Ezra Shapira
of Zamkevitz.

402
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:34,360
Did I do something wrong?

403
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:36,584
No, Ezra
Zamkevitz.

404
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,808
He came here with
Rabbi believe,

405
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:40,543
from Zamkevitz.

406
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:42,229
Tell me,
Ezra Shapira

407
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,508
turned their backs
the Torah

408
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:45,752
in Zamkevitz?

409
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,043
No, sir.

410
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:51,230
In Zamkevitz,
loved the Torah.

411
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:54,469
On Shabbat, the windows of the
shops were all closed.

412
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,674
The Scriptures wrapped its wings
of quiet about us,

413
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:00,156
and the world simply
vanished.

414
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:03,011
Every man had
his prayer book.

415
00:20:03,107 --> 00:20:06,802
On national holidays, festivals,
workdays,

416
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:08,455
the Torah was...

417
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:11,737
The air was
that breathed.

418
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:14,387
In our poverty,
We dressed and housed us.

419
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,440
He was our palace

420
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,432
and lived
in its splendor.

421
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:19,403
So what went wrong?

422
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:22,710
They came.

423
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:26,379
They killed all
the elderly.

424
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:28,802
And they did the rest
bury them.

425
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:32,785
I buried my own mother.

426
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,602
I did remove the
ring fingers

427
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:35,700
and give it to them.

428
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,169
See any reason why
God would be a good Jew

429
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:42,724
desecrate the grave
your own mother

430
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,199
in order to punish
a poor Jewish

431
00:20:45,562 --> 00:20:46,729
For example, I?

432
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:49,541
I said that was
a good man.

433
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:54,638
I try, but I do not know if I am a good man,
I do not know if you are an evil man.

434
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,614
For example, he.

435
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,520
I do not know.

436
00:21:00,153 --> 00:21:01,255
Know me already

437
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,425
Do not worry.

438
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:10,609
So God reserves the right
to punish the wicked.

439
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,457
This is in the covenant.

440
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:17,747
The question is, why did you choose
punish this good man here...

441
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,349
...and not, for
example, Hitler?

442
00:21:23,494 --> 00:21:25,935
Does anyone have
an answer?

443
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,280
God is just;

444
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,933
so we have
done something wrong.

445
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:36,632
We should examine
our consciences.

446
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:39,876
In law, the punishment
should be proportional

447
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:42,046
crime.

448
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:44,165
What crime

449
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:47,534
may justify a
punished like this?

450
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:51,920
And children, some children
on the field.

451
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:55,835
What punishment is
deserves a child?

452
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:01,140
If I may?

453
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:03,259
Not long

454
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:05,044
the punishment is proportional.

455
00:22:05,094 --> 00:22:06,588
The flood engulfed
Worldwide

456
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:08,032
with the exception of Noah.

457
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:10,721
God asked Abraham to
sacrifice his own son.

458
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:11,553
Sir, my mother was

459
00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:12,856
a good woman.

460
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:15,885
The mistake is to make
it's personal.

461
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,497
God does not work
against the person.

462
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:21,210
His alliance is with
the Jewish people,

463
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:22,691
Ezra not
of Zamkevitz.

464
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,524
This is not personal.

465
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:26,257
Can I ask you, Ezra,

466
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:29,345
see any object in a
God is not personal?

467
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,126
God as the object?

468
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:34,921
Does it depend on me
use to find God?

469
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,280
Do you know what is a god
that is not personal?

470
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:39,868
No.

471
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,542
Is the weather
That's all.

472
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:46,182
Maybe we should eliminate the word now
punishment procedures

473
00:22:46,217 --> 00:22:47,976
Can I ask a question?

474
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:51,574
Ezra, let me ask you,

475
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:54,194
Your mother was a good Jew?

476
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:57,268
How can you ask
So even here?

477
00:22:57,303 --> 00:22:59,275
Let me talk about something.

478
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,167
Let's talk
purification.

479
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:02,709
Twice in history,

480
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:06,182
and perhaps here today again
God has done events occur

481
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,690
of such destruction,

482
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:09,267
that after this, nothing
was the same again.

483
00:23:09,317 --> 00:23:10,953
Nothing was the same

484
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,740
because, over time,
we come to understand

485
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,065
all improved.

486
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:17,441
Imagine that God
is a surgeon,

487
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:23,407
and has to remove a leg or an arm
with gangrene to heal the body.

488
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:26,320
It is a violent act.
It's painful.

489
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:28,171
But it is love.

490
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,612
What would

491
00:23:29,662 --> 00:23:31,832
if we were living through
a moment like this?

492
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:34,135
No punishment,
purification.

493
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,961
Let me ask you... of its time.
Time is what we have.

494
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:40,077
These purifications
are in your covenant?

495
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,197
You say, occasionally,

496
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:45,068
no more betting,
e inundare the place?

497
00:23:45,118 --> 00:23:47,889
Sometimes, just for
a change, you're...

498
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:49,868
surrounded and
you'll be whipped,

499
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:51,310
you bring dogs,

500
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,409
and I cornered
in a field...

501
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:56,492
since you ask...

502
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,770
The first purification
was the flood.

503
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:00,423
The second was

504
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:03,106
the destruction of the temple
by Nebuchadnezzar.

505
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:05,881
We were taken
into exile in Babylon.

506
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:08,589
We were one nation
without a country.

507
00:24:08,624 --> 00:24:10,708
With no land,
went to the world,

508
00:24:10,743 --> 00:24:13,420
and take our
knowledge of the Torah

509
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:16,097
and only God Almighty,
into the open.

510
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:21,444
If we had stayed as
we would have achieved so much?

511
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:25,074
We would be a tribe
the desert, nothing more.

512
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:33,452
It was painful, but
also was wonderful

513
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,204
What if we were going
other catastrophic event?

514
00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:43,318
What if those who survive this
will be the holy remnant,

515
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:46,162
and live in an age of
wisdom, understanding and knowledge?

516
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:48,640
What if something good
would come out of this?

517
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,941
What great good?

518
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,495
How do we know?

519
00:24:52,545 --> 00:24:56,128
Already some say
that the Messiah himself.

520
00:24:57,318 --> 00:24:59,054
Perhaps a return to Israel.

521
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:00,306
So what?

522
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:02,910
So it might be
something beautiful.

523
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,464
So you see, maybe
There is a reason

524
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:07,711
Why a good woman
like your mother was taken,

525
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:10,336
and not some evil.

526
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,794
Because she is a sacrifice.

527
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:17,635
A holocaust.

528
00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:23,368
And when a man sacrifices
something must be better.

529
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:27,895
The most beautiful thing.

530
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,189
Can I call Idek?

531
00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:32,279
Can I interrogate him?

532
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:33,483
Can I call first to Idek?

533
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:34,637
The point is related.

534
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:46,085
Can you tell the court

535
00:25:46,991 --> 00:25:49,672
what happened to our
Masada ancestors?

536
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,900
Masada was... one
fortress in the mountains

537
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,061
built by
Herod the Great.

538
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,782
It was a kind of
self-shelter

539
00:26:00,817 --> 00:26:02,925
in case of war.

540
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,851
Of course, anyone can build
a wall against death.

541
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:08,067
Herod died,

542
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:10,188
and the Romans arrived,

543
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:11,522
destroyed the temple.

544
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:14,560
There was a great
uprising.

545
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,811
A revolt.

546
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:18,888
And the rebels ran
into the mountains,

547
00:26:18,923 --> 00:26:21,340
this Masada.

548
00:26:22,695 --> 00:26:24,790
The Romans besieged.

549
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:27,528
They wanted the rebels
starve.

550
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:30,181
So they built a huge wall
around the base of the mountain.

551
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:33,169
There, 15,000
Roman troops.

552
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:36,056
Less than a thousand
Jewish fighters.

553
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,244
That spring,
rebels

554
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:42,619
decided that
was better to die

555
00:26:42,654 --> 00:26:44,299
to be enslaved.

556
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:47,539
Ten men were chosen
for homework

557
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:49,709
to kill all others.

558
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,573
When you have 10 one was chosen
to kill the other nine.

559
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:56,721
The latter had to
take his own life.

560
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,875
Two women hid
of this slaughter

561
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,984
and lived to
tell this story.

562
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:05,419
These fighters do
kind of men were they?

563
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:06,836
The bravest
and better.

564
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:09,290
The... Israel flower.

565
00:27:10,143 --> 00:27:10,962
They were martyrs.

566
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:13,525
And yet, were
crushed by the Romans.

567
00:27:13,575 --> 00:27:17,207
Well, in a sense, yes,
But what did the Romans?

568
00:27:18,187 --> 00:27:22,257
Jews live like
Romans, and abandon the Torah.

569
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:23,989
And where are the
Romans now?

570
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:25,432
They are dust.

571
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:26,159
And the Torah?

572
00:27:26,593 --> 00:27:29,392
He still lives,
still... blooms.

573
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:30,979
Still illuminates the world.

574
00:27:31,405 --> 00:27:32,984
Thank you.

575
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:36,574
So we should not
despair.

576
00:27:38,743 --> 00:27:42,572
Our suffering is a privilege
if it is part of God's plan.

577
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:45,203
We are fortunate

578
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:48,167
purifying the people living
through our grief.

579
00:27:51,761 --> 00:27:54,127
Do not let
would take away their faith.

580
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:58,363
If this is strong,
grow.

581
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,308
A small fire is extinguished by
the wind, but a major fire

582
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:03,912
only grows stronger.

583
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,384
Hitler die.

584
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,966
The war will end.

585
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,642
The people and the Torah

586
00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:15,348
live.

587
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,295
Precisely.

588
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:18,666
There is, right?

589
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:19,918
If.

590
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:22,793
The Torah will live.

591
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:25,777
Therefore, we
trust God.

592
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:29,250
Can I question the witness?

593
00:28:29,514 --> 00:28:30,816
Not this.
The previous one.

594
00:28:30,866 --> 00:28:32,503
Ezra Zamkevitz.

595
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:35,128
Sorry, I'm
a witness.

596
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:38,407
know, do not testify
nothing of God.

597
00:28:39,102 --> 00:28:41,992
manufactures and sells gloves.

598
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:45,709
I used to make and
sell gloves.

599
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:49,283
Do you feel better at
that the judge has said,

600
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:53,378
your mother is
a sacrifice?

601
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:55,935
Yes, sir.

602
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,838
Although the judge
you have said

603
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:01,495
God demands sacrifice,

604
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:02,878
a sacrifice

605
00:29:02,928 --> 00:29:05,098
of the best Jews.

606
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:09,003
You want me to feel
better or worse?

607
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:12,128
We just want the truth.
Well, I know the truth.

608
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:16,591
I do not know why
such things happen. "

609
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,604
I used to make
and sell gloves.

610
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:23,639
Can I sit now,
please?

611
00:29:23,674 --> 00:29:25,636
I do not know how to respond
these questions.

612
00:29:25,671 --> 00:29:26,361
Thank you.

613
00:29:28,964 --> 00:29:31,346
So the suffering
is God's work,

614
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:33,074
is that true?

615
00:29:33,124 --> 00:29:34,767
In other words,

616
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:36,291
Mengele work for God.

617
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,943
Hitler is working for God.
Is that true?

618
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:43,718
It's unpleasant,
but it is possible.

619
00:29:43,863 --> 00:29:46,756
When Nebuchadnezzar invaded
Israel, and plundered the temple

620
00:29:46,806 --> 00:29:49,978
and led the people
into exile in Babylon,

621
00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:53,150
God called him
"My servant Nebuchadnezzar.

622
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:55,869
he was the scalpel and God

623
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,039
Surgeon.

624
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:00,342
We hate the scalpel,

625
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:02,377
but we love to surgeon.

626
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,063
If Hitler is

627
00:30:04,113 --> 00:30:06,283
doing God's work,

628
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:09,321
then logic says
stand in the way of Hitler

629
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:11,007
is lodged
God's way.

630
00:30:11,057 --> 00:30:14,423
Take up arms against
Hitler is wrong

631
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:17,790
Now, do you think someone
here in that?

632
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,251
Is there any way

633
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:21,533
that it can from
somehow be true?

634
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:24,489
Is not that... madness?

635
00:30:24,508 --> 00:30:26,628
Who you are heading?

636
00:30:26,678 --> 00:30:28,848
We must maintain
order here.

637
00:30:28,898 --> 00:30:31,018
We should try to
maintain order.

638
00:30:31,452 --> 00:30:33,919
I would call
our foreman.

639
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:36,659
Call me anything you want.

640
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:39,637
You can call it
he is not Jewish.

641
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,042
I would tell the court
what does all day.

642
00:30:48,687 --> 00:30:50,322
Do you know
what I do.

643
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:51,874
I take care of you.

644
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:53,782
They are like my babies.

645
00:30:54,057 --> 00:30:56,113
I am like a mother
for you.

646
00:30:56,504 --> 00:30:57,512
Why?

647
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,041
"Dinos

648
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,915
why you took a
job like this?

649
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,696
I got the chance.

650
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:09,666
They asked me because I speak German,
and because I have a brain.

651
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,937
And if any of you were sufficiently
smart, do the same.

652
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:18,618
I think you could
have said no.

653
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,358
I want to live... That is
I do this. Want to Live!

654
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:24,271
Not like you scum

655
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,925
already dead,
delivered as soon as they got here.

656
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:28,902
Not ashamed
what you do?

657
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:30,780
I have no answer for.

658
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,772
Or your court
or to your God.

659
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:39,305
I do not care
know God.

660
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:41,944
Because what I do,
let me tell you

661
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:43,849
what I do is nothing,

662
00:31:43,884 --> 00:31:46,681
nothing compared to what
the Sonderkommando ago!

663
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:48,771
Sent to other Jews
to the gas chambers.

664
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:50,812
The push within
and close the doors.

665
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:54,058
I removed the spoons
and sell them to other Jews.

666
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,147
They have cornered the entire
market spoons

667
00:31:57,197 --> 00:32:00,187
closing the doors
those of the same species.

668
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:01,385
I signals.

669
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:04,168
Do you think
survive this?

670
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:07,077
Maybe, maybe not.

671
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:15,897
And Professor Schmidt
says that when...

672
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:18,979
Look, let me tell you
about your God.

673
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,950
I leave here
alive, okay?

674
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,081
One day the war will end.

675
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:26,160
They might even lose.

676
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,923
In which case,
I will be out of here.

677
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:31,255
All I have to do is
stay alive until that day.

678
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:31,804
How?

679
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,165
What is it that
going to kill me?

680
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,110
They.

681
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:37,880
How do I stop them?

682
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,746
Pleased.

683
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:41,403
And how do I do that?

684
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:44,082
Keeping you
locked in order.

685
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,294
What is the worst thing
I can go?

686
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:50,898
To be left without
Jews who kill.

687
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:52,149
Then kill me.

688
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,848
When they are finished
to kill them.

689
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:57,445
When this transport
arrived today

690
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,783
that transport
these Poles.

691
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:00,807
You know what I did?

692
00:33:00,842 --> 00:33:03,159
Cheers.

693
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,528
That's what I did, and then
custom, said,

694
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:09,123
"Thank God. "

695
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:10,233
Wait!

696
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:11,243
listen!

697
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:13,938
Listen! Look!

698
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:25,613
Did I hit?

699
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,733
No.

700
00:33:27,783 --> 00:33:30,386
Do you know why?

701
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:34,705
Because I'm making
work the bastard.

702
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:36,895
Here I am God.

703
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:39,065
I am!

704
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:42,944
And your God,
your God of Abraham,

705
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,222
do not care
a damn!

706
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,706
Otherwise no
I have given them.

707
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,351
I'd like to make
another question.

708
00:33:53,385 --> 00:33:54,202
Got that?

709
00:33:54,252 --> 00:33:56,856
We can not
to some other witness?

710
00:33:56,906 --> 00:33:59,460
I'm not sure
this is helping.

711
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:05,485
Professor Schmidt
you said

712
00:34:05,535 --> 00:34:08,160
when the disaster ends
world could be better.

713
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:09,562
Perhaps
the Messiah comes.

714
00:34:09,597 --> 00:34:11,351
Perhaps return to Israel,

715
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:13,105
but who will survive this?

716
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,384
The foreman, the Sonderkommando
Who else?

717
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:19,012
The vicious
the crafty,

718
00:34:19,062 --> 00:34:21,591
the scoundrel,
ruthless...

719
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:24,075
What kind of Messiah

720
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:25,880
want these
as his people?

721
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,918
What kind of Israel will
built by such people?

722
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:33,508
"Build a nation of wisdom
and understanding and knowledge?

723
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,043
Not them, God.

724
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:37,891
How?

725
00:34:37,926 --> 00:34:40,438
We can not know.
He can do everything.

726
00:34:40,473 --> 00:34:41,683
'He can do everything. "

727
00:34:41,718 --> 00:34:43,974
Well, if you can do
However, why can not

728
00:34:44,156 --> 00:34:46,733
purify your people
without gassing?

729
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,533
He is almighty.

730
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,703
How can it be
powerful and just?

731
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,968
Or is all powerful,
in which case

732
00:34:58,003 --> 00:35:01,069
could have stopped this, but chose
not to because he is not just, o..

733
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:05,066
would have liked to
end to this, but could not.

734
00:35:05,224 --> 00:35:07,924
The answer is very simple.
They should know of the Yeshiva.

735
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,625
The answer is free will.
Yes, there is evil in the world

736
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,878
because God gave
man free will

737
00:35:11,928 --> 00:35:14,665
and opted to make the
evil is very simple.

738
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:15,625
Simple?

739
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,135
We are not puppets.

740
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:18,871
We choose.

741
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:22,941
We can always choose.

742
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:24,462
Free will?

743
00:35:24,512 --> 00:35:25,763
Free will, my ass.

744
00:35:25,813 --> 00:35:27,549
I will give you free will.

745
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,093
Where is Liebler?

746
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:30,537
Liebl, arise.

747
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,432
Wait for the
Judges call you

748
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:36,229
Ask Liebler for their children,
and then tell me about free will.

749
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,919
I call Liebl.

750
00:35:37,954 --> 00:35:39,695
You can not call anyone.

751
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:41,436
Judges
call witnesses.

752
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,039
I called Liebl.

753
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:47,944
Tell the court
your children.

754
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:49,730
I will not.

755
00:35:49,765 --> 00:35:51,558
If he tells them,
I'll tell him.

756
00:35:51,593 --> 00:35:54,107
The court did not
I asked to speak

757
00:35:54,142 --> 00:35:55,682
We have
order here.

758
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:57,491
When they arrived
to their village...

759
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,227
I'll tell you.

760
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:13,063
If you can tell,

761
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:15,636
then I who
should tell the tale.

762
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:19,189
I come from Hoengen.

763
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,357
Near Aachen.

764
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:25,439
And the Einsatzgruppen came.

765
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:27,406
When?

766
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:31,338
It seems like
hundred years ago.

767
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,680
They broke the doors
of the synagogue.

768
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,641
They burned the Torah
and the ark.

769
00:36:36,676 --> 00:36:38,656
And then we
cornered inside.

770
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,055
We thought we were
burn there and then...

771
00:36:45,225 --> 00:36:47,377
If only it
have done.

772
00:36:48,696 --> 00:36:50,849
Were carried
children.

773
00:36:52,684 --> 00:36:54,771
I have three children.

774
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,891
The greatest

775
00:36:56,941 --> 00:37:00,195
Will have seven now y...

776
00:37:00,245 --> 00:37:03,450
They're so beautiful.

777
00:37:03,884 --> 00:37:06,866
That does not...
never mind.

778
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:09,849
Placing children
in a truck.

779
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:12,771
I ran after
them and shouted,

780
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:16,435
"Please give me my children!
Give me my children. "

781
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,588
And this officer,
I listened.

782
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:22,110
She stopped and said:
"What are yours?"

783
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,870
I thought I would

784
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,581
to give it back.

785
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:28,568
I showed
my three children.

786
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:33,392
The eldest, was crying,
and the other two...

787
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:37,298
No, that's not all.

788
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:40,705
He said,

789
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:43,322
"Three cute guys.

790
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:46,410
"I tell you what you can do.

791
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,038
"Choose one.

792
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:51,567
"Pick one.

793
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:55,523
Choose one and you can
stay with him. "

794
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,717
And the boys,
listened.

795
00:37:57,767 --> 00:37:59,682
Spread
their hands.

796
00:37:59,732 --> 00:38:01,597
Were
so scared.

797
00:38:02,755 --> 00:38:04,225
They tried to get
to me and said,

798
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,673
"Please, my elíjeme.

799
00:38:08,107 --> 00:38:10,277
Elíjeme to me. "

800
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:16,302
This gentleman,

801
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:19,921
you always said
can choose.

802
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,546
Which should
choose?

803
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:25,884
The youngest?

804
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:27,584
At most?

805
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:30,376
The weakest?
The fittest?

806
00:38:33,275 --> 00:38:36,313
To Choose?

807
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,520
To which I should choose?

808
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:44,557
I can not say.

809
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:50,149
The court has heard
what is supposed

810
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:54,538
is to have free will, but...
Sorry, I do not want free will.

811
00:38:56,274 --> 00:38:58,329
I love my children.

812
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:00,998
Of course...

813
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,217
You talk about free will.

814
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:05,723
Where was then
my will?

815
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:09,911
What choice had?

816
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:13,412
That official,
could choose, not me.

817
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:16,979
Where was my
Free Will?

818
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:40,102
The war will end.

819
00:39:43,995 --> 00:39:45,743
Hitler die.

820
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:51,384
The people and the Torah
survive.

821
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,724
You say that the people
survive...

822
00:39:57,691 --> 00:39:58,848
...but tomorrow
morning

823
00:39:58,883 --> 00:40:02,024
half the people in this
room will be dead.

824
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:05,733
They do not share them
in his covenant?

825
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:09,610
His part is to witness,
keeping the flame alive

826
00:42:26,473 --> 00:42:30,519
Does anyone have something to say
in defense of God?

827
00:42:36,865 --> 00:42:39,550
Rabbi did not ask

828
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,185
it was... difficult.

829
00:42:42,235 --> 00:42:45,273
I asked him why
you said earlier

830
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:47,980
about what
beautiful it is.

831
00:42:48,744 --> 00:42:52,432
I would like the final
was beautiful

832
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:56,121
because my children
are beautiful...

833
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:58,637
...and tried to care for them.

834
00:42:58,672 --> 00:43:01,329
Of course it does.
God knows that if.

835
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:04,303
Have you heard anything?

836
00:43:04,338 --> 00:43:06,457
Are they here?

837
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:12,280
Two of them

838
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,649
are... twins,

839
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:19,120
and I understand that...

840
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,157
likes to Mengele
twins.

841
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:25,822
They are treated better

842
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:28,152
because it has
interest in them.

843
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:30,787
A Mengele interested
and God no.. Stop.

844
00:43:30,837 --> 00:43:33,366
She is in heaven and can not
see beyond the clouds.

845
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:33,874
Job, chapter 22.

846
00:43:33,924 --> 00:43:35,125
What?

847
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:36,911
Your argument that
God is indifferent

848
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:38,648
is not unprecedented
as it happens.

849
00:43:38,698 --> 00:43:39,949
It is written in Job.

850
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:42,517
Good.

851
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:44,546
You say also

852
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:47,518
God should be here in the
gas chambers, not us?

853
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,939
They can detain you to put
these thoughts in my head.

854
00:43:50,974 --> 00:43:52,918
There is a possibility

855
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:57,306
that this confusion is the precursor
of some great event,

856
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:02,003
the fire that burns us
is a refining fire...

857
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:04,661
...to create
a golden age.

858
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:08,995
If your children were taken by it,
were taken as martyrs.

859
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,998
To be a martyr, a man
should choose martyrdom.

860
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:15,785
We are not being martyred
by our faith, but because of our race,

861
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,004
not by the Torah, but
by our ancestors.

862
00:44:19,054 --> 00:44:22,909
But He's here.

863
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,453
Who?

864
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:25,897
God.

865
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:31,514
I know he's here
although he does not understand.

866
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:33,708
Some days

867
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:37,179
in spring,
fell... snow

868
00:44:37,229 --> 00:44:40,542
and the first rays
heat of the sun

869
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,820
since...
who knows.

870
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,775
Do you think the guard did not feel
the sun on your back?

871
00:44:46,825 --> 00:44:50,681
The sun on your back, yes,
but that's not what I felt.

872
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:53,234
I felt Him

873
00:44:53,284 --> 00:44:54,153
The guard did not

874
00:44:54,203 --> 00:44:55,838
felt that.

875
00:44:55,888 --> 00:44:58,963
That heat is not
enters his uniform.

876
00:44:58,998 --> 00:45:00,611
I would change with him.

877
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:04,137
But maybe what you said about God
suffering in the gas chamber.

878
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:06,644
Maybe that's what
is happening here.

879
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:09,436
Perhaps he is suffering
us.

880
00:45:09,471 --> 00:45:11,511
Who needs a God
suffering?

881
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,880
We need a God to send the
angel of death to our enemies.

882
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:19,321
Where... is?

883
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:24,529
I do not know much about God.

884
00:45:25,846 --> 00:45:29,302
Maybe God never changes.
Perhaps if.

885
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,616
Perhaps it is not almighty.

886
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:35,811
Maybe we need
to be complete.

887
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:37,938
Maybe that's why we did.

888
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:40,015
Well, it's hard to see how

889
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:43,325
could be of some use
in our present condition.

890
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,037
Yes, but even so...

891
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:49,697
...in the city
of Baranowicz,

892
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:53,602
We killed a
Purim, and the rabbi shouted,

893
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:58,375
"Do not forget it
this day means!

894
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:00,112
L'Chaim! "

895
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:06,186
And singing, while
shoot him.

896
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,875
But your...
you keep asking,

897
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:12,696
"Whence comes
all this evil? "

898
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:17,465
But where does
all this goodness?

899
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:23,862
And you thought that while
he took your children?

900
00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:26,133
Even the foreman
I think.

901
00:46:26,168 --> 00:46:29,974
He thinks the war will end
and the Nazis lost.

902
00:46:30,009 --> 00:46:32,507
Even he thinks
good win.

903
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:35,462
What do I know?

904
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:42,090
I do not know what he
can do and not do.

905
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:46,394
"I've ever given orders

906
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,883
morning... "

907
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:52,463
...or sent to his post
dawn?

908
00:46:53,653 --> 00:46:56,523
"Have I ever walked
at the bottom of the abyss?

909
00:46:56,573 --> 00:46:59,995
"What is the way
home of the light? "

910
00:47:00,429 --> 00:47:03,033
"What gives light
frost... "

911
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:06,454
Here you are sir,

912
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:08,876
just as I suspected.
Yes, silence.

913
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,579
How many are you?

914
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:16,484
Twelve.

915
00:47:18,654 --> 00:47:21,152
This is a place
very well directed.

916
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:23,861
Yes, there were complications
this morning

917
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:26,415
caused by the rapid
arrival of transport,

918
00:47:26,465 --> 00:47:30,805
which makes his induction
is not yet complete.

919
00:47:30,855 --> 00:47:34,301
My apologies
for the inconvenience.

920
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:37,748
Auschwitz is not
a nursing home.

921
00:47:37,798 --> 00:47:40,785
You work or you die.

922
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:43,389
The choice is yours.

923
00:47:49,898 --> 00:47:51,634
Come on. Up! Arise!

924
00:47:51,684 --> 00:47:53,611
Come on.
Arise!

925
00:47:53,661 --> 00:47:55,539
Stand up. Arise!

926
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,819
Remove it.

927
00:48:11,854 --> 00:48:14,366
I have to use
for health reasons

928
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:16,368
Just remove it.

929
00:48:17,236 --> 00:48:19,481
This is the dentist.

930
00:48:19,516 --> 00:48:22,318
Come see early
in the morning.

931
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,289
Excuse me, Rabbi.

932
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:23,629
Can I?

933
00:49:25,237 --> 00:49:27,904
I think the trial

934
00:49:27,954 --> 00:49:30,572
I listen to an end.

935
00:49:30,622 --> 00:49:32,741
Please.

936
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:34,427
No.

937
00:49:34,477 --> 00:49:36,163
It's important.

938
00:49:36,213 --> 00:49:39,251
For me is important.

939
00:49:42,288 --> 00:49:44,733
You started the trial.

940
00:49:44,768 --> 00:49:46,672
should complete it.

941
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:49,421
Should continue
the procedure

942
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:51,401
and cite precedents and.

943
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:54,388
be men.

944
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:57,910
They think that we are not
men, but if you are.

945
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:02,683
We removed
that from us.

946
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:07,758
Yes, true, but I have
reached a natural conclusion,

947
00:50:07,793 --> 00:50:10,010
and may be a case of...
He gave us the law,

948
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,313
and debate the law, even
in such a terrible topic

949
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:16,520
is a kind
prayer... No

950
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:20,909
No, no, listen
discuss this...

951
00:50:21,777 --> 00:50:25,198
...comforted us.

952
00:50:25,248 --> 00:50:29,588
I felt I was listening,
who was with us.

953
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,311
If.

954
00:50:34,361 --> 00:50:35,639
Well...

955
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:41,738
in brief...

956
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,209
we know that...

957
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:50,416
we can not know
the mind of God

958
00:50:50,466 --> 00:50:52,586
God is too great.

959
00:50:53,888 --> 00:50:58,227
And all we can
do is pray,

960
00:50:58,277 --> 00:51:00,397
have faith.

961
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:06,423
Hitler die.

962
00:51:06,473 --> 00:51:08,883
The war will end...

963
00:51:08,918 --> 00:51:09,944
No, no, no,

964
00:51:11,246 --> 00:51:13,365
That's not going to be.

965
00:51:13,415 --> 00:51:18,338
Ask us to accept predictions
as evidence.. no, no, no

966
00:51:18,373 --> 00:51:21,376
The argument returns
to its beginning.

967
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,419
If you take it to a vote now,
I vote guilty.

968
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:26,357
It is certainly true of

969
00:51:26,392 --> 00:51:28,554
we can not understand
the mind of God.

970
00:51:28,604 --> 00:51:32,489
His ways are not our own...
It touches us understand the mind of God.

971
00:51:32,524 --> 00:51:36,737
...and therefore...
We are not concerned his mind.
... we must respect.

972
00:51:36,772 --> 00:51:38,150
It is his covenant.

973
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,753
We have
to understand that.

974
00:51:40,803 --> 00:51:42,439
All this writing.

975
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:45,043
We just have
to determine

976
00:51:45,093 --> 00:51:47,990
if broken
their conditions or not.

977
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:50,308
Where is...
Where is the scholar?

978
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:53,548
Where is the scholar?

979
00:51:58,111 --> 00:52:01,038
Psalm return
the psalm.

980
00:52:01,073 --> 00:52:02,412
Tell us the psalm.

981
00:52:02,462 --> 00:52:03,878
Everything? Is,

982
00:52:03,928 --> 00:52:05,295
is very long.

983
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,702
We were getting somewhere when
spoke on Psalm

984
00:52:12,536 --> 00:52:15,189
I forget.
Psalm which was?

985
00:52:15,224 --> 00:52:17,650
81.

986
00:52:23,713 --> 00:52:27,619
David's throne will last
for all time

987
00:52:27,669 --> 00:52:29,789
and their descendants...

988
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:37,983
The...

989
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:41,071
The throne of David
shall at all times,

990
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:43,674
and their descendants...

991
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,429
It has begun

992
00:53:07,262 --> 00:53:09,661
Beginning in
block 7.

993
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:13,183
I took a couple
of hours to get here.

994
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:18,390
I still have time
to smoke a cigarette,

995
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,458
sleep with a
few women,

996
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:24,031
write a sonnet.

997
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:29,188
Schmidt

998
00:53:29,238 --> 00:53:31,842
continues to say that
people survive.

999
00:53:31,892 --> 00:53:33,929
That's what it says
in the pact.

1000
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:38,785
God guarantees the survival
the Jewish people.

1001
00:53:38,835 --> 00:53:41,822
I say that God is guilty

1002
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,728
because survival
the people

1003
00:53:45,778 --> 00:53:48,325
It is not safe.

1004
00:53:51,578 --> 00:53:56,142
No, not you.. How can
our people cease to exist?

1005
00:53:56,192 --> 00:53:58,667
Oh, believe me,
that's the plan.

1006
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,615
Destroy us.

1007
00:54:01,123 --> 00:54:02,785
That's ridiculous.

1008
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,639
When I came here,

1009
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:08,727
He had lived all my
Zamkevitz life.

1010
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:13,884
When I walked through these doors,

1011
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:16,971
that was the largest number of people
I had seen in my life.

1012
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:21,391
I saw more people in an hour
that in all my life.

1013
00:54:22,174 --> 00:54:23,759
I thought,

1014
00:54:25,217 --> 00:54:27,921
How is it possible that
many people are alive?

1015
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:30,103
But now...

1016
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,581
...How is it possible that
many may die?

1017
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:39,022
Please surely know
that the numbers are not important.

1018
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:42,140
When a child dies
tuberculosis,

1019
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:45,128
this is terrible.

1020
00:54:45,178 --> 00:54:48,879
"It's worse if a million die?

1021
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:52,555
When a child dies,

1022
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:55,979
Can you believe that
happens for a purpose,

1023
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:58,580
or do not pass the test.

1024
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,185
We can not know
the mind of God.

1025
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,970
We are not talking
of his mind.

1026
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,573
We are talking
covenant,

1027
00:55:06,007 --> 00:55:08,601
a deal that promises
we will survive.

1028
00:55:08,636 --> 00:55:12,706
Survive as a people
and not be annihilated.

1029
00:55:12,741 --> 00:55:15,903
But there are Jews all over
the world, not only in Europe

1030
00:55:15,988 --> 00:55:17,289
My brother
has a friend

1031
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:18,541
in Woudge - he told me...

1032
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:20,543
Do you think if
they kill us here

1033
00:55:20,593 --> 00:55:22,496
Left alone to
friend of your brother?

1034
00:55:22,546 --> 00:55:24,232
We may be the last.

1035
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:28,974
Maybe our
end is near.

1036
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:33,498
We consider
that we in this room,

1037
00:55:33,533 --> 00:55:34,711
we are the holy remnant.

1038
00:55:34,746 --> 00:55:37,120
It is therefore important
what we decide.

1039
00:55:38,092 --> 00:55:40,672
If you're the last,

1040
00:55:40,722 --> 00:55:43,117
We can finish the story.

1041
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:45,512
We can finish it here,

1042
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:47,665
the story that started
with Moses at Sinai

1043
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:50,907
3,500 years ago.

1044
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,083
We can finish it,
we can break the covenant.

1045
00:55:55,537 --> 00:55:56,398
So I think

1046
00:55:56,433 --> 00:55:59,302
that when they come
you, they'll say,

1047
00:55:59,337 --> 00:56:01,067
"Oh, no
we are Jews.

1048
00:56:01,117 --> 00:56:02,660
Open the doors.
We're going home? "

1049
00:56:02,695 --> 00:56:05,841
We're still Jews,
will always be Jews.

1050
00:56:05,891 --> 00:56:08,928
Nothing changes for us, because
we are not defendants here.

1051
00:56:08,978 --> 00:56:11,532
It is God who is being
defendant, not us.

1052
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:12,833
Aah! Taisez-vous, imbeciles!

1053
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:14,569
He says to shut up.

1054
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:16,478
I understand.

1055
00:56:16,528 --> 00:56:18,337
vou et les nazis

1056
00:56:18,372 --> 00:56:19,852
sont tous pareils.

1057
00:56:21,552 --> 00:56:23,267
Says we're like...

1058
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:24,983
no, we belong to a...

1059
00:56:28,153 --> 00:56:28,889
have something in common

1060
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:30,191
with the Nazis.

1061
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:33,241
I am translating.

1062
00:56:33,276 --> 00:56:34,047
Maybe wrong.

1063
00:56:34,097 --> 00:56:36,216
Scream all you want.

1064
00:56:36,266 --> 00:56:39,835
Kill me if you want, just
I will die in the morning.

1065
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:51,976
How many stars do you
there in the universe,

1066
00:56:52,756 --> 00:56:56,692
Excuse me, but before...

1067
00:56:57,095 --> 00:56:59,215
...before he dies,

1068
00:56:59,265 --> 00:57:01,869
I was physically in Paris.

1069
00:57:04,038 --> 00:57:06,980
A hundred thousand
millions of stars

1070
00:57:07,015 --> 00:57:08,327
in our galaxy.

1071
00:57:08,377 --> 00:57:10,113
Only in our galaxy.

1072
00:57:32,523 --> 00:57:35,066
"God made all
those stars?

1073
00:57:35,101 --> 00:57:37,730
Very likely. The prophet
Amos tells us... Why?

1074
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,983
Pardon?

1075
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:42,498
He created one hundred thousand
millions of stars

1076
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,623
in our own galaxy.

1077
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:47,711
How many of them have
planets, we know.

1078
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:51,760
And yet, his whole attention
is focused on a small planet

1079
00:57:51,795 --> 00:57:54,400
just the outer edge
of a spiral.

1080
00:57:54,435 --> 00:57:58,471
And even with
whole planet, no.

1081
00:57:58,506 --> 00:58:01,285
Only the Jews.

1082
00:58:02,393 --> 00:58:03,716
This man,

1083
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:07,416
I believe one hundred thousand
million stars,

1084
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:10,276
signed a contract
with Jews.

1085
00:58:10,326 --> 00:58:11,962
Only Jews.

1086
00:58:12,012 --> 00:58:15,469
And even with all
Jews, no, no..

1087
00:58:15,504 --> 00:58:17,754
because Jews
I do not count.

1088
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,426
So tell me this.

1089
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:26,618
If so loved the Jews,

1090
00:58:26,668 --> 00:58:29,319
Why do
Anything else?

1091
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:32,065
Why not filled the universe

1092
00:58:32,115 --> 00:58:34,762
with Jews instead of stars?

1093
00:58:35,444 --> 00:58:37,130
What is the point?

1094
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,973
We do not know the point.

1095
00:58:39,008 --> 00:58:41,035
It seems incredible, too,

1096
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:44,551
that throughout the universe,
should choose us.

1097
00:58:44,586 --> 00:58:46,292
It is not surprising.

1098
00:58:46,342 --> 00:58:49,177
It's crazy.

1099
00:58:49,256 --> 00:58:51,500
It is simply
wrong.

1100
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,186
Newborns think

1101
00:58:53,236 --> 00:58:55,172
that are the focus
the universe.

1102
00:58:55,207 --> 00:58:58,184
They think they do
sucking milk believe

1103
00:58:58,219 --> 00:59:00,331
that the world fades
when they close their eyes.

1104
00:59:00,366 --> 00:59:01,865
They are wrong.

1105
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:05,933
In the Middle Ages, men viewed
that the sun orbited the earth.

1106
00:59:05,968 --> 00:59:07,506
They were wrong.

1107
00:59:07,556 --> 00:59:09,241
It is an illusion caused

1108
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:12,149
to the point where you are
at that time.

1109
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:17,970
And it's the same with God.

1110
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:20,574
The same.

1111
00:59:22,744 --> 00:59:24,914
So, think.

1112
00:59:25,781 --> 00:59:27,467
Please think.

1113
00:59:27,517 --> 00:59:31,547
In the past, a nation
could have 50 gods,

1114
00:59:31,582 --> 00:59:34,546
one to grow corn;
one for the river to rise.. I do not know

1115
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:37,932
Men make their societies
the image of their gods.

1116
00:59:37,982 --> 00:59:39,618
Therefore, companies
many gods

1117
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:42,271
have many leaders,
different centers of power.

1118
00:59:43,117 --> 00:59:46,610
welcome you to strangers
and to new ideas.

1119
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,648
As the Egyptians.

1120
00:59:51,817 --> 00:59:53,770
Then next to them

1121
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,723
came the Jews...

1122
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,656
...with his great idea.

1123
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,616
A great idea.

1124
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:05,270
There is only one God.

1125
01:00:06,972 --> 01:00:07,860
Amazing.

1126
01:00:07,953 --> 01:00:09,125
And what happens?

1127
01:00:09,175 --> 01:00:10,911
create a society
where,

1128
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:13,106
all powers
are concentrated

1129
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:15,251
in the hands of a
man, a king.

1130
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:18,027
An effective partnership.

1131
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,052
An efficient ship.

1132
01:00:21,476 --> 01:00:25,231
And he has this idea that
God loves them more than anyone.

1133
01:00:25,762 --> 01:00:26,916
Thrive.

1134
01:00:26,966 --> 01:00:28,702
They maintain that God
for themselves.

1135
01:00:28,752 --> 01:00:31,995
They try to isolate themselves.

1136
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,777
But then someone comes
even better idea -

1137
01:00:36,317 --> 01:00:37,408
Christians.

1138
01:00:37,443 --> 01:00:41,464
They say, yes,
there is only one God,

1139
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,464
But not only
He loves the Jews.

1140
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:45,576
Love all.

1141
01:00:45,626 --> 01:00:47,911
We must conquer
all...

1142
01:00:48,421 --> 01:00:50,105
The Romans
They loved it.

1143
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:53,056
Developed.

1144
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:54,305
They conquered all.

1145
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:56,996
A god.

1146
01:00:57,046 --> 01:00:58,594
A king.

1147
01:00:58,644 --> 01:01:00,330
This is how it is.

1148
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,549
It is the
power and control,

1149
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:04,285
and what

1150
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:07,962
lost.

1151
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:11,228
But midway
the Romans are gone... Because

1152
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,495
Because someone
had a better idea.

1153
01:01:14,952 --> 01:01:16,004
Hitler...

1154
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:17,738
had the idea,

1155
01:01:18,172 --> 01:01:20,342
there is one God, and that's me.

1156
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:26,199
Here,
Hitler is God not?

1157
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:29,454
But still
we're here.

1158
01:01:32,926 --> 01:01:35,246
We are still
here tonight.

1159
01:01:49,884 --> 01:01:52,535
You deny God.

1160
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:54,622
What has given you?

1161
01:01:57,264 --> 01:01:58,044
What?

1162
01:01:58,094 --> 01:01:59,829
There are many here

1163
01:01:59,879 --> 01:02:01,515
who have denied God.

1164
01:02:01,565 --> 01:02:04,153
They became, taken by
wife a goya,

1165
01:02:04,169 --> 01:02:05,470
turned their backs
to the Scriptures...

1166
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,025
Sorry. Is
talking about me.

1167
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:09,810
We're here to point
die, and what

1168
01:02:10,244 --> 01:02:12,941
you dislike the most
is the fact that I married.

1169
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:15,017
But where did he give?

1170
01:02:17,289 --> 01:02:20,224
Where you feel you are
different from me now?

1171
01:02:20,274 --> 01:02:21,527
What you got?

1172
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,828
Please.

1173
01:02:23,263 --> 01:02:25,153
Please point out one point.

1174
01:02:25,188 --> 01:02:28,215
These kids educated
Like my son,

1175
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,337
like this man

1176
01:02:29,771 --> 01:02:32,809
said they saw a truth
that we did not see.

1177
01:02:33,242 --> 01:02:36,013
But here they are,

1178
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:38,451
all equal

1179
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:43,223
Facing death.

1180
01:02:46,313 --> 01:02:47,563
Look at Ricard.

1181
01:02:47,613 --> 01:02:49,299
Outside

1182
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:51,419
was a rich man.

1183
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:53,204
He had many friends.
But here,

1184
01:02:53,254 --> 01:02:54,456
is scared.

1185
01:02:54,506 --> 01:02:56,242
He can not believe
he will die.

1186
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:58,796
Because I will not die.

1187
01:02:58,846 --> 01:03:01,331
Your going to die,
pious idiot.

1188
01:03:01,366 --> 01:03:02,926
He has been selected.

1189
01:03:02,976 --> 01:03:04,437
I've been selected!

1190
01:03:04,487 --> 01:03:07,090
You were sent to the
left like me,

1191
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,260
and now you're scared.

1192
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:12,303
The cheats and steals

1193
01:03:12,338 --> 01:03:13,115
because he thinks

1194
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,744
have more bread than the rest
of us will make you happy.

1195
01:03:15,779 --> 01:03:18,823
And think the pray
going to save your life.

1196
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:23,145
4000 years using dumb
hats and still

1197
01:03:23,195 --> 01:03:26,021
continue its course
to death!

1198
01:03:26,725 --> 01:03:28,787
There is a wasp.

1199
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:32,127
It is called
Ichneumonidae.

1200
01:03:32,259 --> 01:03:34,211
The eggs are laid

1201
01:03:34,261 --> 01:03:36,163
in the Caterpillars.

1202
01:03:36,598 --> 01:03:38,333
The eggs hatch

1203
01:03:39,522 --> 01:03:41,185
and then the larvae
wasp

1204
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:42,881
eat the caterpillar
from within.

1205
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:45,227
Eat out
offline.

1206
01:03:45,277 --> 01:03:49,182
What kind of God
would design something?

1207
01:03:51,214 --> 01:03:53,018
And yet...

1208
01:03:53,068 --> 01:03:54,823
Sorry.

1209
01:03:55,691 --> 01:03:59,597
Y... my grandfather
planted figs.

1210
01:03:59,647 --> 01:04:01,463
There is a wasp...

1211
01:04:01,513 --> 01:04:03,280
I'm sure you know.

1212
01:04:03,315 --> 01:04:06,517
And this wasp lays
eggs on the flower.

1213
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:09,720
And when the young wasps
are ready to fly,

1214
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,537
collect pollen.

1215
01:04:12,572 --> 01:04:14,884
Not accumulate against the

1216
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:17,614
as another wasp
or a bee or wind.

1217
01:04:17,649 --> 01:04:18,206
They stop

1218
01:04:18,256 --> 01:04:19,124
and collect pollen.

1219
01:04:19,558 --> 01:04:20,376
You can see them.

1220
01:04:20,426 --> 01:04:22,596
And then carry
pollen

1221
01:04:22,646 --> 01:04:24,633
the other trees.

1222
01:04:24,683 --> 01:04:26,621
This did not help.

1223
01:04:26,656 --> 01:04:28,670
They can not eat.

1224
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,659
They do..

1225
01:04:31,709 --> 01:04:33,877
It is a beautiful arrangement.

1226
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:36,481
Surely God...

1227
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:38,601
Say,

1228
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:40,771
this wasp.

1229
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:43,424
Does this for
all figs

1230
01:04:43,474 --> 01:04:46,028
or only for the Jews?

1231
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:50,428
They laugh at me...

1232
01:04:50,478 --> 01:04:51,792
I laugh at you.

1233
01:04:51,827 --> 01:04:54,273
Just do
observe things

1234
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,339
not like babies,

1235
01:04:56,702 --> 01:04:58,820
but as men

1236
01:04:59,914 --> 01:05:02,084
Men of reason.

1237
01:05:03,386 --> 01:05:06,373
Use your right.

1238
01:05:06,423 --> 01:05:09,027
We speak
of reason.

1239
01:05:09,461 --> 01:05:12,065
What is the reason?

1240
01:05:12,499 --> 01:05:16,837
When caught you at your university in Paris,
where you looked as not Jewish,

1241
01:05:16,887 --> 01:05:19,568
spoke as a Jew,
thought as a Jew,

1242
01:05:19,603 --> 01:05:21,003
and you put
here with us,

1243
01:05:21,038 --> 01:05:23,347
that part played
reason in this?

1244
01:05:23,781 --> 01:05:26,768
What is the use
of reason

1245
01:05:26,818 --> 01:05:28,988
in a world governed
by madness?

1246
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:32,410
The decision

1247
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,280
be voted
of judges.

1248
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:38,051
Sorry, judges
court,

1249
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:41,059
You were wrong
about my children?

1250
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:44,610
Is there anything
hope after all?

1251
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,345
Nothing.

1252
01:05:46,779 --> 01:05:48,515
Get used to this.

1253
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:06,307
Nothing.

1254
01:06:07,174 --> 01:06:09,344
The judges granted.

1255
01:06:18,763 --> 01:06:20,736
I'm not Jewish.

1256
01:06:23,664 --> 01:06:25,834
I never knew
my father.

1257
01:06:26,702 --> 01:06:29,689
I did not know he was Jewish.

1258
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:31,909
He died when I
was still a baby. "

1259
01:06:33,645 --> 01:06:35,598
My mother was a...

1260
01:06:35,648 --> 01:06:37,551
a good German.

1261
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,758
He returned home and resumed
her maiden name.

1262
01:06:44,493 --> 01:06:47,017
They thought that every
had been forgotten.

1263
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:50,569
At school I was
a good boy.

1264
01:06:51,003 --> 01:06:53,341
I became
a good father.

1265
01:06:54,908 --> 01:06:58,019
My children joined
the Hitler Youth.

1266
01:07:00,324 --> 01:07:03,857
It was a year ago
The Gestapo came for me.

1267
01:07:03,907 --> 01:07:07,391
That was the first
I heard from my race.

1268
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,208
I thought it was a
normal German.

1269
01:07:13,049 --> 01:07:15,176
I was German.

1270
01:07:15,212 --> 01:07:19,204
A German
hated Jews.

1271
01:07:20,076 --> 01:07:22,743
He knew nothing about
their customs.

1272
01:07:22,778 --> 01:07:24,601
The learned here.

1273
01:07:24,636 --> 01:07:28,299
I have never heard a word
of the Torah before coming here.

1274
01:07:29,623 --> 01:07:30,875
But I am not alone.

1275
01:07:30,925 --> 01:07:33,095
They must understand that...

1276
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:38,518
...I grew up learning
that Jews were

1277
01:07:38,568 --> 01:07:41,773
dirty, misleading
and disorganized.

1278
01:07:43,076 --> 01:07:48,283
And when I got here, I saw that
everything you thought was true

1279
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:51,562
This place was chaotic,

1280
01:07:51,612 --> 01:07:54,741
dirty and disorganized;

1281
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:57,808
I thought I was
because of the Jews.

1282
01:07:57,843 --> 01:08:00,657
How could this be another
dirty thing?

1283
01:08:00,707 --> 01:08:03,471
There is only one latrine
for 5,000 people

1284
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:07,011
That's why.

1285
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:09,545
Think
is a mistake?

1286
01:08:09,595 --> 01:08:11,282
Do you think

1287
01:08:11,715 --> 01:08:13,401
German engineer

1288
01:08:13,451 --> 01:08:15,621
not put
adequate plumbing

1289
01:08:15,671 --> 01:08:17,790
by mistake?

1290
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,910
No.

1291
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:25,167
This is not how it was.
Nothing here is accidental.

1292
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:28,639
The soil is
part of the system,

1293
01:08:29,073 --> 01:08:30,759
like...

1294
01:08:30,809 --> 01:08:34,280
the fence, spotlights y...

1295
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:37,318
the other equipment.

1296
01:08:39,054 --> 01:08:41,173
It serves a function.

1297
01:08:41,223 --> 01:08:44,196
This is where they
take away their dignity,

1298
01:08:44,231 --> 01:08:45,764
their humanity.

1299
01:08:45,814 --> 01:08:47,424
Our dignity.

1300
01:08:47,474 --> 01:08:48,984
Our humanity.

1301
01:08:49,034 --> 01:08:51,204
It is part of the process.

1302
01:08:53,374 --> 01:08:55,493
So they can...

1303
01:08:55,543 --> 01:08:58,146
Germans get
Common kill us,

1304
01:08:58,196 --> 01:08:59,882
should show

1305
01:09:00,316 --> 01:09:04,608
that we are what ordinary Germans to
are taught to think we are...

1306
01:09:04,893 --> 01:09:05,958
dirty,

1307
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,967
and without a God-fearing.

1308
01:09:12,033 --> 01:09:14,203
When they arrived here,

1309
01:09:14,253 --> 01:09:16,180
took away their property;

1310
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:18,108
people took their names;

1311
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:20,227
cut their hair;

1312
01:09:20,277 --> 01:09:23,315
took their children...

1313
01:09:23,365 --> 01:09:26,303
wives, mothers...

1314
01:09:26,353 --> 01:09:29,547
even filling in their teeth.

1315
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,077
All

1316
01:09:31,127 --> 01:09:34,017
which were removed
made them to be men

1317
01:09:35,465 --> 01:09:38,503
Do not let you remove
your God, too.

1318
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:42,359
No matter how...

1319
01:09:42,409 --> 01:09:45,880
how stupid and useless
may seem,

1320
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:48,918
the pact is his.

1321
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:52,632
God is his God.

1322
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,502
Even though there is.

1323
01:09:58,895 --> 01:09:59,766
Keep it.

1324
01:10:01,068 --> 01:10:05,605
Leave something that
not be removed.

1325
01:10:07,143 --> 01:10:09,313
Us.

1326
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,466
Judges are
three in number

1327
01:10:15,516 --> 01:10:18,032
to always
have a decision.

1328
01:10:18,067 --> 01:10:20,595
To be unanimous

1329
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:23,397
or has a majority

1330
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:24,844
for a
point of view.

1331
01:10:25,368 --> 01:10:27,105
The accusation is

1332
01:10:27,538 --> 01:10:31,017
God has broken his covenant
with the Jewish people.

1333
01:10:31,052 --> 01:10:31,878
Who brought us out

1334
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:33,563
Egypt?

1335
01:10:33,613 --> 01:10:35,349
Finally some
common sense.

1336
01:10:38,386 --> 01:10:40,123
God brought us out of Egypt.

1337
01:10:40,556 --> 01:10:42,292
Another question.

1338
01:10:42,342 --> 01:10:44,412
Why

1339
01:10:44,462 --> 01:10:46,582
at first
were in Egypt?

1340
01:10:46,632 --> 01:10:50,888
There was a famine, and by
Therefore we take refuge.

1341
01:10:50,923 --> 01:10:51,839
Who sent the famine?

1342
01:10:52,273 --> 01:10:54,443
Well, hunger,
not know much about...

1343
01:10:54,493 --> 01:10:55,694
God sent famine.

1344
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:58,533
So God
sent to Egypt

1345
01:10:58,568 --> 01:11:00,556
and God
out of Egypt.

1346
01:11:00,591 --> 01:11:02,081
Exactly.

1347
01:11:02,254 --> 01:11:06,091
And then we got
Babylon,

1348
01:11:06,121 --> 01:11:08,699
in order to..
And when we out of Egypt

1349
01:11:08,734 --> 01:11:09,146
how did?

1350
01:11:09,196 --> 01:11:10,932
With words? Visions?

1351
01:11:11,366 --> 01:11:12,184
A miracle?

1352
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,838
Moses asked the Pharaoh...

1353
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:16,573
And when Pharaoh said no?

1354
01:11:16,623 --> 01:11:17,825
Pests.

1355
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:22,649
Moses became the first
Egyptian water into blood,

1356
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:25,252
then God sent
the plague of frogs,

1357
01:11:25,686 --> 01:11:27,806
then the plague
mosquitoes,

1358
01:11:27,856 --> 01:11:30,893
then, a plague of
flies, then killed

1359
01:11:30,943 --> 01:11:32,579
their livestock,

1360
01:11:32,629 --> 01:11:34,799
then the plague
the rash

1361
01:11:34,849 --> 01:11:36,100
then hail,

1362
01:11:36,534 --> 01:11:37,786
crops that abused

1363
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:41,595
and even the trees
and structures everywhere

1364
01:11:41,645 --> 01:11:45,354
except in Goshen,
where the Israelites lived.

1365
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:47,374
And yet Pharaoh
disagreed.

1366
01:11:47,409 --> 01:11:48,635
And so the plague
locusts

1367
01:11:48,685 --> 01:11:52,591
and then the days of darkness
and, finally, what?

1368
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:56,229
God killed the
firstborn of Egypt

1369
01:11:56,264 --> 01:11:57,887
and us out of Egypt.

1370
01:11:57,922 --> 01:12:00,351
He killed the firstborn,

1371
01:12:00,401 --> 01:12:04,256
from the firstborn
and heir of Pharaoh

1372
01:12:04,306 --> 01:12:08,615
the firstborn from the
slaves in the mills.

1373
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:11,431
Murdered them all.

1374
01:12:12,986 --> 01:12:15,278
God killed Pharaoh?

1375
01:12:15,313 --> 01:12:18,143
No, I think
because then...

1376
01:12:18,193 --> 01:12:22,225
He was the Pharaoh who said no,
but God let him live

1377
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,246
and killed their children
instead.

1378
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:28,267
All children.

1379
01:12:29,475 --> 01:12:32,078
And then the
people of Israel

1380
01:12:32,128 --> 01:12:33,331
could leave,

1381
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:35,500
taking with them
gold and silver

1382
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:39,022
and jewelry and clothing
dress of the Egyptians.

1383
01:12:39,072 --> 01:12:43,124
And then God drowned
soldiers

1384
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:44,676
who pursued them.

1385
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:48,135
It closed the waters to the
soldiers could not follow.

1386
01:12:48,185 --> 01:12:49,870
He waited until
were following

1387
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,908
and then
closed waters.

1388
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:55,102
And then what?

1389
01:12:55,152 --> 01:12:57,197
Then the desert

1390
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:58,889
Finally, the
promised land...

1391
01:12:58,924 --> 01:13:00,098
Now, the Promised Land

1392
01:13:00,133 --> 01:13:01,536
was.. is empty?

1393
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:02,889
A new place,
fallow?

1394
01:13:03,323 --> 01:13:04,140
No. There was...

1395
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:07,227
As written,
"When the Lord your God

1396
01:13:07,277 --> 01:13:08,913
"I take you to land,

1397
01:13:08,963 --> 01:13:11,650
"sacrificed many
nations before you,

1398
01:13:11,685 --> 01:13:14,281
"much bigger countries

1399
01:13:14,316 --> 01:13:15,473
"and more powerful
you.

1400
01:13:15,523 --> 01:13:16,724
"You

1401
01:13:16,774 --> 01:13:20,689
"will annihilate
and completely destroyed

1402
01:13:20,724 --> 01:13:22,365
"and will do no
covenant with them

1403
01:13:22,415 --> 01:13:25,239
and will show no compassion
toward them. "

1404
01:13:25,274 --> 01:13:26,321
He showed us his favor.

1405
01:13:26,371 --> 01:13:28,773
We are his people.

1406
01:13:28,808 --> 01:13:31,095
And gave us a
king in Saul.

1407
01:13:31,528 --> 01:13:33,214
Now, when,

1408
01:13:33,264 --> 01:13:35,433
the people of Amalek

1409
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:37,553
fought
town of Saul,

1410
01:13:37,603 --> 01:13:40,255
that's what
ordered the Lord God?

1411
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:44,850
I ask the student.

1412
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:46,666
"Crush Amalek.

1413
01:13:46,716 --> 01:13:48,886
Put it under the curse
of destruction ".

1414
01:13:48,936 --> 01:13:50,646
Saul showed mercy?

1415
01:13:50,696 --> 01:13:52,307
In save someone?

1416
01:13:52,357 --> 01:13:54,961
"No, unless... "
"I do not salves,

1417
01:13:55,011 --> 01:13:56,647
"but kills.

1418
01:13:56,697 --> 01:13:58,867
"Murdering men and women,

1419
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,904
"babies and newborns,
oxen and sheep,

1420
01:14:01,954 --> 01:14:04,194
camels and donkeys. "

1421
01:14:04,508 --> 01:14:06,627
Therefore, Saul
prepared to do so,

1422
01:14:06,677 --> 01:14:09,121
and on the way, is
met with the Kenites.

1423
01:14:09,281 --> 01:14:11,596
However, these were not
people of Amalek.

1424
01:14:11,631 --> 01:14:12,926
I had no lawsuits
with them.

1425
01:14:12,961 --> 01:14:15,079
He urged them to
flee.

1426
01:14:15,114 --> 01:14:16,480
And the Lord our God,

1427
01:14:16,515 --> 01:14:20,173
was pleased
Saul's mercy?

1428
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:21,865
For justice to Saul?

1429
01:14:22,733 --> 01:14:24,815
Was not.

1430
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:27,072
And when Saul decided
not all cattle slaughter,

1431
01:14:27,122 --> 01:14:28,759
but take it for
feed its people,

1432
01:14:28,809 --> 01:14:32,713
God was pleased
by his wisdom, his charity?

1433
01:14:32,763 --> 01:14:33,966
No.

1434
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:36,567
No, it was

1435
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:40,516
He said: "You have rejected
the word of Adonai.

1436
01:14:40,566 --> 01:14:44,430
Therefore, he will have
rejected as king. "

1437
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,262
So please search
the Lord our God,

1438
01:14:49,297 --> 01:14:52,191
Samuel brought the King Agag

1439
01:14:52,241 --> 01:14:56,581
and tore it to
the Lord in Gilgal.

1440
01:14:59,184 --> 01:15:02,354
After Saul came David,
who took Batsheba,

1441
01:15:02,404 --> 01:15:05,524
the wife of Uriah the Hittite
for himself

1442
01:15:05,559 --> 01:15:09,165
making arrangements for
Uriah kill...

1443
01:15:09,215 --> 01:15:12,586
against
God's wishes.

1444
01:15:12,636 --> 01:15:15,673
God punished
David for this?

1445
01:15:15,723 --> 01:15:17,485
In a way
to speak.

1446
01:15:17,535 --> 01:15:19,247
Batsheba punished?

1447
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:23,119
In the sense that when...
Adonai said,

1448
01:15:23,169 --> 01:15:26,956
"Since I have sinned
the child will die. "

1449
01:15:27,006 --> 01:15:28,208
Questions before,

1450
01:15:28,258 --> 01:15:30,861
who punishes
a child?

1451
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:33,031
God does.

1452
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:39,107
Now, the child dies suddenly
mercifully, without pain?

1453
01:15:39,157 --> 01:15:42,332
In Chapter 12, we
learned that in reality...

1454
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:44,314
Seven days.

1455
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:49,087
Seven days, children
go die in pain

1456
01:15:49,137 --> 01:15:52,179
while David
wrapped himself

1457
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,678
in bags and
ashes and fasted

1458
01:15:54,728 --> 01:15:57,766
and tried to show
their pain to God.

1459
01:15:58,633 --> 01:16:00,376
He listened to God?

1460
01:16:01,688 --> 01:16:02,531
The child died.

1461
01:16:02,973 --> 01:16:06,445
He knew that child
God was fair?

1462
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:12,085
thought the Amalekites

1463
01:16:12,135 --> 01:16:15,941
that Adonai was fair?

1464
01:16:15,991 --> 01:16:18,161
Did you think the
Mothers of Egypt

1465
01:16:18,211 --> 01:16:21,223
mothers...
thought they

1466
01:16:21,273 --> 01:16:24,236
that Adonai was fair?

1467
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:28,720
But Adonai is our God, segur..
What.. God did not create the Egyptians?

1468
01:16:28,755 --> 01:16:30,618
Do not set up its rivers

1469
01:16:30,668 --> 01:16:32,363
and grew
their crops?

1470
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:34,059
If not him,
Then who?

1471
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:36,108
What... some other god?

1472
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,122
And what created them?

1473
01:16:38,172 --> 01:16:39,808
To punish them?

1474
01:16:39,858 --> 01:16:44,127
To die
hunger, fear,

1475
01:16:44,162 --> 01:16:46,628
to massacre?

1476
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:49,405
The people of Amalek,
the people of Egypt...

1477
01:16:49,455 --> 01:16:52,392
as it was for them

1478
01:16:52,442 --> 01:16:55,721
when Adonai
turned against them?

1479
01:16:58,951 --> 01:17:01,554
Was.

1480
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:10,016
Today, there
a choice, right?

1481
01:17:10,066 --> 01:17:14,573
When David defeated
the Moabites,

1482
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:16,742
What did?

1483
01:17:20,648 --> 01:17:24,504
He had to lie down
on the ground in rows,

1484
01:17:24,554 --> 01:17:28,459
and chose one that will live
and two who will die.

1485
01:17:28,509 --> 01:17:32,353
We've become
in Moab.

1486
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:37,138
We are learning how
went to the Amalekites.

1487
01:17:37,572 --> 01:17:41,911
Faced be extinguished
by Adonai.

1488
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,625
They died for their purpose.

1489
01:17:44,675 --> 01:17:47,289
They fell like us
're falling.

1490
01:17:47,324 --> 01:17:50,590
They were scared as well
us.

1491
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,930
And what did they learn?

1492
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,917
They learned...

1493
01:17:57,967 --> 01:18:01,438
that Adonai,
the Lord our God...

1494
01:18:01,488 --> 01:18:04,066
our God...

1495
01:18:04,116 --> 01:18:06,595
not good.

1496
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:08,847
He is not good.

1497
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:11,050
It was never good.

1498
01:18:11,085 --> 01:18:14,257
He only stayed on our side.

1499
01:18:17,928 --> 01:18:20,048
God is not good.

1500
01:18:20,098 --> 01:18:23,086
Oh, at first
when He repented

1501
01:18:23,136 --> 01:18:26,170
that it had created human beings
human and flooded the land,

1502
01:18:26,205 --> 01:18:27,425
Why?

1503
01:18:27,475 --> 01:18:30,946
they had done to
deserve to be annihilated?

1504
01:18:30,996 --> 01:18:32,198
What could
have done

1505
01:18:32,248 --> 01:18:34,367
to deserve such
slaughter?

1506
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:37,890
What could they have done
that was so bad?

1507
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:40,415
God is not good.

1508
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:43,531
When asked Abraham
to sacrifice his son,

1509
01:18:43,581 --> 01:18:45,700
Abraham should have
said no.

1510
01:18:46,134 --> 01:18:49,605
We should have taught him to our God
Justice was in our hearts.

1511
01:18:49,655 --> 01:18:51,548
We should have faced.

1512
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:54,060
He is not good,
simply has been strong.

1513
01:18:54,095 --> 01:18:56,743
It has simply been
on our side.

1514
01:18:57,416 --> 01:19:00,888
When they brought us here,
they brought in train.

1515
01:19:00,938 --> 01:19:03,950
a guard
slapped me.

1516
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,963
On their belts,
wrote,

1517
01:19:07,013 --> 01:19:09,490
"Gott mit uns".

1518
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,967
"God is with us. "

1519
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:16,773
Now, who says
who is not?

1520
01:19:16,808 --> 01:19:18,246
Maybe it is.

1521
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,717
Is there another explanation?

1522
01:19:21,767 --> 01:19:23,912
What we see here?

1523
01:19:23,962 --> 01:19:26,007
His power...

1524
01:19:26,057 --> 01:19:27,793
His majesty, its strength.

1525
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:31,698
All these things, but
against us.

1526
01:19:32,131 --> 01:19:34,735
He is still God...

1527
01:19:35,169 --> 01:19:38,641
but not our God.

1528
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:41,245
It has become...

1529
01:19:41,295 --> 01:19:43,364
our enemy.

1530
01:19:43,414 --> 01:19:47,970
That is what
happened to the pact.

1531
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:52,526
He has made a new
deal with others.

1532
01:20:22,468 --> 01:20:26,808
We are now entering
to the gas chambers.

1533
01:20:26,858 --> 01:20:28,544
So...
him guilty.

1534
01:20:28,978 --> 01:20:31,239
Found God
guilty, yes,

1535
01:20:31,274 --> 01:20:33,469
for not complying
with the agreement,

1536
01:20:33,519 --> 01:20:35,665
for breaking your
covenant with us.

1537
01:20:36,355 --> 01:20:40,260
Every day 6,000 people were
taken to the gas chambers here.

1538
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,627
39,024.

1539
01:20:52,677 --> 01:20:55,014
38,483.

1540
01:20:57,184 --> 01:20:59,787
38,497.

1541
01:20:59,837 --> 01:21:01,765
38,511.

1542
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:03,643
38,532.

1543
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:07,000
I thought I was going to
calling and called my son.

1544
01:21:07,021 --> 01:21:08,467
Lucky you are.
Please.

1545
01:21:08,517 --> 01:21:09,334
I'm ready.

1546
01:21:09,768 --> 01:21:10,585
He is not ready.

1547
01:21:10,635 --> 01:21:12,592
Please,
Do this for me.

1548
01:21:12,627 --> 01:21:15,209
Send me,
not him.

1549
01:21:15,244 --> 01:21:16,711
38,562.

1550
01:21:17,145 --> 01:21:19,531
38,052.

1551
01:21:19,581 --> 01:21:21,868
38,511.

1552
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,604
Shut up.
Just move.

1553
01:21:23,654 --> 01:21:25,791
Please look at me.
I can be me.

1554
01:21:25,841 --> 01:21:27,928
I am young,
might be useful.

1555
01:21:27,963 --> 01:21:29,836
How can they be
to them and not me? Please

1556
01:21:29,871 --> 01:21:30,547
Nonsense.

1557
01:21:30,597 --> 01:21:31,899
Making Sense
not my job.

1558
01:21:31,949 --> 01:21:34,886
Well, then,
who is?

1559
01:21:34,936 --> 01:21:36,903
I think you're reading
wrong cards.

1560
01:21:36,938 --> 01:21:37,974
Please, just
checked the cards.

1561
01:21:38,024 --> 01:21:39,276
Please checked
cards.

1562
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,010
38,675.

1563
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:43,565
38,692.

1564
01:21:43,615 --> 01:21:45,785
38,695.
You.

1565
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:51,593
What now?

1566
01:21:51,628 --> 01:21:53,980
38,702.

1567
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:57,443
Now that God is guilty,
What now?

1568
01:21:57,493 --> 01:21:57,991
38,711.

1569
01:21:58,041 --> 01:21:59,305
Now...

1570
01:22:00,052 --> 01:22:02,776
now pray.

1571
01:22:04,946 --> 01:22:07,066
39,055.

1572
01:22:07,116 --> 01:22:09,669
"From time to time,

Dust saying... "

Please.

move your butt!

1587

No, no, you
the wrong person!

The boy
is very useful.

It's me you want to.

1591

It's in my...

1592

Look, you've heard
numbers.

1593
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,585
I!
I'm fine.

1594

1595

You, there.

1596
01:22:59,239 --> 01:23:00,515
Move.

1597
01:23:00,565 --> 01:23:03,044
Good man.

1598
01:23:03,094 --> 01:23:04,396
It is not their number.
It's mine.

1599

Back... back!

We are still here.
