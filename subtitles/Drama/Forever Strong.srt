1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,400
Rick, l want to ask you
to be a captain.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,300
''Q'' is already captain.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,200
We always have at least two.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,800
But he can't stand me, the same
with half the guys out there.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,900
This isn't about them.
It's about you.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,600
lt's about being the best Rick.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,900
Well, what about Tumo?

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,300
He and three or four other guys
came to me suggesting you.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,700
The team doesn't get
this kind of stuff wrong.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,400
l know Kurt would have wanted it.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,100
l don't get it.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,100
You know exactly why l'm here,
and you still act like you care.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,900
l'm iust a no-good spy

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,300
who cheap-shotted
your star player last year.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,000
First of all, l attribute that cheap
shot to your coach, not you,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,900
and second, let's focus
on where you could end up,

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,500
not where you were or are.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,400
And... God doesn't make
a no-good anything.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,100
You iust got to learn to listen

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,500
and pay attention
to that spirit inside you.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,800
And learning to listen,
that takes a lot of discipline.

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,900
So that's why all the rules?

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,200
We only have one real rule --

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
don't do anything

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,300
that would embarrass you,
the team, or your family.

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,900
l can't be captain.

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,200
Some friends of mine
sent me some stuff.

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,300
Vicodin.

29
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,000
But l don't have it anymore.
l got rid of it.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,500
Man!

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,800
l cannot believe
you made me tell you that.

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,300
Much to your credit, Rick,
l didn't make you.

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,900
And good decisions
don't make life easy.

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,500
But they do make it easier.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,400
You're gonna have
to sit out the Boise game.

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,000
But l'm sure you'll find a way

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,600
to captain your forwards
from the sidelines.

38
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,400
Welcome to Highland Rugby, Rick.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thanks.

40
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Kurt was with me
when my father died.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,600
He told me that although
his body was gone,

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,000
his spirit would always
be with me.

43
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Every time l do the haka,

44
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,600
l call on the power
of my family spirit.

45
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,500
We'll call upon Kurt's spirit now, too.

46
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,400
Kurt...

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,600
...he was a real friend.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,700
lf it wasn't for him,
l wouldn't be on this team.

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,400
He made me want
to be a better person.

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,200
l'm gonna miss that.

51
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,800
You boys might think
l coach because...

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,200
...l love rugby
and l love to win.

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,600
Both true.

54
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,700
But l keep coaching
because of you guys.

55
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,800
That's why l'm more interested
in turning out champion boys

56
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,300
than champion teams.

57
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,300
l want you to be forever strong
on the field

58
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,100
so you'll be forever strong off it.

59
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,100
Kia kaha -- forever strong.

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,600
ALL: Kia kaha.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,600
Ka mate, ka mate

62
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,000
Ka mate, ka mate

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,500
ALL: Ka mate, ka mate
Ka ora, ka ora...

64
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,000
Come on, Phipp! l want a nice toss!

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
Give me a nice toss, baby!

66
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,800
Let's go, Griggsie!

67
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,600
Bring it down!
Protect the ball!

68
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,000
Protect the ball!

69
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,100
Protect it!

70
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Get it up! Get it up!

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,700
Run! Run! Go!

72
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Go!

73
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,100
Go!

74
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,600
Yes!

75
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,100
That is what l'm talking about!

76
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,000
Whoo!

77
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah, give me some!

78
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,100
Yeah! Whoo!

79
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,500
l think l liked him better
on the field.

80
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,900
RADlO ANNOUNCER: Well
much of the story this seaso'n

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,800
has been Highland's
commitment to team play,

82
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,400
and after crushing
the Boise team today,

83
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,100
they're in the Pacific Coast
drivers seat

84
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,900
to be the number-one seed
at the nationals

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,400
in Colorado Springs.

86
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,000
Settle down! Settle down!

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hey, nice win, guys.

88
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,900
That's the way
to take care of business.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,900
Whoo-hoo!

90
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Oh, Griggs!
You stink, man!

91
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,300
Take a shower!

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
What you say, huh?

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,300
-Yeah!
-Griggs, man.

94
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,500
To the back of the bus.

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Hey, come on, Griggsie.
A little mercy, man.

96
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,000
lt's a winning tradition.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,300
lt's a stinking tradition!

98
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,600
You know where the losers sit?

99
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,300
ln the front of the bus, yeah.
That's right.

100
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,800
How'd you like to scrum with that?

101
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,900
RADlO ANNOUNCER:
Since the tragic death

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,100
of team player
Kurt Addison eight weeks ago,

103
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,200
this Highland team has been
nothing but unstoppable.

104
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,600
They'll be returning home
with the regional title

105
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,400
and be headed
to the USA Rugby Nationals

106
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,900
later this month.

107
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,300
What about you?
No family, Griggsie?

108
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,900
No, my parents split up.

109
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,000
My dad's in prison.

110
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,700
My mom,
she's a stripper out in Vegas,

111
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,300
or Reno or something like that.

112
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,800
l don't know. l don't remember.

113
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,300
Man, l'm sorry. l thought
that l had it bad, but you --

114
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,500
lt's all good.

115
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,200
You loser. You lied?

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,000
You know,
this little trust bridge we had here

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
iust burned
and went right down the river.

118
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,200
But they're always late, so...

119
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,500
Oh, look. It's my mother.

120
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
That's a big mama.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
Ooh, put your tongue away, dude.

122
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,100
She don't like the drooling,
'cause l already tried that.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,800
-Yeah, how long have they been--
-Together?

124
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,000
-Yeah.
-Since birth.

125
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,900
That's ''Q's'' sister Emily.
You did not know that?

126
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,800
What?

127
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,700
RICK: This has got even better.

128
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,000
l wouldn't touch it, man.
She's twitchy as a bunch of nuns.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,900
-She's the Holy Grail.
-Yeah, uh-huh.

130
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,700
l tried.

131
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,600
You must be the sisters
that ''Q'' has been telling me about.

132
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,400
What are you doing?

133
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,100
No, l've never said a word
to him about you.

134
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,500
Well, you should have.

135
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Yeah. You should have.

136
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,500
No. l shouldn't have.

137
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
Rick Penning.

138
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,300
Emily Owens.

139
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,000
You know,
l've been watching you play.

140
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,700
You're actually really good.

141
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,200
Well, thank you.
It's very nice of you to notice.

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
-Oh, well--
-''Q'': We're going.

143
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,700
Okay, l think l'm leaving now,

144
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
but it was nice
to officially meet you!

145
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,800
No, it wasn't.

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,700
Hey, ''Q''!

147
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,600
l'll see you tomorrow
at 4:OO for practice

148
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
where we usually
hang out afterwards

149
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,900
and grab a bite to eat!

150
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,700
You a pineapple, brother.

151
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,100
What?

152
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,200
All hard and ugly
and spiny on the outside.

153
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,700
Nothing but sweet
and mushy under.

154
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, you got it bad.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,800
lt's not even like that, brah.

156
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,100
You know, you guys
are going to nationals.

157
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Making Marcus
one happy brother.

158
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,600
Hey.

159
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,200
Dad!
What are you doing here?

160
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,700
l'm taking you home.

161
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,100
Marcus, l told you l wanted
to finish out the season.

162
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,900
l know,

163
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,800
but based on the last two
positive evaluations l gave you,

164
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
the iudge released you
from the wardship,

165
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,300
placing you back
in the custody of your parents.

166
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,300
So what does that mean?

167
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,100
lt means grab your stuff.
You're coming home.

168
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,600
Dad, l can't.
l'm the team captain!

169
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,900
You're still the captain,
of the Razorbacks.

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,400
l'm sorry.
Look, see the positive here.

171
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,000
You did it.

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,600
You got probation. You're
not going to a county lockdown.

173
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,800
Thanks for everything.

174
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,800
Okay. Okay. That's real sweet.

175
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,200
This isn't summer camp.
Let's go.

176
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,700
You keep listening right, okay?

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,100
All right, Bingham.

178
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,000
Enough with the kumbayahs,
all right?

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,100
Nice.

180
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,200
lt's good to have you home.

181
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,000
Thanks.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,900
You know, tomorrow at practice,

183
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Rick is gonna
Iay out Highland's playbook.

184
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,200
You know, whatever you've got
that you think we need,

185
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,800
you know, specific plays,
zoning, substitution strategies,

186
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
you iust let it rip, okay?

187
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,700
You know, we're gonna
end up playing against them

188
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,400
at Colorado Springs.

189
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,000
This is our year.

190
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,200
We deserve that title.

191
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,400
What do you mean ''we''?

192
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
My team is Highland.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,200
Okay, you see,
you don't get to choose.

194
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,400
You will leave this house or not
if we say.

195
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,800
You will drive that car or not
if we say.

196
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,000
You will go to Colorado or not
if l say,

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and right now l say
that you will be at practice

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,900
with your Razorbacks tomorrow.

199
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,300
Rick, sit down.

200
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,500
Have me arrested.

201
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,200
What was that about?

202
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,000
What did l say wrong?

203
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,600
He's been gone a year,

204
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,300
and the only thing
you can talk about

205
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,100
is having him teach
some stupid plays to your team?

206
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Stupid plays? Okay, look.
It's his team, too.

207
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,900
Didn't you hear him?

208
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,300
The Razorbacks
aren't his team anymore.

209
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
He doesn't know
what he wants anymore, honey.

210
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,300
Have you asked him?

211
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
l only want him
to have what l never had.

212
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,300
And what makes you think
that he wants what you never had?

213
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
What about what he wants?

214
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,000
What he wants landed him in iail.

215
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
What is more important, Richard?

216
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,600
A game or two or your son?

217
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,700
Look at him.

218
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
lf playing for this team

219
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:00,000
is making him more like the man
that we want him to be,

220
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,200
if it's making him happy --

221
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,000
lt's in his eyes.

222
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,000
Just open yours, and you'll see it.

223
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,600
Okay, l'll try. Okay?

224
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,900
You try. You sit.
This is about doing, Coach.

225
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,200
Hey, Rick!

226
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,300
What's up, man?

227
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
What's up, man?
When did you get back?

228
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,500
Here, let me look at you.

229
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Oh, Tami, l'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

230
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,800
l'm fine.
l just want you to kiss me.

231
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,900
Oh, Tami, come on.

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Baby, what's wrong?
Aren't you excited to see me?

233
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,600
Tami, please.

234
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,300
Guys, l'm on probation, man.

235
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
You guys got to lose this.
Put it in the truck or something.

236
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,500
Oh, come on, Mr. Paranoid.

237
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,200
You really see a probation schmo
around here?

238
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,100
TAMl: l missed you.

239
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,500
-No.
-Lars.

240
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,900
Lars, l'm serious, man.
Don't put it in here.

241
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,400
Okay, well, you're still taking us
for a little ride afterward.

242
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
Come on, man.
You owe us one.

243
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,100
Rick, this is it.

244
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,700
This is our year!

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,900
This is it!

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
-Am l right?
-Absolutely.

247
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,700
Seriously, though, the team --
We're pure stoked

248
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,700
to have you back to give us
the Highland hookup

249
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,300
on all their plays and stuff.

250
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,700
You want the Highland hookup?

251
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
One, there's none of this, all right?

252
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,000
lt's about character and honor.

253
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
What's he talking about?

254
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,900
l'm sorry, uh...

255
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,300
...character and honor?

256
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,800
Yeah, and we also don't do anything
to embarrass ourselves, our families,

257
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,000
or our team.

258
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,000
Hey! Whoa!

259
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,700
What, so, you don't drink now?

260
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Rick, you're talking
like you still play for them.

261
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,900
You want to know what Highland
teaches? Well, l'm telling you.

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Yeah, yeah, we want plays.
Maybe illegal hits.

263
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,200
You really think we want you
to come around here

264
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,100
and start teaching Sunday School?

265
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,500
Come on, man.
This ain't you.

266
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,700
You know what, guys?

267
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,600
l'm going to practice.

268
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,100
Lars, man,
Iet's just get out of here.

269
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,300
Well, the old Rick used to take it
any way he could get it.

270
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,400
You should suck it up.

271
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,200
Rick, what's wrong with you?

272
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,900
What's happened to you, Rick?

273
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,000
Where's the loyalty, man?

274
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,400
l mean, we've been talking about
beating Highland for the title

275
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,400
since we were little kids.

276
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,800
Lars, man,
Iet's just go, all right?

277
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,500
Let's iust go, okay?

278
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,100
Highland is a bunch
of choir boys, Rick!

279
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah, and you're drunk.

280
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,100
So?

281
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
So, we're not doing this.
l'm going to practice.

282
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,700
No, Rick. Come on!

283
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,000
LARS: All right, well, maybe we
just don't want you at practice.

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,800
Maybe you should, uh, hightail it
back to Highland, huh?

285
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,700
GIRL: Lars, don't be an idiot!

286
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,700
TAMl: Come on, you guys!

287
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,100
You know, a year ago you
would have killed me for that.

288
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,800
l said, ''l'm not doing this.''

289
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,900
LARS: No...

290
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,700
TAMl: Lars! Stop!
You guys, stop!

291
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,600
Get a little zip on that thing.

292
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,700
Get off of him!

293
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,500
TAMl: Stop, you guys!

294
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Get off him, man!

295
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,800
lt's the cops! It's the cops!

296
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,300
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

297
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,200
Back lines! Let's go!

298
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,700
Move it! Go!

299
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:45,700
l give you the keys to the car,
and this is what l get.

300
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,000
After what l've been through
the last year,

301
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,900
do you really believe

302
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
that l'd be messing with drugs
and booze the day l get home?

303
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,600
Okay, there were drugs and beer
all over you and the car.

304
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,100
lt was Lars and Marty.

305
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,700
Test me.
l haven't had a drink in a year.

306
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,900
Rick, do you have any idea
how much potential you had?

307
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,900
Lars set me up!

308
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,800
See, my future was stolen.

309
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,100
You're not even listening.

310
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,700
FATH E R:
And what are you doing?

311
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,700
You're iust throwing it all away?
For what? Drugs?

312
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,600
Booze? Some girl?

313
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,500
So, l guess what l said really
doesn't even make a difference.

314
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,200
Rick, it kills me to sit back and
watch you throw everything away.

315
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,300
l mean,
when are you gonna dig deep

316
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,100
and first-string
the real Rick Penning?

317
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,400
You want to talk
about first-stringing a Penning?

318
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,600
You won nationals in 1 986.

319
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,700
You were on the original
Highland Rugby team!

320
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,700
You were
a Highland Rugby player.

321
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,100
l didn't win anything.

322
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,700
You were on the team.
You know what they taught.

323
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,300
l was on nothing.

324
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,100
l saw your picture, Dad.
You were on the team.

325
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,700
No. Gelwix made sure
that l wasn't on that team

326
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,200
by putting me someplace
that l shouldn't have been.

327
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,100
l told him,

328
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,700
but he insisted
that l play a forward.

329
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,300
He was doing what was best
for you and the team.

330
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,500
No, no, Gelwix stole my life!

331
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,600
Well, he's given me mine back!

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,100
l play for Highland.

333
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,500
l am benched
for drugs and alcohol,

334
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,100
suspended for lying.

335
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:42,500
l don't do anything to embarrass
myself, my team, or my family.

336
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,500
Not anymore.

337
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,000
Highland Rugby.

338
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,000
Kia kaha.

339
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,900
l'm done.

340
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
Rick.

341
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Rick.

342
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,900
Rick!

343
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,700
He was caught with the drugs, Larry.

344
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,000
He was changing.
You saw it. We all saw it.

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
Well, that's why
l fought with the courts

346
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,900
to try and keep him at Wasatch.

347
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
When l heard
they were discharging him,

348
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
l told them he wasn't ready.

349
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,300
Maybe you both should have
a little bit more faith in him.

350
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,600
Maybe.

351
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,000
-Good night, Coach.
-Good night.

352
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,700
l know how much
you cared about this boy.

353
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,100
And when l can't help
these young men

354
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,600
become champions
in their own lives, it's...

355
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,100
Maybe it is time.

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,700
You're out, man.
Come on. Let's go.

357
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,300
Move it!

358
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,200
Mom.

359
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,900
Tami, what's going on?

360
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,900
Larry Gelwix called.

361
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,300
We talked for a long time.

362
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,600
He wouldn't let me off the phone

363
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,500
until l promised
to do some digging.

364
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Tami told the police
what really happened.

365
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,300
l thought you were with Lars
and Marty on this.

366
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,700
Maybe l didn't want
to hold you back anymore.

367
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,600
Where's Dad?

368
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,000
Your dad thought
you might be able to use this.

369
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,000
He also said that he knew you
wouldn't be able to respect him

370
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,500
unless he still tried
to beat Highland,

371
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
even with you as their hook.

372
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,000
Let's get out of here.

373
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,200
Thanks, Tami.

374
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,400

Glad you're here, Rick.

392
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,700
Thanks for having me back.

393
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,900
All right,
Iook around, gentlemen.

394
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,800
This is what you've been chasing.

395
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,100
Now, l want it clean,

396
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,900
but these guys need to know
that they don't belong here.

397
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,600
l want you to hit 'em so hard,
you make 'em cry.

398
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
You hearing me, Peeta?

399
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Yes, Coach.

400
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,000
Make 'em cry.

401
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,800
Yeah! Way to go, buddy!

402
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,300
ANNOUNCER: Highland is iust
chewing East Lansing up

403
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,200
and spitting them out.

404
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,600
l tell you, Max, you do not
want to give Highland an inch

405
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,800
because they will
take the whole mile.

406
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,400
This game is over.
Highland cleans house, 61-3.

407
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,100
Who's missing a tooth?

408
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,300
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

409
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,700

Ieaving the 1 and 2 seeds,

00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,800
the flagstaff
and Highland teams advancing.

413
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,800
LARS: Hey!

414
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,600
lf it isn't the Highland choir boys.

415
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,800
Knock it off, Lars.

416
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,100
We're iust surprised to see you
out in the free world, Penning.

417
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,800
You know, we're actually
hoping you guys keep winning,

418
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,200
so we can play you in the finals,

419
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,400
because you will become
a very popular guy.

420
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,200
What's it up to now?

421
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,600
lt's like --
What do we got? 235?

422
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,300
$235 to whoever
takes you out of the game.

423
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,500
ls that right?

424
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,500
You...

425
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,000
Uh, Peeta? It's okay.

426
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,700
Come on, brah. Let's go! Let's go!
It's not even worth it, man.

427
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,700
Not even worth it.

428
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,900
Trembling there a little bit, Lars.

429
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,400
Yeah, l think l peed iust a little bit.

430
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,600
Just a little.

431
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,800
This is six!

432
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,200
ANNOUNCER: Highland steals
the ball and passes it out.

433
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,300
They hit the gap and took it.

434
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,700
Boy, just look at Swindle
breaking the line

435
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,800
and putting on the gas.

436
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,100
He is making some serious yards.

437
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And we have a ruck
in the midfield.

438
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,700
Oh, a quick ball out.

439
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,500
There's a kick ahead.
And there it is.

440
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,900
Highland's fullback, Quentin Owens,

441
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,800
sweeps it up
for some easy try time.

442
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,600
This is a big cleanup
by Highland.

443
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,800
They're very, very serious
contenders in this tournament.

444
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,200
That was for me.

445
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,800
Good evening.

446
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,100
That worked, yeah?

447
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,900
You guys are sick.

448
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
GRIGGS:
No, get back in, Mark.

449
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,200
They're coming.
They're coming. They're coming.

450
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,000
MARK: Griggsie?

451
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,800
Griggs, are you there?

452
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,100
Griggs, let me out of here, man!
Come on! This ain't funny!

453
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,700
OTHERS: Yee-hah!

454
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,100
MARK: Griggsie,
get back here, man!

455
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,900
Coach, any predictions
on the match?

456
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,700
Oh, we're looking forward
to the challenge.

457
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
My boys have worked
very hard to get here,

458
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,100
and may the best team win.

459
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,800
l understand your son
is playing for Highland.

460
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,100
What's it going to be like
coaching against him?

461
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,800
Uh...

462
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,400
Coach, is it true you used to play
for this Highland team?

463
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,700
Thank you.

464
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,200
Pizza time, baby!

465
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,300
lt's more fun
when you turn it on, brah.

466
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,900
Hey, uh, why don't you guys

467
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,000
go torment some menace
in the hallway or something?

468
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,600
GRIGGS: All right. Hurry up.
Peeta eat it all.

469
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Hey, let's go
watch Sanchez work out!

470
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,000
TEAMMATE:
Sanchez works out?

471
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,800
And l have a 4.O GPA.

472
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,500
You want to talk
about your grades?

473
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,300
For the last year and a half,

474
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,400
l've been paying guys
to get test answers for me.

475
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,200
You know, l have lived
my whole life for my parents.

476
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,600
Line by line,
what they wanted me to do.

477
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,300
Highland Rugby is the only thing
that l do for me.

478
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,200
l mean, l have lived
the last four years of my life

479
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,100
so that l can play as a senior
for the national title.

480
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,100
And here it is.

481
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,900
And l'm this close.

482
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,600
l'm trying to stay true to my parents,

483
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,300
l haven't been true
to the one thing

484
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,700
that means the most to me...

485
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,900
...my brothers on the team.

486
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
l'm sorry. l iust, uh,
had to tell somebody, you know?

487
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,800
You're not gonna tell coach, are you?

488
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,900
That's not my iob.

489
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,400
Right.

490
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,300
G E LWIX:
''Q'' just came to see me.

491
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Thanks for being
a positive influence on him.

492
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,000
-RICK: That's funny.
-GELWIX: No, no. It's true.

493
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,400
And you gonna play him?

494
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,600
GELWIX: What do you think?

495
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,600
Well...

496
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
...he is a captain.

497
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,400
And he scores most of our points.

498
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,200
Might not win without him.

499
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,600
Glad l'm not the coach right now.

500
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
l'm glad l'm not Quentin's father
right now.

501
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,100
He iust flew in for the finals.

502
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,000
When l was 13,

503
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,900
my father went with me
to a father-and-son dinner.

504
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,900
lt was the only time he ever went
with me to anything like that.

505
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,900
One time.

506
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,800
l never knew if he cared.

507
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,800
l took his absence
as a lack of love.

508
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,500
l never felt like l was good enough.
Never felt like l measured up.

509
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,100
And it took me 40 years
to forgive him.

510
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,400
And when you got arrested...

511
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,800
...l told the lovely Mrs. Gelwix,
''lt's time to retire.''

512
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,300
Then l got a call from your father.

513
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,900
lt was the first time we talked
since that 1 986 season.

514
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,600
And he said that the son
he lost a year ago

515
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,600
wasn't the same one
he found sitting in jail.

516
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,500
You're where l was 40 years ago.

517
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,100
Don't spend another minute
being angry about yesterday.

518
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,400
Free him, and you free yourself.

519
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,900
Better get some sleep.

520
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Big game tomorrow.

538
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,200
He said you took the time
to listen, and you're a real friend.

539
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,500
He said that?

540
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,400
Well, you're welcome.

541
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,900

00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,500

544
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Good luck.

545
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,700
Thanks.

546
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,200
See you after the game?

547
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,800
Uh, yeah.

548
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
You can count on that.

549
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,300
-Hey, wrong bench, Penning.
-Look who it is.

550
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,400
-Sweat it.
-What's up, traitor?

551
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,000
-Rick.
-Welcome back.

552
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,500
Hey, you don't belong
over here, traitor.

553
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,100
You shouldn't be over here.

554
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,300
l iust wanted to say

556
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,300

like what you wanted me to be.

557
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,300

You will play your best game, right?

562
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,300
Let's go!

563
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,600
Better stay on your toes, Rick.

564
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,900
There's 280 bucks on your head.

565
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,100
You're going down and out, pal.

566
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,600
Why's he smiling?

567
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,500
Let's crack open his head
and find out.

568
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,900
Ka mate! Ka mate!

569
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,400
ALL: Ka ora! Ka ora!

570
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,100
Ka mate! Ka mate!
Ka ora! Ka ora!

571
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,000
Tenei te tangata
Puhuru huru

572
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,400
Nana i tiki mai
Whakawhiti te ra

573
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,600
A, upa... ne!
A, upa... ne!

574
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,300
A upane, ka upane
Whiti te ra... Hi!

575
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Get it wide! Get it wide!

576
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,400
ANNOUNCER:
At the 6:07 mark in the first half,

577
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,400
the score --
Highland, 5, flagstaff, O.

578
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
That was a cheap hit!

579
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,300
-Keep the tackles low.
-Oh, come on!

580
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,400
Number 7, 10 in the bench.

581
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,200
ANNOUNCER:
Your attention please.

582
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,000
Yellow-card caution issued
to Razorbacks number 7.

583
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,700
Let's go! Support, support!

584
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,900
Now, it's not really known
why Highland is going without

585
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,400
their star fullback,
Quentin Owens today

586
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,400
but the loss, l'm telling you,

587
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,400
has got to be felt
by the rest of the team.

588
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,600
And that conversion
by Highland right there

589
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
ties us back up,

590
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,900
so it's Highland, 14,
flagstaff, 14.

591
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,300
lt is anybody's game.

592
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,300
Ruck over! Ruck over!

593
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,300
And Highland puts on the skills
and makes their move.

594
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
Oh, they get the turnover
and kick it out.

595
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,300
Cover the line! Cover the line!

596
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,800
And the line-out
goes to Arizona at the 22.

597
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,600
They're killing us out there, dude.
We've got to take Penning out.

598
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,700
All right. You go high.

599
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,900
Oh, yeah!

600
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,700
Straight line! Line it up!

601
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,600
Hey, hey, hey!

602
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,800
-Throw it to Penning.
-What?

603
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,100
Get it right to him.

604
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,900
Back to first jumper!

605
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,900
Switch out on me.

606
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,200
Watch the ball! Watch the ball!
Watch it!

607
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,000
-That'll be 1 O minutes.
-Oh, come on!

608
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,000
REFEREE: Ten minutes!

609
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,500
That's a red card!

610
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,900
Colton, the Razorbacks
are getting off easy

611
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,000
with a yellow card
and 1 O minutes in the sin-bin.

612
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,600
l tell you, if it were me,
l'd be sitting the kid.

613
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,100
280, boy! 280!

614
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
COACH PENNING: Marty!
You're out. Sit.

615
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,400
-What are you talking about?
-You're through.

616
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,600
Hey, come on.
We're gonna lose without Marty.

617
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,300
One more word out of you,
and you'll be sitting with him.

618
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,000
Everybody stand back.
Let me check him out.

619
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,300
G E LWIX:
Back off, guys. Back off.

620
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,300
Give him some room, okay?

621
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,900
All right, take it easy, Rick.

622
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,300
Doc's gonna have a look at you, son.

623
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,200
Okay, l'm gonna check your neck.

624
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,200
Just lay still. Lay still, okay?
You'll be okay.

625
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,300
l think he's gonna be okay.

626
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,500
Coach, uh, can l...?
Can l, um...?

627
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,900
Thank you.

628
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,700
Hey.

629
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,900
Look, Rick,
you have a choice here.

630
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,200
You either get up
and finish this game,

631
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,500
or you stay down...

632
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,400
...and you end up like me.

633
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,600
ANNOUNCER: _nd he breaks
the line and turns on the power.

634
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,100
He outsmarts them all
and takes it to the line,

635
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,500
so it's Highland, 1 9,
flagstaff, 14.

636
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,600
And with time iust under 5 minutes,

637
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,400
it is still a toss-up
as to who will win this game.

638
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,400
Come on, pass it out! Let's go!

639
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,600
ANNOUNCER:
Number 1 1's got the moves,

640
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,300
and he's got the 5 points!

641
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,000
That is the third try for Arizona,

642
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,500
and the second try
for Lars Murphy in this game.

643
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,200
ANNOUNCER:
Arizona's back in business!

644
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,000
That was the try that can
turn this entire game around.

645
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,300
Both teams are playing very well

646
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
under the extreme pressure
for the title.

647
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,600
ANNOUNCER: Now this score has
guaranteed us a real cliffhanger

648
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,200
as we move into the last two
minutes of this intense match.

649
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,300
There we go! There we go!
Come on!

650
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,400
Go, Rick. Go, Rick!

Run!

654
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,700
Penning is down at the try line
in a huge pileup!

655
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,200
l can't see.

656
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,500
We're still waiting
for the official to make the call.

657
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,600
REFEREE: Out of the away!
Move away. Let me see it.

658
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,600
