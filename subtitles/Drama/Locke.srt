00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:03,559
<i>Hi, this is Bethan.
I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

2
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:05,561
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

3
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:10,066
Hi, it's Ivan. I got your message.

4
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,027
I'm on my way and I'll get there.

5
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,405
I'm in the car now and...

6
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,534
It will be about an hour and a half,
unless there's traffic.

7
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,786
Now, if the nurses or anybody
wants to talk to me,

8
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,746
I'm only on this number.

9
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,916
Or if the doctors or anybody at all,

10
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,751
if they need to talk to me,
I'll be on this number.

11
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,004
Now, it'll be okay.

12
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:35,466
I will get there
and the traffic should be okay.

13
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:53,943
Hello, can I speak to Gareth, please?

14
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,946
<i>He's not back yet. Can I ask who's calling?</i>

15
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:58,406
It's Ivan Locke.

16
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,909
<i>- Can I say what it's regarding?
- Yes, concrete.</i>

17
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,454
Can you... Can you tell him that it's urgent?

18
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,080
Can you tell him to call me back?

19
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,665
<i>Yep. Does he have your number?</i>

20
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,625
Yes. Yes, he does.

21
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,296
<i>- Sorry, what was your name again?
- lvan Locke.</i>

22
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:16,632
<i>- Something about concrete?
- That's fight, yes. Can you...</i>

23
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,344
<i>- Will he know what?
- No, no, he won't.</i>

24
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:25,266
Something has come up
and I need to tell people. It's urgent.

25
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,643
- Sorry, what?
- I said... I said it's urgent.

26
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,146
Very urgent. Thank you.

27
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,096
<i>Hello?</i>

28
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,016
Eddie, it's your dad. ls your mother there?

29
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,352
<i>No, she's not back from the shops yet.</i>

30
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:12,688
<i>She's getting that German beer that you like
for the match.</i>

31
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:15,358
Okay. Listen, I won't be back for that.

32
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,151
<i>What?</i>

33
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,738
Something's come up. I can't get out of it.

34
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,699
<i>I'm wearing the shirt.
Mum's getting sausages.</i>

35
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,369
<i>Yeah, and guess what?
She's wearing the shirt as well.</i>

36
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,038
<i>Dad, it is so embarrassing.</i>

37
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,582
<i>Yeah, what did you say
about coming home?</i>

38
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,043
I won't be back for the match.

39
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,879
I'll have to listen to it on the radio.

40
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,550
<i>Dad, you said you'd be back.
It's rubbish on the radio.</i>

41
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,927
<i>Mum's doing sausages and all.</i>

42
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,556
ls your brother there?

43
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:50,393
<i>- Yeah. Do you want a word?
- No. Just tell...</i>

44
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,062
Can you just tell your mother to call me
when she gets back? Thank you.

45
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,397
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- Eddie, come on.</i>

46
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:55,815
- I <i>love</i> you.
<i>- It's started.</i>

47
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,066
<i>What?</i>

48
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,485
It's okay. Do you know what?

49
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:02,029
Just get her to call me when she gets back.
Thank you.

50
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,740
<i>- All right. Bye, Dad.
- Bye, bye.</i>

51
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,553
Ivan Locke.

52
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:29,765
<i>I just got your message. It's a joke, is it?</i>

53
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:33,561
Look, I know it's a shock, but it will be okay.

54
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,272
<i>Okay-</i>

55
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:40,401
Yes, well, I will go through everything
with you and it'll be okay.

56
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,195
<i>You know where I am, Ivan?
I'm at the service station.</i>

57
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,114
<i>I'm turning the fucking van around.</i>

58
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,491
<i>I put a few other lads on the hard shoulder.
I was halfway home.</i>

59
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:50,620
<i>- Yeah.
- What the fuck's happened?</i>

60
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:53,497
- lt's a family thing.
- Right.

61
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:57,460
<i>Is someone... Has... ls it a bereavement?</i>

62
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,503
I don't have a choice.

63
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,924
<i>Is it one of the kids?</i>

64
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:07,428
Donal, look, I just need you to fix this up
and be all right, okay? And solid.

65
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,306
Which you are. Which you are, okay?

66
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:13,768
Just from when the sun comes up
tomorrow morning

67
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:16,103
until when it's all been pumped.

68
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,522
I need you to hold it together for me, okay?

69
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:21,150
You won't be alone. I will be on the phone.

70
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,236
I will talk to you every 5 minutes
until the pump is finished.

71
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,155
<i>- Talk to me, what, on the phone?
- On the phone.</i>

72
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,200
<i>What? Have you gone mad?</i>

73
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,493
No, I don't think so.

74
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,828
<i>Ivan, at 5:45 tomorrow morning,</i>

75
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:37,166
<i>we have 350 metric tons of wet concrete
being delivered to the site.</i>

76
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:41,045
<i>We've got 200 trucks from all over the
fucking country descending on us at 5:45.</i>

77
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,175
355 metric tons and 218 trucks.

78
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,262
<i>Okay, this is a joke, is it?</i>

79
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,807
I have no choice.

80
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:57,353
<i>Ivan, look, I hate myself
even hearing myself saying this,</i>

81
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,480
<i>but if someone has died,
like your mother or...</i>

82
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,232
<i>- No one 'vs dead, Dona.
- ...just go where you have to</i>

83
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,274
<i>go tomorrow after 12:00.</i>

84
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,443
I need you to just do this, okay?

85
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:07,446
I need you to be there with enough stuff

86
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,532
and the right heads when the sun comes up.
That's it.

87
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:15,037
<i>Holy fucking Mary!
I can't. I'm a fucking concrete farmer.</i>

88
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,373
<i>You've never seen me
read anything written down on paper.</i>

89
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,291
<i>- I can't...
- You're okay. Listen, you're okay.</i>

90
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,004
You know how to run a pump, don't you?
You know how to run trucks back to back

91
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,964
and turn trucks back,
and you know how to test for slumps.

92
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,299
<i>I've never even shoveled on a pump this big!</i>

93
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:29,218
Well, it's the same.
It's just there's more of it.

94
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:32,471
You just...
You just do the same but for longer.

95
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:36,308
You check it, slump it,
send it back if it's piss

96
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,102
and pump it if it's right. That's it.

97
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,859
<i>- What does Gareth say about this?</i>
- I <i>haven't spoken to him yet.</i>

98
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:47,236
<i>Well, he's gonna fucking... He's gonna...</i>

99
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,530
<i>He'll go fucking sideways
around the houses...</i>

100
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,740
I know.

101
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,576
<i>- ...like his arse is on fire.
- I know.</i>

102
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,996
- I know.
- lvan, you're gonna get the sack.

103
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,372
I know, Donal.

104
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:03,044
<i>Jesus, you're the best foreman
I've ever fucking worked with!</i>

105
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,588
<i>The best site manager. What the hell is it</i>

106
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,090
<i>that's gonna make you go and risk...
You're gonna risk the sack?</i>

107
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,510
Look, I need you
to do this for me, Donal, right?

108
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:15,097
So, start rounding up some cowboys
and then call me back.

109
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,724
I'll be on the road.

110
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,786
- Ivan Locke.
- lvan?

111
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,788
Where are you?

112
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,248
<i>I just got admitted.</i>

113
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,793
<i>I'm in the labor ward. It's called Bailey Ward.</i>

114
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,294
Did they say how long?

115
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:47,963
<i>- I 'm 5 centimeters.
- What does that mean?</i>

116
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,759
- Dilated.
- I know what that means, but how long?

117
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:55,054
<i>I... They just... They just left me.
I'm on my own.</i>

118
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,306
- ls there a bell?
- A <i>what?</i>

119
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,601
I don't know, a buzzer
or something to get a nurse.

120
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,312
<i>They just put their head round
and they said it could be hours.</i>

121
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,814
Are you okay?

122
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,984
- I need the loo.
- Well, tell them. Tell them.

123
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,570
<i>- Well, there's no one here.
- Well, is there</i> a bell?

124
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,615
<i>They don't have bells. What do you mean?</i>

125
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,284
When they put their head around the door,

126
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,287
you tell them that you need the lavatory.

127
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,210
<i>It's like a pain I've never had right inside,
all the way up to my chest.</i>

128
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,629
Have you talked to anyone about the pain?

129
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,006
<i>No, what... What do you mean?</i>

130
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:34,301
<i>Ivan, what do you mean?</i>

131
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,429
I'm saying, have you talked to anybody
about stopping the pain?

132
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,850
- Have <i>you decided?
- Well, they said let's see.</i>

133
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,852
Well, just have whatever there is, seriously.

134
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,312
- What?
- I don't know. For the pain.

135
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,065
Because it's fucking... Jesus, it's...

136
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,236
<i>It's cold and all the windows are open.</i>

137
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,156
Tell them to close the windows.

138
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,616
And the traffic is okay. Go to the lavatory.

139
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,327
I'll be there.

140
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,543
<i>Have you even told your wife
that someone's having your baby?</i>

141
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,547
I'm about to do that.

142
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:17,052
I have... I have a list of things
that I have to do tonight while I'm driving.

143
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:20,097
- So, am I on a list?
- Yes. Tonight, yes.

144
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,476
<i>Do you love me?</i>

145
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,356
That's a question you're asking
probably because of the pain or something.

146
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,275
How could I love you?

147
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,694
I-

148
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,905
Hell.

149
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,335
<i>Hi, love.</i>

150
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,088
- Hello, Katrina.
- Hi, love.

151
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:57,927
<i>Look, I got you six of the German lagers
and I got sausages.</i>

152
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,931
<i>I thought we could have hot dogs again.
And guess what?</i>

153
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,392
<i>I am finally wearing the shirt.</i>

154
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,687
<i>Ivan?</i>

155
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,606
Did Eddie not give you the message?

156
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,985
<i>- What message?
- I'm not coming home.</i>

157
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,780
<i>What?</i>

158
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,698
<i>What do you mean?</i>

159
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,909
<i>It's the match. I'm wearing the shirt.</i>

160
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,827
Which phone are you on?

161
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,747
<i>- What do you mean?
- I can hear the TV.</i>

162
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:30,459
Can you take this call upstairs,
on the phone upstairs?

163
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,294
<i>Upstairs? Why?</i>

164
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,463
I have something...

165
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,132
I have something to say.

166
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,718
<i>Well, can't it wait until you get home?</i>

167
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,637
I won't be home.

168
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:44,807
<i>What's happened?</i>

169
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,935
Will you just...
Will you get to the phone upstairs?

170
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,728
<i>What's happened?</i>

171
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:55,693
Just go to the phone in the bedroom
and I'll tell you what's happened.

172
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,070
<i>Okay-</i>

173
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,947
<i>Sean, when I shout,
put the phone down, please.</i>

174
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:01,949
<i>- Hey, Dad, are you coming back?
- Eddie.</i>

175
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,826
Yeah, I'm talking to your mother.

176
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,079
<i>He hasn't put any wingers on
and he's put Caldwell back on again.</i>

177
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,247
<i>Hello?</i>

178
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,082
Eddie, will you put the phone down, please?

179
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,709
<i>Dad, I can't believe the team he's picked.</i>

180
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,752
Eddie, please,
can you put the phone down, please?

181
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,296
<i>Eddie.</i>

182
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,175
<i>So, go on, tell me. What is it?</i>

183
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,849
Last year, this job...
You know, the job in Croydon.

184
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,352
Do you remember? I was up and down there
for three months. Remember?

185
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,895
<i>Yes.</i>

186
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,317
I stayed in the guesthouse,
the one that had...

187
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,526
It had bad damp, I said.

188
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,153
Remember? The...

189
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,156
<i>Yeah.</i>

190
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,407
They gave me an assistant.

191
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,035
She worked with me
on the block construction.

192
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,663
- She?
- She was a secretary, quite old.

193
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,541
We... We worked together.

194
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,212
She's quite old and she lives on her own.

195
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,922
She's 43 or something.

196
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,549
She's...

197
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,635
<i>Why are you telling me about some woman?</i>

198
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:10,225
This is the only time I ever did this, Katrina.
The only time.

199
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,231
Look, after the block was settled in,
there were some drinks to celebrate.

200
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,569
Now, the block going in is a big thing
because it's the base of a whole building.

201
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,738
And she came back to the guesthouse.

202
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,909
She isn't what you would call
an oil painting,

203
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,912
but it was wet and cold,
and she talked about being lonely

204
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,580
and I talked about being happy.

205
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:35,959
But I'm lonely sometimes, you know,
when I was away, and...

206
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,505
And there was this wine and...

207
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,303
This was the only time I did this
in all our 15 years.

208
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:52,101
And now tonight she's giving birth.

209
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,187
Tonight she's giving birth and it's mine.

210
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,335
Ivan Locke.

211
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,963
<i>Yeah, it's Gareth, Ivan. I just spoke to Donal.</i>

212
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,965
<i>This had better be more than good!</i>

213
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,508
Hello, Gareth.

214
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,970
<i>Speak to me only
about tomorrow morning, Ivan.</i>

215
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,138
Right, well...

216
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,933
I won't be on site for the pump tomorrow.

217
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,188
<i>Sweet monkey Jesus! This is not happening.</i>

218
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,568
The truth is,
tonight I'm going to become a father.

219
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,823
And she's in London, so I have to be there.

220
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:31,408
<i>Okay, Okay-</i>

221
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,162
<i>Jesus!
I'm just gonna read you something, Ivan.</i>

222
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,289
<i>- Are you listening?
- Yes.</i>

223
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,541
<i>"Good luck tomorrow with the pour.</i>

224
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,752
<i>"We just had it confirmed by CGO</i>

225
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,588
<i>"that this will be
the biggest single concrete pour</i>

226
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:48,217
<i>"ever made in Europe
outside of nuclear military projects.</i>

227
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:52,638
<i>"I know the day is in the safest of hands.
Best wishes, Mitchell."</i>

228
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,768
<i>That is Mitchell Dean himself,
the president of the whole fucking company.</i>

229
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:01,104
<i>Did you hear that, Ivan? From Chicago, USA.</i>

230
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,108
Yes.

231
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,944
<i>You're gonna have to speak up, Ivan.
I can't hear you.</i>

232
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,445
Yes, I heard.

233
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,615
<i>And so, you're the man in charge
of the entire operation,</i>

234
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,493
<i>but with 10 hours to go,
you've decided you ain't gonna be there!</i>

235
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:17,496
Well, Donal will handle it
and he's a good man.

236
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,998
<i>Don't you fucking dare say that to me!</i>

237
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,127
<i>Don't you fucking dare
give qualitative appraisals on my staff</i>

238
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:28,090
<i>and say "good man," like he's going off
to buy a fucking ice cream!</i>

239
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,260
<i>Jesus, this is fucking concrete.</i>

240
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:36,473
<i>Like shit, Ivan. Like piss.
When it comes, you pump it.</i>

241
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,017
Like babies.

242
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,645
<i>Shit. This is a joke to you.</i>

243
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,691
No, no.
Right now nothing is a joke anymore.

244
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,694
<i>Oh, God!</i>

245
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:53,115
<i>And so, it's not your wife giving birth?</i>

246
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,033
No.

247
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,827
- Jesus!
- lt's someone else.

248
00:17:56,952 --> 00:18:00,080
<i>Ivan! You're the last person on earth...</i>

249
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:04,459
Yes, I know, I am the last person on earth,
but it happened.

250
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:08,005
<i>And this woman, she can't just...
She can't give birth on her own?</i>

251
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,214
I have made a decision.

252
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,300
There is nobody else
who could be with her, okay?

253
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:15,345
She has no friends in London
and is quite a fragile person.

254
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,223
<i>Fragile!</i>

255
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,684
<i>You're gonna abandon
the biggest fucking concrete pour in Europe</i>

256
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,978
<i>to hold someone's fucking hand
because she's fragile?</i>

257
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,856
And because the baby was caused by me.

258
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,359
That is my decision I have made.

259
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:33,071
I have not behaved in the right way
with this woman at all.

260
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,783
I have behaved in a way that isn't like me.

261
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,328
But now I am going to do the right thing.

262
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,496
<i>What, and Chicago can go to fucking hell?</i>

263
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:45,876
It is a decision that I have made.
I'm not gonna turn back.

264
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:50,005
<i>Do you know how many millions of pounds
are riding on tomorrow?</i>

265
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,509
<i>If any one of those pumps fucks up, Ivan,</i>

266
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,888
<i>we are facing 10 million pounds
worth of losses in 15 minutes.</i>

267
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,182
<i>So if we get that 15 minutes
for the whole morning,</i>

268
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,558
<i>a total shutdown,</i>

269
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,727
<i>$100 million.</i>

270
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,901
<i>- Are you still there, Ivan?
- Mes, yes.</i>

271
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,072
Look, I have no explanation.

272
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,199
Apart from the one that I've given you.

273
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,825
But, Gareth, listen...

274
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:24,373
I have made a pledge to myself
that I will not allow the pour to fuck up.

275
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,792
<i>This is a joke!</i>

276
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,753
<i>Are you wearing a fucking red nose?</i>

277
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,215
<i>This is a fucking joke, Ivan.</i>

278
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,135
<i>I'm gonna call Chicago, right?</i>

279
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,055
<i>If it weren't for the fact that you've been
so solid for us for so many years,</i>

280
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,890
<i>I'd fire you down the phone.</i>

281
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,818
<i>Ivan, have you lost your fucking mind?</i>

282
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,737
I have made my decision.

283
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,926
What the fuck are you looking at?

284
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,431
You're laughing, aren't you?

285
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,766
Laughing at my predicament.

286
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:30,397
It's a familiar predicament
to a man like you, isn't it, Dad, eh?

287
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,942
You think, "There he is, look.
Like father, like son.

288
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:38,280
"There's the man I made."
What is it they say?

289
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,533
"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."

290
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,077
Well, that's where you're wrong.

291
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:47,539
Listen to me,
you fucking piece of worthless shit.

292
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,624
I want you to watch.

293
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,545
Do you know, in fact,
I would like to take a fucking shovel

294
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,424
and dig you up out of the fucking ground
and make you watch me tonight.

295
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,134
I would pull open your eyes

296
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,887
and kick the mud and worms and shit
out of your fucking ears

297
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,055
just for the duration of this journey.

298
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:08,602
Because it's me driving. Me, not you.

299
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:12,230
And, unlike you, I will drive
straight to the place where I should be,

300
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,108
and I will be there to take care of my...

301
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,279
To take care of my fuck-up.

302
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,593
Yes, Donal.

303
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,554
<i>Okay, okay, I'm driving back now
so I'm gonna be quick.</i>

304
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:48,517
<i>I called Ryan
and I got half a dozen Poles off him,</i>

305
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,186
<i>and I got some Hungarians from Patrick.</i>

306
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:55,065
<i>I've got breakfast tickets
for the concrete farmers,</i>

307
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,860
<i>and the shutter boys are done,
apart from the fucking-about with the clips.</i>

308
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,655
<i>I've asked Albanian Alby
to test the pumps on the Argyll side,</i>

309
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,198
<i>and he said that they're pissing it out.</i>

310
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,158
No, listen... Okay, stop, stop, stop.

311
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,787
Listen, when you get back on site,
you check every pump yourself,

312
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,915
individually and
with your own hand on the turner.

313
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,959
You don't ask anybody else
to check and sign off.

314
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:18,338
You go around the whole site
and you check each one yourself.

315
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:23,385
And you don't trust Alby after 5:00
because he drinks, okay?

316
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,264
<i>- Okay, okay.</i>
- Now, will you talk to me about the mix?

317
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:31,226
<i>The mix... Yeah, the mix. Did we say C6?</i>

318
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,854
Don't say that like it's a question.

319
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:34,980
<i>Okay, yes, okay.</i>

320
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,983
<i>Sometimes I say things and it sounds
like a question and it's not a question.</i>

321
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,695
Well, all the mixes for the pump will be C6.
Why do you even ask?

322
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,238
- It's written on the whiteboard...
- I'm not asking.

323
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:47,367
...in fucking giant letters. I put "C6"
all over the cabin in big red letters.

324
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,244
- Slump of one inch, C6.
- Okay.

325
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,121
Don't ask me questions like that.

326
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:54,624
<i>I'm not asking a question.
I know you don't like questions.</i>

327
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,251
<i>Fucking hell!</i>

328
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,628
All right, what time are you unlocking?

329
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,255
<i>I don't know. I'm gonna sleep here tonight.</i>

330
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,049
Good, good, except you don't sleep, okay?
Check everything.

331
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,509
You've got the client sign-off?

332
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,469
<i>Yeah, yeah,
and the client sign-off on the gates.</i>

333
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,513
That's what I mean, the gate sign-off.

334
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,641
Donal, the construction sign-off
should already be filed.

335
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:15,937
<i>Yes, it is. It's already... It's already filed,
it's okay. That's what I meant.</i>

336
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,316
Okay, right. Well, you have
the phone numbers of the plants, don't you?

337
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,692
- Yeah.
- Call them now, Donal.

338
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,653
Call every one of those bastards,
get them to repeat the order.

339
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:27,616
C6 on the nose
or we send those trucks back.

340
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,242
Seriously, those fuckers will fuck you up

341
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,494
with the water in the gullies
if it rains tomorrow.

342
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,039
<i>Well, it's not gonna rain tomorrow.
It's gonna be dry.</i>

343
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,209
<i>I've got a direct line to God
up in heaven, you know.</i>

344
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:43,673
Donal, you don't trust God
when it comes to concrete.

345
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,134
You call the plants, Donal,

346
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,469
<i>- every one of them.
- I will, okay.</i>

347
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,387
And get them to fax the order back
so you can check it.

348
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,681
<i>I will. I'll do that. I'll do that now.
Did you speak to Gareth?</i>

349
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:55,018
Yes, I did, actually. He's calling Chicago.

350
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:59,230
I'm guessing Chicago's going to fire me
and he'll put some fucking kid on it, so...

351
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,982
- No, no, no.
- Don't take his calls.

352
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,108
Just don't take his calls.

353
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,194
<i>- Don't listen to</i> anybody else.
<i>- I can't not take his calls.</i>

354
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,405
Don't take his calls. Don't listen to
anybody else until the morning.

355
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,282
This is me and you, okay?

356
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,159
<i>So, I'm not gonna answer his calls?</i>

357
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:14,162
No. Just me and you till the morning, okay?

358
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,581
- Okay.
- Cool.

359
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,166
<i>Fucking hell, okay.</i>

360
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:38,436
<i>Hello. This is Bethan.
I'm afraid I can't get to the phone.</i>

361
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,908
<i>- Did you call?
- Are you</i> okay?

362
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:54,703
<i>Yeah. Someone closed the windows.</i>

363
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,621
Did you talk to anyone about the pain?

364
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:59,916
<i>- No, no one's been in.
- But is everything</i> all <i>right?</i>

365
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:03,211
<i>No. It hurts like nothing ever.</i>

366
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,922
Okay, well, I'm on the M6.

367
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:08,925
An hour and a quarter
if the traffic stays okay.

368
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,552
You must speak to someone about the pain.

369
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,346
<i>Just then I felt like I hate you.</i>

370
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,099
Well, we don't know each other, Bethan.
That's the simple truth.

371
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:18,768
- This thing just happened.
- Thing?

372
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,062
So we can't really love each other
or hate each other, can we?

373
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,857
This thing just happened and that's it.

374
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:27,861
And it will go up and down, I suppose,
but at least I'm coming, okay?

375
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:31,031
<i>Do you...
Do you hate me for going through with it?</i>

376
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:35,201
I don't know you, so...
I don't hate you, do I? I mean...

377
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,204
I don't know you, so...

378
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:42,667
Look, do what they tell you to do.
I have a lot of calls to make.

379
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,628
The traffic is fine so it'll be okay.

380
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,965
- Please <i>be quick.</i>
- Yes, but there's a speed limit.

381
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,616
<i>- Hello, Gareth.
- Yeah, look.</i>

382
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:18,912
<i>Chicago is having a predictable meltdown.</i>

383
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,456
ls it? Okay.

384
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:25,960
<i>Yeah, I gave them...
I gave them the whole 10-year thing</i>

385
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:29,297
<i>about your 10 years working for Park
without a foot wrong.</i>

386
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,132
9 years. I've been with you 9 years.

387
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,468
- What?
- 9 years.

388
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:37,764
<i>Yeah, the whole thing, Ivan.
He said he goes on emotion.</i>

389
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,642
<i>He said the stuff about
the biggest pour in Europe.</i>

390
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,770
Outside the nuclear and military,
I know, I know.

391
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:50,110
<i>Well, I'll tell you what, lvan...
You're fired, is what it ls.</i>

392
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:54,989
<i>They said they had no choice.
I said... I told them about the 10 years.</i>

393
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,783
<i>- 9 years.
- But they said they had no choice.</i>

394
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:59,035
<i>Yeah. 9, 10, whatever.</i>

395
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,706
So it's okay. It's okay.

396
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:09,879
<i>- I never do this on the phone, Ivan.
- lt's okay. It's okay.</i>

397
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,925
I will still make sure the pour is all right.

398
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,304
<i>No, Ivan, it's...
It's not a matter for negotiation.</i>

399
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,599
<i>They've decided you're fired, completely,
as of right this second.</i>

400
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,561
I know, I heard you,
and I don't blame them, okay?

401
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,438
But I'm not trying to keep my job. I just...

402
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:30,066
I just want the pour to go okay tomorrow.

403
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:32,193
- Ivan...
- Listen to me. You listen to me.

404
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,280
I want the pour to go okay,
not because of the money.

405
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,324
I want it to go right for myself
and for the building.

406
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,243
Right? And for the concrete.

407
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,620
I won't let it be pumped
into the wrong place. Do you understand?

408
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,456
Tonight and tomorrow,
I will stay on this and stay on this

409
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:47,500
and make sure
the concrete gets poured right.

410
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,461
<i>Ivan, listen, I told them about the 10 years.</i>

411
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:52,005
- Fuck your <i>10 years.
- They weren't 't having any of it.</i>

412
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,715
Listen to me, Gareth... Listen, Gareth.

413
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,302
The concrete will come
and I will take care of it, okay?

414
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,346
I know I don't have a job anymore,
but I will do this anyway

415
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:04,726
as a favor to the building
and to the concrete.

416
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:11,024
<i>- Ivan, you sound different.
- I am the same.</i>

417
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:16,529
<i>Why didn't you just say you were sick?</i>

418
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:20,658
Because I'm not sick,
and I'll make sure the pour is okay.

419
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:24,996
<i>Yeah, but I've already handed it over
to another construction director.</i>

420
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,749
<i>Ivan, he's gonna pick it up from...</i>

421
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,639
Katrina?

422
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,642
<i>That didn't happen. I'm not believing it.</i>

423
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,815
Katrina, I want to move
to a practical next step.

424
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:57,528
<i>I'm here in the dark in our bedroom and...
Oh, God, nothing looks the same.</i>

425
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:02,825
<i>Ivan?</i>

426
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:07,121
I can't... I can't speak very well. I...

427
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,336
I have felt scraped-out for months.

428
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:19,384
She phoned and said
that she was having a baby

429
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:24,764
and keeping it because
it was her last chance to be happy.

430
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:29,018
And then tonight she phoned and said
the waters broke and it's 2 months early.

431
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:33,398
I was... I was going to tell you before,
but the waters broke early,

432
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,442
so I have to do this now in the car.

433
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:42,115
- Every night I was going to tell you.
<i>-God, I can't...</i>

434
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,575
<i>I can't really breathe.</i>

435
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:49,289
Katrina, listen. You know
what happened with my dad, right?

436
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,249
And how that bastard wasn't around for me.

437
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,626
<i>- Didn't even give me a fucking name.
- No, no, you're confused.</i>

438
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:56,462
<i>Ivan, it's you that's the bastard.</i>

439
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,256
<i>It's the baby that's the bastard.</i>

440
00:29:58,339 --> 00:29:59,841
<i>For God's sake, Ivan,
at least get the word right.</i>

441
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:00,967
Katrina, listen.

442
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:05,555
No, I will give the baby my name
and it will see my face.

443
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,808
It will know and
it won't spend its life thinking...

444
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,101
You know, thinking that nobody...

445
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:15,023
<i>I've closed the door and I'm in the dark,
and I'm almost sure this isn't you.</i>

446
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,816
<i>Please don't be you.</i>

447
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:19,193
I know, I should have said all this
a long time ago.

448
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,361
I'm so...

449
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:23,364
I have behaved not at all like myself.

450
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:27,243
<i>- I suppose I gotta get up.
- Katrina, please, don't go.</i>

451
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:29,412
<i>- I have to throw up again.
- Please, don't...</i>

452
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:51,476
<i>- Donal?
- Okay. Ivan?</i>

453
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,896
<i>This isn't a question.
This isn't a question, okay?</i>

454
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,232
<i>But I just got off the phone
with the plant in Stafford,</i>

455
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,568
<i>and they said they know that it's a C6 mix,</i>

456
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,571
<i>but how far towards C5 can it go?</i>

457
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,784
<i>In other words, if one truck had some C5,</i>

458
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,286
<i>how bad would that be taken?</i>

459
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,084
<i>Are you still there?</i>

460
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,923
Donal, what does it say on the whiteboard?

461
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,218
<i>On the... It says C6.</i>

462
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,221
What does it say on every piece of
paperwork and on every sign-off sheet?

463
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,765
<i>- It says C6.
- It says C6.</i>

464
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,518
And you know why?

465
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:39,107
Because, eventually, when my building
is complete, it will be 55 floors high.

466
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:43,945
It will weigh 2,223,000 metric tons.

467
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,115
Okay? My building will alter the water table
and squeeze granite.

468
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:50,410
It will be visible from 20 miles away.

469
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:53,454
At sunset, it will cast a shadow
probably a mile long.

470
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:58,459
Now, if the concrete
at the base of my building is not right,

471
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:02,630
if it slips half an inch, cracks appear.

472
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:06,134
Right? If cracks appear,
then they will grow and grow, won't they?

473
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,469
- And the whole thing will collapse.
- Ivan, <i>look...</i>

474
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:12,723
You make one mistake, Donal,
one little fucking mistake,

475
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,934
and the whole world
comes crashing down around you.

476
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:19,564
Do you understand?
So you tell Stafford, C6.

477
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,607
<i>- C6 it is.
- Thank you.</i>

478
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:33,286
- Kat, please, listen.
- Hey, Dad.

479
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,954
<i>- What?
- Yeah, we 're 1-nil down.</i>

480
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,248
ls your mother there?

481
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,499
<i>Damn.</i>

482
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,001
<i>Mum.</i>

483
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,003
<i>- Sean, will you go and get Mum?
- I'm watching the match.</i>

484
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,130
<i>Stupid penalty.
Are you listening on the radio?</i>

485
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,840
<i>- ls that Dad?
- No. No.</i>

486
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,091
<i>Tell him they've scored.</i>

487
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:49,635
<i>Dad, she's on the toilet, I think.</i>

488
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:54,765
- Eddie...
- Yeah?

489
00:32:58,186 --> 00:32:59,687
- What?
- lt's okay. Don't worry about it.

490
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:03,774
It's fine. Listen, I'll talk to you
when it all settles down, okay?

491
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:04,859
<i>- All right.
- Okay.</i>

492
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:07,528
<i>- Cool. Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Eddie. Bye-bye.</i>

493
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,059
Ivan Locke.

494
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:42,563
<i>Hello, this is Sister Margaret
from St. Mary's maternity unit.</i>

495
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,148
ls everything okay?

496
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:47,401
<i>I'm with Bethan Maguire. ls it your partner?</i>

497
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:49,987
I am the father.

498
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,614
<i>She's quite distressed,</i>

499
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,575
<i>and we were wondering if someone
was gonna be with her for the birth.</i>

500
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,662
<i>She said she doesn't have anyone else.</i>

501
00:33:57,745 --> 00:34:00,915
Yes. I'm an hour away, I think,
if the traffic's okay.

502
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,375
Is she all right?

503
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,670
<i>- Well, there's a complication.
- What is the complication?</i>

504
00:34:05,753 --> 00:34:08,339
<i>It's a complication with the umbilical cord,</i>

505
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:13,386
<i>and it means there will be a procedure,
and it would help if Dad was around.</i>

506
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,429
- You are Dad?
- Yes, yes, I am.

507
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,392
I'm driving. I'm doing 90.

508
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,688
<i>Well, please don't
drive dangerously or anything.</i>

509
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:27,733
I won't. Listen, I will be there very shortly.

510
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,404
<i>Good. Okay, well, she's with the consultant
at the moment.</i>

511
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,781
<i>I just wanted to make sure
someone was coming.</i>

512
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,117
Yes, Well, IWill, I'll be there.

513
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:40,621
<i>Good. So what you need to do
is use the emergency entrance</i>

514
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:44,125
- and ask for Bailey Ward.
- Bailey? Okay, I will do.

515
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,502
<i>She's very emotional.</i>

516
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,462
Well, she isn't used
to being emotional, I think.

517
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:50,798
I think she's normally a very quiet person.

518
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:55,469
<i>- You are her partner?
- I am the father.</i>

519
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,931
I don't...

520
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:03,477
I don't know her too well,
if you want the truth. But I'm coming.

521
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:07,648
<i>- She's very afraid.
- I understand that.</i>

522
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:09,984
I'm driving.

523
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,500
Yes, Donal.

524
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:30,004
<i>Right, I've checked all the 12 pumps myself
and they're all pissing it out.</i>

525
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:34,008
<i>- Good. You are testing with C6?
-Yes, yeah, I see only C6.</i>

526
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,969
- And you called all the plants?
- Yeah, I called all the plants.

527
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:39,513
<i>And just so you know,
they all gave me dog's abuse for checking.</i>

528
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,849
Excellent, and they have the trucks lined up
and the mix is in?

529
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:46,937
<i>Yes, yeah, yeah. I ticked off each response
after all the fuck-yous and piss-offs,</i>

530
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:53,444
- and it came to 6,500 cubic meters.
- Okay. What about the retardant?

531
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:56,030
<i>The retardant's on site already,
ready to go into the trucks.</i>

532
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:59,533
- Good. Now, do you have a pen?
- I have a pencil.

533
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,370
Well, get a pen.

534
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,330
<i>Okay, I have a pen.</i>

535
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:07,708
Good. Now, in the top right-hand drawer

536
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,961
above the blow-heater, you'll find my folder.

537
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:14,340
Get it. It's going to be your bible tonight.

538
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:15,966
<i>Okay-</i>

539
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,679
- I don't see any folder.
- Yes, no, it's there. It's there.

540
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:22,056
Okay? It's got everything
that you're going to need in there.

541
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,850
Right? All the numbers,
the sign-offs, the road closures

542
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,477
that you have to confirm with the police.

543
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,896
Now, it's in the drawer
above the blow-heater.

544
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:31,691
<i>Well, the blow-heater was taken
by the fucking Hungarians.</i>

545
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:33,317
<i>You'd think they'd be used to the cold,
wouldn't you?</i>

546
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,569
Donal, you do know
which drawer that I mean, right?

547
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,238
<i>It's not here. I've checked all the drawers.</i>

548
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,572
Well, it is...

549
00:36:39,699 --> 00:36:40,950
Fuck.

550
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,869
<i>What? What?</i>

551
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,497
- Fuck off.
- What? Me?

552
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,916
No, not you. I have it here. Shit!

553
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:53,129
All the things you are going to need,
and I have it fucking here in my car.

554
00:36:56,841 --> 00:36:58,926
<i>Well, I've never...</i>

555
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,886
<i>You know, Ivan,
in all the 10 years I've known you,</i>

556
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:04,098
<i>I've never...
I've never known you to fuck up like this.</i>

557
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,766
<i>What the fuck's going on?</i>

558
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:07,435
Okay, Donal...

559
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:10,604
Will you just give me some time to think?

560
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,607
Fuck!

561
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,088
Are you okay?

562
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:38,174
<i>Okay? Okay?</i>

563
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,050
Kat, please. Just hear what I want to say...

564
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,887
<i>Of all the things in the world,
I never thought of you doing this!</i>

565
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,806
<i>- Katrina, don't let the boys hear.
- You fucked some girl.</i>

566
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,684
<i>- Quietly, quietly.
- You fucked her and then me.</i>

567
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:50,144
<i>I looked at my diary and I checked.</i>

568
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,146
<i>I remember when you got home
from Croydon that weekend,</i>

569
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,106
<i>and you had a big stupid grin on your face.</i>

570
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,649
The block was in. I was happy with it.

571
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:58,986
<i>- And I sit in the dark.
- It was once.</i>

572
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,404
<i>Once!</i>

573
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,157
<i>The difference between once and never
is the whole world.</i>

574
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:06,994
<i>The difference between never and once
is the difference between good and bad.</i>

575
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:09,622
- I know that.
- You don't know.

576
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,332
- I know.
- No, you don't know anything.

577
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,833
I know.

578
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,669
<i>Yeah, yeah, no.
You had a big stupid grin that night.</i>

579
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:18,464
It was work. The block was down.

580
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:21,509
- You <i>fucked</i> someone.
- It was an odd night.

581
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:24,345
There wasn't really a bad thought
in anybody's head.

582
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,848
<i>- You had a big fucking grin.
- That isn't it.</i>

583
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,725
<i>Yeah, like you'd won something.</i>

584
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,478
<i>I remember you smiling
and putting your coat on the stairs.</i>

585
00:38:32,603 --> 00:38:34,355
<i>I thought you'd won something.</i>

586
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,857
I was trying to be normal.

587
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,861
I can't remember. Look, the block was in.

588
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:44,490
<i>And that stuff about the baby.
You think she's having a baby?</i>

589
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:48,118
Yes, she's having the baby tonight.

590
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:49,203
<i>Is she?</i>

591
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,416
<i>Forget that. You're a clown.</i>

592
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,212
<i>Forget that. You're a stupid clown.</i>

593
00:38:58,379 --> 00:38:59,630
<i>You think it's yours?</i>

594
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,882
<i>Why would it be yours
if she fucks everybody?</i>

595
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,384
She doesn't.

596
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,970
<i>If she fucks you, she fucks everybody.</i>

597
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:09,640
She isn't like that.
She had given up on having anything.

598
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:16,981
<i>I can't believe it's me and you
and we're talking about somebody else.</i>

599
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,194
<i>Like somebody broke into the house. I just...</i>

600
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:27,449
<i>I can't...</i>

601
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:30,786
I want to talk about a practical next step.

602
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,417
<i>Did you say she's not like that?</i>

603
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:38,586
<i>You were with her one night
and you know her?</i>

604
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:40,546
<i>You have a call waiting.</i>

605
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:44,258
She doesn't do that. She hadn't for years.

606
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,594
Okay? Afterwards she was sad.

607
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,514
<i>Did you say sad?</i>

608
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:03,944
<i>- Mes'?
- I think we got out off.</i>

609
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,114
Shit. Okay, yes. I have the file here.

610
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,285
Hang on a second.

611
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:16,415
Okay, I have the file here.

612
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,875
- Right.
- I'm going to have to give you

613
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,294
some information over the phone,

614
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,922
and you're going
to have to write it down, okay?

615
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:24,673
<i>Okay-</i>

616
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:27,801
Donal, are you drinking something?
What are you drinking?

617
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:32,014
<i>A nice bottle of fizzy pop.</i>

618
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:38,437
Okay, I need you to call the duty officer
at Belmount Police Station

619
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:42,066
and confirm some road closures
for the morning, okay?

620
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,276
Do you still have the pen?

621
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:47,613
- Yeah.
- Right, okay.

622
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:50,783
Here are the roads
we agreed with the council

623
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,870
that need to be closed to traffic
for the duration of the pour,

624
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:58,374
which is from 5:25 a.m. to midday.

625
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,668
<i>Yeah, okay, go.</i>

626
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:05,839
Crescent Road between Arch Green
and Claremount.

627
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:07,591
<i>Crescent Road between Arch Green
and Claremount.</i>

628
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:12,346
<i>- Planetree Road at the south end only.
- Planetree Road at the south end only, yeah.</i>

629
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:16,183
The Vale up to Parklands Farm Road.

630
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,852
<i>- Okay, yeah.</i>
- But with the stop-go operated by us.

631
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,020
<i>Yeah, got that.</i>

632
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:23,023
You'll need to quote
the license number 750...

633
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,819
- 750.
- ...slash DV. Okay?

634
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,279
<i>Slash DV. Cool. Okay. Got it.</i>

635
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:33,200
Good. Donal?
It is fizzy pop that you're drinking, yes?

636
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,868
<i>It is. It is.</i>

637
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:39,039
Because if you are on the fucking cider
and I find out,

638
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,875
I will cut your legs off
with a fucking pavement saw.

639
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:45,045
<i>Will you? Right.
Now, lvan... lvan, listen to me.</i>

640
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:47,214
<i>There's no need
for you to talk to me like that, okay?</i>

641
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:50,134
<i>Because I've got 6 calls here
that I'm looking at</i>

642
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,803
<i>stacked up on this phone from Gareth,
and I'm guessing what they are</i>

643
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,555
<i>and what he's saying to me
on the phone calls.</i>

644
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,807
<i>But I agreed that I'm not gonna take
those phone calls from Gareth</i>

645
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,686
<i>because I'm fucking shitting my pants here,
you know, about tomorrow going pear,</i>

646
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:03,689
<i>and I don't want him to give me
some fucking college kid on the phone</i>

647
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:05,399
<i>trying to talk me through this from scratch.</i>

648
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:08,152
<i>So, as far as I'm concerned,
until the sun comes up,</i>

649
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,029
<i>yours is the only voice I'm gonna listen to.</i>

650
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:12,865
<i>But hear this, don't fucking threaten me!</i>

651
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:13,949
<i>- Okay?
- You have a call waiting.</i>

652
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,910
<i>You have no official position now
to threaten me from,</i>

653
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:19,413
<i>so don't fucking threaten me!</i>

654
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:23,375
So it is cider that you're drinking?

655
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:28,255
<i>One can of cider, yeah! So fucking what?</i>

656
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,257
Eat something.

657
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:34,887
<i>Do you know what?
I'm not actually that hungry at the moment.</i>

658
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,893
<i>Okay, now let me get these calls
to these fucking coppers</i>

659
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,019
<i>and confirm the road closures,</i>

660
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,937
<i>and then I'll call you back
for further instructions.</i>

661
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:45,856
<i>Over and fucking out.</i>

662
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:54,490
Fuck!

663
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:03,457
Right.

664
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:05,292
Ivan Locke.

665
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,961
<i>They say there's a twist.</i>

666
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:10,214
A what?

667
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:14,426
<i>It's round the baby's neck like a noose.</i>

668
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,430
Well, you're in the best place.
Honestly, you are. You're in the best place.

669
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:21,642
<i>They let me use my phone for one minute.</i>

670
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:31,110
<i>- When will you get here?
- About 45 minutes.</i>

671
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:35,614
I'm outside Northampton.
The traffic is okay.

672
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:38,992
<i>It's like waiting for God, or...
Waiting for Godot.</i>

673
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:43,747
<i>Sorry, you're not a theater man.</i>

674
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:46,917
<i>And not a reader of books and not a talker.</i>

675
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,336
<i>A builder. Funny, isn't it?</i>

676
00:43:51,547 --> 00:43:54,299
<i>It's funny it was someone like you,
someone so opposite to me.</i>

677
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:57,928
<i>All the things I love
mean absolutely zero to you.</i>

678
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:02,015
The important thing is to get the baby out.

679
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:06,687
<i>Well, the news is,
they're resorting to knives.</i>

680
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,191
Well, by the sound of you,
they're giving you gas, are they?

681
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:15,112
<i>Yeah, they think
they might have to cut me open</i>

682
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,698
<i>because I'm too old to push.</i>

683
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:21,493
That's okay, that's okay.
They do that as a routine. lt's okay.

684
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:23,745
It's better, in fact.

685
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:26,081
<i>"In fact"? ls that so?</i>

686
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:29,001
Yes. The traffic is okay.

687
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:31,545
<i>They're taking blood.</i>

688
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:33,130
Well, just do what they say.

689
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:36,550
<i>And someone keeps opening the window.</i>

690
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:38,552
Tell them you're cold.

691
00:44:39,553 --> 00:44:43,307
<i>They talk around me.
I need someone here to speak for me.</i>

692
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,102
<i>They said the umbilical cord is like a noose.</i>

693
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:51,398
<i>A lifeline and a noose at the same time.
It's funny, isn't it?</i>

694
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,609
Bethan... Bethan...

695
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:57,196
Bethan?

696
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,407
Jesus.

697
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:05,329
You think this is all fate, don't you, Dad?

698
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:10,250
Your dirty fucking fingerprints all over me.

699
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:14,546
You thought it was bound to happen
because of the little seeds that you planted.

700
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,423
Okay, well, let me educate you.

701
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:21,929
Even no matter what the situation is,
you can make it good,

702
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:25,265
like with plaster and brick.

703
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:30,604
You never knew that because you never
lifted a finger, you fucking lazy cunt.

704
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:32,439
But you know what?
You can take a situation

705
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:34,274
and you can draw a circle around it

706
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,443
and find a way to work something out.

707
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,779
You don't just drive away from it.

708
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:42,741
No. Or sit in the corner of some
greasy little fucking pub somewhere

709
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:45,953
like you're the fucking happy little maverick.

710
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,122
<i>L could come for you
with a pick and a shovel, I really could,</i>

711
00:45:49,248 --> 00:45:52,251
<i>and dig you up
and it would be a happy day in hell</i>

712
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:55,295
<i>because they would be rid of you for a bit.</i>

713
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,673
<i>You know what?
I could just drive around the M25</i>

714
00:45:57,798 --> 00:46:00,467
<i>and head to Dover or some-fucking-where
and not face it, couldn't I?</i>

715
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:04,930
<i>Just earn good money, cash in hand,
working on the Crossrail.</i>

716
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,975
<i>They make 500 a day just shoveling shit,</i>

717
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,977
<i>shoveling shit about like you.</i>

718
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:15,274
No, I'm going to drive
straight to the worst place for me,

719
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:20,862
the worst place on earth for me to be,
even though this woman is like...

720
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:27,202
She's, like, sad and lonely,
hardly bothered with life at all.

721
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,455
I felt sorry for her, you know?

722
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,582
I felt sorry for her.

723
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:37,296
So, how can that be the difference
between good and bad?

724
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,481
<i>Yeah!</i>

725
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,026
<i>Yeah, that was wicked!
Dad, are you listening to this?</i>

726
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,528
<i>2-1 to us. Two goals in 3 minutes.</i>

727
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,697
<i>Dad, seriously, you gotta put it on the radio.
It's brilliant.</i>

728
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:07,743
<i>- ls your mother there?
- No, she's upstairs on the toilet.</i>

729
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,161
<i>She's been in there ages.</i>

730
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:11,121
<i>She's wearing the shirt,
but she won't come down.</i>

731
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:12,247
<i>Do you want me to call her?</i>

732
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:18,462
No, no, just leave her. It's okay.

733
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,255
Go on, you enjoy the game.

734
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,717
<i>2-1. We're winning.
Dad, why aren't you going mad?</i>

735
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:29,348
I am, Eddie, I'm going mad inside.

736
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:31,892
But I'm driving and I'm...

737
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,918
Come on.

738
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:05,425
Please.

739
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,722
Answer the phone. Please, please, please.

740
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:13,934
<i>- Duty desk.
- Hello. PC Davids?</i>

741
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,227
<i>- Speaking.
- Mes.</i>

742
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,771
It's Ivan Locke from the Park project.

743
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:21,775
I was wondering if anyone had
called you about road closures.

744
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:25,320
<i>Yeah, we had some Irish guy.
Said he was standing in.</i>

745
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:29,699
Good, yes. I'm just double-checking
the closures are all confirmed, yes?

746
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,785
<i>One minute.</i>

747
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,747
<i>No, there's... There's a problem</i>

748
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:37,499
<i>- with the Vale stop and go.</i>
- What?

749
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,876
<i>There's a problem with the Vale stop and go.</i>

750
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,961
Shit!

751
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:43,255
<i>The council, they've questioned
the license at the last minute.</i>

752
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,714
<i>- Shit.
- So...</i>

753
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:46,466
<i>I was gonna call them in the morning.</i>

754
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,136
- Well, it's too late.
- I'm sorry?

755
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:53,140
We have to control the road to get
the trucks in and out of the south gate.

756
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:55,100
<i>Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Locke.</i>

757
00:48:55,225 --> 00:48:57,227
<i>You'll have to take that up with the council.</i>

758
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,479
- But it's 9:00.
- Yeah.

759
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,982
Well, the council offices
are closed, aren't they?

760
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:07,362
<i>That's right, but I can't ratify until
the council sign off on the stop and go.</i>

761
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,489
Okay, no, I understand. Okay, I understand.

762
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:11,324
You'll get a call.
How long are you on duty for?

763
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:12,492
<i>You have a call waiting.</i>

764
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,661
<i>Well, you've got another 25 minutes.</i>

765
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:18,248
Okay, look, you'll get a call, okay?
You'll get a call.

766
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:25,005
<i>Ivan, we have a problem
with the stop and go.</i>

767
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,673
I know, I just heard. I'm dealing with it.

768
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,968
In the meantime, I need you
to go and check the shuttering

769
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,386
and get it signed off.

770
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,597
<i>No, the shuttering boys have all gone home.</i>

771
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:36,808
Even so, you still have to go
and check the rebars, don't you?

772
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:39,311
Go and do it now. Take a shovel

773
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:42,022
and a pressure meter and a torch
and get into the holes.

774
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,982
<i>- Jesus. Jesus.
- I mean it.</i>

775
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:48,403
<i>Okay, but if this is just to stop me drinking,
you can fuck right off.</i>

776
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:52,032
Listen, I'm hoping
your conscience will stop you drinking.

777
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:56,203
The shuttering has to be checked.
Go... Go and do it. Go.

778
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:08,256
<i>- Hello?
- Sean, it's Dad.</i>

779
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:12,052
<i>Dad, I can't believe you're not here.
It's amazing. 2-1.</i>

780
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:14,221
I know, I know. Sean...

781
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:16,973
Sorry.

782
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:18,808
Sean, I need you to do me a favor.

783
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:21,394
<i>- There's...
- You have a call waiting.</i>

784
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,730
There's been a cock-up at work
and I need to speak to someone.

785
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:27,359
In my blue coat in the kitchen, yes?
There's a notebook.

786
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,653
There's a phone number in the notebook
of somebody called Cassidy

787
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:33,406
who works for the council clerk of works.
I need the number.

788
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:36,243
- Why don't you ask Mum?
- Please... Sean, please.

789
00:50:36,368 --> 00:50:37,911
Just get the number. Text it to me.

790
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:41,206
Cassidy. It's under It's very urgent.

791
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:42,832
<i>Dad, is Mum all right?</i>

792
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:47,087
<i>She hasn't come down. It's half-time.</i>

793
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:54,302
Sean, in the morning
I will talk to you about everything, okay?

794
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:58,890
Now, you just get me
the number of Cassidy, please.

795
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:11,736
<i>- Hello. Can I speak to Ivan Locke?
- This is Ivan Locke.</i>

796
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:15,282
<i>I'm Dr. Halil Gullu. I'm the senior
obstetrician at St. Mary's Hospital.</i>

797
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,284
<i>- You have a call waiting.
- We have a Bethan Maguire here</i>

798
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:20,245
<i>who's given us this number
as the number of her next of kin.</i>

799
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,622
<i>- Are you her next of kin?
- What's happening?</i>

800
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,583
<i>I'm sorry. Are you the next of kin?</i>

801
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:27,460
- I am the father.
- Excuse me. Hang on.

802
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,339
<i>I'll deal with that.</i>

803
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:34,301
<i>Mr. Locke, I'm sorry,
we have a situation here</i>

804
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:36,970
<i>where the baby's umbilical cord
is wrapped around the baby's neck.</i>

805
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:39,514
<i>- Yes, I know. Yes.
- And the baby is very distressed.</i>

806
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,474
And you're going to carry out a cesarean.

807
00:51:41,641 --> 00:51:45,228
<i>Yes, that's right, but Miss Maguire says
she wants to wait until you are here.</i>

808
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,898
Well, she's distressed.
She's quite an odd person, I think.

809
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:52,027
<i>Look, if we're gonna get her to cooperate,
I really need you to speak to her.</i>

810
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:54,487
Of course you do, absolutely.
Go on, put her on.

811
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:57,157
<i>Thank you very much. Please hold the line.</i>

812
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:01,411
<i>- Bethan.
- They want to do it now.</i>

813
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:04,539
Right, well, let them do it.
I've said let them do it.

814
00:52:04,664 --> 00:52:07,751
It doesn't matter if I'm not there
for the moment of the birth

815
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,170
because I will still be there in the morning,

816
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,839
before morning, in fact,
and it will still be the same clay.

817
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,549
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm on the motorway.</i>

818
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:18,678
Luton. Now, you let them do it
and don't be silly.

819
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,139
<i>Fuck you!</i>

820
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:25,852
<i>Ivan, you know I told them it was one night.</i>

821
00:52:26,019 --> 00:52:29,147
<i>I told them about the room
and feeling so sad after.</i>

822
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:30,523
<i>- Yes.
- But the nurse said,</i>

823
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:33,860
<i>"If he's coming all this way down,
he must feel something."</i>

824
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,945
<i>- If it was just once and I get pregnant...
- You're distressed.</i>

825
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:37,030
<i>...it's fate.</i>

826
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:40,659
<i>I told them I love you,
even if it was just once.</i>

827
00:52:40,784 --> 00:52:42,535
Well, there's no need to say that.

828
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:44,829
<i>- And it'll be ours.
- Yes.</i>

829
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:48,166
<i>How far away are you?</i>

830
00:52:49,084 --> 00:52:50,377
Bethan.

831
00:52:50,502 --> 00:52:53,588
Now, a baby is something
that cannot be stopped.

832
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:57,050
You have to take
all the practical steps to prepare.

833
00:52:57,175 --> 00:53:01,680
<i>- You want me to let them cut me open.
- Yes. I mean, it is the best thing.</i>

834
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,017
<i>Okay. I'll do it because I love you.</i>

835
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,603
Okay, then.

836
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,732
<i>Can you not say it back, even once?</i>

837
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:15,902
No, I can't. Look... I can't.

838
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:20,907
But I can be there
as fast as the traffic will allow.

839
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:41,761
<i>Ivan, I just found Sean
looking through your pockets.</i>

840
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:45,098
<i>- He said you asked him for a phone number.
- Yes.</i>

841
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:48,643
<i>Now, at this moment,
you need a phone number?</i>

842
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:53,606
I know how it looks, but I need to...
I need to confirm a stop and go.

843
00:53:53,732 --> 00:53:58,445
Tomorrow there's a pour.
It's a big... It is historical.

844
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:02,615
- It is the biggest pour in Europe.
- Can you hear yourself, <i>Ivan?</i>

845
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:07,078
<i>I'm falling apart at home
and you're closing roads?</i>

846
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:08,371
It's not a closure, it's a stop and go.

847
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:12,041
<i>The woman is giving birth
and you're closing roads.</i>

848
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,880
<i>Since you've told me about this woman,</i>

849
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:21,134
<i>you have been getting
further and further away from who I know.</i>

850
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:24,137
<i>No, actually, it might be that I do know.</i>

851
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:28,475
<i>In the... In the kitchen,
your footprints, they go hard</i>

852
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:30,310
<i>and I have to chip them away.</i>

853
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:33,396
<i>You leave concrete behind you everywhere.</i>

854
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,107
Katrina, I love you.

855
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:38,318
Okay? I made one mistake.

856
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:40,487
I don't feel anything for this woman,

857
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,822
and I'm trying to do the right thing tonight,

858
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:46,618
because she is on her own
and the baby is my fault.

859
00:54:47,494 --> 00:54:51,706
And I know how it feels
to be coming out into the world like this.

860
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:58,087
There is someone being brought
into the world and it's my fault.

861
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:01,299
- So I have to fix it, somehow.
- Oh, my God.

862
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:08,223
I would really like it if you would say
that you will wait and I can come back

863
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:11,768
and we can talk... We can talk about it

864
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:15,188
and that we can fix something up.

865
00:55:15,355 --> 00:55:21,027
I really want to know
that tomorrow I can drive home

866
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:24,739
and talk to the boys
and be at home as normal,

867
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:31,037
and we can go out or something
and have a drink and talk about it.

868
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:35,041
I want to know
that I am not driving in one direction...

869
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:42,715
I want to know that I will be driving back
when the sun comes up.

870
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:45,927
<i>Ivan, let me ask you a question.</i>

871
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:52,559
<i>Do you still want me to give you the
phone number so you can close the road?</i>

872
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:55,895
Yes.

873
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,106
<i>Right, well, goodbye, Ivan.</i>

874
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:58,791
Yes.

875
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:02,045
<i>I think I've just done something
on my own initiative.</i>

876
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:03,129
You did?

877
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:07,425
<i>I found the mobile number for
the council guy who signs off the closures.</i>

878
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:11,471
<i>- Cassidy?
- Yeah, Cassidy. That's him.</i>

879
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:13,139
You found his number?

880
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,308
<i>Yeah, I have his mobile number.
I knew you'd need it.</i>

881
00:57:15,475 --> 00:57:17,977
<i>You took it over Christmas in case,
and I found it.</i>

882
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:19,854
- Donal, you did that?
- Yeah!

883
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:23,650
<i>And that's on two cans of fucking cider.
Do you want it?</i>

884
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:27,153
Okay, right. Well, give me the number.

885
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:29,614
<i>Okay, okay, Okay-</i>

886
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:33,326
- 07700-900...
- 077... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

887
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,495
07700...

888
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:41,292
- 900957.
- 07700-900.

889
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:42,835
- 077. ..
- 957.

890
00:57:42,961 --> 00:57:44,963
<i>- 00.</i> ..
<i>- Okay, yeah.</i>

891
00:57:45,088 --> 00:57:49,842
<i>- 1300557.
- No, no, no. 957.</i>

892
00:57:49,968 --> 00:57:53,471
900957.

893
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:55,890
<i>- 957. Did you write it down?
- No, it's in my head. Thank you.</i>

894
00:58:01,354 --> 00:58:02,522
957.

895
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,194
Jesus.

896
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,490
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

897
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:14,701
Pick up the phone.

898
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:18,705
- Hello?
- Mr. Cassidy?

899
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,708
It's Ivan Locke from the Park project.

900
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:22,875
<i>Who?</i>

901
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:27,130
I'm running the site at Claremount.
We've some road closures agreed.

902
00:58:27,213 --> 00:58:29,882
<i>- How did you get this number?
- You gave it to me.</i>

903
00:58:30,008 --> 00:58:32,010
You gave it to me
in case anything came up over Christmas.

904
00:58:32,135 --> 00:58:35,555
<i>- Yeah, well, it's not Christmas.
- Yes, but I need a sign-off.</i>

905
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,392
<i>- I'm in an Indian restaurant.
- Yes, but I need a sign-off.</i>

906
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:42,687
<i>- Seriously, I need it.
- I told you, I'm in an Indian restaurant.</i>

907
00:58:42,812 --> 00:58:46,816
Okay, if I give you the number of the
duty officer at the Belmount Police Station...

908
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:50,319
<i>- This'll have to wait. Sorry.
- No, please. Shit.</i>

909
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:52,071
- No, please, please, please.
- No.

910
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:54,323
<i>- Please. Please... No.
- This will have to wait.</i>

911
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:56,701
Without this... It can't wait.

912
00:58:56,826 --> 00:58:59,370
<i>- Concrete is coming tomorrow.
- I'm in a bloody Indian restaurant!</i>

913
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:01,039
Yes, I know and I'm really sorry.

914
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:05,251
Please. I just need you, please,
to call the duty officer.

915
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:11,549
<i>- You're Ivan Locke?
- Yes.</i>

916
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:16,095
<i>I remember you. You ran a tight ship.</i>

917
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,263
Yes.

918
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:21,267
<i>The only construction director
who gave us paperwork ahead of time.</i>

919
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:24,604
Yes, yes, but tonight, I'm sorry,
things have just...

920
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:27,190
They've happened beyond my control.

921
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:29,776
<i>Okay, okay, Okay-</i>

922
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:32,195
<i>- Give me the bloody number.
- Thank you.</i>

923
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:37,408
Okay. 07957-452...

924
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:50,421
You know, I could have easily
let the concrete go to hell,

925
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:52,131
but I didn't.

926
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:55,635
You know, Dad, when you came
creeping back, saying you were sorry,

927
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:58,221
it was even worse than staying away.

928
00:59:58,805 --> 01:00:00,348
Yes, I'm serious.

929
01:00:00,473 --> 01:00:04,644
I could have broken
your fucking back for that, but I didn't.

930
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:08,773
And the fact that I could have done it
was worse than anything, you know?

931
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:11,442
Because you were so fucking weak.

932
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:15,488
That was the first thing I noticed. So weak.

933
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:22,411
All the things I fucking despise
inside one fucking stupid green shirt.

934
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,956
<i>You looked pathetic.</i>

935
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:28,584
<i>My fucking dad in...
What were they? They were trainers.</i>

936
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:33,673
<i>They were some sort of fucking trainers
that teenagers wear.</i>

937
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,883
<i>And your hair was all over the place.</i>

938
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:39,804
You don't drink anymore
and you don't fucking smoke dope.

939
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:43,933
We're all supposed to celebrate, is that it?
Celebrate what, exactly?

940
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:45,726
I was 23 years old

941
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:49,105
and this old cunt
comes from the fucking blue sky.

942
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:52,692
He says, "Guess what, everybody. I've..."

943
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:54,819
- What
- lvan.

944
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:57,029
<i>- What?
- lvan, it's all going to hell.</i>

945
01:00:57,155 --> 01:00:58,531
What?

946
01:00:58,698 --> 01:01:03,578
<i>The rebars in the shuttering in pit six,
they wouldn't hold a fucking kitten's fart.</i>

947
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:06,998
<i>It's those mavericks from up north
we put in there at the last minute.</i>

948
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:09,792
- What tension did they hold?
- They hold nothing!

949
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:12,086
<i>They hold nothing at all.
It came away with a push.</i>

950
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:13,588
ls there anybody there?

951
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:16,507
<i>No, shutterers all went home ages ago.
They're not in till 6:00.</i>

952
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:22,680
<i>- Right, call the Albanian.
- No, I've tried the Albanian.</i>

953
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:24,807
<i>He's not answering.
Nobody's answering. Nobody's answering.</i>

954
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:27,894
<i>There's some fucking football game on!</i>

955
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,065
<i>- Could you call in your sons?
- No, they're in Germany.</i>

956
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:36,861
<i>- They're digging out missile silos.
- Okay, okay, Donal. Here's what you do.</i>

957
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:41,240
You drive down to the ring road
near the fire station, okay?

958
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,576
And you'll see a road gang laying lines.

959
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:46,621
You ask for a guy called Stefan. He's Polish.

960
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:51,209
Tell him there's 500 pounds for him
and two of his best diggers

961
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:53,628
if they can get down and fix up some rebars.

962
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:55,046
<i>A road 981197?</i>

963
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:57,131
Yes, I know. But I know them. I know them.

964
01:01:57,256 --> 01:02:00,927
They're slumming it for the cash.
Stefan is the best concrete farmer I know.

965
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:03,763
Now, you mention my name. He owes me.

966
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:10,853
<i>So, do I have to drive down there?
Can I not just ring them?</i>

967
01:02:12,355 --> 01:02:14,941
Donal, how many ciders have you had?

968
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,485
Donal?

969
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:21,530
Donal, I don't have Stefan's number.
You'll need to drive down there.

970
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:24,784
They'll be knocking off
and going home in, like, half an hour.

971
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:27,286
<i>Okay, Ivan, I'm gonna be straight with you.</i>

972
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,080
<i>I'm not drunk.</i>

973
01:02:30,373 --> 01:02:33,626
<i>I'm not drunk, okay, but
I've had too much to get behind a wheel.</i>

974
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:36,295
<i>If I get stopped again, I go inside.</i>

975
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,548
<i>And I can't do that.</i>

976
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:44,428
Okay, then you run.

977
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:46,681
- I <i>run?</i>
- Yeah.

978
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:51,477
Stefan and his men will knock off
in half an hour due to council regulations

979
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:54,063
because they can't burn
bitumen lights after 10:00.

980
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:56,315
So if you run, you'll get there
before they get in their van.

981
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:58,192
<i>What do you mean, run?
I'm not gonna fucking run.</i>

982
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:00,111
You will fucking run, Donal.

983
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:02,822
<i>- I haven't... I'm not...
- You will fucking run now.</i>

984
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:05,157
Go, or my building won't get built.

985
01:03:06,993 --> 01:03:08,452
<i>- Are you mad?
- Yes.</i>

986
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:10,079
<i>- Run? I'm not...
- Yes, I'm mad.</i>

987
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:14,500
Tonight I've gone mad
and I will have to get used to being mad.

988
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,502
<i>- You have a call waiting.
- And Donal...</i>

989
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:20,673
- I can hear in your voice when you're drunk.
- I'm not.

990
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:23,134
No, but when you're drunk,
you can run faster, can't you?

991
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:25,678
For a while at least.
You can run like a fucking kid.

992
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:28,264
You can run like the fucking wind.

993
01:03:29,015 --> 01:03:31,350
<i>So I'm gonna get out of my boots
and put on my trainers?</i>

994
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:33,853
<i>- My run-fast trainers?
- Yes, yes. Then you run.</i>

995
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,189
<i>So you want me to run?
Run for those fucking bastards in Chicago</i>

996
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:39,108
<i>who don't give a shit if I live or if I die?</i>

997
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:44,030
No, you do it for the piece of sky
we are stealing with our building.

998
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:46,365
You do it for the air that will be displaced,

999
01:03:46,532 --> 01:03:49,201
and most of all
you do it for the fucking concrete.

1000
01:03:49,327 --> 01:03:51,037
Because it is delicate as blood.

1001
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:53,622
<i>You really have gone fucking mad, right?</i>

1002
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:56,375
Well, that would be a fair assessment, yes.

1003
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:58,836
<i>All right.</i>

1004
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:03,716
<i>- Right, Ivan, here I go!
- You're a good man, Donal.</i>

1005
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:06,886
You are, you're a good man.
Go on now, run. Run!

1006
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:10,681
It will work out. I will make sure of it.

1007
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:12,391
You'll see. You'll see.

1008
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:14,977
You see, you take things in your own hands,

1009
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:18,898
and you push against it
and you push against it until it's upright.

1010
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:21,776
And you stick to the plan.

1011
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:36,082
<i>Hi. This is Bethan.
I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

1012
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:37,416
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1013
01:04:38,751 --> 01:04:40,419
Bethan, it's me.

1014
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:45,091
I know they're operating on you right now,
but I just wanted to say good luck.

1015
01:04:46,717 --> 01:04:49,762
Good luck, Bethan.
This baby is a good thing.

1016
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,056
And you deserve to be happy.

1017
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:59,438
You see? Life.

1018
01:05:01,774 --> 01:05:04,110
Yes, life sentence.

1019
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:06,112
So what?

1020
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:11,909
I will do what needs to be done,
even if they hate me or love me.

1021
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:14,954
You have to be solid

1022
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:17,123
so that it makes no difference
what they think.

1023
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:20,793
You know,
if I were to bury you tonight, again,

1024
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:22,920
before I threw dirt on your face,

1025
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:25,464
I would say, "Look.

1026
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,759
"Look and fucking learn."

1027
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:31,637
I drove in this direction

1028
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,723
and there will be a new person
when I get there.

1029
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:37,143
Yes, because of that night.

1030
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:42,982
Constructed out of two bottles of wine
and somebody feeling lonely.

1031
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:47,111
How could you ever beat that
for a construction?

1032
01:05:56,996 --> 01:05:59,081
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>
- Sean.

1033
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:02,001
- We won.
- What was the score?

1034
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:05,212
- 3-1.
- Good. Good.

1035
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:09,842
Good.

1036
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:14,180
<i>Caldwell, Robinson and Caldwell again.</i>

1037
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:15,681
Good.

1038
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:18,684
Is everything okay?

1039
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:20,769
<i>Yeah.</i>

1040
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:23,689
<i>No.</i>

1041
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:28,402
<i>Mum looks like she's seen a ghost.
She broke some plates.</i>

1042
01:06:29,195 --> 01:06:31,197
Yes, well, something's happened.

1043
01:06:31,322 --> 01:06:33,991
I'll explain when I'm not driving.

1044
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,542
<i>She's upstairs.</i>

1045
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:45,878
Yes, I'll explain when I'm not driving

1046
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:48,547
and when I'm with you
and Eddie together, you know?

1047
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:50,174
I-

1048
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,470
I've only just explained it to myself.

1049
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:57,223
<i>She said you're not coming home ever.</i>

1050
01:06:57,348 --> 01:06:59,683
Well, she's distressed.

1051
01:07:01,227 --> 01:07:03,062
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

1052
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,649
Where else would I go?

1053
01:07:06,732 --> 01:07:08,901
<i>So I'll tell Eddie that you are coming home?</i>

1054
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:10,569
<i>He's been crying.</i>

1055
01:07:11,362 --> 01:07:15,407
Look, when I get to the other end, I'll call.

1056
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:21,455
Sean, you tell Eddie that it's okay,

1057
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:24,375
that I'll make it okay, okay?

1058
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:28,212
<i>Doesn't feel like it's okay.</i>

1059
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:31,423
<i>Felt different after half-time.</i>

1060
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:34,760
I'll fix it and it'll all go back to normal.

1061
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:40,224
- Now, you should go to bed.
- Yeah.

1062
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:44,895
<i>- Third goal was amazing.</i>
- Caldwell?

1063
01:07:44,979 --> 01:07:49,066
<i>- Took it round the keeper.
- Good God. Caldwell's a donkey.</i>

1064
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:52,444
<i>Normally he's a donkey,
but tonight he was brilliant.</i>

1065
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,614
It's a miracle. What a miracle!

1066
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:00,452
Right, that's it. Go on, good night.

1067
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:04,707
<i>- Night, Dad. See you tomorrow.
- Yes, absolutely, hopefully.</i>

1068
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,626
We'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow.

1069
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:25,853
<i>You know, I nearly got fucking run down
by a taxi there, running.</i>

1070
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:27,980
<i>- Did you find Stefan?
- Jesus Christ.</i>

1071
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,898
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

1072
01:08:29,982 --> 01:08:32,443
<i>Right, I can see the flames. They're burning.</i>

1073
01:08:32,568 --> 01:08:34,653
<i>Oh, my God. They're burning the road.</i>

1074
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,823
<i>- I can smell...
- You have a call waiting.</i>

1075
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:42,161
<i>- The bitumen, it's getting in my throat.
- His name is Stefan, Donal.</i>

1076
01:08:42,328 --> 01:08:44,496
Give them 500 each.

1077
01:08:45,331 --> 01:08:48,167
<i>Oh, man, Ivan, I'm fucking... I'm fucked!</i>

1078
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:49,501
You sound sober.

1079
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:53,839
Now, listen, you tell Stefan
to bring two men and a jack.

1080
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:55,341
500 apiece.

1081
01:08:56,008 --> 01:08:57,718
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1082
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,971
<i>Yeah, I'll call you
when I've got the Poles in my... Fuck!</i>

1083
01:09:01,096 --> 01:09:02,806
<i>In my grasp, okay?</i>

1084
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,683
<i>Jesus, my heart's coming out...</i>

1085
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:09,021
Stefan is a good man.

1086
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:13,692
He will fix the pit and check the others.
All 12 pumps will work.

1087
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:16,987
The stop-go will run.

1088
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:22,409
The north, south, east and west gates
will all take their quarter of concrete.

1089
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:24,870
The baby will be born.

1090
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:27,247
And Katrina will be okay.

1091
01:09:27,915 --> 01:09:30,334
In the morning she will be okay.

1092
01:09:31,043 --> 01:09:34,713
That is how it can be. That is my prayer.

1093
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:37,883
<i>And when the baby is born,</i>

1094
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:41,053
<i>when he's 7 or when she's 7,</i>

1095
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:42,221
<i>it'll say it's okay.</i>

1096
01:09:42,388 --> 01:09:46,225
<i>And the name will be Locke.
Locke is okay. We do okay.</i>

1097
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,770
<i>Because...
Because I straightened the name out.</i>

1098
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:57,361
The Lockes were a long line of shit,
but I straightened the name out.

1099
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:02,241
You know what, you old bastard?
You know what? I know now.

1100
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,743
I know now why you ran away.

1101
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:08,914
Yeah?

1102
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:12,751
<i>Okay, okay, okay.
I'm in a van with three Poles</i>

1103
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:16,755
<i>who smell like fucking burning rooftops.</i>

1104
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,426
<i>And they said 600, right,
so I guess you're gonna say yeah?</i>

1105
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:22,928
<i>- Yes.
- Yeah, good, okay.</i>

1106
01:10:23,053 --> 01:10:24,888
<i>This guy Stefan,
he doesn't say much, does he?</i>

1107
01:10:24,972 --> 01:10:27,933
<i>- Well, no, but he's a good man.
- You want a word with him?</i>

1108
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:31,353
No. Stefan knows what to do.
You'll be okay now, Donal.

1109
01:10:31,437 --> 01:10:33,272
- Yeah, yeah.
- You fix up the rebars

1110
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:35,315
and start preparing the gates.

1111
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:37,985
- Okay.
- It will be a long night.

1112
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:40,612
<i>Jesus, I'm stone-cold sober now.</i>

1113
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:42,698
I know. I know. It all worked out.

1114
01:10:43,699 --> 01:10:44,950
- What?
- I said...

1115
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:48,370
<i>Wait, wait, wait...
Stefan just said, "Say hello."</i>

1116
01:10:48,454 --> 01:10:51,081
<i>He said, "Say hello to Ivan Locke."</i>

1117
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:52,916
<i>What? Right.</i>

1118
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:57,296
<i>He says to say
you're the best man in England.</i>

1119
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,267
<i>- lvan?
- Yes.</i>

1120
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:11,810
<i>I've decided.</i>

1121
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:14,646
Kat, you know what?
We can work this out. I know we can.

1122
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:18,484
<i>No, no, no.
I've spoken to my sister and my half-sister.</i>

1123
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:22,488
<i>And the difference between
once and never is everything.</i>

1124
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:26,325
<i>So, that's it. And it never is once anyway.</i>

1125
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,787
<i>- Katrina, listen...
- I don't want you to come back, Ivan.</i>

1126
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:33,040
<i>This is not your home anymore
and I want you to stay away.</i>

1127
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:34,750
Katrina, please, listen.

1128
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:37,836
<i>We will make arrangements
for seeing the boys.</i>

1129
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:40,923
<i>But, look, I... I don't want you coming here.</i>

1130
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:46,512
<i>You were always more in love
with your buildings anyway.</i>

1131
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:48,305
<i>Why don't you go and live in one of them?</i>

1132
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,932
<i>I mean, right at the top
where you like to look out</i>

1133
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,267
<i>and feel so pleased with yourself.</i>

1134
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:57,356
<i>Hey, I'm gonna wash everything here,</i>

1135
01:11:57,481 --> 01:12:01,193
<i>wash it all out 10 times
to get the dust of you out of it.</i>

1136
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:05,823
<i>I won't have to deal with your footprints</i>

1137
01:12:05,948 --> 01:12:08,367
<i>turning to stone
on the kitchen floor anymore.</i>

1138
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:14,331
<i>It's finished. This isn't your home.</i>

1139
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:02,648
Ivan Locke.

1140
01:14:02,773 --> 01:14:04,816
<i>Ivan, I've put
a construction director onto this.</i>

1141
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:08,403
<i>He's tried to reach Donal 100 times,
but Donal isn't picking up.</i>

1142
01:14:09,988 --> 01:14:12,282
<i>Are you there, Ivan?</i>

1143
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:13,909
Yes.

1144
01:14:13,992 --> 01:14:18,997
<i>Look, can you reach Donal and tell him
he's got to pick up his phone immediately?</i>

1145
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:22,209
<i>Ivan?</i>

1146
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:26,672
Tell your construction director
there's no need to speak to Donal.

1147
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:28,715
Everything's already taken care of.

1148
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,634
<i>Ivan, for fuck's sake, I can't do this.</i>

1149
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:35,681
Everything is taken care of
and everything is ready for 5:25.

1150
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:38,350
<i>- There will be no mistakes.
- You have a call waiting.</i>

1151
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:42,145
I have made sure of everything
and I've made sure everything is in place.

1152
01:14:42,229 --> 01:14:45,440
You can go to sleep now, Gareth.
Good night.

1153
01:14:47,859 --> 01:14:50,195
<i>You know, I actually threw up earlier.</i>

1154
01:14:50,362 --> 01:14:52,489
<i>- Yeah?
- Fucking yeah.</i>

1155
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:55,701
Well, hear this, Gareth.

1156
01:14:56,535 --> 01:14:59,579
When I left the site just over 2 hours ago,

1157
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:04,209
I had a job, a wife, a home.

1158
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:08,672
And now I have none of those things.
I have none of those things left.

1159
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:11,633
I just have myself and the car that I'm in.

1160
01:15:11,717 --> 01:15:14,011
And I'm just driving and that's it.

1161
01:15:18,265 --> 01:15:21,893
<i>Ivan, you fucked up your life,
that's your business,</i>

1162
01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:24,396
<i>but Chicago is going insane.</i>

1163
01:15:27,232 --> 01:15:29,860
Two words I learned tonight.

1164
01:15:31,069 --> 01:15:32,070
Fuck Chicago.

1165
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:57,137
<i>This is Ivan Locke. Please leave a message.</i>

1166
01:15:59,765 --> 01:16:02,392
<i>Hey, Dad. It's Eddie.</i>

1167
01:16:03,018 --> 01:16:05,937
<i>I'm on my mobile. I'm under the duvet.</i>

1168
01:16:07,105 --> 01:16:10,275
I... <i>I just wanted to tell you about the</i> goal.

1169
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:15,906
<i>Caldwell got it in
and he controlled it, you know?</i>

1170
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:20,327
<i>You know how you shout at him
because it always flies off into the crowd?</i>

1171
01:16:20,452 --> 01:16:24,039
<i>Yeah, he controlled it
and he got it down on the ground,</i>

1172
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:27,918
<i>and you know how you say
he just lumps it forward all the time?</i>

1173
01:16:28,043 --> 01:16:29,711
<i>Well, he got it down on the ground.</i>

1174
01:16:29,795 --> 01:16:31,963
<i>This is Caldwell, Dad, and he just...</i>

1175
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:35,133
<i>He just started running
and running and running.</i>

1176
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:36,593
<i>And...</i>

1177
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:39,805
<i>And these defenders
were just bouncing off him.</i>

1178
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:42,265
<i>And he went round one and then the other.</i>

1179
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:45,102
<i>And me and Sean were standing up
and shouting at him to pass the ball.</i>

1180
01:16:45,227 --> 01:16:46,770
<i>"Pass the ball!"</i>

1181
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:50,065
<i>You say you've got to square it.</i>

1182
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:51,942
<i>He wouldn't square it. He wouldn't pass.</i>

1183
01:16:52,067 --> 01:16:54,736
<i>He just... He just kept running.</i>

1184
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:58,156
<i>He was...
He looked like a horse or something.</i>

1185
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:00,867
<i>And then the goalie's coming forward</i>

1186
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:03,870
<i>and we think he's gonna boot it over the bar.</i>

1187
01:17:05,205 --> 01:17:08,542
<i>Remember against...
Anyway, whoever it was.</i>

1188
01:17:09,334 --> 01:17:13,547
<i>And we thought he was gonna boot it
over the bar again, but he didn't.</i>

1189
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:18,009
<i>This is Caldwell, Dad,
the one you say is always a donkey.</i>

1190
01:17:19,845 --> 01:17:22,764
<i>He went round the goalie and put it in.</i>

1191
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:29,229
<i>Mum was crying, so she didn't even see it.</i>

1192
01:17:31,273 --> 01:17:36,027
<i>But we recorded it for you, so you have to
come home and watch it, okay?</i>

1193
01:17:36,153 --> 01:17:39,990
<i>You have to come home,
and I have an idea, okay?</i>

1194
01:17:40,115 --> 01:17:43,660
<i>So, we'll pretend we don't know the score</i>

1195
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:47,789
<i>and pretend it's happening then,
pretend it's live.</i>

1196
01:17:47,873 --> 01:17:51,209
<i>And me and Sean will go mad all the same,
and you can have your beer</i>

1197
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:54,171
<i>and Mum can make the sausages, so...</i>

1198
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:56,882
<i>So, that's what we'll do.</i>

1199
01:17:58,425 --> 01:18:00,218
<i>Good night, Dad.</i>

1200
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:42,469
<i>Ivan?</i>

1201
01:18:46,097 --> 01:18:48,099
ls everything okay?

1202
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,271
<i>Listen.</i>

1203
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:07,786
<i>Ivan, will you come?</i>

1204
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:11,915
Yes.
