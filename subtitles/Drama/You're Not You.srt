1
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:09,651
Perfect.

2
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,941
Promise you'll turn me on like this
on your 70th birthday?

3
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:19,040
- Promise.
- Yeah?

4
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:23,774
- Happy birthday, Katie-cakes.
- Thank you.

5
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:26,506
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yep.

6
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:53,472
Yep, I'm gonna see you on Tuesday.
The fabric is perfect.

7
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,805
I picked out something
very special for you.

8
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:59,195
Okay. Bye. I'll see you then.

9
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:23,006
Look at you,
working all hard over here.

10
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:24,705
Don't even think about it.

11
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:26,805
You should have let me
take you out tonight.

12
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:29,372
Come on, you know I love
this kind of thing.

13
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:31,341
Yeah.

14
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,371
- Hey, let me grab it.
- No, I got it. It's okay.

15
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,071
- Get the towel.
- Get outta here.

16
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:39,462
- Alright. Alright.
- Go.

17
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,905
Oh, my God. Look at your body
in that dress.

18
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:50,270
- I look like an unmade bed.
- Scallop canapes? Seriously?

19
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,603
- It's nothing. Here.
- Oh, you always say that.

20
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:54,270
- Oh, please.
- And then you say that.

21
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,770
Oh, plea...

22
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,703
- At UT, she turned me down 3 times.
- It took him 2 years to notice me.

23
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:03,304
- So what finally sealed the deal?
- That's none of your damn business.

24
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:05,670
- Go ahead and tell 'em.
- You tell 'em.

25
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,637
No, no, you tell 'em.

26
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:10,736
When Bill and I were dating,
he told me I looked good drunk.

27
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:11,970
Is it better than that?

28
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,865
He said, "I like me better
when I'm with you."

29
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,350
To Kate...

30
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,944
my gorgeous wife, on her 35th birthday.

31
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:24,457
- Evan, please.
- When I saw you 15 years ago,

32
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:28,967
I said to myself, "There's a girl that
I need to know." And look at you now...

33
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,875
even more amazing.

34
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:35,103
Happy birthday, Kate. 15 straight.

35
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,869
And we're just getting started.

36
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:42,119
- I love you.
- I love you.

37
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:44,253
What is this?

38
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:49,802
What's wrong?

39
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:53,202
You know, it's... it's beautiful,
and I love you so much,

40
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:55,102
but I just have to say something.

41
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:58,800
You guys are royally screwed.

42
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,635
Can't help it. Your piano's out of tune.

43
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,501
Don't listen to them, Bill.
You sound great.

44
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,945
- Thank you. Hey, care to join me?
- Oh, God, no.

45
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:14,134
Come on, Kate.
I haven't heard you play in years.

46
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:15,768
Get him off the piano.

47
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:18,635
- I can't even play Chopsticks now.
- It's not even a choice.

48
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,828
That's a first.

49
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,841
Oh, shit.

50
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:42,545
Shit.

51
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:53,398
Shit! Shit! Shit!

52
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,997
Hey, you! Out! Now!

53
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:58,897
- You wanna go again?
- No. No going again.

54
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:02,114
- That's not what you said last night.
- Out, now.

55
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:05,628
- Well, I remember your name.
- Goody.

56
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:07,698
- Shit!
- Bec.

57
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:11,031
Nobody calls you Rebecca,
except your old lady.

58
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:13,031
She's on at you for being
a 5th-year senior.

59
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:17,467
- Please put your pants on.
- After switching majors 6 times in 3 years.

60
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:20,932
- Pants! Now!
- Alright.

61
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:45,375
You're with your friends.

62
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:55,817
We don't have to do the whole
number exchange thing, right?

63
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,788
Right. I think I love you!

64
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:10,294
I know you gotta go.
You know what, let me finish.

65
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:11,927
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

66
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:15,793
Look, I got this down
to a science, honey.

67
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:17,894
I gotta go to work
in 40 minutes. Just let me...

68
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:20,352
I can do it. Just give me a minute.

69
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:25,673
Look, I know
that it's important to you.

70
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:31,190
Just let me finish it. Okay?
There you go.

71
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:33,293
Did Mrs. Trotter say
she was gonna be late?

72
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:35,160
She's not coming.

73
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:40,293
What do you mean?
As in all day she's not coming?

74
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:43,660
- As in I let her go.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What?

75
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,426
She made me feel like a patient.
I'm not a patient.

76
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,993
Kate. Kate. Katie, listen.

77
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:52,859
We finally found somebody
who was efficient.

78
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,726
Somebody who I can trust. Somebody who
can be flexible when I'm running late.

79
00:08:56,826 --> 00:09:00,759
You can't just be making
these decisions without...

80
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:06,122
- Let me call Miles.
- I'm interviewing for a replacement. Okay?

81
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,092
Okay, this is crazy.

82
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:13,459
- I'm interviewing...
- Right now?

83
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,492
- You're interviewing for a replacement?
- Go to work and I'll interview her.

84
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,791
Right now?
You're interviewing right now?

85
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,013
Let me interview her,

86
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:23,000
- and the you can meet her later.
- No, no. No, I don't...

87
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,968
- It's okay.
- We'll interview her together.

88
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:37,791
Oops.

89
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:43,786
I'm Bec... Cartwell.
I'm here for the job interview.

90
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:52,464
Thank you.

91
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,091
So... which one of you plays piano?

92
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:02,552
- I do. Did.
- Why'd you give it up?

93
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:07,124
- Right.
- I assume you brought a CV?

94
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:11,182
- Resume.
- No, I brought a resume.

95
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:15,153
I found Bec on the university website.

96
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:19,122
It says your most recent
place of employment

97
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:22,812
was the Red Lobster
on the Sam Houston Tollway?

98
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:25,524
Wait. Sorry. Wrong one.

99
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:27,523
Yeah. It's a...

100
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:31,122
little different than the one
I put in the email.

101
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:33,423
I kinda padded that one.

102
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:37,523
So, who was taking care of you before?
If you don't mind my asking.

103
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:41,988
Not at all. We had
a lovely woman who moved on.

104
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,155
And before that, my mother.

105
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:47,222
- Wow, that takes balls.
- Yes. It wasn't perfect.

106
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:50,788
If it was me and my mother,
it would have been like...

107
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:52,721
braaghhh, bloodshed by lunchtime.

108
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:55,922
I assume housekeeping
isn't in your skill set.

109
00:10:56,022 --> 00:11:00,095
Do you cook? Any nursing experience?

110
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:02,855
Tell me, Bec, have you ever seen,
let alone cared for,

111
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:06,172
someone suffering from a major
degenerative illness?

112
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:09,755
Not really.
I've read some stuff online.

113
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:12,155
You read some stuff online.

114
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,156
Okay, well, it was nice to meet you.
I'm sure you're very bright.

115
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:18,579
What did you mean by "not really"?

116
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:28,425
Back in high school, I volunteered
at a nursing home in Tyler.

117
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:32,295
They stuck my Grammy Jones
in there and I was there a lot.

118
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:35,075
I didn't put it down
'cause it was a while ago.

119
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,953
You got your broccoli,
you got your beets.

120
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:44,220
- Evan, you're gonna be late.
- Carrots. Got your chopping board.

121
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,520
You got your knife. After you chop...

122
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,553
- Evan, I can show her.
- Hold on.

123
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:52,220
You add your vitamins...

124
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:55,210
and your immuno-boosts.

125
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,420
Alright? We wanna keep as many
calories in her as we can.

126
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,519
- Low fat is the enemy...
- Can I talk to you?

127
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,450
- Just give me a second to...
- Please.

128
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,420
Bathroom?

129
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,387
- Yeah, it's straight back over there.
- It's that way.

130
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:08,454
Sorry.

131
00:12:09,253 --> 00:12:11,452
Alright, this woman is a nightmare.

132
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:13,987
She's not a nurse. How can I trust
that you're gonna be okay with her?

133
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,553
Maybe she'll actually
listen to me, okay?

134
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,653
Look, will you please just
let me take care of this?

135
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:22,277
I promise you I'll make it work. Okay?

136
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:24,125
Okay?

137
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:26,661
Bec. Bec, could you please
cut on the cutting board?

138
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:28,886
Oh, cool.

139
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:33,601
So... ALS patients live, like, what...
2 to 5 years?

140
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,186
How long you been sick?

141
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:39,985
You don't put the broccoli stems
in the blender. Just the flower heads.

142
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:43,784
Don't worry, I'm not trying to calculate
when I'm gonna need to get another gig.

143
00:12:43,884 --> 00:12:46,617
Just curious where you are
on the timeline.

144
00:12:46,717 --> 00:12:49,899
- A year and a half.
- That's what gets me about this disease.

145
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:53,452
Your mind stays so fuckin' sharp,
while your arms and your legs...

146
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:55,418
Oh, no!

147
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:57,519
Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

148
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:03,744
Okay. First time for everything.

149
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,238
Okay, cool.

150
00:13:06,338 --> 00:13:09,968
Hey, no rush.
I'm just gonna be... right here.

151
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:12,519
- Just take your time.
- Bec, I'm going to need some help.

152
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:17,138
Getting on. And...

153
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll need some assistance after...

154
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,168
wiping.

155
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:26,185
What's funny?

156
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:30,117
It's just this thing
that my roommate Jill says.

157
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:34,807
She'd rather have cats than kids, until kids
learn how to shit in a litter box.

158
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,514
Oh, God, you're probably like a nice...

159
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:41,736
no-swearing,
no-sex-on-Sunday Baptist...

160
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:46,084
What I am is a grown woman
who needs help using the bathroom.

161
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:50,559
Okay, I am pulling your pants down.

162
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,114
And here go...

163
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:56,783
- your underwear.
- Can you skip the commentary?

164
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,847
Okay.

165
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:02,959
Why is this thing so fucking low?

166
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,592
Bec, your language.

167
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:13,417
I am unfurling the... toilet tissue.

168
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,183
Harder please.

169
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,450
What?

170
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:29,639
Wipe harder, please.

171
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:32,107
No problem.

172
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:35,023
Okay,

173
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:37,545
I'm lifting you up,

174
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:40,724
pulling up your pants...

175
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:43,446
for you...

176
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:48,130
Shit. Are you okay?

177
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:57,381
That wasn't even the worst part.

178
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,082
The worst part...
was that she didn't even get mad.

179
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:04,845
Like, she just sat there
with this perfect tight smile on her face.

180
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,847
Quiet freak out, way worse.
She needs to chill.

181
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:12,912
Here's to... yet another day
of finding something new I suck at.

182
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:19,867
Hey, superstar, you're up.
Please don't bomb this.

183
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:22,948
- You got this, Bec.
- I got it.

184
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,181
- You got it.
- I got it.

185
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:26,048
- You got it!
- I got it!

186
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:27,579
Yeah, she don't got it.

187
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,473
Hi.

188
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,712
I'm Bec...

189
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:13,209
and...

190
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:17,441
it's really cool to be here
at Dirty Barry's.

191
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:20,809
And now it's just me. Okay.

192
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:26,374
I'm gonna sing a song.

193
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:39,077
Get off the stage!

194
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,239
- Give me one second.
- Next!

195
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:57,544
Why do I keep doing this to myself?

196
00:16:57,644 --> 00:17:01,936
Did you know that Janis, Elvis and Waylon
all freaked out on that very same stage?

197
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:06,548
- I'm Wil, by the way.
- Why can't I just stop?

198
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:10,182
Speaking of which...

199
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:17,244
You do know that banging
your professor is a cliche, right?

200
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:22,631
We do not bang.
We exchange ideas... naked, in bed.

201
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:31,175
Is she always that...?

202
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,463
Yeah, it's not just you, dude.

203
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:36,673
- Okay.
- That's a nice work coat.

204
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:42,909
I don't know why I...

205
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:44,898
Thanks.

206
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:48,742
The only reason
I'm not totally pissed off you're late

207
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:50,542
is that I just took failure
to a whole new...

208
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:54,508
- Liam, here you go.
- Bec, this is Jen, my wife.

209
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:57,942
Jen, this is Bec, one of my students...
and a very good one at that.

210
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,859
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure's all mine.

211
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,675
- It's good to see you.
- I'm gonna get a drink.

212
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:42,802
Sorry.

213
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:44,740
Bec.

214
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:46,966
Bec.

215
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:49,040
Hey.

216
00:18:49,339 --> 00:18:52,097
Can I just borrow her
for a second there?

217
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:54,726
- We're actually...
- Just a sec.

218
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:58,206
- You know I'm married.
- And I have a boyfriend.

219
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:01,807
So you're just gonna have
to control your feelings...

220
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,807
every time you see me with Bill.

221
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:06,454
It's "Wil", actually.

222
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:09,538
Or Bill. Wil. Whatever.

223
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,751
Here.

224
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:15,774
Alright. I can drive.

225
00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:18,304
Guys, get off my truck.

226
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:21,472
- Git. Goodnight.
- Of course you have a truck.

227
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:24,189
- This is a good truck.
- Yes.

228
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:26,872
I knew she wouldn't work out.

229
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:28,504
I tell you what,
we'll get Mrs. Trotter back,

230
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:30,715
because, honestly, baby,
she was perfect for us.

231
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:35,706
She was perfect. I'm just glad that
that... What was her name?

232
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:37,839
Bec. Bec Cartwell.

233
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:42,514
I'm just glad that that is behind us
and we can get back to the way things were.

234
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,624
Alright, let's go to bed.

235
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:55,562
You're really hot.

236
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:36,737
Oh, my God, I feel like I'm sexing
a Jackson Pollock painting.

237
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:39,367
Okay.

238
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:54,737
Evan?

239
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:58,195
Yeah?

240
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:04,083
You wake me up
if you need anything. Alright?

241
00:21:04,183 --> 00:21:06,000
Goodnight.

242
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:29,551
- What the hell is that?
- I made you eggs.

243
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:34,366
Let's get one thing
real clear, real quick.

244
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:37,588
I'm not girlfriend material,
so we good?

245
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:40,668
Yeah, it's good, it's good.
Great. Perfect.

246
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:43,423
Lose my number, Liam.

247
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,706
Hold on. You want me back?

248
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:51,907
Yep. Yep, of course, Bec.
Love to have you back.

249
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:55,285
I just witnessed a hit-and-run,
and had to wait for a cop,

250
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:58,738
but I did find someone
who can deliver organic vegetables.

251
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:03,833
My cat was puking like crazy.
Nice suit. Italian?

252
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:09,266
We're not really interested
in your excuses.

253
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:11,702
This has been going on for weeks.

254
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:15,768
Evan has a very demanding schedule,
and I have a very demanding condition.

255
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:19,200
- You show up late again...
- Got it. Understand.

256
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,666
- Her charms more than allude me.
- She's young.

257
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:29,578
Okay, so ladies' night. You excited?

258
00:22:29,678 --> 00:22:30,969
Turning backflips.

259
00:22:31,069 --> 00:22:33,865
Hey, these are
your best friends, alright?

260
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:36,800
It's important that you
don't shut everybody out.

261
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,033
Besides, I can't cancel on Alex again.
He's gonna think I hate him.

262
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:43,566
You do hate him.

263
00:22:44,451 --> 00:22:48,660
I miss us just... being together.

264
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:55,061
Hey, I miss that, too. Okay?

265
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:58,022
I'll try to get back from dinner early,
I'll say hello to your friends,

266
00:22:58,122 --> 00:23:01,132
and then it'll be
just you and me, alright?

267
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:04,966
Okay. Love you. Bye.

268
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,818
So before we buy out the rest of Texas,

269
00:23:09,918 --> 00:23:12,766
you should probably know
I can't cook anything.

270
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:14,633
Like, not even Pop-Tarts.

271
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:18,166
- That's fine.
- I mean, like, at all.

272
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:22,365
You don't need to know how to cook.
You just need to know how to listen.

273
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:24,729
Alyssa, you look so good
I almost hate you.

274
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:27,165
- Oh, shut up.
- Especially after just having a baby.

275
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:29,565
I'm still fat as a cow,
I haven't slept in months,

276
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:33,416
and I would sell my kid
into slavery for half a Xanax.

277
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:37,692
I'm not even asking for a whole Xanax,
just give me half.

278
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:43,016
- So who's Evan having drinks with?
- Oh, Alex, but it's dinner.

279
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:47,837
I assumed it was drinks 'cause Tom said
he saw Evan walking into some bar.

280
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:50,208
Great, well, then...

281
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:52,530
his dinner turned into drinks.
Which means he'll be there all night,

282
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,693
- which means more time for us, right?
- Congratulations to us.

283
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:07,782
Will you start the salmon, please?

284
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,095
Thank you.

285
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:15,184
You know, honey, you're just tired.

286
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:17,397
It's gonna be a lot easier
once you get stronger.

287
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:20,796
I'm not getting stronger...

288
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:23,996
so please don't say that. I just...

289
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,803
I just hate when people say that.

290
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:28,730
We're just trying to be positive.
That's all.

291
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,086
I know.

292
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:34,409
- It's Evan.
- Put it on speaker.

293
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:37,346
- <i>Hey, ladies!</i>
- Hey.

294
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:41,872
So how's Alex?
He still a personal space invader?

295
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:43,397
<i>Only until the check arrives.</i>

296
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:47,330
<i>I'm hoping that Bec
might be open to a little OT,</i>

297
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,895
<i>at time and half, of course?</i>

298
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:50,562
- Why not?
- <i>Evan!</i>

299
00:24:50,762 --> 00:24:55,395
<i>Table's ready. That's the hostess.
Love you, hon. I gotta run.</i>

300
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,462
I love you, too.

301
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,095
Isn't he incredible?

302
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:04,162
Ladies, if I have so much as the flu,
Bill is ready to put me out with the trash.

303
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:07,229
I don't know what I'd do
without that man.

304
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:10,627
- I mean, a saint that one.
- Yeah.

305
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,061
Okay.

306
00:25:21,918 --> 00:25:25,662
Bec, in Evan's office, his computer.
Please bring it here.

307
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,525
Okay.

308
00:25:34,394 --> 00:25:36,465
Open it.

309
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,678
Check his emails.

310
00:25:40,931 --> 00:25:43,413
I'm not comfortable doing that.

311
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:45,126
Then you're fired.

312
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:54,494
I'll pay you $100.

313
00:25:54,793 --> 00:25:57,361
- You just fired me, remember?
- Two.

314
00:25:57,461 --> 00:26:00,694
I seriously doubt your husband's gonna leave
emails he didn't want you to find right...

315
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:06,815
Yeah, he will, because he knows
I can't access them because of my hands.

316
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,491
Fine. Fine, but I don't
want your money.

317
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:18,217
Show me.

318
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:22,199
See? It's nothing.

319
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:25,735
Just a whole bunch of messages
in legal gibberish.

320
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,405
There, on the bottom.

321
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,116
Thank you.

322
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:39,418
You can go.

323
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:44,444
- Kate, I...
- Please, just go.

324
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,623
Getting all Martha Stewart on my ass

325
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:43,312
for not evenly chopping vegetables,
I can handle, but...

326
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:47,091
- I've never seen her like this.
- Like what?

327
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,374
I don't know.

328
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:07,746
Who is it?

329
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,486
It's her, but it's blank.

330
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:13,713
I'm sure she's fine. It's not...

331
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:20,919
Kate?

332
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,963
Kate!

333
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:30,867
Hey, what happened? What's going on?

334
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,636
Hey, hey.

335
00:29:36,087 --> 00:29:38,054
I wet myself.

336
00:29:38,154 --> 00:29:41,530
Hurry. He can't see me like this.

337
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:44,755
Okay. Okay.

338
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:11,633
Bec, I don't wanna be here...

339
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:15,117
when Evan comes home.
Can you take me somewhere?

340
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:17,067
I'll pack you a bag.

341
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:20,981
No, I wanna go. Right away.

342
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,378
Katie?

343
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:20,300
So what did Miss Priss text you?

344
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:25,481
- Hey, you must be Kate.
- Miss Priss is fine.

345
00:32:25,581 --> 00:32:28,998
Kate is going to be
staying with us tonight.

346
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,789
Okay.

347
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:34,881
It's not usually like this.

348
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,798
Yeah, sometimes it's really disgusting.

349
00:32:42,447 --> 00:32:46,779
It's Evan. He's home.
He wants to know where we are.

350
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,647
Awesome.

351
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:55,014
Are you sure you're okay on the couch?

352
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:59,214
If I had a dollar for every time
I passed out there...

353
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:03,445
Just yell if you need anything.
I'm a light sleeper.

354
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:10,811
What are those?

355
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,577
Songs.

356
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:19,980
Parts, anyway.

357
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,345
A lot of beginnings. The occasional middle.
Kinda short on ends so far.

358
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:28,472
Well, is that what you wanna do?
Play music? You never mentioned it.

359
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:34,555
Probably 'cause I pretty much suck.

360
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:37,869
But, yeah, kinda, I guess.

361
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:40,512
That's what you studied in school?

362
00:33:40,612 --> 00:33:44,069
Hardly. My parents didn't even want me
to go to school in Houston.

363
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:47,045
Why are they so against it?

364
00:33:47,406 --> 00:33:49,912
Oh, I don't know.

365
00:33:50,012 --> 00:33:53,079
Probably 'cause I spent 4 years
outta high school trying

366
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:57,179
with nothing to show for it.
Except drawers of these.

367
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:01,393
You... You put music to them?

368
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:04,612
Not to this one.
Well, not that I remember, anyway.

369
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:08,489
Sometimes I write drunk.
Anyway, sleep good.

370
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:10,610
You too.

371
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:15,809
I'm sorry about Evan,

372
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:19,475
and I know you don't like cussing,

373
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,695
but he's a fucking asshole.

374
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:26,296
Night.

375
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,334
How long you been up?

376
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:52,044
- Evan called, like, 800 times.
- I have somewhere I'd like to go.

377
00:34:54,957 --> 00:34:56,014
A retirement home?

378
00:34:56,114 --> 00:34:59,591
No, it's an assisted living community
for people of all ages.

379
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:05,467
This is bullshit.

380
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:08,234
Take me in, now.

381
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:17,042
Our guest services administrator
will be just a minute.

382
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:19,909
I bet you ladies would like
some cool refreshments.

383
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:21,776
Thank you.

384
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,949
If you're not getting good enough
care with me, then fire my ass

385
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:28,342
- and find a better replacement.
- Please keep your voice down.

386
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:30,895
You think anybody in here can hear me?

387
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,642
Look, I don't exactly have a great track
record when it comes to men,

388
00:35:34,742 --> 00:35:38,174
but if this is about your husband having
an affair, why are you taking a bullet?

389
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:41,241
- Tell him to move his ass in here.
- It's my fault, not his.

390
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:43,325
That's it. That's it.

391
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:46,608
Bec, what are you doing? Bec, stop!

392
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:50,304
Honey, unless those sippy cups
are laced with tequila, we're outta here.

393
00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:54,107
I'm the one who got sick. Not him.

394
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:59,139
This isn't the life he built,
the life he deserves.

395
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:04,741
He turns me over in my sleep.
He feeds me, he bathes me.

396
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:08,241
He does everything but breathe for me.
Believe me, he'd do that if he could.

397
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:11,473
He's 37 years old.
He deserves happiness.

398
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:13,740
We all deserve some happiness.

399
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,051
What we don't all deserve...

400
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:21,884
is a little extra snatch on the side
from some skanky cooze.

401
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,007
- Last night...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

402
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:35,672
Last night, what were you doing
at the top of the stairs?

403
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,640
I just thought it'd be easier...

404
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,807
- I know what you thought.
- No, you don't.

405
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:46,833
Okay, you're right, I don't.

406
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:49,507
I don't even really know you.

407
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,674
But I'm actually starting to like you.

408
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:57,849
The only other person I ever
saw up close like this was my grammy.

409
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,284
Every Thanksgiving,

410
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,507
my redneck cousins would bet
against her lasting 'til Christmas.

411
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:06,706
And 12 years straight they lost.
Because she didn't take shit from anyone.

412
00:37:12,638 --> 00:37:15,154
Take me downtown.

413
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:25,313
Alright. I understand. On the 15th...

414
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:27,238
I gotta go. Kate.

415
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,672
Thank God you're okay.
I've been worried sick about you.

416
00:37:30,772 --> 00:37:33,939
- Where the hell have you been?
- I want you to move out.

417
00:37:34,491 --> 00:37:36,145
- What?
- She said sh...

418
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:38,570
I heard what she said.

419
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:42,731
Can you give us a minute, please?
In private.

420
00:37:43,271 --> 00:37:44,772
Thank you.

421
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:48,703
Okay.

422
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:53,188
It's not what you think,
and I'm not leaving.

423
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:56,592
- Then I will.
- What are you saying? You want a divorce?

424
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:59,104
You're divorcing me,
after everything that we've been through,

425
00:37:59,204 --> 00:38:00,971
- everything that I've...
- What?

426
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,911
Everything you've what, Evan?

427
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,404
Katie, please.

428
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:16,102
- It was a mistake. I made one mistake.
- This isn't about your mistake.

429
00:38:16,202 --> 00:38:19,741
This is about me not being able to live
one more second feeling guilty

430
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:22,770
for what I did to your life.

431
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:27,303
I can't do it anymore.
I'm not gonna... wait for you in bed.

432
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:30,303
- Katie, come on, just...
- I'm not gonna share a house with you.

433
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:34,303
- Katie, please.
- No. Bec! No. Don't touch me.

434
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:36,357
Kate, come on.

435
00:38:38,947 --> 00:38:40,403
- Hi, Cynthia.
- Hi, Kate.

436
00:38:40,503 --> 00:38:43,102
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

437
00:38:44,001 --> 00:38:46,790
Oh, and he's all yours,
you skanky cooze!

438
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,969
You alright?

439
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:10,366
I think I just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

440
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:14,898
You wanna give him a call?

441
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:19,945
No.

442
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,354
I'll be okay.

443
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:28,207
I just feel bad.
You know, she's all alone.

444
00:39:28,307 --> 00:39:30,267
What if something happens to her
during the night?

445
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,368
I just wanna say,
if I see you in a sweater set,

446
00:39:32,468 --> 00:39:36,267
I'm gonna go backwards
Texas hoodrat on her ass.

447
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:38,242
Later.

448
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:48,689
Turn it off.

449
00:40:49,332 --> 00:40:52,523
- Why?
- Please, just turn it off.

450
00:40:52,623 --> 00:40:56,648
- Is this you playing?
- Damn it, Bec, just turn it off now.

451
00:41:01,473 --> 00:41:05,288
<i>- You have one message from...
- Liam.</i>

452
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:21,164
Hey, okay.

453
00:41:21,364 --> 00:41:23,962
Shit, shit, shit.

454
00:41:24,062 --> 00:41:25,864
Okay.

455
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:28,331
Here. Drink. Drink. Hey!

456
00:41:28,431 --> 00:41:32,589
Okay, just breathe. Breathe.
Just breathe. Breathe with me. Breathe.

457
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:36,730
Hey. What do I do?
What do I do? Shit, shit.

458
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,498
<i>You contacted Emergency Alert.
Help is on the way.</i>

459
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:43,476
- Cancel.
- What? You want me to cancel?

460
00:41:47,531 --> 00:41:49,433
This is...

461
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:53,729
This is Bec Cartwell,
calling on behalf of Katherine Parker.

462
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:58,406
I accidentally triggered the alarm
and I need to cancel it.

463
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,280
Thank you.

464
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:07,029
Don't ever do that again,
without asking me.

465
00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:11,245
- Hey, I thought that you...
- I don't care.

466
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:16,064
It's my decision to make, not yours.

467
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:18,261
You understand?

468
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:21,293
Say it.

469
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:30,684
I understand.

470
00:42:35,562 --> 00:42:37,629
Hey, you.

471
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:40,477
You ever coming back to my class?

472
00:42:40,577 --> 00:42:42,629
Professor.

473
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,965
It's "professor" now?

474
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:48,303
That's not good.

475
00:42:49,129 --> 00:42:52,095
You should know you just broke
my personal record.

476
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:56,171
Most unreturned phone calls
from a former girlfriend.

477
00:42:56,396 --> 00:42:58,928
I hardly think I was ever a girlfriend.

478
00:42:59,028 --> 00:43:01,329
We could work on that.

479
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:03,904
If...

480
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:06,597
you ever call me back.

481
00:43:08,594 --> 00:43:13,927
Do you think God invented sex so we could
bear each other's shortcomings?

482
00:43:14,027 --> 00:43:17,984
Because every time we do that,
I forget all the stuff I hate about you.

483
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:21,360
I wasn't aware you hated
anything about me.

484
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:25,851
So will you quit cutting my class now?

485
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,735
Sorry.

486
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:31,027
Just a lot going on with Kate right now.

487
00:43:31,127 --> 00:43:33,001
Kate? Who's Kate?

488
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:36,160
Do you ever listen to anything I say?

489
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,627
Kate, the patient friend
I take care of.

490
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:41,626
Something funny?

491
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:44,295
You're actually responsible
for another person's life?

492
00:43:48,265 --> 00:43:50,361
Where you going?

493
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:54,993
Economists think about costs, not just
in terms of an item's monetary value,

494
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:59,409
but also the opportunity costs
of a particular item...

495
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:14,959
I'm now in the chair,
and it's harder to breathe.

496
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:18,226
My voice, too. Especially at night.

497
00:44:18,326 --> 00:44:21,525
Well, that's to be expected.
This process only moves in one direction,

498
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,534
but attitude goes a long way, Kate.

499
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,350
- So, this one, too.
- No.

500
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:31,522
- Come on.
- Yes.

501
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:35,313
No, not those.

502
00:44:41,864 --> 00:44:44,949
Alright, take 'em
before I change my mind.

503
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:47,568
Oh, my God.

504
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:52,889
I look like you.

505
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,398
Girl, go!

506
00:44:57,808 --> 00:45:01,723
This is, like, the Porsche of wheelchairs
and it's just sitting here.

507
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,418
I know. Evan bought it
for me a year ago.

508
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,857
So what's the problem?

509
00:45:11,528 --> 00:45:15,091
Riding in one of those
is like admitting I'm sick.

510
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:17,190
Which I am, so it's crazy.

511
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,689
Why don't you give it a whirl?
If you hate it, we'll throw it in the trash.

512
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:26,532
Go, girl.

513
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,509
I'm catching up. Go on.

514
00:45:34,556 --> 00:45:38,696
A little? Come on, just a little.
Give me a couple of kicks.

515
00:45:38,796 --> 00:45:41,687
There you go. Just try it.

516
00:45:44,289 --> 00:45:48,722
My husband bet you had
a spinal cord injury,

517
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:51,756
but I can spot one of my own
a mile away.

518
00:45:52,056 --> 00:45:55,553
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Yes.

519
00:45:55,659 --> 00:45:57,856
He lost.

520
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:02,319
Now he owes me the sexual favor
of my choice.

521
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,022
I'm Marilyn and this is John.

522
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:11,389
And now, in addition to other
intimate details, you also know our names.

523
00:46:11,888 --> 00:46:16,407
I'm Kate, and this is my...
This is Bec.

524
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:19,710
After this water torture,

525
00:46:20,055 --> 00:46:22,905
would you care to partake

526
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:26,098
in a little herbal therapy?

527
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:31,275
It's not the prescribed treatment
for this painful-ass disease,

528
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:35,819
but it sure does feel good.

529
00:46:51,138 --> 00:46:54,417
I'm a grown woman... taking up pot.

530
00:46:56,032 --> 00:46:58,838
Did she just say "taking up pot"?

531
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:03,841
We got ourselves a wild one here!

532
00:47:04,886 --> 00:47:07,285
I'm happy and I don't know why.

533
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,928
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- Oh, yes, I did.

534
00:47:14,987 --> 00:47:19,419
This damn illness...
It may take my arms, my legs,

535
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,475
my chest, my breathing, my heart...

536
00:47:23,918 --> 00:47:26,521
but no matter how hard it tries,

537
00:47:26,621 --> 00:47:30,385
it'll never be able
to take away my funk.

538
00:47:37,383 --> 00:47:39,206
Yeah!

539
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:41,727
That's it. Hit it, girl.

540
00:47:43,153 --> 00:47:46,472
Yeah. Go on, girl.
Come on, girl, get it.

541
00:47:49,051 --> 00:47:51,180
- You seeing this?
- Hell, yeah, I see you.

542
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,920
Shit, yeah. Yeah, you heard right.

543
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:59,185
Shit, shit, damn. Shit, damn, damn.
Shit, damn, shit, damn, damn, damn, shit.

544
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:01,337
Fuck.

545
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:05,502
We done lost her now.

546
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:25,583
Hey, Kate, it's me, Evan.

547
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:30,531
Can you please just call me back?

548
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,284
Just call me back.

549
00:48:34,384 --> 00:48:39,449
I just wanna hear your voice, alright?
Just let me know that you're okay.

550
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:55,870
Has anyone here actually met Dirty Barry?
Because I haven't and I am here a lot.

551
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,084
I'm not waiting for you, of course.
It's just I have lots of things to do.

552
00:48:59,184 --> 00:49:03,701
But I'm Wil. We spent
a night together, an evening.

553
00:49:03,801 --> 00:49:05,883
"Bill" Wil, remember? Hi.

554
00:49:05,983 --> 00:49:08,516
I remember, sort of. Hi.

555
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:10,349
Hi. I'm I'm Wil.

556
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:12,348
- Kate.
- Kate.

557
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:15,894
Are you always such a gentleman?

558
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:19,482
Oh, no. I'm actually just trying
to make a good impression

559
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,397
so you'll tell your friend
to go out with me again.

560
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:23,795
How do you know Bec?

561
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,690
Best sex of my life.

562
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,248
- Hey, okay, hi.
- And now she won't call me back.

563
00:49:29,348 --> 00:49:33,550
Shame on you, Bec. Apologize at once
and go out with this fine young man.

564
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,782
- Your friend is very wise.
- She also happens to be my boss,

565
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:41,119
so, you know, she doesn't
wanna hear about our time together.

566
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:44,083
So, are you playing tonight?

567
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:45,732
- No.
- Why not?

568
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:50,749
'Cause there's only so much failure
and humiliation a person can take.

569
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:53,408
Well, here's the thing, Bec,

570
00:49:53,508 --> 00:49:55,645
I heard you sing a couple of notes

571
00:49:55,745 --> 00:49:59,848
before you had your accident
that night that we... that we met.

572
00:49:59,948 --> 00:50:01,851
And if I can...

573
00:50:01,951 --> 00:50:05,881
name any song in three notes...
which I can, by the way...

574
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:10,748
I can name a good singer in two.
And you're a really good singer.

575
00:50:11,103 --> 00:50:12,120
So...

576
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:16,748
- So... Wil...
- No.

577
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,887
Stop.

578
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:22,581
I know what you're thinking.
He's just...

579
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:26,280
- He's not...
- What? The one?

580
00:50:27,044 --> 00:50:30,847
Trust me, from someone
who got the one, it's overrated.

581
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:34,104
Okay. It's my life to screw up
as I see fit. Okay?

582
00:50:35,513 --> 00:50:37,410
Okay.

583
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,947
But...

584
00:50:40,047 --> 00:50:42,321
he's really cute.

585
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:49,879
You know, right around the time
that I met Evan...

586
00:50:51,956 --> 00:50:56,048
there was this guy... Harwick Windsor.

587
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,956
He was a musician.

588
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:02,679
He came over to my house,

589
00:51:02,779 --> 00:51:06,864
and he stood on my porch
with a guitar...

590
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:11,844
and he played a song
that he'd written for me.

591
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:16,812
And when it was finished,

592
00:51:16,912 --> 00:51:22,577
he looked at me the way nobody
has ever looked at me.

593
00:51:28,812 --> 00:51:31,445
Why is it that...

594
00:51:31,718 --> 00:51:35,410
we want the ones that don't see us...

595
00:51:35,908 --> 00:51:38,968
instead of the ones that do?

596
00:51:50,311 --> 00:51:52,992
- Okay.
- Now lipstick.

597
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,851
- This one?
- Too loud.

598
00:51:58,176 --> 00:52:00,268
For you.

599
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:12,767
It's gonna be fine.

600
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,544
- Excuse me.
- Kate, hi.

601
00:52:21,644 --> 00:52:23,343
- You look gorgeous.
- You too.

602
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,443
- So glad you came.
- Me too.

603
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:27,443
Hey, Taylor. Come here, honey.

604
00:52:29,189 --> 00:52:30,210
Hey, Taylor.

605
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:33,827
Look at the beautiful present
that Auntie Kate brought you.

606
00:52:36,228 --> 00:52:38,677
Didn't your mommy ever teach you
it's not polite to stare?

607
00:52:38,777 --> 00:52:40,646
Bec.

608
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:44,527
So nice to see you, Kate.
How you feeling?

609
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:45,744
- Good.
- Good.

610
00:52:45,844 --> 00:52:48,210
Kate, there you are!

611
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:52,076
Hey, pretty girl,
there's someone I need you to meet.

612
00:52:53,776 --> 00:52:56,011
- Hi.
- She's beautiful.

613
00:52:56,210 --> 00:53:00,648
Say hi to your Auntie Kate. Say hi.

614
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:02,497
Can I hold her?

615
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:04,473
Okay.

616
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:13,040
There you go.

617
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,309
- She looks just like you.
- I think she looks like her daddy.

618
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:19,809
I read that, actually, babies look like
their daddies when they're born,

619
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:22,377
so their daddies don't run...

620
00:53:25,297 --> 00:53:29,176
Okay, okay, okay. I got her, I got her.

621
00:53:31,072 --> 00:53:33,038
Just breathe. Take it slow.

622
00:53:34,908 --> 00:53:37,436
- I told you this wasn't a good idea.
- Is she okay?

623
00:53:37,536 --> 00:53:40,272
Just look at me. Just breathe.

624
00:53:52,408 --> 00:53:55,128
Now we know why Kate was invited.

625
00:53:55,228 --> 00:53:56,736
I needed to see you.

626
00:53:58,049 --> 00:54:00,306
You've lost weight.

627
00:54:00,842 --> 00:54:03,627
She says you look like shit.

628
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:06,904
You've lost weight.

629
00:54:08,172 --> 00:54:12,072
Yeah. Yeah, maybe a little.

630
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:15,851
- I'm not ready to see you, Evan.
- She's not ready to see you.

631
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,260
Okay.

632
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,569
I just want you to know
I never saw her again.

633
00:54:22,669 --> 00:54:24,372
What are you looking for? A medal?

634
00:54:24,472 --> 00:54:27,639
No one gives a shit
about your sex life, Evan.

635
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:30,953
You're not you. You're me.

636
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,938
It's not about Cynthia. It never was.

637
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,940
She says it wasn't about Cynthia.
It was never about her.

638
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:51,973
- It's about being invisible.
- Feeling invisible.

639
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:57,018
- I love you.
- And she says she loves you.

640
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:01,904
- Take care of yourself.
- And to take care.

641
00:55:20,937 --> 00:55:23,307
I miss him.

642
00:55:23,968 --> 00:55:26,207
I miss... me.

643
00:55:26,307 --> 00:55:28,571
- Hey.
- Us.

644
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:30,004
Kate.

645
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:34,887
I shouldn't have asked to hold it.

646
00:55:35,303 --> 00:55:36,471
- The baby?
- Yeah.

647
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:38,805
No, the baby's fine, Kate.

648
00:55:38,905 --> 00:55:44,117
I know, but my arms.
I tried... I tried to catch her.

649
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:49,190
- Did you hear her scream?
- She wasn't screaming, she was crying.

650
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:52,402
Babies cry. That's what they do.

651
00:55:53,646 --> 00:55:56,698
I wanted a baby...

652
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,770
so bad.

653
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:05,159
I wanted to travel.

654
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:08,016
I wanted to play music.

655
00:56:08,737 --> 00:56:11,370
Now it's too late.

656
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,742
I have so much inside.

657
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:20,107
Nothing comes out.

658
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:22,670
Tell me what you want to come out.

659
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,776
I wanna... I wanna scream.

660
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:29,835
I just, I wanna...

661
00:56:29,935 --> 00:56:32,415
scream.

662
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:51,455
Do you think we'll get invited back
to the party next year?

663
00:56:58,484 --> 00:57:03,089
6 months ago, you were breathing
at a 64 per cent capacity. Now it's 43.

664
00:57:03,189 --> 00:57:05,702
Are you wearing your BiPAP at night?

665
00:57:05,802 --> 00:57:07,802
No.

666
00:57:09,334 --> 00:57:11,422
I don't like it.

667
00:57:11,522 --> 00:57:14,434
It makes me feel like I'm suffocating.

668
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:15,631
Well, look, Kate,

669
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:19,268
it's gonna get harder and harder
for you to get oxygen into your lungs.

670
00:57:19,368 --> 00:57:22,301
Soon, we'll be looking
at a permanent ventilator.

671
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:27,244
But when she's on the machine,
can she even talk?

672
00:57:42,966 --> 00:57:45,533
I never did this.

673
00:57:46,191 --> 00:57:48,235
Did what?

674
00:57:49,234 --> 00:57:51,331
Nothing.

675
00:57:53,551 --> 00:57:56,895
I think that's what's wrong
with my life.

676
00:57:57,332 --> 00:58:00,397
I didn't know this was doing nothing.

677
00:58:05,832 --> 00:58:08,466
I know you trust him and all,

678
00:58:09,165 --> 00:58:11,823
but he didn't mention even one
of the experimental drugs

679
00:58:11,923 --> 00:58:14,262
they're testing right now.

680
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:18,899
Don't do that.

681
00:58:20,676 --> 00:58:24,386
- Do what?
- What all the others do.

682
00:58:24,785 --> 00:58:27,351
Pretend.

683
00:58:36,332 --> 00:58:39,935
I know it's not my place, because...

684
00:58:40,035 --> 00:58:43,365
I'm not the one
who has this thing, but...

685
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:47,402
please don't give up.

686
00:58:51,964 --> 00:58:54,908
That's the thing about giving up.

687
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:59,777
You don't realize you've done it
until it's too late.

688
00:59:01,326 --> 00:59:03,455
Like music.

689
00:59:03,555 --> 00:59:06,560
I didn't suddenly stop.

690
00:59:08,116 --> 00:59:11,580
I started playing less and less.

691
00:59:12,279 --> 00:59:15,337
Until I wasn't playing anymore.

692
00:59:16,036 --> 00:59:19,524
And it also just didn't fit with...

693
00:59:19,624 --> 00:59:22,145
everything.

694
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,229
Evan-everything?

695
00:59:29,897 --> 00:59:32,896
Did you ever give up on something big?

696
00:59:35,264 --> 00:59:41,230
Besides life, singing, school,
pleasing my parents, love?

697
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:44,329
No, no, no.

698
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:48,022
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

699
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:51,996
So this is how it goes.

700
00:59:52,096 --> 00:59:56,595
It's Christmas at my mother's,
New Years Eve at Alyssa's,

701
00:59:56,695 --> 01:00:01,963
and a very traditional
Thanksgiving at Keely's.

702
01:00:02,063 --> 01:00:04,530
Personally, I'd rather staple my tits
to a burning building

703
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:08,954
than have Christmas
or Thanksgiving at Keely's.

704
01:00:09,054 --> 01:00:11,592
You know what?

705
01:00:12,094 --> 01:00:14,186
Me, too.

706
01:00:27,262 --> 01:00:30,361
- Honey, that's Jill's date.
- Right.

707
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:34,465
Okay.

708
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:38,621
A toast to friends...

709
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:41,073
old, new...

710
01:00:41,173 --> 01:00:45,195
- Reluctantly invited.
- My guest. Not reluctant.

711
01:00:45,595 --> 01:00:48,061
Like... I was saying...

712
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:52,503
to friends, old and new,
but most of all, to Kate.

713
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:56,746
Who's the bravest, toughest,
coolest, chick I know.

714
01:00:58,831 --> 01:01:01,987
- Thank you.
- To Kate.

715
01:01:04,323 --> 01:01:05,763
Happy Thanksgiving.

716
01:01:41,226 --> 01:01:43,872
Boy, you ain't got no game.

717
01:01:44,815 --> 01:01:47,143
Go ask her to dance.

718
01:01:49,683 --> 01:01:51,959
Would you care to dance?

719
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:57,017
Sure.

720
01:02:05,658 --> 01:02:07,738
It's Brazilian.

721
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:17,475
You ever wish you weren't just watching
moments like this?

722
01:02:17,575 --> 01:02:20,656
Oh, I'm not just watching.

723
01:02:20,956 --> 01:02:23,249
I feel it.

724
01:02:24,225 --> 01:02:28,256
Feel life more than I ever
felt it before.

725
01:02:33,058 --> 01:02:35,358
How come you never ask me
to translate for Kate?

726
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:38,957
I read lips.

727
01:02:39,057 --> 01:02:41,922
- Nice try.
- It's true.

728
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:50,088
- What's that mean?
- My older brother is deaf.

729
01:03:00,423 --> 01:03:02,257
- You just said something pervy.
- No, I didn't.

730
01:03:02,357 --> 01:03:04,489
What did you say? Come on.

731
01:03:04,589 --> 01:03:06,848
I said...

732
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:10,389
maybe one day you'll stop punishing me

733
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:14,521
for liking you as much as I do.

734
01:03:19,323 --> 01:03:21,855
I should start cleaning up.

735
01:03:36,423 --> 01:03:38,623
Surprise.

736
01:03:39,123 --> 01:03:41,955
Happy Thanksgiving

737
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:44,372
- to you...
- What are you doing here?

738
01:03:44,472 --> 01:03:47,521
- You know why I'm here.
- You're drunk.

739
01:03:47,621 --> 01:03:50,731
- Just a little bit.
- I don't wanna do this anymore.

740
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:54,515
You know, I think you say that
because you think it makes the sex hotter.

741
01:03:54,615 --> 01:03:56,298
Which it does.

742
01:04:00,321 --> 01:04:02,687
Go home, now, to your wife.

743
01:04:02,837 --> 01:04:05,255
Come on. Now. To your wife.

744
01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:09,652
Come on. I want you. I know you want me.

745
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:15,182
Oh, come on. I miss you.

746
01:05:25,086 --> 01:05:30,353
You can have... everything.

747
01:05:32,086 --> 01:05:34,610
Everything.

748
01:05:34,919 --> 01:05:39,540
Just don't let me end up
like that. Please.

749
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:44,517
I can't die in a hospital,
strapped to a machine.

750
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:59,122
I'm not condoning what he did.
It was wrong.

751
01:05:59,222 --> 01:06:03,284
- For God's sake, it's time to forgive him.
- Men cheat. It happens.

752
01:06:03,384 --> 01:06:07,317
But she didn't have to blow up his whole
life. I mean, blow up all our lives.

753
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:09,317
So, why'd you want me to come here?

754
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:12,418
You want me to apologize
for her inconveniencing you?

755
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:14,251
Okay, you clearly
don't like me very much.

756
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:16,383
Which is fine because I don't
really like you either.

757
01:06:16,483 --> 01:06:19,532
- Alyssa...
- So are you in the will yet?

758
01:06:19,632 --> 01:06:21,606
- Alyssa!
- She can't expect to come out of nowhere

759
01:06:21,706 --> 01:06:24,216
and expect people not to ask questions
about her intentions.

760
01:06:24,316 --> 01:06:26,450
- Wait.
- I mean, we were her friends first.

761
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,547
Alyssa, shut up.

762
01:06:32,917 --> 01:06:37,482
Look, just tell her that we love her.

763
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:41,161
And that we miss her.

764
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,348
And that we're here.

765
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:52,380
You will not believe what I...

766
01:06:57,315 --> 01:06:59,515
- Who's this?
- Rachel.

767
01:06:59,977 --> 01:07:02,749
I just thought maybe we could
give you a break some time.

768
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:04,889
Okay.

769
01:07:06,016 --> 01:07:08,683
- So you don't cook or clean?
- Yes, absolutely...

770
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:11,549
- Any experience with ALS?
- Not specifically...

771
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:15,916
- She's worked with disabled people.
- But not ALS?

772
01:07:16,016 --> 01:07:18,877
- No.
- We'll be in touch.

773
01:07:19,705 --> 01:07:21,149
We'll be in touch.

774
01:07:21,249 --> 01:07:24,035
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

775
01:07:26,849 --> 01:07:29,745
- I'm sorry I didn't discuss it with you.
- I get it.

776
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:32,748
- It's not to take over.
- No, I get it.

777
01:07:33,002 --> 01:07:36,280
Actually, I don't get it.
What's going on?

778
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,867
You have school...

779
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:40,998
your music.

780
01:07:42,414 --> 01:07:44,403
I'm worried I'm asking too much.

781
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:48,471
Have you ever heard me complain?
Have you? I'm fine.

782
01:08:34,179 --> 01:08:36,047
Hey.

783
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:38,377
Hi.

784
01:08:45,012 --> 01:08:47,645
So, I've...

785
01:08:47,945 --> 01:08:50,945
been thinking about us a lot.

786
01:08:53,391 --> 01:08:56,278
And I could have been more patient.

787
01:08:59,045 --> 01:09:02,312
You know, I thought that I was
at the time, but I really wasn't.

788
01:09:02,412 --> 01:09:06,578
And I'm sure there's 9,000 other things
that I could've done better, too.

789
01:09:07,816 --> 01:09:10,325
You should know...

790
01:09:10,769 --> 01:09:16,109
that it wasn't... it wasn't just sex.
Okay. It was...

791
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:18,478
I just needed...

792
01:09:18,578 --> 01:09:23,177
I just needed to... touch someone
without hurting 'em, that's all.

793
01:09:28,878 --> 01:09:31,877
But I just want you to know
that I'm sorry.

794
01:09:36,445 --> 01:09:38,538
I'm sorry.

795
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:51,411
Do you remember...
when we re-met after UT?

796
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:55,009
- Yeah. At your concert, yeah.
- And afterwards,

797
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:58,975
we went to 300 Houston
and drank Martinis.

798
01:09:59,374 --> 01:10:01,107
Yeah.

799
01:10:03,207 --> 01:10:08,801
That night, I could see in your eyes...

800
01:10:09,344 --> 01:10:11,545
that you didn't see me for who I was.

801
01:10:11,645 --> 01:10:14,430
- Kate, that's not...
- But...

802
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:16,980
then again...

803
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,824
I wanted to be the woman you saw.

804
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:26,451
So... it wasn't just you.

805
01:10:28,002 --> 01:10:29,443
We did this.

806
01:10:38,873 --> 01:10:42,394
You want me to go up and down
or around and around?

807
01:10:50,009 --> 01:10:52,168
- Hey.
- Hey.

808
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:57,152
Brace yourself. Your parents are here.

809
01:10:57,252 --> 01:10:58,776
- What the hell?
- They're outside.

810
01:10:58,876 --> 01:11:02,684
They came by the apartment
and... Merry Christmas.

811
01:11:02,784 --> 01:11:03,942
Yeah.

812
01:11:06,663 --> 01:11:09,641
- I didn't know you were coming.
- We left you 5 messages.

813
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:13,544
- Didn't you check them?
- Of course, Mom.

814
01:11:16,474 --> 01:11:18,703
Come on in.

815
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:21,444
Dad.

816
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:28,374
Wanna cut the evening short?
I can make a pass at your mom.

817
01:11:31,364 --> 01:11:34,530
- This is Kate.
- Merry Christmas.

818
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,948
I'm Elizabeth...

819
01:11:38,472 --> 01:11:40,488
and this is Bruce.

820
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:42,640
Nice to meet you.

821
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,740
Would you like to stay for dinner?

822
01:11:46,884 --> 01:11:49,784
She wants to know if you want
to stay for dinner?

823
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,607
Thank you. I'm sure
I can whip something up.

824
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,006
I got it.

825
01:11:57,106 --> 01:12:01,392
Oh, that's right. I cook now, Mom.
Lasagna's in the oven.

826
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,544
So, are you actually living here now?

827
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,790
Your wife sounds like Bec.

828
01:12:25,589 --> 01:12:27,481
What's in the back?

829
01:12:27,672 --> 01:12:31,938
Your wife's voice sounds like Bec.

830
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:36,336
One... One more time.

831
01:12:36,473 --> 01:12:39,255
When your father and I
didn't hear from you

832
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:43,038
for a couple of weeks... and I didn't get
a tuition bill for a couple of months...

833
01:12:43,138 --> 01:12:46,971
- Can we talk about this another time?
- I decided to finally call the college.

834
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:49,872
- I was gonna call you.
- Oh, really? When were you gonna call me,

835
01:12:50,271 --> 01:12:53,388
<i>and let me know
that you had decided to drop out?</i>

836
01:12:54,251 --> 01:12:56,638
No. Leave it.

837
01:12:56,738 --> 01:12:59,199
<i>- I'm just taking some time off.
- Rebecca,</i>

838
01:12:59,299 --> 01:13:03,471
you spend more time taking time off than
you do in college. What are you doing here?

839
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:07,638
If you're actually asking me a question,
I'd be happy to answer it.

840
01:13:07,838 --> 01:13:11,394
<i>But if this is just another one of your ways
to put me down, by all means...</i>

841
01:13:12,485 --> 01:13:13,901
Answer it.

842
01:13:15,264 --> 01:13:17,953
I'm doing something...

843
01:13:18,053 --> 01:13:20,357
positive.

844
01:13:20,457 --> 01:13:24,371
Something good.
I'm helping another human being.

845
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:26,604
No, Rebecca, my darling, you're not.

846
01:13:26,704 --> 01:13:29,971
What you are doing is exactly
what you've done your entire life.

847
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:33,012
You're focusing all of your energy,

848
01:13:33,112 --> 01:13:37,470
all of your time, on something
that is doomed to fail.

849
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:40,996
That poor, poor woman
out there is going to die.

850
01:13:41,596 --> 01:13:45,935
And when she is gone,
where does that leave you?

851
01:13:46,085 --> 01:13:49,227
With no future, no degree,

852
01:13:49,327 --> 01:13:53,979
and no means of supporting yourself.

853
01:13:54,673 --> 01:13:56,761
Nothing.

854
01:14:02,969 --> 01:14:05,336
Merry Christmas to you, too, Mom.

855
01:14:06,156 --> 01:14:09,716
Come back in here, Rebecca.
I am not done talking to you.

856
01:14:09,816 --> 01:14:13,134
- <i>Rebecca, you come back in here.</i>
- Shit.

857
01:14:22,436 --> 01:14:25,085
Why didn't you tell me you dropped out?

858
01:14:25,185 --> 01:14:29,236
Please, Kate, I've already had,
and lost, this fight once today.

859
01:14:29,336 --> 01:14:31,002
Your mother is right.

860
01:14:31,102 --> 01:14:34,802
My mother has never been right
about anything in my entire life.

861
01:14:34,902 --> 01:14:37,268
- I am going to die.
- With that attitude.

862
01:14:37,368 --> 01:14:40,635
It's not an attitude, Bec. It's a fact.

863
01:14:41,034 --> 01:14:42,934
There are experimental drugs.

864
01:14:43,034 --> 01:14:45,255
- If your doctor would...
- I want you to move out.

865
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:52,533
That's ridiculous.

866
01:14:53,979 --> 01:14:56,926
- Who's gonna take care of you?
- I'll call my mother.

867
01:14:57,026 --> 01:14:58,634
Your mother who lives an hour away,

868
01:14:58,734 --> 01:15:01,200
who hasn't been here to visit you
once since I've been here?

869
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:04,900
I'm not gonna let someone else
ruin their life because of my illness.

870
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,766
I didn't tell you
about school because...

871
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:10,818
Like you didn't tell me about having
an affair with a married professor.

872
01:15:12,344 --> 01:15:13,970
You've been damning Evan.

873
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,867
What's the difference
between you and Cynthia?

874
01:15:16,967 --> 01:15:19,998
I'm dying and his wife isn't?

875
01:15:24,067 --> 01:15:26,300
Fuck you.

876
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,011
Fuck you.

877
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:34,823
You wanna die, and you know I won't
let you, and that's what this is about.

878
01:15:35,475 --> 01:15:37,984
I'm outta here.

879
01:15:56,633 --> 01:15:59,727
Look at you.

880
01:16:00,231 --> 01:16:02,310
My family's home.

881
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,466
Hi, Gwen.

882
01:16:04,865 --> 01:16:07,167
Oh, darlin'.

883
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:08,992
You know,
I always preferred your hair up.

884
01:16:09,092 --> 01:16:11,865
I'm gonna send my hairdresser over
in a little while. Okay?

885
01:16:11,965 --> 01:16:14,832
It'll give you such confidence.

886
01:16:15,265 --> 01:16:18,565
Now, how come y'all
haven't opened your presents?

887
01:16:18,665 --> 01:16:22,202
- What in the world is going on here?
- Here, Gwen, let me help.

888
01:16:22,302 --> 01:16:26,900
Oh, here, I got you something special.

889
01:16:31,998 --> 01:16:34,507
Merry Christmas, darlin'.

890
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:47,313
And you remember Evan?

891
01:16:48,075 --> 01:16:49,040
Hi.

892
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:51,761
- Enjoy the bar.
- Sure.

893
01:16:53,418 --> 01:16:55,476
I've got somebody for you to meet.

894
01:17:05,631 --> 01:17:10,006
There's the belle of the ball,
and my favorite niece.

895
01:17:10,412 --> 01:17:14,483
First things first. Inoculation.

896
01:17:19,429 --> 01:17:23,065
I've done too many of these
Christmas parties without you.

897
01:17:23,821 --> 01:17:26,148
Having fun yet?

898
01:17:27,667 --> 01:17:30,194
Over the moon.

899
01:17:39,795 --> 01:17:43,926
"I told you,
it was a 'Yankee doodle dandy'."

900
01:17:46,977 --> 01:17:47,993
Christmas cheer.

901
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:54,643
Bec.

902
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,303
Hi.

903
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:01,902
Hi.

904
01:18:04,502 --> 01:18:07,305
Are you playing tonight?

905
01:18:10,462 --> 01:18:13,023
Not feeling very musical.

906
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:15,789
How's Kate?

907
01:18:18,154 --> 01:18:20,279
I wouldn't know.

908
01:18:20,379 --> 01:18:22,595
She kinda fired me.

909
01:18:22,695 --> 01:18:26,532
Or broke up with me.
I'm not really sure which.

910
01:18:27,227 --> 01:18:29,760
Turns out it's no different
than breaking up with a guy.

911
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:34,759
You still torture yourself listening to
their music and going to their weird places.

912
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,156
You never called me back.

913
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,394
It's complicated.

914
01:18:43,977 --> 01:18:45,191
It's complicated.

915
01:18:48,776 --> 01:18:52,206
Out of curiosity, if...

916
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:55,880
If I was to be...

917
01:18:55,980 --> 01:19:00,080
dumb enough to ask you out on a date,

918
01:19:01,926 --> 01:19:04,987
would I stand a chance?

919
01:19:07,893 --> 01:19:09,991
I'm just not...

920
01:19:11,475 --> 01:19:13,686
Alright, okay.

921
01:19:13,786 --> 01:19:17,233
Say hi to Kate... or...
I'm sorry about...

922
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:20,958
you getting fired. She was cool.

923
01:19:23,526 --> 01:19:25,526
Wil!

924
01:19:28,301 --> 01:19:32,087
I'm thinking one day I might
come to my senses, so...

925
01:19:34,758 --> 01:19:37,823
don't lose my number. Okay?

926
01:19:46,265 --> 01:19:48,141
Hello?

927
01:20:09,474 --> 01:20:13,739
Hey. I'm here to see Kate.

928
01:20:37,154 --> 01:20:38,957
Progress.

929
01:20:39,257 --> 01:20:43,632
- How you doing, Bec?
- Our friend Marilyn died.

930
01:20:43,946 --> 01:20:46,907
Oh. I'm sorry to hear about that.

931
01:20:50,052 --> 01:20:52,793
I thought Kate should know. Wasn't something
I wanted to tell her on the phone.

932
01:20:52,993 --> 01:20:55,956
Yeah, of course.

933
01:20:56,056 --> 01:20:57,756
Will you tell her about Marilyn?

934
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:01,472
I'm not sure
that's the best idea right now.

935
01:21:02,389 --> 01:21:05,655
This is a copy of the letter
that Marilyn's husband

936
01:21:05,755 --> 01:21:07,769
sent all of her friends when she died.

937
01:21:11,123 --> 01:21:13,717
Kate'll wanna hear it.

938
01:21:25,889 --> 01:21:30,796
"Marilyn called herself
the black Lou Gehrig.

939
01:21:31,308 --> 01:21:34,038
Most of you know what that means.

940
01:21:34,138 --> 01:21:38,286
But some of Marilyn's younger friends
might appreciate knowing that Lou Gehrig

941
01:21:38,386 --> 01:21:40,787
was a baseball player
for the New York Yankees."

942
01:21:40,887 --> 01:21:45,205
He played in a record
2,130 straight games,

943
01:21:45,305 --> 01:21:48,088
over 17 seasons,
until ALS forced him to retire.

944
01:21:48,188 --> 01:21:51,431
"He bid farewell to his fans
and teammates by saying,

945
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:55,217
'I consider myself the luckiest man
on the face of the earth.'

946
01:21:55,654 --> 01:21:58,421
What he meant was that although adversity
had weakened his body,

947
01:21:58,521 --> 01:22:01,988
it had strengthened his connection
to those around him.

948
01:22:02,088 --> 01:22:05,570
- To sound like anyone you know?"
- In Marilyn's final years,

949
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:10,886
she developed bonds with more
people than I can count.

950
01:22:12,571 --> 01:22:14,820
We were married...

951
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:19,383
44 wonderful years.

952
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:24,948
"But we were never closer
than we were during those final four.

953
01:22:27,386 --> 01:22:30,331
So pardon me for saying
that I too feel like the luckiest man

954
01:22:30,431 --> 01:22:32,580
on the face of the earth."

955
01:23:44,784 --> 01:23:47,051
"In the event I am not capable
of giving you full consent,

956
01:23:47,151 --> 01:23:49,117
I designate and appoint
the person listed below

957
01:23:49,217 --> 01:23:51,118
as my attorney-in-fact
for all healthcare decisions."

958
01:23:51,218 --> 01:23:54,951
- Why the hell didn't you say no?
- She asked for my help and I gave it.

959
01:23:55,051 --> 01:23:57,551
How can Evan not have medical power
of attorney? He's her husband.

960
01:23:57,651 --> 01:24:01,717
- He's her attorney husband.
- She can give it to whomever she wants.

961
01:24:03,536 --> 01:24:06,155
- Did you know about this?
- I just got off the phone with a judge,

962
01:24:06,255 --> 01:24:09,684
and he said that whenever a patient's health
takes a turn for the worse,

963
01:24:09,784 --> 01:24:12,650
changes like this... last-minute changes...
don't usually hold up.

964
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,483
- Then it's settled.
- No, it's not settled.

965
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,551
It's not what Kate wants.
Legally, yes, you're right.

966
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:20,671
- No, she goes on a ventilator now.
- Evan?

967
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:27,409
Look, I'm sorry, Gwen.

968
01:24:27,509 --> 01:24:29,816
I know that you're upset, but we have
to honor what she wants to do.

969
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:32,015
We have to honor what she wants to do.

970
01:24:32,115 --> 01:24:34,248
You heard what the doctor said, honey.

971
01:24:34,348 --> 01:24:37,049
If she don't do this now,
we may not see her tomorrow.

972
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:41,213
I know. I know.

973
01:24:41,513 --> 01:24:43,545
I know.

974
01:24:49,065 --> 01:24:51,748
- When did she come in?
- Earlier tonight.

975
01:24:51,848 --> 01:24:53,682
Did they ventilate her?
She didn't want that.

976
01:24:53,782 --> 01:24:56,231
Not yet. They wanna talk to you first.

977
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:59,366
Alright. She left it up to you.

978
01:24:59,866 --> 01:25:01,672
Me?

979
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:11,822
What did you do? What've you done?

980
01:26:12,869 --> 01:26:16,719
I told the doctor...
she wants to go home.

981
01:26:17,247 --> 01:26:19,714
And you'll put her on a ventilator?

982
01:26:20,513 --> 01:26:24,635
- That's not what she wants.
- Don't you tell me what my daughter wants.

983
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:30,845
How dare you? She is my daughter.

984
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,346
Ma'am...

985
01:26:38,712 --> 01:26:42,709
Please... don't do this.

986
01:26:43,348 --> 01:26:46,441
Don't take her from us.

987
01:26:47,257 --> 01:26:49,879
I'm not taking her from you.

988
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:53,030
I'm just taking her home.

989
01:30:21,706 --> 01:30:24,327
I can't do it.

990
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:29,605
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

991
01:30:29,705 --> 01:30:32,573
I can't sit here and watch her die.

992
01:30:46,937 --> 01:30:50,001
I love you so much.

993
01:31:30,703 --> 01:31:33,713
She put me in plaid.

994
01:31:35,193 --> 01:31:37,082
What?

995
01:31:44,136 --> 01:31:47,830
If ALS didn't kill me...

996
01:31:48,309 --> 01:31:50,878
plaid would.

997
01:32:07,035 --> 01:32:09,035
Don't...

998
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:13,806
come back in here tonight.

999
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:26,064
Don't call for help.

1000
01:32:36,601 --> 01:32:41,301
- Also promise...
- That's a lot of promises.

1001
01:32:47,301 --> 01:32:50,705
Find someone...

1002
01:32:52,062 --> 01:32:53,900
who...

1003
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:57,214
sees you.

1004
01:32:59,501 --> 01:33:00,877
Someone who sees me?

1005
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,952
You...

1006
01:33:09,052 --> 01:33:12,916
let... him...

1007
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,735
see the person I see.

1008
01:33:21,133 --> 01:33:23,798
The person you see.

1009
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:25,932
Yeah.

1010
01:33:27,594 --> 01:33:32,079
Okay, now you gotta
promise me something.

1011
01:33:33,376 --> 01:33:36,529
I'm gonna pay you a compliment...

1012
01:33:36,898 --> 01:33:39,498
and you just gotta
lay there and take it.

1013
01:33:45,532 --> 01:33:48,772
Thanks for the Manolos...

1014
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:53,256
and for teaching me how to cook.

1015
01:33:56,332 --> 01:33:58,161
But the biggest thing...

1016
01:33:58,999 --> 01:34:02,198
that I have to thank you for...

1017
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:06,664
is that you didn't let me fuck this up.

1018
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:12,702
Because no one in my life
has ever done that for me.

1019
01:34:34,163 --> 01:34:36,257
Go now.

1020
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:43,720
Go on.

1021
01:37:26,624 --> 01:37:33,025
<i>Finally I'm laying down these arms</i>

1022
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:38,324
<i>The ones I held so close
to see me through</i>

1023
01:37:38,424 --> 01:37:42,947

1024
01:37:43,047 --> 01:37:48,003

1025
01:37:48,558 --> 01:37:53,625

I don't look back, I just keep swimming</i>

1026
01:37:53,725 --> 01:37:58,657
<i>I trip and fall, I hit the ground,
I skin my knees, I just keep going</i>

1027
01:37:58,757 --> 01:38:03,724
<i>I made a mess, I've been a mess, I guess
And guess what... life is messy</i>

1028
01:38:03,824 --> 01:38:06,988
<i>And if I learned anything</i>

1029
01:38:08,894 --> 01:38:12,468

1031
