1
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:44,140
Our holiday home, Summer 1978

2
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:48,686
Look here. Here into the camera.

3
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:54,442
Hands off!

4
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:01,407
Alex, hold on!
- Dad, help me!

5
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:25,740
Slowly, cautiously,
almost gently...

6
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:31,329
the giant colossus...
is placed on the launch site.

7
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:35,208
Here on the launch site
the result of the great...

8
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,212
community work is demonstrated.
If you want an example to emphasize the famous word:

9
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,089
everyone supplies quality to everyone...
- There he is!

10
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:43,383
everyone supplies quality to everyone...
- There he is!

11
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:46,260
... here it can be seen in perfection.

12
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:52,517
I report: I am ready for the flight
with spaceship SOJUS 31...

13
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:56,687
as a member of the international
crew.

14
00:02:56,813 --> 00:03:00,107
On August 26, 1978,
we had reached international standing.

15
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:07,448
Sigmund Jähn, citizen of the GDR,
was the first German who ever went into space.

16
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:10,284
However, on this day our
family went really up in smoke.

17
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:12,203
This is your husband's third stay
in a capitalistic country.

18
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:14,205
This is your husband's third stay
in a capitalistic country.

19
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:17,249
He stands in for his boss, professor Klinger.

20
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:21,253
Do you know of any contacts in the West
your husband might have?. - No.

21
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:25,925
Mrs Kerner, how would you
describe the state of your marriage?

22
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:31,180
Has your husband ever talked to you
about escape from the Republic?

23
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:35,100
Mrs Kerner...
Has he talked to you about that?

24
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,232
Allow me to present the Central Committee
of the communist party...

25
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:46,111
Get lost! Leave me alone!

26
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:51,617
While Sigmund Jähn bravely represented the GDR
in the depths of space,

27
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:55,579
my procreator let a class enemy
in a capitalistic country...

28
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,957
screw his brains out.
He never came back.

29
00:03:58,957 --> 00:03:59,249
screw his brains out.
He never came back.

30
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:05,839
My mother became so sad,
that she stopped talking.

31
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:10,468
She just didn't talk anymore.
Not to us, not to others.

32
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:22,814
Mum, please come back.
It's so boring at Mrs. Schäfer's.

33
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:27,610
Mum, I love you.

34
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:44,168
The Sandman excellently adapted to the
conditions in space.

35
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:48,214
But the biggest surprise was that he
became very well acquainted...

36
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:51,134
...with Mascha.

37
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:54,011
We even had a cosmic
marriage on board.

38
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,388
We even had a cosmic
marriage on board.

39
00:04:55,388 --> 00:05:00,685
In a few minutes, the sandman
and Mascha will come back to Earth.

40
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:05,940
I hope it was relayed,
so that you could see it clearly.

41
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:11,195
Mother came back after 8 weeks.
It was as if she had been transformed.

42
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:14,240
Surprise!
- My sweeties!

43
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:22,706
My Alex. My little cosmonaut.

44
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:43,936
(Caption) Pioneer Park, Spring 1979
- We never talked about father again.

45
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:46,271
(Caption) Pioneer Park, Spring 1979
- We never talked about father again.

46
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:52,027
From this moment on, my mother got married
to our socialist Fatherland.

47
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:58,200
Our home...

48
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:02,245
is not only
the towns and villages...

49
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:06,249
As this relation was not a sexual one,
there was a lot of vigour and energy left...

50
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:10,211
for us kids
and the socialist daily routine.

51
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:15,717
... is the grass on the sward,
the corn on the field and the birds...

52
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:17,010
in the air and the animals on the ground...

53
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,387
in the air and the animals on the ground...

54
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:23,224
My mother became promoter of
the progress of society.

55
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:27,562
A passionate activist for the
simple needs of the people

56
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:28,980
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

57
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,523
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

58
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,858
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

59
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,236
Concerning: Gaudily colourful...

60
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:38,114
maternity dresses. Full-stop.

61
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:47,206
And now a report on the solemn honouring...
- This is it!

62
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,040
Blue- and and white-collar workers,
scientists and joint farmers,

63
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,085
Blue- and and white-collar workers,
scientists and joint farmers,

64
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:54,922
artists and veteran workers
came to Berlin today,

65
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:59,719
to receive the highest honourings
of our country in the Council of State.

66
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,428
to receive the highest honourings
of our country.

67
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:03,264
That's you, Mum!

68
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:07,309
... and recognition of outstanding
merits during the building up...

69
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,564
and development
of the socialist social order.

70
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:15,568
On the eve of the
national holiday...

71
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:19,613
the CC of the SUG
traditionally rewards men and women of merit.

72
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:25,160
After a long, untiring training
it was time. I, Alex Kerner,

73
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,456
was the second German to go to space.
Deeper and further than any man before.

74
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:32,334
Rocket launched!

75
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:37,673
I imaged how I would explore the riddles of the cosmos
for the good of humanity,

76
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:41,677
how I would look down to our planet
and how I would proudly wave to my mother.

77
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:43,387
how I would look down to our planet
and how I would proudly wave to my mother.

78
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,806
Rocket launched!

79
00:08:04,324 --> 00:08:07,911
10 years later - October 7, 1989.

80
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,373
Test, one, two...

81
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:14,167
The GDR had its 40th anniversary.

82
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,213
I had a day off with the
PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"...

83
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:22,842
and felt as if I was on the climax of
my male personal magnetism.

84
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:24,177
and felt as if I was on the climax of
my male personal magnetism.

85
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,021
Left, two, three!

86
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:39,066
Time smelt of change,
while an oversized rifle association...

87
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:44,363
had its last performance
in front of our house.

88
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,294
Alex!

89
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:01,839
What?

90
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:04,258
Alex, there's a lass out there.
Should I send her away?

91
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:06,427
Alex, there's a lass out there.
Should I send her away?

92
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:09,305
Who is she?
- No idea.

93
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:12,182
But she makes a good impression.

94
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:18,689
Have you slept in your clothes again?

95
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:21,191
Where's the visitor?

96
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:25,195
The visitor's name is Paula...
and it's a date, as agreed. Here you are.

97
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:28,115
Oh no!
- Oh yes, little brother.

98
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:32,619
Can't your ex-boyfriend take care of her?
- He's on standby duty today.

99
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:51,054
We stopped at: ...but a woman
of a certain age...

100
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:52,889
We stopped at: ...but a woman
of a certain age...

101
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:58,311
... can't and won't wear the panties,
that are offered.

102
00:09:58,353 --> 00:10:02,983
Fullstop. Even in the GDR, there
are not only young princesses on ice and...

103
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:07,028
exquisitly slim comrades. Full-stop.
- That's good.

104
00:10:07,237 --> 00:10:08,613
You're not downstairs? It's already started.
- Impossible to overhear!

105
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:11,241
You're not downstairs? It's already started.
- Impossible to overhear!

106
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:15,078
Well hurry up then. It could be the last time
with these members.

107
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:18,414
Where's Paula?
- Yeah, where is she? Sleeping again?

108
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:20,333
Maybe I'll see your
mother on TV. - In the palace?

109
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,877
Maybe I'll see your
mother on TV. - In the palace?

110
00:10:23,628 --> 00:10:26,631
You'll have to look for her with a magnifying glass.

111
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:32,678
I don't really know if I'll go there.
All of the party's bigwigs are there.

112
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,642
I don't know anyone. Although... I'd like
to see Gorbatschow at close range this once.

113
00:10:39,227 --> 00:10:43,189
There they are celebrating themselves,
all the old bastards.

114
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,276
Well you don't have to watch.
- Mum, don't you notice what's happening there?

115
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:50,321
And you, what do you want? Do a bunk?

116
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:55,701
Nothing will change if
they all go away. Let's go on.

117
00:10:56,535 --> 00:11:01,165
It cannot be possible,
that the stouter...

118
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:05,210
...workers and farmer's wifes...
are punished by the fashion combinates...

119
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:09,173
...after the 40th year of the existence
of our Republic!

120
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:12,092
With socalist salutations...

121
00:11:12,217 --> 00:11:14,845
Hanna Schäfer.

122
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:27,065
In the evening of October 7, 1989
several hundred people united...

123
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:30,902
for an evening walk,
to promote...

124
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:34,740
the idea of walking without borders.

125
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,201
Freedom of the press! Freedom of the press!

126
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:02,600
Cough! Cough hard!

127
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,312
Everything alright?

128
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:11,526
You alright?
- Thank you!

129
00:12:22,245 --> 00:12:25,832
There're even more Greens.

130
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,668
Alright already!

131
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:34,090
Form a chain!

132
00:12:34,215 --> 00:12:37,426
No violence! No violence!

133
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:44,558
You might make it
if you take the subway.

134
00:12:55,611 --> 00:12:57,655
What's your name?

135
00:12:57,696 --> 00:12:59,281
La...

136
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:39,654
Stop it!

137
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:42,324
Watch out!

138
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:03,928
That's my mum lying there!
- Stand still! - My mum's lying there!

139
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:20,319
Let me go, you asshole!
That's my mu......

140
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,809
Alexander Kerner?
- Yes?

141
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,608
Your mother.

142
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,454
What about mother?

143
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,293
What is it?

144
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,504
Mum had a heart attack.

145
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:09,594
Unfortunately, the resuscitation attempts were carried out
very late. Your mother's in a coma.

146
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:16,809
When can we talk to her?
- Alex, Mum's in a coma!

147
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:21,898
Mr. Kerner, we don't know yet,
whether or not your mother will ever wake up again.

148
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,889
Can you hear me, Mum?

149
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,476
You've got to wake up!

150
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,522
But mother was fast asleep.
In her deep, neverending sleep...

151
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:07,568
she circled like a satellite
around the events happening...

152
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:12,823
on our little planet
in our even smaller Republic.

153
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:18,912
The 9th Convention agreed to Honecker's request,
to relieve him of his duties...

154
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:23,708
because of health problems
and thanked him for his political life's work.

155
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,127
Congratulations!

156
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,087
Her sleep obscured the retirement of
the esteemed comrade Erich Honecker,

157
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,381
Her sleep obscured the retirement of
the esteemed comrade Erich Honecker,

158
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:35,095
General Secretary of the CC of the SUG
and Chairman of the GDR's council of state.

159
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,810
(Reporter) Berlin.
This evening the Wall fell.

160
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,187
(German National Anthem) Unity and Justice
and Liberty...

161
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:46,272
(German National Anthem) Unity and Justice
and Liberty...

162
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:51,611
Mother slept through a classical concert
at the City Hall of Schöneberg.

163
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:56,366
And the start of a gigantic and
unique waste collection.

164
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:56,908
And the start of a gigantic and
unique waste collection.

165
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:04,415
Open the gateway!

166
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:07,877
Stasi begone! Stasi begone!

167
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:10,755
Mother kept on sleeping. Deeply and firmly.

168
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:16,010
She missed my
first trip into the West,

169
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:20,473
and how some comrades conscientiously
protected us workers and peasants.

170
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:22,266
and how some comrades conscientiously
protected us workers and peasants.

171
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:26,103
Of course she also missed my
first cultural discoveries

172
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,981
in a new country.

173
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:32,359
Excuse me, excuse me.

174
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,194
Excuse me, excuse me.

175
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:39,950
Mothers deep sleep didn't allow her
to participate in the first free polling.

176
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:43,871
Helmut! Helmut! Helmut!

177
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:48,167
She missed how Ariane gave up her study
of economic theory...

178
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:51,045
Enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing Burger King.

179
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:55,174
... and made her first practical experience
with the circulation of money.

180
00:18:55,215 --> 00:19:00,179
The sleep saved her the moving-in of Ariane's new boyfriend.
Rainer, class enemy and barbecue man.

181
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,265
The furniture from the bedroom
is going to the basement.

182
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:05,934
The furniture from the bedroom
is going to the basement.

183
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:09,771
She missed the increasing Westernization of
our 79-square-metre apartment...

184
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:14,109
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste, okay?

185
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:14,609
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste, okay?

186
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:23,243
... and Rainer's enthusiasm for the
oriental customs and way of life.

187
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:30,166
The big hormanal ecstasy
that I experienced watching

188
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:34,212
a few beautiful legs,
didn't reach into her night.

189
00:19:43,388 --> 00:19:45,181
Shit!

190
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:55,191
What're you doing there?
- I... the infusion...

191
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:59,404
And not even the first day of Nurse Lara
exchange angel from the sovjet union,

192
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,573
penetrated her black dreams.

193
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:08,329
There you are again.
- Hello.

194
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:15,628
I was worried about you.
- They've put me in clink.

195
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:33,229
Mother overslept the triumph of
the capitalism. - Relief!

196
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:44,823
And the coordination of
my hospital visits.

197
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:11,641
Do you know what I noticed?
When she's in a good mood,

198
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:16,980
she's carrying her hair loosely.
When she's in a bad mood, she puts them up.

199
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:21,026
And during the doctor's round,
she chews on her fingernails.

200
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:28,199
Don't you think
she's got a beautiful smile?

201
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:32,454
Her sleep ignored,
how heroes of work became unemployed.

202
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:35,123
Her sleep ignored,
how heroes of work became unemployed.

203
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:39,002
The PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"
was winded up.

204
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:43,298
I was the last one
and I switched off the light.

205
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:47,677
Then there was the reprise. As a member of the
quick-witted East-West-Team, I applied the reunification very early.

206
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:51,681
Satellite dishes blossomed
in our landscape.

207
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:54,183
Denis Domaschke?

208
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:57,228
Domaschke. Denis Domaschke.

209
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:02,984
Alexander Kerner?
- Here.

210
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:05,403
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

211
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:06,195
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

212
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:07,822
Hi.

213
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:11,492
And get along, guys.

214
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:14,620
Hi.
- Hello.

215
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:22,837
Knut Vogel?

216
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:30,177
Hello, Mum. Doctor Wagner said
we should talk to you.

217
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:34,181
And if I can't be there in person,
I thought it might work like this too.

218
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:38,185
It's 5 o' clock now.
Most of the doctors are gone

219
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:42,189
and you've finally got some peace.
Nurse Lara, who's washed you,

220
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:46,193
should be gone too. If you could see her
you'd surely wake up.

221
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:51,156
Ariane sends you her regards,
she thinks the idea with the tape is nonsense. Well, you know her.

222
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,160
She's just in the room taking care of Paula who's
getting her teeths and is screaming all the time.

223
00:22:55,202 --> 00:22:59,164
Mother overslept my
unstoppable progress with Lara.

224
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:05,170
Our first romantic rendez-vous followed
4 early shifts and 35 late shifts.

225
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,777
It's loud here!

226
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:49,589
Our Russian teacher came from Minsk
and weighed a ton.

227
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,593
And that's all you know
about Russian women?

228
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:03,436
The wind of change blew
into the ruins of our Republic.

229
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:07,440
Summer came and Berlin was
the most beautiful place on Earth.

230
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,402
We felt like
being in the center of the world.

231
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:15,906
Where finally something moved.
And we moved with it.

232
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:19,827
It's too bad she doesn't
realize any of this.

233
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:24,164
Well, maybe it's better that way.
Everything she believed in

234
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:27,167
has dissolved into air in a few months.
Just like that.

235
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:30,087
And your dad?
- He was a Doctor.

236
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:35,926
He escaped into the West.
We haven't heard anything from him again.

237
00:25:17,217 --> 00:25:21,805
The future was in our hands,
uncertain and promising.

238
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:33,024
Good afternoon. We're X TV and we just wanted to...

239
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:36,653
Hello, do you need a satellite dish?

240
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:39,238
No money?

241
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:41,324
Good afternoon!

242
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:44,619
Do you like football? Then we've got something for you.

243
00:25:45,203 --> 00:25:48,080
Good afternoon. We're X TV and...

244
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:52,084
We're X TV!
Are you interested in a satellite dish?

245
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:56,172
This is Vietnam 1, there's Vietnam 2
and back there's the Viatnamese sport channel.

246
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:57,840
Alright!

247
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:06,557
To the World Cup!
- To the future! - To us!

248
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,726
Comrade!

249
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:21,572
At the moment this is just running
on the side.

250
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:27,453
And later...
I'll do real feature films.

251
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,709
Same label of course.

252
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,127
Watch this, I'll just show you something.

253
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,795
Watch this, I'll just show you something.

254
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:42,593
That's what I'm working on at the moment. Watch this!

255
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:47,806
Don't look yet.
Don't look yet, wait...

256
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:51,685
And... now!

257
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,911
Recognized it?

258
00:27:21,714 --> 00:27:23,508
Now!

259
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:31,683
That's the famous cut from 2001,
the one with the bone.

260
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:34,727
The cake represents the spaceship.

261
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:42,276
Got it now? Yes?
- Ingenious.

262
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:55,706
Ingenious.

263
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,837
Alright, everybody laugh.

264
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:03,464
Alright, everybody laugh.

265
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:08,260
At the beginning of June 1990, the borders
of our GDR were worthless.

266
00:28:12,723 --> 00:28:17,227
Mother kept on sleeping. But I
remembered the old words of the comrades:

267
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:21,231
"We solve problems by making headway"
and I acted.

268
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,184
Mum?

269
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,353
Mum!

270
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:04,899
Can you hear me?

271
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:14,909
Your mother's awakening is a wonder.
But she might not be the same person she used to be.

272
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:17,453
What do you mean?

273
00:29:17,495 --> 00:29:21,541
There have been some cases in which
the patients didn't recognize their own children: amnesia.

274
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:24,168
Loss of memory.

275
00:29:24,627 --> 00:29:26,587
Sorry.

276
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:31,175
Mental confusion. Blending of
long and short-term memory...

277
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:35,179
Taste and smell irritations,
delayed perception. We don't know,

278
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:40,643
how badly the brain was damaged.
There are a lot of uncertain possibilities.

279
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:46,482
I'm sorry to have to say this,
but mother is still in great danger.

280
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:52,154
I'm afraid I can't give you much hope
that she'll survive the next few weeks.

281
00:29:59,703 --> 00:30:01,497
Well...

282
00:30:03,207 --> 00:30:06,961
Can we take...
her home with us?

283
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:10,714
Out of the question.
She is in very good hands here.

284
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:15,177
It's also simpler for you.
She can't take another heart attack.

285
00:30:15,219 --> 00:30:19,223
You have to keep your mother
away from any excitement, even any danger of excitement.

286
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:23,560
And I mean
any form of excitement, Mr. Kerner!

287
00:30:23,602 --> 00:30:26,188
Any excitement.

288
00:30:27,231 --> 00:30:30,108
It's life-threatening.

289
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:32,194
And this?

290
00:30:32,194 --> 00:30:34,154
And this?

291
00:30:34,154 --> 00:30:37,074
Isn't this a reason to get upset?

292
00:30:37,074 --> 00:30:41,370
My mother doesn't know anything about the Fall of the Wall.
She'll find out about that here immediately.

293
00:30:44,873 --> 00:30:45,207
Your granddaughter.

294
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:47,626
Your granddaughter.

295
00:30:47,626 --> 00:30:50,003
Mummy.

296
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,218
What's happened?
- You collapsed.

297
00:30:57,218 --> 00:30:57,844
What's happened?
- You collapsed.

298
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:01,348
8 months ago.

299
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:04,434
8... months ago?

300
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:10,648
I can't... remember.

301
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:15,403
That's normal. It will come back to you.
You just have to have patience.

302
00:31:15,445 --> 00:31:18,323
And what... what happened?

303
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:23,536
Well, that was...
- It was October.

304
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:27,040
I think you wanted to go shopping.

305
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:31,169
And... there was a big queue in
front of the store. And it was so hot,

306
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,797
you just collapsed.
- In October?

307
00:31:35,631 --> 00:31:39,594
It was a really hot October.
Back then.

308
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:42,054
Yes.

309
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,473
And then?

310
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:48,102
You were in a coma, Mum.

311
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,568
I want to go home.

312
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:58,654
That I promise you.

313
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:02,241
We want to celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

314
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:02,700
We want to celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

315
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:06,662
Alex, that's complete madness.
- We don't leave her alone, we promised her.

316
00:32:06,704 --> 00:32:10,666
Mum is fatally ill.
It's better for her here. They've got the equipment.

317
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:15,170
Just this once, be realistic.
- No, you be realistic.

318
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:19,341
What happens when she doesn't have a single room anymore?
Or when someone lets the cat out of the bag?

319
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:23,637
She'll hear what is happening outside in here.
She won't take it.

320
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:29,184
Alright, all of this rubbish has to come out.

321
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:34,940
Are mum's curtains still in the basement
- You can't be serious.

322
00:32:34,981 --> 00:32:37,859
They're rawlplugged.

323
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:41,363
Oh great!
- Guess it'll have to be re-plastered.

324
00:32:41,363 --> 00:32:42,823
Oh great!
- Guess it'll have to be re-plastered.

325
00:32:42,823 --> 00:32:46,159
Can you please tell me what he's doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

326
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,996
What should I think? - What should he think?
- That you have to make way.

327
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:53,375
Or should we put Mum in the basement?
- Excuse me, I've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months!

328
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,167
Or should we put Mum in the basement?
- Excuse me, I've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months!

329
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:58,171
Generous of you, Rainer! - For the whole apartment!
47,80 German Mark! In the West

330
00:32:58,213 --> 00:33:02,175
And in the East you have to wait 10 years to get a telephone connection!
- Can't you just...?

331
00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:06,179
Mum has to find the room
in the same condition she left it in. The doctor said

332
00:33:06,221 --> 00:33:10,183
she has to stay in bad okay?
So it's only about this one room.

333
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:14,854
And when she's better, we'll see what we'll do.
- You didn't get what the doctor said. Mum will probably...

334
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:18,900
That's what you said 3 months ago,
when you wanted to switch off the machines.

335
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:23,529
That was a different situation, you can't compare this!
- What do you want to tell her then, Ariane?

336
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:28,576
That you've given up your studies,
because you're selling Hamburgers now?

337
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:34,582
"Enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing Burger King."

338
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:48,095
8th floor?.
- Yeah.

339
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,973
Elevator, hm?
- Broken. - Shit.

340
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:53,392
You can say that again.

341
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:27,676
My life changed drastically.

342
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:30,345
My life changed drastically.

343
00:34:30,345 --> 00:34:34,182
And the day we wanted to take mum home
was ever drawing nearer,

344
00:34:34,182 --> 00:34:37,519
relentlessly like a big Russian tank.

345
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,437
What're you doing sniffling in my cupboard?
- Not in your cupboard. That's from the old clothes collection.

346
00:34:39,437 --> 00:34:41,815
What're you doing sniffling in my cupboard?
- Not in your cupboard. That's from the old clothes collection.

347
00:34:41,856 --> 00:34:46,987
And how do you look?
It would be nice if you would think a little for a change.

348
00:34:47,028 --> 00:34:50,323
Look at this. This garbage is what we used to wear.

349
00:34:54,202 --> 00:34:56,788
Sign here.

350
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,792
The physiotherapist is coming
3 times a week. Have you got any more questions?

351
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:05,797
Your mother is going at her own responsibility.
You know how I think about this.

352
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:08,800
Where is the previous Doctor, by the way?

353
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:12,845
Doctor Wagner, he went to Düsseldorf.
- I understand. And you?

354
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,683
When do you run away?
And you want to lecture me about responsibility.

355
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:25,358
Please lie down a second.

356
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:29,820
Why?
- Please. Just lie down.

357
00:35:36,994 --> 00:35:42,666
If there's another cardiac arrest:
short, strong thumps on the chest.

358
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,172
Careful! She mustn't wake up.
- Alright, boss!

359
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:52,551
Ariane and I'll set up a schedule.
And there's the physiotherapest.

360
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:55,638
There's always someone with her. It'll work.

361
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,142
Most GDR citizens already exchanged
their savings cashlessly.

362
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:04,188
There are only 2 weeks left.
You should hurry. Because as Gorbatschow once said:

363
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:07,149
He who is late...
- Excuse me?.

364
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:10,152
will be punished all his life. - I can't hear it anymore.
- Excuse me!

365
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:14,156
Could you tune down the radio please?
My mother needs rest.

366
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:16,783
Alright, boss.

367
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:26,084
Don't you want to introduce us?
- Oh yes, of course. This is Lara.

368
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:28,128
Hello, Lara.

369
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:44,102
Could you let me past, please?

370
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,525
Hello, Christiane!

371
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,237
Alex! What is it?

372
00:36:54,696 --> 00:36:56,698
Hello? Alex!

373
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:11,003
Nothing's changed in here.

374
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:15,174
What should have changed?

375
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:19,178
Oh, if you're bored,
you can listen to cassettes.

376
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,181
I'm afraid the radio receiver is broken.

377
00:37:22,348 --> 00:37:25,351
But I'll repair that.
- Alex?

378
00:37:30,272 --> 00:37:34,276
It's good to know
you're not alone.

379
00:37:36,612 --> 00:37:39,490
When your father...

380
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:45,621
When he was suddenly gone...

381
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:50,751
I didn't think I'd make it.

382
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:58,258
I never told you that...

383
00:38:02,262 --> 00:38:06,141
I thought about laying hands upon myself.

384
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:14,191
But you visited every day.

385
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:18,487
And you talked about school and Sigmund Jähn.

386
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:21,490
You heard that?

387
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,914
I'm sorry to cause you so much work.

388
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,792
I can't even use the toilet by myself.
- Mum.

389
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:36,087
That doesn't matter.

390
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:40,216
The important thing is for you to get well.

391
00:38:40,592 --> 00:38:43,219
I'll try hard.

392
00:38:43,678 --> 00:38:46,556
You have to rest now.

393
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:52,687
I'll just go to the shop,
but Ariane is still there.

394
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:56,316
Oh, Alex...?

395
00:38:56,357 --> 00:39:00,737
I'm craving for Spreewood gherkins.
Can you fetch me some?

396
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:03,197
No problem, Mum.

397
00:39:04,365 --> 00:39:07,243
That's what I thought.

398
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:14,959
At the end of June 1990 the shops of
our socialist Fatherland were emptied.

399
00:39:15,668 --> 00:39:19,672
Real money was coming in from the country
behind the Wall.

400
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:27,179
While most citizens queued in long lines in front of the
Republic banks with their usual patience...

401
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:29,932
we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook.

402
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:33,227
we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook.

403
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:48,575
Yearned for by everyone, the German Mark flooded
our little community.

404
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:51,954
Halleluja, Halleluja...

405
00:39:51,995 --> 00:39:54,998
Halleluja, German Mark!

406
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:59,628
(Song) Such a day, so wonderful...

407
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,298
And the money was exchanged 2 to 1.
Germany won 1:0!

408
00:40:04,216 --> 00:40:08,679
Unstoppable shot!
Germany is one-nil up by Lothar Matthäus!

409
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:26,488
Mocca Fix? - Haven't got that anymore.
Filinchen Crispbread? - Not for sale anymore.

410
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:30,575
Spreewood gherkins?
- Goodness, where do you live, boy?

411
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:34,954
We've got the German Mark now. And there you come
asking for Mocca Fix and Filinchen?

412
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:40,168
Over night, our grey store was transformed
into a colourful product paradise.

413
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:40,668
Over night, our store was transformed
into a colourful product paradise.

414
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:44,172
And I became the king as a customer.

415
00:40:44,214 --> 00:40:46,841
They're from the Netherlands.

416
00:40:51,304 --> 00:40:53,890
Good afternoon, Mr. Ganske.

417
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:06,819
That's how far they've driven us already...
that we have to go fishing in the garbage.

418
00:41:07,695 --> 00:41:11,157
Mister Ganske,
have you still got Spreewood gherkins?

419
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:14,076
What?
- Spreewood gherkins!

420
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:18,372
I'm sorry, young man.
I'm unemployed myself.

421
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:23,002
An empty glass would do, too.

422
00:41:47,192 --> 00:41:50,571
I wanted to introduce Rainer to Mum today.

423
00:41:50,612 --> 00:41:54,491
Later.
We don't want to demand to much of her.

424
00:41:59,204 --> 00:42:02,082
Perhaps you're right.

425
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,751
Yes.

426
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:10,006
I'm afraid there was a supply shortage
for Spreewood gherkins.

427
00:42:10,215 --> 00:42:13,176
It's alright. These are fine too.

428
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:21,309
Listen, you really don't have to take
care of me all the time.

429
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:24,229
It's awkward for me.
- Mum.

430
00:42:24,354 --> 00:42:27,232
No, really. Maybe...

431
00:42:27,691 --> 00:42:32,570
... you could put the TV next to the bed.
Then I'll manage by my own.

432
00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:36,658
Watching TV still is too tiring for you.
- But why? Why shouldn't I...

433
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:42,372
be able to watch TV?
- We'll ask the Doctor.

434
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:47,585
Mum, we have to talk to you about something.

435
00:42:47,669 --> 00:42:50,546
It's like this...

436
00:42:50,672 --> 00:42:53,633
We wanted to ask you if...

437
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:58,262
We need your authorization to access your bank account.
- What is it?

438
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,558
Do you need money?
- No. No.

439
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:08,147
It's just that you can't go walk
the bank by yourself anymore.

440
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:11,192
And it would simply be better if...

441
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:14,653
you sign this.

442
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:17,281
Yes, and...

443
00:43:17,323 --> 00:43:20,201
maybe now would be best.

444
00:43:24,914 --> 00:43:27,791
But there's no hurry is there?

445
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:36,050
You're keeping something from me?
Has something happened? Are you in debt?

446
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:39,094
Please trust us, it's important!

447
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:45,309
Before I let you have all my money,
I have got a right to know what it's for don't I?

448
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,144
All right.

449
00:43:47,352 --> 00:43:51,356
It was supposed to be
a surprise but...

450
00:43:51,815 --> 00:43:55,402
We received a notification.

451
00:43:55,694 --> 00:43:58,363
From Zwickau.
We can fetch our "Trabant" (GDR car).

452
00:43:58,363 --> 00:43:59,990
From Zwickau.
We can fetch our "Trabant" (GDR car).

453
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,409
After only 3 years?

454
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:06,246
And for that we need the money
that you've saved.

455
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:13,837
You don't think...
I got my money at the bank?

456
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,467
I've hidden it.

457
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:23,054
And where?
- Where?

458
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:32,438
I forgot.

459
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:38,611
I've totally forgotten, it's all gone.
- Mum, just think.

460
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:52,333
Father is coming home late today,
don't you think?

461
00:45:16,315 --> 00:45:18,108
Mum...

462
00:45:19,693 --> 00:45:24,281
That's alright.
Soon you'll be better again.

463
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,454
We'll celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

464
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:36,418
With the house community.
We have always celebrated it.

465
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:45,177
This is the First German Television
with the news.

466
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,098
Comrade Ganske watches West-TV?

467
00:45:55,354 --> 00:45:59,232
Comrade Ganske fell in love.
During a vacation in Hungary.

468
00:45:59,274 --> 00:46:02,277
With a pensioner from... Munich.

469
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:06,198
Since then his love for the party has suffered.

470
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:08,158
Oh.
- Well...

471
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:12,412
Are you finished?

472
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:20,628
I'm sorry I'm late again.
- There it is. Even with a balcony.

473
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,756
Since some citizens didn't even return from their
vacation in Hungary,

474
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:24,466
Since some citizens didn't even return from their
vacation in Hungary,

475
00:46:24,466 --> 00:46:28,803
the apartment market in the Capital eased considerably.

476
00:46:28,803 --> 00:46:32,640
There were deserted apartments everywhere,
which we only had to enter.

477
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,559
The guy moved to the West last year.
A colleague gave me the hint.

478
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,644
The guy moved to the West last year.
A colleague gave me the hint.

479
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:35,118
Get a load of that! - Get a load of that
- It's working! - Tempo-beans!

480
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:40,791
Globus green peas!
That can't be true.

481
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:45,128
Mocca Fix Gold!
I've been looking for that all the time!

482
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:56,223
Can I have that?

483
00:48:28,379 --> 00:48:31,007
I have to go.

484
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,345
Sleep on...

485
00:48:59,952 --> 00:49:02,246
Morning, Mum.

486
00:49:02,288 --> 00:49:04,874
Morning, Alex.

487
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:09,170
Are you in a hurry?
- I have to go to work.

488
00:49:09,295 --> 00:49:12,131
Alex, please remember the TV.
- Let's talk about that later.

489
00:49:12,131 --> 00:49:13,424
Alex, please remember the TV.
- Let's talk about that later.

490
00:49:13,424 --> 00:49:19,179
Oh and about my birthday.
Invite Klapprath and perhaps a few pupils.

491
00:49:19,179 --> 00:49:23,058
As if the fucking gherkins weren't enough trouble already.
Now she wants to watch TV.

492
00:49:23,183 --> 00:49:27,146
What should I do?
- Yeah, Houston. We got a problem.

493
00:49:29,189 --> 00:49:33,193
Yeah, and now? - I thought you might have an idea.
No, I meant the picture.

494
00:49:33,986 --> 00:49:35,779
Oh.

495
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,619
Now?
- Nope.

496
00:49:42,661 --> 00:49:47,624
It didn't work very long.
- Semi-finale! I'll just go over to the Pollnicks.

497
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:50,252
Then go already.

498
00:49:51,419 --> 00:49:55,131
Excuse me.
Are those gherkins from the Spreewood?

499
00:49:55,215 --> 00:49:57,634
Nope, from the Netherlands.

500
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:03,348
Just show her something old.
- What do you mean?

501
00:50:04,182 --> 00:50:07,143
Old East-TV stuff on video tape.

502
00:50:07,185 --> 00:50:10,647
News from last year? She'll notice for sure.

503
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:15,151
Ah, I don't think so. It was always the same rubbish.
- Where should I get the videos from?

504
00:50:15,193 --> 00:50:18,613
I haven't even got a recorder.
- Bad enough.

505
00:50:18,696 --> 00:50:20,323
What's the score?

506
00:50:20,323 --> 00:50:20,782
What's the score?

507
00:50:20,823 --> 00:50:25,453
Beckenbauer, Rudi Völler...
You don't want to see it...

508
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:30,416
Germany made it into the finale!

509
00:50:33,294 --> 00:50:37,256
While the world time clock at the Alexander Square
rushed towards mother's birthday,

510
00:50:37,256 --> 00:50:41,219
a tiny round ball united the social development...

511
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:45,222
of the split nation and let things, that belonged
together, grow together.

512
00:50:45,264 --> 00:50:49,518
I slaved away like a Hero of Labour to resurrect
the GDR in every detail

513
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,564
in mother's room until this day.

514
00:50:53,606 --> 00:50:57,610
Have the cross-word puzzles already been solved?
- Untouched like a virgin.

515
00:50:57,651 --> 00:51:00,529
Great. I'll take them all.

516
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,408
Oh and these ones too.

517
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:11,040
They laid my daughter off too.
All of a sudden it was: "Thank you, and goodbye."

518
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,377
And for that we worked for 40 years, oh leave me alone......
They'll even drop the TV ballet.

519
00:51:15,377 --> 00:51:17,296
Don't you do anything apart from watching TV?

520
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:18,172
Don't you do anything apart from watching TV?

521
00:51:18,213 --> 00:51:22,176
To get back to my mother. The problem is that

522
00:51:22,176 --> 00:51:26,180
she doesn't know about the Fall of the Wall
- Enviable.

523
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:32,936
And it's her birthday next week.
She would really be happy about a visit.

524
00:51:34,187 --> 00:51:38,650
Have you really got it now?
I don't want to hear one false word.

525
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:41,653
And our 20 Marks?
- The work comes first.

526
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:46,158
The first guests were invited.
Others still had to be persuaded.

527
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:50,161
A lot of people of the Polytechnical Secondary School
"Werner Seelenbinder"...

528
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:54,165
had withdrawn to their private lives.
Including Doctor Klapprath.

529
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:55,417
Once headmaster and outstanding
teacher of the People.

530
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:57,585
Once headmaster and outstanding
teacher of the People.

531
00:51:57,585 --> 00:52:00,964
We were all valuable people.

532
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:03,341
Isn't that right, Alex?

533
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:07,178
I admired your mother.
She was an outstanding educator.

534
00:52:07,178 --> 00:52:09,681
I admired your mother.
She was an outstanding educator.

535
00:52:09,722 --> 00:52:12,600
And an excellent human being.

536
00:52:12,851 --> 00:52:15,812
That's why she was neutralized.

537
00:52:18,022 --> 00:52:21,651
Some comrades in the collective
thought her to be too...

538
00:52:22,694 --> 00:52:25,279
idealistic.

539
00:52:25,488 --> 00:52:28,074
Ever since your father...

540
00:52:30,326 --> 00:52:33,287
Her idealism was well-respected, but...

541
00:52:35,206 --> 00:52:39,168
in the daily school routine, it...
can become problematic sometimes.

542
00:52:40,002 --> 00:52:43,005
And then you simply gave her the boot.

543
00:52:48,177 --> 00:52:51,806
You still owe her something.
- Yes.

544
00:52:57,603 --> 00:53:01,440
You're a Dispatcher. Can you remember that?
- Dispatcher? In the East?

545
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,736
Yes, of course in the East. You organize the
purchasing of a Mitropa-Restaurant.

546
00:53:05,736 --> 00:53:09,615
Write this down:
School Education EOS Juri Gagarin.

547
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:09,990
Write this down:
School Education EOS Juri Gagarin.

548
00:53:10,199 --> 00:53:14,161
And you were Group Council Chairman with
the Pioneers. - Group Council... what?

549
00:53:14,203 --> 00:53:17,164
Group Council Chairman.
- That's enough.

550
00:53:17,206 --> 00:53:23,128
I won't use those plastic diapers anymore.
That's going too far.

551
00:53:23,921 --> 00:53:26,924
Got it?
Yes, Group Council Chairman.

552
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:31,136
Here you are, 30 broadcasts of "Current Camera",
10 broadcasts of "Black Channel"...

553
00:53:31,178 --> 00:53:35,140
6 broadcasts "Colourful Boiler" and 4 broadcasts of
"A Day in the West". It's all copied.

554
00:53:35,182 --> 00:53:39,144
Sponsored by the country's picture library
and a very charming Denis.

555
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:40,770
I hope that'll work.

556
00:53:44,524 --> 00:53:50,196
What are you doing crawling on the ground?
- That's the cable for the antenna so you can watch TV?

557
00:53:59,664 --> 00:54:04,127
We've got the World Cup. Truly a gift.
There is no better time to

558
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,171
supply satellite dishes to the East.

559
00:54:08,006 --> 00:54:10,967
Okay? Got it? We come to phase 3...

560
00:54:17,015 --> 00:54:20,977
What was that?
- No idea. Interferences, happens from time to time.

561
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:25,148
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome
to the "Current Camera".

562
00:54:25,189 --> 00:54:30,611
Hard provocation against the border.
Protests in the Chancellor's office in the FRG (West Germany).

563
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:34,615
Chip-Power GDR.
The foreign press acknowledges achievements...

564
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:38,619
Things are running outside
and I feel so useless in here.

565
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:42,623
Can't you put a note on the house community's
pin board?

566
00:54:42,665 --> 00:54:47,545
Whoever's got any problems can come to me.
I can write inputs from bed.

567
00:54:47,586 --> 00:54:51,590
I don't know.
You shouldn't exert yourself.

568
00:54:54,009 --> 00:54:57,596
Morning, Alex. Is it time already?

569
00:55:06,355 --> 00:55:09,358
You want a swig? You want a swig?
- Oh holy shit!

570
00:55:12,194 --> 00:55:15,072
Shit. Shit, yes? Shit!

571
00:55:15,447 --> 00:55:18,408
Goodness, goddamn shit!

572
00:55:32,923 --> 00:55:35,509
I feel sick.

573
00:55:40,597 --> 00:55:42,307
While many loudly thought of themself
being the World Cup holders of tomorrow,

574
00:55:42,307 --> 00:55:44,643
While many loudly thought of themself
being the World Cup holders of tomorrow,

575
00:55:44,643 --> 00:55:47,979
sounds from the past
came out of mother's bedroom.

576
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:52,776
Our home
is not only the towns...

577
00:55:52,776 --> 00:55:54,235
and villages...

578
00:55:55,195 --> 00:56:00,158
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

579
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,827
Our home...

580
00:56:03,203 --> 00:56:07,957
is the grass on the sward,
the corn on the field...

581
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,669
and the birds...

582
00:56:11,919 --> 00:56:16,966
in the air and the animals on the ground...

583
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:22,972
and the fishes in the river are the home...

584
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:25,808
And we love the...

585
00:56:32,732 --> 00:56:36,360
That was wonderful. Thank you. Thank you, children.

586
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:40,197
You learned that from me, didn't you?

587
00:56:42,408 --> 00:56:43,993
Yes.

588
00:56:47,913 --> 00:56:50,207
Dear Christiane!

589
00:56:50,249 --> 00:56:53,210
We are here... today... here,

590
00:56:53,335 --> 00:56:57,214
because it's your birthday.
And... I would like to wish...

591
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:02,469
you all the best
in the name of the party direction.

592
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:05,973
And...

593
00:57:07,307 --> 00:57:09,101
the basket.

594
00:57:11,353 --> 00:57:13,146
For you.

595
00:57:14,022 --> 00:57:17,025
That's kind of you. Thank you.

596
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:20,737
Klapprath.

597
00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:24,366
Rosenthaler Kadarka... Mocca Fix Gold...

598
00:57:25,992 --> 00:57:28,578
Globus green peas.

599
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:32,666
The colleagues and... the comrades...

600
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:38,004
of the POS "Werner Seelenbinder"... they...

601
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:43,176
would like to thank you in particular
for all the years,

602
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,971
Christiane, that you... were...

603
00:57:49,015 --> 00:57:51,893
a... good colleague...

604
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:55,480
and... a dear comrade...

605
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,776
uhm...

606
00:58:01,194 --> 00:58:05,448
And anyway, I wish you all the best
for your birthday and remain the same person you are...

607
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,492
Christiane.

608
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,336
Dear comrade Kerner...

609
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,298
All the best...

610
00:58:22,757 --> 00:58:25,343
and... good health...

611
00:58:25,926 --> 00:58:29,513
and that everything will be
as it used to be again.

612
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:35,644
Lara, come here.

613
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:42,568
This is Lara.

614
00:58:42,735 --> 00:58:45,738
An exchange student from the Soviet Union.

615
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,658
Her dad is a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

616
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:54,580
Don't marry him too early.
- Mum.

617
00:58:54,997 --> 00:58:58,876
Even though the thing with the flat
will work out earlier then.

618
00:59:00,252 --> 00:59:04,131
My Alex can be
a real block-head sometimes.

619
00:59:06,258 --> 00:59:08,844
And Rainer...

620
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:12,639
that's my Ariane's new boyfriend.

621
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:16,059
He... he is a...

622
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:20,272
Dispatcher.
- Right, I'm a Dispatcher.

623
00:59:21,314 --> 00:59:25,861
I used to be with them myself...
All the best from the heart... Pioneers!

624
00:59:25,902 --> 00:59:29,864
I used to be with the
Free German Pioneers...

625
00:59:29,906 --> 00:59:32,158
Thank you, Rainer.

626
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,786
As a Group... um...

627
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:36,997
Cha...

628
00:59:37,205 --> 00:59:40,166
Group Chairman... back then...
- Thank you!

629
00:59:41,876 --> 00:59:45,463
Be ready, be ready!
- Thank you, Rainer!

630
00:59:49,175 --> 00:59:53,179
Yes, Mum. Another year is over.
What's changed?

631
00:59:54,264 --> 00:59:58,851
Not much really.
Paula got her teeth and a new dad.

632
00:59:59,977 --> 01:00:01,938
And me... yes.

633
01:00:01,979 --> 01:00:06,234
Unfortunately, we cannot go over to
the Café Moskow to drink to your health,

634
01:00:06,234 --> 01:00:10,071
but we're all together.
And that's the most important thing.

635
01:00:10,071 --> 01:00:13,908
We didn't always make it easy for you,
but you were always there for us.

636
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,162
And, by any rate, I can't think of
a better family than ours.

637
01:00:18,204 --> 01:00:22,625
And that's what I wanted to thank you for.
Mum, you're the best mother in the world.

638
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:25,628
Alex?
- And we all love you.

639
01:00:25,669 --> 01:00:28,255
Alex?.
- What's the matter?

640
01:00:28,672 --> 01:00:31,258
What's that?

641
01:00:33,677 --> 01:00:36,639
That's...
- Yes, what's the meaning of that?

642
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,643
I don't know what the comrades are doing there again...
A fata morgana.

643
01:00:40,684 --> 01:00:45,856
That's from the West.
- It's a mirage.

644
01:00:48,984 --> 01:00:54,281
It will have been approved somehow.
- Please calm down, Mum!

645
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:57,326
There's an explanation for everything. Right...

646
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:01,997
Boys, please sing something, will you?

647
01:01:02,289 --> 01:01:05,292
Lara! Wait a moment, I... Lara?.

648
01:01:07,044 --> 01:01:10,630
"Build up, build up".

649
01:01:12,924 --> 01:01:14,593
What's the matter all of a sudden?

650
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:19,556
Build up.
For a better future...

651
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:22,517
we build up our home...

652
01:01:22,642 --> 01:01:27,814
I'm sorry for your mother.
What you're doing is too scary for me.

653
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:34,154
And what is this nonsense
about my father being a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

654
01:01:34,195 --> 01:01:38,241
He was a simple cook, you know that.
- But she rejoiced in that.

655
01:01:38,283 --> 01:01:43,454
What should I've told her?
That he's dead? In her state?

656
01:01:46,499 --> 01:01:50,461
You mean to say, when you're lying already,
it doesn't make any difference anyway.

657
01:01:50,503 --> 01:01:54,132
Cheers for her,
cheers for her...

658
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:55,967
Lara!

659
01:01:56,676 --> 01:02:00,263
Cheers for her,
cheers for her...

660
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:03,182
three cheers for her!

661
01:02:03,975 --> 01:02:06,561
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

662
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:18,864
Just a little further away.

663
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:19,865
Just a little further away.

664
01:02:20,366 --> 01:02:22,535
Just a little more..

665
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:26,539
Watch out, will you? We're filming here!
- Can I see your authorization?

666
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:30,167
Didn't he inform you?
- Me? Who?

667
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:34,129
Oh, what was his name?
- Something with "M".

668
01:02:34,171 --> 01:02:38,175
I'll just go and ask around.
Until then, you don't film anything!

669
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,347
Got the logo? - Yes.
Sharpness on me?- Yes.

670
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:50,729
We're waiting for the evening sun.
- Don't overdo it, the guy will be back soon.

671
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:54,691
Just you wait.
With the evening sun it'll look brill.

672
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:59,154
When I stared at the clouds on that day,
I realized that the truth

673
01:02:59,196 --> 01:03:03,158
was just a doubtful matter,
that I could adapt to mother's

674
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,117
familiar surroundings.

675
01:03:04,117 --> 01:03:05,911
familiar surroundings.

676
01:03:07,329 --> 01:03:11,166
I only had to study the language
of "Current Camera"...

677
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:15,045
and spur on Denis' ambition
as a film director.

678
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:21,551
Today Günther Mittag, secretary for Economy
in the CC of the SUD,

679
01:03:21,593 --> 01:03:25,930
visited the Coca Cola group in West Berlin.
The reason for the comrade's visit are...

680
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:30,602
details of the completed
trade agreement between Coca Cola...

681
01:03:30,685 --> 01:03:33,646
and the VEB Drink Collective Combine Leipzig.

682
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:38,693
Security officers of West Berlin hinder
the work of the GDR television.

683
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:42,697
Surely, the capitalistic press
censors find the loss the mighty

684
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:46,117
Coca Cola group has suffered against the
VEB Drink Collective Combine Leipzig...

685
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,163
in the patent procedure too embarrassing...
Please let the GDR television

686
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:54,125
work undisturbed!
- That's it, I'm calling the police!

687
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:58,129
A testimonial of international
scientists now finally confirmed

688
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:02,133
to the Collective Combine,
that the original Coca Cola flavour

689
01:04:02,174 --> 01:04:07,221
was developed in the 50s
in laboratories of the GDR. Back to the studio.

690
01:04:07,263 --> 01:04:10,850
Coca Cola is a socialist drink?

691
01:04:11,183 --> 01:04:14,603
I thought, Cola existed before the war.

692
01:04:14,645 --> 01:04:18,607
Don't you understand, Mum?
The West ripped us off all these years!

693
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:22,611
Until the end of August
593 deaths by drugs were registered.

694
01:04:22,653 --> 01:04:26,657
60% more than in the year before.
- Now I remember!

695
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:31,745
What?
- Where I hid the money.

696
01:04:33,205 --> 01:04:36,125
In the living room. In the small chest of drawers.

697
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:39,628
In the left drawer
under the wax paper.

698
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:43,132
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste.

699
01:04:43,173 --> 01:04:46,176
How could I forget?

700
01:04:51,682 --> 01:04:54,643
Hey, here I am!
- Oh, hello!

701
01:04:58,021 --> 01:04:59,606
And?

702
01:05:01,525 --> 01:05:04,945
Has she swallowed it?
- Yes, of course. - Really?

703
01:05:04,986 --> 01:05:08,990
Has she really swallowed it?
- I'm telling you.

704
01:05:12,202 --> 01:05:16,164
They've driven us this far!
- Good evening, Mister Ganske.

705
01:05:17,165 --> 01:05:20,126
They betrayed us and sold us out!

706
01:05:20,168 --> 01:05:23,630
The lack of sharpness didn't irritate her?
- No.

707
01:05:23,671 --> 01:05:27,634
And for that we worked 40 years...
- We could rebuild a studio.

708
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:31,638
We would have different possibilites
with a blue box.

709
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,390
What... what are you doing there?

710
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:53,910
And? What should we do with it?
- Exchange it, of course.

711
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:57,747
I'm sorry, but the deadline expired
2 days ago.

712
01:05:57,747 --> 01:05:59,498
I'm sorry, but the deadline expired
2 days ago.

713
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:04,128
But it's a special case.
- We've only just found it today.

714
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:08,132
It's even okay for us,
if you exchange 1 to 4 or 1 to 5...

715
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:12,636
I'm afraid there is no prolongation.
And we wouldn't have exchanged cash anyway.

716
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:15,639
That can't be!
- It has to be possible!

717
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:19,602
I'm sure you heard me. Time's up!
- Your time is up soon, you bastard!

718
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:23,606
These are 30,000 East Marks! That was our money,
for 40 damned years!

719
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:27,609
Now you Western fuck want to tell me,
this isn't worth anything?

720
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:31,238
Please leave our premises now.

721
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,658
Keep your hands off! And what are you all gawking at?

722
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,078
It used to be your money, too!

723
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:43,458
Keep your hands off! You assholes!

724
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:52,592
Are you going mad or what?

725
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:57,139
I felt like a Commander
of a submarine in the Northsea-Fleet,

726
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:01,143
whose battle-hardened steel skin
had sprung a leak.

727
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:05,146
Everytime I closed a leak,
another one opened.

728
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:09,150
Ariane denied being my brother in arms,
the class enemy raised his Cola-flag

729
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:14,364
and a fresh wind from the West
blew mother's East money around my ears.

730
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,786
What're you laughing about?
- Yell.

731
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,872
Why?
- You have to vent some air.

732
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:26,167
Open up your valves. Just yell!

733
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:57,615
In Summer 1990, the German
national team exceeded the plan...

734
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:01,494
and became World Cup holder.

735
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,622
And mother kept on getting better.

736
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:05,039
The pullover marked "Size 48" has the
width of a "Size 54"

737
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,793
The pullover marked "Size 48" has the
width of a "Size 54"

738
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:12,129
and the length of a "Size 38". Full-stop.

739
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:16,926
I don't know how the employees
of Milena come to these measurements.

740
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:22,848
In the Capital there are no people who
are so small and square. Full-stop.

741
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,644
Christiane, that's good.

742
01:08:28,645 --> 01:08:33,275
If it's our fault...
If it's... our fault...

743
01:08:34,776 --> 01:08:40,741
that we cannot accommodate the Central Plan
with our sizes, comma...

744
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:44,995
we would like to apologize for that. Full stop.

745
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:49,124
In this case...
we shall endeavour to become, comma...

746
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:53,170
in the future, smaller and
squarer. Full stop.

747
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:58,049
With socialist salutations.

748
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,552
Hanna Schäfer.

749
01:09:05,181 --> 01:09:07,309
Hello, Mrs. Schäfer.

750
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:12,772
Oh Alex. It's so nice to talk to your mother.
It feels just like living in the past.

751
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:16,776
A little changes here and there
and I'll send it to the OTTO mail-order company.

752
01:09:19,654 --> 01:09:21,781
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

753
01:09:21,781 --> 01:09:23,658
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

754
01:09:23,658 --> 01:09:26,077
Our home...

755
01:09:30,373 --> 01:09:33,751
I've got some nice visitors.
That's Frank and Christian...

756
01:09:33,751 --> 01:09:36,629
of my former class.
- Hello.

757
01:09:36,671 --> 01:09:40,550
Hello.
Mrs. Kerner has to rest now, alright?

758
01:09:41,467 --> 01:09:44,345
Bye.
- Alex, why?

759
01:09:46,472 --> 01:09:50,434
Now scram!
- And the 20 Marks? - What 20 Marks?

760
01:09:50,476 --> 01:09:54,438
Sascha said,
we'd get 20 Marks for that!

761
01:09:54,647 --> 01:09:58,609
Hello, Mr. Mehlert. - Hello, Alex.
Problems with the toaster?

762
01:09:58,651 --> 01:10:02,947
My mother will be happy,
just go ahead. And you get out of here!

763
01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:08,160
And tell your mates, I don't want to see a Pioneer here ever again. - Alright, boss.

764
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:16,627
Have you gone nuts?

765
01:10:16,669 --> 01:10:20,631
You can't just let the
boys in here!

766
01:10:20,672 --> 01:10:23,634
But why? She was pleased, wasn't she?

767
01:10:23,675 --> 01:10:29,598
You can't do anything right with you Easties!
Having something to complain about is what matters to you most!

768
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,602
You're just like your mother
and her stupid GDR-inputs.

769
01:10:33,644 --> 01:10:35,604
My mother doesn't grumble!
She's trying to change

770
01:10:35,646 --> 01:10:39,608
the conditions of the society step by
step through constructive criticism. - Sure.

771
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,611
And you were never interested in that!
- Nope.

772
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:47,115
Haven't you noticed?
We're in the socialist veteran's club.

773
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:50,660
Good evening.
Why don't you take admission fees?

774
01:10:50,702 --> 01:10:52,704
Yeah, let's charge admission fees!

775
01:10:52,746 --> 01:10:57,125
You be quiet.
He's bought a Trabbi (GDR car). - Really?

776
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:58,960
An estate car.

777
01:10:59,169 --> 01:11:03,131
That can't be happening. Paula will get a defect,
if this goes on much longer. - Oh come on!

778
01:11:03,173 --> 01:11:06,634
20 years in the GDR didn't harm
our health, did they?

779
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:09,637
I've really got my doubts about you.

780
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,765
Shit. Shit!

781
01:11:17,729 --> 01:11:20,315
Well done. Get a cloth.

782
01:11:35,163 --> 01:11:38,166
What is it? Nosebleeds again.

783
01:11:44,171 --> 01:11:48,134
I know it's a little stressful at the moment
I'd also prefer,

784
01:11:48,175 --> 01:11:53,389
if we didn't have to...
- I saw dad... earlier.

785
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:57,184
Where?.
- At work.

786
01:11:58,686 --> 01:12:01,689
I recognized his voice immediately.

787
01:12:01,814 --> 01:12:04,316
What did he say?

788
01:12:04,483 --> 01:12:06,527
3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise, please.

789
01:12:06,527 --> 01:12:08,279
3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise, please.

790
01:12:12,616 --> 01:12:15,994
Um, 3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise!

791
01:12:30,509 --> 01:12:33,387
And... what does he look like?

792
01:12:35,764 --> 01:12:40,393
He drives a Volvo estate car and
got glasses with a golden rim.

793
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:45,065
What did you tell him?

794
01:12:45,982 --> 01:12:50,195
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

795
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:57,285
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

796
01:13:21,559 --> 01:13:25,938
My father lived somewhere in this City.
I saw his image in my mind.

797
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:31,944
A fat guy who stuffed himself with cheeseburgers
and chips all day.

798
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:42,788
He lived in his world and I lived in mine.

799
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:46,792
He didn't have anything to do with me
and I didn't have anything to do with him.

800
01:13:55,176 --> 01:13:58,512
Hold still or it won't work.

801
01:13:58,596 --> 01:14:01,557
Will it take much longer?

802
01:14:04,643 --> 01:14:08,647
'cause I have to be home
in 2 hours at the latest.

803
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:14,361
You always have to be somewhere in 2 hours.
It's getting boring.

804
01:14:15,195 --> 01:14:19,116
Oh great. I got a sick mother,
a demanding job...

805
01:14:19,157 --> 01:14:23,120
and a miffed girlfriend.
- I've got my exams in 2 days.

806
01:14:23,161 --> 01:14:27,165
It's second nature to you.
This little bit of putting a plaster on.

807
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:30,335
Then I can stop learning, can't I?

808
01:14:31,878 --> 01:14:35,882
I was well-meant.
I believe in you.

809
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:39,511
Lara, stop this shit, please!

810
01:14:39,594 --> 01:14:42,556
You have to tell your mother!
- What?

811
01:14:42,597 --> 01:14:47,602
You have to tell your mother!
- Not because of me, but because of her!

812
01:14:51,398 --> 01:14:54,025
Lara!
- What?

813
01:14:54,651 --> 01:14:57,237
Shit! Lara!

814
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:15,004
The life in our little country
became ever faster.

815
01:15:15,004 --> 01:15:20,301
Somehow we were all just like atoms
in a big particle accelerator.

816
01:15:20,301 --> 01:15:22,678
But away from all the frantic pace of the new time
there was a place of quiet,

817
01:15:22,678 --> 01:15:24,138
But away from all the frantic pace of the new time
there was a place of quiet,

818
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:30,144
silence and leisureliness,
where I could finally have a lie-in.

819
01:15:31,687 --> 01:15:37,652
Well, Paula. Alex didn't use to be
so tired when he came home from work.

820
01:15:45,034 --> 01:15:47,995
Our Paula's learning to walk, Alex!

821
01:15:53,459 --> 01:15:55,252
There! There!

822
01:16:14,438 --> 01:16:16,064
There!

823
01:16:20,694 --> 01:16:23,697
See? I can do it, too.

824
01:16:33,248 --> 01:16:35,834
Paula! See?

825
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:43,258
My little Paula. Come to your Granny.
Come, come.

826
01:16:47,554 --> 01:16:51,558
Now we'll show Alex,
what we can do, okay?

827
01:16:52,183 --> 01:16:53,977
Right...

828
01:17:00,275 --> 01:17:04,237
Now let's see just how far
your Granny can walk.

829
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:58,082
Hi! - Hi!
- Good afternoon.

830
01:18:10,636 --> 01:18:14,139
Young man,
can I just sit down for a moment here please?

831
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:16,767
Of course.

832
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:28,487
You're not from here, are you?
- Nope, from Wuppertal.

833
01:18:28,528 --> 01:18:30,530
From the West?

834
01:19:36,762 --> 01:19:38,681
Mum?

835
01:20:37,155 --> 01:20:40,158
Mum, what are you doing? Come on.
- Mum!

836
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:46,831
What is it with you?
You can't just get up! Shit.

837
01:20:50,668 --> 01:20:53,546
What's actually happening here?

838
01:20:57,175 --> 01:21:01,179
Central Committee of the Socialist...
Unity Party of...

839
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:05,016
Germany.

840
01:21:05,975 --> 01:21:08,853
Sound is in order.
- Right.

841
01:21:09,187 --> 01:21:12,607
Right. I'm ready.
- Camera running.

842
01:21:12,648 --> 01:21:14,650
3, 2, 1...

843
01:21:16,611 --> 01:21:18,529
Berlin.

844
01:21:27,663 --> 01:21:29,623
Still running.

845
01:21:29,665 --> 01:21:31,458
Berlin.

846
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:36,505
In a historic special session of the
Central Committee of the Social Unity Party of Germany...

847
01:21:36,589 --> 01:21:41,343
the General Secretary of the SUG's CC
and Chairman of the GDR's Council of State,

848
01:21:41,427 --> 01:21:45,514
Comrade Erich Honecker, in a great matter of humanitarian politeness,

849
01:21:45,556 --> 01:21:52,104
consented to the entering of the country by people from the FRG
who've been requesting exile at the GDR embassies in Prague and Budapest.

850
01:21:52,187 --> 01:21:54,148
In this development, Honecker sees...

851
01:21:54,189 --> 01:21:56,483
a change in the East-West-relations
and promised every man and woman entering the country...

852
01:21:56,483 --> 01:21:58,360
a change in the East-West-relations
and promised every man and woman entering the country...

853
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,238
a welcome money of 200 East Marks.

854
01:22:01,238 --> 01:22:05,075
Unemployment,
bad future prospects...

855
01:22:05,075 --> 01:22:08,912
and the increasing election victories
of the neo-Nazi Republicans...

856
01:22:08,912 --> 01:22:13,125
made the unnerved FRG citizens
turn their backs

857
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:17,128
on the capitalism to
try and start...

858
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:20,757
a new life in the country of workers and farmers.

859
01:22:23,176 --> 01:22:27,055
Here they park,
the new GDR citizens from the FRG.

860
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:31,142
The entering FRG citizens
were accommodated in the Berlin districts...

861
01:22:31,184 --> 01:22:35,146
"Center" und "Friedrich's Grove".
The CC of the SUG...

862
01:22:35,188 --> 01:22:40,527
created the campaign "Solidarity West"
because of the historic situation,

863
01:22:40,568 --> 01:22:45,114
to make sure all the new citizens
receive proper living space.

864
01:22:45,156 --> 01:22:49,118
Somehow I have to admit
that my game started to break free.

865
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:53,122
Maybe the GDR I created for my mother,
was the one I would have liked to have.

866
01:22:53,164 --> 01:22:57,126
Citizens who are ready
to accommodate a refugee from the FRG,

867
01:22:57,168 --> 01:23:01,631
please report to their
Section Plenipotentiary.

868
01:23:03,508 --> 01:23:06,385
How many are there already?

869
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,597
I don't know. Ten, twenty thousand?

870
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:14,143
Look at that.
The people want to come into our country.

871
01:23:14,185 --> 01:23:18,147
Where are they all going to live?
- They'll find something.

872
01:23:18,189 --> 01:23:21,150
You've heard it, they're taking care of it.

873
01:23:22,443 --> 01:23:26,447
No, children. This is our responsibility.
We have to help.

874
01:23:27,156 --> 01:23:31,744
But how do you think we can?
I mean, there's no room left in here.

875
01:23:33,245 --> 01:23:36,248
Our holiday home.
- Our holiday home?

876
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:42,296
We could do it up.
I wanted to get out there anyway.

877
01:23:42,963 --> 01:23:49,178
Congratulations. You've done a great job.
Now she wants to go to the holiday home.

878
01:23:50,637 --> 01:23:54,600
You'll have to redecorate the entire City.
Why don't you start?

879
01:23:54,641 --> 01:23:58,645
But I'm telling you one thing,
I won't take this any further.

880
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:06,611
Ariane and I'll get a bigger apartment.
In 4 weeks we're out of here.

881
01:24:06,653 --> 01:24:08,905
What?

882
01:24:08,947 --> 01:24:11,575
I'm pregnant.

883
01:24:16,496 --> 01:24:20,500
Again?
Can't you be more careful?

884
01:24:22,585 --> 01:24:25,547
Don't you think Paula is enough? And Mum?

885
01:24:26,172 --> 01:24:31,428
You can't leave me alone!
- Then take some refugees.

886
01:24:31,469 --> 01:24:35,473
You're so cynical.
You want her to die, don't you?

887
01:24:44,565 --> 01:24:49,779
And so the unity of our little
family was restored.

888
01:24:52,156 --> 01:24:55,159
That's your child. And this is the heart.

889
01:25:00,498 --> 01:25:03,084
Amazing!

890
01:25:03,584 --> 01:25:06,587
An all-German baby was on its way.
And all-German contracts...

891
01:25:06,587 --> 01:25:07,964
An all-German baby was on its way.
And all-German contracts...

892
01:25:07,964 --> 01:25:11,801
were signed.
In Moskow, they calculated

893
01:25:11,801 --> 01:25:17,556
that 2 and 4 equals one and drank
Krim Champagne to all-German brotherhood.

894
01:25:17,807 --> 01:25:23,020
In Berlin we took our
first all-German trip.

895
01:25:26,148 --> 01:25:30,110
I'm not a little child anymore.
Please take off the cloth.

896
01:25:30,152 --> 01:25:32,780
Don't look!

897
01:25:33,405 --> 01:25:37,409
Where are we going?
- The surprise stays a surprise!

898
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:42,122
The Trabbi (GDR car) smells so new.
What colour does it have?

899
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:47,127
You've waited 3 years,
another half an hour won't make a difference. - That's right.

900
01:26:17,991 --> 01:26:19,784
Mum?

901
01:26:34,841 --> 01:26:38,219
Oh, it's beautiful. Sky-blue.

902
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:41,097
Right, and now turn around.

903
01:26:44,809 --> 01:26:48,479
Oh my god. The garden.

904
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:52,608
Remember the time Alex
locked himself in the bathroom?

905
01:26:52,608 --> 01:26:55,486
We knocked and knocked. Not a sound.

906
01:26:55,486 --> 01:26:56,946
I climbed out of a hole
and watched all the excitement from the tree.

907
01:26:56,946 --> 01:26:59,657
I climbed out of a hole
and watched all the excitement from the tree.

908
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:03,661
And I laughed so hard,
I wet myself.

909
01:27:10,334 --> 01:27:14,964
What's happened in the 8 months
I overslept?

910
01:27:15,005 --> 01:27:17,591
Is she asleep? - Yeah.

911
01:27:21,345 --> 01:27:25,307
You've become adults,
that must be it.

912
01:27:26,058 --> 01:27:27,768
You look more and more like your father.

913
01:27:27,768 --> 01:27:29,103
You look more and more like your father.

914
01:27:37,236 --> 01:27:38,695
Mum...

915
01:27:38,904 --> 01:27:42,824
I've lied to you all this time.
It's all different from what you think.

916
01:27:42,866 --> 01:27:45,869
Mum, what are you talking about?
- Your father...

917
01:27:50,874 --> 01:27:54,878
Your father didn't stay in the West
because of another woman.

918
01:27:55,545 --> 01:27:59,549
I lied.
And I also lied about...

919
01:28:03,553 --> 01:28:06,431
not hearing anything from him again.

920
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:09,976
He wrote letters to me... and to you.

921
01:28:11,144 --> 01:28:14,773
They're all... in the kitchen cupboard.

922
01:28:21,654 --> 01:28:26,242
They made things so hard for him.
Just because he wasn't in the party.

923
01:28:26,284 --> 01:28:30,872
It was dreadful.
He didn't let anyone notice.

924
01:28:32,165 --> 01:28:35,043
But I knew.

925
01:28:35,168 --> 01:28:39,172
I... knew
and I couldn't help him.

926
01:28:41,966 --> 01:28:46,554
And then... there suddenly was
this congress in West Berlin.

927
01:28:48,097 --> 01:28:51,684
We only had 2 days to think.

928
01:28:53,019 --> 01:28:56,856
Your father wanted to stay in
the West and I...

929
01:28:56,897 --> 01:28:59,859
I was supposed to follow with you.

930
01:29:04,155 --> 01:29:07,158
Well, I couldn't do it.

931
01:29:10,286 --> 01:29:13,289
I... I was very frightened.

932
01:29:15,165 --> 01:29:19,128
You don't know, how it is.
Filling in an exit permit...

933
01:29:19,169 --> 01:29:23,507
with 2 children. You can't get out immediately.
You have to wait - endlessly!

934
01:29:23,549 --> 01:29:26,552
Sometimes even years. And you...

935
01:29:27,594 --> 01:29:31,598
They could have taken you away from me.
Do you understand?

936
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:40,857
Yes.

937
01:29:41,984 --> 01:29:44,945
I didn't go.

938
01:29:47,239 --> 01:29:50,700
It was the worst mistake of my life.

939
01:29:50,742 --> 01:29:53,370
I know that now.

940
01:29:54,663 --> 01:29:58,250
I lied to you. Please forgive me!

941
01:30:19,479 --> 01:30:22,357
My dear Robert...

942
01:30:24,234 --> 01:30:27,236
I thought about you so often...

943
01:30:29,155 --> 01:30:32,742
I would so much like to
see you once more.

944
01:31:10,863 --> 01:31:14,867
The same evening
mother's condition suddenly worsened.

945
01:32:21,474 --> 01:32:25,520
Your mother had another heart attack,
just as I feared.

946
01:32:25,561 --> 01:32:29,565
At the moment, she's relatively stable.
But I'm afraid...

947
01:32:31,275 --> 01:32:35,279
we have to expect the worst.
I'm sorry.

948
01:32:42,578 --> 01:32:46,499
The doctors can be wrong.
- Alex, don't lie to yourself.

949
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:50,419
Here, I found it.
He lives in Wannlake.

950
01:32:53,172 --> 01:32:59,094
I know, it's her last wish.
But I couldn't bring myself to go there.

951
01:33:02,681 --> 01:33:05,559
Mum's not going to die.

952
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:10,814
Bye.

953
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:51,896
Now you can accommodate someone after all.

954
01:33:54,733 --> 01:33:57,318
Accommodate? Who?

955
01:33:57,569 --> 01:34:00,447
Someone from the West.

956
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:25,847
You have to sleep.

957
01:34:28,558 --> 01:34:32,436
If you want you you can sleep
lie down in the nurses' room.

958
01:35:10,057 --> 01:35:13,018
There he was. The idol of my youth.

959
01:35:13,477 --> 01:35:15,646
Like a conjured spirit
from my childhood: Sigmund Jähn.

960
01:35:15,646 --> 01:35:17,898
Like a conjured spirit
of my childhood Sigmund Jähn.

961
01:35:17,898 --> 01:35:23,153
He didn't give autographs, he didn't
talk to Pioneers about the secrets of the universe,

962
01:35:23,153 --> 01:35:26,990
the freedom you have in zero gravity
or the eternity of the cosmos.

963
01:35:27,157 --> 01:35:32,120
He drove a small, stinking Lada-Taxi.
- Where do you want to go?

964
01:35:32,162 --> 01:35:35,123
To Wannlake.
- I know what you're thinking.

965
01:35:35,165 --> 01:35:39,044
That's what many people think.
But that's not who I am.

966
01:35:39,169 --> 01:35:43,131
We were flying through the night.
Just like through the depths of the cosmos.

967
01:35:43,173 --> 01:35:47,135
Light-years away from the solar system,
past strange galaxies...

968
01:35:47,177 --> 01:35:51,139
with unknown lifeforms,
we landed in Wannlake.

969
01:35:51,431 --> 01:35:54,434
Could you wait a moment?

970
01:35:57,812 --> 01:36:00,398
I won't be long.

971
01:36:10,283 --> 01:36:13,161
Good evening.
- Hello. Come in.

972
01:36:16,539 --> 01:36:20,168
Is Mr. Kerner there?
- The buffet is outside. - Over there.

973
01:36:25,882 --> 01:36:28,467
Hello.

974
01:36:37,351 --> 01:36:38,936
Good evening.

975
01:36:45,151 --> 01:36:46,944
Hello! Good evening!

976
01:36:50,531 --> 01:36:52,324
Hello!

977
01:36:58,163 --> 01:37:03,919
Sandman, dear Sandman,
it isn't time yet...

978
01:37:03,961 --> 01:37:08,173
We send the evening greetings...

979
01:37:08,549 --> 01:37:11,885
before all the children have to go to bed.

980
01:37:11,969 --> 01:37:12,844
You surely have time left.

981
01:37:12,844 --> 01:37:15,013
You surely have time left.

982
01:37:17,891 --> 01:37:21,228
Hello.
- Hello. - Hello.

983
01:37:21,228 --> 01:37:24,606
May I watch the Sandman with you?
- Only if you tell us your name.

984
01:37:24,606 --> 01:37:25,107
May I watch the Sandman with you?
- Only if you tell us your name.

985
01:37:25,148 --> 01:37:27,734
Alexander.

986
01:37:33,156 --> 01:37:37,035
Look,
today the sandman is an astronaut.

987
01:37:37,535 --> 01:37:40,497
Where I come from it's called cosmonaut.

988
01:37:40,538 --> 01:37:44,417
Where do you come from?
- From a different country.

989
01:37:47,170 --> 01:37:50,131
Hi, you little bears.
- Hello, Dad.

990
01:37:50,173 --> 01:37:53,051
Hello. How are you?

991
01:37:53,176 --> 01:37:55,803
Fine.

992
01:37:58,223 --> 01:38:01,226
So, are you also a fan of the Sandman?

993
01:38:01,309 --> 01:38:03,895
Yes, I am.

994
01:38:07,565 --> 01:38:11,569
Excuse me, do we know each other?
- Yes, we do.

995
01:38:12,862 --> 01:38:16,491
Yes. I can't think of it.
Please help me.

996
01:38:16,866 --> 01:38:19,452
His name's Alexander.

997
01:38:26,751 --> 01:38:28,336
Alex?

998
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:36,594
Robert. Robert!
We're all waiting for you out here.

999
01:38:36,635 --> 01:38:39,096
Robert, come out!

1000
01:38:39,138 --> 01:38:43,601
Robert, we all know that you like to hide
in the bathroom on these occasions.

1001
01:38:49,565 --> 01:38:53,777
Dad, you have to give your speech.
- Robert, come out here.

1002
01:38:53,819 --> 01:38:56,697
I'll be back.

1003
01:39:01,618 --> 01:39:05,622
Oh, I see him.
You've kept us waiting.

1004
01:39:06,874 --> 01:39:09,751
Onto the stage!

1005
01:39:14,506 --> 01:39:18,844
Well, I thank you
all for coming here.

1006
01:39:18,844 --> 01:39:21,221
Thank you and...

1007
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:24,599
enjoy the evening. Thanks.

1008
01:39:24,599 --> 01:39:26,268
enjoy the evening. Thanks.

1009
01:39:36,152 --> 01:39:40,115
I'm sorry for having this
party here tonight.

1010
01:39:40,156 --> 01:39:43,743
Had I known you'd come, I...

1011
01:39:47,163 --> 01:39:51,125
Strange, I've always thought you've got
a swimming pool.

1012
01:39:51,167 --> 01:39:56,839
We've got a lake nearby.
My god, I didn't even recognize you.

1013
01:40:03,137 --> 01:40:06,766
Now I got 2 new brothers and sisters, hm?

1014
01:40:15,149 --> 01:40:20,321
For 3 years, every day I waited
for a message from you.

1015
01:40:20,363 --> 01:40:22,156
Every day.

1016
01:40:23,574 --> 01:40:27,161
It was my most fervent wish.

1017
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:40,758
Why have you come?

1018
01:40:46,138 --> 01:40:49,016
Mum's dying.

1019
01:40:50,225 --> 01:40:53,103
She had a heart attack.

1020
01:40:53,854 --> 01:40:56,732
She wants to see you once more.

1021
01:41:12,748 --> 01:41:15,751
What was it like up there?
- Up there?

1022
01:41:19,963 --> 01:41:22,549
Oh... up there.

1023
01:41:25,302 --> 01:41:28,179
It was wonderful up there.

1024
01:41:28,805 --> 01:41:31,766
Just very far away from home.

1025
01:41:38,148 --> 01:41:42,152
The Wall is no more.
There's no frontier!

1026
01:41:42,986 --> 01:41:45,488
It's not that bad.
It's all just one country now!

1027
01:41:46,281 --> 01:41:50,285
I don't understand a word. It's all untrue.
- That's why you have to play along.

1028
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:54,122
And why did I come back to the GDR?

1029
01:41:54,163 --> 01:41:57,750
I don't know. Just think of something!

1030
01:42:01,295 --> 01:42:04,298
No, it's absurd. I can't do that.

1031
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:08,928
You just have to overcome it,
then it'll be easy.

1032
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:35,746
Mum.
- Yes.

1033
01:42:36,163 --> 01:42:37,957
Ouch.

1034
01:43:03,398 --> 01:43:05,984
I want to get up.

1035
01:43:06,485 --> 01:43:09,071
How do I look?

1036
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:20,916
You can go in now.

1037
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:27,047
And please remember, not a word!
- Yes, yes.

1038
01:43:36,973 --> 01:43:42,186
What did you talk about?
- Is that important?

1039
01:43:56,951 --> 01:44:00,955
How long has he been in there?
- More than an hour.

1040
01:44:05,167 --> 01:44:08,129
I hope he doesn't let the cat out of the bag.

1041
01:44:11,132 --> 01:44:16,846
The summer was over. I decided to end
the whole sham.

1042
01:44:17,138 --> 01:44:21,892
But once more we were about
to celebrate the anniversary of our socialist Fatherland.

1043
01:44:21,934 --> 01:44:26,480
But in contrast to reality...
as a dignified farewell.

1044
01:44:39,535 --> 01:44:41,120
Pst!

1045
01:44:49,878 --> 01:44:52,881
Yes? Camera running. Start at 3.

1046
01:44:58,887 --> 01:45:03,809
Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.

1047
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:07,813
If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...

1048
01:45:07,854 --> 01:45:10,398
from the depths of the cosmos...

1049
01:45:21,701 --> 01:45:25,955
As mum hardly couldn't wait,
we simply moved the GDR's anniversary...

1050
01:45:25,997 --> 01:45:31,169
from October 7 to October 2, 1990:
The eve of the reunification.

1051
01:45:51,939 --> 01:45:53,524
And?

1052
01:45:53,941 --> 01:45:56,944
Here. My best film yet, buddy.

1053
01:45:57,153 --> 01:46:01,115
Too bad no one but your mother
will ever see it.

1054
01:46:01,157 --> 01:46:05,119
Thank you, Denis. Without you, it would never...
- Yeah, it's alright. Here you go.

1055
01:46:05,161 --> 01:46:08,122
Zoom off, before it gets sentimental.

1056
01:46:08,956 --> 01:46:11,083
And tell me how it was!

1057
01:46:11,167 --> 01:46:16,172
On the occasion of today's annual anniversary of the GDR,
Erich Honecker resigned...

1058
01:46:16,213 --> 01:46:19,091
from all his functions.

1059
01:46:19,258 --> 01:46:20,843
What?

1060
01:46:20,968 --> 01:46:25,097
We ensure our friends in the world
that the socialism...

1061
01:46:25,139 --> 01:46:29,101
(Reporter) In his speech on the ceremony for
the GDR's anniversary...

1062
01:46:29,143 --> 01:46:33,105
in the Republic's palace, Erich Honecker
justified his decision by saying that

1063
01:46:33,147 --> 01:46:37,109
the changes achieved in the GDR in the past few months...

1064
01:46:37,151 --> 01:46:41,113
completed his political life's work.
Erich Honecker congratulated...

1065
01:46:41,155 --> 01:46:46,076
the new SED's CC General Secretary and
Chairman of the GDR's council of state:

1066
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:49,037
Sigmund Jähn.
- What, Jähn?

1067
01:46:49,162 --> 01:46:54,334
In 1978, Sigmund Jähn was the first German
cosmonaut in space.

1068
01:46:54,960 --> 01:47:00,132
The new head of state addressed the
GDR's population in the evening.

1069
01:47:01,967 --> 01:47:07,889
Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.

1070
01:47:08,139 --> 01:47:12,102
If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...

1071
01:47:12,143 --> 01:47:17,357
from the depths of the cosmos,
you see things differently.

1072
01:47:18,566 --> 01:47:20,819
Up there, in the depths of space,
the people's lives...

1073
01:47:20,819 --> 01:47:22,654
Up there, in the depths of space,
the people's lives...

1074
01:47:22,654 --> 01:47:27,951
seem small and insignificant. You ask yourself
what humanity has accomplished.

1075
01:47:27,951 --> 01:47:32,247
Which objectives did we set,
which objectives did we realize?

1076
01:47:32,455 --> 01:47:35,416
Today is our country's anniversary.

1077
01:47:35,458 --> 01:47:39,087
It's a very little country,
seen from the cosmos.

1078
01:47:39,128 --> 01:47:43,091
But still thousands of people
came to us last year.

1079
01:47:43,132 --> 01:47:48,221
People who we looked to as enemies and
who want to live here with us today.

1080
01:47:48,262 --> 01:47:53,100
We know our country is not perfect.
But what we believe in,

1081
01:47:53,142 --> 01:47:57,104
inspired a lot of people
in the whole world.

1082
01:47:57,146 --> 01:48:01,108
Maybe we have drifted off course
from time to time.

1083
01:48:01,150 --> 01:48:05,112
But we collected ourselves.
Socialism doesn't mean

1084
01:48:05,154 --> 01:48:09,575
living behind a wall. Socialism means
reaching out to others,

1085
01:48:09,617 --> 01:48:14,079
and living with others. Not just to dream
about a better world,

1086
01:48:14,163 --> 01:48:16,123
but to make the world a better place.

1087
01:48:16,123 --> 01:48:17,875
but making it a better world.

1088
01:48:17,875 --> 01:48:21,712
I have therefore decided
to open the GDR borders.

1089
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:26,967
Shortly after the Fall of the Wall,
thousands of FRG citizens...

1090
01:48:27,217 --> 01:48:31,805
seized the opportunity
to visit the GDR for the first time.

1091
01:48:36,143 --> 01:48:40,105
Many want to stay. They're looking
for an alternative to...

1092
01:48:40,147 --> 01:48:45,110
the hard battle for survival in the capitalistic system.
- Isn't that wonderful?

1093
01:48:45,152 --> 01:48:49,114
Not everyone wants to join in with career addiction and
aggressive marketing.

1094
01:48:49,156 --> 01:48:53,160
Not everyone wants
to fight his way through life.

1095
01:48:57,164 --> 01:49:01,042
(Song) Such a day,
so wonderful like today...

1096
01:49:01,626 --> 01:49:05,755
These people want a different life.
They realize that cars,

1097
01:49:05,797 --> 01:49:10,593
video recorders and TVs are not everything.
They are ready to

1098
01:49:10,635 --> 01:49:16,307
realize a new life with nothing but
good will, vigour and hope.

1099
01:49:21,354 --> 01:49:23,147
Amazing.

1100
01:50:33,133 --> 01:50:36,720
My mother survived the GDR
by 3 days.

1101
01:50:37,137 --> 01:50:41,099
I guess it was the right thing,
that she never did learn the truth.

1102
01:50:41,141 --> 01:50:44,019
She died happily.

1103
01:50:45,562 --> 01:50:49,483
She wished for us to
scatter her ashes to the four winds.

1104
01:50:49,524 --> 01:50:55,238
That's not allowed in Germany.
Not in the West and not in the East. But we didn't care.

1105
01:51:28,938 --> 01:51:33,109
Up there she is floating and
maybe she is looking down at us.

1106
01:51:33,151 --> 01:51:37,113
And sees us as tiny
dots on our little Earth.

1107
01:51:37,155 --> 01:51:40,116
Just like Sigmund Jähn back then.

1108
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:48,082
The country my mother left
was a country she had believed in

1109
01:51:48,457 --> 01:51:52,461
and which we kept alive
until her last second.

1110
01:51:53,295 --> 01:51:57,299
A country that in fact never existed like this.

1111
01:51:58,926 --> 01:52:04,890
A country that in my memory
will always be connected to my mother.
