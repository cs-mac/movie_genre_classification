1
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:45,461
When you forge a weapon,
you need three things.

2
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:50,174
The right metal, temperatures
over 1,400 degrees,

3
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,719
and someone
who wants to kill.

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,472
Here in Jungle Village, we got all three.

5
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,594
Bring out the weapons!

6
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,538
Jungle Village.

7
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,920
A heartless place.

8
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,593
Ruled by many savage clans.

9
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:26,849
Constantly at war.

10
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,357
Me, I'm just a blacksmith.

11
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,615
Minding my own business.

12
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,369
And biding my time.

13
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,458
I never wanted to make tools for killing,

14
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,004
but I made the sacrifice
for the woman I love.

15
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,801
Lady Silk.

16
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:07,390
She's a worker at the Pink Blossom,

17
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,187
and my only refuge in this hellhole.

18
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,733
Together, we had decided
to leave this place,

19
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:22,154
but it turns out that the
universe had other plans.

20
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:30,621
Fate twisted when Gold Lion,

21
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,416
the mighty leader of the Lion Clan,

22
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,711
was summoned to the governor's palace.

23
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,690
The governor gave him a mission

24
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,400
to protect the shipment of gold

25
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:03,279
that he was sending through Jungle
Village to his troops in the North.

26
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,201
Gold Lion accepted.
He gave his word.

27
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,205
But when it comes to money,

28
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,374
things get funny.

29
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,591
Gold Lion! Gold Lion!

30
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,722
Gold Lion was betrayed
by his own lieutenants,

31
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,141
Silver and Bronze.

32
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:36,353
Now, the only thing that
stood in their way was Zen Yi,

33
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,356
Gold Lion's favorite son.

34
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,697
But Zen Yi was about to get the news

35
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:51,118
that would forever change
all of our destinies.

36
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,663
Chi Chi, I will never leave your side.

37
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,298
And I will return immediately home

38
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,092
to ask my father to
arrange our marriage.

39
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,516
Zen Yi! Zen Yi! Zen Yi!

40
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,851
Chan.

41
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,355
I have terrible news from home.

42
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,941
It's your father.

43
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:33,869
No.

44
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,009
You said you would
never leave my side.

45
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,642
Master, the horses are ready.

46
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,447
If I don't avenge my father's
death, we'll never be safe.

47
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,629
Yah!

48
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,183
Hyah!

49
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,417
Brothers, I am truly humbled
to be your new leader.

50
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,930
Now, my Lions, we must
keep Gold Lion's word

51
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,141
to protect the governor's gold.

52
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,936
Our enemies have surely
heard of Gold Lion's death,

53
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,565
and it is my belief that the Wolf
Clan, protectors of the West Gate,

54
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,653
thinking we're vulnerable, will attack.

55
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:35,783
Instead of waiting, I say we strike
first and take them by surprise.

56
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:39,244
Brothers, should we not
wait for Zen Yi to return?

57
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,038
We will definitely need his strength.

58
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,414
I agree.

59
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,583
You agree?

60
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,305
Are we not the Lions?

61
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,848
Hmm?

62
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,604
Are we not the strongest?

63
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,272
- Huh?
- Yes!

64
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:11,527
I say we move with
power and strike now!

65
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,611
Yes!

66
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,616
Put the fire out.

67
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,789
A dozen of these by tonight.

68
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,339
Three days.

69
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,842
Three days?

70
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,802
Why so long?

71
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,058
Hey! Never turn your back on a wolf.

72
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,227
Or it will bite you in the ass.

73
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,938
For the weapon that you desire,

74
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,315
it's going to take three days.

75
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,279
Unless you want some shit like that.

76
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,989
Two days or you're dead.

77
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,034
Hyah! Huh!

78
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,486
The Chinese have a saying.

79
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,530
"Dangerous men will meet in our streets."

80
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,366
And so it was.

81
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,411
War raged between the clans,

82
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:48,332
and that meant pressure
on me to make more weapons.

83
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,004
And as word of the
gold shipment spread,

84
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,592
strangers suddenly
appeared in Jungle Village.

85
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,167
God bless you.

86
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,043
To my illness.

87
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,503
Cheers.

88
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,299
An English gent.

89
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,509
The gentlest.

90
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,303
Are you military?

91
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,347
How long did you spend in France?

92
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,975
Long enough to recognize
a man of refined tastes.

93
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,561
You've come to the right
place to rest your bones.

94
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,856
Merci, Madame, but I'm not here for rest.

95
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,776
I should like a private room with
a bath, a view over the main road,

96
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,987
a bottle of that liquor,

97
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,947
and three of your finest.

98
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,867
Only three? Subtle.

99
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,578
Well, to start with.

100
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,288
I don't want to appear greedy.

101
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,664
Mmm.

102
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,460
A man with much chi.

103
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,795
Prepare the South Suite for our guest.

104
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,468
Please, girls, the gentleman has just arrived.

105
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,221
Give him a chance to
choose his own pleasures.

106
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,347
Hmm.

107
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,184
Yes, you.

108
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,104
And you.

109
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,941
And her.

110
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,363
Sir, I'm afraid she's
with another customer.

111
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,407
Yes, but it's the wrong customer.

112
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,625
"Journeys end with lovers meeting,

113
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,835
"as every wise man's son doth know."

114
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,004
My dear,

115
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,885
you are about to suffer what no
young lady should have to endure.

116
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,553
Come.

117
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:59,147
I seek no quarrel with you,
my stout fellow.

118
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,650
I am merely trying to save this damsel

119
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:06,238
from what would be the most
traumatic experience of her young life.

120
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,282
If you'll excuse us.

121
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,837
It doesn't have to be that way.

122
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,673
It doesn't have to be that way at all.

123
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,897
Ooh.

124
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,526
My name is Mr. Knife!

125
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:51,199
You may call me Jack.

126
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:57,497
I have come to your fine
village for a vacation.

127
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,626
I do not wish to be disturbed!

128
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:07,632
My lady.

129
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,555
Shall I have the other half of
Crazy Hippo delivered to your suite?

130
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,143
Feed him to your dogs.
It will make them taste better.

131
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,269
I was worried about you.

132
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,648
Bring me some golden nectar.
Quickly.

133
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,070
Darling, what's wrong?

134
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,872
I'll be fine.

135
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,916
Those men are savages.

136
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,044
Why do you work yourself
to death for their sake?

137
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,715
I don't do it for them.

138
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,427
I do it for you.

139
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,783
Another day, another dollar.

140
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:03,081
Lady Silk was happy, and we
were getting closer to our goal.

141
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:11,256
Meanwhile, Zen Yi was getting
closer to Jungle Village.

142
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,792
You bring us your best food and wine.

143
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,924
Master, I think it might be the crabapples.

144
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,801
Outhouse is back.
Thank you.

145
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,350
Poor X-Blade.
No blades, just an "X."

146
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,062
You'll be joining
your father in hell today.

147
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,375
Who sent you?

148
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,760
Kiss my ring.

149
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,348
Long live Silver Lion. Hmm.

150
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,523
Mr. Ming is here.

151
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,986
We'll finish this later.

152
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,326
The 10 Rodents couldn't handle Zen Yi.

153
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,287
Perhaps you should have sent 20.

154
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,249
The government shipment is only days away.

155
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,794
Fifty-thousand taels of gold bullion.

156
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,714
Still, capturing it won't be easy.

157
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:25,218
It's being escorted by the Gemini killers.

158
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,652
If we hit the shipment

159
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,655
and the gold doesn't reach
the northern rendezvous point,

160
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,323
the government will send in their forces.

161
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,033
Exactly.

162
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,869
And to make matters worse,

163
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,831
the emperor's secret emissary has
been sent here to assist the troops.

164
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,083
And not even I know what he is capable of.

165
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,794
Or, for that matter, who he is.

166
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,287
Yeah.

167
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,583
Yes?

168
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,668
Compliments of the house.

169
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,588
How kind.

170
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,174
Is everything to your satisfaction?

171
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,011
So far, so good.

172
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,556
Shall I send up more girls?

173
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,019
What if I just cut these ones in half?

174
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,187
Mmm?

175
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,023
If you damage my girls,

176
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,070
I'll damage your boys.

177
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,113
Good God, that hurts.

178
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,200
In a very pleasurable way.

179
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,747
What if I put the baby's arm inside you?

180
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,333
Must be very good opium.

181
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,009
What are you looking at, dirty little man?

182
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:46,693
Now, ladies, let me have a quick look.

183
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,611
That is a good look.

184
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,620
Wet! You have been a
naughty, naughty girl.

185
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,746
Oh!

186
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,040
You shall stay tied up like that

187
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:06,462
till at least 6:00.
You wanna come?

188
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:18,808
Right, I think it's time
for some more games. Yeah.

189
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,607
I'll start over here with the navy.

190
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:43,082
Things were heating up in Jungle Village.

191
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,753
I was finishing the weapons for the Wolves,

192
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,006
while they were partying to a full moon.

193
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,052
Every dog has its night.

194
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:02,352
And Zen Yi, the X-Blade,
burning with vengeance,

195
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:05,855
was just one day away from our village.

196
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,651
Sounds like company is approaching.

197
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,989
Smells like Lions.

198
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,253
Zen Yi.

199
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,215
Brothers, what are you doing here?

200
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,051
We've come to escort you home.

201
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,887
Chan, tie their horses
and bring them drinks.

202
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,722
Yes, master.

203
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,810
Silver Lion is no longer the same.
He's changed.

204
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,311
Your father wanted peace.

205
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,105
Silver Lion wants war.

206
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,295
As I figured, a sheep in wolf's clothing.

207
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,589
No!

208
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,847
"No!"

209
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,195
Wolves?
More like wet dogs.

210
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,700
You are lucky you only have one customer.

211
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,493
No need to be jealous.

212
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,589
The Lion Clan killed every
member of the Wolf clan.

213
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,507
They now control the West Gate.

214
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,601
Everyone's so afraid of these men.
Are you?

215
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,312
I'm not afraid.

216
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,856
Well, you should be.

217
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,401
These men are ruthless and vicious.

218
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,238
Give me my sword and I'll
leave this place. And go where?

219
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,366
Anywhere my hands won't be used
to make tools that kill anyone.

220
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,786
This place is not so bad.

221
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,248
Under the right circumstances
it could be paradise.

222
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,417
Paradise? This place?

223
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,484
Hey, little one.

224
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:01,948
Another one.

225
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,723
The Gemini killers will arrive with
the governor's gold by sunrise.

226
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,894
Our plans are in place.
We're ready for them.

227
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,020
Good.

228
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,941
Well, that leaves one remaining issue.

229
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,610
Zen Yi.

230
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,494
Mr. Kwon, so pleased to see you.

231
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,415
Silver Lion.

232
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,461
Brass Body.

233
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,465
It's nice to see a familiar face.

234
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:06,137
"The Snake Charmer."
Your best work yet.

235
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,513
Thank you.

236
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,974
However, this next job will not be so easy.

237
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,559
Is that so?

238
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,729
Zen Yi has become a thorn in the Lion's paw.

239
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,064
That's what happens when you
send mice to do a man's job.

240
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,942
You bring us another trophy,

241
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,571
I'll double it.

242
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,794
Zen Yi's blades will have no effect on me.

243
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,973
Should we go straight to base?

244
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,017
We'll post up at the Dragon Inn.

245
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:23,839
Wakey-wakey, little blossoms.
Wakey-wakey.

246
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,092
Go on.

247
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:30,221
Now, if you're good,

248
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,765
we can play a game called,

249
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,060
"Let's pretend we're Catholic."

250
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:42,483
And I'll see if I can find
the heretic amongst you.

251
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,780
Let's start now.

252
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,068
Master Zen Yi.

253
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,778
My private room, please.

254
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,656
Of course.
This way.

255
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:38,038
Chan, give this to Silver Lion.

256
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,001
And hurry back.

257
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,506
That should satisfy Madam Blossom.

258
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,928
She will no longer be your master.

259
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:56,265
No, she won't.
Thank you.

260
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,855
We should pack our bags and
leave this place immediately.

261
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,982
What's the rush?

262
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,069
Let us have one last moment here.

263
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,530
Before we go.

264
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,252
Twenty-three, 24, 25.

265
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,465
Why 25?

266
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:35,429
Well, the earth is 25,000 miles in circumference.

267
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,932
So smart.

268
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,018
Strong hands.

269
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,646
You're so beautiful.

270
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,860
How about we get Madam Blossom
in for a threesome before we go?

271
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:58,661
Hurry, hurry.

272
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,838
Silver Lion should be here by now.

273
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:12,716
He knows we're here, and his
tardiness says more than his presence.

274
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,971
Don't come in!
Don't come in! Stop!

275
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,640
Stop, stop, stop, come back!

276
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,996
No!

277
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,607
Brother!

278
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,688
X-Blade,

279
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,525
you're a dead man.

280
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,487
No!

281
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,180
Zen Yi.

282
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,093
Well, Gold Lion was dead,

283
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,179
and Zen Yi was out of commission.

284
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:49,141
Now, there was all eyes on the Geminis,

285
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,311
who arrived in town with the governor's gold.

286
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,940
Their plan was to post up at
Dragon Inn, spend the night,

287
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,609
and continue north.

288
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,745
I've cleared everybody out,
just as you requested.

289
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,915
I'm looking forward to your
famous Cantonese braised ribs.

290
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,125
I knew you would ask.

291
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,381
It's already prepared.

292
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,764
Well?

293
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,766
Spicy.

294
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,060
Oh, good.

295
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,937
Upstairs.

296
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,607
You're still as lovely as ever.

297
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,400
Please.

298
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,710
You look beautiful, Jackie.
Like a Chinese warrior.

299
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,596
Me likey.

300
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,029
Master Silver Lion.

301
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:30,576
I'm sorry, we're closed for the day.

302
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,287
Oh, you are never closed to the Lion Clan.

303
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,914
Now, where are the Geminis?

304
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,715
Please, no trouble.

305
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,553
Trouble?

306
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,102
Mr. And Mrs. Gemini.

307
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,153
How are they?

308
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,989
Spicy.

309
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,790
Where's your boss, Gold Lion?

310
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,085
Unfortunately, he couldn't make it.

311
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,090
What do you want here, Silver Lion?

312
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,760
Oh, you know what we want.

313
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,149
Friends, there's really no need
for your journey to end here.

314
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,443
And by that, I mean your life journey.

315
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,280
You give us the gold,
we spare you and your men.

316
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,993
And maybe we will invite you
to join us and live like royalty

317
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,162
here in our lovely village.

318
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,333
A dog living in a palace is still a dog.

319
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,926
And every dog loves to chase the pussycat.

320
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,215
The Gemini stance.

321
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,451
Poison Dagger.

322
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,287
Where are you?
Come out!

323
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,957
Come out!

324
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:23,261
Ah, no more, no more.

325
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:26,181
Go. We are closed.
Forever.

326
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,520
The Lions do this.
See what they did to my inn!

327
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,484
You want Lion?
I cook you Lion.

328
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,029
How would you like it?

329
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,240
Steamed? Deep fried?

330
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,035
Pan fried? Ah!
Lion dumpling?

331
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,081
I was hoping for one last
dish of your Emperor Sui Duck.

332
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,262
We haven't prepared that dish in years.

333
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,724
Seasoned with young basil, and Yangzi grains.

334
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,270
The dish is for very special customers.

335
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,980
Please.

336
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,986
What kind of Lion is this?

337
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,073
Not Lions. Gemini.

338
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,618
A very pretty one at that.

339
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,165
Such a shame.

340
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,382
Mercury.

341
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,139
The mark of Poison Dagger.

342
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,727
Who in this village would
have access to mercury?

343
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,437
Our blacksmith.

344
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,564
But he's not from here.

345
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,233
His weapons are very dangerous.

346
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:02,986
Well,

347
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,407
I'm only here for the duck.

348
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,744
As if bad things couldn't get worse,

349
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,415
word got to the governor that
the Lions ambushed the gold.

350
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:19,836
This enraged him, and he called
in the fierce Jackal troops.

351
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,505
Now, these motherfuckers had a Gatling gun

352
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,009
and more bullets than China had rice.

353
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,761
He gave them an order.

354
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,680
If one tael of gold was missing,

355
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,684
they was to burn Jungle
Village to the ground.

356
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,202
Prepare these herbs.

357
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,210
Why are you helping me?

358
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,463
Because I forged the weapons
that killed your father.

359
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,924
I regret that.

360
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:15,475
Brother, don't avert your energy.

361
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,228
You're not strong yet.

362
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,897
No.

363
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:24,567
But soon.

364
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,320
And I want to ask you of one thing.

365
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,992
My blades, they were
destroyed by Brass Body.

366
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,704
I need a new suit of knives.

367
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:20,623
The X-Blade's new suit of knives.

368
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,793
The final weapon these
hands would ever forge.

369
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,630
And if he can avenge his
father with these blades,

370
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,300
then my debt to him will be paid.

371
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:35,054
And I can grab my girl and get
the fuck out of Jungle Village.

372
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,148
Come back to bed, Jackie.

373
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,860
Some pleasure before business?

374
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,654
You were business.

375
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,824
This is pleasure.

376
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:26,356
You've got good taste, Blacksmith.

377
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,193
I always thought that Lady Silk
was the finest of all the girls.

378
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,284
And you've been monopolizing her.

379
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,998
Tell me where Zen Yi is,

380
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:48,419
or I promise you, you will never see her again.

381
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:59,389
Oh, my.
This is no way to treat our guest.

382
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:02,392
Are we men, or are we beasts?

383
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,228
We are men!

384
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:11,568
So, my friend, I never got a chance to
thank you for your magnificent weapons.

385
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,653
They were invaluable.

386
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,830
So, it seems you've been working
quite hard these nights. I admire that.

387
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:28,001
But on what, may I ask?

388
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,088
Go to hell.

389
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:38,678
Listen, your skills can be used by us.

390
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,929
Hmm?

391
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:43,016
You can be a great asset.

392
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:49,105
If you give up Zen Yi and
pledge your allegiance to us,

393
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:52,275
your troubles will be over.

394
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:57,405
But, if you refuse, we'll
make sure you never work again.

395
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:04,120
You are no Gold Lion.

396
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,291
Well, that hurts.

397
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:15,048
I will ask you one last time.

398
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:21,262
Blackie, where is Zen Yi?

399
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,565
You shouldn't have done that.

400
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,207
Ooh.

401
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,054
What do you want to do with his body?

402
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,849
Leave him to the rats.

403
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,859
You're tough as old boots, Blacksmith.

404
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,320
Englishman.

405
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,697
Who are you?

406
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:46,616
You can call me Jack.

407
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,410
I'm the one who saved you from the reaper.

408
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,791
Not my arms.

409
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,752
No. They're rat food, I'm afraid.

410
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:00,171
We're going to have
to cauterize your wounds.

411
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:05,718
It won't be pleasant.
It won't be pleasant at all.

412
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,308
Quite a sophisticated
operation you have here.

413
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,729
Drink.

414
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,816
I see you work with mercury.

415
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,657
Again.

416
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,453
One more.
A large one.

417
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,000
Open your mouth, bite on this.

418
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,440
Take this, take this.

419
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,495
Your wounds are healing surprisingly quickly.

420
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,998
How do you feel?

421
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:25,715
Am I assuming correctly

422
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,633
that you made this?

423
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,731
So, how does a man with your obvious skill

424
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,902
end up in a wretched corner
of the Earth like this?

425
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:02,585
I spent most of my life
in chains, serving others.

426
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,884
The master of the plantation my family
worked on was dying of consumption.

427
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:14,430
For 35 years, my mother
served him, nursed him,

428
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,183
slept with him.

429
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,566
And on his deathbed...

430
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:41,582
Okay, now, what's his name?

431
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:43,876
Thaddeus.

432
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,878
Thaddeus...

433
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,257
Henry.

434
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,969
Smith.

435
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,269
Boy, good luck.
You're gonna need it.

436
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,772
Momma...

437
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,993
Hyah!

438
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,460
Hey, boy, you got
those horseshoes ready?

439
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:30,006
Didn't you hear? I asked
if them shoes were ready.

440
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,933
Nigger, you can't read.

441
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:43,853
So you don't know what
this fucking paper means.

442
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,105
It means nothing.

443
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,697
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah! Hey, man!

444
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:57,074
You're free now, huh, nigger?

445
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,285
- Come and get it! Come and get it.
- Come on. Yeah.

446
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,578
Crawl, nigger, crawl.

447
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,204
Come on, kitty!

448
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,458
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Come on.

449
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,584
Stay down.

450
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,335
Whoa!

451
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,047
Fidgety nigger, ain't he?

452
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:12,798
Go on, finish him off.
Go on.

453
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:15,801
Nigger, you're gonna wish
you had never been born.

454
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,729
Jake!

455
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,151
The nigger killed a white man!
The nigger killed a white man.

456
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,284
What you doing, Jane?

457
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,829
Nothing, sir.
Yeah.

458
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:46,707
Nothing.

459
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,462
I don't think so.

460
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,592
Your boy's around here?

461
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,302
Long gone.

462
00:59:58,804 --> 00:59:59,845
Yeah.

463
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:03,182
We'll see.

464
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:16,946
Run. Run, son, run.

465
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:42,012
The boat I escaped on sunk.

466
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,268
Everyone was lost at sea.

467
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,064
But somehow...

468
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:12,407
To disconnect ourselves
from this troublesome world.

469
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,152
Another one.

470
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,880
I strayed from the path,
and I paid the price.

471
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,509
The pendulum of karma
swings both ways.

472
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:00,807
They made me a cripple.

473
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:05,771
But if you help me, I will
forge my greatest weapon ever.

474
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:41,598
As a young mind, we taught
you that, in the beginning,

475
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,433
there was the word.

476
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,771
Yet when man failed to hear the word,

477
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,816
we were forced to teach by action.

478
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:01,410
The chi in your body travels
through the 12 vessels

479
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:04,788
and builds up in your Dan Tian.

480
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:09,376
Your triple burners convert
all particles to energy.

481
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:14,214
By learning to regulate breath
and controlling your chi,

482
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:18,302
a man is capable of amazing feats.

483
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:35,694
If one can find the source
to one's own energy,

484
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,991
he can transmit that energy

485
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,705
to activate inanimate objects.

486
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:55,213
You and the object become as one.

487
01:08:56,591 --> 01:09:02,387
It becomes a slave to your will, your mind.

488
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,681
Your chi.

489
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,650
What are you really here for?

490
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,446
Dear boy, gold.

491
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:26,912
So, how is your chi now?

492
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:58,568
Miss Silk, I'd like to thank you
and the blacksmith for your kindness.

493
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,947
The blacksmith, how is he?

494
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,992
The rumor is that he's dead.

495
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,198
Zen Yi.

496
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:47,993
My friend, you look pretty good.

497
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,036
For a dead man.

498
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,413
Thanks to him.

499
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,707
Care to join us for dinner?

500
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,418
I hope you don't mind your
noodles a touch on the spicy side.

501
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,963
This is an East Indian recipe.
Very hot.

502
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,215
And here's the secret.

503
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:06,511
Just a touch of butter.

504
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:07,762
Just a touch.

505
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:17,147
A spoon, dear boy.
Baby steps.

506
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:23,570
Now, might I suggest, given
the nature of our common enemy,

507
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,697
and the numbers we're about to encounter,

508
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,783
that we come up with a plan?

509
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:32,537
In fact, our Jungle wasn't always an outpost.

510
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,748
Rumor has it, the Fourth Emperor

511
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:36,917
built a magnificent tomb for his queen

512
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,960
directly beneath our village.

513
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,504
Oh, that's fascinating.

514
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,467
Here. To good fortune.

515
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,052
Good fortune.

516
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:50,889
Now, when the captain of the Jackals
arrives with his many armed troops,

517
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,975
where do you suppose he's going to attack?

518
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:58,647
Well, presumably the Lions' base.

519
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:02,567
Exactly, and they'll come not
only for gold, but also for lives.

520
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:07,364
We see the Madam is well informed.

521
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,575
My sheets know every secret in this town.

522
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:14,371
Gentlemen, we've had dinner.

523
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,250
Now, dessert.

524
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,468
Oh.

525
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,601
Shall we?

526
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,797
The Fourth Emperor, a man of imagination.

527
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,800
And I thought lies were your stock-in-trade.

528
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:12,095
Not stock.
Just trade.

529
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,014
What do you have in mind?

530
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:18,435
You store your gold here,
less the 3 % that goes to me,

531
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:22,981
along with the right to control
my women, my way, as I always have.

532
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,734
One way in, one way out?

533
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,652
Of course.

534
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,988
Three percent is quite steep.

535
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,656
Four percent.

536
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:32,824
My friend,

537
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:38,288
better 3 % to the madam
than 100 % to the Jackals.

538
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,834
All right, we have a deal.

539
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:54,387
Now, we need a lot of action from
you coming from the South Gate.

540
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:55,764
Try and make some noise.

541
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,932
We want the others to
think there's an attack.

542
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:59,476
No problem.

543
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,355
I presume you're coming in from the
chopstick gate in the north here.

544
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,734
And I'll keep the southern gate
locked up until you get there.

545
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,695
About how much time do we have
before the Jackals arrive?

546
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:12,656
Dawn.

547
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,534
If we don't get this done before then,

548
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,245
it'll be the end of the village.

549
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:21,706
They're moving the gold to the Blossom's.

550
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,129
I know a secret way.

551
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,298
Of course you do, little mouse.

552
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:34,552
Can you show us that secret way?

553
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,347
Change of plans.

554
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,981
Be careful, men.
Sorry.

555
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,443
Not with the gold, but with your jewels.

556
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,529
This place is rigged with many traps

557
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,989
that will make women of you
if you don't respect them.

558
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:56,074
Yes. Yes.

559
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:06,084
Rigged with traps?

560
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,878
Yes.

561
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,171
Oh.

562
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:13,341
You must tell.

563
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,522
Beautiful.

564
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,609
You may leave us now, Madam.

565
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,487
And thank you.

566
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:38,032
Goodbye, Madam.

567
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:43,872
She's quite lovely,

568
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,958
but partnership with this
woman is going to be an issue.

569
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,754
Don't worry.

570
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:54,215
In the morning, we will
kill all of these whores.

571
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:57,051
Oh, I can't wait.

572
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:01,222
So generous of your friend, the governor,

573
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,641
to bestow this great gift upon us.

574
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:10,732
You must never underestimate the
power of your enemy, Silver Lion.

575
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:15,236
You have a notable habit of celebrating early.

576
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,073
Have your men begun trapping the
Lion base with the explosives?

577
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:22,327
Oh, yes.
They should be nearly done by now.

578
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,789
When the mighty Jackals
show up there in the morning,

579
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,832
boom, boom, and bye-bye.

580
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,604
Stop it!

581
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,321
Lovelies.

582
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,948
Do not think for a moment

583
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,326
that I enjoy seeing you
forced into any position.

584
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,536
I have been exactly where you are.

585
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:32,749
I do not make these demands of you lightly.
Remember, there is a purpose.

586
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:39,297
The power has always lain with men.

587
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:44,802
Yet, it is essential to understand
that power is not theirs by birth.

588
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:52,560
The nature of power is that it belongs
to no one until it is taken, seized.

589
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:56,397
Seized through sex, violence.

590
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,400
Gold.

591
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:06,574
Men may have always held the power,

592
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:12,163
but power is a fickle mistress.

593
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:17,460
And here in Jungle Village,
the winds of change

594
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,171
are nearly upon us.

595
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:28,596
Hear me clearly, my darlings,

596
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:32,266
when I say that our days of shame
and disgrace are nearly over.

597
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:35,186
Now, back to work.

598
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:39,774
Dry off, prepare yourselves.

599
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:42,485
And we'll see who's left standing,

600
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:46,030
and who is on their knees.

601
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,453
Come, ladies, you heard Madam.

602
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,127
Warriors.

603
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:03,297
Brave Lions, kings of the jungle!

604
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:08,553
Drink up!
Partake of the women.

605
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:14,058
Tonight, my friends, the Pink Blossom is yours.

606
01:21:49,363 --> 01:21:51,322
Oh, baby.

607
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:06,838
Do you like it?

608
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,589
Yeah.

609
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:48,588
Aah!

610
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:38,554
Stupid bitch.

611
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,440
No!

612
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,460
Black widow.

613
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,589
Thaddeus.

614
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:15,276
This way! This way!

615
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:20,364
Mmm...

616
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:32,960
You thief, get out of here!

617
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:10,331
What was that?

618
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,917
I always take a gun to a knife fight.

619
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:45,606
Zen Yi.

620
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:47,483
Silver Lion.

621
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:51,070
Come and get me.

622
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:53,864
Jack Knife.
I thought you were dead.

623
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:57,284
Reports of my demise were
greatly exaggerated, Dagger.

624
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:59,870
Well, then.
There's business to be done here.

625
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:04,666
Not this time, old chap.
You see, I'm on the other side.

626
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,293
Government emissary?

627
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:07,961
The emperor himself, no less.

628
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:30,150
Zen Yi.

629
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:00,908
Tiger style.

630
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,578
I thought your clan was extinct.

631
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,413
My clan is extinct.

632
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:10,918
I killed them.

633
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,711
I'm afraid you've come
up a little short, my friend.

634
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:20,589
Jack.

635
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,221
Unfortunately, Dagger, the
gears of life move inexorably

636
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:29,556
in only one direction.

637
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:33,101
I'm glad to see you've adopted
the philosophies of my people.

638
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:34,436
Now get me out of here!

639
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:36,355
Dagger, Dagger, Dagger.

640
01:35:36,939 --> 01:35:39,691
You should have finished what you started.

641
01:35:40,485 --> 01:35:43,612
That is the difference between you and me!

642
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:47,532
I see my jobs through to the end.

643
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:51,828
The only difference between
you and me is the poison we use.

644
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,538
Opium?

645
01:35:53,623 --> 01:35:54,956
It's not a poison.

646
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:56,667
And it's not a curse.

647
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:00,962
It is a benefit and a solace
to the hardworking Chinese.

648
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:04,299
And the occasional Englishman.

649
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,303
I'll see you in hell.

650
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:10,639
I suppose you will.

651
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,100
Save me a spot by the fire.

652
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:24,319
I'm to your right.
I'm to your left.

653
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:33,662
What took you so long?

654
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,707
Got caught up looking at
yourself in the mirror?

655
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:41,253
Now you die, little brother.

656
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,849
Gold Lion raised you as a son.

657
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:59,146
Why would you betray us?

658
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,856
This was my time.

659
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,025
My time!

660
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:09,364
And this is my gold.

661
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,368
Well, here's your gold.

662
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:46,026
I'm gonna drill you like I
drilled your little whore.

663
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:10,735
By order of the emperor,

664
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:13,488
you have five seconds to bring out the gold,

665
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:15,532
or we will kill you all.

666
01:39:15,658 --> 01:39:16,658
Five.

667
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:19,995
Four.

668
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:22,414
Three.

669
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:25,333
Two.

670
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:27,752
One.

671
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:30,422
Gentlemen!

672
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:34,676
Colonel Jack C. Wales, emissary of the emperor.

673
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:40,265
Everything here is under control.

674
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:54,821
Good.

675
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:10,295
My friend, I've lost a father,

676
01:40:12,048 --> 01:40:13,381
but I gained a brother.

677
01:40:32,276 --> 01:40:33,276
Thaddeus.

678
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:34,569
Jack.

679
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:36,488
Thanks.

680
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:38,156
No, thank you.

681
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:41,368
I haven't had this much fun since
we protected the crown in Macau.

682
01:40:53,089 --> 01:40:54,839
The Chinese say,

683
01:40:54,924 --> 01:40:57,509
"Where there is iron, there is rust."

684
01:40:57,593 --> 01:40:59,844
Well, not anymore.

685
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:01,805
Jungle Village was clean.

686
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:05,350
And I'm gonna make sure
that it stays that way.

687
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:50,635
Chi Chi.

688
01:45:53,389 --> 01:45:56,432
Chi Chi! Chi Chi!

689
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:17,495
Chi Chi.

690
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:43,146
My brother,

691
01:46:47,276 --> 01:46:49,318
I'm in need of your hands again.
