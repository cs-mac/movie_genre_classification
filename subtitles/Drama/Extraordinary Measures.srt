Hi there.
Hi.

3
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,300
So glad to see you.

4
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,807
Kathy, could you take that?

5
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,046
Thank you.

6
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,905
It's my job to market this drug for

7
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,108
Bristol-Myers, and I'm telling you,

8
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:55,017
kids won't go for it unless
it tastes like bubble gum.

9
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,782
Mr. Crowley, you're late.

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,221
All right.
Thank you. Bye.

"'They must be rock haters,

14
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,441
John! Give it back to me!

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,648
She's mine now!

16
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,948
Give me a minute, okay?

17
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,419
Give it back to me, John!

18
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,457
You save our spot. Got it?

19
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,754
You better give me
back my Fiona!

20
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,060
Help, Mom!

21
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,562
Help me! She's trying to kill me!

22
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,598
I'm gonna get you!

23
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,702
You can't escape!

24
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,430
No! Mom, help me!

25
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,831
Just give it back to me.

26
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,575
Mom! She's trying to kill me!

Megan Kathryn Crowley.

28
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,946
If you kill your brother,
you cannot have your party.

29
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,075
Why not? He stole Fiona.

30
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,917
I didn't steal her, I kidnapped her.
I'm holding her for ransom.

31
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,820
Release the victim.

32
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,327
Time to get ready for your party.

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,128
We've got to get
moving on the product launch.

34

<i>I'm just waiting on legal, John.</i>

35
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,333
Damn it!

36
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,331
I just missed my train.
I'm gonna have to call you...

37
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,632
I agree.
How soon do you need it?

38
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,173
As soon as possible.
I'm presenting to my boss next week.

39
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,572
John, we're loading up
the van right now. Come on!

40
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,148
Okay, we ready to roll, Kate?

41
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,376
My name is Jane.

42
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,849
Kate was yesterday, Mom.

43
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,283
I am so sorry.

44
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,287
The way the agency
shuffles day nurses on us,

45
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,187
you'd think they'd, you know,
give you a number instead of a name.

46
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,751
Okay, John.

47
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,324
John, come on,
get your butt in the car.

48
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,660
John.

49
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,658
Are you bringing your RipStik?
Yes.

50
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,702
Do you have to?
Yes.

51
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,637
...a pain, that's why.
Wait, I gotta catch a cab.

52
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,109
Hi. Come here.
Hey, hey. Hello?

53
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,649
Daddy's meeting
us there, right?

54
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,116
Absolutely.

55
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,784
I am sure he has
everything under control.

56
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,384
Taxi!

57
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,196
You need a hand?

58
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,792
Great. I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. I'm kind of in a hurry.

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,411
Go.

60
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,213
Come on, come on, come on...

61
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,753
Yes!

62
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,494
Yes!

63
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,061
He totally promised
he'd be here by now.

64
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,435
He's on his way, baby.
He's on his way.

65
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,476

Hi, guys.</i>

68
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,454
Get in there and give her a kiss.
I know.

69
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,220
I don't wanna hear it...
Go, go, go.

70
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,522
Happy birthday.
I made it.

71
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,629
Yay!

72
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,392
Make a wish, Megan.

73
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,731
Who wants cake?

74
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,307
I do!

75
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,275
Line up single file,
or no cake for you.

76
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,538
All right, how many do we have?

77
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,909
I'm first!
Me first!

78
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,515
No, I'm the big guy.

79
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,117
Back to the end of the line.

80
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,729
So, where is Fiona going, anyway?

81
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,561
Lollipop Land?

82
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,169
I'm 8, Daddy.
I'm not a baby anymore.

83
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,636
She's driving to Antarctica
to see the penguins.

84
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,938
Really?

85
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,680
That's pretty far away.

86
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,176
Why doesn't she just go
to the Portland Zoo?

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,753
They have a lot of
penguins there, too.

88
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,913
Haven't you ever
heard of adventure?

89
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,513
Yeah.

90
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,150
It's gonna take her years.

91
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,197
Won't she need a suitcase?

92
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,028
It's an adventure. You don't
need a suitcase on an adventure.

93
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,432
Well, I don't know about you,
but if I was going on an adventure,

94
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,765
I would take a suitcase.

95
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,600
That's 'cause you're a businessman.

96
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,834
That's right. I am.

97
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,675
And you're 8 years old.
And happy birthday. And I love you.

98
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,975
Love you, too, Daddy.

99
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,214
Good night.
See you in the morning.

100
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,517
Good night.

101
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,446
Nighty-night.

102
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,149
Sweet dreams.

103
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,226
Good night, Dad.

104
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,898
Good night, Daddy.
Night, buddy.

Hello, Dr. Stonehill?

112
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,770
Are you there? Hello?

113
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,138
Yeah.

114
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,871
This is John Crowley.

115
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,106
I don't know if you've gotten
any of my messages.

116
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,273
Who?
John...

117
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,717
Jesus.

118
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,046
I'm interested in
speaking with you.

119
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,518
I understand from
many researchers...

120
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,054
having a conversation
with you if that's convenient.

121
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,127
Is this a good time to talk?

122
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,558
Dr. Stonehill? Hello?

123
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,070
Asshole.

124
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,705
"Asshole?"

125
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,613
The night nurse just left.

126
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,048
What time is it?

127
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,350
I missed you.

128
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,088
This is pathetic.
I'm still dressed.

129
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,059
I could help you with that.

130
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,114
My... Kate!
Hi! You're early.

131
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,579
You're early.
6:00.

132
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,622
Have you met...
I'm John Crowley.

133
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,320
John is my husband.

134
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,320
Glad to hear it.

135
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,279
Yeah, let's up her
breathing treatments today.

136
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,851
What's going on?

137
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,819
Just a cold.
She's awfully congested.

138
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,554
Call the doc just to
be on the safe side?

139
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,557
Yeah, I left word.

140
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,429
Sweetie? I'm gonna
go to work, okay?

141
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,521
Feel better.

142
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,866
Bye-bye.

143
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,165
We're already doing great
marketing the drug to physicians.

144
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,968
It's our direct marketing to patients
we need to beef up.

145
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,976
Mr. Crowley, I'm really sorry.

146
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,876
Aileen's on the line,
she really needs to speak to you.

147
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,847
Okay, thank you.
I'm just gonna... Hey.

148
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:28,181
We're at the hospital.
The doc wants Megan under observation.

149
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,476
Is she all right?

150
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,021
Just keep
your cell with you.

151
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,215
Okay. Can I do something?

152
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,553
I'll call you when I know more.

153
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,457
I should really get back to Megan,
so I'll call you

154
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,257
as soon as I
know anything, okay?

155
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,955
Bye. Love you.

156
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,799
Excuse me, please.
Sir?

157
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,343
My daughter, Megan Crowley,

158
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,639
was brought in for observation.

159
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,045
Yeah. Actually,
they're moving her to the ICU.

160
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,014
Where?
That way.

161
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,113
Aileen.

162
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,188
John.

163
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,981
Has she told you
about the trip

164
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,457
that Fiona's taking with her
remote-controlled car?

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,188
Yeah, yes, she did.
You're right. That's right, sweetie.

166
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,856
You're gonna see all the penguins,
aren't you?

167
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,195
She might send some postcards
or something like that.

168
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,166
Lots of good stuff to see along the way...
It's okay.

169
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,000
like icebergs and
maybe a polar bear.

170
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,772
How about some seals?

171
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,354
As you know, Pompe patients
suffer muscle deterioration

172
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,057
in every part of the body,

173
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,193
so this sort of respiratory
complication, well,

174
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,864
that's just an inevitable
fact of the disease.

175
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,477
Mr. Crowley, Mrs. Crowley,

176
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,581
Megan is not
responding well.

177
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,289
Okay? Now, we've done everything
we can, but she's just...

178
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,824
There's nothing more
we can do. I'm sorry.

179
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,256
As you know, she was already
well past the life expectancy,

180
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,590
for, you know, Pompe kids.

181
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:26,000
After all, it's not
just her lungs, okay?

182
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:30,064
Her heart, her liver,
these organs have been compromised

183
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,009
and would've
become fatally enlarged.

184
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,638
Now, I wish that we had a drug
to treat Pompe,

185
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,842
but we simply don't.

186
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,812
I'm so very sorry.

187
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,313
Look, maybe...

188
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,654
Maybe you can find
some small comfort

189
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,820
in knowing that Megan's
suffering will be over.

190
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,323
Maybe you can see
this as a blessing.

191
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,533
Megan?
Help!

192
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,070
Help! Help!
Megan?

193
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,900
Help! Help!

194
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,099
Baby girl, can you hear me?

195
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,677
Please, someone come help!
321!

196
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,837
Megan Crowley, room 321, please!
Code Blue!

197
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,040
Baby girl, Mama's here, all right?
Let's go! Page Dr. Heder.

198
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,343
Asystole!
Yeah, right through here.

199
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,112
Can you hear my voice?
Can you hear Mama?

200
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,311
Starting compressions.

201
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,546
I'll switch her out.

202
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,782
Over here, please quickly.
Hang in there, Megan.

203
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,483
Hang in there, baby, okay?
I need to bag her.

204
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,059
Aileen?
Some room right there.

205
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,354
Let us in, all right?

206
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,123
Please, Mrs. Crowley, let...
Stop it!

207
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,288
Let us help her!

208
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,092
Please... Megan!
Aileen.

209
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,599
Epinephrine, 0.1 mils per kig.
Got it.

210
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,761
Still no pulse. No reading.

211
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,930
Forget the weight, come on,
get it in there! Aileen, Aileen.

212
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,233
0.1 epi.
It's all right.

213
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,366
Come on, Megs.
Come on. Come on. IV push.

214
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,445
Okay, just give the epi
a couple seconds.

215
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,603
Still non-responsive.

216
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,375
All right, charge the defib.
Charging.

217
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,940
Your daughter is some fighter.

218
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,336
She's gonna be okay.

219
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,435
My God.

220
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,981
Now, look, she's still a very
sick girl, obviously,

221
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,108
but her vital signs have improved

222
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,619
and I'm cautiously optimistic.

223
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,651
So, I guess you could say
we dodged that blessing?

224
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,069
Mrs. Crowley,
these came for Megan.

225
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,139
Thanks so much. Thank you.

226
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,937
Hey, John?

227
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,173
Any time you're ready, man.

228
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,073
You gonna tell us
about the product launch?

229
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,249
John, you okay?

230
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,516
I have to go.

231
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,651
John.

232
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,526
Where you going?
Nebraska.

233
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,028
Excuse me, please.
There's a gentleman here to see you.

234
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,634
Best make yourself
comfortable, hon.

235
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,324
Dear.

236
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,901
Sir, sir. That's Dr. Stonehill.
He just left, I'm sorry.

237
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,662
Thank you.
Yeah.

238
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,894
Dr. Stonehill!

239
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,973
Hey, Dr. Stonehill!

240
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,704
Dr. Stonehill?

241
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,473
Yeah?

242
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,674
I'm John Crowley.

243
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,850
Okay.
Didn't you get any of my messages?

244
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,880
What messages?

245
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,254
I left you 3 or 4 messages
in the last month,

246
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,089
and you even hung up
on me the night before last.

247
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,892
What the hell are you talking about?
I never hung up on you.

248
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,759
Dr. Stonehill,
2 of my kids have Pompe.

249
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,630
Jesus.

250
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,204
Well, I'm sorry.

251
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,706
A terrible disease,

252
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,337
but, hell, you shouldn't have
come all this way

253
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,540
without talking to me.

254
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,709
I do research, son.
I don't see patients.

255
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,980
Well, it's your research
that I'm interested in.

256
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,887
I've read all the journal articles
on Pompe disease,

257
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,393
and all the researchers
out there say that

258
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,394
your work holds
the most promise.

259
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,624
Get to the point, son.
What do you want from me?

260
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,564
We almost lost my
daughter last week.

261
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,903
I need to hear
about your research.

262
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,575
Your kids have a genetic disease.

263
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,075
They're missing an enzyme

264
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,917
which metabolizes a certain kind
of sugar, glycogen.

265
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,992
It's defective in Pompe patients.

266
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,954
So, this sugar builds up
in the muscle cells,

267
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:08,431
especially in the heart,
the skeletal muscles, the diaphragm,

268
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,524
which is why they have
a hard time breathing.

269
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,897
Yeah, I know.
I know a lot about that.

270
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,131
Everybody's making
an enzyme,

271
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,167
but you can infuse kids all day long
with their enzyme,

272
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,607
and it's not
gonna do any good

273
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,009
'cause it's not gonna
get into their cells.

274
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,082
Understand what I'm saying?

275
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,877
Yeah, so that means that
if you put the sugar...

276
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,315
Don't interrupt.
Sorry.

277
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,877
I'm making a different version
of this enzyme.

278
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:35,551
My enzyme has a biological marker,
mannose 6-phosphate.

279
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,323
I'm the only one that's cloned the gene
for phosphotransferase.

280
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,229
I'm the only one who's cloned the gene
for uncovering enzyme,

281
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,497
so I can get more mannose 6-phosphate
onto the lysosomal protein,

282
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:51,633
and I can deliver a more effective
amount of enzyme

283
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,703
into the cells.

284
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,676
That's why people
are citing my work.

285
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,749
That's why you read my name
in the literature.

286
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,148
I can get more
enzyme into the cells.

287
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:06,250
What's the matter, Sal?
Not up on your glycobiology?

288
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,989
I thought Doc was
just your nickname.

289
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,257
No, that man's a genius. He's on
the verge of a scientific breakthrough.

290
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:14,865
Who knew?

291
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,326
I'm not on the
verge of anything, kid.

292
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,302
This is a theory,
not a therapy.

293
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,740
I'm just an academic.

294
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,808
You got any idea how
shitty my funding is?

295
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,502
No.

296
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,679
University of Nebraska
pays their football coach

297
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:32,750
more money in a year
than my entire science budget.

298
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,512
Nobody's paying
attention to this work.

299
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,781
Half my grants
don't get approved.

300
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,257
I don't have the money to make
my theory into a useable medicine.

301
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,295
How old are your kids?

302
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,890
6 and 8.

303
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:58,809
Look, do yourself a favor.
Go home and spend time with your kids.

304
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,910
Enjoy 'em while they're still here.

305
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,113
How much?

306
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,213
How much what?

307
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,118
How much money would it take
to prove your theory,

308
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,720
to create your version
of the medicine?

309
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,966
I'd need half a million bucks
just to fund the lab work.

310
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,365
That's why you need me.

311
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,098
I need you? Why?

312
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:32,973
Because I'm the founder of the
Pompe Foundation for Children.

313
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,808
I've been working on this disease
for 10 years.

314
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,577
I have never
heard of you guys.

315
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,619
That's because
we're relatively new.

316
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,149
We're just in
the gearing-up phase.

317
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,150
How soon do you
need a grant?

318
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,890
Now would be good.

319
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:54,329
Well, not all the money's in place,
but it will be, and soon.

320
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,433
This is a very
exciting time.

321
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,282
Thanks.
Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

322
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,392
Hey.

323
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,668
You okay?

324
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,308
Did you get my messages?

325
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,911
Your messages?

326
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,412
You suddenly walk
out of the meeting

327
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,143
and fly to Nebraska
without talking to me about it,

328
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,379
and you think
messages make it okay?

329
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,580
I'm sorry.
My God, John.

330
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,681
I wanna find a miracle
as much as you do, okay?

331
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,057
But how could you put
your job in jeopardy?

332
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,662
Aileen.
How exactly

333
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,096
do we pay $40,000 a month in healthcare
if you lose your insurance?

334
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,701
Honey, come on.
Look, I'm not gonna lose my job.

335
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,860
Really?

336
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,565
Pete called here twice last night
to ask if you were okay.

337
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,504
You know, mentally.

338
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:21,411
I'll just... I'll call, and I'll
smooth that one over.

339
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,277
Yeah, no shit.

340
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,726
I'm sorry.

341
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,897
Something in me
just kind of snapped.

342
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:42,270
That night at the hospital, when we
thought that we were losing her,

343
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,779
I prayed that if it was her time,

344
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,749
she'd go quickly,
without so much suffering.

345
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,727
But morning came,
and she pulled through.

346
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,457
Her eyes,

347
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,296
so determined, so defiant.

348
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,404
The fight in her.

349
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,252
Was he worth it?
This Stonehill guy?

350
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,086
He's really eccentric,
but his science

351
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,988
is way ahead of
everybody else's.

352
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,721
He's definitely the one to put
our money on.

353
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,263
If we had any.

354
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,731
I promised him
that we'd raise some,

355
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,893
because he's got this conference
up here next month,

356
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,335
and I said I'd have
a check ready for him.

357
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,632
How much?
500.

358
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,799
That's all?
Thousand.

359
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,603
Is it $500 or $1,000?

360
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,143
$500,000.

361
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,774
By next month.

362
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,823
Sweetheart, are you totally insane?

363
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,318
Apparently.

364
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:13,325
We're holding our first fundraiser
on the 23rd at the school,

365
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,797
and we would love if
you and Frank could join us.

366
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,889
Ready for your spelling test?

367
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,765
I'm gonna nail it.
Okay. Good luck.

368
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,031
My name's John Crowley.
I'm calling from Oregon,

369
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:25,632
and I got your name from the
Atlanta-area Pompe parents' group.

370
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,733
Yeah.

371
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,039
And I was so sorry
not to see you at the reunion

372
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,911
because you were one of my most
favorite people in high school.

373
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,677
Anyway, John and I
are starting this foundation.

374
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,518
Hey, Dad? Dad.
No, you know what I mean.

375
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,114
Just make it right.
Dad?

376
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,786
Can't you see
I'm on the phone?

377
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,159
Okay, well, tell me he told you.
Dad!

378
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,390
No, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

379
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,830
I can't talk. All right, bye.

380
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,833
Yeah, what is it?
I sold my RipStik.

381
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:51,924
Okay.

382
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:56,100
Is it enough to give to Megan
and Patrick's foundation?

383
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,041
Yeah, it's more than enough.

384
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,214
Are you John?
Yes.

385
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,908
Marcus Temple.
We spoke on the phone.

386
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,781
Right. Absolutely.
Good to see you.

387
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,378
All the way in from Atlanta.
Yes.

388
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,420
Well, this is for your foundation,

389
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,619
from my relatives,
friends and church group.

390
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,423
My goodness.

391
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,628
Thank you very much.

392
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,102
Thanks.

393
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,825
Hi, Dr. Stonehill.
I'm Megan.

394
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,396
Hi, Megan.
I'm Dr. Stonehill.

395
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,724
Yeah, that's why I said,
"Hi, Dr. Stonehill."

396
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,129
Are you coming in or not?

397
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,098
Yeah, thanks.

398
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,732
Where's Mom and Dad?

399
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,104
They'll be down in a minute.

400
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,771
Patrick's vent alarm is going off,
so they need to fix it.

401
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,678
His alarm goes off
even more than mine.

402
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:23,324
So, what's your deal?
You married?

403
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,986
Do you have a wife?

404
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:28,463
Ex-wives. 2 of 'em.

405
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,193
Yeah? How come?

406
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,030
'Cause I'm so easy
to get along with.

407
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,402
Any other questions?

408
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,133
No. Your turn to ask one.

409
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,467
You're probably wondering
what grade I'm in.

410
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,875
What grade are you in?

411
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,072
I'm in 3rd.

412
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,878
My hobbies are video games and penguins.
How about you?

413
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,119
I already graduated.

414
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,881
No, I mean hobbies.

415
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,017
Mostly I just work.

416
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,459
Little bass fishing
every once in a while, but...

417
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,197
What's your favorite subject?

418
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,667
I'm good at reading, but I like P.E. best,
especially the sprint races.

419
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,999
Sprint races?

420
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,403
Wanna see?

421
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,565
Sure.

422
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,179
Come on.

423
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:20,977
Is he here yet?

424
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,143
I don't know.

425
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,063
I'm gonna win!

426
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,665
Come on, slowpoke.

427
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,699
Yeah, I won!

428
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,738
I won.

429
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,841
Yeah.

430
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,707
Told you I'm gonna beat you.

431
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,009
Hi.

432
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,877
Dr. Stonehill has 2 ex-wives.

433
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,250
I see that Megan's introduced herself.
Yeah.

434
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,379
How are you, Dr. Stonehill?
I'm okay, thank you.

435
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,424
This is Aileen, my wife.
So nice to meet you.

436
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,493
And John Jr.

437
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,686
Hello.

438
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,057
Here's Patrick.
Hi.

439
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,927
Hey, Patrick.
I think we should probably go inside.

440
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,358
Yeah, come on inside.

441
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,368
Megan, we'll see you inside.
Come on.

442
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,106
Night, Patrick.
Good night.

443
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,939
Night, SpongeBob.

444
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,570
You gotta say good
night to Dr. Stonehill.

445
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,273
Kiss SpongeBob.

446
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,257
Good night.
Good night, son.

447
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,555
Good night, Patrick.

448
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,825
I'm not gonna say it again.
It is bedtime now.

449
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,960
It's for him.

450
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,630
Me?

451
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,298
For good luck.
For bass fishing.

452
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,331
Thank you.

453
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,674
You like it?

454
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,905
Well, sure.

455
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,542
A happy-go-lucky little fellow,
lots of personality?

456
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,584
He's a plastic toy.

457
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,516
I know.

458
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,089
Here's the father-daughter dance.

459
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,987
You haven't lived until you've seen

460
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,582
Megan do the Wheelchair Watusi.

461
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,161
Here you go.

462
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,526
Go ahead and eat
the cobbler while it's hot.

463
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,223
Smells great, honey.

464
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,858
This was hilarious.

465
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,233
Bob, we went to this dude ranch.

466
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,672
All right if I call you Bob?

467
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,365
You got a check for
a half-million dollars,

468
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,339
hell, you can
call me Peggy Sue.

469
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,371
I'll just...

470
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,317
Well, Bob.

471
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:48,592
This is the first installment against
the promised half a million.

472
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,673
Tell you the truth,
that's more than I expected.

473
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,874
Dr. Stonehill, we promise that...

474
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,814
Yeah, I know.
If... In enough time, then...

475
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,887
I know. I know.

476
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,822
You can learn a lot about a person
on the Internet these days.

477
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,384
Learn about a working-class kid
from New Jersey,

478
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,498
worked his way through
Harvard Business School,

479
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,067
clawing his way up the ladder
at Bristol-Myers.

480
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,669
But what Google
can't tell you

481
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,204
is that this scared, desperate,
bullshitting son of a bitch...

482
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,204
Wait just a minute...
Don't interrupt.

483
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,641
Will do and say whatever it takes
to get results.

484
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,043
Which is why you
and me are going

485
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,138
into business
together, Jersey.

486
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,375
Excuse me?

487
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,747
I'm tired of begging breadcrumbs
from the university

488
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,411
and giving them
the patents to my ideas.

489
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,353
They don't value
my work. You do,

490
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,754
which is why I'm
setting up my own shop.

491
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,226
Figure any dude
in a business suit

492
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,490
can help me raise venture capital
and run the company,

493
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,362
but who's gonna be
half as motivated as

494
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,662
a dad who's trying
to save his own kids?

495
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,067
So, this is...

496
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,673
So this is the shittiest offer
you're ever gonna get.

497
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,734
I can promise you less money,
longer hours, lousy working conditions,

498
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,815
plus, if we raise the money, you're
gonna have to relocate to Nebraska.

499
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,018
And with the right business plan,

500
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:22,058
I can also promise you a working
enzyme for Pompe disease.

501
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,158
I can't cure your kids,
you know that.

502
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,127
They're always
gonna be in wheelchairs,

503
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,728
but I think I can save their lives.

504
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,571
Outstanding cobbler.

505
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,975
Okay, okay.
So, we agree we can't uproot the kids.

506
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,944
What if Stonehill fails?

507
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,357
Or what if he succeeds too late
to help Megs and Patrick?

508
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,551
Then what?

509
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,220
I know.

510
00:34:58,963 --> 00:34:59,987
If we're gonna
lose them young,

511
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,362
you want to spend every
minute you can with them.

512
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:14,505
John, that day that
you flew to Nebraska,

513
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:18,172
when you suddenly
just ditched work and...

514
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:24,143
My God, I thought you'd lost it.
You scared me.

515
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,517
But once we
rolled our sleeves up,

516
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,890
and we started fundraising and
meeting other Pompe families,

517
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,667
it made me feel like...

518
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,331
I mean, do we
just accept our fate

519
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:43,032
and do what we're told by
all the well-meaning doctors

520
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,176
and wait for the worst to happen,
or do we fight it?

521
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:54,681
I think you're making a mistake.
I really do.

522
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:59,382
Even if you were credible as a CEO,
which you are not,

523
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,157
the odds against
you are crushing.

524
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,888
9 out of 10
biotechs crash and burn.

525
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:09,995
So where does that leave your kids
when their dad is flat broke

526
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:14,162
with no job and no
health insurance?

527
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,530
Now, if you
stay at Bristol,

528
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,937
the guys upstairs
are ready to put you in

529
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,874
the VP slot at the end of
the 3rd quarter

530
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,172
with a 40% salary bump.

531
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,174
John.

532
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,814
Your family's gonna need that money,
aren't they?

533
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,650
Pete, you're right.
This is crazy.

534
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,924
I'm chasing the wind.

535
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,162
But I can't just

536
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,361
sit around and wait
for my kids to die.

537
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,828
I can't do it.

538
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,362
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

539
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,440
Come on in. It's open.

540
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,878
Hey, there, Bob.
Hey, John.

541
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,780
How are you?
You have trouble finding me?

542
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:34,942
No problem.

543
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,116
Sit down.
Thanks.

544
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,829
Ex-wife. She loved cats.

545
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,297
Well, say, what do we...

546
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,903
What are we gonna do?
How about we work up a strategy

547
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,808
for the meeting at
Renzler next week?

548
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,949
We don't need to show
those guys anything.

549
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,784
The meeting's a formality.

550
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,446
George Renzler and I have known
each other since med school.

551
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:16,356
He's been telling me for years that
he'd give me the seed money

552
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,930
if I ever decide to make the big move
and set up my own shop.

553
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,293
Well, that's good.
That's good,

554
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,593
but, still, all the same, you know,

555
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,667
if we're gonna go in to pitch 'em,

556
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,962
we should have something tangible.

557
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,703
Those guys understand me.
They're real scientists.

558
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,775
They're not like a lot of these
big biotech moneymen.

559
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,472
Okay. All right, tell you what,

560
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,740
how about if we just talk it through,

561
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,612
and then that way we can just sketch up
something rough on paper?

562
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:44,017
You give it to me,
I'll make up a business plan.

563
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,825
We need to rough out a real strategy.

564
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,194
These guys are venture capitalists.

565
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,027
That rough enough for you?

566
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,631
Bob? Look, Renzler's
crucial to us.

567
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,138
Without them onboard,
we got zero credibility

568
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,832
with any of our investors.
That's why you're here, Jersey!

569
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,502
Whip up some business bullshit
by tomorrow.

570
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,873
I'm going fishing.

571
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,140
This is... This is gibberish!

572
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,345
Then you better get busy.

573
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,850
See you.

574
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,666
As you know, the market potential

575
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,606
for an orphan drug is enormous.

576
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,337
If you were still in business school,
I'd give you an A

577
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:45,711
for all these lovely
charts and graphs and...

578
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,048
But school is out.

579
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,983
Most of us here are scientists.

580
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,112
We need to see the science.

581
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,389
Bob, make us believe.

582
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,925
Love to, George.

583
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:18,912
...the phosphotransferase and
the 2nd uncovering enzyme...

584
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,153
At this point, the challenge
is to scale up this process

585
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,953
to produce kilogram
quantities of HPGAA.

586
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,153
And the question is
whether or not it's cost-effective

587
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:36,733
to contract this work out or to build
our own manufacturing facility.

588
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,098
Either way, we're gonna
eventually need

589
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,967
an investment on
the order of $10 million.

590
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,769
It's a lot of information
in a short period of time.

591
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,537
Does anybody
have any questions?

592
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,613
This is astonishing.
Well, thank you, George.

593
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,011
This man is light years
ahead of the field.

594
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,708
Okay.

595
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,945
Well, why don't you have your
money guys get together with John

596
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,783
and work out the business...

597
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,856
Sounds great.

598
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,357
Of course, we'll need you to explain

599
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,952
some of the mundane stuff, Bob,
the nuts and bolts.

600
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,597
Nuts and bolts? What...
Yeah.

601
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,189
You're a brilliant theoretician,

602
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,961
but you've never actually
brought a new drug

603
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,969
to market
before, right?

604
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,838
No, I've never brought a drug to market.
I haven't.

605
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,965
I mean, for example,

606
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,806
how are you getting
the phosphotransferase?

607
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,604
I'm purifying it out of
a lactating bovine udder.

608
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,543
I see. And where are
you getting the udders?

609
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,223
From the stockyards.

610
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,915
Pretty straightforward stuff.

611
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,014
Not really.

612
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,117
You can't inject cow
protein into people.

613
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,821
I know that.

614
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,557
The bovine version
of the enzyme

615
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,599
is for lab work,
for proof of concept.

616
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,296
I'll make a copy of the human enzyme
for actual drug trials.

617
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,668
What about uncovering enzyme?
What about it?

618
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,502
How exactly do you plan
on making an exact replica?

619
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,908
I'm making it in T-293,
out of human kidney cells.

620
00:41:55,245 --> 00:41:56,774
Oh, my goodness. No.

621
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,141
"Oh, my goodness. No?"

622
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,876
No. The FDA will never allow that.

623
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,542
Hey, Bob, just...
Wait a second.

624
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,420
For Christ's sake, we will change

625
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,684
the cell line before clinical trials.

626
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,315
You've gotta have
that process locked down

627
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,757
long, long before
you think about...

628
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,089
Bob, why don't we just
take a coffee break...

629
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,458
Why are you
talking to me this way?

630
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,963
I don't want any goddamn coffee.

631
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,260
Bob, can you just tell us
how you're planning to make

632
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:21,064
the 3 enzymes under
FDA-approved GMP in...

633
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:24,470
I'm not here to cross every "t"
and dot every "i", George.

634
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,770
And I'm not here to
be poked and prodded

635
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,674
like a 1st-year med student.

636
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,110
This is ridiculous.

637
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,272
Bob.

638
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,178
This is bullshit.

639
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,481
Bob.

640
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,693
Bob, if you can't
answer a question,

641
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,734
you say you're
working out the details.

642
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:53,132
You don't storm out
on these guys

643
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,364
like some sort of
spoiled child, okay?

644
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,740
Now, we're gonna
go back in there.

645
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,898
No, I'm not going
back in there.

646
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,637
We're going back in there.
This is business, Bob. It's not personal.

647
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,804
That was personal.

648
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,988
Stonehill goes and completely
sabotages the meeting.

649
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,080
Thank you.

650
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,956
I mean, he completely blew my plan,
right out of the gate.

651
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,723
Okay, I get that
he's a loose cannon,

652
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,457
but do you still
believe in his science?

653
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:26,366
Honey, if I don't raise
$10 million in capital,

654
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,666
his science doesn't
matter. At all.

655
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:36,645
What's going on
with his arm?

656
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,716
Hey, buddy, you okay?

657
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,847
You all right?
I can't throw them anymore.

658
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,119
When did this happen?

659
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,454
I don't know.

660
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,153
You should help him, Daddy.

661
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,730
That's a good idea.

662
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,697
Okay, here we go. You ready?

663
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,392
1, 2...

664
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,928
Into the water.

665
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,865
That was a good shot.
We can do better than that.

666
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,910
Try again.
Let's make, like, a little pellet.

667
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,342
Here, ducky, ducky.

668
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,680
Let's do it again.

669
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,213
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

670
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,122
Give me another piece, John.

671
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,752
I can just throw them.

672
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:31,099
And you do all the laughing,
and I'll do all the throwing.

673
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:32,996
That's good, the ducky shared.

674
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,900
Did you see that?
Yeah.

675
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:43,539
John?

676
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:47,777
We're out of time.

677
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,478
I know.

678
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:55,688
He doesn't have the strength to
throw a piece of bread to a duck.

679
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,494
It scares the hell out of me.

680
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,463
Me, too.

681
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,098
John, what are you doing?

682
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,903
I'm offering Renzler
a deal he can't turn down.

683
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,657
Excuse me.
Morning. Dr. Renzler?

684
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,927
Dr. Renzler?

685
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,335
Sir, good morning.

686
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,933
John Crowley.
Crowley?

687
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,134
Yes, sir.
What are you doing here?

688
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,265
Good morning.
Good morning.

689
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:48,867
I understand from
your secretary that

690
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,446
you're going to be
leaving for France

691
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:51,741
for a month.
That's right.

692
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,316
I have a proposal for you,
and I was hopeful

693
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,542
that you could
take a look at it.

694
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:55,742
We're running
late for a flight.

695
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:59,311
I appreciate that. It'll only take a second,
just to have a quick read.

696
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,650
Fine. I'll read it in the car.
It might interest you.

697
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,191
Good, thank you.

698
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,102
Does Stonehill know about this?

699
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,643
Of course.

700
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:25,115
And he's okay with these terms?

701
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,616
All I need is your signature.

702
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,472
Hello?

703
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,806
<i>* I just need some place</i>

704
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:01,447
<i>* Where I can lay my head</i>

705
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,379
Bob.

706
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,819
Bob.

707
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:11,853
Bob!

708
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,396
Over here.

709
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,725
Bob.

710
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:22,497
Bob!

711
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,766
Hi. Bob.

712
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,277
What'd you do to yourself?

713
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,480
I got the investment from Renzler.

714
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,223
You what?

715
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,384
Listen, I want you to

716
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,696
think about something
before you read that.

717
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:47,855
What the hell is this?

718
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:52,402
Under the circumstances, this is
the best deal that we could ever get.

719
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:57,236
This isn't a deal.
This is the terms of our surrender, for...

720
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,468
Renzler comes in for
a couple million now,

721
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,704
and you give him the option
of jumping in as a full partner later?

722
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,440
Well, after sabotaging our meeting,

723
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,879
I had to do something dramatic.

724
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,441
And you promise him we'll be
in clinical trials in a year?

725
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,645
We can do this, Bob.
All right?

726
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,722
We work harder, we push ourselves,
we work around the clock.

727
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,122
I already work around the clock!

728
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,057
Why don't you just give 'em
my balls in a jelly jar?

729
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,562
There's no other way I could get
them to come back to the table.

730
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,929
Who needs the bastards anyway!

731
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,434
Without Renzler,
there's no reason for us

732
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,629
to even think about
other venture groups.

733
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,638
Fine! Then I won't think about
other venture groups!

734
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,140
Great!

735
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:34,904
Spend the rest of
your life dreaming up

736
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,480
great ideas that
don't get funded.

737
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:42,748
Draw brilliant diagrams on the wall
that cure diseases in theory,

738
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,585
but never help a single
human being in reality.

739
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:23,860
What'd you do?
Let me see it.

740
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,485
It's just barely...
Let me see.

741
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,633
Put pressure on it.

742
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,971
Got your blood
all over this thing.

743
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,345
Want me to add a drop of mine,
make it official?

744
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,753
Or would a signature suffice?

745
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,061
Bob?

746
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,047
<i>* I picked up my bag</i>

747
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,150
<i>* I went lookin' for
a place to hide</i>

748
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:33,196
<i>* When I saw Carmen and
the Devil walkin' side by side</i>

749
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:39,399
<i>* I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on,
let's go downtown."</i>

750
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:45,964
<i>* She said, "I gotta go,
but my friend can stick around"</i>

751
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:50,637
<i>* Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free</i>

752
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:55,182
I'm not paying a dollar more
than 22,000 a unit, okay?

753
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,274
I'm not doing it.

754
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,217
Hi, Bob.

755
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,230
These guys
make me feel old.

756
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:13,100
Scientists get all sensible and
careful when they get old.

757
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:15,501
Young ones like risk,

758
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,834
not afraid of new ideas,

759
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,074
and you can pay 'em less.

760
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,047
We all believe in Bob Stonehill's

761
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,051
bold vision, otherwise
you wouldn't be here.

762
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,918
But to reach clinical
trials inside of a year,

763
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:39,459
I'm gonna have to ask you
to commit to a brutal schedule.

764
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:45,024
Ladies and gentlemen,
reset your watches to Priozyme Time.

765
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,400
How long?

766
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,802
3, 4 hours.

767
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,515
Well, if you can get it any quicker,
that'd be good.

768
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,173
I'll try.

769
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,489
Come on.

770
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,789
Vinh, check the breakers.
Got it.

771
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,601
No, the whole building's out.

772
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,864
Well, get the backup
generator going.

773
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,197
We...
Wait, wait, wait.

774
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,970
You never bothered
to buy a backup generator?

775
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,841
We're in the middle
of tornado country,

776
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,413
for Christ's sake!
Yeah, so I'm a meteorologist?

777
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,210
If I don't have my
refrigeration back

778
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,444
in 45 minutes,
I lose the whole cell line.

779
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,714
4 months of work pissed away!

780
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,757
It was never in the budget.
We never had the money for it.

781
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,725
I'm sorry, sir.
Your card, it's been denied.

782
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,490
What?

783
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,723
It got maxed out. I bought
the roller bottle unit for the lab.

784
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,426
Shit, I...

785
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:00,300
Just pay me back by the end of the month,
or I lose my apartment.

786
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,571
Hi, here you go. Thanks.

787
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:06,943
Yes!

788
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,046
Yes!

789
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,053
Sir.

790
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,794
Thank you.

791
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:35,266
Fiona's in Mexico this week.
They've got pyramids there.

792
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,670
She's still got lots of things to see

793
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,613
before she gets to Antarctica.

794
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,414
Yeah.

795
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,657
She's gonna chop up all the
penguins with an ax.

796
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,452
And feed their bloody remains
to the walruses.

797
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:55,963
I see.

798
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:58,856
What?

799
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,995
Every time you come home for the weekend,
you don't even listen to me.

800
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,469
Megs.

801
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,975
You know what,
you're right. I'm sorry.

802
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,578
It's just that
I've been so busy

803
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,876
trying to make the special medicine
for you and Patrick.

804
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,280
I want it pink.

805
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:17,316
You want what?
The special medicine.

806
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,217
I want it to be pink.

807
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,488
Okay. I guess I can
ask Dr. Stonehill.

808
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,152
Tell him dark pink,
like this.

809
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,921
Not light pink.
That's for babies.

810
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,160
Okay.

811
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,364
Here you go.

812
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:39,840
Dr. Renzler, be reasonable.
The company is only 6 months old,

813
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,912
and we are making great progress
towards in vivo testing.

814
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,776
I don't know.
The way the company is burning money...

815
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,213
Well, we've got to get
a leg up on the competition.

816
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,685
You know that Zymagen has far
more spending power than we do.

817
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,018
So, what you're saying,
I should have invested in Zymagen.

818
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,252
No, what I'm saying is, is that
we've got to beat 'em to the punch.

819
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:59,794
Either that, or scare
them into buying us out.

820
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,396
Well, you're scaring us investors

821
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,160
a hell of a lot more than
you're scaring Zymagen.

822
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,199
You sell the company
to Zymagen,

823
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,897
you're in clinical trials
by the end of the fiscal year,

824
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,497
or we pull the plug and cut our losses.
Goodbye.

825
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,339
Hello?

826
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:28,050
This construct's
looking pretty good,

827
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,785
but we gotta get
better cleavage

828
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,589
between the alpha
and the beta subunits.

829
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,895
Well, what if we
add a furin site

830
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,124
like the one in
uncovering enzyme?

831
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,097
Why would you wanna do that?
Doesn't it have its own...

832
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,327
We need to talk.

833
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,131
I'm busy.
You're always busy.

834
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,761
You always wanna talk.

835
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:46,569
Yeah, we could add furin and try
and cleave it before purification.

836
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:50,970
What are you doing?

837
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,070
Giving you a preview...

838
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,308
Guys, would you
excuse us for a minute?

839
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:57,682
of what's going to happen if we
are not in clinical trials in 4 months.

840
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,719
Our investors will
turn out the lights.

841
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,293
Science takes time, Jersey.
Don't they understand?

842
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,193
Yeah, they do.
They can read the Wall Street Journal.

843
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:12,233
They see that Zymagen is testing
3 different Pompe drugs.

844
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,735
They're testing 3 'cause they don't
know what the hell they're doing.

845
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,170
I'm testing one 'cause it's the right one!

846
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,400
I know. I believe you, Bob.

847
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,477
Why else do you think
I put up with all your shit?

848
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:23,807
Look.

849
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:30,718
I want you to go toe-to-toe
with Zymagen's scientists.

850
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,516
Prove to them that
your enzyme is best.

851
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:34,612
I can do that.

852
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,919
That's the reason I've entered
into conversations with them

853
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,755
to buy our company.

854
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,760
You're telling me?
You're not asking me?

855
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:46,232
Come on, Bob.
I am just being fiscally responsible.

856
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,032
Nobody is gonna tell me
how to run my lab!

857
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,667
If I can engineer a deal,
and that is a really big "if,"

858
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:54,801
you're going to
have to forgive me

859
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,310
for all the money
I'm gonna make you.

860
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,347
I don't care about money.

861
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:02,407
I'm a scientist. I care about
more important things than that.

862
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,855
Don't you tell me about more
important things to care about.

863
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,716
Do the math.

864
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:16,029
Either we sell the company
and get a huge cash infusion,

865
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,361
or the investors
will shut us down.

866
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,075
Where you going?

867
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:40,623
I'm gonna go take a crap,
if that meets with your fiscal approval.

868
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:03,006
What, they can't drive from
the airport like ordinary people?

869
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,614
Bob, we need to
make this happen.

870
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,744
They're gonna ask us
some tough questions.

871
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:14,350
Don't take 'em personally, all right?
All right?

872
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,527
These lab results confirm
what I've been preaching for years,

873
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:33,472
that phosphorylation is key
to enzyme absorption.

874
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,812
My theory works for Pompe,

875
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:40,781
and eventually it'll work for
enzyme replacement therapies

876
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,648
for other lysosomal
storage disorders.

877
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,017
Is it too complicated?

878
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,384
Too complicated?

879
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:48,923
The number of
variables built into

880
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,323
your approach
are mind-boggling.

881
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,525
I mean, Jesus,
if you get even one piece wrong

882
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,961
in the synthesis,

883
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,124
just one carbohydrate
ends up in the wrong position...

884
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,533
Well, it's gotta be done right,
like anything worth doing.

885
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,835
You've never actually gotten
a drug approved.

886
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,136
Isn't it naive to
think you can solve

887
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,609
these kinds of
manufacturing challenges?

888
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,818
You're right, I'm a theory guy.

889
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,987
My head is in the clouds.

890
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,057
Which is why we need you.

891
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,660
Unless, of course,
your reputation for solving

892
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,797
protein-manufacturing
problems is undeserved.

893
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,441
Nice one.

894
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:44,877
I still need to hear
about profitability.

895
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,713
Certainly, certainly.

896
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:53,253
As you know, this is not a one-time
treatment. It's a lifelong therapy.

897
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,186
And these patients,

898
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,954
they are going to
generate revenue

899
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,223
over the span of
their lifetime that is...

900
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,764
But even if you
make a usable enzyme,

901
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:05,265
clearly it won't work for all patients.

902
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,993
So, what survival rate do we need
to achieve a robust profit?

903
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:13,131
What rate of patient death
can be defined as acceptable loss?

904
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:16,068
Acceptable loss?

905
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,945
I understand the question.

906
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:29,124
Because the profit margins
on this orphan drug

907
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,524
are so incredibly high, the...

908
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,328
Even with
a mortality rate of,

909
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:39,527
say, 25% over 5 years still indicates

910
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,771
that there is a highly lucrative

911
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,773
revenue source to be realized.

912
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,087
Gentlemen, we have a deal.

913
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,505
Dr. Robert Stonehill
to see Barry Renee.

914
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:00,345
I have a Dr. Robert Stonehill
to see Dr. Renee.

915
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,682
Sir, you need to be cleared.

916
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,276
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

917
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,878
You need to be cleared to do that, sir.

918
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,354
Just need to...

919
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,982
You need a security badge.

920
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,750
Jesus.

921
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,992
Well, can I have a security badge
so I can go take a pee?

922
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:20,897
Yes, sir.
He will give that to you.

923
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:30,472
Hey, Bob.

924
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:33,413
Hey, John.
You getting comfortable?

925
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,781
Define "comfortable."

926
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,451
You haven't cashed it yet?

927
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,418
I haven't earned it yet.

928
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,455
I'll cash it when we
have a usable enzyme.

929
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:11,512
Well, it sure is beautiful.

930
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,290
It sure is big.

931
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,093
The kids love it.

932
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,099
Seize the day.

933
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:36,875
Okay.

934
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,080
I'm stuck on this call.

935
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,887
Just wanted to let
you know how thrilled

936
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,358
we are to have
you onboard, John.

937
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,088
It's an honor.

938
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,924
You remember Dr. Kent Webber.
Of course.

939
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,261
It's good to see you again.
Good to see you, too.

940
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,858
I'll let the 2 of you get into it.

941
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,734
I'm expecting great things.

942
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,430
Yes, sir.

943
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,273
I've got some pretty good ideas

944
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,439
about how to help
the flow of information

945
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:15,517
between the 4 core enzyme groups.

946
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:19,018
John, slow down.
That's not our established procedure.

947
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,247
Pardon me?

948
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,119
The 4 core teams are essentially

949
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,056
in competition with each other.

950
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,319
It's an entrepreneurial
model. It works.

951
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:32,093
I'm all for competition,
but surely there must be some channel

952
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,864
for allowing sharing
scientific insights

953
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:39,135
that can help develop
all 4 enzymes.

954
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:43,975
John, in the interest of saving us time,
let me be blunt.

955
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,443
Most of the scientists
here don't like the idea

956
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,646
of having a non-scientist
as senior VP of the Pompe program.

957
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:55,180
Especially one whose objectivity

958
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:59,055
might be clouded by having children
with the disease.

959
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:03,393
I'm telling you this in your own
best interests.

960
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,299
Erich wanted to buy
Stonehill's ideas,

961
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,336
and he couldn't do
that without also

962
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,667
swallowing you as
part of the pill.

963
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:17,872
My advice to you, John,
is to keep your head down.

964
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,442
Thank you for that wisdom.

965
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,212
You're very welcome.

966
01:05:28,525 --> 01:05:31,493
All of your lab notebooks must be
submitted to the review committee!

967
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,062
This is my lab now! Get out!

968
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,391
I'm just trying to
explain the protocol!

969
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,931
You're wasting my time.

970
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,499
Dr. Stonehill...

971
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,264
Fine.

972
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,540
What do you want?

973
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:52,612
I just dropped by
to say that I think

974
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,410
that we might be
missing an opportunity

975
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,281
to open a dialogue with
the other 3 core teams.

976
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,947
The other core teams?
Core teams.

977
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,580
Core bullshit.

978
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,789
I'll come back another time.

979
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:12,592
The decline in muscle strength
is very troubling, of course,

980
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:16,068
but it's really, in both kids,

981
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:20,734
the organ enlargement, the liver,
and especially the heart,

982
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:23,641
that's the real
threat to their lives.

983
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,643
We'll continue to monitor
the rate of cardiac enlargement.

984
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,148
We'll keep tabs on
their other organs...

985
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:30,718
How long?

986
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,217
I don't like to predict.
Please.

987
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:36,951
Dr. Waldman,
we won't hold you to it.

988
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:38,287
We just need to
know something.

989
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,952
John.

990
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:44,129
How much more time do we have?
How long?

991
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:46,967
Well,

992
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,970
if there's another respiratory crisis,
all bets are off,

993
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,441
but otherwise,

994
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,344
Megan, maybe a year.

995
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:05,351
Patrick, less.

996
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:10,390
Thank you.

997
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:26,502
Marcus.

998
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:27,667
Get the phone.
What?

999
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,745
The phone.
Who is it?

1000
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,604
Hello?

1001
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,272
Hi. Is that Marcus?

1002
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:34,710
Yeah, yeah.
What time is it?

1003
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:36,910
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's late.

1004
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,813
It's John Crowley.

1005
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,679
John, what you doin'?

1006
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,952
You okay?

1007
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,726
Hey, look,
I gotta ask you a favor.

1008
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,190
Morning, Gavin.
Morning, sir.

1009
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,858
Is my 11:00 with Henessey confirmed?

1010
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:56,836
Yes, and there's the breakfast
meeting down in the cafeteria.

1011
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,338
Breakfast meeting?

1012
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:01,001
There was an e-mail that
came in over the weekend.

1013
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:02,873
Everyone on the Pompe
project was invited.

1014
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:03,967
Who called the meeting?

1015
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,139
Mr. Crowley, I believe, sir.

1016
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,545
What?

1017
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:13,744
Something that people
ask me all the time

1018
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,414
is how we have 2 kids with Pompe.

1019
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:21,355
By the time we realized
that Megan had Pompe,

1020
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,423
I was already pregnant
with Patrick.

1021
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,365
I mean, I can't tell you
how many doctors we saw,

1022
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,199
and the message
was always the same,

1023
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:32,502
that there is no drug
to treat Pompe.

1024
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:36,408
But thanks to you, all of you,
that message is changing.

1025
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:40,572
What you've given us,
and a lot of other families, is hope.

1026
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,675
So, thank you.

1027
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,784
Good job, Aileen.

1028
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:51,617
Now I'd like to
welcome the Temple family,

1029
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,787
who've come all the way from Georgia
to be with us here today.

1030
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:03,231
Thanks, John.

1031
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:07,602
Hi.

1032
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,770
I'm Marcus.

1033
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:14,075
This is my wife, Wendy.

1034
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:17,084
Our daughter Lauren,
our oldest daughter,

1035
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:22,146
Lauren wanted to come today
and say hi to all you guys.

1036
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:25,660
She's a little weak,

1037
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:30,925
but she wanted us to show
you guys her picture

1038
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:34,061
and to send you her love.

1039
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:38,167
And this is our daughter, Megan.

1040
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,743
The most beautiful
girls are named Megan.

1041
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,975
Megan is 4 months old,
and you can't see it yet,

1042
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,341
but she has Pompe, too.

1043
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,665
I...

1044
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:11,639
I can't tell you what it means to us

1045
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:17,711
to have all of you working on
a medicine for our children.

1046
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:21,881
Thank you.

1047
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,318
Thanks so much.

1048
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,860
Hey, Kent.
John.

1049
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,664
So what did you think of the event?

1050
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:54,515
In medical research, John,
objectivity is key.

1051
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:59,078
If researchers get all emotional,

1052
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:03,817
all desperate to help suffering patients,
they'll cut corners.

1053
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,086
It's counterproductive.

1054
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:09,926
Counterproductive is having
4 core teams of scientists

1055
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:12,625
working together
on the same disease,

1056
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,862
but not talking to each other.

1057
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:18,370
Most of these guys have never even
seen a kid with Pompe before.

1058
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,237
I don't see how
that's relevant.

1059
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:24,574
Did you see Erich? That's the kind
of motivation that we need.

1060
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,442
I'm gonna ask him
to get the core team

1061
01:11:26,548 --> 01:11:29,142
to stop competing,
start working together.

1062
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:31,515
Create a leadership team.

1063
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:37,116
Well, if you hope to sell
this leadership team idea,

1064
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,420
there's only one
way to convince Erich.

1065
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:40,892
And what's that?

1066
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:43,863
Keep your guy,
Stonehill, off the team.

1067
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,099
In his short tenure here,
he's managed to alienate

1068
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,602
a remarkable number
of colleagues.

1069
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:53,467
You can't put him on a team that's
supposed to build cooperation.

1070
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:57,602
So, decide how badly
you want your leadership team,

1071
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:01,380
then do what you have to do.

1072
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,928
That's it.

1073
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,771
Dr. Stonehill, please.

1074
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,732
Turn it down. Yes.

1075
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,106
Yes, the music.

1076
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,245
I said down!

1077
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,781
This guy's impossible.

1078
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,682
I like that song.

1079
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,687
Hey.

1080
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,297
What's up, John?

1081
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,236
Everything all right at home?

1082
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,672
Yeah.

1083
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:03,807
Have you heard that Erich Loring

1084
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:07,211
has agreed to put together
a leadership team?

1085
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,314
Yeah, I heard some rumor about it.
What bullshit.

1086
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:13,650
Now I'm gonna have to spend
a couple of hours a week

1087
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:16,382
jawin' with Zymagen guys?

1088
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:17,885
No.

1089
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:22,129
No. No, you won't, 'cause
I'm not putting you on the team.

1090
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,293
What'd you say?

1091
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,397
I really wanted to.

1092
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:29,966
You're not putting me on the team?
Is that what you said?

1093
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,836
What are you,
some varsity track coach?

1094
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,703
They didn't buy our company

1095
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:38,871
'cause they like your
Ivy League charm, Jersey.

1096
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:41,011
It's me they wanted.

1097
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:44,847
You can't bench me.
It's against the laws of nature.

1098
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:48,980
You're still gonna be able to
prove that your theory is right.

1099
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,321
Yeah, but other
scientists are gonna

1100
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,918
evaluate my results,
right? Not me.

1101
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:58,561
Everyone here
reveres your science.

1102
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:03,831
This is about
interpersonal issues.

1103
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,097
Who put you up to this?

1104
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,937
The decision was mine.

1105
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:13,040
It's for the overall
good of the program.

1106
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,878
"For the overall
good of the program."

1107
01:14:17,385 --> 01:14:19,553
John, you really got
the corporate lingo down good.

1108
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:22,249
What's next, "Acceptable loss?"

1109
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:39,899
No.

1110
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,600
Does anybody really
know how to do this?

1111
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,301
Except for us.

1112
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:45,912
But wait, who's going?

1113
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:47,641
It's John's turn still.

1114
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:50,713
Nice one.

1115
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,084
Okay. I'll get it.

1116
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:02,062
Nice one, Megs.

1117
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,292
Hello? Marcus, hi.

1118
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,327
My God.

1119
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,836
Man. I almost got 'em down.

1120
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:13,135
You guys sit tight, okay?
Here, John, grab him.

1121
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:15,641
If there is anything we can do,
anything at all,

1122
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:17,735
will you call?

1123
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:21,379
Okay. We love
you guys so much.

1124
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,143
Okay, bye-bye.

1125
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,686
Aileen.

1126
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,116
That was Marcus Temple.

1127
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:34,526
Lauren...

1128
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:37,093
She...

1129
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:43,198
He said she went in her sleep,
that it was peaceful.

1130
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,964
How old is she?

1131
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,208
How old was Lauren?

1132
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:55,643
Lauren was 9 years old.

1133
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:04,782
Come here.

1134
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:18,904
That way, we can be certain that
we're developing the correct one.

1135
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:22,200
Forget certainty,
and let's try and figure out

1136
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,413
which enzyme has
the better odds.

1137
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:28,142
If we develop
only one enzyme,

1138
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,381
what would happen
if we guessed the wrong one?

1139
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,514
Mr. Crowley, I've asked Kent
to set up a testing protocol

1140
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,820
to help us guess right.

1141
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:42,394
We'll do an exhaustive
range of tests.

1142
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:46,262
I'm calling it
"The Mother of All Experiments."

1143
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,363
The 4 enzymes
will be color-coded,

1144
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,633
yellow, blue,
green and magenta,

1145
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,933
and known only by
those color codes

1146
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:58,274
so no researcher will know
which one he's testing.

1147
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:02,713
Only after we pick a winner,
the secret identity will be revealed.

1148
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,219
Come on, Megan!

1149
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,030
But I want to!

1150
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:30,670
Just roll your wrist.

1151
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:31,973
I can't.

1152
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,279
It's okay. It's all right.
Let's try another one.

1153
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,911
Okay. Let's try again. Ready?

1154
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,557
Ready?

1155
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,821
1, 2, 3, go!

1156
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,632
Big winner!
Yay!

1157
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:56,101
Here you go, look at that.
You got a penguin.

1158
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,782
Hey, Bob. Bob.

1159
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,477
How you doin'?

1160
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:19,184
I brought you some ribs.

1161
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:23,328
Not as good as the ones
from The Corner Saloon,

1162
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,490
but if you're hungry...

1163
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:37,839
What do you want?

1164
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:42,443
The results.

1165
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,884
"Mother of All Experiments."

1166
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,283
Well,

1167
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:51,617
which enzyme did they choose?

1168
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,288
The leadership team spent
the whole afternoon arguing.

1169
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,833
2 enzymes, coded yellow and green,
are ahead of the others,

1170
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:01,232
but it's too close to call.

1171
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:04,065
Tomorrow, we spend
the day hashing it out

1172
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,774
to decide which one to choose.

1173
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:11,905
Bob. I'm asking you to read this.

1174
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,983
I value your opinion more than
anyone else in the world.

1175
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,644
Well, maybe you should have valued
my opinion a little sooner,

1176
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,315
instead of playing hatchet man
for the bean counters.

1177
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:24,685
Get the hell out of my lab.

1178
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:27,785
It's in your interest
to know about this, Bob.

1179
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,498
Get out.

1180
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,229
Wouldn't it benefit you...
Get out.

1181
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:04,291
The green enzyme's the best.
Show 'em my analysis, they'll understand.

1182
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,095
Hey, wait up, Bob.

1183
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,968
Is the green enzyme yours?

1184
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,868
I recognize patterns
in the results.

1185
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,032
I'd know my baby
a mile away.

1186
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,610
So the green one is yours?
No.

1187
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,737
No, it's not.

1188
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:25,647
My theory is still the best,
but it's not ready for manufacture.

1189
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:30,085
Theirs is crude and uninspired,
but it's ready.

1190
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,161
Bob, I don't even know
the words to say thank you.

1191
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,631
Don't bother.

1192
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,826
I didn't do it for you.

1193
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:30,048
Yes, it is!

1194
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:34,219
My gosh.
Do you see the kite up there?

1195
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,051
Yeah.
That's so cool!

1196
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:37,818
Annie, careful!

1197
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:39,460
Building a bastion.

1198
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,960
Right there. Yeah.

1199
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,567
3!
Okay!

1200
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:47,930
Dad, like...
Ready?

1201
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:49,833
Dad, you promised
no more phone calls.

1202
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:52,429
I know. I know I did, but...
What's in there?

1203
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,008
We can take turns burying
the phone when I get back.

1204
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,577
Okay! I'll start digging a hole.

1205
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:57,906
You hold that for a sec.

1206
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,806
John Crowley.

1207
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,712
John, it's Kent Weber.

1208
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:05,013
Kent, hey. Did you get my suggested
protocol for the clinical trials?

1209
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:07,548
Yeah.

1210
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,149
You made some pretty
optimistic assumptions

1211
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,057
about where our
enzyme supply will be.

1212
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:15,893
I see.

1213
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:21,259
Well, what do you think
that a more realistic...

1214
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:24,167
John, I'll give to you straight.

1215
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,139
The clinical trial
will be for infants only.

1216
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,876
Infants need so
much less enzyme,

1217
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:33,777
and, as you know,
our initial supply will be so limited.

1218
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:37,946
And the drug has much higher
odds of being effective

1219
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,611
with infants than
with older children.

1220
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:44,191
We have to consult Erich on this.
We have to consult Erich.

1221
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,626
I already did. He confirmed
the decision. Infants only.

1222
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,223
I understand your
personal reasons for...

1223
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:59,235
These decisions have to be
made objectively, rationally.

1224
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:02,569
I'm sorry. I...

1225
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:05,269
I really am.

1226
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,464
Hold it, pal.

1227
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:25,605
Mr. Crowley, what are you
doin' in here?

1228
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,441
I was just...

1229
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:28,708
You're not authorized.

1230
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:31,216
No...
I can explain everything.

1231
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,150
What's the matter, Chuck?
Is there a problem?

1232
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,746
Yeah, there's a problem. I got
Mr. Crowley in here without clearance.

1233
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,223
That's my fault, now.

1234
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:40,794
I got busy in the lab,
I sent Jersey boy here

1235
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:43,420
to get me a couple
jugs of enzyme.

1236
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:45,429
Sorry.

1237
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,068
Thanks, Chuck.

1238
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:05,645
Thanks for saving my ass.

1239
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,080
It's really big of you,

1240
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:13,786
especially after what
went down between us.

1241
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,529
You mean your ruthless,
cold-hearted betrayal?

1242
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:25,830
Yeah, well, when I thought
about it from your point of view...

1243
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,701
Shit, if it was my
kids dying, I wouldn't

1244
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:31,278
have hesitated to
crush you like a bug.

1245
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,525
Do you remember
when we first met,

1246
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:53,828
and you told me that
I should stop chasing miracles

1247
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,836
and should go home
and enjoy my kids,

1248
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,367
while they're still here?

1249
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:07,704
Yeah. I made the wrong choice.

1250
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:26,361
Jersey, you know
what a sibling study is?

1251
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:27,892
No.

1252
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:30,163
It's a drug trial with just 2 patients

1253
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:32,637
with the same genetic inheritance.

1254
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:37,572
Siblings, with the same disease.

1255
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:39,304
Megs and Patrick.

1256
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:44,847
Well, would Zymagen
go for something like this?

1257
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:48,585
There's real research value in it.

1258
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:52,084
And with just two patients,
it wouldn't take much enzyme.

1259
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:54,889
But Webber would
have to sign off on it.

1260
01:28:56,264 --> 01:28:59,756
Well, let's not tell him till
we've got our ducks in a row.

1261
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:02,426
I could draw up a protocol
and see if I can find

1262
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:05,028
a hospital willing
to administer it.

1263
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:09,209
Bob.
Well, don't get your hopes up, kid.

1264
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,943
It's a Hail Mary.

1265
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:47,841
Ducks in a row.

1266
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:53,150
"Stonehill, careful review,
protocol, Sibling Trial, 146,

1267
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,652
"are pleased to inform you
Megan Crowley and Patrick

1268
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:56,348
"have been accepted
into the trial!"

1269
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:57,549
I just got it.

1270
01:29:57,658 --> 01:29:58,920
Quack, quack, quack.

1271
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:00,624
Have you talked to him yet?

1272
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:04,960
No. I did the science.
You make the sale.

1273
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:08,267
Thank you.

1274
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:10,601
Good luck.
Right.

1275
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:19,278
Does he have about 5?
He does, yeah.

1276
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,848
Thanks.
No problem, Mr. Crowley.

1277
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,719
Hey, Kent? Knock-knock.

1278
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:29,389
Got a minute?

1279
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:32,287
Kent?

1280
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:37,792
Do you have any idea what you've done?
Excuse me?

1281
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,367
We got a call this morning from
Portland Rose Hospital,

1282
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:42,765
about sending them
enzyme for your kids?

1283
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,304
Right. Yeah, I know.
That's what I'm here to talk to you about.

1284
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:49,240
You and Stonehill set this up behind
my back. Now you come to me.

1285
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,242
It's all tentative.

1286
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:55,475
You want this company
to sponsor a drug study,

1287
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:59,883
for 2 children whose father
is an executive of this company?

1288
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:02,012
Have you never heard the term
"conflict of interest?"

1289
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:03,249
It has nothing to do with a...

1290
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,188
Do you know what the FDA
would do if they found out?

1291
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,626
There is strong scientific justification
for this study.

1292
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:10,458
There is great research value.

1293
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:13,693
I'm a doctor, John.
I know the research value!

1294
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:17,766
But you guys just can't go off
half-cocked without consulting us!

1295
01:31:17,905 --> 01:31:19,668
And I'm sure that if we just go
and talk to Erich, we can...

1296
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:21,366
Erich already knows.

1297
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,671
He's furious about
being blindsided.

1298
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:25,311
I didn't try to
blindside anyone.

1299
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:29,008
This is the reason why
we have a reporting structure,

1300
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:32,950
why we have established procedure,
why there is protocol.

1301
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:37,280
You heartless,
bloodless machine.

1302
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:40,952
You just have to fight me every step
of the way! Don't you?

1303
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:42,619
You just hated it
when I brought

1304
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:44,960
the kids with Pompe
to the doorstep!

1305
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:46,465
You weren't thinking
about those kids

1306
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,967
when you put your
children into that program

1307
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,470
and jeopardized
a decade's worth of

1308
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:53,938
research investment
made by this company!

1309
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:56,703
This is not about
a return on an investment!

1310
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,540
It's about kids,

1311
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:02,143
kids with names, dreams,

1312
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,945
families that love them.

1313
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:08,418
You've jeopardized
your chances

1314
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:10,923
of ever getting
your kids treated.

1315
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:42,819
I'm not arguing
science with you!

1316
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:46,152
On every level!
On every level, you've stood...

1317
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:05,275
I was just drafting a letter of
apology for senior management,

1318
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:08,314
but I guess we're
past that point.

1319
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:14,180
I just spoke to Erich, and we are
terminating your employment.

1320
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:17,790
Okay, I'll pack up my stuff.

1321
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,883
Just one thing, John.

1322
01:33:20,027 --> 01:33:24,862
I may well be a tight-ass
pencil-pushing company man,

1323
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:27,297
but I resent being called heartless.

1324
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:29,801
Look...
Just let me finish.

1325
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:33,069
The reason we're terminating
your employment,

1326
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:36,176
is to eliminate the
conflict of interest.

1327
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:38,936
This strategy was
brought to my attention

1328
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:41,139
by our colleague,
Dr. Stonehill,

1329
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:43,475
in rather crude terms.

1330
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,247
This will allow the sibling trial
to proceed

1331
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:51,650
for its purely
scientific value.

1332
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:59,228
Have your desk cleared out
by the end of the day.

1333
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:02,362
Kent, what's with the...

1334
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:07,031
I wanted to make
sure you didn't

1335
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:09,336
punch me out before
I could tell you.

1336
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:12,540
Well...

1337
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:16,607
thank you very much for firing me.

1338
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:18,676
My pleasure.

1339
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:19,977
I never liked you.

1340
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:21,412
Likewise.

1341
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,057
Hey, you guys,
bring anything you want extra...

1342
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:28,185
Mom! Mom!
What?

1343
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:30,058
Can I bring the bow and arrow?
Yes, yes.

1344
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:35,063
Hey!

1345
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:42,433
John, what...

1346
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:44,571
What?

1347
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:50,983
We have a usable enzyme
that's ready for clinical trials.

1348
01:34:53,921 --> 01:34:55,786
When? When will it be ready?

1349
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:59,757
Megs and Patrick start their infusions
before the end of this month.

1350
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,987
My God.
Yeah.

1351
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:04,764
My God.

1352
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:08,161
John.

1353
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:10,827
Hey, John, Daddy's here.

1354
01:35:11,271 --> 01:35:13,098
Hi, guys.
Hey, Dad.

1355
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:15,737
Why is Mommy sad?

1356
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:19,609
Not sad, baby, so happy.

1357
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,281
So happy.

1358
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,285
Why is Mommy being so weird?

1359
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:29,015
Well, it's because
we got the special medicine

1360
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:30,783
for you, Megs,
and for you, Patrick,

1361
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,118
and you're gonna
get it really soon.

1362
01:35:32,726 --> 01:35:34,126
That's great!

1363
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,278
So, who wants to
push the button?

1364
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,524
Megs, Patrick, you ready?

1365
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:29,979
When will we know if it's working?

1366
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:32,143
It'll be a while, honey.

1367
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,845
It's not pink.

1368
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:16,827
Excuse me?
Your Uncle Bobby is here.

1369
01:37:18,432 --> 01:37:19,922
I don't know.

1370
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:28,235
You can go back if you like.

1371
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:29,637
Okay.

1372
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:37,141
John.
Uncle Bobby.

1373
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:41,447
They wouldn't let me in
unless I was family.

1374
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:45,920
Some things for the kids.

1375
01:37:46,227 --> 01:37:47,251
Thanks.

1376
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,953
Sleeping?

1377
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:56,326
Hey, thanks for coming.

1378
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:03,401
I'm a scientist.
Gotta track the experiment.

1379
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:16,311
I wish your enzyme was
the one that passed the test.

1380
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:19,452
But the one the kids are getting,

1381
01:38:19,793 --> 01:38:22,455
it's the right one, right? I mean...

1382
01:38:23,097 --> 01:38:24,997
It's gonna help them.

1383
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:31,928
Yeah, you guys have done
everything humanly possible.

1384
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:36,271
We just have to see
what the tests show.

1385
01:38:39,013 --> 01:38:41,914
You and I have had our differences,

1386
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:45,508
and I just want you
to know something.

1387
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:48,111
I want you to know that...

1388
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:49,985
Yeah.
Don't interrupt.

1389
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:51,352
Okay.

1390
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:57,020
I want you to know
that I appreciate everything

1391
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:59,029
that you've done
for Megs and Patrick,

1392
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:02,761
and I'm never gonna forget it
for the rest of my life.

1393
01:39:06,473 --> 01:39:08,441
Not gonna kiss me, is he?

1394
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:10,442
I will restrain him.

1395
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:13,540
Don't tempt me.

1396
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:20,684
Daddy loves SpongeBob,
Daddy loves SpongeBob.

1397
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:35,561
Stop!
Daddy loves SpongeBob.

1398
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:37,068
Guys?

1399
01:39:38,672 --> 01:39:40,367
What's going on?

1400
01:39:41,775 --> 01:39:43,504
What's so funny?

1401
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:46,738
What are you laughing at?

1402
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:51,243
What are you laughing at?

1403
01:39:52,119 --> 01:39:53,416
Sugar.

1404
01:39:57,124 --> 01:39:58,921
It's a sugar high.

1405
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:03,394
The enzyme's breaking down
the sugar in their muscles.

1406
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:04,963
The medicine's working?

1407
01:40:05,065 --> 01:40:06,225
Yeah.

1408
01:40:07,568 --> 01:40:08,762
John.

1409
01:40:17,811 --> 01:40:19,005
Megs!

1410
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:20,505
Hi.

1411
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,800
Subtitles: Arigon

1412
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:41,699
John, drive safe!
Enjoy the ride!

1413
01:40:44,805 --> 01:40:46,363
Rock and roll!

1414
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:48,740
Bye! Have fun.

1415
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:50,376
Bye!

1416
01:40:51,612 --> 01:40:55,207
<i>* So you could see the truth</i>

1417
01:40:56,650 --> 01:41:00,381
<i>* That this love I have inside</i>

1418
01:41:01,455 --> 01:41:05,289
