<i>An afternoon in late autumn.</i>

15
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:12,353
<i>Bars in the daytime</i>
<i>are like women without makeup.</i>

16
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,394
THE LILAC BAR

17
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,132
Not like that!

18
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,335
You got married in a church,

19
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,242
so kiss like foreigners do.

20
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,515
That's right!

21
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,783
Hurry up.

22
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,388
Not like that.
Try again.

23
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,521
Stop teasing.

24
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,595
He's sweating.

25
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,733
I'm surprised Miyuki got married first.
She loved working here.

26
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,943
Marriage is what
every woman wants.

27
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,644
Not me.

28
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,785
I'm going to save some money
and open my own place.

29
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,085
Shall we cut the cake?

30
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,922
Shouldn't we wait for Mama?

31
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:24,962
Mama?
We're waiting for you.

32
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,798
What?

33
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,177
Well, please hurry.

34
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,480
The owner's chewing out
Mama and Mr. Komatsu.

35
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,920
Mr. Komatsu?

36
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,581
I wonder why.

37
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,188
It's obvious.

38
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,518
"You're not making
enough money!"

39
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,630
I guess it isn't easy
being a mama.

40
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,727
Sales were down last month
and the month before.

41
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,428
Why?

42
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,501
Mama's doing her best.

43
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,612
Isn't it because
Mr. Minobe stopped coming in?

44
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,942
Sorry my phone call
took so long.

45
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:15,487
Mama, do you know
where Mr. Minobe goes these days?

46
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,756
Yuri's bar.

47
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,657
The same Yuri
who worked for you.

48
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,199
Minobe has contacts
at big companies.

49
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,996
If you call him,
he'll come by.

50
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,302
I wonder.

51
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,469
Your job
is to make money for me.

52
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,479
If sales are down again this month,
I'll replace you.

53
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,241
Understand?

54
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,522
Don't be so prim.
Yuri goes all out.

55
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:56,019
He's trying to humiliate me!
Telling me to do such a thing!

56
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,358
But business has plummeted.

57
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,866
Even so, I won't call him.

58
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,263
It's not just Mr. Minobe.

59
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,170
I've never begged
anyone to come in.

60
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,675
It's not pride.

61
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,047
I hate doing that.

62
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,691
I hate liquor,
yet I drink my fill every night.

63
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,883
Isn't that "going all out"?

64
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,956
Get your own place.

65
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,565
Where would I find a million yen?

66
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,258
Mama, don't worry.

67
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,835
Any of the 700 bars
in the Ginza would hire you.

68
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,504
What's that?
I hate that sound.

69
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,844
I've got a bill to collect on.
Regards to Miyuki.

70
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,224
- Mama!
- What happened?

71
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,164
Suicide.
The Bluebird hostess.

72
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,703
The fortune-teller was right.

73
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,396
Fortune-teller?

74
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,634
I took her to a fortune-teller
who predicted misfortune,

75
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,745
and it hit her hard.

76
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,258
Something awful's happened!

77
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,527
I heard.

78
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,424
I'm sorry I'm late.

79
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,891
The Bluebird was
heavily mortgaged.

80
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,298
- I heard it was a love triangle.
- Not debt?

81
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:49,339
Her patron and her lover
had a fight.

82
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,872
How old was she?

83
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,343
Forty-three,
but she looked younger.

84
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,946
- Aging's hard on a woman.
- I'd better save up for the old folks' home.

85
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,977
Enough of that talk.

86
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,153
Sing, somebody!

87
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:12,921
We've got a train to catch.
Thanks for everything.

88
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,329
I'll go see them off.

89
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,569
He could at least buy
second-class tickets.

90
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,941
Try to think more positively.

91
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,775
It won't be easy!

92
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:35,044
Be grateful you got
a chance to marry.

93
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,916
Compared to handling drunks,

94
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,422
his mother will be easy.

95
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,858
Mr. Matsui,
take good care of her.

96
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,162
We're not far.
Please come visit.

97
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,063
Thank you.

98
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,040
<i>As the office girls</i>
<i>are leaving work,</i>

99
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,436
<i>our work is just beginning.</i>

100
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,650
This is nice.
Or is it too plain?

101
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:12,655
No, but it's a bit matronly.

102
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,790
Really? I'd still like it.

103
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,292
You sure?

104
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,832
Twin matches - good luck!

105
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,077
Stop acting
like a cheap cabaret girl.

106
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,615
It's vulgar.

107
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,118
You sure know how to eat.

108
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,811
You just ruined the taste.

109
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,260
- Other shops sell these for less.
- Ours are better.

110
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,089
I'll take these.
How about a discount?

111
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,356
You'll ruin me!

112
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,158
How much is this?

113
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,193
Don't say that.
Just come by.

114
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,703
We haven't seen you
in so long.

115
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,672
I'm Ionely. I really am.

116
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,679
Welcome!

117
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,246
Don't bother.
He's from the savings plan.

118
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,545
Sorry I'm late.

119
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,315
So it's 100 yen from Sachiko,
and 200 from Kiyomi.

120
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,582
It's all here, pops.

121
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,395
<i>Night fell...</i>

122
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,501
<i>I hated climbing those stairs</i>
<i>more than anything.</i>

123
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,868
<i>But once I was up,</i>
<i>I would take each day as it came.</i>

124
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,318
Mr. Minobe, welcome.

125
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,716
You're quite a stranger.

126
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,987
You called, so here I am.

127
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,654
You'd completely disappeared.

128
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,558
Pardon me a moment.

129
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:07,295
Mr. Minobe's here.
Did you call him?

130
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,801
I said it was the Lilac Bar calling,
not you.

131
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,740
Same thing.
He's my customer.

132
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,275
Don't meddle.

133
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,177
It's business.

134
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,619
Just don't.

135
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,625
Do you like this tiepin?

136
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,058
Very nice.

137
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,825
You're not even looking.
I bought it for you.

138
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,127
For me?

139
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,530
Put it on.

140
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,003
- No, give it to a customer.
- But -

141
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,301
Good evening.

142
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,275
They're cracking down.
It's harder to get the goods.

143
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,179
- You mean Tetsu got caught?
- Yeah.

144
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,116
Next time I'll be the one
sent to the slammer.

145
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:01,990
You've got it good here,
surrounded by girls,

146
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,185
and with a regular paycheck.

147
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,328
That girl's crazy about you.

148
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:12,163
- I'm not interested in the girls here.
- Really?

149
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:16,307
You can't succeed as a manager here
if you fiddle with the goods.

150
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,842
Maybe, but what a waste!

151
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,046
Welcome.

152
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,108
You've got new girls,
but this place is dead!

153
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,017
That's because it's still early.

154
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,555
Right, Mama?

155
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,250
He's hinting
it's because he's been away.

156
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,630
That's right.

157
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,123
So come by every night.
- This place is so routine.

158
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,926
How rude!

159
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,969
You can't take him seriously.

160
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,836
He'll always act mean

161
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,601
and then turn on the charm.

162
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,009
- Is that true?
- That's my... routine.

163
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:01,878
But seriously,
I've run a lot of companies.

164
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:06,815
Any place headed downhill
is always depressing like this.

165
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,588
I see.
Is Yuri's place lively?

166
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,129
You bet.
Not like here.

167
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,528
Want to see for yourself?

168
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,332
Please.
I could learn a lot.

169
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,569
Welcome!

170
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,102
Is this seat okay?

171
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,305
Mari.

172
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,612
Mr. Inagaki came by last night.

173
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:39,790
<i>Yuri worked for me</i>
<i>until last summer.</i>

174
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,190
<i>She has a gift</i>
<i>for handling men.</i>

175
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,460
Forgive me
for neglecting you.

176
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,867
Care for a drink?

177
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,003
My stomach's been bothering me.

178
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,903
- Swimming in dough, eh?
- Sure. Maybe I'll lend it out.

179
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,703
Can you teach me
to calculate interest?

180
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,004
Don't imply
that's my line of work.

181
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,983
- It's great you're so busy.
- Thanks.

182
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,520
Actually, I barely scrape by.

183
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,584
Liar.
Didn't you buy a new car?

184
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,989
A used one that barely runs.

185
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:22,031
It uses so much gas
it drives me crazy.

186
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,725
- Still, you're succeeding.
- See, she -

187
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:29,374
Be quiet and drink.
Mama and I have a lot to talk about.

188
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,001
Mama, that kimono is stunning.

189
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,740
Those stripes really suit you.
I gasped when I saw you come in.

190
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,418
Your dress is lovely too.

191
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,456
Enough. I'm not paying
to listen to this chatter.

192
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,122
Well, hello there!

193
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,928
Hello.

194
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,778
I used to see him
at your place.

195
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,850
A brewery executive.
He's very nice.

196
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,318
<i>Mr. Minobe.</i>

197
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,884
Sorry I've been out of touch.
Busy as usual?

198
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,896
Only at night.
Business is dead.

199
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,762
Always the kidder.
Excuse me.

200
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,306
He's president
of an appliance firm.

201
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,339
I taught him how to use
a radio during the war.

202
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,205
Now his company's thriving.

203
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,912
Shall I introduce you?

204
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,174
Yes, please.

205
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,011
No problem.

206
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,414
I'm leaving for Izu tonight
to go golfing. Come along.

207
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:58,153
I can't golf.
What would be the point?

208
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,088
I'll play the golf, okay?

209
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,129
It's too sudden.

210
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:10,674
Your place just phoned.
A guest...

211
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,236
Thank you.

212
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,707
I'll be going.

213
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,509
I'll be here. Phone me.

214
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:23,648
Leaving already?

215
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,447
I'll drive you back.

216
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,517
Don't bother.
Walking's faster.

217
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,157
Please come again.

218
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,962
Take care.

219
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,643
Mama, scouting out the enemy?

220
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,542
I know where you're going.
Please, go ahead.

221
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,278
It's my first time here.
Yuri won't stop calling.

222
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,644
I'll drop by later.

223
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,520
Really?

224
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,420
I'll be waiting.

225
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,402
What were you and Mama
talking about?

226
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,265
Gimme a refill.

227
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,877
<i>What to do?</i>

228
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:30,154
<i>The time to decide was looming.</i>

229
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,697
<i>I went to work at a new bar.</i>

230
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,442
<i>Only a few leaves were left</i>
<i>on the sycamores.</i>

231
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:57,972
How nice to see you!
When did you arrive from Osaka?

232
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,147
Last night. An emergency
shareholders meeting.

233
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,050
I see. This way, please.

234
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,289
- I had a hard time finding the place.
- Forgive me.

235
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,962
I lost your map card.

236
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:14,964
Welcome.

237
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,428
He drinks Black & White with water.
Don't forget.

238
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,100
- Nice place.
- Thank you.

239
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,970
Making more than before?

240
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,112
It's always money with you.

241
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,042
That's the most important thing.

242
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,811
Foreigners ask for the price list
before they even drink a glass of juice.

243
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,921
And they pay up front.

244
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:44,222
Did Mama give Minobe
the brush-off?

245
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,890
Where'd you hear that?
Besides, how would we know?

246
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,794
You're well trained.

247
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,598
Is my face red?

248
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,242
I may look sturdy,
but I can't drink at all.

249
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,708
Then why come to a bar?

250
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:05,316
I can't stand sitting at home
once the lights go on.

251
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,246
But aren't you married?

252
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,387
Not even close.

253
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,649
Should I call Mama?

254
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,849
That's okay.
I'm not her only customer.

255
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,687
You're so nice!

256
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,489
I'd like to marry a man like you.

257
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,063
I'm honored.

258
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,895
It's true.
Handsome men are conceited.

259
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,470
May I have a drink?

260
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,873
Sorry to neglect you.

261
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,906
Yukiko, could you go to the bar?

262
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,836
Have a drink on me.

263
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,547
Thanks.

264
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,314
Mama doesn't have a patron?

265
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,216
No, she's too virtuous.

266
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,985
She'll cave in eventually.
A woman's a woman.

267
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,524
Want to bet?

268
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,494
- On what?
- On who'll get her.

269
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,036
All her regular guests are here.

270
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,562
Let's see.

271
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,872
That old man from Osaka
has the most money...

272
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,740
but she likes the banker best.

273
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,142
Odds are on him.

274
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,215
What about the fat fellow?

275
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,012
Not even in the running.

276
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,556
Did you put on a little weight?

277
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,282
Hardly, with all my debts.

278
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,188
That can't be.

279
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,922
Nothing's harder than
running a 30-man factory.

280
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,599
Is that so?

281
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,392
You're thinner.

282
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,264
Am I?
It's stressful changing bars.

283
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,066
- But even prettier.
- Thank you.

284
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,368
- You like tempura?
- I love it.

285
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,442
I'll treat you tomorrow.

286
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,136
Can't.

287
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,510
I have to see a customer off
at the airport.

288
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,480
Some other time then.

289
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,153
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,586
Welcome!

291
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,318
Did Mr. Goda arrive?

292
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,961
Mr. Fujisaki's a regular too.

293
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,457
Yes.

294
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,203
That guest told me
to hold this for him.

295
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,207
There's 500,000 yen inside!

296
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,778
Don't fall for that.

297
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,346
It's true!

298
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,081
Silly.

299
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,725
He's just trying to get you
to go out with him.

300
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,451
It's just for show?

301
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,721
Leave it with Komatsu.

302
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,500
How about dinner tomorrow?

303
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,675
- What time?
- Any time.

304
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,403
I'll call you.

305
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,149
Leaving so soon?

306
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,046
Stay a bit.

307
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,743
I have to meet someone.

308
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,117
Keep the drinks flowing
for my men there.

309
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,206
How about dinner tomorrow?

310
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,843
Okay. I'll call you tomorrow.

311
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,315
Take care.

312
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,667
<i>Between 11:30 and midnight,</i>

313
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:49,239
<i>the Ginza's 16,000 hostesses</i>
<i>head home in droves.</i>

314
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,934
<i>The best go by cab...</i>

315
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,081
<i>the second-rate take the train...</i>

316
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,777
<i>and the worst go off</i>
<i>with their customers.</i>

317
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,752
Junko.

318
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,063
Tomoko, you'll miss the last train.

319
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,862
Goodness! Bye now.

320
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,594
You forgot this.

321
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:23,502
Silly me! It's for my son's
school trip tomorrow.

322
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,040
Good-bye.

323
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,101
- Good night.
- Good-bye.

324
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,506
Welcome.

325
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,614
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

326
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,842
The sign's still on outside.

327
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,610
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,713
She's drunk again.

329
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,491
I'll take her to my apartment.

330
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:47,630
Keiko,
isn't that kimono a bit plain?

331
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,427
Is it?

332
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,438
Wear something flashier.

333
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,978
The Carton Bar.

334
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,243
A call for you.

335
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,821
What is it?

336
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,928
No, we can't provide
geisha this late.

337
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:23,932
Give them some sushi,
then kick them out.

338
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,205
I'm busy, so I'll be brief.

339
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:36,109
I paid the 170,000 yen
your guests owed at the Lilac

340
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:39,010
so you'd be free
to work for me here.

341
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:44,678
It's just a formality, but please
put your seal on this receipt.

342
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,052
I'll collect the money soon
and pay you back.

343
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,852
I'll be going.

344
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,226
No need to see me out.

345
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,037
Did the owner leave?

346
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:05,002
I hate to ask, but could you
collect on bills again tomorrow?

347
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,744
She'll probably
want interest too.

348
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,087
I'll get a cab.
Will you bring Junko?

349
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,531
<i>Back home...</i>

350
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:32,426
<i>I felt tired</i>
<i>and a little drunk.</i>

351
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:42,142
<i>My rent is 30,000 yen,</i>
<i>a lot for one person.</i>

352
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,111
<i>But for us Ginza hostesses,</i>

353
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,047
<i>an apartment's</i>
<i>a fashionable accessory...</i>

354
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:52,448
<i>just like expensive clothes</i>
<i>and perfumes.</i>

355
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,561
Junko!

356
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,526
Oh, it's you.

357
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,597
Mama wanted to come,

358
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,965
but relatives
arrived from Nagoya.

359
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:17,107
She asked me
to extend her apologies.

360
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,774
I see.

361
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,970
We'd appreciate
payment soon, sir.

362
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,351
I've overspent this month.

363
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:37,585
I'd prefer to pay
these two bills next month.

364
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,195
I understand.

365
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:44,466
But they're bills
from the old bar, so...

366
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:48,467
Mama's having a hard time too.

367
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:54,809
Yes, her aunt and uncle
just came from Nagoya.

368
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,345
She asked me to apologize.

369
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,674
Me?
I'm watching her place.

370
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:06,289
But please do visit
our bar again.

371
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,685
Okay?

372
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,792
Good-bye.

373
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,129
The man from Osaka was furious.

374
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,357
Was he?

375
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:20,003
It's still easier
than saying no to his face.

376
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,564
You're right.

377
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,242
I just learned a new trick.

378
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,005
Mama...

379
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,678
who's your favorite customer?

380
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,581
I don't know.

381
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,114
I do.

382
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,184
Mr. Fujisaki?

383
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,490
I don't dislike him.

384
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:46,457
But in our business

385
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,361
we have to treat
every man like a lover.

386
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,092
You can't love just one man.

387
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,830
Too bad.

388
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,069
I could love
just one rich man.

389
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,438
That 500,000 yen from last night -
I can still see it.

390
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,241
Let's not talk shop.

391
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,681
Here.

392
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,353
Thank you.

393
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,955
Your omelettes are as good
as a restaurant's.

394
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,158
My late husband loved omelettes.

395
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,796
I hate to cook.

396
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:28,170
- Even rice?
- I use an electric cooker.

397
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,166
I thought you'd say that.

398
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,005
You still have to know
how to use it.

399
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:39,975
You'll have a hard time
when you get married.

400
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,113
I had it hard at first.

401
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,948
At first?

402
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,852
Oh, when you got married?

403
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:53,025
I've always wanted to ask:

404
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,756
What was your husband like?

405
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,096
Handsome?

406
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,236
There's a photograph
in the family shrine.

407
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,273
May I?

408
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,787
Isn't he good-Iooking?

409
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,693
He's kind of chubby.
I'm disappointed.

410
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,898
He wasn't really handsome,
but he was so kind.

411
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,297
Maybe because he was
ten years older.

412
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,211
I was just out of high school.

413
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,041
I caused him such grief
with my selfishness.

414
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:50,584
He died so soon.
I wish I'd been nicer.

415
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,714
But he looked so healthy.
Was it illness?

416
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:57,861
No, he got hit by a truck.

417
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,859
Poor man.

418
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,626
It's hard to forget someone
you lose so unexpectedly.

419
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,862
Mama...

420
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,504
is it true you put
a love letter in his urn?

421
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,339
Who told you that?

422
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:23,215
Mr. Komatsu said you told him
once when you were drunk.

423
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:32,660
It's a beautiful,
romantic thing to do.

424
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:38,867
When I heard that,
I respected you so much.

425
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,498
Silly girl. It's not true.

426
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,602
That's Komatsu for you.

427
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,509
It was in a novel I read.

428
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,411
A novel?

429
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,245
What a letdown!

430
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,623
But my husband
was such a good person.

431
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,460
Is that why nobody else
can win your heart?

432
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,995
It's not that.

433
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,168
It just seems so dirty.

434
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,530
It's not my way.

435
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:17,074
If a woman does such things,

436
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,243
her charm disappears.

437
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:24,308
Aren't you Ionely sometimes?

438
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,316
Sure.

439
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,176
But I have a brandy
and go to sleep.

440
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,412
That kind of fever soon passes.

441
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,981
You really have some self-control!

442
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:41,292
I clench my teeth
so hard they hurt.

443
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,130
Honest?

444
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,035
You're so gullible!

445
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,068
Oh, you!

446
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:55,310
A woman shouldn't be loose.

447
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:59,279
That's one rule I've followed.

448
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,410
I'm not a prude,

449
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:07,853
but if I let go once,
it'd be too hard to stop.

450
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,523
Maybe I'm just a coward.

451
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,789
Don't sit there thinking.
Your food's getting cold.

452
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,438
Hello?

453
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,131
Mother?

454
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,039
Just a second.

455
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,475
Junko, please get the door.

456
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,580
What is it?

457
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:40,213
30,000 yen?
This is too sudden.

458
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,916
The kimono-maker's bill
is due today.

459
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:47,924
Wait a couple days.
I'll send it with your monthly allowance.

460
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,363
Listen, did you make
your pickled cabbage?

461
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,299
Bring some when you come.

462
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,066
Don't catch cold.

463
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,139
Good morning.
How'd it go?

464
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,043
Let me eat first.
I'm starving.

465
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,682
Fujisaki finally paid,

466
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:12,322
but Mr. Goda won't pay
unless you ask him personally.

467
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,219
He flashed the money
but wouldn't hand it over.

468
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:19,863
I'll go see him tomorrow.
The usual inn at Tsukiji?

469
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,133
Won't he try to seduce you?

470
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:31,305
They try all the time,
but it can only work if I let them.

471
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,478
Famous last words.

472
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,543
You've heard of
Nobuko at Club 8?

473
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:46,384
She wouldn't even give in
to a cabinet member.

474
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,953
But then she fell in love
with some down-and-out guitarist.

475
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,620
Now she's a maid
in a love hotel.

476
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,762
I started as a busboy
in the Ginza ten years ago.

477
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,097
I've seen a lot like her.

478
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,966
What's your point?

479
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,142
Just sharing my experience.

480
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,438
Good marmalade.

481
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,477
Thanks for coming.

482
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:23,025
Yesterday I had to take
five kimonos over to Yuri's place.

483
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,956
Five?

484
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,960
Her business must be booming.

485
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,531
Care to buy any yourself?

486
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,693
I just finished paying
for my last one.

487
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,363
Pay whenever you can.
I trust you.

488
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,872
Men are so strange.
You always rush off afterwards.

489
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,151
It's bad manners,
especially the first time.

490
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,464
Can't you stay another hour?

491
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,103
Don't get lipstick on me.

492
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,233
You're like a politician.

493
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,472
You don't keep your word.

494
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,274
"The girls in my care

495
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,883
are precious goods
not to be touched."

496
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:25,719
That only applies
to women like Mama.

497
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,517
Oh, that's nice!

498
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,526
Fooling around with me
while going on about her.

499
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:39,230
There aren't many
like her in the Ginza.

500
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,266
Oh, I see.

501
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,000
What?

502
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:51,178
You did to me
what you couldn't do to her.

503
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:55,450
Nonsense.
Hurry and get ready.

504
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,351
Hand it over.

505
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,015
- What?
- The money.

506
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,420
You said you liked me.

507
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:07,928
I'm a pro.
I charge the men I like too.

508
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:13,528
It pays better than a normal job,

509
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,764
but I have to spend
so much on myself.

510
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,566
It's a vicious circle.

511
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,870
It makes no sense.

512
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,446
The owner takes it all anyway.

513
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,915
How old are you?

514
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,987
Don't ask. Old enough.

515
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,422
Thirty?

516
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,654
That's the turning point
in a woman's life.

517
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:43,128
The time to decide
whether to marry

518
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,700
or open your own bar.

519
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,066
Tell me, would you like
your own place?

520
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,139
You're joking.

521
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,816
I'll consider it,
if that's what you want.

522
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,313
I couldn't.

523
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:07,048
Yes, you could.
You could make it work.

524
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,187
How much would it take?
Give me a figure.

525
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,958
Even tiny bars in the Ginza
cost over a million.

526
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,865
Then it's no problem.

527
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:44,126
Some money I lent out
came back before it was due.

528
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,795
An honest fellow.

529
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,693
See? In cash.

530
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,602
Just a little windfall.

531
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:57,331
My wife will grab it
if I take it home.

532
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:02,542
And the banks only pay 6%.

533
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,973
If you're serious
about setting up shop, take it.

534
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:10,847
You'd lend it to me?

535
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,483
Well...

536
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,024
maybe even give it to you.

537
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:21,096
I come to Tokyo
several times a month.

538
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,702
It's a waste staying all alone
in a big room like this.

539
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,064
Maybe we could...

540
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,703
reach an understanding.

541
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,180
I don't want to force you
into anything.

542
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,875
Think it over.

543
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:49,315
Ask yourself if you want
to spend your life working for others.

544
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,234
Mama...

545
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,168
come closer.

546
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,804
Will you dine now?

547
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,778
No, thank you.
I'm just leaving.

548
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,878
I should be going.

549
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,984
I'll have an answer
next time I see you.

550
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,419
Hello?

551
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,786
Komatsu?

552
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,554
I'd like your advice.

553
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,292
It's not a bad proposition.

554
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,727
You approve?

555
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,208
That's irrelevant.

556
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,375
So you'll finally get
a place of your own.

557
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:51,983
You were a cashier
when I recruited you five years ago.

558
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,719
Time flies.

559
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:01,321
Now it's either marriage
or my own bar.

560
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,861
No respectable man
would marry me now.

561
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,197
I've made up my mind.

562
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,075
So you're giving in
to the old man

563
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,437
after holding out for five years.

564
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,476
What's so funny?

565
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:24,044
If I was going
to do it that way,

566
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,450
there are better men
than Mr. Goda.

567
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:31,217
I'll solicit subscriptions.

568
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,832
If ten men put up 100,000 yen each,
that would make a million.

569
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:39,434
I'll deduct their drinks
from what I owe them.

570
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:43,136
Now I approve!
Being a kept woman is stupid.

571
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,535
I'll chip in too.

572
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,608
You will? Thanks.

573
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:51,141
But I don't want to burden you.

574
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:55,444
Mr. Sonoda, Mr. Ito,
and Mr. Matsubara -

575
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,213
they're good
for 200,000 yen each.

576
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:02,381
That's 600,000.
The rest are small spenders.

577
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:07,925
But Fujisaki's a banker.
He could put up 200,000.

578
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,895
No, not him.

579
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,001
Why not?

580
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,228
No special reason.

581
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,700
You feel awkward asking him?

582
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,299
Something like that.

583
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,037
I know a good bar for sale.

584
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,375
- Where?
- Shall I show you?

585
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:27,676
Please.

586
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,848
THE CONGA BAR

587
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,960
The down payment is cheap.

588
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,689
Just one drawback:
You share the restroom

589
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,867
with the sushi place downstairs.

590
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:50,372
No pressure, but I've got
two other interested parties.

591
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,635
- We'll talk it over.
- I'll be eating downstairs.

592
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,917
Well?

593
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,353
It needs some fixing up,

594
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,148
but it's a good place to start.

595
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,518
I'll be your bartender.

596
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:12,753
- You're too expensive.
- Not at first.

597
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,736
But sharing the restroom
with a cheap sushi place -

598
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,167
would my customers come?

599
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,334
They'll come to see you.

600
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,341
Let's do a test run.

601
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,537
Order something.

602
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,251
A dry martini?
Coming right up.

603
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:49,255
Komatsu, your secret's out.

604
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,803
The lipstick on your shirt.

605
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,205
Lipstick?

606
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:04,470
Can't avoid an occasional smudge
with so many women around.

607
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,812
So what do you say?

608
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,418
Well...

609
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,131
We can't quite decide.

610
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,960
I've got nicer places.

611
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,840
What a surprise.

612
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,742
Long time no see.

613
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:40,307
I'd like to talk to you.
How about some tea?

614
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,991
Are you still angry at me?

615
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,596
Angry at you?
About what?

616
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:03,636
I want to apologize
for taking your customers.

617
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,571
I'm sorry.

618
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:10,603
It was the only way
to keep my place going.

619
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,406
Don't worry about it.

620
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,681
Minobe still comes?

621
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,217
Yes.

622
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:32,724
Maybe it's this light,
but you look thinner.

623
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:38,842
Just between us, I'm deep in debt.
It's taking its toll.

624
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,207
You must be joking.

625
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:45,940
I heard you bought
five kimonos for Christmas.

626
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,977
I don't have them anymore.

627
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:52,578
I bought them on credit,
then pawned them for cash. Clever, huh?

628
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,651
Isn't that risky?

629
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,862
I sold my car
and put away my golf clubs.

630
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:06,466
I borrowed so much to get started
that now I'm in a pinch.

631
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:11,404
Don't laugh.
What'll you do?

632
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,906
I've decided to die.

633
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,975
Isn't that a great idea?

634
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,682
They say sleeping pills
work quite well.

635
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:22,847
Yuri!

636
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,721
Just kidding.
It'll be a staged suicide.

637
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,460
I won't actually die.

638
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:34,597
I'll just fake it
to hold off creditors.

639
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,932
Shocked?

640
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:43,130
Not shocked. Impressed.

641
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,471
I thought,
with your place doing so well,

642
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:50,340
your view of the world
might be a little too rosy.

643
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:54,509
But you've tasted struggle too.
I respect that.

644
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,747
You're embarrassing me.

645
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,483
What a strange conversation.

646
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,390
Whatever happens,
don't give up.

647
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,895
By the way,
I'm going to open my own bar.

648
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,265
Really? That's wonderful!

649
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,493
Let's drink to that.

650
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:21,638
<i>Women working in the Ginza</i>
<i>fought desperately for survival.</i>

651
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,615
<i>It was a battle</i>
<i>I couldn't afford to lose.</i>

652
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:36,059
<i>On my days off, I took my pledge book</i>
<i>from one company to the next.</i>

653
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:41,154
<i>Some men promised</i>
<i>more than I expected,</i>

654
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,889
<i>some less.</i>

655
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:56,441
<i>But I didn't want to discuss money</i>
<i>with the man I really cared about.</i>

656
00:46:57,714 --> 00:47:00,615
A pledge book?
Well, well.

657
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,177
Your money will be repaid
little by little

658
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,379
in the form of your bar tab.

659
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,856
So we have to come drink
to get repaid? Smart idea.

660
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,825
I'm not trying to coerce anyone.

661
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,496
Joking aside,

662
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,500
I'd like to help,
especially since it's you,

663
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:25,708
but a bank can't lend 200,000
without collateral.

664
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:34,449
However, I can put up
30,000 out of my own pocket.

665
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:39,520
I may be branch manager,
but it's other people's money.

666
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,825
May I speak to you, sir?

667
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,501
Excuse me.

668
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:58,332
<i>I shouldn't have come.</i>

669
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,749
Collecting on bills?

670
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,678
Depressed?

671
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,516
I don't feel down.

672
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,957
My client didn't pay,
but at least I ran into you.

673
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,423
How about some tea?

674
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,700
What a nice fragrance.

675
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,273
What's your perfume?

676
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,437
Black Narcissus.

677
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,112
Must cost a lot.

678
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,544
It's stronger here
than at the bar.

679
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,876
Really?

680
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:45,819
So you're opening
your own place?

681
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,984
Has everyone contributed?

682
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:52,359
Nothing but promises so far.

683
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,361
I'm counting on you too.

684
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,868
You're putting me in a spot.

685
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,427
Why?

686
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:03,999
Well...

687
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,936
No, I'd better not.

688
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,044
Come on. Tell me.

689
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,678
All right.

690
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,909
A bar is no place for you.

691
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:21,249
I'd be happier
seeing you marry a good man.

692
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,924
You're the first to say that.

693
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,858
Everyone else encouraged me.

694
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:34,836
It's not the money.

695
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:40,400
But I always feel sorry
seeing you with drunks.

696
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,081
I don't know how you got
into this line of work,

697
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,714
but you belong
in a nice home.

698
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,586
Don't be offended.
It's just my opinion.

699
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:02,125
Put me down for 100,000 yen.

700
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,431
Christmas time again.

701
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,165
How depressing.

702
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:12,240
I have to buy new clothes,
sell tickets.

703
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,403
Well, well.
Long time no see.

704
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,913
Kiyomi! How are you?

705
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,582
I'm fine,

706
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:26,051
but the Lilac is going under.

707
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,317
Did you hear?
Yuri did a terrible thing.

708
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:33,728
I know.

709
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,490
You do?
She committed suicide!

710
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,329
No, she was just faking.

711
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:44,262
Can she fake being dead?

712
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:45,736
Dead?

713
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:49,935
Yes. I just got back
from paying my respects.

714
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:57,180
She put sleeping pills
in brandy.

715
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:02,120
Not too many,
but with that much alcohol...

716
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:21,744
I'm sorry she was
so much trouble to you.

717
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,810
Not at all.

718
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,813
I just came
to offer my condolences.

719
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:32,277
I only sold her
a slip and some panties.

720
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,720
You can pay me in due course.

721
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,158
I'll discuss it
with my relatives.

722
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,895
If I'm not paid soon,
I'll be fired.

723
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,470
We'll do what we can.

724
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,462
Please.

725
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,006
I'm very sorry.

726
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:08,047
I should have stopped her.

727
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:12,922
No, it was just her bad luck.

728
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,490
One way or another,

729
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,931
it would have come to this.

730
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,004
Forgive me for saying so,

731
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:26,903
but I told her from the start
not to work as a hostess.

732
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:32,772
Besides, she was too young
to own her own place.

733
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:39,485
Even a man who works his whole life
can't be sure of success.

734
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:44,918
How much harder
for a woman on her own.

735
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:51,630
Stretch yourself too far
and you're bound to fail.

736
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,868
<i>Excuse me.</i>

737
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:04,580
I've come on behalf
of Mr. Minobe.

738
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,886
I'm Yuri's mother.

739
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:15,580
I apologize for all the trouble
she caused you.

740
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,289
I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

741
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,226
It's very difficult
to have to say this,

742
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,134
but selling the bar only covers

743
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:35,073
part of the 1.5 million
that Yuri owed Mr. Minobe.

744
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:40,807
He requests that you pay
the remaining 300,000 yen.

745
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:47,149
I have the papers with me.
We need your seal.

746
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:51,219
Must I do it today?

747
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,091
Her funeral's not even over yet!

748
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:59,458
I'm merely
Mr. Minobe's employee.

749
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:04,463
Why do you think she died?

750
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:07,341
You kept pressing her for money.

751
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:10,513
She thought a suicide attempt
could hold you off.

752
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:14,276
But instead...

753
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,509
she really died!

754
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,857
What do you need
200,000 yen for?

755
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,397
Never mind that.
Can you get it?

756
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,298
Ask the owner.
I can make a lot on the deal.

757
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,236
It's a manager's duty to help.

758
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,475
If you get the money,

759
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,875
we can go
to the hot springs together.

760
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,682
Forget it.

761
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:52,210
You're in love with Mama,
aren't you?

762
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:06,791
I don't normally tell
strangers' fortunes,

763
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,972
but since you know
the lingerie shop owner...

764
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:15,301
I see the word <i>sake</i>
in the back of your mind.

765
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,709
Is there some connection
with your work?

766
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:23,077
Yes. I work in a bar.

767
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,115
That explains it.
What do you want to know?

768
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,919
It's about starting
a bar of my own.

769
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,566
Pick a card.

770
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,276
Not for a couple of years.

771
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:05,159
You'd be rowing a boat

772
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,762
against the current.

773
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:12,924
Time solves everything.
Wait patiently.

774
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:18,401
You'll soon receive
a marriage proposal.

775
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,273
A proposal?

776
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,713
<i>I came to work</i>
<i>and forgot about everything.</i>

777
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:54,338
Welcome.

778
00:56:54,544 --> 00:56:56,671
Don't you have
the wrong place?

779
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,616
You're terrible, hiding out here
and not even calling me.

780
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:07,813
This is Mr. Horiuchi.
He's with Asahi Steel.

781
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,720
- Pleased to meet you.
- My pleasure.

782
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:15,898
Even more beautiful
than I was told.

783
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:21,670
He's a big shot in steel.
I thought you two should meet.

784
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:25,001
I'm indebted to him.

785
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,576
I see.

786
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:31,076
You'd better be careful.
He's no good.

787
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,715
Don't go telling him the truth.

788
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,508
Poor Yuri.

789
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,780
Yes. She should have
told me about her debts.

790
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,891
It was only a million or so.
I could have helped.

791
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,592
You sold her place.

792
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:52,294
Squeezing her mother for 300,000!
That should be your condolence gift!

793
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,561
What's your problem?

794
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,409
Tomoko, get me a drink.
Straight.

795
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:07,742
Don't worry.
I'll pay for it.

796
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,010
You really can't hold your liquor!

797
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,029
Mama, the manager
wants to see you.

798
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:30,633
What?

799
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,004
Don't be so nasty
to Mr. Minobe.

800
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:38,745
You want me to flatter him?
Forget it.

801
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,779
Customers pay for a good -

802
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,849
I said forget it!

803
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,988
I quit the Lilac
because of him.

804
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,285
Who is he anyway?

805
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:58,229
He drives Yuri to desperation, then
comes here like nothing's happened.

806
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:00,834
I hate him!
He makes me sick!

807
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,163
Not tonight!

808
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,900
I can still smell the incense
from Yuri's funeral.

809
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:13,647
Just being next to him
is an insult to her memory!

810
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:18,583
There are limits,
even in business!

811
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,284
Stop being so emotional.

812
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,290
This is a bar.
People pay to have a good time.

813
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,522
So what?

814
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,328
Listen to me!

815
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:36,133
You get paid
to show men a good time.

816
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,167
If you don't like it,
take off that kimono

817
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,366
and work in an office

818
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,411
and starve!

819
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,081
Shut up!

820
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,522
Komatsu, Mama's
throwing up blood!

821
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,129
Blood?

822
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,874
Mama, are you all right?

823
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,478
Call a doctor!
Get a cab!

824
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,287
Sorry to bother you.

825
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,525
<i>It was a small ulcer.</i>

826
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,794
<i>Four weeks passed.</i>

827
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:44,133
<i>I spent both Christmas</i>
<i>and New Year's</i>

828
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,898
<i>in bed,</i>

829
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:49,078
<i>and the following week as well.</i>

830
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,622
Excuse me.

831
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,587
Dad.

832
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,429
May I ask your name?

833
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,966
So good of you to come.

834
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:17,070
I should have come sooner.

835
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,634
But the holidays were so busy

836
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,936
with the bar
and the place in Akasaka.

837
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,171
I'm sorry I caused you
such trouble.

838
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:29,374
I asked Komatsu about you.
You look well.

839
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,580
Thank you.

840
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,249
It's not serious.

841
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:37,315
I see.

842
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:43,098
I came across
some turtle soup.

843
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,529
I thought it might do you good.

844
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:52,706
Buy some fruit with this.

845
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,308
Thank you.

846
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:58,944
This is my first time
in these parts.

847
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:04,248
You can still see traces
of the old Tokyo.

848
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:12,024
This may not suit your taste.
Unfortunately Mother is out.

849
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,957
You needn't have.

850
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:16,097
Look what she brought.

851
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:17,493
Thank you.

852
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,225
Heat this for her tonight.

853
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:25,800
Even turtle soup costs
a fortune these days.

854
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,572
Thank you for this precious gift.

855
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,151
Your brother seems nice.

856
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:38,411
Yes, almost too nice.

857
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:40,816
Is that his son downstairs?

858
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,491
Yes. He had polio.

859
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:46,685
Really?
He has such a cute face.

860
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,157
Don't go far.

861
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,370
He's starting school this year.

862
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:02,977
There's an operation
that could help him, but...

863
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,380
It must be hard on you too.

864
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:13,188
What about your apartment?
- Junko's looking after it.

865
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:19,351
Don't worry about the bar.

866
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,860
Your health's more important.

867
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,901
Well, I should be going.

868
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:33,040
Taxes are coming due.
Could you do some collecting?

869
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:38,841
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to.

870
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,554
Ah, it's you!

871
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:58,359
I'm not supposed to let anyone in,
but you're all right.

872
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,701
Nice place.

873
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,703
The rent must be high.

874
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:10,742
Is that a present?

875
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,943
Thanks.

876
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:20,818
So this is her bedroom.

877
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,956
It's still warm.

878
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:34,293
Put that down!

879
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:40,366
- Is Mama out?
- She's in the hospital.

880
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:44,808
And I came all this way.
Which hospital?

881
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,881
- I don't know.
- Don't be ridiculous.

882
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,575
She didn't tell me.

883
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:55,120
Why not?
Is she trying to hide something?

884
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:59,021
She's not that type.
There's nobody but you.

885
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,026
The nerve!
Don't mock your elders.

886
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,931
What are you doing here?
- Watching the place.

887
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:10,862
This is a waste of time.
I'm going.

888
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,200
Don't be so gruff.

889
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,970
You can have some tea
even if she isn't here.

890
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,083
Don't be naughty

891
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,623
or Mama will scold you.

892
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,061
Tea's ready.

893
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,231
What were you doing?

894
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,705
Checking to see
if Mama has a lover.

895
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,036
Oh, you!

896
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:53,513
You call this tea?
Tastes like medicine.

897
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,510
You'd be hopeless as a bride.

898
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,687
I don't plan to get married.

899
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:02,517
- You want to stay single?
- You're so slow. I'm disappointed.

900
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,590
What do you mean, slow?

901
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,126
I mean dumb.

902
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,763
You're the dumb one.

903
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:13,231
I'm going to have
my own bar someday.

904
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,533
That's my dream.

905
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,096
Dreams are nice,

906
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,332
but first take a long look
in the mirror.

907
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,135
That's rude!

908
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:26,509
Speaking of which,
Mama never replied to my offer.

909
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:29,651
Did she say anything to you?
- No.

910
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,914
Listen...

911
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,785
What are you doing?

912
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:41,054
I want my own bar.

913
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:50,428
I feel my youth
fading by the day.

914
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,832
Sick people always say that.

915
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:59,808
Maybe I should go to the beauty salon.
It's been so long.

916
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,384
Want a massage?

917
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,019
That's all right.

918
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,418
I don't have much to do.
Lie down.

919
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,693
I hate to impose.

920
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:18,832
Here?

921
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,164
How's that?

922
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:29,041
I used to give my boss massages
when we went on business trips.

923
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,708
Brother...

924
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:36,016
were you this kind
to your wife?

925
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,854
Of course.
She was my wife.

926
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:45,722
That's why she left you...
and her own son.

927
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,358
I'm home.

928
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:57,168
Welcome back.

929
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,864
The owner came by to see me.

930
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,107
Really?

931
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,077
She gave me this.

932
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,905
You take it.

933
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,708
You sure?

934
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,180
Thanks a lot.

935
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,081
How did it go?

936
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:14,256
Let me smoke first.

937
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:17,654
Don't smoke the butts.
Take these.

938
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,393
Thanks.

939
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:28,063
Life now really makes me
long for the old days.

940
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:34,704
Those were good times.
Your father had the fish market.

941
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,674
We sent you
to a good school.

942
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,405
What did my sister-in-law say?

943
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:45,219
That she'd never return
to a family like this.

944
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,484
That's how couples
are these days.

945
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,521
You don't have to run off.

946
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:55,052
Emiko asked about you.

947
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:58,700
"How's his job
as an insurance salesman?"

948
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:03,501
You've wound up like this
because you're too nice!

949
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:08,041
You go to court again
next week, right?

950
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,578
I ran into your lawyer
at the bus stop.

951
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,941
Why didn't you say anything?

952
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,517
I've troubled you enough.

953
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:19,417
It's a little late for that now.

954
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:23,058
Why'd you affix your seal

955
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,750
to a receipt
you knew nothing about?

956
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,929
Did you have to do
everything your boss said?

957
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:33,193
That's right! I'm too nice!
I'm just a fool!

958
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,808
They were selling
these sweet bean cakes.

959
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:48,347
They're hard to find.
Have one.

960
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,643
No, thanks.

961
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,513
They're good.

962
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,449
I said no.

963
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:58,651
Fine. I won't force you,
but I got them just for you.

964
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:02,661
I guess you only like
fancy things these days.

965
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,631
It's not that.
I'm just not hungry.

966
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:08,894
Fine.

967
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:12,164
But you really can't afford
to be so extravagant.

968
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:15,800
What do you mean,
extravagant?

969
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,602
Aren't you?

970
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:22,910
You keep a fancy apartment
instead of living at home.

971
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,785
That's not an extravagance.

972
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,549
Then what is it?
Tell me!

973
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:38,489
Customers come to the Ginza
for a taste of luxury.

974
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:42,895
Satisfying that craving
is what we're paid for.

975
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:48,273
Apartments beyond our means,
taxis, expensive perfumes -

976
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,945
it all serves that purpose.

977
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,841
Men wouldn't be interested

978
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:57,780
if they knew I lived
in a place like this.

979
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:02,048
Somehow it would show,
no matter what I did.

980
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,786
Isn't it a shame
you're stuck with us?

981
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:09,556
Why even come home?
Go to some expensive hospital.

982
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:11,859
Mother.

983
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,029
Isn't it the truth?

984
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:17,205
That would suit
your silk kimono better!

985
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:21,274
Mother, how many times
must I tell you?

986
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:23,342
Kimonos aren't a luxury for me!

987
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:25,911
I know - it's business!

988
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,175
That's right! Looking good
means good customers.

989
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:32,183
In the Ginza,
appearance is everything.

990
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,852
You wouldn't understand.

991
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:38,053
I'm actually quite frugal.

992
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:43,361
Flashy kimonos
would get more attention,

993
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,292
but I can't wear them
in the daytime,

994
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:50,302
so I buy plain ones instead.

995
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:52,736
You have no right
to call me extravagant!

996
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:55,466
I said I understood!

997
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:58,044
Then stop saying it!

998
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,683
Who'd ever want
to work in a bar?

999
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:06,488
Drinking till I'm sick,
being a plaything for men.

1000
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:12,854
I haven't enjoyed a single day
since I started.

1001
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:19,692
Even lying here, thoughts of bills
torment my dreams.

1002
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:21,926
I'm miserable!

1003
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:28,642
But how else could I send you
20,000 a month?

1004
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:32,143
If you can find a better job,
tell me and I'll quit!

1005
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:36,648
Go ahead and insult me!
I'm a burden on you!

1006
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,479
Just leave us!

1007
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:40,548
Stop it!

1008
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,815
Just go downstairs!

1009
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,229
It's all my fault.

1010
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:57,803
Keiko doesn't have to pay
for the lawyer.

1011
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,566
I'll just go to prison.

1012
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,905
Don't say that.

1013
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:07,546
I'll ask again
when she's in a better mood.

1014
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,589
Take this.

1015
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,760
That's all right.

1016
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:22,564
Don't tell her.

1017
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,690
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1018
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,999
My name is Sekine.

1019
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,102
Mr. Sekine?

1020
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:39,838
No, I'd be ashamed
if he saw me here.

1021
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,107
Tell him I have a fever.

1022
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,710
How can I do that?

1023
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,178
Please just get rid of him!

1024
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,650
I see. That's too bad.

1025
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:56,524
I just had business nearby
and wondered how she was.

1026
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,068
I'm sorry
she's not being more polite.

1027
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,863
It's all right.
Please give her this.

1028
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,931
It must be hard on you,

1029
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:08,575
but please
take good care of her.

1030
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,310
What a kind man.

1031
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:24,224
How'd he find out I was here?

1032
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:27,418
What does it matter?

1033
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:31,692
Fat people are usually nice.

1034
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,233
His wife is certainly lucky.

1035
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,568
He's not married.

1036
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,509
You don't say.

1037
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:46,747
Doesn't he remind you
of Yasuo?

1038
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:53,219
He was such a kind son-in-law.

1039
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:58,855
I'm going back to work next week.

1040
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:02,188
But you're not -

1041
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:05,231
I have to.

1042
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,397
That's why the owner came by.

1043
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,170
I see.

1044
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:14,809
Would you talk
to your brother's lawyer first?

1045
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:24,175
Money will settle it.
Help him out.

1046
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:25,876
No!

1047
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,887
I have no money.

1048
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:34,824
LAW OFFICES

1049
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:40,833
<i>Despite what I'd said,</i>
<i>I couldn't let my brother go to jail.</i>

1050
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:00,383
<i>I'd only been away</i>
<i>from the bar a month,</i>

1051
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:03,922
<i>but I couldn't get used</i>
<i>to being back.</i>

1052
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,354
<i>Maybe because</i>
<i>Junko and Tomoko were away.</i>

1053
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,195
Whiskey on the rocks.

1054
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:16,827
Without any water?

1055
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,269
Same thing last night too.

1056
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:29,239
Mama, do you still feel worn out?

1057
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,351
A little.

1058
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:34,681
Everyone's dressed so nicely.

1059
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,653
All under 10,000 yen.

1060
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:39,554
You're kidding!
That cheap?

1061
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,627
It's true.

1062
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,458
Miss Kiyomi sold them
to the girls before Christmas.

1063
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:53,801
She bought the clothes
Miss Yuri had pawned,

1064
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,739
then sold them to the girls here.

1065
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:59,243
She must have made 300,000.

1066
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,713
Very smart.

1067
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:06,051
Smarter if she'd saved it.

1068
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:11,385
She spent it all on that guy
who sells black-market whiskey.

1069
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:20,164
Mr. Komatsu's
in Akasaka right now.

1070
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:22,564
I'm here as a customer tonight.

1071
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,898
White Horse. A double.

1072
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:31,646
- It's been a long time.
- It has.

1073
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:34,816
That's no tone
to use with a customer.

1074
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:37,451
I quit the black market.

1075
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,247
Next time
it would have been jail.

1076
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:44,284
Don't be so stuck up.

1077
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,791
I know you're Ionely.

1078
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,486
I've been thinking about it:

1079
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:54,759
Give me a chance just once.
You won't regret it.

1080
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,766
I'm a paying customer!

1081
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,551
Oh, hello.

1082
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:20,557
- Leaving?
- I was, but come up.

1083
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:23,424
No, I'll drive you home.

1084
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,964
You will? All right.

1085
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:32,570
I'm glad to see you're better.

1086
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:35,167
Thank you for calling on me.

1087
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,806
You drive well.

1088
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:41,812
I'm just a safe driver.
I don't drink.

1089
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:45,414
Bars can't be much fun then.

1090
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,918
I'm looking for a mistress.

1091
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:50,148
Always joking.

1092
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,724
I wouldn't date a woman

1093
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:58,525
if I weren't considering
marrying her.

1094
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,606
Thanks.

1095
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,017
What?

1096
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:26,258
Would you laugh
if I proposed to you?

1097
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:34,060
I know.
No need to answer.

1098
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,466
I just wanted to say it once.

1099
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:45,476
Pretend I never said it.
Bye.

1100
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:30,949
Oh, it's you.
What is it?

1101
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,761
I waited here.
Better than going to your bar.

1102
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:38,465
May I come in?
- Don't be so formal.

1103
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:45,872
You must be tired.

1104
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:49,009
What do you want?
Out with it.

1105
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:51,611
The lawyer got me
a suspended sentence.

1106
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:55,249
It's all thanks to you.

1107
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:59,113
You needn't have come.
I already knew that.

1108
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:05,152
So what is it you want now?

1109
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:08,930
Money again?

1110
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,995
It's not for me.

1111
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,326
- Yoshio?
- Yes.

1112
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:17,470
Dr. Murata said
if he operates now,

1113
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:20,334
Yoshio will be walking
before school starts.

1114
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:22,974
Without crutches?

1115
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:28,712
Well, that'll take six months
of physical therapy.

1116
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,977
But he can't go
to school as he is.

1117
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:40,924
I know you'll say no.
It's a lot of money.

1118
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:42,892
Then why come?

1119
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:44,588
I'm sorry.

1120
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:47,529
I've always been a coward.
I don't know why.

1121
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:51,104
How much will it cost?

1122
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:54,707
Never mind.
It's selfish of me.

1123
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:58,175
I just thought maybe
you could ask the owner -

1124
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,439
How much?

1125
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,412
At least 70 or 80,000.

1126
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:03,811
80,000?

1127
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:06,382
It can be in installments.

1128
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:10,922
Please help us.
I won't ask again.

1129
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:14,319
That's what you always say.

1130
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:18,730
I mean it.
I've made up my mind.

1131
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:24,531
We'll cut our ties
as brother and sister.

1132
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:29,039
I promise...
I'll never come here again.

1133
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:33,536
This is the last time.
Please help.

1134
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:36,643
For poor Yoshio's sake.

1135
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:40,048
Please, I beg you!

1136
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,624
That's right - take everything!

1137
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:47,520
All of you!
Just prey on me!

1138
01:22:49,931 --> 01:22:52,297
Enough!
I don't want to hear it!

1139
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,074
Come in.

1140
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:09,873
May I?

1141
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,315
Go home.

1142
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:17,956
Think it over.

1143
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:29,628
You sure it's all right?

1144
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:36,042
I meant to give you
something earlier, but I forgot.

1145
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:37,734
Here.

1146
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:40,510
Open it after I leave.

1147
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:42,978
Please don't go.

1148
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:45,917
Stay awhile.

1149
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:48,352
What's wrong?

1150
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,124
Nothing.

1151
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:58,098
May I open it?

1152
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:12,607
Black Narcissus.

1153
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:15,783
You mentioned you liked it.

1154
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:23,524
Mama.

1155
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:39,706
Why are you crying?

1156
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:48,773
What's wrong, Mama?

1157
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:09,369
I'll take this one.

1158
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:17,437
Buying a present for someone?

1159
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:20,910
I heard you received
a fine proposal.

1160
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:24,449
I saw the fortune-teller yesterday.
She told me.

1161
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:27,120
She's good, isn't she?

1162
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,062
Well?

1163
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:38,898
Very becoming.

1164
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,567
Look.

1165
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:45,134
I don't have the money today,

1166
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,241
but I'll pay your hospital bill soon.

1167
01:25:48,443 --> 01:25:51,412
Thank you.
That's a huge help.

1168
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:56,374
Don't talk like that.
We're not strangers anymore.

1169
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:00,015
You're right.

1170
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:04,355
I never dreamed

1171
01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:07,455
I'd become the wife
of a factory owner.

1172
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,180
Hello!

1173
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,652
You seem different today.

1174
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:38,525
Do I?

1175
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,725
Junko's waiting in back
to talk to you.

1176
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,399
What about?

1177
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,297
She's quitting.
At least she's giving notice.

1178
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:55,508
Don't be angry.

1179
01:26:56,644 --> 01:27:00,045
So you're quitting?
Why?

1180
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:05,442
I got Mr. Goda
to put up some money.

1181
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:07,587
I'm opening a bar.

1182
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:09,589
Mr. Goda?

1183
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:13,083
Is that so?

1184
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:16,386
Congratulations.
That's wonderful.

1185
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,865
What a relief!

1186
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,831
Did you find a place?

1187
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:24,300
It's above a sushi restaurant.

1188
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:28,464
We share the restroom,
but I don't mind.

1189
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:35,171
What is it?

1190
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:37,949
Nothing at all.

1191
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:40,346
Congratulations.

1192
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:24,123
Hello? This is she.

1193
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:27,428
Mr. Sekine?

1194
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,796
No, he's not here.

1195
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,401
Who's calling?

1196
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:37,076
Mrs. Sekine?

1197
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:40,480
You're really his wife?

1198
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:42,773
Yes.

1199
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:52,856
Hello? Hello?

1200
01:29:08,609 --> 01:29:11,009
It's so embarrassing.

1201
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:15,672
He may not look it, but my husband's
a hopeless womanizer.

1202
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:21,115
He lures them in
with marriage proposals.

1203
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:25,581
I can't count how often
I've had to straighten things out.

1204
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:31,827
This time he borrowed
the neighbor's car

1205
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,900
and hasn't been home
in a week.

1206
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:39,367
I'm not even jealous anymore,

1207
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:42,475
but our neighbor is angry.

1208
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:45,145
He forgot his address book,

1209
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:49,442
so I called
all the women in it.

1210
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:56,418
He's not bad at heart.
He just loves to show off.

1211
01:29:56,791 --> 01:30:02,161
He lies and then begins
to think it's all true.

1212
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:05,054
That's just how he is.

1213
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:09,464
I'm so sorry
I had to call you like that.

1214
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:16,072
A pretty woman like you -

1215
01:30:16,277 --> 01:30:18,837
you didn't fall for it, did you?

1216
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:52,470
Fill it up.

1217
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,910
Mama, are you all right?

1218
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:57,279
I'm fine!

1219
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,366
Welcome.

1220
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:28,176
Welcome.

1221
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:33,281
You look well.
I heard you were sick.

1222
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:35,784
I'm very well.

1223
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:40,994
See, it's really you that I love.

1224
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,494
Oh, my.

1225
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:46,361
Excuse me.

1226
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:51,936
Mr. Fujisaki, who's she?
Introduce us.

1227
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:53,663
You're drunk.

1228
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:56,673
Mama, come here a moment.

1229
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:04,581
Komatsu, keep an eye on her.

1230
01:32:05,486 --> 01:32:08,922
Leave me alone!
Let me go!

1231
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:10,988
What do you plan to do?

1232
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:13,950
Drink till I die.

1233
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:20,962
Who's that geisha anyway?
Acting so prim!

1234
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:23,329
I'll steal him back!

1235
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:27,439
Stop it! I hate you!

1236
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:46,424
- How's Mama?
- Mr. Fujisaki's taking her to a nightclub.

1237
01:32:46,627 --> 01:32:48,322
The geisha left.

1238
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:50,156
She can't keep drinking.

1239
01:32:50,364 --> 01:32:54,596
Her guest wants her to go.
I can't stop her.

1240
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:19,389
Mr. Fujisaki...

1241
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:23,096
I'll go anywhere
with you tonight.

1242
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:28,897
Or don't you want
a woman like me?

1243
01:33:29,403 --> 01:33:33,134
I understand.
But no more drinks.

1244
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:36,105
Mr. Fujisaki...

1245
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:42,174
I've heard you've had
a lot of women.

1246
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,745
But I love you.

1247
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:51,955
Women fall for your type.
You know that?

1248
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:55,686
Yes, I know. Let's go home.
It's after 11:00.

1249
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:58,990
You mustn't get sick again.
Let's go.

1250
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:20,750
I'm so glad you're here.

1251
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:22,980
The tax collector
is coming tomorrow.

1252
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:26,159
Bring your books over tonight.

1253
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,351
We'll fix them up.

1254
01:34:29,096 --> 01:34:30,757
I see.

1255
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:38,600
Whiskey really
knocks you off your feet.

1256
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:48,114
I'm sorry to bother you.

1257
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:49,907
Do you feel ill?

1258
01:34:50,718 --> 01:34:53,619
- No, but I'm thirsty.
- Want some water?

1259
01:34:53,821 --> 01:34:54,947
Thanks.

1260
01:34:55,156 --> 01:34:57,181
Stop thanking me.

1261
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:10,402
I drank so much.

1262
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:13,402
Did I say anything?

1263
01:35:14,008 --> 01:35:15,873
No, nothing.

1264
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:41,427
Thanks for everything.

1265
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:43,864
Good night.

1266
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:51,704
No, don't.

1267
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:54,776
I love you!
I always have!

1268
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:56,609
No, don't!

1269
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:29,208
What's wrong?

1270
01:36:31,919 --> 01:36:33,682
I had a dream.

1271
01:36:34,889 --> 01:36:37,619
I was crying.

1272
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:42,260
When I woke up,
I was really crying.

1273
01:36:42,897 --> 01:36:44,762
What was your dream?

1274
01:36:45,733 --> 01:36:48,201
It was about my late husband.

1275
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:51,830
Even when a woman's
in your arms,

1276
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:54,940
you can never tell
who she's really thinking of.

1277
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:00,844
Light me one, please.

1278
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:05,418
It was a strange dream.

1279
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:10,851
He called to say he was
returning from a business trip.

1280
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:14,027
I went to the harbor to greet him.

1281
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:19,090
Strange that
he'd be coming by ship,

1282
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,632
but that's how dreams are.

1283
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:25,668
He stood on deck,

1284
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:29,707
waving the presents
he'd bought me.

1285
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:34,280
Guess what they were.

1286
01:37:35,482 --> 01:37:39,942
Potatoes, onions, and radishes.

1287
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:51,225
We married just after the war,
when food was scarce.

1288
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:54,959
He often brought vegetables
back from his trips.

1289
01:37:56,237 --> 01:38:01,470
Seeing those vegetables
in the dream made me sad,

1290
01:38:01,909 --> 01:38:04,434
so I started crying.

1291
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,872
I see.

1292
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:11,114
Was he a kind man?

1293
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:14,346
I love you...

1294
01:38:14,822 --> 01:38:18,223
but I'd prefer a husband.

1295
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:21,688
Someone always by my side.

1296
01:38:23,197 --> 01:38:27,395
I don't want to see you
just once in a while.

1297
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:35,837
I'm happy now though.

1298
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:39,706
Really?
You don't regret it?

1299
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:43,416
No, I don't.

1300
01:38:44,451 --> 01:38:48,148
But I'm worried about one thing.

1301
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:50,016
Worried?

1302
01:38:56,764 --> 01:39:00,495
When my husband died,

1303
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:05,798
I placed my picture and a letter
in with his ashes.

1304
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:13,207
I vowed I'd never love
another man.

1305
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,346
I wrote that down

1306
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:21,283
and asked the priest
to put it in with him.

1307
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:26,822
I'm a strange woman, aren't I?

1308
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:32,999
I have to go now.

1309
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:38,235
No, stay a little longer.

1310
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,203
I can't.

1311
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:45,468
It's still early.
I'll make some coffee.

1312
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,647
That's all right.

1313
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:03,620
I meant to tell you last night,
but I couldn't.

1314
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:06,129
I'm being transferred to Osaka.

1315
01:40:07,301 --> 01:40:11,032
When was that decided?

1316
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:15,865
The end of the year.

1317
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:18,268
I leave tomorrow.

1318
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:31,113
I won't forget you.
Call me if you ever come to Osaka.

1319
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:40,364
All I can do now is help

1320
01:40:40,567 --> 01:40:43,331
when you open your own place.

1321
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:46,002
I promise you that.

1322
01:40:48,475 --> 01:40:52,036
Mr. Fujisaki...

1323
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:56,215
I really do love you.

1324
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:58,180
I love you too.

1325
01:41:01,321 --> 01:41:02,948
You do?

1326
01:41:04,758 --> 01:41:06,851
I love you...

1327
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:11,622
but I don't have the courage
to break up my home.

1328
01:41:14,301 --> 01:41:17,964
It may be selfish of me,
but it's the truth.

1329
01:41:23,277 --> 01:41:25,939
I bought this stock cheap.

1330
01:41:26,146 --> 01:41:28,671
It's worth 100,000 now.

1331
01:41:28,882 --> 01:41:30,645
Maybe it will help.

1332
01:41:39,326 --> 01:41:43,524
I meant to leave it
last night and go.

1333
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:50,034
A noble sentiment, but I was
too low to see it through.

1334
01:41:58,812 --> 01:42:03,545
I'll never forget
this brief time together.

1335
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:08,754
Take care of yourself.

1336
01:42:58,172 --> 01:43:00,106
I just saw Fujisaki.

1337
01:43:04,945 --> 01:43:08,381
Why are you crying?
Did he jilt you?

1338
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:20,187
I used to respect you.

1339
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:26,224
I was amazed at how
you never gave in for five long years.

1340
01:43:27,501 --> 01:43:29,230
That illusion's gone.

1341
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:33,838
Sorry.
I'm not that good.

1342
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:39,742
Do you love him?

1343
01:43:42,516 --> 01:43:43,983
Why don't you answer?

1344
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:46,015
I don't love him or hate him.

1345
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,155
Besides, he's being
transferred to Osaka.

1346
01:43:49,356 --> 01:43:53,258
You fool! Why'd you give in
if you don't love him?

1347
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:55,860
Aren't you ashamed?

1348
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:58,964
Did you forget
your letter and picture?

1349
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:03,330
- That was just -
- Liar! I looked into it.

1350
01:44:05,606 --> 01:44:12,011
I got drunk one day
and asked the priest about it.

1351
01:44:13,146 --> 01:44:15,205
Why'd you do that?

1352
01:44:18,051 --> 01:44:19,985
Why?

1353
01:44:21,188 --> 01:44:23,315
Don't pretend you don't know.

1354
01:44:23,824 --> 01:44:26,156
You know I love you.

1355
01:44:31,064 --> 01:44:36,001
But I never said a word.
I kept it locked up inside.

1356
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:42,007
It became so unbearable
I even seduced one of our girls.

1357
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:44,907
Some manager!

1358
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:50,007
Last December it got
so I couldn't take it anymore.

1359
01:44:50,217 --> 01:44:52,378
I went to the temple
and checked.

1360
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:58,524
It turned out to be true,
so I vowed never to touch you,

1361
01:44:58,725 --> 01:45:01,250
or let anyone else either!

1362
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:05,397
But now you've turned
into a consummate pro!

1363
01:45:06,767 --> 01:45:09,736
Sorry to disappoint you.

1364
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:13,763
But who told me
to act like a pro?

1365
01:45:14,107 --> 01:45:16,940
Who told me to flatter Minobe?

1366
01:45:17,577 --> 01:45:24,642
You told me never to go halfway,
to be a real pro!

1367
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:30,446
Well, now I'm a pro,
and the customer's happy.

1368
01:45:30,657 --> 01:45:32,784
What's wrong with that?

1369
01:45:42,769 --> 01:45:44,634
No!

1370
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:46,804
I love you!

1371
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:48,736
Let me go!

1372
01:45:50,644 --> 01:45:53,306
Marry me.
I'm begging you.

1373
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:55,538
Let's open our own bar.

1374
01:45:56,483 --> 01:45:59,919
Get out or I'll scream.

1375
01:46:01,388 --> 01:46:03,583
You hate me that much?

1376
01:46:04,891 --> 01:46:07,155
I don't hate you or love you.

1377
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:10,819
That kind of marriage
would never work.

1378
01:46:11,298 --> 01:46:14,734
We know each other too well.

1379
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:20,200
Please just go.

1380
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:23,098
Go!

1381
01:46:25,746 --> 01:46:29,045
Please let me be alone.

1382
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:39,224
You really love Fujisaki,
don't you?

1383
01:46:41,962 --> 01:46:43,623
I understand.

1384
01:46:45,599 --> 01:46:47,931
I'll never bother you again.

1385
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:33,671
You'd be a great help,

1386
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:37,509
but I could never
afford your salary.

1387
01:47:39,152 --> 01:47:40,813
I see.

1388
01:47:41,888 --> 01:47:44,550
Why'd you quit the Carton?

1389
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:46,589
Have a fight with Mama?

1390
01:47:49,729 --> 01:47:52,254
I'm tired of that place.

1391
01:47:54,167 --> 01:47:56,795
I may go back to the Club 8.

1392
01:47:58,405 --> 01:48:01,806
I'll help out when you're busy.
- Thanks.

1393
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:05,177
Good-bye.

1394
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,934
Mrs. Fujisaki?

1395
01:48:29,135 --> 01:48:33,265
I'm Keiko from the Carton Bar,
and a customer of the bank.

1396
01:48:35,342 --> 01:48:38,869
You've been very kind
to my husband.

1397
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:40,603
Not at all.

1398
01:48:40,814 --> 01:48:43,214
Congratulations on his promotion.

1399
01:48:43,416 --> 01:48:44,940
Thank you.

1400
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:50,446
I borrowed this
from your husband.

1401
01:48:50,657 --> 01:48:53,285
I'd like to return it.

1402
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:56,822
Is that all right?

1403
01:49:01,735 --> 01:49:04,727
If I need it again,
I'll borrow it directly from you.

1404
01:49:04,938 --> 01:49:06,371
I see.

1405
01:49:07,274 --> 01:49:10,710
Here's a little something
for the children.

1406
01:49:11,778 --> 01:49:12,802
Dear...

1407
01:49:14,114 --> 01:49:15,672
Thanks.

1408
01:49:17,984 --> 01:49:20,851
Please take good care
of yourselves.

1409
01:49:54,888 --> 01:49:56,355
She's beautiful.

1410
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:04,161
Not at all like a bar hostess.

1411
01:50:06,232 --> 01:50:09,963
Mommy, what is this?
Can we open it?

1412
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:11,967
Later.

1413
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:31,320
<i>It had been a bleak ordeal,</i>
<i>like a harsh winter.</i>

1414
01:50:31,524 --> 01:50:35,517
<i>But the trees that line the streets</i>
<i>can sprout new buds</i>

1415
01:50:35,729 --> 01:50:38,197
<i>no matter how cold the wind.</i>

1416
01:50:39,532 --> 01:50:43,332
<i>I too must be just as strong</i>

1417
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:47,333
<i>as the winds</i>
<i>that gust around me.</i>

1418
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:03,122
Ah! Welcome!

1419
01:51:03,757 --> 01:51:08,421
It's been so long!
Welcome!

1420
01:51:13,767 --> 01:51:17,669
THE END
