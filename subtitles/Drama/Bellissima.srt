1
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:25,184
Attention, please.
To all our dear and loyal listeners.

2
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:30,310
To mothers, fathers and relatives –
Stella Film announces a contest.

3
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:34,475
They're looking for a girl
between six and eight years of age.

4
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:36,871
A pretty Italian girl.

5
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:39,464
Take your daughters
to Stella Film offices...

6
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,474
in Cinecittà
Via Tuscolana, km 9.

7
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:45,110
It could be your and her lucky day.

8
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:16,354
Only girls between six
and eight years of age...

9
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:19,468
can enter the theatre
quietly and calmly...

10
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:22,633
to be seen by Blasetti, the director.

11
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:25,224
Keep quiet and stay calm!

12
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:36,552
Do you understand?

13
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:52,867
Hurry! Hurry!

14
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:08,389
- I've lost my daughter.
- She lost her daughter. Vito!

15
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:13,470
Where is she gone?

16
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:15,951
- What's her name?
- Maria Cecconi.

17
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:27,110
Little Maria Cecconi!

18
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:38,910
Quiet! Quiet, please.
There.

19
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:41,630
Politeness goes a long way.

20
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:45,795
In other words, we'll be able
to screen test your little girls...

21
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:49,545
if you keep calm and quiet.
Right? Good.

22
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,395
- Shall we start, Taparelli?
- Yes, we're ready.

23
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:55,110
- Glori, send the first child.
- The first child!

24
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:56,954
The first child, come on.

25
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:58,794
What can you do?

26
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:01,555
I can imitate Betty Gable.

27
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:04,873
That's great. Let's see.

28
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:18,505
Well done, you're really good.

29
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:20,991
- You're starting early. How old are you?
- 11.

30
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:24,791
Good. Give her a number.
Next one, please.

31
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,032
Quiet, over there.

32
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,466
Come on. Keep that child quiet.

33
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:32,712
- What can you do?
- "Arrivano i Nostri".

34
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,031
Good.
Start singing "Arrivano i Nostri".

35
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:39,195
Good.

36
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:42,989
Very good.

37
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:45,149
Yes, louder.

38
00:07:47,235 --> 00:07:50,387
Very good.
Chiari, give her a number.

39
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:53,155
- Next!
- Tell them to be quiet over there.

40
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:00,591
You have a Chinese hat, good.
Quiet!

41
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:04,072
I've spent hours looking for you.

42
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:06,266
How could I go home without you?

43
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:08,114
Look at the state of you.

44
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:12,229
Just look at that. Get up now.
You deserve to be smacked!

45
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:15,675
Why are you crying?
Look at the state of you.

46
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:20,790
Damn it! You drive me mad. They even
called you over the megaphone.

47
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:24,750
- Mummy!
- "Mummy" what?

48
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:33,630
What did she do wrong?

49
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:36,475
What did she do?
She nearly gave me a heart attack

50
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:39,713
I've been looking for her
all over Cinecittà.

51
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:42,634
- They won't let us in now.
- Are you here for the contest?

52
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,906
Yes, we are.
But look at the state of her now.

53
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:47,231
She looks worse for wear.
Come here.

54
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:49,915
If I were you, I'd leave her like that.

55
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,833
All dirty? Yeah, right.

56
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:55,312
They're much cuter like this,
all grubby and untidy.

57
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,631
Very funny.

58
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:00,748
She's got a pretty smile.
She's very photogenic.

59
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,344
And she's got beautiful eyes.
Let's see.

60
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,273
Really beautiful.

61
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:08,194
At least it's something.
Let's hope they'll pick you.

62
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,113
Gosh, I'm lost now.

63
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,033
- They're at number 5
- Number 5?

64
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:14,715
- Studio number 5
- And how do I get there?

65
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:17,475
- Calm down, I'll take you there.
- Will you?

66
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:20,952
How kind of you. Let's go.
I'll settle up with you when we get home.

67
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,627
This is the girl who got lost.

68
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:26,395
- Let the lady through here.
- If you say so

69
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:29,826
I've brought some photos of her.
Do you think it's a good idea?

70
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:33,710
Pretty. This child is really pretty.

71
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:36,873
- Well, at this age, they're all pretty.
- Yeah?

72
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,909
They're all pretty,
but I prefer their mothers.

73
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:44,386
May I give you a piece of advice?

74
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:48,907
The second audition will be harder
and these photos won't help you much.

75
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:50,674
- Are they ugly?
- A bit.

76
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:52,991
You need bigger and better ones.

77
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:56,506
Go to a professional photographer.
I can give you a name.

78
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:58,752
- That would be great.
- Tell him I sent you.

79
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,071
Alberto Annovazzi, that's my name.

80
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:04,267
The photographer is
in Via Quattro Fontane, number 14.

81
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,832
- Go and see him, he's great.
- I'll definitely go.

82
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,753
- Thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it

83
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,309
I don't know how to thank you.

84
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:14,314
- Can I go in?
- This way, it leads straight to the studio.

85
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:17,394
- I'm so lucky I met you.
- Best of luck.

86
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:20,349
- Say bye.
- Bye, and don't run off again.

87
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:22,307
- I'm holding her tight.
- Good.

88
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:23,949
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, madam.

89
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:29,309
<i>Painter, I need to talk to you</i>

90
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:33,031
<i>While you paint this altar</i>

91
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:36,546
<i>I am just a poor black man</i>

92
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:39,873
<i>And to pray God here I am</i>

93
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:44,114
<i>I know you'll be listening...</i>

94
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:47,034
Excuse me.
I should have been up there long ago

95
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:49,386
I had lost my daughter.

96
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,427
Excuse me.

97
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:55,469
- Did you find her?
- She's found her!

98
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:08,709
Good evening, Mr. Blasetti.

99
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,225
Madam, stand back.

100
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:14,393
Good, well done.

101
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,313
But she's finished singing.

102
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:22,110
Mancinelli Silvana?
Mario! Give her a number.

103
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:25,546
Okay, now the next child.

104
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,667
Next child, come on.

105
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:31,232
Madam, who are you?

106
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:35,986
The incident's over!
Go back to your seats!

107
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:39,153
- Enough!
- That's it, the incident's over.

108
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:42,154
This is the child who got lost.

109
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:44,267
- Oh, yeah.
- I lost sight of her.

110
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:47,991
This place is like a town.
She was somewhere around there.

111
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,232
- Where did you find her?
- By the pool.

112
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:52,472
Ladies, quiet please.

113
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,746
Quiet, please.

114
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,913
- Where did you find her?
- By the pool, she was fishing!

115
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:02,188
- She got dirty.
- Yes, she ruined her dress.

116
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:04,227
Cute. What's your name?

117
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,187
- Maria.
- Say your name.

118
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:11,310
- Maria.
- Very good. Maria what?

119
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:13,947
- Maria...
- "Gecconi"

120
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:17,955
- "Giacconi"?
- No, she lisps slightly.

121
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:20,271
- So, what's her real surname?
- Cecconi.

122
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:22,512
Cecconi, good.
Repeat, "Maria Cecconi".

123
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:27,073
- Maria "Gecconi"
- Oh well, it must sound right to her.

124
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:31,587
When I made the announcement
you were outside looking for your child...

125
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:36,346
but I said that the child
has to be six or seven years old.

126
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:38,990
- Not younger.
- But she's seven.

127
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:41,266
Is she? She looks a bit... small.

128
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:44,866
Really? No, it must be the dress
that makes her look short.

129
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:51,305
In all truth,
she hasn't grown much this year.

130
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,904
She'll grow more next year,
it doesn't matter.

131
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:58,393
So, what can you do?
Do you dance? Sing? What can you do?

132
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:00,507
- Venice!
- You do Venice.

133
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:03,230
Mr. Blasetti won't understand
if you say that.

134
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:05,472
- She means a poem about Venice.
- Ah, okay.

135
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:08,633
Good. You can begin reciting the poem.
Go on.

136
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,031
"Venice, to thee comes at last
the last hour.

137
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:13,272
"Martyr illustrious, in thy foe's power.

138
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:15,591
"Bread lacks, the cholera deadlier grows.

139
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:18,435
"From the lagoon bridge
the white banner blows."

140
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:22,629
Did you teach her that?
She's a star.

141
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:25,145
Not even at Christmas
did she recite it so well.

142
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,868
Just for you.

143
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,672
You know what? We need to hurry.

144
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:32,594
It's two o'clock,
and if we get to the stadium late...

145
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:35,594
it will be full
and we'll have to stand up like idiots.

146
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:39,152
- Let's hurry.
- I don't feel like going anymore.

147
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,790
What do you mean?
You're not coming to the match?

148
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:43,668
Bruno, did you hear that?

149
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:46,026
You know that I'm worried.

150
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:49,148
She left early in the morning
and took the child with her.

151
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:51,744
I'm not in the mood, Franco. Don't insist.

152
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,869
She told you she was going to give an
injection in Monteverde, at her friend's.

153
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:58,988
Why would she go all the way
to Monteverde to give shots?

154
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,515
Exactly.

155
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:03,195
It's Sunday and the tram
costs 20 lire each way...

156
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:05,511
and the child pays full fare.

157
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:08,355
- I know.
- Your wife is mad. Tell her that.

158
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:09,875
Franco, drink your coffee.

159
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:14,035
See what you've done?
This moron's always laughing.

160
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:16,386
Whatever.
Drink your coffee and shut up.

161
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:19,189
Give me a chance, it's still boiling hot.

162
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:23,594
Mum, I won't even bother about her.
She always does as she likes anyway.

163
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:28,107
- She has to respect you.
- Yeah, exactly. She has to respect you.

164
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,148
You know what? I don't think
she's gone to Monteverde.

165
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:34,586
What are you talking about?
She's taken the child with her.

166
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:37,355
That's exactly why I think
she hasn't gone there.

167
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:41,151
Let's go, guys. It's three o'clock
and we're still here discussing.

168
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:44,313
- Let's go, it's late.
- Let's go Spartaco, come on.

169
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:46,552
- Come home early.
- Give her another kiss.

170
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:49,952
Mum, you never change.
Okay, I've made a mess of myself.

171
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,475
I'll clean you up. Bye.

172
00:14:51,595 --> 00:14:53,188
Kiss my forehead.

173
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:55,750
Have fun, don't catch too much sun.

174
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,151
- Okay.
- When you see Maddalena tell her...

175
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:01,154
Yes, I'll tell her not to go away again
with the child.

176
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,585
It's two o'clock
and she still hasn't eaten.

177
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:06,355
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

178
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,194
- See you.
- Enjoy yourselves.

179
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:09,715
- It's late.
- Bye.

180
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:12,350
Hurry up.

181
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:15,195
Shut up.

182
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:19,146
Spartaco, there's your wife.

183
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,153
- And you were worried.
- There she is.

184
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:24,393
Where have you been all this time?

185
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:28,350
- Spartaco!
- Slow down. What's the rush now?

186
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:29,909
- I went there!
- Where?

187
00:15:30,035 --> 00:15:32,470
To Cinecittà, for the contest.

188
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:34,348
- Are you mad?
- Maybe.

189
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,353
- In any case, they picked her.
- Who?

190
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:38,194
Our daughter, not me. I wish!

191
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:41,228
- Don't lie, you're always telling lies.
- I'm not lying.

192
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:44,109
Don't even bother,
she always does what she wants.

193
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,546
She's all talk. Let's hurry, guys,
the match will have started.

194
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,667
Mind your own business for once.

195
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,833
- Don't use that tone with him.
- Whatever.

196
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:54,753
I'll come to watch the match too.

197
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,788
- No, you go home and feed the child.
- Your mum can feed her.

198
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,475
- No, you feed her!
- Take me to the cinema tonight.

199
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,188
Forget it. We'll talk at home.

200
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:04,272
- Let's go, Franco.
- What?

201
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,990
- Keep yakking.
- Stop it, idiot.

202
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:12,311
We're going to the cinema tonight, right?

203
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:16,349
Don't act the fool.
Just go home and feed the child.

204
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,832
How nice. Let's go, darling.
Bye, darling.

205
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:26,031
One, two, three, four.

206
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:29,273
One, two, three, four.

207
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:53,750
Mrs. Molteni!

208
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,389
What do you want?

209
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:59,907
Shout louder, I can't understand you.

210
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,027
It's all because of this damn noise.

211
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,944
They wake people up early in the
morning. What do you want then?

212
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,385
Is my mum up there?

213
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:10,427
No, she isn't here, Maria.

214
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:14,390
She's gone to Margherita's for the
injection. Let me call her for you.

215
00:17:14,515 --> 00:17:15,915
Maddalena!

216
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:20,106
- Maddalena!
- What?

217
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,830
- Maria is looking for you.
- Who?

218
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:26,027
- Your daughter is looking for you.
- What do you want, Maria?

219
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:29,432
Mum, there's a lady
who wants a coffee.

220
00:17:29,555 --> 00:17:31,035
I can't hear you!

221
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:33,033
There's a lady who wants a coffee!

222
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:36,626
Honey, don't hold me up,
I'm giving an injection. I'll be right down.

223
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,429
Be good. Thanks.

224
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:56,475
Mum said she's coming down.

225
00:17:56,595 --> 00:18:00,384
She's busy giving a lady an injection.

226
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,635
You see this egg?

227
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:34,270
God helps those
who help themselves.

228
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:44,274
- Your daughter's been calling you.
- I know, my dear.

229
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:47,069
- Is she ill?
- Not at all. She's been picked.

230
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:50,984
We're going to the photographer.
When are you going to have this baby?

231
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:55,632
What are you doing here?
Don't you have a house? What a pain!

232
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:58,953
<i>Those lovely images</i>

233
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:02,910
<i>The times that have gone by...</i>

234
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:06,870
Gisella, can you please ask your
daughter to do Maria's homework?

235
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:09,669
We're going to the photographer.
She's been picked.

236
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:12,355
She's been picked! Bye.

237
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:14,307
Good for you.

238
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:17,587
What a fanatic, she's completely mad.

239
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:27,151
Don't choke, please.

240
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:29,312
Is this the lady
who wanted a coffee?

241
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:34,590
Sorry, but I had a cramp...
in my stomach.

242
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,105
I asked the child for some coffee.

243
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:40,353
I know. We don't have that,
but you found the eggs.

244
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:43,593
- They're better.
- Yeah, they're even better.

245
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,388
By the way, who are you?

246
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:49,395
- How silly of me. You don't know me.
- Exactly.

247
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:52,235
I'm Tilde Spernanzoni.

248
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:58,473
- The actress.
- What?

249
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:00,268
The actress.

250
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:03,627
I'm not working anymore... I'm tired.

251
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:06,509
When you get to a certain age,
you must rest.

252
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:10,231
Moreover, you have
to make way for the younger generation.

253
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:11,948
I do a bit of film work.

254
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:15,307
Mum, the lady drunk an egg.

255
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,347
It doesn't matter.

256
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:21,264
Little blabbermouth.

257
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:26,026
So, is this the child that has been
selected for the second audition?

258
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:29,865
Listen, who sent you here?
Cinecittà? Stella Film? Who?

259
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,591
Somebody must have sent you here.
You can't have fallen from the sky!

260
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:37,504
Somebody I know gave me the names
of the ones who were picked.

261
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:40,588
She's very pretty.

262
00:20:40,715 --> 00:20:42,627
Give me your hand.

263
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:45,668
Let's go, good girl.

264
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:50,347
While mum prepares a nice
cup of coffee with plenty of sugar...

265
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:53,070
you are going to recite something
for me.

266
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,755
What a lovely garden!

267
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,787
Excellent. Let's go.

268
00:20:57,915 --> 00:21:01,386
Yeah, this place is like a palace!
Thank goodness we're moving.

269
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:05,270
Where are you going? I know for a fact
that lessons aren't necessary.

270
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:07,193
They like her like this.

271
00:21:07,315 --> 00:21:09,546
As long as she's bright and intelligent.

272
00:21:09,675 --> 00:21:11,667
And my daughter is very intelligent.

273
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:15,550
- Plus, we can't afford it.
- I see.

274
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:18,065
Sacrifices need to be made
for our children.

275
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:21,950
Our children come before anything else.
Let's go.

276
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:25,193
Did you come here to teach me
how to be a good mother?

277
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:28,194
You're holding us up,
we need to go to the photographer.

278
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:30,705
How do I have to tell you?

279
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,191
- Go there later.
- What do you mean, later?

280
00:21:33,315 --> 00:21:35,034
Where are you going?

281
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:38,944
Maria, recite her the poem, you know it
by heart, so we can get rid of her.

282
00:21:39,075 --> 00:21:42,352
Yes, recite me the poem
in the garden.

283
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,910
Who sent her here?

284
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:47,994
Who on earth sent her here?
I really don't know.

285
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:51,267
You come home
and find a crazy person waiting there.

286
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,786
She tells you her whole life –
she's an actress, she's tired...

287
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:58,909
I've got my own problems already,
I didn't need her here.

288
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:04,110
She's wasting our time.
"Now I'm tired, I no longer teach..."

289
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,875
No, she's far from being crazy.

290
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:09,555
She may be tired,
but she drank three eggs.

291
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:12,065
She doesn't have any manners.

292
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:15,825
I'd better lock the meat up.

293
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:19,346
We're wasting half an hour
to let her hear a poem.

294
00:22:19,475 --> 00:22:21,432
This is ridiculous.

295
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:24,468
We'll miss our appointment
with the photographer.

296
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:27,269
Doesn't she have anything better to do?

297
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:32,106
Wouldn't she rather be
at the park, where it's much cooler?

298
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:35,433
Instead of drinking other people's eggs!
I can't stand her.

299
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:38,309
This business about the eggs
is really bugging me.

300
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:41,155
- Madam, listen.
- Is the coffee ready?

301
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:44,985
It's coming.
Would you like it sweet?

302
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:50,190
The child is very good. But she'll get
to poetry later. Now, it's too soon.

303
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:55,106
It's tiring for her. I'm going to teach her
something new.

304
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:58,148
Let's find a quiet spot, let's see.

305
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:00,915
Here's perfect.

306
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:02,674
Give me your hand, follow me.

307
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,991
Come here, dear.

308
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:09,394
You'll see what I'm going teach you.
This is a lovely place.

309
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:14,754
Come here. Good girl.

310
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,595
Pretend that you are in a meadow.

311
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:22,744
A nice, large, green and cool meadow.

312
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,788
You have come here
to pick strawberries.

313
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:30,194
- Understand?
- Madam! Madam! She's deaf too.

314
00:23:30,315 --> 00:23:34,104
The first exercise is role-playing.

315
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:36,989
Basically, you pretend to be
in a certain situation.

316
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,835
Do you like strawberries?

317
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:42,390
So you're happy
to be picking strawberries.

318
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:46,872
Look how many strawberries
there are under that oak.

319
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:49,305
She's mad,
where does she see an oak?

320
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:51,666
Quick, go and pick them.

321
00:23:51,795 --> 00:23:53,673
Bend down. Good girl.

322
00:23:53,795 --> 00:23:57,266
Pick them, there are so many.
Look how many.

323
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:01,787
And she's so silly to listen to her.
Madam, you're turning her brain to jelly.

324
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:04,225
Maria, what are you doing?

325
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:06,347
She's picking strawberries.

326
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:10,264
Can't you see?
She's picking strawberries.

327
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:12,671
Give it to me, dear.
What a nice strawberry.

328
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:17,551
Bend down and pick it. Good girl.
See? They don't understand anything.

329
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:19,155
If she doesn't leave...

330
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:23,867
Hurry! How long does it take you
to come here, darling?

331
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,271
We're running late.

332
00:24:26,395 --> 00:24:28,387
She was driving us crazy.
Who is she?

333
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:30,711
You must only listen to mum.

334
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:32,986
Come on, we're late.

335
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:38,345
Wash your hands now.

336
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:42,025
Here's some water.
Get the soap, come on. Hurry up.

337
00:24:42,155 --> 00:24:44,829
Look at the state of you.
Were you in the coal shed?

338
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:47,789
How slow are you?

339
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:51,113
Can you not be any quicker?
Rinse your hands, come on.

340
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:53,192
And also your face.

341
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:56,308
Look at the state of you.
In the meanwhile, I'll get ready.

342
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,951
What a strange person that woman.

343
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:02,112
"Go and pick the strawberries."

344
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:07,071
She was just joking, darling.
She was teaching you how to act.

345
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:09,232
Yes, to act...

346
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:12,951
After all, what is acting?

347
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:15,112
If I imagined to be someone else...

348
00:25:15,235 --> 00:25:17,431
if I pretended to be someone else...

349
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:19,786
I'd be acting.

350
00:25:19,915 --> 00:25:21,634
You're not interested, are you?

351
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:26,470
It's like when you say the nice poem
about the butterfly. How does it go?

352
00:25:26,595 --> 00:25:29,190
"I'm a butterfly,
half white and half yellow."

353
00:25:29,315 --> 00:25:31,546
The one where you move
your hands like this.

354
00:25:33,435 --> 00:25:35,074
Say the poem.

355
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:38,586
"I'm a butterfly
half white and half yellow."

356
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:40,308
What about the hands?

357
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:43,746
Gosh! You see? You can act too.

358
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,515
You can act.

359
00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:49,514
But make sure you don't stutter, honey.

360
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:52,514
Don't stutter, okay?

361
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,991
Let's go, we're late.

362
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:57,914
Listen to her
and you'll end up picking strawberries.

363
00:25:58,035 --> 00:26:00,834
You listen to mummy. The other
mums here make me laugh.

364
00:26:00,955 --> 00:26:04,471
"My daughter this, my daughter that."
They're just not made for this.

365
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:07,713
But you're my daughter
and you can become an actress.

366
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:11,624
You really can. I could have too,
if I had wanted to.

367
00:26:13,915 --> 00:26:17,386
Let me fix your hair.
You look so messy.

368
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:19,905
Let's see how you look
with a centre parting.

369
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:25,315
No, you look ugly. Never mind.

370
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:28,712
All combed back, like mummy.

371
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:31,225
Let's see.

372
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,067
How pretty!

373
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,187
Let me undo your plaits.

374
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:41,104
Let's see. These plaits!

375
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:44,785
You're so pretty.

376
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:48,192
You look more simple and natural
in this way.

377
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,626
We'll have your photograph taken,
but it's all we can afford.

378
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:54,748
Do you understand, honey?

379
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,754
Mum, am I going back to school
tomorrow?

380
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,630
Dear Lord!
Now you're both stuttering and lisping.

381
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:04,907
- Say "school".
- School.

382
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:06,549
- School.
- School.

383
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:09,791
Are you doing this on purpose?

384
00:27:09,915 --> 00:27:13,306
You never stuttered or lisped before.
Say "school".

385
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:14,994
- School.
- Great.

386
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:18,552
Pronounce it properly,
you can't speak Roman dialect...

387
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:20,394
if you want to be an actress.

388
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:23,872
- Come here. Say "house".
- House.

389
00:27:23,995 --> 00:27:25,987
- House.
- House.

390
00:27:26,115 --> 00:27:28,550
This is a real problem.
And now "soap".

391
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:31,827
- Soap.
- No, say it properly, without lisping.

392
00:27:31,955 --> 00:27:33,355
- Soap.
- Soap.

393
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:36,752
You're making me lisp too, darling.

394
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:40,312
Get your shoes.
Go and get dressed over there.

395
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:44,873
Go and put your shoes on,
then put the dress on.

396
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:47,555
Careful not to mess up your hair.

397
00:27:56,915 --> 00:28:00,147
Here we go again! Every time
I open the window, you're there.

398
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:02,426
Get out of the way, please!

399
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,229
He's got no shame. And he's so young.

400
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:10,554
This is crazy. They come
right into your own house!

401
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:14,351
Yes, in your own house.
Gosh, I'm lisping too now.

402
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:17,229
What's going on here?

403
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:20,029
Are you ready, Maria?

404
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:23,785
Don't mess up your hair when you put
the dress on, or I'll smack you!

405
00:28:32,115 --> 00:28:33,834
That's too high.

406
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:35,548
Are you ready?

407
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:39,428
We're always rushing around.

408
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:42,389
Are you still there? How annoying.

409
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:47,311
What if that crazy woman was right?

410
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:52,146
Maybe you do need to study...

411
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:55,268
Maybe lisping runs in the family.
Maria, are you ready?

412
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:02,552
What does she look like?
Let me see her.

413
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:05,668
There you go. Excuse me.

414
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:07,593
How are you sitting her?

415
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:09,593
Like this.

416
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,787
That's not good.
Make her look more natural.

417
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:14,952
Mind your own business.

418
00:29:15,075 --> 00:29:19,308
Excuse my wife. She's been invalid
so long, and this is her only distraction.

419
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:20,835
Let's be quick.

420
00:29:20,955 --> 00:29:24,392
You can start choosing a pose.

421
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:28,555
- Sit up straight, petal.
- Do as I said.

422
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:32,112
I thought you knew each other.

423
00:29:32,235 --> 00:29:34,909
After all, you're both auditioning...

424
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:37,106
and are acquaintances of Annovazzi.

425
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:39,192
Me? I hardly know him.

426
00:29:39,315 --> 00:29:41,591
Maria, lift up your chin.

427
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:43,115
Come on.

428
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:46,751
Lift up your chin.
Keep your head straight.

429
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:50,869
I met him for the first time at Cinecittà
and he was interested in the child.

430
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:53,635
Look that way.
Don't cry, sweetheart.

431
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:56,634
We'll take a nice picture of you.
Aren't you happy?

432
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,587
He suggested I come to see you.

433
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:03,428
He liked her eyes the most.

434
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:04,955
Yes, her eyes.

435
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:10,275
Darling, why are you crying?

436
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:14,184
Poor thing, she's not used to this.
She's scared.

437
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:18,635
Smile, come on.

438
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:21,748
I see your child takes ballet classes.

439
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:25,346
- They have to dance in the film, right?
- No, they don't. Who said so?

440
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:29,185
I thought they had to, because one
of the other girls who came here...

441
00:30:29,315 --> 00:30:31,910
- ...was at the Opera School.
- The Ruscaja School.

442
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:34,504
- No, the Opera School.
- The Ruscaja School.

443
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,035
How annoying!

444
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:39,273
Excuse me, are you really sure
they have to dance?

445
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:43,787
In the novel the film is based on,
the child dances.

446
00:30:43,915 --> 00:30:46,908
I've read it. The novel starts in that way.

447
00:30:47,035 --> 00:30:50,107
I don't want to insist,
but I think you're wrong.

448
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:54,229
It doesn't start in that way, it starts
with her saying she has had enough.

449
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:59,225
It starts like that. And the child dances
around the table on her birthday.

450
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:02,075
No, she tells him that she's leaving him.

451
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:06,189
He wants to kill her, and the daughter,
who is so happy because of the party...

452
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:10,753
is dancing and fooling around
the table, where the cake is.

453
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:14,755
- In the book the child dances.
- Excuse me.

454
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,435
Anyway, the more they can do,
the better.

455
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,990
Dancing is not necessary.

456
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:23,392
- Are you ready, sweetheart?
- Wait, I'll fix her hair.

457
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,666
Madam, keep out of the way.

458
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:27,866
Smile to the man, look at the camera.

459
00:31:29,995 --> 00:31:31,395
Done!

460
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,906
- You almost set me on fire.
- It was fine.

461
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:38,233
You scared her,
she probably closed her eyes.

462
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,153
No, she had her eyes wide open.

463
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,153
- Are you sure?
- Don't worry, madam.

464
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,347
- That's all I'm interested in.
- Madam, I'm very busy.

465
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:48,547
- I'm the photographer.
- Okay, no need to get upset.

466
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:52,225
- It's Isabella's turn.
- Darling, were your eyes open?

467
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:56,144
- Yes.
- You tell a lot of lies. Were you scared?

468
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:59,074
Or else we're wasting
time and money here.

469
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:01,346
Excuse me, when can I see
the negatives?

470
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:03,114
Come back tomorrow morning.

471
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:07,593
- Can I please come this evening?
- I can't have them ready tonight.

472
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:10,992
- Come back tomorrow morning.
- You're so kind.

473
00:32:11,115 --> 00:32:15,632
Do you want to take it home?
I'll get you one like it.

474
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:19,465
We're late. Take the bag.
Dad must be starving.

475
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:21,587
- Good-bye and many thanks.
- Not at all.

476
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:24,435
These photos are very important.
I'm in your hands.

477
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:26,626
- Don't worry.
- Good-bye.

478
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:28,906
- Don't worry.
- Say bye to the gentleman.

479
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:31,834
- Say bye.
- Bye, sweetheart.

480
00:32:33,275 --> 00:32:36,473
<i>The needle's ready</i>
<i>Just keep steady...</i>

481
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:38,587
- Are you ready, madam?
- Yes, I am.

482
00:32:38,715 --> 00:32:40,866
Good, me too.

483
00:32:40,995 --> 00:32:43,715
Choose a place
where you want to have the injection.

484
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:45,713
I've found it. It's on the right side.

485
00:32:45,835 --> 00:32:48,270
But you've got so many bruises
on that side.

486
00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:50,148
But it hurts on the other side.

487
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:52,710
Okay, then. Let's do it on the right side.

488
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:54,713
But if it hurts, don't complain.

489
00:32:54,835 --> 00:32:59,466
- Is it Penicillin today?
- No, you are done with that.

490
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:02,713
- So what is it?
- We're starting the Balerofosforo again.

491
00:33:02,835 --> 00:33:07,466
- I've had a whole box of that.
- But you need more. You're worn-out.

492
00:33:07,595 --> 00:33:10,588
Just look at the white of your eyes.

493
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:13,184
You're big built, but very weak.

494
00:33:13,315 --> 00:33:16,194
- I hope it works.
- What a chatterbox!

495
00:33:16,315 --> 00:33:21,071
You're making me waste so much time,
when I'm so busy. Are you ready?

496
00:33:21,195 --> 00:33:24,506
- I'm ready.
- Can I use your phone later, please?

497
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:28,311
Are you still lying there?
Come on, just find a place.

498
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:31,951
I have to call my daughter.
We've had the photographs taken.

499
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:35,307
They're really nice.
Come on, turn over.

500
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:37,745
You're going to set the bed on fire.

501
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:41,915
Come on, turn over.

502
00:33:42,035 --> 00:33:45,346
- Don't hurt me.
- Look at all this abundance.

503
00:33:45,475 --> 00:33:47,467
- Who enjoys all of this?
- Who knows?

504
00:33:47,595 --> 00:33:49,712
- Relax your leg.
- Don't hurt me

505
00:33:49,835 --> 00:33:53,033
I'm in a rush. I have to go
to see the Commendatore afterwards.

506
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:56,432
- He's diabetic, poor thing.
- Poor him.

507
00:33:56,555 --> 00:34:00,868
- You drink, eat and smoke too much.
- They're my vices.

508
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:04,352
- I can't help it.
- Come on, relax your leg.

509
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,626
Don't hurt me.

510
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:13,353
- You hurt me!
- You make me sweat when I come here.

511
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:16,229
You haven't even felt the needle.

512
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:18,665
I have such a light hand.

513
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:23,631
The Commendatore says that
he wants only me for his injections.

514
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:27,271
- He must be in love.
- I don't care, as long as he has them.

515
00:34:27,395 --> 00:34:30,274
All done. You're as good as new now.

516
00:34:30,395 --> 00:34:34,435
- Can I do this phone call now?
- Of course.

517
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:38,071
Thanks. If you don't mind,
I'll take the phone over there...

518
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:40,585
because I don't want to spill anything.

519
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:42,707
- Okay.
- Do you have guests today?

520
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:45,589
- No, it's my breakfast.
- No less!

521
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:48,310
- Do you eat four eggs?
- I need to get back on my feet.

522
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:51,872
Your liver must be bombproof!

523
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:54,829
- Madam, why is she complaining?
- No idea.

524
00:34:54,955 --> 00:35:00,633
- Do you need an injection too?
- No, I don't need it, right, madam?

525
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:04,544
Of course you need it.
You have so much room in that body.

526
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:07,315
You're fat but I'll help you slim down.

527
00:35:07,435 --> 00:35:10,030
Where did you find her?

528
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:14,786
Hello? Mrs. Gisella?

529
00:35:14,915 --> 00:35:17,589
Hi. This is Mrs. Cecconi.

530
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,025
Yes. Can you do me a favour?

531
00:35:20,155 --> 00:35:22,750
Thanks. My daughter is in the courtyard.

532
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:27,154
Could you tell her...
No, don't worry about going downstairs.

533
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:29,426
Just tell her from the balcony...

534
00:35:29,555 --> 00:35:32,150
that I'm not coming back...

535
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:35,154
and she is to carry on with her lesson.

536
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:38,507
The acting lesson. She's in the courtyard
with her teacher.

537
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:41,867
And tell her that we'll collect
that stuff tomorrow.

538
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:47,189
A black cat crossed my path,
how unlucky.

539
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,108
What's he doing?

540
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:02,430
Has he died?

541
00:36:02,555 --> 00:36:04,751
- Who is it?
- Finally.

542
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,151
It's me, Mrs. Cecconi. Good morning.

543
00:36:07,275 --> 00:36:09,073
Oh, yes. Sorry.

544
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:11,755
- She's locked herself in.
- Come in.

545
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,275
Another black cat.

546
00:36:13,395 --> 00:36:16,388
- Don't be afraid.
- No. How's the barrister?

547
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:19,747
- God! Another one.
- Let me tell you.

548
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:23,755
He's not well.
He's got high temperature again.

549
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:28,552
The doctor said to start again taking
the Streptomycin every 12 hours.

550
00:36:28,675 --> 00:36:31,349
And not to stop,
even if his temperature goes down.

551
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:34,149
- Of course.
- You thought this was your last visit.

552
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,995
Instead, you'll have to come back
many more times.

553
00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:39,266
- Luckily.
- What do you mean?

554
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:43,867
No, I meant, luckily for him
I can come back.

555
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:45,748
I'll be right there.

556
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,868
I'll take the syringe
and I'll be there in a minute.

557
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:51,032
I'll be very quiet.

558
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:54,831
He's not well, after all...
Good for me!

559
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:58,949
Five days, and the dress is paid. Thank
you, St. Joseph. You're so good to me.

560
00:36:59,075 --> 00:37:02,307
I'll light a candle to you
when it's all finished.

561
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:08,674
- Eleonora, what are you doing?
- Wait, I'm coming.

562
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:10,946
Hurry, don't keep the lady waiting.

563
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:14,785
- This is all the tulle I've found.
- What are you talking about?

564
00:37:14,915 --> 00:37:17,384
- The stockroom is full.
- That's all I've found.

565
00:37:17,515 --> 00:37:20,587
- You're talking rubbish.
- Look, madam.

566
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:23,787
- Do you like it?
- Beautiful. It looks as soft as a cloud.

567
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:26,191
- Let me touch it.
- Sure.

568
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:29,228
- Isn't it a bit hard?
- Look at this other one.

569
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:31,950
It's a pre-war fabric.
I can give you a good price.

570
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:35,466
- This looks better. It's very soft.
- See?

571
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:38,429
This is the pattern –
a fluffy tulle skirt...

572
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:42,390
and the sleeveless satin leotard.
Have you seen "The Red Shoes"?

573
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:46,270
I'll make you something like that.
You'll be pleased with it.

574
00:37:46,395 --> 00:37:49,229
You'll be beautiful, darling.
Do you like it?

575
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:53,872
- I'm a bit concerned about the price.
- Don't worry. I'll give you a good price.

576
00:37:53,995 --> 00:37:59,548
I have had to spend a lot of money
recently for my little girl...

577
00:37:59,675 --> 00:38:03,635
so I thought
I'd mention this just in case.

578
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:06,634
I'm a nurse,
so should you need any injections...

579
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:09,589
Are you joking? I hope I won't need them.

580
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:12,469
I am in very good health.

581
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:15,588
You don't need to have injections
only when you're ill.

582
00:38:15,715 --> 00:38:19,186
You can also have them when you're
well, to keep in good shape.

583
00:38:19,315 --> 00:38:21,352
Did you come here to jinx me?

584
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:25,947
No, but maybe you have a relative
who needs treatment.

585
00:38:26,075 --> 00:38:28,909
I'm fine,
I don't need any injections.

586
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:33,268
The same goes for my family. Right,
girls? I don't buy into these sort of things.

587
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:37,184
Come here, darling, I'll measure you.

588
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,194
Up here, come on.

589
00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:19,475
That one is so cute.
She must be my daughter's age.

590
00:39:19,595 --> 00:39:21,587
- Yeah, she's young.
- Yes.

591
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:25,633
Goodness gracious!

592
00:39:31,075 --> 00:39:35,672
Excuse me, madam. Why is she always
keeping her close to the wall?

593
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:38,071
She'll hurt herself.

594
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:41,871
Don't worry, she won't hurt herself.
It takes time.

595
00:39:41,995 --> 00:39:46,274
We don't have time, we're in a hurry.
She should put her with the others.

596
00:39:49,795 --> 00:39:52,355
Don't you agree, madam?

597
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:05,870
She's still keeping her by the wall.

598
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:16,106
Excuse me, but why is my daughter
always stuck by the wall?

599
00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:18,431
Couldn't you put her
with the others?

600
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:21,024
They've been studying
for three years.

601
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:24,387
You came in here saying,
"Make her dance like a butterfly."

602
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:27,826
What do you expect?

603
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:29,867
And she's so small.

604
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:31,793
Why, how old does she need to be?

605
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:35,591
- Eight.
- We can't wait another three years.

606
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:39,231
Say what you want, my dear.
She's got tiny legs...

607
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:43,429
She's got two perfectly straight legs,
can't you see?

608
00:40:43,555 --> 00:40:46,753
Having straight legs is not enough.

609
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:49,913
You need other things,
such as intelligence.

610
00:40:50,035 --> 00:40:52,504
You dance with your head,
not your feet.

611
00:40:52,635 --> 00:40:54,035
What?

612
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:56,351
You dance with your head,
not your feet.

613
00:40:56,475 --> 00:41:00,947
My daughter has brains,
she was born healthy, my dear lady!

614
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:03,670
This is your opinion.
I'm starting to get annoyed.

615
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:07,106
We are the teachers. We say
if a child is intelligent or not.

616
00:41:07,235 --> 00:41:10,034
I can say that because I'm her mother.

617
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:11,828
My daughter is not dumb.

618
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:17,433
Sweetheart.

619
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:20,548
Why are you crying, my darling?

620
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:23,827
They're not going to hurt you.
You'll become a good dancer.

621
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:27,153
Look how good that one over there is.

622
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:30,507
See? Don't you want
to become like her?

623
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:33,514
You'll become very good too.

624
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:36,434
Did you have to make her cry?
How rude.

625
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:39,593
Let's go home now.
Show me a nice smile.

626
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:42,674
Don't let Daddy see you cry.

627
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:46,914
I understand that the child
is a bit disheartened now...

628
00:41:47,035 --> 00:41:51,473
but I'm telling you now that
in this place people study very hard.

629
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:55,384
I've been dancing for 40 years,
but if I didn't practice every day...

630
00:41:55,515 --> 00:42:01,034
I wouldn't be able to
do <i>arabesques</i> and all the rest.

631
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:03,147
See?

632
00:42:06,635 --> 00:42:09,195
- Very good.
- Placida, tell the lady.

633
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:13,673
Yes, madam. In here,
you have to study and sweat.

634
00:42:13,795 --> 00:42:17,994
- Sweat and sweat.
- That's right.

635
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:36,066
- Hi, Spartaco.
- So, now you go out even after dinner?

636
00:42:36,195 --> 00:42:38,346
And you take the child too.

637
00:42:39,355 --> 00:42:43,395
What else could I do? You were not
here, I couldn't leave her at home alone.

638
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:47,714
- Where have you been?
- I went to give injections.

639
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:52,231
Say hi to Dad.

640
00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:56,144
Hello, darling. Give Daddy a big kiss.

641
00:43:00,755 --> 00:43:02,553
- Maddalena.
- Yes?

642
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:07,272
The instalments have gone up
from 60,000 lire to 65,000 lire.

643
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:09,785
- Why?
- Because of the lift.

644
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:14,114
We didn't count that. But everybody
paid for it, and so will we.

645
00:43:16,475 --> 00:43:18,467
What did you get up to?

646
00:43:19,635 --> 00:43:21,831
- Tell Daddy.
- I'm tired.

647
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:23,355
Little petal.

648
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:28,670
This is the new house that Daddy has
bought for you. Here we'll put your bed.

649
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:32,350
And Daddy will buy you a Pinocchio.

650
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:34,751
Do you know the story of Pinocchio?

651
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:41,224
The boy whose nose grew longer
because of all the lies he told.

652
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:44,951
He lied to his father,
an old man who...

653
00:43:57,555 --> 00:44:01,947
Here there's only 60,000 lire.

654
00:44:02,075 --> 00:44:04,271
I don't have any money left.

655
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:06,705
What am I going to do?

656
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:12,234
Spartaco, is the instalment definitely
due next Monday?

657
00:44:12,355 --> 00:44:14,586
Yes, on Monday.

658
00:44:14,715 --> 00:44:19,153
It's only an extra 5,000 lire and I have
a few people who owe me money.

659
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:24,745
You haven't fed the child.

660
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:27,709
As if I was starving her.

661
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:30,031
Anything else?

662
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,992
She had a big cup of coffee with milk
and two cookies.

663
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:37,550
Tell him.

664
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,189
Mum is going to undress you.

665
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:42,228
- Let me do it.
- Careful, you'll tear her dress.

666
00:44:42,355 --> 00:44:44,870
Okay, do it yourself then.

667
00:44:47,715 --> 00:44:50,435
- Give it to me.
- Dad will put you to bed.

668
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:53,354
Tomorrow I'll take you out
and buy you a nice ice cream.

669
00:44:53,475 --> 00:44:55,546
Ice cream makes her tummy ache.

670
00:44:55,675 --> 00:44:58,065
Maddalena, go next door.

671
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,791
Sure,
you know I do whatever you say.

672
00:45:01,915 --> 00:45:04,510
Did you see how tired she looks?

673
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,513
Leave me alone.

674
00:45:06,635 --> 00:45:10,026
How pretty. The baby of the house.

675
00:45:12,195 --> 00:45:15,347
Do you love your dad?
Give me a big kiss and a pinch.

676
00:45:18,795 --> 00:45:21,355
Listen, don't tell anything to Mum.

677
00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:23,751
Tomorrow Dad
will buy you an ice cream.

678
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:25,912
Are you happy?

679
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:27,833
I have a lesson tomorrow.

680
00:45:27,955 --> 00:45:31,585
A lesson? No, tomorrow
you go out with Dad, no lesson.

681
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:35,392
Give me a big kiss.

682
00:45:38,355 --> 00:45:40,347
And now go to sleep.

683
00:45:57,915 --> 00:45:59,907
<i>If they're tired, they won't escape.</i>

684
00:46:00,035 --> 00:46:03,312
<i>Don't drive them too hard</i>
<i>the whole time...</i>

685
00:46:03,435 --> 00:46:05,631
See? It's Montgomery Cliff.

686
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:07,428
He's nice, isn't he?

687
00:46:12,075 --> 00:46:14,590
Maddalena, forget about cinema.

688
00:46:16,355 --> 00:46:18,347
Spartaco, you don't understand me.

689
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:22,351
Look at those beautiful places.

690
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,513
And look where we live.

691
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:31,393
When I see these things...

692
00:46:31,515 --> 00:46:33,666
Maddalena, it's a fantasy world.

693
00:46:33,795 --> 00:46:35,275
It's not.

694
00:46:36,115 --> 00:46:40,189
Look. They're taking the wagon across.

695
00:46:40,315 --> 00:46:42,193
Unbelievable.

696
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:46,351
The horses are in the water.

697
00:46:46,475 --> 00:46:48,307
Lucky them.

698
00:46:49,715 --> 00:46:52,071
It's great, isn't it?

699
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:57,347
How beautiful.

700
00:46:58,635 --> 00:47:01,230
I'm falling asleep.

701
00:47:02,475 --> 00:47:06,105
- I can't keep my eyes open.
- Come on, let's go to bed.

702
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:27,546
- Listen, with this ticket you can't...
- No, I'm first!

703
00:47:27,675 --> 00:47:31,032
- I'm in front of her.
- Madam, stop being so pushy.

704
00:47:31,155 --> 00:47:33,112
- I'm not pushy.
- Calm down.

705
00:47:33,235 --> 00:47:36,831
He's holding my ticket and you still
come here and say you are first.

706
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:38,867
- Where do I go?
- The room next door.

707
00:47:38,995 --> 00:47:42,545
- What is the matter with you?
- So many injustices in this world.

708
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:47,591
- She just doesn't shut up.
- So pushy.

709
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:51,709
- Don't you ever get tired?
- I'm so tired I can hardly stand up.

710
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,235
It doesn't look like it.

711
00:47:53,355 --> 00:47:58,953
Look, madam. I had my granddaughter's
photograph taken...

712
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:02,671
but I made her stand up
because I think she looks better.

713
00:48:02,795 --> 00:48:05,993
- Definitely.
- We only took one, it was so expensive.

714
00:48:06,115 --> 00:48:09,313
- They told me one is enough.
- Of course it's enough.

715
00:48:09,435 --> 00:48:11,711
- Did you want to bring the whole film?
- True.

716
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:13,508
My child has only got one too.

717
00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:16,594
The photographer wanted to take it while
she was dancing.

718
00:48:16,715 --> 00:48:19,594
I told him that she'd show
what she can do at the audition.

719
00:48:19,715 --> 00:48:21,866
This is if they choose her
for the audition.

720
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:25,432
I've heard that they've already
made their choice.

721
00:48:25,555 --> 00:48:27,751
We're all wasting our time here.

722
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:31,755
I wouldn't be saying this
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.

723
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:35,186
- What have you seen?
- Tell us.

724
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:38,865
Well, yesterday I came here because
I got the days mixed up...

725
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:42,306
Mixed up! No, she did that on purpose
to get here before all of us.

726
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:45,507
No, madam, I genuinely made a mistake.

727
00:48:45,635 --> 00:48:48,912
Basically, they were doing
their special auditions.

728
00:48:49,035 --> 00:48:50,992
Yes, for those who were recommended.

729
00:48:51,115 --> 00:48:56,873
I've seen it with my own eyes.
There was a lady with a child...

730
00:48:56,995 --> 00:48:59,988
and she didn't ask for the director.

731
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:03,233
- She asked for the other one.
- Who?

732
00:49:03,355 --> 00:49:07,190
The fat and ugly one. The one
that yells into the megaphone all the time.

733
00:49:07,315 --> 00:49:09,625
The nasty one.

734
00:49:09,755 --> 00:49:12,350
- Glori!
- So what?

735
00:49:12,475 --> 00:49:18,585
As soon as he saw her, he said
that the girl was very pretty.

736
00:49:18,715 --> 00:49:21,469
What's wrong with that?
My child's pretty too.

737
00:49:21,595 --> 00:49:25,225
He was saying how pretty she was,
but he was looking at the mother.

738
00:49:25,355 --> 00:49:28,427
- Ah, now I understand.
- That's how it goes nowadays.

739
00:49:28,555 --> 00:49:33,789
It doesn't mean anything.
You're just making a big deal out of it.

740
00:49:33,915 --> 00:49:37,192
Do they think we are all stupid here?

741
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:42,106
Probably, but I know exactly
what that lady is talking about.

742
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:45,546
But we'll go and speak to the producer,
the director...

743
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:48,986
and we'll tell them
that this is a disgrace.

744
00:49:49,115 --> 00:49:53,746
It's clear that there are favourites,
while we should all be equal.

745
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:58,028
Yes, this isn't fair. We have
to do something about it.

746
00:49:58,155 --> 00:50:02,195
Actually, I think my husband knows
someone who works here.

747
00:50:02,315 --> 00:50:05,865
I'll call him and ask him to put
a good word for me with Stella Film.

748
00:50:05,995 --> 00:50:09,193
My husband is a friend of one
of the phone company directors'.

749
00:50:09,315 --> 00:50:14,151
What have the phone company directors
got to do with this?

750
00:50:14,275 --> 00:50:18,315
Well, he's an important person,
that's all that matters.

751
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:23,351
Don't make us laugh. If we want, we can
all find someone to pull strings for us.

752
00:50:23,475 --> 00:50:25,353
We can all find someone important.

753
00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:28,991
I have a relative who knows
a waiter in Cinecittà.

754
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:34,031
He knows him very well.
He's got such a good job...

755
00:50:34,155 --> 00:50:36,795
Excuse me, what are you doing?

756
00:50:43,755 --> 00:50:47,146
Federico, I'm in a rush.

757
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:51,188
- Good morning.
- Bath or shower?

758
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:56,435
No, thanks.
We just need a trim and set.

759
00:50:56,555 --> 00:50:59,115
That way, please.
Amerigo, a haircut!

760
00:50:59,235 --> 00:51:02,626
- Don't we need the receipt?
- No, it's okay.

761
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:05,429
- Thanks.
- Can you add colour as well?

762
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:08,548
- Are you joking?
- She needs lighter hair.

763
00:51:08,675 --> 00:51:12,988
Lighten it? If I take her home
blond, all hell will break loose.

764
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:14,549
It's just a slight...

765
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:18,669
She only needs a trim and some curls.

766
00:51:18,795 --> 00:51:21,310
One moment, after this lady it's your turn.

767
00:51:21,435 --> 00:51:24,428
What? Where are you?
They're making us waste time here.

768
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:28,231
- If it's only five minutes...
- Listen to me.

769
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:32,065
- We'll give you a good tip.
- That's not the point.

770
00:51:32,195 --> 00:51:36,109
But it's going to take two minutes.
Come here, darling, let me show him.

771
00:51:36,235 --> 00:51:39,194
It's just a trim...

772
00:51:39,715 --> 00:51:42,708
and a couple of curls
over the shoulders.

773
00:51:42,835 --> 00:51:45,031
Can't you see that I'm busy
with this lady?

774
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:47,989
- But she's almost finished.
- I haven't finished

775
00:51:48,115 --> 00:51:50,391
I've paid, I have my rights.

776
00:51:50,515 --> 00:51:52,825
Do you want to stay here
until tomorrow?

777
00:51:52,955 --> 00:51:56,187
I have another client waiting.
You don't have an appointment.

778
00:51:56,315 --> 00:51:58,910
But it will take you two minutes,
do me a favour.

779
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:02,073
- Leave her there, I'll serve her later.
- You're so moody.

780
00:52:02,195 --> 00:52:04,187
- Do the balloons bother you?
- It's okay.

781
00:52:04,315 --> 00:52:07,592
You're so kind.
See how kind this man is, darling?

782
00:52:07,715 --> 00:52:10,514
Sit here. Give me the balloons
so I'll tie them here.

783
00:52:10,635 --> 00:52:12,547
- Do they bother you here?
- No.

784
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:15,554
They'll keep you company.
Mum will be right back.

785
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:18,509
- Be good. Will we make it back in time?
- Yes, I think so.

786
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,151
If I don't come back, Mrs. Spernanzoni
will come and pick you up.

787
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:25,188
If I can't make it, a blond lady
will come on my behalf.

788
00:52:25,315 --> 00:52:28,353
She's a middle-aged lady.
Her name is Tilde Spernanzoni.

789
00:52:28,475 --> 00:52:31,434
She looks a bit odd.
She's her acting teacher.

790
00:52:31,555 --> 00:52:35,151
- You'll recognize her immediately. Okay?
- I don't want to stay here!

791
00:52:35,275 --> 00:52:38,666
What do you mean? You have to.

792
00:52:38,795 --> 00:52:40,912
They'll make you so beautiful.

793
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:43,948
If you have to stay with her,
we can go another day.

794
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:46,112
No, it's not possible.

795
00:52:46,235 --> 00:52:51,867
Okay. Remember to lighten her hair
to make it a softer shade.

796
00:52:51,995 --> 00:52:55,306
- You want colour.
- No, she's not having it coloured.

797
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:58,826
Not a real dye.
Just highlights, natural streaks.

798
00:52:58,955 --> 00:53:00,947
Just lighter streaks?

799
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:03,909
- And a light perm.
- No, don't ruin her hair.

800
00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:07,915
Not a perm, just a set. Her hair's too fine
and won't stay in place otherwise.

801
00:53:08,035 --> 00:53:11,346
- She took it from me.
- I could give you a nice hair-do too.

802
00:53:11,475 --> 00:53:14,593
Don't even try,
no one has managed that.

803
00:53:14,715 --> 00:53:17,355
- I could manage.
- You'd waste your time.

804
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:19,546
Anyway, how much is it?

805
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:22,588
- 1,250 lire.
- Shall I pay over there?

806
00:53:22,715 --> 00:53:25,105
- Let's go.
- Be good.

807
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:28,785
Make sure you just trim her hair,
and curl it a little...

808
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:31,111
so that when I comb it, it's all fluffy.

809
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:34,111
- Be good, darling.
- Let's go.

810
00:53:34,235 --> 00:53:35,988
Mum is coming back.

811
00:53:36,115 --> 00:53:38,675
I don't want to stay here!

812
00:53:38,795 --> 00:53:41,310
Hey, you're not alone,
the gentleman is here.

813
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:44,507
- Be good.
- Bye.

814
00:53:44,635 --> 00:53:47,787
I don't want to stay here!

815
00:53:47,915 --> 00:53:53,673
Don't start. If you behave,
I'll buy you some sweets afterwards.

816
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:56,674
Be good and I'll curl your hair nicely.

817
00:53:56,795 --> 00:54:01,187
Amerigo, you have to set my hair.
It's still all wet.

818
00:54:01,315 --> 00:54:04,149
Michele will take care of you.
Just a minute.

819
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:07,109
- I don't want Michele.
- Michele, come here.

820
00:54:07,235 --> 00:54:08,715
Coming!

821
00:54:08,835 --> 00:54:14,149
I want to go home!
I want my mum!

822
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:16,346
- Yes, Amerigo?
- Trim this child's hair.

823
00:54:16,475 --> 00:54:18,751
How can I? I'm very busy.

824
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:21,151
- Call Guido.
- Okay, I'll call Guido.

825
00:54:21,275 --> 00:54:23,995
- Hurry up!
- I went to get the shampoo.

826
00:54:24,115 --> 00:54:27,153
- You're always complaining.
- Come on.

827
00:54:27,275 --> 00:54:31,986
- I want to see my mum!
- Guido, give her a trim

828
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:35,745
I want to see my mum!

829
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:39,630
Just give the child a trim,
then maybe she'll pipe down.

830
00:54:39,755 --> 00:54:43,146
- Amerigo, are you ready?
- Coming.

831
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:46,712
- Just a simple trim, okay?
- Yes.

832
00:54:46,835 --> 00:54:49,031
- I'll take care of her.
- Amerigo, hurry up.

833
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:52,193
- I'm coming.
- Just a little trim?

834
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:55,991
- Yes, just a trim.
- Let's cut it here... And here.

835
00:54:56,115 --> 00:54:59,870
I had an appointment
and now I am late because of a child.

836
00:54:59,995 --> 00:55:03,511
- That's one done.
- This is ridiculous.

837
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:07,026
- Amerigo.
- I'm coming.

838
00:55:07,155 --> 00:55:09,351
And that's the second one.
Are you happy?

839
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:14,834
Are you happy, Miss?
Is that okay?

840
00:55:19,755 --> 00:55:23,146
I wonder what you must be thinking
of me since I asked you to meet me.

841
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:26,791
What can I think? When a beautiful lady
asks to meet me...

842
00:55:26,915 --> 00:55:29,589
I think well, very well of her.

843
00:55:29,715 --> 00:55:31,866
If you see it like this, even better.

844
00:55:49,795 --> 00:55:52,515
I'm not used to long walks anymore.

845
00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:57,552
Listen, be honest.

846
00:55:57,675 --> 00:56:00,873
Do you think my daughter can make it?

847
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:02,873
I'm a little discouraged.

848
00:56:02,995 --> 00:56:08,150
For no reason, you convince yourself
that something is very easy to get...

849
00:56:08,275 --> 00:56:10,915
and then you don't think so anymore.

850
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,186
You start feeling worried.

851
00:56:13,315 --> 00:56:15,147
I'm not sure if you know what I mean.

852
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:19,747
I wouldn't want to make
so many sacrifices...

853
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:22,629
and then see
someone who's been recommended win.

854
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:24,906
You do understand me, don't you?

855
00:56:25,035 --> 00:56:26,628
Yes, but it depends on you.

856
00:56:26,755 --> 00:56:28,235
What do you mean?

857
00:56:28,355 --> 00:56:32,144
- A recommendation can help or hinder.
- No, no. It helps.

858
00:56:32,275 --> 00:56:36,315
We're so used to recommendations,
both to making and receiving them.

859
00:56:36,835 --> 00:56:40,465
If they were really worth something,
unemployment wouldn't exist.

860
00:56:40,595 --> 00:56:44,271
In Italy we rely on recommendations,
"Please, don't forget."

861
00:56:44,395 --> 00:56:48,389
"I assure you", "I promise you."
But we can't remember everyone.

862
00:56:48,515 --> 00:56:51,553
Who are we supposed to remember
and why?

863
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:54,827
- There's only one foolproof method.
- What is it?

864
00:56:54,955 --> 00:56:56,912
Putting the person who needs help...

865
00:56:57,035 --> 00:57:00,267
in a position to ask for your help,
do you know what I mean?

866
00:57:02,555 --> 00:57:04,433
- No.
- Do you already want to leave?

867
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:06,751
No, it's so lovely here.

868
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:09,753
I've never been here before.

869
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:13,869
Actually, I've been here on a Sunday,
but it was too crowded.

870
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:16,146
Today it's very pleasant.

871
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:19,473
Yes, it's very nice, but it's not a place
to come to alone.

872
00:57:19,595 --> 00:57:25,512
You should come here
with someone nice.

873
00:57:25,635 --> 00:57:28,025
- Am I nice?
- Very.

874
00:57:28,155 --> 00:57:31,432
In that case, do me this favour, please.

875
00:57:31,555 --> 00:57:34,946
- You're the nicest.
- Even better.

876
00:57:35,075 --> 00:57:37,954
I want my daughter to have
the best recommendation ever.

877
00:57:38,075 --> 00:57:40,874
When the audition is over,
I'll sleep better.

878
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:44,386
Look, it's as if she'd already auditioned,
the result is certain.

879
00:57:44,515 --> 00:57:47,428
But it all depends on you, it's very simple.

880
00:57:48,835 --> 00:57:51,873
Now I understand.
Do you know what we say in Rome?

881
00:57:51,995 --> 00:57:55,067
"Nothing given, nothing received."

882
00:57:55,195 --> 00:57:58,313
- You're not only funny but also clever.
- Everybody says so.

883
00:57:58,435 --> 00:58:01,348
- And you're quick-witted.
- That's right.

884
00:58:16,315 --> 00:58:18,910
To make a big profit,
one must take a big risk.

885
00:58:19,035 --> 00:58:21,266
50,000 lire sounds fair to me.

886
00:58:21,395 --> 00:58:24,911
You must be out of your mind.
50,000 is a lot of money.

887
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,594
It's not peanuts.

888
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:28,786
Nowadays, 50,000 is nothing.

889
00:58:28,915 --> 00:58:32,067
Maybe to you,
but to me it means a lot of sacrifices.

890
00:58:32,195 --> 00:58:36,906
In our case, it's the bare minimum
to achieve our goal.

891
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:40,824
I'll manage the 50,000 lire
and get you a contract.

892
00:58:40,955 --> 00:58:46,075
You'll earn, at least, a million which is
20 times the amount you staked.

893
00:58:46,195 --> 00:58:47,993
Do you think I'll be spending it?

894
00:58:48,115 --> 00:58:51,347
The money's not for me but
for the favours we need to do in return.

895
00:58:51,475 --> 00:58:53,228
Who will you do these favours to?

896
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:55,187
To everyone and no one.

897
00:58:55,315 --> 00:58:59,992
A bunch of flowers to the producer's
wife, a bottle of perfume to his lover...

898
00:59:00,115 --> 00:59:02,835
who is often the wife
of the leading actor.

899
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:06,710
Things like that happen.
It's not that they need it...

900
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:11,148
but it helps them to remember a name.

901
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:13,870
In this case, your name – Cecconi.

902
00:59:13,995 --> 00:59:18,547
"Mrs. Cecconi, who sent that gift,
is very kind," and so on.

903
00:59:18,675 --> 00:59:21,395
The word will spread quickly.

904
00:59:21,515 --> 00:59:26,112
Have you ever thrown a pebble into a
pond? The pebble falls in just one spot...

905
00:59:26,235 --> 00:59:32,152
but from that spot waves ripple out
until they reach the ocean.

906
00:59:32,275 --> 00:59:35,188
- How shrewd you are.
- Shrewd?

907
00:59:35,315 --> 00:59:38,149
It's a practical way
of getting through life.

908
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:42,792
Listen, do I have to take this risk
without any guarantees?

909
00:59:42,915 --> 00:59:44,747
What risk would it be otherwise?

910
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,594
Do you want a guarantee?

911
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:50,106
I'll give it to you.
Your child will have a screen test.

912
00:59:50,235 --> 00:59:51,635
All right?

913
00:59:56,235 --> 00:59:57,635
I'm in.

914
00:59:58,355 --> 01:00:01,473
It's a deal.
Because I do have that sum.

915
01:00:01,595 --> 01:00:05,987
I even brought my savings book
with me, you see?

916
01:00:08,475 --> 01:00:10,865
The problem is,
I need the money straight away.

917
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,587
It doesn't matter.

918
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:16,707
Let's hurry. Banks are closed now...

919
01:00:16,835 --> 01:00:20,033
but a friend of mine will take my book
and give me the money.

920
01:00:20,155 --> 01:00:22,545
And then she'll withdraw the money
tomorrow.

921
01:00:23,675 --> 01:00:28,067
Listen, if it's a problem for you...

922
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:30,585
shall we just forget about it?

923
01:00:30,715 --> 01:00:33,105
Moreover...

924
01:00:33,235 --> 01:00:36,433
I wouldn't want to have
a business relation with you.

925
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:40,913
With you I'd prefer, maybe...

926
01:00:42,315 --> 01:00:43,908
I don't know...

927
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:48,713
I prefer it this way. It's much better.

928
01:00:48,835 --> 01:00:50,633
Let's hurry, it's late.

929
01:01:01,435 --> 01:01:04,872
- Did you bring the money?
- Of course. Here it is.

930
01:01:06,835 --> 01:01:09,714
One, two, three, four, 50,000.

931
01:01:09,835 --> 01:01:12,714
- Where's the scooter?
- Out here.

932
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:17,387
Here it is. Do you like it?

933
01:01:55,595 --> 01:02:00,989
<i>You and your beautiful smile</i>

934
01:02:02,755 --> 01:02:08,387
<i>You are easing my pain</i>

935
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:15,075
<i>You know</i>
<i>that you can't stay away from me</i>

936
01:02:17,035 --> 01:02:22,747
<i>I see you, my beloved</i>

937
01:02:24,195 --> 01:02:29,748
<i>You and your beautiful smile</i>

938
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:37,027
<i>Tell her that there's no one else</i>
<i>in my heart</i>

939
01:02:38,195 --> 01:02:45,432
<i>Tell her that I love her</i>
<i>more than ever before...</i>

940
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:50,387
- It's not my fault.
- Look at the state of that girl.

941
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:53,428
Where's her mother?

942
01:03:03,275 --> 01:03:06,666
Who's complaining?
All I'm saying is, I've had enough!

943
01:03:06,795 --> 01:03:08,593
The child has learned enough.

944
01:03:08,715 --> 01:03:11,628
Do you expect me to thank you
after you've ruined her?

945
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:16,272
Of course. I'm used
to being thanked and respected.

946
01:03:16,395 --> 01:03:21,231
I thank you and respect you. My wife
has paid you, this is the door. Out!

947
01:03:21,355 --> 01:03:24,314
Your wife is the only one
who understands art.

948
01:03:24,435 --> 01:03:26,631
Art, sure!

949
01:03:26,755 --> 01:03:29,350
- Come on, I said get out.
- Watch your language.

950
01:03:29,475 --> 01:03:31,785
Why are you shouting like this?

951
01:03:31,915 --> 01:03:38,185
- Are you mad? What's happening?
- It happens that I've had enough.

952
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,911
I don't want any strangers in my house.

953
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:44,231
I won't leave my daughter with her.

954
01:03:44,355 --> 01:03:47,746
In my life, I've never been lucky,
but I have been respected a lot.

955
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:51,186
Who should be interested
in your daughter anyway?

956
01:03:51,315 --> 01:03:53,386
- Don't exaggerate.
- No, madam.

957
01:03:53,515 --> 01:03:56,155
I've been patient,
but now I've had enough.

958
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:59,552
Do you understand me?
I've had enough!

959
01:03:59,675 --> 01:04:01,871
Will you stop making a scene?

960
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:05,113
- Get out, that's the door.
- Spartaco, please.

961
01:04:05,235 --> 01:04:07,306
Let me say something.

962
01:04:07,435 --> 01:04:10,109
Darling. What happened?

963
01:04:10,235 --> 01:04:12,704
Are you asking her? Where were you?

964
01:04:12,835 --> 01:04:15,475
You left the child with this wretch.

965
01:04:15,595 --> 01:04:18,155
- Are you calling me wretch?
- Yes, wretch!

966
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:21,985
- I'll report you to the police.
- Spartaco, don't make such a fuss.

967
01:04:22,115 --> 01:04:24,755
It looks shorter because
she's got curly hair.

968
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:26,707
I'll wet it and straighten it out.

969
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:31,034
- Yeah, make her catch bronchitis.
- I won't make her catch anything.

970
01:04:31,155 --> 01:04:33,226
Madam, why didn't you keep an eye
on her?

971
01:04:33,355 --> 01:04:36,154
- Look at the state of her.
- I'm not paid to look after her.

972
01:04:36,275 --> 01:04:37,675
I'm an actress.

973
01:04:37,795 --> 01:04:41,266
Yes, but you also have eyes.
Or just because you're an actress...

974
01:04:41,395 --> 01:04:44,308
if they cut her head off
you stand by and watch?

975
01:04:44,435 --> 01:04:46,267
This is the door, get out.

976
01:04:46,395 --> 01:04:48,193
- Excuse me.
- Who is she?

977
01:04:48,315 --> 01:04:49,715
Is Mrs. Cecconi here?

978
01:04:49,835 --> 01:04:51,986
- That's me.
- Fracassini the dressmakers.

979
01:04:52,115 --> 01:04:53,913
Shall I leave it here?

980
01:04:54,035 --> 01:04:56,869
Did I get here in time?
I have the invoice with me.

981
01:04:56,995 --> 01:04:59,635
- I must collect the money.
- Thank you.

982
01:04:59,755 --> 01:05:03,385
What did they do to you?
You have short hair.

983
01:05:03,515 --> 01:05:08,146
Don't take me for a fool.
Pay up what you owe me.

984
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:09,914
That's 1,260 lire

985
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,504
1,000 for yesterday's
and today's lessons...

986
01:05:12,635 --> 01:05:15,309
200 lire for
the child's haircut...

987
01:05:15,435 --> 01:05:18,507
and 60 lire for the tram.
Don't forget it.

988
01:05:18,635 --> 01:05:22,629
Don't get stressed.
We'll pay in full. I'll see to it.

989
01:05:22,755 --> 01:05:28,513
You won't see to anything.
You've got to stop this nonsense.

990
01:05:28,635 --> 01:05:30,945
- Hands off, Spartaco.
- How much do we owe you?

991
01:05:31,075 --> 01:05:33,635
There, 1,260. Now, go.

992
01:05:33,755 --> 01:05:36,987
- I'm 10 lire short.
- We'll give it to you.

993
01:05:37,115 --> 01:05:41,746
- You can keep it.
- How generous. Now, go!

994
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:43,275
- Scoundrel!
- Out!

995
01:05:43,395 --> 01:05:46,786
You did the right thing
by cutting her hair short.

996
01:05:46,915 --> 01:05:49,749
It will make her feel cooler,
isn't that right?

997
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:51,275
Why don't you just leave?

998
01:05:51,395 --> 01:05:54,786
- What's in there?
- Don't touch it. It's mine. Don't ruin it.

999
01:05:54,915 --> 01:05:57,111
- I paid it with my money.
- It's not true.

1000
01:05:57,235 --> 01:06:00,307
I never asked you for any money.

1001
01:06:00,435 --> 01:06:03,587
Spartaco, I beg you,
let's not fight over it.

1002
01:06:03,715 --> 01:06:08,995
No, Spartaco! You only act like this
because I'm weaker.

1003
01:06:09,115 --> 01:06:12,506
Can't you see
you're scaring the child?

1004
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:17,152
It's been a week from hell here.
You didn't take care of the house at all.

1005
01:06:17,275 --> 01:06:20,552
- Am I not in charge anymore?
- I've had enough of you.

1006
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:22,507
I've done far too much for you.

1007
01:06:22,635 --> 01:06:24,866
I've done far too much for you!
Get out!

1008
01:06:24,995 --> 01:06:27,112
- Get out!
- I'm going to kill you!

1009
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:30,273
- Go on, kill me, you lout!
- Am I a lout?

1010
01:06:30,395 --> 01:06:33,786
Concierge! Come down!

1011
01:06:33,915 --> 01:06:37,431
He's killing Mrs. Cecconi!

1012
01:06:37,555 --> 01:06:39,148
Concierge!

1013
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:43,554
- What's going on?
- Go inside. They're killing each other.

1014
01:06:43,675 --> 01:06:48,875
- Concierge!
- I'm coming, just a minute!

1015
01:06:48,995 --> 01:06:53,387
- I can't risk breaking a leg.
- It's the Cecconis again.

1016
01:06:53,515 --> 01:06:56,474
They're always fighting, damn it!

1017
01:07:04,115 --> 01:07:07,506
Are you going to stop it or not?

1018
01:07:13,355 --> 01:07:17,190
Spartaco, today you've really
crossed the line.

1019
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:19,784
Don't cry, darling.

1020
01:07:22,275 --> 01:07:25,268
I'm leaving this house. Let's go.

1021
01:07:27,235 --> 01:07:30,307
Spartaco, what are you doing?

1022
01:07:30,435 --> 01:07:32,950
If you take the child,
you won't see me again.

1023
01:07:33,075 --> 01:07:38,309
Take her away,
you think I'm not a good mother anyway.

1024
01:07:38,435 --> 01:07:41,633
He thinks he's the only one
who loves her and makes sacrifices.

1025
01:07:41,755 --> 01:07:44,350
I am the one who ruins her.
And do you know why?

1026
01:07:44,475 --> 01:07:46,467
Because I want her
to become somebody.

1027
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,587
Yes, that's what I want for my daughter.

1028
01:07:48,715 --> 01:07:52,834
Am I entitled to feel this way or not?

1029
01:07:52,955 --> 01:07:55,151
She mustn't become a loser.

1030
01:07:55,275 --> 01:07:58,791
She mustn't depend on anyone
or get beaten like me.

1031
01:07:58,915 --> 01:08:01,146
You don't know
what sacrifices I made...

1032
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:04,074
to find the money
to pay for these little things.

1033
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:07,711
I've been running up and down Rome,
keeping it a secret from him...

1034
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:09,986
not to have to touch his money.

1035
01:08:10,115 --> 01:08:11,788
And how does he thank me?

1036
01:08:11,915 --> 01:08:15,067
By beating me to a pulp.
Leave now!

1037
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:18,825
Get out! I can't stand the sight of you.
You've ruined me. Look at me.

1038
01:08:18,955 --> 01:08:21,550
I'm full of bruises.

1039
01:08:21,675 --> 01:08:25,032
I'm full of bruises, look at me.
I'm all swollen.

1040
01:08:26,675 --> 01:08:30,464
Go away.
I can't stand the sight of you.

1041
01:08:32,635 --> 01:08:35,275
He ruined me.

1042
01:08:35,395 --> 01:08:39,947
- Maddalena, stop acting.
- I'm not acting.

1043
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:44,069
Come on, Spartaco.
She's made so many sacrifices.

1044
01:08:44,195 --> 01:08:50,192
She went as far as Piazza Vittoriana
for a diabetic. What more do you want?

1045
01:08:50,315 --> 01:08:55,515
Give her the child.
I'll settle up with you later.

1046
01:08:55,635 --> 01:08:59,072
I don't want to see him again.

1047
01:08:59,195 --> 01:09:03,712
This man will be the death of me.

1048
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:07,272
Give me the child.

1049
01:09:08,715 --> 01:09:10,672
We made it, honey.

1050
01:09:10,795 --> 01:09:13,594
If we didn't do that,
we wouldn't have got an audition.

1051
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:17,072
My dear, do you think
I'm working for nothing?

1052
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:20,233
Cheer up! You have to sing.

1053
01:09:20,355 --> 01:09:21,948
<i>The children...</i>

1054
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:27,070
I've even lost my voice,
but you'll see how I sing tomorrow.

1055
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:28,595
My darling.

1056
01:09:29,555 --> 01:09:30,955
My sweetheart.

1057
01:09:31,595 --> 01:09:33,393
FILMING IN PROCESS

1058
01:09:46,915 --> 01:09:50,795
Quiet, please!

1059
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:57,867
What's he saying?

1060
01:09:59,955 --> 01:10:02,675
It's the voice of director Blasetti.

1061
01:10:03,715 --> 01:10:05,308
I'm going to faint.

1062
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:06,835
Madam.

1063
01:10:09,155 --> 01:10:10,555
She's gone mad.

1064
01:10:39,075 --> 01:10:42,830
Good morning. My daughter is next.

1065
01:10:42,955 --> 01:10:45,311
We're trying to listen here.

1066
01:10:46,555 --> 01:10:48,706
Will you let us listen?

1067
01:10:48,835 --> 01:10:51,225
- What does she want?
- Madam, please.

1068
01:10:51,355 --> 01:10:53,506
If you say so...

1069
01:10:53,635 --> 01:10:57,185
Come over here a minute.
I have to tell you something.

1070
01:10:57,315 --> 01:11:00,467
- I'm going.
- Good.

1071
01:11:13,555 --> 01:11:15,547
I also have to tell you something else.

1072
01:11:16,435 --> 01:11:18,745
All the gifts, the presents...

1073
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,673
All taken care of.

1074
01:11:20,795 --> 01:11:24,232
- Did you send the flowers?
- To Blasetti's wife, of course.

1075
01:11:24,355 --> 01:11:26,153
Because it's important, you see.

1076
01:11:26,275 --> 01:11:28,551
- What about the perfume?
- To the cameraman.

1077
01:11:28,675 --> 01:11:32,271
To the cameraman's wife, actually.
Cigarettes to the cameraman.

1078
01:11:32,395 --> 01:11:37,265
Right. And did you send
a big bunch of flowers?

1079
01:11:37,395 --> 01:11:40,911
Instead of a bunch of normal flowers,
I sent orchids.

1080
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:44,711
They cost more but are more
impressive. You'll see that the gifts work.

1081
01:11:44,835 --> 01:11:47,225
I'm so nervous,
I don't care about anything.

1082
01:11:47,355 --> 01:11:49,711
My heart is in my mouth.
My hands are shaking.

1083
01:11:49,835 --> 01:11:54,227
- Don't faint like that lady.
- I won't. She was a fanatic.

1084
01:11:54,355 --> 01:11:58,144
Who is she? With that funny hairstyle.

1085
01:11:58,275 --> 01:11:59,868
That's Mimmetta.

1086
01:11:59,995 --> 01:12:02,794
- Hi.
- How are you?

1087
01:12:04,355 --> 01:12:05,869
What a rogue you are.

1088
01:12:05,995 --> 01:12:07,987
Did you get the scooter?

1089
01:12:09,315 --> 01:12:11,989
Yes, I did.
So, how are we inaugurating it?

1090
01:12:12,115 --> 01:12:15,267
With a proper launch,
a bottle of champagne.

1091
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:18,433
And maybe even with a patroness.

1092
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:22,352
I don't like ceremonies.

1093
01:12:24,315 --> 01:12:28,628
You know, Alberto, I may have a part
in Colamorucci's next film.

1094
01:12:28,755 --> 01:12:31,827
Glori promised me.

1095
01:12:31,955 --> 01:12:36,029
Well done. Congratulations.

1096
01:12:36,155 --> 01:12:39,353
So now you have to thank me, right?

1097
01:12:39,475 --> 01:12:41,228
Right.

1098
01:12:41,355 --> 01:12:42,994
Mum, I've finished.

1099
01:12:43,115 --> 01:12:46,267
- Yes? How did it go?
- Very well.

1100
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:47,795
Mum!

1101
01:12:59,795 --> 01:13:03,789
Excuse me, Mr. Annovazzi.

1102
01:13:03,915 --> 01:13:08,990
Can I go in? It's my daughter's turn.

1103
01:13:14,995 --> 01:13:19,114
- Let me in.
- How rude.

1104
01:13:19,235 --> 01:13:23,024
There she is.

1105
01:13:23,155 --> 01:13:24,987
She's so pretty.

1106
01:13:25,115 --> 01:13:27,107
That dress really suits her.

1107
01:13:28,755 --> 01:13:31,145
She looks like a hen. See?

1108
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:33,395
Mummy's sweetheart.

1109
01:13:33,515 --> 01:13:39,193
Make up, ready.
You come here.

1110
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:42,706
- What's he telling her?
- Blasetti is explaining to her what to do.

1111
01:13:44,435 --> 01:13:46,233
Does she have to eat that cake?

1112
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:50,554
They're lighting the candles. She has to
blow them out as if it was her birthday.

1113
01:13:50,675 --> 01:13:52,189
- She won't have to eat it?
- No.

1114
01:13:52,315 --> 01:13:54,875
She would have been good at that,
she loves sweets.

1115
01:13:56,555 --> 01:13:58,945
Why is he picking her up?

1116
01:13:59,075 --> 01:14:00,475
She's cute.

1117
01:14:01,635 --> 01:14:04,833
- He kissed her!
- Calm down.

1118
01:14:04,955 --> 01:14:07,390
He kissed my daughter! Did you see?

1119
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:09,313
Well, that's how it is.

1120
01:14:11,275 --> 01:14:13,426
Everything's going to be fine, I'm sure.

1121
01:14:13,555 --> 01:14:16,787
Come to my mother-in-law's restaurant
on Sunday.

1122
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:19,384
And bring along that lady...
what's her name?

1123
01:14:19,515 --> 01:14:22,747
- Mimmetta!
- Yes, the one wearing trousers.

1124
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,753
Your fiancé, I mean.

1125
01:14:25,395 --> 01:14:29,150
You should have seen this child,
she was phenomenal.

1126
01:14:29,275 --> 01:14:33,428
All the spotlights were on her.
I felt as if I was in Piazza Navona.

1127
01:14:33,555 --> 01:14:36,024
And director Blasetti –
he overawed me.

1128
01:14:36,155 --> 01:14:37,874
I couldn't even look at him.

1129
01:14:37,995 --> 01:14:40,385
But she was calm and confident.

1130
01:14:40,515 --> 01:14:43,314
- So calm.
- She's a very calm child.

1131
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:46,951
While you were so agitated,
as if it was your audition.

1132
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:49,670
- Don't be silly.
- But you were shaking.

1133
01:14:49,795 --> 01:14:55,712
Maybe a little. After all, my daughter's
future is at stake here. Right, honey?

1134
01:14:55,835 --> 01:15:00,432
Your medicine! I forget everything
these days. My head is in a spin.

1135
01:15:00,555 --> 01:15:02,308
You have to take this medicine...

1136
01:15:02,435 --> 01:15:05,348
because soon
you have to start working so hard...

1137
01:15:05,475 --> 01:15:09,105
that if you don't get a boost...
What is it? Glycerophosphate...

1138
01:15:09,235 --> 01:15:12,069
- Sodium glycerophosphate.
- It will do you so much good.

1139
01:15:12,195 --> 01:15:16,189
- I don't want it! It tastes nasty!
- Come on.

1140
01:15:16,315 --> 01:15:19,547
If you don't take it, I will.

1141
01:15:19,675 --> 01:15:21,792
- See?
- You know what's going to happen?

1142
01:15:21,915 --> 01:15:24,908
The children who don't take
this medicine turn into geese.

1143
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:27,595
Tomorrow morning,
you'll wake up doing this...

1144
01:15:27,715 --> 01:15:30,594
Come on. Take it.
It tastes like water. Quack quack!

1145
01:15:30,715 --> 01:15:34,311
- I'm taking it.
- You see?

1146
01:15:47,915 --> 01:15:51,306
Did you have to bring this chancer
home with you?

1147
01:15:51,435 --> 01:15:55,145
Don't make such a big deal out of it.
Why are you calling him chancer?

1148
01:15:55,275 --> 01:15:59,269
You're never happy if you're not
arguing with someone, are you?

1149
01:15:59,395 --> 01:16:01,432
Sweet like a cherry.

1150
01:16:01,555 --> 01:16:04,309
You know why I brought him here –
he helped me.

1151
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:07,075
Don't pretend you don't understand.

1152
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:09,471
- Here's the fruit.
- Thanks.

1153
01:16:09,595 --> 01:16:11,109
- Up with Rome!
- Up with Rome!

1154
01:16:11,235 --> 01:16:12,794
Do you support Rome now?

1155
01:16:12,915 --> 01:16:15,555
Gosh! Get out of here.

1156
01:16:15,675 --> 01:16:17,473
What's the world coming to?

1157
01:16:17,595 --> 01:16:21,191
I want him to meet Spartaco
so he can tell you if it's true.

1158
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:22,908
- Mrs. Maddalena!
- Yeah!

1159
01:16:23,035 --> 01:16:26,551
- You don't believe me, you'll believe him.
- Come down to the river!

1160
01:16:26,675 --> 01:16:30,635
- Are you mad?
- You'll see how cool it is here!

1161
01:16:30,755 --> 01:16:35,546
He really is mad.
I can't come because I'm in high heels.

1162
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,792
Don't worry.
I'll give you a hand.

1163
01:16:37,915 --> 01:16:40,589
Listen to me, come up.

1164
01:16:40,715 --> 01:16:44,106
- Are you coming down?
- What a pain! I'm coming then.

1165
01:16:44,235 --> 01:16:48,309
- I'm in high heels, it will be a struggle.
- I'll give you a hand.

1166
01:16:51,515 --> 01:16:54,155
Careful not to hurt yourself.
I'm coming.

1167
01:16:54,275 --> 01:16:56,710
I nearly fell down.

1168
01:16:56,835 --> 01:16:58,235
Here you are.

1169
01:16:58,355 --> 01:17:01,427
You're mad to make me come here
in these heels.

1170
01:17:01,555 --> 01:17:03,547
See how fresh the air is here?

1171
01:17:03,675 --> 01:17:05,667
Fresh air? It's bloody hot here.

1172
01:17:05,795 --> 01:17:07,787
- It's cooler.
- Don't let me fall.

1173
01:17:09,595 --> 01:17:13,350
- Look what lovely greenery and water.
- Where?

1174
01:17:13,475 --> 01:17:15,273
This is nature.

1175
01:17:15,395 --> 01:17:18,706
But we're so used to it. It's no fun at all.

1176
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:22,749
Then why do you stay indoors
all the time? You can walk down here.

1177
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:24,468
It's shady and cool.

1178
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:28,347
Shady and cool?
This is a refuse dump!

1179
01:17:28,475 --> 01:17:30,944
- We're hiding like quails.
- No, no.

1180
01:17:31,075 --> 01:17:33,874
Don't push me down. No tricks.

1181
01:17:35,635 --> 01:17:39,072
- What... Oh, Lord!
- Don't hit me, or you'll fall.

1182
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:42,108
Let me take off my shoe
because it's full of sand.

1183
01:17:42,235 --> 01:17:45,228
Don't push me down there
or I'll take you with me.

1184
01:17:45,355 --> 01:17:47,950
- I'll drag you down with me.
- Fine.

1185
01:17:48,075 --> 01:17:50,670
Let me take off my shoe.

1186
01:17:50,795 --> 01:17:54,789
Heavens! It's full, I'm not lying.
Look.

1187
01:17:54,915 --> 01:17:58,192
- Nice soil.
- I must wash my feet. Hold me, please.

1188
01:17:58,315 --> 01:18:00,432
- I can't believe this.
- I'll hold you.

1189
01:18:01,155 --> 01:18:03,306
Oh, it's so cold.

1190
01:18:04,555 --> 01:18:07,627
Oh, Lord!
I am going to have a heart attack.

1191
01:18:07,755 --> 01:18:10,827
It's lovely here. Almost better
than the Naviglio canal.

1192
01:18:10,955 --> 01:18:12,355
This man is mad.

1193
01:18:12,475 --> 01:18:15,195
- I'm glad you came.
- This is madness.

1194
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:17,307
- I really needed it.
- What?

1195
01:18:17,435 --> 01:18:21,907
- 10 minutes alone with you.
- Really? Why?

1196
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:26,075
Did you want to thank me
for the gift I gave you?

1197
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:29,506
- What are you talking about?
- What's it like? Does it run well?

1198
01:18:31,835 --> 01:18:33,554
How fast can it go?

1199
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:36,190
- I don't understand what...
- Oh, you innocent!

1200
01:18:37,515 --> 01:18:40,587
May I give you a piece of advice?
Look after it.

1201
01:18:40,715 --> 01:18:43,150
You need to get a cover for it
so it won't get wet.

1202
01:18:43,275 --> 01:18:47,064
Because if you ruin it, you won't
find another fool like me ready to buy it.

1203
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,154
I hope you don't think that I...

1204
01:18:53,902 --> 01:18:57,339
- No. I wouldn't dream of it.
- Seriously.

1205
01:18:57,462 --> 01:19:02,059
I don't care how you spent the money.
I knew it from the beginning.

1206
01:19:02,182 --> 01:19:05,971
I was interested in getting
what I wanted.

1207
01:19:06,102 --> 01:19:09,379
Fix your hair, you look dishevelled.

1208
01:19:09,502 --> 01:19:14,133
- You're fun to be with.
- I know, everyone says that.

1209
01:19:14,262 --> 01:19:15,935
I'm just too much fun!

1210
01:19:16,062 --> 01:19:19,658
So, don't be cruel.

1211
01:19:19,782 --> 01:19:22,695
I'm a sweet little angel.

1212
01:19:22,822 --> 01:19:24,302
And I'm also obedient.

1213
01:19:24,422 --> 01:19:27,813
It's so nice in here –
nice lunch, sunshine...

1214
01:19:27,942 --> 01:19:32,380
- All is missing...
- A girl, I know. But you didn't bring her.

1215
01:19:32,502 --> 01:19:35,700
- Mimmetta? She's not my girlfriend.
- Really?

1216
01:19:35,822 --> 01:19:40,135
We dated for a while and we may
get back together, but right now...

1217
01:19:40,262 --> 01:19:43,255
- Did you leave her?
- Me?

1218
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:45,738
I never broke up with anyone.

1219
01:19:45,862 --> 01:19:48,457
- What if I told you it was your fault?
- Here we go.

1220
01:19:50,462 --> 01:19:53,102
- Where do I come into it?
- You do.

1221
01:19:53,902 --> 01:19:57,896
If you want to talk seriously,
we'll talk seriously, if you want to joke...

1222
01:19:58,022 --> 01:20:00,582
- I've seen her twice with you.
- Right.

1223
01:20:00,702 --> 01:20:02,739
- Is she jealous?
- Yes.

1224
01:20:02,862 --> 01:20:04,694
Of me?

1225
01:20:04,822 --> 01:20:07,542
Find a better one.

1226
01:20:07,662 --> 01:20:10,541
A pretty girl like her.
What am I compared to her?

1227
01:20:10,662 --> 01:20:12,415
- Come on.
- Well...

1228
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:14,738
Do you think a girl
can't be jealous of you?

1229
01:20:14,862 --> 01:20:16,342
I'm not saying that, but...

1230
01:20:16,462 --> 01:20:22,459
- Has your husband ever told you...
- Of course he's told me, many times.

1231
01:20:23,302 --> 01:20:25,419
- Let's hope they win.
- Lazio?

1232
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:28,501
- Rome! Let's not fight.
- No, Lazio.

1233
01:20:28,622 --> 01:20:31,296
- Woe betide Rome if they lose.
- Okay, then.

1234
01:20:31,422 --> 01:20:35,052
That's better.
Let me hear what they're saying.

1235
01:20:35,182 --> 01:20:37,492
I can't hear anything from here.

1236
01:20:37,622 --> 01:20:42,094
- That's nice.
- No, that's not nice at all.

1237
01:20:42,222 --> 01:20:44,532
Keep still. Stop it.

1238
01:20:44,662 --> 01:20:47,382
- Who, me?
- You have such a shrewd face!

1239
01:20:47,502 --> 01:20:49,414
- Let's be honest.
- Yes, let's.

1240
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:51,852
I've helped your daughter.

1241
01:20:51,982 --> 01:20:53,974
I've lost my girlfriend.

1242
01:20:54,102 --> 01:20:59,177
You bought a scooter. What more
do you want? Come on!

1243
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,736
Lord, how cunning he is.

1244
01:21:08,262 --> 01:21:10,857
- What a son of a bitch!
- Yeah.

1245
01:21:10,982 --> 01:21:16,296
- I got the scooter I wanted.
- Damn you...

1246
01:21:16,422 --> 01:21:21,053
- Life is great, isn't it?
- Sure. Life is great.

1247
01:21:21,182 --> 01:21:24,016
It could be great,
instead you only live once...

1248
01:21:24,142 --> 01:21:26,976
and life is short and not always good.

1249
01:21:27,102 --> 01:21:29,742
I know that you love your husband...

1250
01:21:29,862 --> 01:21:31,581
and are happy.

1251
01:21:31,702 --> 01:21:34,695
You're happy when
you're with him and the child...

1252
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:38,179
but I also know that today...

1253
01:21:38,302 --> 01:21:40,578
right at this moment...

1254
01:21:40,702 --> 01:21:43,661
we are happy here together.

1255
01:21:43,782 --> 01:21:46,854
Why shouldn't I say so?
It's the truth.

1256
01:21:46,982 --> 01:21:49,975
We understood each other perfectly.

1257
01:21:50,102 --> 01:21:53,937
It's nice here. And I...

1258
01:21:54,062 --> 01:21:56,099
I'd love to hug you.

1259
01:21:56,222 --> 01:22:00,375
Is there anything wrong
in saying so? I don't think so.

1260
01:22:00,502 --> 01:22:02,175
For example, if my mother...

1261
01:22:02,302 --> 01:22:05,500
who's quite old now...

1262
01:22:05,622 --> 01:22:10,014
had let someone hug her
when she was young...

1263
01:22:10,142 --> 01:22:13,101
in the sunshine,
on the riverbank like this...

1264
01:22:13,222 --> 01:22:15,942
instead of tormenting herself
by thinking...

1265
01:22:16,062 --> 01:22:18,657
what my life would be like
as an adult...

1266
01:22:18,782 --> 01:22:22,093
today maybe she'd be less sad.

1267
01:22:22,222 --> 01:22:26,819
She spends her days mending my socks
and washing my shirts.

1268
01:22:28,702 --> 01:22:30,773
My mother.

1269
01:22:30,902 --> 01:22:33,098
Everything that she's given up...

1270
01:22:33,222 --> 01:22:36,374
she's turned it into hopes for me.

1271
01:22:36,502 --> 01:22:38,573
Bless her.

1272
01:22:38,702 --> 01:22:43,379
And now, like Mimmetta, she too
does nothing but say to me all day...

1273
01:22:43,502 --> 01:22:47,257
"Be a go-getter. Be a go-getter."

1274
01:22:48,822 --> 01:22:53,180
I am a go-getter.
You know that very well.

1275
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:57,091
I never pass up any opportunities
that come my way.

1276
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:59,578
I don't live in a dream world.

1277
01:22:59,702 --> 01:23:02,171
But I don't want to have any regrets.

1278
01:23:02,302 --> 01:23:04,817
Am I right, Maddalena?

1279
01:23:04,942 --> 01:23:08,492
Don't make me end my Sunday...

1280
01:23:08,622 --> 01:23:11,820
counting the ants on the sand.

1281
01:23:11,942 --> 01:23:13,934
Listen, Maddalena.

1282
01:23:15,422 --> 01:23:18,460
Have you ever tried
letting yourself go?

1283
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:23,577
Doing one of those silly things
people do just like that...

1284
01:23:23,702 --> 01:23:26,581
once in a while,
without thinking much...

1285
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:31,060
like rich people do
when they throw money away.

1286
01:23:31,182 --> 01:23:34,459
That's the best feeling.

1287
01:23:34,582 --> 01:23:37,177
It spices up our lives.

1288
01:23:37,302 --> 01:23:39,100
It's everything.

1289
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:50,894
Do you know that in this light
your eyes are blue?

1290
01:23:52,182 --> 01:23:55,619
Or maybe green, like the water.

1291
01:23:55,742 --> 01:23:58,541
They change according to the light.

1292
01:23:58,662 --> 01:24:01,382
Now they're very light
and seem to be smiling.

1293
01:24:07,862 --> 01:24:12,414
Come on now, you're talking nonsense.

1294
01:24:16,502 --> 01:24:19,893
Look at this, I'm all dirty now.

1295
01:24:22,342 --> 01:24:26,495
- Why did you stand up?
- Because I have to go.

1296
01:24:26,622 --> 01:24:29,740
Do you want to stay
and count the ants?

1297
01:24:29,862 --> 01:24:32,013
Stay, if that pleases you.

1298
01:24:32,142 --> 01:24:35,453
I can send you my mother-in-law,
so that she can give you a hand.

1299
01:24:35,582 --> 01:24:37,574
Let's go.

1300
01:24:37,702 --> 01:24:39,580
Aren't you coming?

1301
01:24:39,702 --> 01:24:43,537
Or do you want to go in the water,
to cool yourself down?

1302
01:24:47,062 --> 01:24:50,976
Let's go. We need to see
the screen test. Hurry up, come on.

1303
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:57,180
Poor dishevelled fellow.

1304
01:24:57,302 --> 01:24:59,373
It wasn't your lucky day.
Never mind.

1305
01:25:01,782 --> 01:25:04,172
You'll be luckier another time,
don't worry.

1306
01:25:14,822 --> 01:25:16,654
Let me get my jacket.

1307
01:25:21,262 --> 01:25:25,051
If you want to see the screen test,
come to the editing room in Cinecittà.

1308
01:25:25,182 --> 01:25:27,617
- Ask for Iris, okay?
- Yes, thanks a lot.

1309
01:25:27,742 --> 01:25:30,735
Good-bye.
Good-bye everybody.

1310
01:25:38,222 --> 01:25:39,702
Good-bye.

1311
01:25:46,662 --> 01:25:49,177
Did you take your shoes off as well?

1312
01:26:12,622 --> 01:26:15,296
Can I come in?
Is Iris here?

1313
01:26:15,422 --> 01:26:17,254
That's me. Come in.

1314
01:26:19,622 --> 01:26:21,818
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, do come in.

1315
01:26:21,942 --> 01:26:24,537
Mr. Annovazzi told me
to come and see you.

1316
01:26:24,662 --> 01:26:26,858
He mentioned that.
I was expecting you.

1317
01:26:26,982 --> 01:26:28,974
- He said you have the screen tests.
- Yes.

1318
01:26:29,102 --> 01:26:30,502
Of all the girls?

1319
01:26:30,622 --> 01:26:33,262
- Then you have my daughter's too.
- Which one is she?

1320
01:26:33,382 --> 01:26:35,578
- This one here.
- Number 7. It's in the can.

1321
01:26:35,702 --> 01:26:39,173
- What do you mean, in the can?
- To be taken to the viewing room.

1322
01:26:39,302 --> 01:26:41,942
Ah, the film itself. I see.

1323
01:26:42,062 --> 01:26:45,533
- Can I see it then?
- This is a different screen test.

1324
01:26:46,262 --> 01:26:48,254
- Ah, it's another child.
- Right.

1325
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:51,733
It's not very clear.

1326
01:26:52,902 --> 01:26:54,495
She sounds like a cat.

1327
01:26:56,302 --> 01:26:58,453
She gives me the shivers.

1328
01:26:58,582 --> 01:27:01,780
- Can you show me my daughter's now?
- You must be joking.

1329
01:27:01,902 --> 01:27:04,497
Blasetti is waiting for me downstairs.

1330
01:27:04,622 --> 01:27:07,820
Iris, hurry and bring the tests
down as Blasetti is waiting.

1331
01:27:07,942 --> 01:27:10,537
- I'm coming.
- He's angry.

1332
01:27:10,662 --> 01:27:13,018
- Room number 3.
- Okay, bye.

1333
01:27:13,142 --> 01:27:15,737
- Are they watching the screen tests?
- Yes.

1334
01:27:15,862 --> 01:27:18,058
- Including my daughter's?
- Yes.

1335
01:27:18,182 --> 01:27:21,175
- I'm begging you, let me see it.
- Sorry, it's not possible.

1336
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:24,295
- I've come all this way.
- I am going to end up in trouble.

1337
01:27:24,422 --> 01:27:27,335
- But who'll see me?
- Nella, you tell her.

1338
01:27:27,462 --> 01:27:31,376
- Try to understand.
- It's just impossible.

1339
01:27:31,502 --> 01:27:33,300
Hey, do I know you?

1340
01:27:33,422 --> 01:27:35,414
Where have I seen you?

1341
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:37,659
Where have I seen you?
Help me to remember.

1342
01:27:37,782 --> 01:27:40,251
- Tell her. Are you ashamed?
- You saw me in a film.

1343
01:27:40,382 --> 01:27:43,102
That's right. At the outdoor cinema.

1344
01:27:43,222 --> 01:27:47,296
That really nice Roman film...
"Under the Sun of Rome."

1345
01:27:47,422 --> 01:27:48,936
- Yes.
- What a nice film.

1346
01:27:49,062 --> 01:27:51,099
You were the one who got slapped.

1347
01:27:51,222 --> 01:27:53,942
I've enjoyed it so much.
Do you remember her, honey?

1348
01:27:54,062 --> 01:27:56,702
You loved it too.

1349
01:27:56,822 --> 01:27:58,814
What do you do now?
Are you in this film?

1350
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:00,934
No, I don't make films anymore.

1351
01:28:01,062 --> 01:28:05,102
- I work here. I do editing.
- So you don't make films anymore.

1352
01:28:05,222 --> 01:28:06,622
Why?

1353
01:28:06,742 --> 01:28:10,338
I'm not an actress.

1354
01:28:10,462 --> 01:28:13,102
They only hired me once or twice...

1355
01:28:13,222 --> 01:28:15,453
as I was the type they needed.

1356
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:17,574
I even got my hopes up.

1357
01:28:17,702 --> 01:28:21,298
And I lost my job and my boyfriend.

1358
01:28:21,422 --> 01:28:25,575
All I can say is, either you are
a professional actor...

1359
01:28:25,702 --> 01:28:29,013
or give up your dreams
and stick to a real job.

1360
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:32,499
I'm sorry to tell you this,
because you're full of hopes.

1361
01:28:32,622 --> 01:28:36,059
You might be right, but I doubt it.

1362
01:28:36,182 --> 01:28:39,812
So many people ended up badly
thinking they'd make it in cinema.

1363
01:28:39,942 --> 01:28:43,413
I convinced myself I was
so great and so beautiful...

1364
01:28:43,542 --> 01:28:45,932
and yet, I'm stuck here, doing editing.

1365
01:28:46,062 --> 01:28:48,941
Nobody called me, so I'm here.

1366
01:28:51,582 --> 01:28:52,982
Really?

1367
01:28:56,862 --> 01:29:01,653
Poor you. But I'm sure
it's not the same for everyone.

1368
01:29:03,982 --> 01:29:06,133
That would be terrible.

1369
01:29:09,982 --> 01:29:12,417
That would be really terrible.

1370
01:29:12,542 --> 01:29:14,340
Irreparable.

1371
01:29:16,382 --> 01:29:18,772
I risked everything for her.

1372
01:29:22,462 --> 01:29:24,260
I'd be disappointed..

1373
01:29:26,702 --> 01:29:28,500
Don't worry...

1374
01:29:28,622 --> 01:29:30,420
everything will be fine.

1375
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,534
She's so pretty.

1376
01:29:33,542 --> 01:29:36,182
- Did you see the screen test?
- Yes, I did.

1377
01:29:36,302 --> 01:29:37,702
- Is she cute?
- Yes, very.

1378
01:29:37,822 --> 01:29:39,814
Please, let me see it.

1379
01:29:39,942 --> 01:29:42,935
- How can I?
- Let me see it.

1380
01:29:43,062 --> 01:29:46,499
How can I? Nella, what do you say?
Shall I send her up?

1381
01:29:46,622 --> 01:29:49,137
- Why not, give it a try.
- No one will see me.

1382
01:29:49,262 --> 01:29:52,812
I'll stand behind you.
You're so kind.

1383
01:29:55,582 --> 01:29:58,177
I'll take you there,
as long as you stay quiet.

1384
01:29:58,302 --> 01:30:01,101
I won't say a word.
I won't move.

1385
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,496
Thank you.

1386
01:30:11,582 --> 01:30:13,574
It's my daughter's screen test.

1387
01:30:13,702 --> 01:30:16,979
Please let me stay.
You're very kind.

1388
01:30:23,902 --> 01:30:25,894
You see her?

1389
01:30:26,022 --> 01:30:29,413
That's the girl who was
at the photographer's. Remember?

1390
01:30:29,542 --> 01:30:31,534
- Do you see her?
- Yes.

1391
01:30:31,662 --> 01:30:34,655
Quiet, or they'll throw us out.

1392
01:30:38,222 --> 01:30:40,896
- What's her name?
- Maria Cecconi.

1393
01:30:42,942 --> 01:30:46,413
That's you.
Gosh, how small you look from afar.

1394
01:30:53,942 --> 01:30:57,652
What are you doing? Oh, yeah,
you're blowing out the candles.

1395
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:07,061
Blow, blow!

1396
01:31:07,182 --> 01:31:09,492
Poor thing!

1397
01:31:19,142 --> 01:31:21,293
Couldn't you manage?

1398
01:31:21,422 --> 01:31:24,540
You have so much breath at home,
but not there?

1399
01:31:24,662 --> 01:31:26,858
My goodness,
you make me feel ill.

1400
01:31:29,702 --> 01:31:33,059
She really can't do this.

1401
01:31:33,182 --> 01:31:37,222
Stop it, guys!

1402
01:31:37,342 --> 01:31:40,938
I can't work like this.

1403
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:43,258
Guys, please. Enough!

1404
01:31:43,382 --> 01:31:46,773
- Who brought her, Glori?
- Not me.

1405
01:31:46,902 --> 01:31:49,576
- Maybe him, Annovazzi.
- Did you bring her?

1406
01:31:49,702 --> 01:31:54,936
I only directed her here
because her mother asked me.

1407
01:31:55,062 --> 01:31:57,099
Now the poem.

1408
01:31:57,222 --> 01:31:58,781
You recite it so well.

1409
01:31:59,702 --> 01:32:01,978
"Venice, to thee comes at last
the last hour.

1410
01:32:02,102 --> 01:32:04,458
"Martyr illustrious, in thy foe's power.

1411
01:32:04,582 --> 01:32:06,733
"Bread lacks, the cholera deadlier grows.

1412
01:32:06,862 --> 01:32:09,377
"From the lagoon bridge
the white banner blows."

1413
01:32:16,222 --> 01:32:18,214
Did you cry?

1414
01:32:18,342 --> 01:32:20,493
Why did you start crying?

1415
01:32:29,582 --> 01:32:32,142
They're amused, see?

1416
01:32:32,262 --> 01:32:34,731
Perhaps you made them laugh.

1417
01:32:41,302 --> 01:32:44,295
"Venice,
to thee comes at last the last hour..."

1418
01:33:01,702 --> 01:33:04,342
What are they laughing at?

1419
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:08,976
What are they saying?

1420
01:33:09,102 --> 01:33:11,822
Not good things.

1421
01:33:13,502 --> 01:33:15,858
Why are they laughing so much?

1422
01:33:17,382 --> 01:33:19,499
Why are they so amused?

1423
01:33:26,742 --> 01:33:28,620
She's a dwarf, look.

1424
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,534
Bastard.

1425
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:44,174
Bastard.
I can't take this. I can't take this.

1426
01:33:44,302 --> 01:33:49,093
What's all this? Isa, stop the film
and restart it from the beginning.

1427
01:33:49,222 --> 01:33:52,579
- What's so funny?
- She's so funny with that fringe.

1428
01:33:52,702 --> 01:33:56,582
She's not a kid, she's a dwarf –
she went to school with me in 1925!

1429
01:33:56,702 --> 01:33:59,012
- Are you saying you're 30 years old?
- Good.

1430
01:33:59,142 --> 01:34:02,135
- What do you think?
- It's a counter-productive test.

1431
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:03,662
I see.

1432
01:34:03,782 --> 01:34:06,377
Excuse me, but if I may say
my opinion...

1433
01:34:06,502 --> 01:34:08,733
this last screen test is a waste of film.

1434
01:34:08,862 --> 01:34:13,175
I would have realized straight away
that the child was going to do that.

1435
01:34:13,302 --> 01:34:15,942
I have already told you...

1436
01:34:16,062 --> 01:34:20,261
Your name is Annovazzi, isn't it?
You were in the Army, right? Stand up.

1437
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:25,536
Good. By the left.
By the left!

1438
01:34:25,662 --> 01:34:27,494
Quick march. Get out!

1439
01:34:27,622 --> 01:34:29,818
- Go away, because...
- Sorry, Blasetti.

1440
01:34:29,942 --> 01:34:34,733
If you carry on like this, you're out.
I won't be able to hire you anymore.

1441
01:34:34,862 --> 01:34:38,412
- You have no chance.
- At least let me apologize.

1442
01:34:40,142 --> 01:34:43,135
Do I have to lose my job
for such a silly thing?

1443
01:34:43,262 --> 01:34:45,857
- Let me apologize to him.
- I'll do that for you.

1444
01:34:49,462 --> 01:34:52,580
See, Blasetti, I was right.
We wasted time, money and film.

1445
01:34:52,702 --> 01:34:55,342
Time, money, film and health.

1446
01:34:55,462 --> 01:35:00,856
Our health, because we've been looking
non stop for two weeks for this girl.

1447
01:35:00,982 --> 01:35:04,259
And now you tell us that we've wasted
money. Stop it, Filippo!

1448
01:35:04,382 --> 01:35:08,774
You've been laughing until now. Go and
check what's happening over there.

1449
01:35:08,902 --> 01:35:12,816
- No, let me in.
- You can't come in.

1450
01:35:12,942 --> 01:35:15,935
Leave me alone, keep your hands off.

1451
01:35:16,062 --> 01:35:19,339
- Calm down.
- I want to talk to the director.

1452
01:35:19,462 --> 01:35:21,499
- What do you want to say to him?
- What?

1453
01:35:21,622 --> 01:35:25,457
What was so funny about this little girl?
Where is he? There he is.

1454
01:35:25,582 --> 01:35:30,099
Mr. Blasetti, listen...
Let me through. Let me through.

1455
01:35:30,222 --> 01:35:33,135
Excuse me, Mr. Blasetti...

1456
01:35:33,262 --> 01:35:36,175
but I was hiding up there in the booth.

1457
01:35:36,302 --> 01:35:39,056
I've heard you all laugh.
What was so funny?

1458
01:35:39,182 --> 01:35:43,813
Why does she make you laugh
so much? She's like any other child.

1459
01:35:43,942 --> 01:35:46,582
- One of you even called her a dwarf.
- No, no.

1460
01:35:46,702 --> 01:35:51,094
How rude! You've no respect
for other people's feelings.

1461
01:35:51,222 --> 01:35:53,862
You've no respect
for other people's sacrifices.

1462
01:35:53,982 --> 01:35:59,501
I made so many sacrifices
to buy her this dress...

1463
01:35:59,622 --> 01:36:03,616
- Calm down, madam.
- And the other guy, that Annovazzi...

1464
01:36:03,742 --> 01:36:06,177
- Where is he?
- We've thrown him out.

1465
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:10,342
Well done. You're a person who
understands. You did the right thing.

1466
01:36:10,462 --> 01:36:13,534
- Let me speak.
- Well done to you.

1467
01:36:13,662 --> 01:36:18,020
How can we tell if someone
is hiding in the projection booth?

1468
01:36:18,142 --> 01:36:22,056
Mr. Blasetti, please,
don't send me away like this...

1469
01:36:22,182 --> 01:36:24,742
without a glimmer of hope.

1470
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:27,457
You see, Antonelli?
This is cinema.

1471
01:36:27,582 --> 01:36:30,700
We're responsible for all this.
Glori, come here.

1472
01:36:30,822 --> 01:36:33,781
We can't deal
with the mothers too.

1473
01:36:33,902 --> 01:36:38,055
- Isa, put reel number 7 back on.
- The one with Maria Cecconi.

1474
01:36:38,182 --> 01:36:40,572
I want to see the test again.
Do you want to go?

1475
01:36:40,702 --> 01:36:44,935
- No, I'll watch it again too.
- I'm pleased.

1476
01:36:45,062 --> 01:36:47,452
The dwarf in the land of the giants.

1477
01:36:47,582 --> 01:36:50,177
Blasetti, remember that I'm a Northerner.

1478
01:36:50,302 --> 01:36:52,419
I come from Milan,
I never go to Donei's.

1479
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:55,182
- You can get good deals there.
- Do you go to Motta's?

1480
01:36:55,302 --> 01:36:56,702
Quiet now, please.

1481
01:36:56,822 --> 01:36:59,621
"Today, tomorrow and never"
Seventh screen test.

1482
01:39:22,622 --> 01:39:24,420
Help!

1483
01:39:57,182 --> 01:40:02,302
Annovazzi! Alberto, wait for me.
Stop.

1484
01:40:02,422 --> 01:40:05,221
We need to find that child
who did the screen test.

1485
01:40:05,342 --> 01:40:07,902
The one that made us laugh.
What was her name?

1486
01:40:08,022 --> 01:40:10,014
- Cecconi.
- Yes, Cecconi.

1487
01:40:10,142 --> 01:40:12,134
Blasetti wants her.

1488
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:15,061
Blasetti kicked me out,
it's no longer my business.

1489
01:40:15,182 --> 01:40:17,378
Don't be stupid.

1490
01:40:17,502 --> 01:40:21,382
- We must find her.
- You find her. I'll give you the address.

1491
01:40:21,502 --> 01:40:23,380
It's Via Alberto da Giussano, 4.
Bye.

1492
01:40:23,502 --> 01:40:26,574
If you find her, and if we sign
the contract this evening...

1493
01:40:26,702 --> 01:40:29,012
you'll work on this film, I promise you.

1494
01:40:29,142 --> 01:40:31,941
- Swear.
- I swear. I give you my word.

1495
01:40:32,062 --> 01:40:35,373
She lives in Prenestino,
via Alberto da Giussano, 4.

1496
01:40:35,502 --> 01:40:37,698
I'll go ahead, you take the car.

1497
01:40:37,822 --> 01:40:41,338
Da Giussano, 4? I'm off.
Orsini, hurry. You go. Orsini!

1498
01:40:41,462 --> 01:40:45,581
The contract is ready and signed by the
producer. All we need is your approval.

1499
01:40:45,702 --> 01:40:48,422
- We have the best actors, like...
- Amedeo Nazzari.

1500
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:52,172
- And that American actress...
- Lana Turner. If not her, a better one.

1501
01:40:52,302 --> 01:40:53,702
Absolutely.

1502
01:40:53,822 --> 01:40:57,657
Maybe he's not interested in this
because he's worried about his wife.

1503
01:40:57,782 --> 01:41:00,616
Don't worry, your wife will be back.
She's not a child.

1504
01:41:00,742 --> 01:41:04,895
Are you worried? I'll take care of that.
The police and us are very close.

1505
01:41:05,022 --> 01:41:07,014
Orsini, go straight to Via Genova...

1506
01:41:07,142 --> 01:41:09,338
and talk to Superintendent Giusillo.

1507
01:41:09,462 --> 01:41:10,896
Tell him Glori sent you...

1508
01:41:11,022 --> 01:41:13,014
and that I need a favour.

1509
01:41:13,142 --> 01:41:16,658
- They even find people who drown.
- Forget about the police.

1510
01:41:16,782 --> 01:41:18,182
He's right.

1511
01:41:18,302 --> 01:41:22,012
My wife will be here soon. She always
wants to do things her own way.

1512
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:24,213
I'd really like to know where she's gone.

1513
01:41:24,342 --> 01:41:27,062
I've asked somebody to let me know
when she arrives.

1514
01:41:27,182 --> 01:41:28,582
Take a seat.

1515
01:41:28,702 --> 01:41:31,774
- Orsini, you can go.
- We can discuss the contract.

1516
01:41:31,902 --> 01:41:35,054
Fine. So...

1517
01:41:35,182 --> 01:41:39,176
"With this private agreement,
we hire Maria Cecconi...

1518
01:41:39,302 --> 01:41:41,419
"as the leading young actress..."

1519
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:44,979
Spartaco.
She's here, come up.

1520
01:41:45,102 --> 01:41:48,300
She's here.

1521
01:41:51,222 --> 01:41:54,294
After all you've done, you made it.

1522
01:41:55,302 --> 01:41:57,897
Stand back. Don't touch her.

1523
01:41:59,222 --> 01:42:01,976
- Don't touch her.
- Maddalena.

1524
01:42:02,102 --> 01:42:05,618
Hi, Spartaco. Don't wake her up.

1525
01:42:07,062 --> 01:42:08,576
Don't wake her up.

1526
01:42:08,702 --> 01:42:10,534
Let me through.

1527
01:42:13,422 --> 01:42:15,414
Don't touch her.

1528
01:42:16,142 --> 01:42:19,533
- Thank goodness she's here.
- Her husband was waiting for her.

1529
01:42:19,662 --> 01:42:23,338
- Her eyes are red.
- She's been crying.

1530
01:42:27,582 --> 01:42:30,302
What's going on, Maddalena?

1531
01:42:30,422 --> 01:42:32,618
You made it.

1532
01:42:32,742 --> 01:42:35,257
For once you're right,
and you start crying!

1533
01:42:35,382 --> 01:42:38,022
Let's sign this contract.

1534
01:42:38,142 --> 01:42:39,815
We don't have many options.

1535
01:42:39,942 --> 01:42:43,572
Either we sign that contract
or we end up in the street.

1536
01:42:44,462 --> 01:42:46,260
She's crying again.

1537
01:42:46,382 --> 01:42:48,897
Here she is, our Greta Garbo.

1538
01:42:50,982 --> 01:42:52,780
Don't you dare touch her.

1539
01:42:53,422 --> 01:42:55,539
Don't touch her.

1540
01:42:55,662 --> 01:42:59,372
Come on, let's sign the contract.
We just need one signature.

1541
01:42:59,502 --> 01:43:01,937
And I'll give you 250,000 lire
immediately.

1542
01:43:02,062 --> 01:43:05,294
A further 250,000 in a week,
and more in two weeks.

1543
01:43:05,422 --> 01:43:08,415
I'll give you the first instalment
straight away.

1544
01:43:08,542 --> 01:43:11,341
Where's the cheque book?
Do you have it, Alberto? No.

1545
01:43:11,462 --> 01:43:14,261
It must be at Cinecittà.
I'll be right back to pay you.

1546
01:43:14,382 --> 01:43:17,932
It's two million lire.
You're going to get two million.

1547
01:43:18,062 --> 01:43:20,657
Plus a thousand lire a day
that no one can take away.

1548
01:43:20,782 --> 01:43:24,981
Don't turn your back on this,
it only happens once.

1549
01:43:25,102 --> 01:43:27,219
Please, just sign it.

1550
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:30,295
Very well.

1551
01:43:31,822 --> 01:43:36,294
Do you want her with curly hair
or straight hair?

1552
01:43:36,422 --> 01:43:40,541
Does she have to lisp or stutter?
Which one do you find funnier?

1553
01:43:40,662 --> 01:43:44,542
Haven't you had enough fun,
all of you?

1554
01:43:44,662 --> 01:43:46,733
I'm really sorry...

1555
01:43:46,862 --> 01:43:49,218
but my daughter is staying here.

1556
01:43:49,342 --> 01:43:52,779
I didn't bring her into this world
to amuse anyone.

1557
01:43:52,902 --> 01:43:56,134
To me and to her dad she's beautiful.

1558
01:43:58,182 --> 01:44:00,492
She's beautiful.

1559
01:44:01,422 --> 01:44:03,618
We're keeping her here.

1560
01:44:07,342 --> 01:44:10,062
Go now, or you will wake her up.

1561
01:44:10,182 --> 01:44:12,174
Go away.

1562
01:44:16,422 --> 01:44:19,893
Spartaco, what are you waiting for
to tell these gentlemen...

1563
01:44:20,022 --> 01:44:22,935
that your daughter
will never make films?

1564
01:44:23,062 --> 01:44:25,657
Kick them out.

1565
01:44:25,782 --> 01:44:28,013
Kick them out, Spartaco.

1566
01:44:28,142 --> 01:44:30,259
Kick them out.

1567
01:44:33,582 --> 01:44:37,576
Maddalena!
Maddalena, can you hear me?

1568
01:44:39,502 --> 01:44:43,018
I don't think there's much we can do.
I know her very well.

1569
01:44:43,142 --> 01:44:47,136
Take the contract
and go back to Cinecittà. I'm sorry.

1570
01:44:47,262 --> 01:44:50,141
What are you doing?
You're always a nuisance.

1571
01:44:50,262 --> 01:44:52,982
Really? We're always a nuisance?

1572
01:44:53,102 --> 01:44:56,379
What about you,
with all the racket you make?

1573
01:44:56,502 --> 01:44:59,973
I'm the concierge. Don't I have the right
to tell these ladies...

1574
01:45:00,102 --> 01:45:03,140
what goes on in the building
where I work?

1575
01:45:03,262 --> 01:45:06,061
- Am I right or not?
- Be quiet. The child's sleeping.

1576
01:45:06,182 --> 01:45:09,573
- Be quiet.
- Let's go because the child's sleeping.

1577
01:45:09,702 --> 01:45:12,297
Do me a favour
and take these cows away.

1578
01:45:12,422 --> 01:45:14,459
Are we cows now?

1579
01:45:14,582 --> 01:45:17,654
Quiet. My daughter is asleep.
Go away.

1580
01:45:17,782 --> 01:45:19,899
Go away.

1581
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:22,412
What are you doing still here?
Go away.

1582
01:45:22,542 --> 01:45:26,013
You'd better stop it,
or I'll send down my husband.

1583
01:45:26,142 --> 01:45:29,453
Send whoever – your grandfather,
your uncle... Just go away!

1584
01:45:29,582 --> 01:45:31,972
How rude!

1585
01:45:34,342 --> 01:45:37,619
How will I look in front
of the producer and everyone else?

1586
01:45:37,742 --> 01:45:42,055
And Orsini, who's got the car, has left.
How do we get back to Cinecittà?

1587
01:45:42,182 --> 01:45:44,219
I'll give you a lift on my scooter.

1588
01:45:52,102 --> 01:45:53,502
Let's go.

1589
01:45:53,622 --> 01:45:57,377
- Good night.
- Good night, or rather, good-bye.

1590
01:45:58,982 --> 01:46:00,575
Good-bye.

1591
01:46:01,782 --> 01:46:04,013
Good-bye.

1592
01:46:04,142 --> 01:46:05,940
Good-bye.

1593
01:46:17,062 --> 01:46:21,261
That damned outdoor cinema.
Always disturbing us.

1594
01:46:35,302 --> 01:46:37,373
My poor little house.

1595
01:46:38,542 --> 01:46:41,137
My poor little house,
what's going to happen now?

1596
01:47:27,062 --> 01:47:29,179
Give me my usual four slaps.

1597
01:47:30,302 --> 01:47:33,340
Give them to me
so that you'll feel better. Go on.

1598
01:47:33,462 --> 01:47:35,454
What are you waiting for, Spartaco?

1599
01:48:04,862 --> 01:48:08,936
This crazy wife of mine.

1600
01:48:10,942 --> 01:48:13,537
Don't worry about the house.

1601
01:48:13,662 --> 01:48:17,053
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I'll pay for everything.

1602
01:48:17,182 --> 01:48:19,538
Even if I had to kill myself with work.

1603
01:48:19,662 --> 01:48:22,734
Even if I had to get everyone
in Rome to develop diabetes.

1604
01:48:22,862 --> 01:48:25,093
Don't worry, Spartaco.

1605
01:48:25,222 --> 01:48:27,134
Don't worry.

1606
01:48:29,422 --> 01:48:31,414
- Can you hear him?
- Who?

1607
01:48:31,542 --> 01:48:35,297
Burt Lancaster. He's so nice.

1608
01:48:35,422 --> 01:48:38,415
Maddalena,
now you really deserve a slap!

1609
01:48:38,542 --> 01:48:41,341
Am I not allowed a joke anymore?

1610
01:48:48,942 --> 01:48:51,935
Quiet, don't talk,
don't wake the child up.

1611
01:48:52,062 --> 01:48:54,258
Don't wake the child up.

1612
01:49:27,702 --> 01:49:31,173
