00:00:58:<i>Emily!</i>
00:03:02:You're the medical examiner?
00:03:28:Mr. Rose?
00:04:28:I'm sorry, Mr. Rose...
00:04:31:...but I cannot state conclusively...
00:04:34:...that the cause of death|was natural.
00:04:40:Your daughter, she...
00:04:57:Excuse me, Father?
00:05:00:Father Moore.
00:05:03:You'll have to come with me.
00:05:14:- Father Moore!|- Will you plead guilty?
00:05:16:- Tell us about the exorcism!|- Over here, Father Moore!
00:05:19:We're at Crescent County Courthouse.|We show you Father Richard Moore...
00:05:23:<i>- What about the parents?|- They're not talking to the police. </i>
00:05:25:<i>Do we charge them?</i>
00:05:27:<i>No. Even the priest admits|he ran the show. </i>
00:05:29:<i>We need a Christian on this. </i>
00:05:31:Preferably a Catholic.
00:05:32:Somebody that knows this shit|inside out...
00:05:35:...and who the public will see|as unbiased.
00:05:39:We're going after a holy man here.
00:05:42:Ethan Thomas.
00:05:45:He's not Catholic, though.|Methodist, I think.
00:05:49:But the guy practically lives at church.|Choir, teaches Sunday school.
00:05:52:He's no choirboy in the courtroom.|I've seen him tear people up.
00:05:56:He's a shrewd son of a bitch.
00:06:02:All right, pull him off whatever|he's doing. He's lead prosecutor.
00:06:26:There's ambition. She never stops.|She even works while she drinks.
00:06:30:- Gentlemen, you know Erin Bruner.|- Of course.
00:06:32:- Hello.|- I was so sure Van Hopper would fry...
00:06:35:...but you proved me wrong, lady.
00:06:38:The system worked, that's all.
00:06:41:Gentlemen, you'll excuse us,|will you?
00:06:44:Have you seen the news|about this priest?
00:06:46:I heard something about an exorcism|gone bad, but I don't know the details.
00:06:49:The DA charged him|with negligent homicide.
00:06:52:They offered a very reasonable plea|bargain, but the priest turned it down.
00:06:56:Do not ask me to take this...
00:06:57:The archdiocese|specifically requested you.
00:07:01:- Why me?|- They followed the Van Hopper trial.
00:07:04:They think you're smart...
00:07:06:...and convincing.
00:07:08:They want you to ask the priest|to reconsider.
00:07:10:Well, what if he won't?
00:07:12:This sounds like a quagmire.|If I'm smart, I'll leave it alone.
00:07:16:Erin, the Van Hopper case|got you back on the fast track.
00:07:19:Once again, you're a rising star.
00:07:21:- Chivas, neat, please.|- Tanqueray martini, dry.
00:07:26:- What are you saying?|- I'm saying, you do this for me...
00:07:29:...and the rising star keeps rising.
00:07:32:The case is yours.
00:07:36:And just how high|do I get to rise this time?
00:07:41:I've been junior partner|for too long now, Karl.
00:07:44:- It's not like other firms haven't called.|- Erin...
00:07:46:I want my name on the door,|right next to yours.
00:07:53:Okay.
00:07:55:Try to get the deal.
00:07:56:If the priest won't|and this goes to trial...
00:07:58:...the archdiocese feels he could|be an embarrassment.
00:08:01:So under no circumstances|is he to testify.
00:08:03:No, of course.|If I'd put Van Hopper on the stand...
00:08:06:...he'd be marking time on death row|instead of sunbathing in Miami.
00:08:10:His tab.
00:08:37:Good morning, I'm Erin Bruner.
00:08:40:May I sit down?
00:08:43:They brought the chair|for my public defender.
00:08:48:I guess they left it when they decided|I wasn't going to kill myself with it.
00:09:01:My firm represents the archdiocese.
00:09:06:Yes.
00:09:08:Yes, I was expecting them|to send someone.
00:09:12:- Why did they choose you?|- I wanted this case.
00:09:15:- So you like the spotlight?|- I'm used to it.
00:09:18:I defended James Van Hopper.
00:09:20:And now you've come|to further your celebrity.
00:09:23:No.
00:09:25:I'm here to make senior partner|at my firm.
00:09:30:- Are you a Catholic?|- No.
00:09:33:I'm an agnostic, I guess.|I'm not really sure.
00:09:37:If you're not sure, then you are one.
00:09:41:I don't think you're the right attorney.|I'll stick with my public defender.
00:09:44:He can't get the DA|to get you a better deal. I can.
00:09:47:I won't be making|any plea agreement.
00:09:49:If you don't, the archdiocese|won't post your bail.
00:09:52:You'll be stuck in here for the trial.
00:09:57:Do you understand how long|they can put you away?
00:09:59:It's been explained to me.
00:10:00:The DA's office doesn't like it when|religion holds itself above the law.
00:10:04:And this prosecutor,|Ethan Thomas?
00:10:06:You're gonna need somebody|hungry and smart...
00:10:09:...and aggressive|to even have a chance.
00:10:11:What would your strategy be to defend|me against such a formidable man?
00:10:15:- That depends.|- On what?
00:10:17:On how you wanna be defended.
00:10:23:What's your main concern,|other than staying out of jail?
00:10:27:- Is it how you're being portrayed?|- I don't care about my reputation.
00:10:31:I'm not afraid of jail.
00:10:35:What I care about|is telling Emily Rose's story.
00:10:39:I want people to hear|what only I can tell.
00:10:42:And what is that?
00:10:44:What really happened to Emily...
00:10:46:...and why.
00:10:51:If I let you defend me...
00:10:54:...will you promise to let me testify and|tell the truth about what happened?
00:10:58:And what is the truth you would tell?|That the ritual killed her?
00:11:03:- Was it your fault she died?|- No.
00:11:06:All right.|Then I'll let you tell her story.
00:11:08:But only if you agree to let me do|whatever else it takes to win.
00:11:31:You're not used to|this kind of place.
00:11:34:I'm sure our life is very strange|to you.
00:11:40:Not so strange.
00:11:43:I grew up in a little town.
00:11:46:But our house wasn't as nice|or as big as this.
00:11:49:My mother, she raised me alone.
00:11:51:She was a schoolteacher,|so we had very little money.
00:11:54:What a wonderful thing to be.
00:11:57:That was Emily's dream,|to be a teacher.
00:12:00:That's why she went away|to the university.
00:12:11:A lot of cats live here.
00:12:15:There are...
00:12:17:...11 now, I think.
00:12:20:Emily always brought them home.
00:12:22:Ever since she was a little girl,|she couldn't leave a stray abandoned.
00:12:30:Before these troubles began...
00:12:33:...was Emily a happy girl?
00:12:35:Oh, yes.
00:12:37:Before she went away|to university...
00:12:40:...my Emily was so very happy.
00:12:45:What is going on..? Girls!
00:12:51:Mama.
00:12:55:Is it..?
00:12:57:It's a scholarship, Mama.
00:13:00:They pay for it.|They pay for everything.
00:13:04:This is your dream, Emily.
00:13:07:You'll be leaving us.
00:13:11:It's okay.
00:13:14:I'll be okay.
00:13:17:I'm gonna show this to your father.
00:13:28:- Counselor. Thanks for meeting me.|- Sure.
00:13:32:Can I buy you a drink, Mr. Thomas?|He makes an excellent martini.
00:13:36:Just water for me, please.
00:13:38:So...
00:13:40:...the judge thinks we should offer|a new plea agreement.
00:13:43:She feels the community might be|better served without this trial.
00:13:47:How do you feel about it?
00:13:49:Personally.
00:13:52:My job is to represent|the interests of the people...
00:13:54:...and make an effort to be objective.
00:13:58:I ask because I know|you're a churchgoer.
00:14:00:Now you're set to prosecute|a man of God.
00:14:03:Your priest broke the law...
00:14:05:...and a young girl is dead.
00:14:08:If he's a man of God, then, personally,|I think he's even more subject...
00:14:11:...to the laws of moral behavior.|If it were up to me, he'd get no deal.
00:14:15:And forgiveness and compassion?|Isn't that part of your creed?
00:14:19:Or does that just get in the way|of your work?
00:14:24:If you have compassion|for your client...
00:14:27:...you'll persuade him to accept this:
00:14:29:Charges reduced|to reckless endangerment.
00:14:32:Twelve months in a county jail.
00:14:34:Reducible to six, plus probation,|if he stays out of trouble.
00:14:37:Somehow I expect|he can manage that.
00:14:39:But please understand me.|If he refuses, I will seek the maximum.
00:14:43:Father Moore has made it clear|there will be no plea agreement.
00:14:46:He will not lie or admit to something|he is not guilty of.
00:14:49:- And he was never neglectful of Emily.|- "Never neglectful"?
00:14:53:Have you seen|the postmortem photographs?
00:14:59:We'll go to trial. My client wants|the public to know the truth.
00:15:03:Good.
00:15:06:So do I.
00:15:10:Have a good night, counselor.
00:16:21:Let the record show that the defendant|and his counsel are present...
00:16:25:...and that the jury is seated.
00:16:27:- Mr. Thomas, you may begin.|- Thank you, Your Honor.
00:16:31:Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.|My name is Ethan Thomas.
00:16:34:I'm the assistant district attorney,|and I represent the people.
00:16:38:In the case before you,|the evidence will show...
00:16:41:...that the victim had a serious medical|condition that demanded treatment.
00:16:46:We will prove that the victim's|condition rendered her physically...
00:16:50:...and psychologically incapable|of caring for herself.
00:16:55:Her care...
00:16:57:...was then wholly entrusted...
00:16:59:...to that man, the defendant,|Father Richard Moore.
00:17:03:She became his responsibility...
00:17:07:...and he betrayed|that responsibility...
00:17:10:...by persuading her to abandon|her medical treatment...
00:17:12:...in favor of religious treatment:
00:17:16:A ritual exorcism,|performed by the defendant...
00:17:19:...allegedly to cure the victim|by ridding her of demonic forces.
00:17:25:We will demonstrate|that this course of action...
00:17:29:...directly resulted|in the victim's death.
00:17:33:I said a moment ago|that I represent the people.
00:17:35:We all know what that means,|but it's a little abstract, isn't it?
00:17:39:Miss Bruner,|the attorney for the defense...
00:17:41:...is seated right next|to the man she represents.
00:17:44:And I stand here|to represent the people.
00:17:49:That's not really why|I stand here today.
00:17:52:I'm here on behalf of someone|who can't sit at a table...
00:17:57:...and look at you every day|and gain your sympathy...
00:18:01:...someone who can't take the stand|to testify...
00:18:04:...and tell you what happened|in her own words.
00:18:09:A young girl...
00:18:11:...that could've been your daughter.
00:18:14:Could've been mine.
00:18:16:A girl who trusted|Father Richard Moore with her life.
00:18:26:This is what she looked like...
00:18:31:...before the defendant began|his religious treatment.
00:18:38:This is a photograph taken of her|on the day that she died.
00:18:56:I stand here for Emily Rose...
00:19:02:...who died horribly...
00:19:05:...at age 19.
00:19:09:You won't be able to see Emily sitting|here day after day during this trial.
00:19:14:But I hope you'll remember her|as she was when she was alive...
00:19:18:...and full of...
00:19:21:...hopes and dreams.
00:19:26:And as she was when Father|Richard Moore was finished with her...
00:19:31:...and left her to die.
00:19:36:Thank you.
00:19:38:Is the defense prepared|to make its opening statement?
00:19:45:I'd like to reserve|my opening statement...
00:19:47:...until the presentation|of the defense's case.
00:19:49:As is your privilege.
00:19:52:Prosecution may begin.
00:19:54:That was already my plan.
00:19:56:Thank you, Your Honor.|The people call Dr. Edith Vogel.
00:19:59:I've known Emily her entire life.|I took care of all of the Rose girls.
00:20:04:Can you describe Emily|as you knew her growing up?
00:20:07:She was a bit sickly|in her early years.
00:20:09:She stayed inside a lot,|reading, learning music.
00:20:14:How did she feel about|going to school?
00:20:16:Objection.|The witness is not a psychiatrist.
00:20:18:I'll rephrase. Did you talk to Emily|about going off to college?
00:20:22:Yes. She told me she was excited...
00:20:25:...but nervous that she would be away|from her family in the big city.
00:20:29:This was an overwhelming change|for her.
00:20:31:Did you stay in touch|after she went away?
00:20:33:Yes. She wrote me a letter|saying that she'd been to a dance...
00:20:39:...and she'd met a boy|named Jason.
00:20:41:She didn't want her mother|to know this...
00:20:44:...because her mother did not|approve of dancing...
00:20:46:...and had warned her|about the boys at school.
00:20:49:Did Emily communicate with you again|last fall after you received the letter?
00:20:52:Actually, it was her mother.
00:20:57:She telephoned me...
00:20:58:...waking me out of a deep sleep|at 4 in the morning.
00:21:02:<i>She asked me to call Emily at|a payphone on the university campus. </i>
00:21:10:<i>When Emily answered,|she was quite hysterical. </i>
00:21:15:<i>At first, she just|sobbed uncontrollably. </i>
00:21:18:<i>But eventually she calmed down|enough to tell me what happened. </i>
00:21:24:<i>She said that she was alone|that weekend. </i>
00:21:26:<i>Her roommate had gone home. </i>
00:21:33:<i>She had awakened... </i>
00:21:36:<i>... and thought she smelled|something burning. </i>
00:21:40:<i>There was no alarm,|but she got up... </i>
00:21:43:<i>... afraid there was a fire. </i>
00:24:50:<i>Dr. Mueller, what's your position|at the university hospital?</i>
00:24:53:I am chairman of|the Department of Neurology.
00:24:56:And after you heard|about the dorm-room incident...
00:24:58:...what were your initial thoughts?
00:25:00:At first, I thought perhaps|Emily had taken illegal drugs.
00:25:03:Some type of hallucinogen.
00:25:05:But we ran tests and found no trace|of drugs in her system.
00:25:09:And the more she explained|the incident to me...
00:25:12:...the more I began to suspect|something else.
00:25:15:Epilepsy results from uncontrolled|electrical activity in the brain.
00:25:21:<i>In a severe, or grand mal, seizure... </i>
00:25:23:<i>... a person may lose consciousness|for several minutes... </i>
00:25:25:<i>... and suffer involuntary contractions|of all the muscles of the body. </i>
00:25:29:<i>Is it possible for a person|suffering such a seizure... </i>
00:25:32:<i>... to have hallucinations or perceive|the things that Emily described?</i>
00:25:35:<i>The muscle contractions could feel|like an extreme pressure on the body. </i>
00:25:39:<i>And it is certainly possible,|with all that brain activity... </i>
00:25:42:...for a person to perceive all sorts|of strange and violent things.
00:25:47:So suspecting that Emily was|epileptic, how did you proceed?
00:25:50:I administered|an electroencephalograph.
00:25:52:What did the EEG reveal?
00:25:54:It showed a possible epileptic focus|in the patient's left temporal lobe.
00:25:58:Did this require|a specific treatment?
00:26:00:Yes, I began a medication schedule|for Emily with the drug Gambutrol.
00:26:04:I also advised regular follow-up|examinations and further tests.
00:26:08:But Emily failed to keep|her follow-up appointments with me.
00:26:12:She give any reason for discontinuing|these appointments?
00:26:14:Yes, she told me she was convinced|that her condition was a spiritual one.
00:26:18:It was the conviction of her priest,|she said, and she shared his beliefs.
00:26:23:Was it your impression|that Emily had placed her care...
00:26:26:...entirely..?|- Leading the witness.
00:26:28:Sustained.
00:26:32:After the end of October...
00:26:33:...did you ask Emily|why she had stopped...
00:26:36:...filling her Gambutrol|prescriptions?
00:26:38:Yes. She said that Father Moore had|suggested she stop taking the drug.
00:26:42:And what, in your medical opinion...
00:26:44:...was the result|of Father Moore's suggestion?
00:26:47:I believe Father Moore's suggestion|killed her.
00:26:49:Objection, Your Honor!
00:26:51:The witness is asserting outrageous|conclusions based on pure hearsay.
00:26:55:Technically correct, but I'll allow it|as part of his expert opinion testimony.
00:26:59:Thank you, Dr. Mueller.
00:27:01:Your witness.
00:27:03:You said you observed a possible|epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.
00:27:08:Doesn't this imply what you observed|may not have been an epileptic focus?
00:27:12:Yes, that's also possible.
00:27:13:Would Father Moore's advice to stop|taking Gambutrol be good advice...
00:27:17:...if Emily were, in fact,|not epileptic?
00:27:19:Of course. But that's not|the case here. She was epileptic.
00:27:23:Really.
00:27:25:When Emily saw objects move|on their own...
00:27:28:...and felt an invisible presence|on top of her...
00:27:31:...was she experiencing symptoms|typical of epilepsy?
00:27:34:Not typical, no.
00:27:35:Are they typical indications|of any other conditions?
00:27:38:- Say, for example, psychosis?|- Yes, I would say that's correct.
00:27:42:But isn't psychosis an entirely different|medical condition from epilepsy?
00:27:47:- Yes, in my...|- So aren't you selectively choosing...
00:27:49:...what parts of Emily's experiences|fit your epilepsy diagnosis...
00:27:52:...while ignoring those which|indicate something else?
00:27:55:- Objection. Argumentative.|- Withdrawn.
00:27:58:No further questions.
00:28:33:We have to work fast.
00:28:35:They're only giving me an hour|with you tonight.
00:28:38:Listen.
00:28:40:Before we get started,|there's something I have to tell you...
00:28:43:...something I should've said to you|before I let you take the case.
00:28:47:Okay.
00:28:51:There are forces|surrounding this trial.
00:28:55:Dark, powerful forces.
00:28:59:Just be careful, Erin.|Watch your step.
00:29:04:I see.
00:29:08:Look...
00:29:11:Father, you don't have to worry|about me.
00:29:13:I'm an agnostic, remember?
00:29:15:Demons exist,|whether you believe in them or not.
00:29:18:Your involvement in this trial might|just open you up to their attacks.
00:29:23:Look, Father,|I appreciate your concern...
00:29:26:...but you need to be worried|about yourself.
00:29:29:Ethan Thomas is using the medical|aspects of this case as ammunition...
00:29:32:...and I have to be prepared|for his attacks, so...
00:29:36:...with what little time we have, I think|we need to focus on your defense.
00:29:54:Now, what I need from you is more|information about Emily's condition.
00:29:58:Specific details of how it progressed|after the dorm-room episode.
00:30:02:Well, after the first incident...
00:30:05:...she was sent to the university|hospital for testing and observation.
00:30:46:Emily once told me that in her|dorm room, she resisted the demons...
00:30:51:...but at the hospital|they overcame her.
00:30:54:So she believed...
00:30:55:...that her possession|began at the hospital?
00:30:59:Yeah, I think she did.
00:31:02:And after that, things just went|from bad to worse.
00:33:08:Emily!
00:33:49:Emily?
00:34:21:Oh, my God. Emily?
00:34:25:Don't touch me.
00:34:34:Jason, please...
00:34:38:...don't leave me.
00:34:48:<i>And I never did leave her. </i>
00:34:50:<i>I stayed until the end. </i>
00:34:54:So much of what we shared|was like a nightmare...
00:34:58:...but I wouldn't give up|a single minute I spent with her.
00:35:03:She woke me up, you know?
00:35:06:To things I never felt before,|things I never knew I could feel.
00:35:12:I never knew how dead I was|until I met her.

00:41:05:Counsel Bruner, my courtroom day|begins at 9:30 a. m.
00:41:09:- I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...|- Which was 17 minutes ago.
00:41:15:Ready to proceed?
00:41:18:Yes, Your Honor.
00:41:19:Dr. Briggs, please state|your qualifications for the court.
00:41:22:I have advanced degrees|in medicine...
00:41:24:...psychiatry and neurology|from Johns Hopkins...
00:41:27:...and I have had three books|and several dozen papers published...
00:41:32:...in the fields of neurology|and neuropsychiatry.
00:41:35:What was the cause of death,|as determined by the autopsy?
00:41:38:The decedent expired due to a gradual|shutdown of the bodily functions.
00:41:43:Why did her body shut down?
00:41:45:The autopsy found|that it was a cumulative effect...
00:41:48:...from numerous physical traumas|exacerbated by malnutrition...
00:41:52:...which severely inhibited her ability|to recuperate from those traumas.
00:41:57:In other words, her starving body|had little or no means to recover...
00:42:01:...from the injuries it was sustaining,|and so it eventually just gave out.
00:42:06:How did Emily get these injuries?
00:42:07:Some were the result|of violent epileptic seizures...
00:42:10:...and some were self-inflicted.
00:42:12:And why, in your opinion,|did Emily injure herself...
00:42:15:...and why did she stop eating?
00:42:17:Upon review|of her complete medical file...
00:42:20:...I concluded that Emily's epilepsy|had evolved...
00:42:23:...into a condition known as|psychotic epileptic disorder.
00:42:26:This is a rare development,|to be sure...
00:42:28:...but one that I have witnessed|numerous times.
00:42:31:- Emily was epileptic and psychotic?|- Yes.
00:42:35:Explain how this psychotic epileptic|disorder would manifest itself.
00:42:39:The seizures would have|the symptoms of schizophrenia...
00:42:42:<i>... such as auditory|and visual hallucinations... </i>
00:42:46:<i>... and sometimes extreme paranoia. </i>
00:42:48:<i>The seizures may lock up the joints|and slightly contort the body. </i>
00:42:51:<i>The pupils will dilate,|making the eyes appear black. </i>
00:42:55:So you believe|that Emily had epilepsy...
00:42:57:...which developed into|a form of violent psychosis...
00:43:00:...a condition that can be controlled|with Gambutrol?
00:43:02:Yes. And it would've been,|if she'd continued her treatment.
00:43:06:In your opinion, if Emily|had continued with her medication...
00:43:09:...would she be alive today?|- Absolutely.
00:43:11:If treated early, psychotic epileptic|disorder is rarely fatal.
00:43:17:I mean, this...
00:43:19:This was a very sick girl.
00:43:22:The defendant should've realized|that Emily was in need...
00:43:25:...of continued medical treatment.
00:43:29:Thank you, doctor. Your witness.
00:43:35:Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol|could've controlled Emily's condition.
00:43:39:How do you know that?
00:43:41:It's the inevitable result|of taking the drug.
00:43:44:It would've controlled|her seizures...
00:43:47:...which were the root cause|of her psychosis.
00:43:49:But wasn't Emily still experiencing|psychotic symptoms...
00:43:52:...even after she started|taking the medication?
00:43:54:Yes. Because Gambutrol|has a cumulative effect.
00:43:57:It takes time to build up|in the system.
00:44:00:You assume that Gambutrol would've|helped her, but you don't know.
00:44:03:It's a reasonable assumption, but...
00:44:06:No, of course, I can't be certain.
00:44:09:Doctor, is "psychotic epileptic|disorder" a common medical term...
00:44:15:...or did you just make it up?
00:44:17:Well, I distinguished|and named the...
00:44:20:So psychotic epileptic disorder|is really your own pet theory?
00:44:23:- Objection. Argumentative.|- Sustained.
00:44:25:When Emily chose|to stop her medical treatment...
00:44:29:...what do you think|should've been done?
00:44:31:Upon recognizing her condition...
00:44:33:...I would have tranquilized her|and force-fed her.
00:44:37:And then, if necessary...
00:44:38:...I would've treated her|with electroconvulsive therapy.
00:44:41:Electroshock treatment. You would've|done this against her will?
00:44:46:To save her life?
00:44:50:Absolutely.
00:45:01:Nothing further.
00:45:05:The witness may step down.
00:45:09:Your Honor, I offer into evidence this|photograph as People's Exhibit 3-A.
00:45:13:And having done so,|the people rest.
00:45:15:The photograph is entered|into evidence.
00:45:17:We are recessed until|tomorrow morning, 9:30 sharp...
00:45:22:...at which time the defense|will give its opening statement...
00:45:25:...and call its first witness.
00:45:28:I'm sorry I was late.
00:45:30:I didn't get a lot of sleep. Big power|outage knocked out my alarm clock.
00:45:34:- It won't happen again.|- No, I didn't sleep either.
00:45:37:What kept you awake?
00:45:39:Doesn't matter.
00:45:43:You're under attack.
00:45:46:What are you talking about?
00:45:49:You're in a spiritual battle, Erin.
00:45:51:The forces of darkness are trying|to keep you away from the light.
00:45:56:Don't let them.
00:45:59:Don't worry about today.|We're doing fine.
00:46:03:We're getting creamed.|I can't believe I walked right into that.
00:46:06:Look, if we don't find a doctor|to testify that Emily...
00:46:10:...wasn't epileptic or schizophrenic|or schizo-epileptic, we're gonna lose.
00:46:23:Care of the city's main branch|and the university library...
00:46:26:...I bring you another dozen|fun-filled books...
00:46:29:...about the demonic|and the mentally deranged.
00:46:33:They burned women at the stake...
00:46:35:...during witch hunts|for being possessed.
00:46:37:Glad you don't have to defend|those guys.
00:46:39:- How are we on our medical experts?|- Not good.
00:46:42:The psychiatrist you wanted|is tied up in another trial.
00:46:46:And the neurologist is sailing|to Costa Rica.
00:46:50:This book I'm reading,|it's by an anthropologist.
00:46:53:It's about contemporary cases of|possession, mostly in the Third World.
00:46:56:People there are still|primitive and superstitious.
00:46:59:Maybe.
00:47:00:Maybe they see possession|for what it really is.
00:47:03:Maybe we've taught ourselves|not to see it.
00:47:07:- You saying you believe in this stuff?|- No.
00:47:09:Maybe we shouldn't just try|to invalidate the prosecution's case...
00:47:13:...by punching holes|in the medical approach.
00:47:16:Maybe we should also try|to validate the alternative.
00:47:24:- Validate possession in a court of law?|- Yes.
00:47:30:Okay. I guess we could bring in|some priests to talk about exorcisms...
00:47:34:No, the archdiocese|won't let us do that.
00:47:36:They wanna limit the Church's|exposure to Father Moore.
00:47:40:I've got three articles by the|anthropologist who wrote this book.
00:47:43:She approaches|the subject of possession...
00:47:45:...from a scientific perspective|and doesn't try to debunk it.
00:47:49:- You want me to track her down?|- Yeah.
00:47:53:Keep looking for a medical expert|to refute Dr. Briggs.
00:47:56:But send the case file|to this Dr. Sadira Adani.
00:48:01:Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
00:48:03:...as you know by now,|my name is Erin Bruner...
00:48:06:...and I represent the defendant,|Richard Moore.
00:48:10:Mr. Thomas has contended|that Emily Rose suffered...
00:48:13:...from a serious medical condition...
00:48:15:...that required medical treatment,|nothing more.
00:48:18:He has asserted that any attempt|by my client...
00:48:21:...to help Emily by anything|other than medical means...
00:48:24:...was not only inappropriate,|but criminally negligent.
00:48:30:I'm now gonna ask|that you keep an open mind...
00:48:33:...to what our evidence|and testimony will show.
00:48:36:Medical treatment was not|the answer for Emily...
00:48:39:...because she simply did not suffer|from a medical condition.
00:48:43:She was neither epileptic|nor psychotic.
00:48:51:Emily Rose's condition, in fact,|was demonic possession.
00:48:54:An exorcism was her only hope|for a cure.
00:48:58:Some of you may find yourself unable|to reconcile Emily's beliefs...
00:49:02:...or those of the defendant|with your own.
00:49:05:You may not believe demons exist.|You won't have to.
00:49:09:Because you will see that after the|utter failure of doctors to help Emily...
00:49:14:...Father Moore simply tried|to help Emily in a different way...
00:49:17:...using an approach that he,|Emily and her family firmly believed...
00:49:23:...was her only chance for relief.
00:49:25:And we will show that|despite his greatest efforts...
00:49:28:...and his sincere love for Emily...
00:49:32:<i>... there was nothing he could've done|to prevent the death of Emily Rose. </i>
00:49:40:Are you okay?
00:49:43:Aren't you gonna eat anything?
00:50:18:<i>She said it was terrible to hear|the clinking of spoons and forks. </i>
00:50:23:She was always hungry,|but she said they wouldn't let her eat.
00:50:27:Who did she mean by "they"?
00:50:30:The forces that were|in control of her.
00:50:33:That were inside her.
00:50:37:You know, the demons.
00:50:41:Tell us what else happened|that night.
00:50:47:I walked her back to her dorm...
00:50:50:...and she seemed really nervous|and scared.
00:50:53:<i>So I held her for a while,|trying to calm her down. </i>
00:50:57:<i>I fell asleep, but when I woke up,|she wasn't beside me. </i>
00:51:16:Emily?
00:51:29:Hey.
00:51:35:Can you hear me?
00:51:49:<i>I called her father, and he told me|to bring Emily home. </i>
00:51:54:<i>Jason and I put Emily to bed... </i>
00:51:57:<i>... hoping she would sleep. </i>
00:51:59:And when did Father Moore|become involved?
00:52:03:Emily stayed home after that.
00:52:05:She didn't return to school,|and she kept getting worse.
00:52:09:Eventually, when she didn't get better,|we called our priest, Father Moore.
00:52:15:When he arrived,|I sent my daughter Alice upstairs...
00:52:18:<i>... to see if Emily was awake. </i>
00:52:29:Emily?
00:52:34:Can I come in?
00:52:50:- Our Father, who art in heaven...|- Emily?
00:52:58:Father Moore is here.|Can you come downstairs?
00:53:00:- as it is in heaven.
00:53:03:Give us this day our daily bread...
00:53:55:Emily, can you hear me?
00:54:12:Let's get her off the floor.
00:54:15:Alice, no!
00:54:29:I am the one who dwells within.
00:54:35:And I am the one who comes|in His name.
00:54:40:Think you can force me out, priest?
00:54:46:Try.
00:54:49:I dare you.
00:55:52:You've suffered a terrible loss,|Mr. Rose. I know this is difficult.
00:55:55:So thank you for being here today.
00:55:58:Sir, do you often read the Bible?
00:56:00:- Yes, I do.|- So do I.
00:56:03:<i>What about the DSM?</i>
00:56:04:<i>The Diagnostic and Statistical|Manual of Mental Disorders...</i>
00:56:08:...commonly referred to|as the bible of abnormal psychiatry.
00:56:11:- Have you read that?|- No.
00:56:13:<i>So you're not aware|that according to the DSM...</i>
00:56:15:...a person's refusal to eat is|a common indication of anorexia?
00:56:19:<i>Objection. The witness just said|he hasn't read the DSM, Your Honor.</i>
00:56:23:- Sustained.|- Mr. Rose...
00:56:26:...are you aware|that catatonic rigidity...
00:56:28:...specifically a locking up|of the body's joints...
00:56:31:...is a known symptom of psychosis?
00:56:33:No. I haven't studied these things.
00:56:35:Have you ever visited|an insane asylum...
00:56:38:...or a hospital for the mentally ill?
00:56:40:Once. My aunt was in one|before she died.
00:56:44:Really? So there's a history|of mental illness in your family?
00:56:47:I suppose.
00:56:49:Sir, if you saw someone|eating insects...
00:56:52:...on a street corner, would you say|that that person is mentally ill?
00:56:57:- Probably, yes.|- So can you say with confidence...
00:56:59:...that the behavior you saw|in your daughter's bedroom...
00:57:02:...could not be the behavior of|someone suffering from psychosis?
00:57:05:I don't know. She never had|any problems like that before.
00:57:10:It just didn't feel that way to me|or to Father Moore.
00:57:15:- And you trusted him, right?|- Yes.
00:57:17:He is our parish priest.
00:57:19:Fair enough. And after that night,|would you say that you...
00:57:22:...put your daughter entirely|in Father Moore's care?
00:57:25:Yes. We had done all we could.
00:57:28:We said she was in his hands now...
00:57:30:...body and soul.
00:57:33:Thank you. No further questions,|Your Honor.
00:57:37:Thank you, Mr. Rose.|You may step down.
00:57:41:The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.
00:57:44:I am currently a professor|of anthropology and psychiatry...
00:57:48:...at Northwestern University.
00:57:51:Where did you receive|your education?
00:57:52:At Yale, and then at Cambridge.
00:57:55:And what is your specific area|of expertise?
00:57:57:I study the spiritual experiences|of people in various cultures...
00:58:02:...and the physiological|and psychological changes...
00:58:05:...they undergo|during these experiences.
00:58:09:Would it be accurate to say that you|specialize in the study of possession?
00:58:13:Yes. "Possession" is one term|for a basic human experience...
00:58:18:...reported by a great number|of people all around the world.
00:58:23:In my fieldwork, I've seen|many people who experienced...
00:58:28:...a sense of being invaded by|an entity from the supernatural realm.
00:58:33:Why do you think|Emily was invaded?
00:58:35:Why did this possession|happen to her?
00:58:37:Based on my study of the case file...
00:58:40:...I believe that Emily Rose|was a hypersensitive.
00:58:44:A person with|an unusual connection...
00:58:47:...to what Carlos Castaneda called|"the separate reality."
00:58:51:Hypersensitives are born|different from everyone else.
00:58:56:They can have visions of the future,|or see the dead...
00:59:00:...and sometimes be|uniquely susceptible...
00:59:03:...to invasion by an entity|that is alien to them.
00:59:07:Objection.
00:59:10:On what grounds?
00:59:11:How about silliness, Your Honor?
00:59:13:A young girl|suffered terribly and died.
00:59:15:Do we have to subject her illness|to this pseudoscientific analysis?
00:59:19:Both counselors,|please approach the bench.
00:59:22:Your Honor, this testimony|is beyond ridiculous. Visions...
00:59:25:Supernatural belief systems|are shared by millions of people.
00:59:28:<i>We're in The Twilight Zone here.</i>
00:59:30:Her expertise is relevant|to the issues in this case.
00:59:33:Let's have a witch doctor|sift through bones...
00:59:35:Stop.
00:59:40:We've heard a great deal|of testimony...
00:59:42:...in support of a medical explanation|for Emily's condition.
00:59:46:Now we have a witness|who has spent her career...
00:59:48:...studying the defense's|alternative explanation.
00:59:52:An exorcism expert, if you will.
00:59:55:I think we'll hear|what she has to say.
00:59:58:Thank you, Your Honor.
01:00:01:Dr. Adani, why do you think|Emily's exorcism failed?
01:00:06:The medical treatment.|Specifically, the drug Gambutrol.
01:00:11:Please explain.
01:00:13:The exorcism ritual results|in a specific brain activity...
01:00:18:...that cuts the person off from|the possession experience.
01:00:22:But Emily's exorcism|could not have achieved this...
01:00:27:...because the doctor|gave her Gambutrol...
01:00:29:...which has an intoxicating effect|on the brain.
01:00:34:The drug made her immune|to the psycho-spiritual shock...
01:00:38:...that exorcism|is intended to provide.
01:00:41:What do you believe was the result of|treatment with this intoxicating drug?
01:00:45:Gambutrol locked Emily|in the possessed state.
01:00:49:This left her unable to respond|to the exorcism...
01:00:52:...and therefore, it directly|contributed to her death.
01:00:58:Thank you, doctor.
01:01:01:No further questions.
01:01:09:I'm looking at a list of|your published articles, doctor.
01:01:12:You've been quite busy and prolific.
01:01:15:So based on your time spent|with Holy Roller snake-handlers...
01:01:18:...voodoo priestesses|and Indians tripping on peyote buds...
01:01:23:...based on observing|these bizarre individuals...
01:01:27:...you've concluded|that possession is...
01:01:29:...a basic, typical|human experience?
01:01:31:I must say, counselor...
01:01:32:...that's quite a laundry list|of disdain...
01:01:35:...and one that thoroughly|mischaracterizes my research.
01:01:39:No, I don't think possession|is a typical experience.
01:01:44:But I am convinced that it is|a scientifically verified...
01:01:49:...culturally universal one.
01:01:51:Have you ever used Gambutrol|in your studies...
01:01:53:...to test your theory about its effect|on the possession experience?
01:01:57:Absolutely not. That would be|dangerous to the patient.
01:02:01:So this notion of Gambutrol locking|someone in a possessed state...
01:02:04:...the key to your assertion that|her medical treatment harmed Emily...
01:02:08:...this would be your own|pet theory, correct?
01:02:10:- You're just making this one up?|- Objection. Argumentative.
01:02:13:Sustained.
01:02:15:Although I think he's just taking|a page from your book, counselor.
01:02:20:No further questions.
01:02:31:Erin!
01:02:33:I've got a doctor|who wants to testify.
01:02:35:He's an eyewitness, Erin.
01:02:37:He was there.|He was at the exorcism.
01:02:39:- What?|- He called us.
01:02:41:Dr. Graham Cartwright,|Department of Abnormal Psychiatry...
01:02:44:...at St. Mary's Hospital.
01:02:53:Dr. Cartwright. Ring a bell?
01:02:57:Yes.
01:02:59:He was there?
01:03:01:- Yes.|- Father...
01:03:05:...if you want me to defend you,|you've got to give me...
01:03:07:...all the information I need.
01:03:09:With all of this medical testimony|helping the prosecution...
01:03:12:...how could you not tell me|that a doctor attended the exorcism?
01:03:18:He asked that I keep|his involvement confidential...
01:03:22:...and I said I would.
01:03:39:Dr. Cartwright?
01:03:43:I recognize you from those|courtroom drawings on the news.
01:03:48:You're much prettier in real life.
01:03:52:- May I sit?|- Yes, please.
01:04:02:You're losing.
01:04:05:I had hoped Father Moore|wouldn't need me...
01:04:09:...but I don't wanna see him|put away.
01:04:13:How do you know him?
01:04:15:Well, I was his parishioner|at St. Vincent's Church...
01:04:18:...about 15 years ago.
01:04:20:I hadn't seen or heard of him for years|when he called me last fall.
01:04:25:But he needed help, so...
01:04:29:What kind of help, doctor?
01:04:32:He wanted a medical perspective|from a psychiatrist...
01:04:35:...you know, one that he knew,|trusted...
01:04:39:...to observe Emily's physical|and mental state during this...
01:04:46:During the exorcism.
01:04:49:Yeah.
01:04:57:Doctor.
01:05:00:Doctor.
01:05:03:Can you help our case?
01:05:07:That girl was not schizophrenic...
01:05:11:...and she was not epileptic,|or any combination of the two.
01:05:14:I've seen hundreds of people|with those problems.
01:05:16:They can be terrible afflictions,|of course, but they don't scare me.
01:05:21:But what you saw that night in Emily,|that did scare you.
01:05:24:God, if I'd known,|I never would've been there.
01:05:30:I started praying again|since then, you know.
01:05:36:I examined that girl before I drove|back to the city that night.
01:05:41:She was lucid...
01:05:42:...and she was completely aware|of this separate entity inside her.
01:05:46:When she wasn't in his grip, she was|totally herself, completely normal.
01:05:52:The awareness of her alternate mental|state is counterindicative of psychosis.
01:05:56:Crazy people|don't know they're crazy.
01:05:58:That's right.
01:06:00:You'll testify to all of this, in detail?
01:06:03:Everything you saw?
01:06:05:Send me the case files|and tell me when to be in court.
01:06:08:Thank you, doctor.
01:06:11:We need this.
01:06:14:Before he was arrested,|Father Moore sent this to me.
01:06:17:He asked me to take care of it.
01:06:21:It's your burden now.
01:06:25:One more thing.|When you saw Emily...
01:06:27:...did Father Moore ask you|to give her any medical help?
01:06:31:He was already trying to stop her from|injuring herself and urging her to eat.
01:06:36:And I told him, as a doctor,|I couldn't help her.
01:06:46:Dr. Cartwright's going to testify.
01:06:54:Don't you get it?
01:06:56:He's not just an eyewitness|to the exorcism.
01:06:58:He can also refute the prosecution's|medical case. This is huge for us.
01:07:02:When do I get to testify?
01:07:04:I don't know. Let's take this|one step at a time.
01:07:07:No.
01:07:08:What matters most is Emily's story,|which only I can tell.
01:07:15:I understand.
01:07:20:Have you thought about|what I said before?
01:07:23:About dark forces|and demonic attacks?
01:07:32:Yes, I have.
01:07:40:That day, after Briggs testified...
01:07:46:<i>... I was feeling awful. </i>
01:07:48:<i>And I went out for a walk|just to clear my head... </i>
01:07:52:<i>... and I was thinking about|what you said to me. Thinking:</i>
01:07:57:<i>"What if demons really do exist?"</i>
01:08:00:And wondering what that|would mean if I believed that.
01:08:04:Because God knows,|I have my own demons.
01:08:11:And I saw something|lying on the sidewalk.
01:08:18:<i>It was a gold locket... </i>
01:08:21:<i>... with the initials E. C.B.|engraved on it. </i>
01:08:28:My middle name is Christine.
01:08:30:Erin Christine Bruner.
01:08:34:And of all the people walking by|that day, I found that locket.
01:08:39:What are the chances of that?
01:08:42:I don't know, maybe it was a sign.
01:08:45:Or maybe it was just some|incredible coincidence.
01:08:50:But it made me feel...
01:08:52:...like no matter what mistakes|I've made in the past...
01:08:56:...at that moment, I was exactly|where I was meant to be.
01:09:00:Like I was on the right path.
01:09:05:You sound more like a mystic|than an agnostic.
01:09:11:Are you wearing the locket now?
01:09:15:No.
01:09:17:You should.
01:09:24:The archdiocese|doesn't want you to testify.
01:09:29:They're just afraid|that I'll embarrass them.
01:09:31:Testify to some medieval-sounding|supernatural nonsense.
01:09:35:They're expecting me|to talk you out of it.
01:09:38:I've just decided|I'm not even gonna try.
01:09:42:Why not?
01:09:45:If the archdiocese|wants to avoid embarrassment...
01:09:47:...they need you to walk out of here|a free man.
01:09:51:I believe a jury will find you|sincere and credible...
01:09:53:...and when Dr. Cartwright|corroborates your testimony...
01:09:56:...and refutes the prosecution's|medical arguments...
01:09:59:...we'll get an acquittal.
01:10:01:And everyone will thank me for it.
01:10:45:<i>Emily!</i>
01:11:00:God help me.
01:11:09:Do you swear to tell the truth,|the whole truth, so help you God?
01:11:12:I do.
01:11:13:Father Moore, before you could|perform the exorcism...
01:11:16:...you had to get the sanction|of the Church, correct?
01:11:19:Yes, on October the 27th|of last year...
01:11:21:...I presented my assessment and|recommendation to the archbishop...
01:11:25:...and he authorized the exorcism|that day before I left the office.
01:11:30:Tell us what happened that night.
01:11:32:I drove home.
01:11:34:<i>I sat up till after midnight|studying The Roman Ritual...</i>
01:11:38:...thinking about what lay ahead.
01:11:39:<i>You mean The Roman Ritual|of Exorcism.</i>
01:11:41:A text used by Catholic priests...
01:11:43:...as a guide to performing|the exorcism rite.
01:11:45:Yes, I think I actually fell asleep|with the book in my hand.
01:11:48:What happened next?
01:11:50:<i>I woke up, freezing. </i>
01:11:53:<i>It was exactly 3 a. m.</i>
01:11:56:Three a. m. is the demonic|witching hour.
01:11:59:It's a way for demons|to mock the Holy Trinity.
01:12:02:It's an inversion of 3 p. m.,|the miracle hour...
01:12:06:...which is traditionally accepted|as the hour of Christ's death.
01:12:11:I thought I smelled|something burning.
01:12:15:<i>Only later did I connect it... </i>
01:12:18:<i>... and I remembered that that same|smell of something burning... </i>
01:12:21:<i>... had been perceived by Emily. </i>
01:13:33:Holy Mary, mother of God,|pray for us sinners, now and...
01:13:42:Pray for us sinners,|now and at the hour of our...
01:13:51:At the hour of...
01:14:23:What do you make of this gesture,|this nod in your direction?
01:14:29:I don't know. Some kind|of acknowledgment, I guess.
01:14:35:That the game is on.
01:14:40:You're really God's gunslinger,|aren't you, Father?
01:14:43:Standing tall and facing the devil|with your prayer book at your side.
01:14:47:Objection, Your Honor.|Counsel's harassing my witness.
01:14:49:Sustained. Mr. Thomas, you know|I won't allow that in my courtroom.
01:14:54:Forgive me, Your Honor.
01:14:57:Father, did you understand this|black-robed figure to be the devil?
01:15:02:I believe it was|a demonic manifestation.
01:15:04:Like the demonic force|you believe possessed Emily?
01:15:07:- Yes.|- Why do you think it appeared to you?
01:15:09:I believe the demonic|can appear as an apparition...
01:15:11:...much like a ghost,|in an attempt to excite our fear.
01:15:15:- Did it excite your fear, Father?|- It scared the hell out of me.
01:15:19:So this night, when you began to|prepare Emily's exorcism...
01:15:22:...was it your first encounter|with this demon ghost?
01:15:24:- Yes.|- Have you seen it again?
01:15:30:I've seen it ever since.
01:15:37:No further questions at this time.
01:15:44:Redirect, Your Honor.
01:15:47:Father Moore, after you received|the bishop's authorization...
01:15:50:...when did you proceed|with an exorcism?
01:15:52:October 31st.
01:15:54:On Halloween.|Isn't that a bit dramatic?
01:15:57:Halloween tradition is based on|legends throughout history...
01:16:01:...that indicate a real increase|in spiritual activity on that night...
01:16:04:...and I thought we could use the|occasion to draw them into the open.
01:16:08:- The demons, you mean?|- Yes.
01:16:10:Father Moore...
01:16:13:...can you identify this?
01:16:15:It's my tape recorder.|I used it to record the exorcism.
01:16:20:Inside is the tape I made that night.
01:16:23:Why would you make such a tape?
01:16:25:Ever since the technology|has been available...
01:16:28:...exorcists have used tape recorders|to authenticate the ritual...
01:16:31:...and provide a record for review.
01:16:33:I offer into evidence this|cassette recorder and audiotape...
01:16:36:Objection. The people were not aware|of the existence of this tape...
01:16:40:...until last night.|- Neither were we.
01:16:42:This tape is new evidence that came|into our possession yesterday.
01:16:45:We provided counsel for the people|with a transcript of its contents.
01:16:48:You mean this tape was not|given to you by your client?
01:16:51:No, Your Honor. We received it|from a reluctant witness...
01:16:54:...Dr. Graham Cartwright, who will also|be called to testify to its authenticity.
01:16:57:The people will find his name|on the updated witness list...
01:17:00:...we provided to them this morning.
01:17:06:Very well. I'll allow it into evidence.
01:17:13:Father Moore.
01:17:16:Will you play the tape for us now?
01:17:26:<i>This is the exorcism of Emily Rose. </i>
01:17:29:<i>Those present are myself,|Father Richard Moore... </i>
01:17:34:...Nathaniel, Emily's father...
01:17:38:...Jason, her friend...
01:17:42:...a doctor who is here|to monitor Emily during the ritual...
01:17:47:...and Emily herself...
01:17:49:...who has given her permission|for the ritual to be performed.
01:17:55:All right, now listen.
01:17:59:You may say the rosary or any|private prayer for her deliverance...
01:18:03:...when you're not responding|to my words.
01:18:06:Above all...
01:18:08:...do whatever I ask,|without question.
01:18:13:Don't ask it any questions...
01:18:16:...or pay any attention|to what it says.
01:18:20:"It"?
01:18:22:We won't be dealing|with Emily tonight.
01:18:29:Restrain her.
01:18:38:Lord Jesus Christ,|have mercy on us.
01:19:04:It has begun.
01:19:06:Let us pray.
01:19:14:"Because she hopes|in you, my God."
01:19:16:"Send her help from|the holy place, Lord."
01:19:20:"And give her heavenly protection."
01:19:22:"May the Lord be with you."
01:19:25:"And with your spirit."
01:19:27:Our Father, who art in heaven,|hallowed be thy name.
01:19:35:My God. Are you all right?
01:19:37:Dolls and kisses|and crosses and wishes
01:19:39:...you think that can save|your little girl?
01:19:46:Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,|on earth as it is in heaven.
01:19:49:I'm fine.
01:19:51:Give us this day our daily bread.
01:19:54:And forgive us our trespasses as we|forgive those that trespass against us.
01:20:00:And lead us not into temptation...
01:20:02:But deliver us from evil!
01:20:07:Who are you, demon?|Tell me your name.
01:20:20:I am the one who dwells within...
01:20:24:In the Name of Christ...
01:20:25:...identify yourself!
01:20:27:One, two, three, four, five, six.|One, two, three, four, five, six.
01:20:31:Trick or treat.|I give you treats and tricks.
01:20:34:One, two, three, four, five, six.
01:20:43:Father Moore!
01:20:55:Papa!
01:21:08:Emily!
01:21:23:Emily!
01:21:26:She feels so hot, Father!|She's burning up!
01:21:34:Hold her down there on the straw!|Hold her!
01:21:42:Emily!
01:21:59:Doctor! I need you here now.
01:22:05:Watch her vital signs.
01:22:07:In the beginning was the word.
01:22:10:And the word was with God.
01:22:12:And the word was the word,|and what a wonderful word it was.
01:22:16:Through him all things remain.
01:22:17:Without him, nothing was made|that has been made.
01:22:22:And the 70 disciples|returned again with joy, saying:
01:22:25:"Lord, even the devils are subject|unto us through thy name."
01:22:29:Her heart is racing.|It's almost 180 beats a minute.
01:22:33:I beheld Satan as lightning|fall from heaven.
01:22:37:Behold. I give you power to tread on|serpents and scorpions...
01:22:42:...and over all the power|of the enemy.
01:22:44:And nothing shall,|by any means, hurt you.
01:22:48:Nothing?
01:23:06:Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
01:23:07:Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
01:23:19:Release him, demon. I command you|in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
01:23:35:Tell me your name, wicked one.
01:23:37:One, two, three, four, five, six!
01:23:39:He who commands you is he|who ordered you thrown down...
01:23:42:...from the highest heaven|into the depths of hell.
01:23:44:In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ,|I now command you:
01:23:50:Tell me your name!
01:23:52:One, two, three, four, five, six!
01:23:53:Hear, therefore, and fear,|Satan, enemy of the faith.
01:23:58:Give me your name, demon!
01:24:00:Names!
01:24:03:Names!
01:24:08:One, two, three, four, five, six!
01:24:13:Ancient serpents...
01:24:16:...depart from this servant of God!
01:24:19:Tell me your six names!
01:24:23:We are the ones who dwell within!
01:24:28:I am the one who dwelt within Cain!
01:24:32:I am the one who dwelt within Nero!
01:24:35:I once dwelt within Judas!
01:24:38:And I was with Legion!
01:24:40:I am Belial!
01:24:45:And I am Lucifer...
01:24:47:...the devil in the flesh.
01:25:06:Mr. Rose.
01:25:07:Doctor, help him!
01:25:27:<i>After a few moments,|Mr. Rose revived... </i>
01:25:29:<i>... but the exorcism|had to be abandoned. </i>
01:25:33:Emily was taken to her room|and soon fell into a deep sleep.
01:25:38:The whole thing|was a complete failure.
01:25:41:Describe her behavior from the night|of the failed exorcism...
01:25:45:...until the time of her death.
01:25:47:Violence towards others and herself.
01:25:49:Sometimes she screamed|for hours on end.
01:25:52:She drove her head through windows,|tried to bite...
01:25:56:Tried to bite holes in the walls,|breaking several more of her teeth...
01:25:59:...as you saw in|the postmortem photograph.
01:26:02:- You witnessed this?|- Some of it, yes.
01:26:04:I tried to visit every day...
01:26:07:...and the family told me the rest.
01:26:09:Did you attempt another exorcism?
01:26:11:I wanted to, but Emily refused.
01:26:14:And without the consent|of the possessed...
01:26:16:...the exorcism ritual|can't be performed.
01:26:19:Did you encourage her to eat?
01:26:21:Yes, every time I saw her...
01:26:23:...but the few times she tried,|it seemed like...
01:26:27:Seemed like she couldn't swallow,|or she couldn't keep it down.
01:26:30:What about medical care?
01:26:31:I wanted her to continue. I never said|she should quit seeing her doctors.
01:26:35:That would be wrong.|Medical care is not my field.
01:26:37:But you did suggest she stop|taking the drug Gambutrol.
01:26:44:Yes.
01:26:48:After the exorcism,|she asked for my counsel.
01:26:52:She told me that the drugs|had never helped her.
01:26:54:After all, she was on Gambutrol|during the exorcism...
01:26:57:...when her so-called symptoms|were at their peak.
01:27:01:Ultimately, we both felt that|she was beyond medical care...
01:27:06:...and that she had to see this|through to the end...
01:27:10:...by faith alone.
01:27:17:The dual voices we just heard|on this tape...
01:27:22:...you're certain that they were both|coming from Emily at the same time?
01:27:26:Yes. Yes, I heard them.
01:27:27:Have you tampered|with this tape in any way?
01:27:30:No. No, I have not.
01:27:34:No further questions at this time.
01:27:41:Mr. Thomas.
01:27:46:Father Moore, you consider this tape|to be proof of the supernatural?
01:27:51:I think it's a record|of certain indications...
01:27:55:...that Emily was possessed.
01:27:57:Signs of possession,|you may call them.
01:27:59:By "signs of possession," would you|mean her speaking in languages...
01:28:02:...we might assume|she couldn't possibly know?
01:28:04:And the vocalization of two|distinct voices simultaneously?
01:28:08:Yes. Among other signs that I|observed and described to the court...
01:28:11:...while the tape was playing.|Things I saw.
01:28:13:Things you can't hear|on the tape.
01:28:15:We'll just have to take|your word, won't we?
01:28:17:- Your Honor.|- Mr. Thomas.
01:28:19:I apologize.|Father, as Emily's parish priest...
01:28:22:...are you aware that she underwent|advanced catechism training?
01:28:26:Yes. Yes. Her family is very devout.
01:28:27:And in that training, did she study|Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Latin?
01:28:31:Yes, I think that's right.
01:28:32:Might have even studied Aramaic,|Christ and his disciples' language...
01:28:36:...which, according to the transcripts,|we also heard on the tape, correct?
01:28:39:She spoke Aramaic on the tape.|It wasn't part of her training.
01:28:42:But it was offered as an elective|at her catechism school.
01:28:45:I have the school's curriculum|here if you'd like to see it.
01:28:48:No. I'll accept that she might have|been exposed to that language.
01:28:52:And according to|her high school records...
01:28:54:...German was the foreign language|she studied there, yes?
01:28:57:I don't know. If you say so.
01:28:58:So that covers the strange languages|we heard on the tape, correct?
01:29:03:Did I miss any?
01:29:06:- No.|- Good.
01:29:07:We've already established|you're no medical expert.
01:29:10:You said it's not your field.
01:29:11:But are you aware of the dual sets of|vocal cords every human possesses?
01:29:15:- No.|- Have you heard of...
01:29:17:...the superior vocal cords, which are|higher than the ones we use to speak?
01:29:21:No. So you didn't know that|Tibetan monks, for example...
01:29:24:...as part of their religious training,|teach themselves...
01:29:27:...to activate both sets|of vocal cords at once?
01:29:30:No, I didn't know that.
01:29:32:Well, now that you do know,|would you think it's possible...
01:29:35:...that Emily, in her psychotic state...
01:29:37:...might have activated both sets|of vocal cords...
01:29:40:...so as to achieve the amazing effect|we heard captured on your audiotape?
01:29:43:Her state was not psychotic.
01:29:45:Father Moore, you told us|that in the exorcism we heard...
01:29:48:...you actually saw, once again,|this black-robed figure...
01:29:51:...or demonic apparition, am I right?|- Yes.
01:29:54:But we couldn't see him|when you played the tape, correct?
01:29:57:- No, of course not.|- Of course not.
01:29:58:So that would be another|supernatural aspect of the exorcism...
01:30:01:...your tape doesn't prove, correct?|- Yes.
01:30:06:Where is your dark figure, Father?
01:30:08:Is he here now?|Do I look like your demon ghost?
01:30:10:- Your Honor.|- Counselor.
01:30:16:I have nothing further.
01:30:19:Does the defense wish to redirect?
01:30:21:No, Your Honor, but we reserve|the right to recall the witness later.
01:30:25:Very well.|The witness may step down.
01:30:35:Your Honor, my next witness|must have been detained.
01:30:38:If we could take a short recess|so I could...
01:30:40:You've made this court wait before,|counselor. I'm inclined to...
01:30:43:Your Honor, please.
01:30:45:Dr. Cartwright came to us|in good conscience...
01:30:48:...as an eyewitness to the exorcism|on Father Moore's tape.
01:30:51:He can substantiate|all of my client's testimony...
01:30:55:Your Honor, the defense has already|presented its exorcism testimony...
01:30:58:...in dramatic fashion.|Do we really have to..?
01:31:07:We have absorbed some|extraordinary testimony today.
01:31:11:I think we'll take some time|to consider it.
01:31:14:Court is adjourned|until 9:30 tomorrow morning.
01:31:19:- You can't find him?|- I went to meet him, he didn't show.
01:31:22:I called his office, I called his house.
01:31:24:Okay. Go to the hospital, ask around.|Somebody's gotta know where he is.
01:31:42:What the hell happened?
01:31:45:Tell Father Moore I'm sorry.
01:31:47:Tell him I know the demons are real|and I admire his courage...
01:31:51:...for standing and speaking|against them.
01:31:54:Tell him I know what they can do.
01:32:19:- Cartwright's dead.|- I heard.
01:32:23:Are you drunk?
01:32:26:- Not yet, but I'm working on it.|- Have you seen this?
01:32:35:- What the hell were you thinking?|- Karl...
01:32:37:You told me you'd talk him out|of testifying.
01:32:40:Instead, you put on a freak show|with taped demons...
01:32:42:...and a dead girl|speaking in tongues...
01:32:44:...and your client testifies that the|archbishop sanctioned the exorcism.
01:32:49:We'll be lucky if|the archdiocese isn't named...
01:32:52:I had a doctor|who was gonna corroborate.
01:32:54:Besides that, Father Moore's|testimony's crucial to his defense.
01:32:57:Did you forget the archdiocese|is paying for this defense?
01:33:00:The archdiocese isn't on trial.
01:33:04:I swore an oath to do|what's best for my client.
01:33:06:Spare me the law school pieties,|Bruner.
01:33:09:You cashed in your conscience|at the door.
01:33:11:- People can change.|- Like James Van Hopper?
01:33:17:It's not over.
01:33:20:I can put Mr. Rose on the stand...
01:33:22:...to corroborate Father Moore|about the exorcism.
01:33:24:And there are the girls.|Her sister Alice, she saw part of it.
01:33:27:They all look like superstitious rubes.|They've got no credibility.
01:33:30:Thomas will rip them to pieces.
01:33:32:You'll be worse off than you are now,|if that's possible.
01:33:35:You're gonna replace me|on this case.
01:33:38:You've screwed it up|beyond all repair.
01:33:41:But the archdiocese feels|that replacing you now...
01:33:43:...would only draw more|unnecessary attention to the trial.
01:33:46:But just so we're clear, Bruner...
01:33:49:...if you put that priest|on the stand again, I will fire you.
01:34:20:You've been crying.
01:34:25:- Dr. Cartwright is dead.|- What?
01:34:29:He was killed.|There was an accident. I'm sorry.
01:34:36:I know he was your friend.
01:34:42:We've lost.
01:34:46:Without his testimony, it's over.
01:34:50:No.
01:34:51:No, no, no, it isn't over. We're telling|Emily's story. That's what matters.
01:34:56:- It can't be worth all this.|- Yes, it is worth it.
01:34:58:Just let me go back on the stand|and tell the rest of the story.
01:35:01:- I can't do that.|- You must!
01:35:04:You must.
01:35:11:Erin, you once said that you felt|you were on the right path.
01:35:17:Don't stray from that path.
01:35:22:Here, take this.
01:35:24:- What is this?|- Just read it.
01:35:26:And then decide|what you want to do.
01:35:31:<i>I saw your eyes today in court when|I explained the significance of 3 a. m.</i>
01:35:37:<i>It's not going to stop|until Emily's story is told. </i>
01:36:24:Are you gonna make a statement?
01:36:28:Do you believe it was the devil?
01:36:42:Is the defense ready to proceed?
01:36:45:Yes, Your Honor. The defense|recalls Father Richard Moore.
01:36:56:The witness is reminded|that he is still under oath.
01:37:09:- When did you last see Emily alive?|- The night before she died.
01:37:12:Her mother, Maria, called me|and said that Emily had asked for me.
01:37:16:- Why did she ask to see you?|- To give me this.
01:37:19:Did Emily explain to you|the letter's significance?
01:37:22:Yes. She said she'd written it the|morning after the failed exorcism...
01:37:27:...and that it was important|for me to share.
01:37:33:Father Moore,|was Emily a good person?
01:37:38:I believe that one day|Emily will be recognized as a saint.
01:37:44:- So she loved God.|- Yes. She was very devout.
01:37:48:Father Moore, if Emily loved God...
01:37:50:...if she was so good and so devout,|why do you think God...
01:37:53:...allowed this to happen?|- Objection.
01:37:55:What is the relevance|of that question?
01:37:57:Father Moore's belief|in this matter is crucial...
01:37:59:...in establishing his and Emily's|understanding of her condition.
01:38:02:And that mutual understanding|is paramount in determining...
01:38:06:...whether Father Moore was,|in fact, negligent.
01:38:11:I'm going to allow it.
01:38:12:Your Honor, you're not really gonna|let someone testify...
01:38:15:...about why God would allow|the death of a young girl?
01:38:18:The objection has been overruled.
01:38:21:Again, Father Moore:
01:38:24:Why did God allow Emily to become|possessed by demons and then die?
01:38:30:I can let Emily answer that.
01:38:36:"Last night, on Allhallows' Eve...
01:38:39:...Father Moore tried to cast|six demons from my body.
01:38:45:They refused to go.
01:38:48:After the attempted exorcism..."
01:38:50:<i>I was taken to my room,|and I fell into a deep sleep. </i>
01:38:57:<i>I awoke a few hours later,|hearing a voice calling out my name. </i>
01:40:16:<i>"Again, I heard a voice|calling my name. </i>
01:40:20:It was the Blessed Holy Mother|of God.
01:40:25:And when I looked at her...
01:40:27:...she smiled at me and said:
01:40:31:'Emily, heaven is not blind|to your pain."'
01:40:35:She said the Virgin Mary spoke to her|in the middle of a field?
01:40:39:- Yes.|- And do you believe her?
01:40:41:I believe Emily spoke the truth.
01:40:45:Please continue.
01:40:49:<i>"I asked the Blessed Mother,|'Why do I suffer like this?"'</i>
01:40:54:Why did the demons|not leave me tonight?
01:40:58:<i>"She said, 'I am sorry, Emily. </i>
01:41:02:<i>The demons are going to stay|where they are.'</i>
01:41:06:<i>Then she said,|'You can come with me in peace... </i>
01:41:09:<i>... free of your bodily form... </i>
01:41:12:<i>... or you can choose|to continue this. </i>
01:41:17:<i>You will suffer greatly. </i>
01:41:19:<i>But through you, many will come to|see that the realm of the spirit is real. </i>
01:41:27:<i>The choice is yours."'</i>
01:41:37:I choose to stay.
01:42:09:"In the end,|good will triumph over evil.
01:42:14:Through my experience...
01:42:17:...people will know|that demons are real.
01:42:22:People say that God is dead.
01:42:29:But how can they think that...
01:42:32:...if I show them the devil?"
01:42:39:Did you see these wounds on both|of Emily's hands and both feet?
01:42:44:Yes. Yes, the wounds|lasted for some time.
01:42:49:And did you attach any supernatural|significance to these wounds?
01:42:53:I believe they were stigmata.
01:42:57:By that, you mean|supernatural injuries...
01:43:00:...that correspond to the crucifixion|wounds of Jesus Christ?
01:43:03:Yes.
01:43:06:Stigmata are a sign, a mark|indicating one is touched by God.
01:43:16:After that night, why do you think|Emily refused another exorcism?
01:43:21:I believe she'd accepted her fate.
01:43:27:Is there anything else|you'd like to say about Emily?
01:43:34:No.
01:43:39:The defense rests.
01:43:50:Father Moore attaches|divine significance...
01:43:52:...to the wounds|on Emily's hands and feet.
01:43:56:Why?
01:43:59:Because he sees them as confirmation|of what he wants to believe.
01:44:04:That Emily was a saint,|touched by the hand of God.
01:44:08:I'm afraid the truth|is far less inspiring.
01:44:12:Because the truth is, by the time|these miraculous wounds appeared...
01:44:18:...Emily had already shown|a tendency to injure herself...
01:44:21:...and simply did so again|on one of the barbed-wire fences...
01:44:25:...surrounding the Rose family farm.
01:44:33:Father Moore's beliefs are based on|archaic and irrational superstition.
01:44:40:Emily suffered|because she was sick...
01:44:44:...not because she was a saint.
01:44:48:I'm a man of faith.|And I am also a man of facts.
01:44:52:And in here,|facts are what must matter.
01:44:59:And these are the facts of this case:
01:45:02:Emily Rose had epilepsy,|which caused psychosis.
01:45:07:And, given time,|medicine would have cured her.
01:45:11:But it didn't. Why? Because Father|Richard Moore convinced Emily...
01:45:15:...that she wasn't ill,|that she didn't need medicine.
01:45:20:And in the weeks|leading up to her death...
01:45:23:...when she was clearly in need|of medical treatment...
01:45:28:...he failed to have her hospitalized.
01:45:40:So...
01:45:42:...the defense has given us|an extraordinary...
01:45:46:...creative explanation|for the events that led to this.
01:45:51:Ladies and gentlemen,|don't you believe it.
01:45:58:Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil|that did this to Emily Rose.
01:46:07:It was the defendant.
01:46:30:Counselor.
01:46:37:Ethan Thomas calls himself|a man of faith.
01:46:46:I, on the other hand,|am a woman of doubt.
01:46:53:Angels and demons.
01:46:56:God and the devil.
01:47:02:These things either exist,|or they do not exist.
01:47:08:Are we all alone in this life?
01:47:10:Or are we not alone?
01:47:13:Either thought is astonishing.
01:47:19:Do I really believe that this tragedy|is the work of the devil?
01:47:23:To be honest, I don't know.
01:47:26:But I cannot deny that it's possible.
01:47:30:The prosecution|wants you to believe...
01:47:32:...that Emily's psychotic|epileptic disorder was a fact...
01:47:35:...because facts leave no room|for reasonable doubt.
01:47:40:But this trial isn't about facts.
01:47:43:This trial is about possibilities.
01:47:46:Is it a fact that Emily|was a hypersensitive...
01:47:49:...as Dr. Adani suggests?
01:47:51:A person who's more likely, by her|very nature, to become possessed?
01:47:58:I can't say that, but the question is:
01:48:02:Is it possible?
01:48:06:Is it a fact that Gambutrol|anesthetized Emily's brain...
01:48:10:...so that the exorcism ritual|was rendered ineffective?
01:48:15:I can't be sure of that.
01:48:20:But is it possible?
01:48:23:Is it a fact that Emily|was beloved by God?
01:48:29:And that after her exorcism,|she chose to suffer till the end...
01:48:33:...so that we might believe|in a more magical world?
01:48:36:A world where the spiritual realm|really exists?
01:48:40:I can't say that's a fact.
01:48:43:But ask yourself:
01:48:47:Is it possible?
01:48:50:It's what Emily believed.
01:48:52:It's what Father Moore believed.
01:48:54:And that sincere belief is what|determined her choices and his.
01:48:59:Now, for the most|important question:
01:49:04:Is Father Richard Moore guilty...
01:49:07:...beyond a reasonable doubt,|of negligent homicide?
01:49:12:Did he, in fact, neglect|Emily's needs in such a way...
01:49:17:...that her death|is now on his hands?
01:49:19:No! That is not a fact.
01:49:23:It is not a fact|that Emily was epileptic.
01:49:26:It is not a fact|that she was psychotic.
01:49:31:Facts...
01:49:33:...leave no room for possibilities.
01:49:38:The only fact...
01:49:39:...the only thing I know|beyond a doubt in this case...
01:49:45:...is that Father Moore|loved Emily with his whole heart.
01:49:49:He did everything in his power|to help her.
01:49:52:He has risked his very freedom|so we could hear her story.
01:50:04:Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
01:50:06:...in my job I sometimes|have to defend bad men.
01:50:10:Father Richard Moore|is not one of them.
01:50:16:Don't send a good man to prison.
01:50:19:I'm not asking that you believe|everything that Father Moore believes.
01:50:22:I'm simply asking that you believe|in Father Moore.
01:50:42:Madam Foreman,|has the jury reached a verdict?
01:50:45:We have, Your Honor.
01:50:58:Please read the verdict out loud.
01:51:05:<i>"In the case of The People|v. Father Richard Moore...</i>
01:51:08:...we, the jury, find the defendant...
01:51:11:...guilty of negligent homicide."
01:51:16:The court thanks the jury|for its service.
01:51:20:Sentencing for this case|will be set for April 3rd.
01:51:24:Your Honor, if it pleases the court...
01:51:26:...Father Moore requested|at the start of trial...
01:51:29:...that if found guilty,|he would be sentenced immediately.
01:51:32:Yes, I recall that.
01:51:34:Does the prosecution have any|objection to expedited sentencing?
01:51:39:Very well.
01:51:44:Father Richard Moore,|do you understand this sentence...
01:51:47:...which has been found against you?|- Yes, Your Honor.
01:51:50:And do you understand|the gravity of this crime?
01:51:53:That you may, under the law, be|sentenced to a term of up to 10 years?
01:51:57:Yes, I do.
01:51:59:Are there any statements|you wish to make...
01:52:01:...before I impose this sentence?
01:52:03:- No, Your Honor.|- Very well.
01:52:05:Excuse me, Your Honor...
01:52:07:...but the jury would like to make|a recommendation...
01:52:10:...regarding the sentence.|- Objection.
01:52:12:Sit down, counselor.
01:52:14:It's only a recommendation,|and I would like to hear it.
01:52:20:We recommend a sentence|of time served.
01:52:32:I'll accept that.
01:52:39:You are guilty, Father Moore.
01:52:42:And you are free to go.
01:52:45:- This court is dismissed.|- All rise.
01:52:56:Thank you.
01:53:24:Well, you shocked us all.
01:53:28:Everyone at the firm sees this|as another victory.
01:53:30:The archdiocese is pleased.
01:53:32:They feel the trial has raised|public interest in the Church.
01:53:35:Have you seen the news?
01:53:37:There's our priest,|leaving the courthouse a free man...
01:53:40:...right next to you.
01:53:42:Just like James Van Hopper.
01:53:46:All right, I'll say it. I was wrong.
01:53:48:But I'm ready to make it right.
01:53:50:I'm offering you|a full partnership in the firm.
01:53:57:Keep it.
01:54:23:Will you be able to return|to your parish?
01:54:29:I can't go back.
01:54:31:Not now.
01:54:35:Once you've looked|into the darkness...
01:54:38:...I think you carry it with you|for the rest of your life.
01:54:46:What about you?
01:54:50:I believe you've seen|the darkness too.
01:54:56:I don't know.
01:55:00:I'm not sure what I've seen.
01:55:11:- Who chose the epitaph?|- I did.
01:55:16:It's from the second chapter|of Philippians, verse 12.
01:55:20:Emily recited it to me|the night before she died.
