{3915}{3992}Please,|I must see Miss Lipscomb.
{3994}{4027}At this hour?
{4028}{4081}It's urgent... about my sister.
{4147}{4203}You'll wake the whole house!
{4371}{4415}Miss Lipscomb!
{4445}{4485}It's Mister Claudel.
{4657}{4709}She's vanished.|Where could she be?
{4711}{4745}She told me nothing.
{4747}{4794}My mother's very upset.
{4795}{4827}Try the studio.
{5082}{5170}PARIS, FEBRUARY 1885
{11506}{11576}Camille, you went digging|for clay again?
{11578}{11627}I just saw your mother.
{11629}{11678}She was frantic.
{11680}{11715}And Paul...
{11717}{11802}...was ready to look for you|all over the world.
{11823}{11866}Are you listening?
{11905}{11985}Boucher is right,|you've got the madness of mud.
{12011}{12084}You're awful.|You never answer me...
{12111}{12207}...even when it's about you.|Only your work counts.
{12312}{12378}Am I meant to be a sculptor?
{12423}{12471}I'm such a dreamer!
{12589}{12640}Boucher says that|Rodin is a genius...
{12642}{12693}...but that he seduces|all the girls.
{12735}{12770}We'll have to watch out.
{12778}{12827}He's as scandalous as his work?
{12829}{12884}All his models sleep with him.
{13003}{13094}If he faces the light,|we'll see him better.
{13434}{13477}Toto is transparent.
{13516}{13555}Don't leave it there.
{13557}{13625}When I'm nervous,|I need Toto.
{13627}{13670}He'll think we're mad.
{13724}{13762}He's here!
{13957}{13984}Let him in.
{13986}{14016}Why me?
{14043}{14087}Let him in!
{14238}{14270}Hello, young ladies.
{14293}{14333}Yes, yes...
{14335}{14429}Yes... I must tell you,|I can't stay. I'm in a rush.
{14431}{14462}Boucher said...
{14541}{14598}If I may say...
{14599}{14704}Boucher... wins a prize, great!|A year in Rome...
{14706}{14809}...and who wouldn't|rather be in Rome? Right?
{14879}{14936}But as for replacing him...
{14938}{14987}...that's a big step!
{15007}{15075}No, you have to work the clay.
{15094}{15180}Don't rely on inspiration.|It doesn't exist.
{15263}{15322}What can I teach you, anyway?
{15383}{15444}A sculpture takes time.
{15446}{15498}You have to let it rest...
{15519}{15580}...forget it...|to better judge it.
{15659}{15734}I know. I haven't finished it.|It's unfinished.
{15849}{15974}Also, the timing's bad. I've|taken on much work. I'm swamped.
{15975}{16014}Have some tea, at least.
{16104}{16190}Boucher said you left|the Academy. Is that true?
{16191}{16247}Yes, why?|Shouldn't we have?
{16249}{16343}No, no. You've already|solved the heating problem.
{16344}{16379}This is better.|Heating is very important.
{16400}{16482}My first studio was a stable.|Freezing cold.
{16512}{16591}A rich lady|wanted a statue of herself.
{16593}{16655}I didn't have a cent,|so I got some old shoes...
{16657}{16754}and tried to burn them|for heat, you understand?
{16756}{16853}The lady arrived and posed...|but the smell!
{16882}{16943}She passed out from the smell.
{16945}{17015}The scare of my life!|I thought she was dead.
{17083}{17146}What's this prehistoric beast?
{17148}{17228}That's Toto.|A small African rhinoceros.
{17262}{17295}Didn't you know?
{17297}{17341}Zero plus zero equals Toto.
{17443}{17526}It feels so nice here,|I forgot I'm in a hurry.
{17722}{17776}Monsieur Rodin,|I'd like some marble.
{17778}{17821}You've worked on stone?
{17823}{17862}Granite. In the country.
{17864}{17945}Rhinoceros, granite...|You like challenges, Miss Claudel?
{17968}{17991}So...
{18019}{18073}...we'll all|think it over...
{18075}{18159}We'll see about the lessons.|There are other teachers...
{18183}{18222}Young ladies, good-bye.
{18280}{18405}He's so handsome and strong!|And bright! What do you think?
{18407}{18434}Nothing.
{18436}{18467}What do you mean, nothing?
{18469}{18563}We didn't ask him here|to tell us stories.
{18578}{18639}That was just to get acquainted.
{18641}{18687}I can't afford it anyway.
{18720}{18806}That type says, "I know, you don't.|I see, you don't."
{18807}{18846}You're exaggerating, Camille.
{18878}{18926}He never mentioned our work!
{18957}{18994}Do you realize?
{19055}{19094}What a lout!
{20361}{20417}Does that amuse you?|Not me.
{20419}{20479}You can yawn for Papa on Sunday.
{20547}{20621}Until now|Papa went along with you.
{20654}{20708}But this time he won't.
{20730}{20837}The Academy was too disciplined.|You want your freedom.
{20860}{20939}Sharing a studio|with a dizzy foreigner!
{20945}{21025}You don't care what it costs!|Classes... rent...
{21088}{21172}Papa has to earn that money,|cent by cent...
{21174}{21227}at the expense|of all else.
{21229}{21288}Some life for a man his age!
{21290}{21368}Seeing his family once a week!|And what about me?
{21436}{21528}When he hears that you sneak out|to steal clay...
{21530}{21639}...keeping us up all night,|making your brother fail school!
{21655}{21691}All for your whims!
{21693}{21753}For your so-called "vocation"!
{21811}{21870}And you upset your brother,|having him...
{21891}{21948}read filthy books|unsuitable for his age...
{21951}{21983}Unsuitable for any age!
{22083}{22110}Leave her alone.
{22111}{22163}That shameless brat!
{22191}{22297}My first marble! He'll like it|so much, he'll sign it.
{22299}{22353}Like Michelangelo with his pupils?
{22355}{22414}I wouldn't have Hugo|sign my poems.
{22452}{22549}You're an anarchist, Paul.|A young savage.
{22580}{22616}I can't bear school.
{22719}{22793}Thank you for giving me|Rimbaud's poems.
{22835}{22943}Will I ever be able|to run away like he did?
{22991}{23034}I love your writing...
{23054}{23091}...and I adore you.
{23114}{23172}You alone believe in me.
{23199}{23243}My little Paul.
{23244}{23299}You look at me so sweetly.
{23301}{23349}Is that a sin?
{23351}{23395}Sin doesn't exist.
{23660}{23752}MARBLE WAREHOUSE
{24503}{24526}Limet...
{24552}{24605}...give this young lady|some marble.
{24607}{24663}One of the chunks from "Eve."
{24664}{24750}Excuse me... I'm being visited|by the Ministry of Culture.
{24769}{24811}Send Louis with her.
{24923}{24972}Do you have tools for marble?
{24990}{25015}Good luck, then.
{25077}{25166}The "Gates of Hell" will be|one of the century's most beautiful...
{25167}{25216}But you're far from finished...
{25218}{25270}Are the Cathedrals finished?
{25587}{25638}What have you worked with?
{25640}{25668}Green granite...
{25670}{25696}From Soissons?
{25698}{25724}Yes.
{25895}{25918}Eve!
{25949}{26018}Mr. Rodin is spoiling you.|Pure Pitacci.
{26269}{26299}Smell it!
{26417}{26479}This one|will probably do nicely.
{26754}{26792}That one?
{27017}{27051}No. This one.
{27053}{27135}Paros, from Greece.|Be careful, it's fragile.
{27340}{27381}A hand, or a handout?
{27383}{27412}Neither one.
{27519}{27624}Why accept an official order|for work you don't plan to do?
{27626}{27690}We'll never stay on schedule|this way.
{27692}{27747}My ideas don't|come from orders.
{27770}{27804}What did she choose?
{27806}{27836}The pyramid.
{27838}{27872}The little one?
{27874}{27932}Yes, the Paros marble.
{27934}{28019}She doesn't know|how hard it is to work with.
{28039}{28103}One wrong tap|and it breaks in half.
{28129}{28202}She's too young.|She should take lessons.
{28204}{28249}I saw her work, Limet...
{28273}{28351}Two heads... an old woman|and a tramp. Merely sketches.
{28353}{28452}You know, when the clay is more alive|than the model... like real flesh...
{28454}{28479}That's rare.
{28510}{28546}You're wrong about her.
{28549}{28622}She doesn't need lessons.|Boucher is wrong, too.
{28624}{28659}She'll learn by doing.
{28932}{28984}"With that horrible warning..."
{28986}{29069}"as the steel touched my neck...
{29071}{29201}"my body shivered and|a muffled cry escaped my lips."
{29203}{29262}"The executioner's hand trembled."
{29283}{29342}"'Sir,' he said to me..."
{29343}{29417}"'Have I hurt you?"'
{29436}{29498}"These hangmen have soft hearts."
{29553}{29620}You seem to love Victor Hugo,|Giganti.
{29639}{29687}He's the greatest man alive.
{29733}{29777}He's all I have...
{29897}{29942}Now I have you, too.
{30545}{30610}Rodin could not|have been indifferent.
{30612}{30694}The Dean of|the School of Fine Arts...
{30695}{30768}...thought you were already|Rodin's pupil.
{31211}{31298}What have I done|to deserve such a daughter!
{31328}{31366}Always conniving...
{31368}{31428}...to steal her father's money.
{31482}{31527}Don't you interfere.
{31549}{31627}That tramp!|If my first baby hadn't died...
{31628}{31682}...I'd never have|given birth to her!
{31716}{31767}She behaves like a boy!
{31825}{31891}She hurts me...
{31892}{31936}...sets her father against me.
{31938}{32017}He'll make us all suffer|for her filth.
{32066}{32134}Madame, get dressed, please.
{32159}{32222}It doesn't help|to shut yourself away.
{32243}{32298}She should be shut away!
{32335}{32413}Louise Athanaise! Come on out!|This is ridiculous!
{32739}{32774}Good morning, Monsieur Limet.
{32815}{32844}No luck?
{32846}{32893}Thank Monsieur Rodin for me.
{33667}{33743}Jessie, read this!|Read it out loud!
{33783}{33887}"Young ladies. I am beginning|a major piece of work."
{33889}{33987}"I need apprentices. Tomorrow, 8:00 a.m.|My studio. Rodin."
{34677}{34713}Watch your step!
{34933}{34954}Morhardt!
{34955}{34989}Where's our friend?
{34991}{35050}Bad timing.|Monsieur Rodin isn't here.
{35088}{35134}He's very busy these days.
{35135}{35237}Rodin goes too far.|Did you see those two young girls?
{35459}{35556}On the "Gates of Hell" there'll be|small statues of the damned.
{35624}{35662}Rodin has great ideas.
{35663}{35753}With a little help from Dante|and his "Divine Comedy."
{35755}{35826}He doesn't need help.|He's been commissioned.
{35828}{35908}The boss will accomplish|what he wants. He always does.
{35910}{35939}He's like a father to me.
{35941}{35976}You certainly love him.
{36359}{36449}Marcel, you needn't have|written on the cloth!
{36451}{36474}Miss Claudel did it.
{36476}{36495}Foolishness!
{36496}{36524}Remove that scroll!
{36584}{36630}Put the two Adams back together.
{36863}{36907}Move out of the way!
{37018}{37039}Young lady...
{37127}{37167}Stand between them again.
{37358}{37398}Nice...
{37418}{37449}...very nice...
{37529}{37584}Make me another Adam|for tomorrow.
{37742}{37776}Thank you, all.
{37855}{37902}How was Victor Hugo's|first sitting?
{37932}{38042}I love him. I'd like to sculpt him|nude. Like the God that he is!
{38056}{38100}Hey girls! Got a lover?
{38102}{38133}They're not telling.
{38135}{38164}Stuck-up!
{38166}{38209}She's a proper young lady.
{38211}{38267}She's cultured,|she's saving it...
{38269}{38342}Tell me,|when do we see Rodin work?
{38344}{38393}He's busy thinking.
{38395}{38429}He'd better watch out!
{38431}{38501}Women are less important|than official orders.
{38503}{38553}An artist is an artist.
{38555}{38618}The truth is,|he has no ideas.
{38619}{38689}You know that Rodin is busy|arguing with the Minister.
{38691}{38795}You know that he's the biggest|lecher since Victor Hugo.
{39100}{39155}I'm sure it will be beautiful,|Giganti.
{39157}{39246}You'll be almost crouching,|with your head down...
{39268}{39322}...leaning on your knee.
{39350}{39436}And your arms...|your arms will hang down...
{39438}{39488}...hugging one leg.
{39507}{39568}I'm sure it will be powerful.
{39620}{39643}Powerful...
{39644}{39680}...and tender...
{39707}{39739}...just like you.
{40830}{40862}Taking a break?
{40863}{40894}It has to dry.
{40895}{40921}Want company?
{40943}{40978}All the screens are taken.
{40980}{41028}You wouldn't know what to do.
{41083}{41155}Come on, honey!|Show me what you've got!
{41157}{41185}Let go!
{41187}{41226}You're asking for it!
{41228}{41323}I'll get you. Girls don't|play coy for long, here.
{41325}{41366}You can play without me.
{41538}{41571}Leave her alone.
{41572}{41626}You! You'd better|stick to plastering!
{41667}{41742}Don't you get it?|You're like plaster...
{41743}{41806}...dull and sticky!
{41807}{41843}Where are you going?
{41845}{41887}Back to my real work!
{42094}{42169}Forget it.|You don't stand a chance!
{42187}{42255}What's wrong? Trouble?
{42287}{42354}I just passed by|an angry young girl...
{42355}{42404}Wait for me in the office.
{42503}{42557}Return to your pose, Adele.
{42622}{42691}He doesn't like my marble foot.
{42755}{42815}He'll never sign it.
{42875}{42945}"A miracle is based|on three conditions:"
{42947}{43068}"The credulity of all,|the good will of some..."
{43070}{43142}"And the tacit consent|of the principal creator."
{43144}{43230}He should have understood...
{43231}{43356}You take everything too much|to heart. Did you ask him?
{43388}{43438}He never speaks to me.
{43587}{43696}"He who is a legend in his own time,|is ruled by that legend."
{43723}{43798}"It may begin|in absolute innocence."
{43799}{43856}"But, to cover up flaws and..."
{43858}{43912}"...maintain the myth|of Divine Power..."
{43914}{44001}"...one has to employ|desperate measures."
{44141}{44171}We'll hire another...?
{44173}{44222}No! Still no word|from the Claudel girl?
{44224}{44247}No.
{45219}{45268}You are unbearable!
{45270}{45306}Why did you leave?
{45340}{45379}Such outrageous behavior!
{45381}{45442}Are you always so impulsive?
{45475}{45558}I have no time.|I didn't hire you as a joke.
{45578}{45663}I need people on the job,|day and night.
{45665}{45710}There's work to be done!
{45914}{45956}Where did you find that clay?
{46011}{46046}Under my feet.
{46091}{46132}In Paris, Monsieur.
{47071}{47119}You got the head|and neck right...
{47121}{47167}...but you avoided the body.
{47203}{47285}The human body is a world|that moves. It's life!
{47301}{47389}Never think in surfaces,|think in depths.
{47414}{47503}If you want to copy|the head of my Adam, look...
{47505}{47534}No, I didn't...
{47535}{47572}Where's your model?
{47619}{47660}Not a pro, I hope.
{47662}{47727}They're too soft, flabby...|Come and look...
{47819}{47851}Stand here, see...
{47971}{48022}You must search in the neck...
{48131}{48188}...you must force the muscles.
{48190}{48293}There... You never see me work,|so you think I do nothing.
{48295}{48339}Careful, you'll hurt him!
{48375}{48451}There you are.|You spare your model.
{48453}{48521}You're bold enough|to sculpt a nude man.
{48523}{48615}But you make him comfortable,|and you hide his body.
{48634}{48691}I'll show you|where I work in secret.
{48692}{48751}You grant that I'm bold,|at least.
{48781}{48874}You're intelligent and|you work from the heart.
{48887}{48961}But you go about it|the wrong way.
{48981}{49028}You want me to teach you?
{49030}{49090}I don't need lessons|or advice.
{49091}{49154}I work directly|with live subjects.
{49171}{49222}I accept, Miss Claudel.
{49965}{50006}Am I fired?
{50007}{50039}She's a pupil.
{50040}{50112}Oh, sure, another pupil...|Too bad!
{50114}{50179}Because I froze yesterday.
{50211}{50240}What'll we try?
{50272}{50341}I hope today|you have an idea, at least.
{50343}{50414}The longer you think,|the colder I get.
{51693}{51763}One can only see the profiles|in shadow.
{51787}{51843}That profile is no good. See?
{53310}{53346}Won't you go in?
{53348}{53371}No...
{53430}{53482}I'll go see Jessie first.
{53527}{53603}No... not tonight.|I'll see her tomorrow.
{53605}{53685}You already know things|that took me years...
{53704}{53774}And, what I saw in Italy...
{53775}{53818}Michelangelo's|unfinished slaves...
{53820}{53895}...lost, abandoned|in a dark corner...
{53947}{54030}The randomness of|what's left unfinished...
{54031}{54079}...it's a complete emotion...
{54094}{54145}...before pure genius.
{54147}{54203}The other day when I saw you...
{54205}{54285}...all white,|standing between my two Adams...
{54287}{54366}...you gave me the idea|for a third one.
{54484}{54566}I thought inspiration|doesn't exist.
{54567}{54594}Pardon me?
{54596}{54644}I thought|inspiration doesn't exist.
{54663}{54732}I'm so happy.
{54734}{54798}I'm so happy, Camille.
{54799}{54862}I'll take you wherever you want.
{54911}{54943}Anywhere.
{55118}{55153}To the studio.
{55155}{55193}Your studio?
{55195}{55264}Yes... No.
{55266}{55309}Giganti is probably sleeping.|I'll go home.
{55311}{55353}Shall we go to Italy?
{55355}{55386}I'm going in.
{55468}{55508}Afraid of being scolded?
{55627}{55653}Honest?
{55717}{55785}I'm no longer a child.
{55787}{55836}And my mother|doesn't speak to me.
{55845}{55865}Why?
{55901}{55990}She doesn't like sculpture...|All that filth...
{56018}{56114}Mine always said, "Get rid of them!|They're everywhere!"
{56159}{56189}"Even under the bed!"
{56212}{56241}"Your mess!"
{56287}{56333}You see...
{56335}{56379}I'm twice your age...
{56419}{56487}...but we'll have|the same memories.
{56656}{56688}Good night.
{57226}{57286}I never meant|to copy your Adam.
{57287}{57368}My Giganti hides his body|because he's hurt.
{57621}{57645}Your coat!
{57737}{57802}At least you know|what moves you...
{57803}{57839}I no longer know.
{61646}{61670}Look, Paul...
{61694}{61718}He signed!
{61719}{61762}Victor Hugo is dead.
{61892}{61923}Is that her?
{61925}{61974}She has eyes you read about.
{61994}{62027}Deep blue, Schwob.
{62139}{62181}Victor Hugo is dead!
{62191}{62239}Victor Hugo is dead!
{62250}{62307}Victor Hugo is dead!
{62608}{62711}All of France weeps for Hugo,|and you cry over nonsense!
{62713}{62757}I want to go with you!
{62759}{62795}But it's a funeral!
{62866}{62905}I'm saving you a trip.
{62907}{62987}I want to see the procession.
{62989}{63029}There isn't any.
{63031}{63090}Yes, there is!|I read about it.
{63091}{63121}Now, Rose...
{63152}{63207}The truth is,|you're ashamed of me.
{63209}{63268}You'll be happier|on your balcony.
{63323}{63361}Oh, leave me alone!
{63742}{63789}Have you seen Giganti?
{64299}{64335}What heat!
{64362}{64402}Oh, such heat!
{64443}{64532}Can't you play something else,|dear?
{64681}{64762}She said,|"You're ashamed of me!"
{64763}{64811}And he said...
{64812}{64878}"Rose, you'll be|happier on your balcony."
{64880}{64968}And old Rose was dressed|in pink, from head to toe!
{64970}{65014}Who is this Rose?
{65015}{65075}Louis says it's ancient history.
{65117}{65150}Is she his wife?
{65151}{65230}Louis says she's one of several.|But they're not married.
{65241}{65266}You're sure?
{65267}{65347}Positive.|Her name is Rose Beuret.
{65360}{65402}It's hot, isn't it?
{65404}{65432}You're sure?
{65434}{65450}Yes.
{65452}{65479}Are you sure?
{65481}{65499}Yes.
{66467}{66499}Get dressed.
{66713}{66757}That funeral wore me out.
{66841}{66881}Poor Victor Hugo.
{66938}{67001}Come back tomorrow.|It's too hot today.
{67026}{67057}Good-bye, sir.
{67090}{67174}Another party that|turns into crap.
{67176}{67251}All the simpering|and fake grief.
{67280}{67329}His corpse comes in handy.
{69694}{69766}You're a fine sight|in those dark panes!
{69887}{69969}The country will|do us all good.
{69971}{70065}She thinks she doesn't need|the rest.
{70087}{70179}Walk around! You'll step|on your sisters' skirts!
{70249}{70334}I've invited Monsieur Rodin|to Villeneuve.
{70336}{70392}It's time we thanked him.
{70394}{70462}But, Papa, he's too busy.|He can't come.
{70463}{70518}I wrote to him. We'll see...
{70541}{70641}Tell the priest I still|want to tear down his church.
{70658}{70753}Louis Prosper!|Stop tormenting that poor priest.
{70837}{70903}Have a good trip!|See you Sunday.
{72532}{72599}Monsieur Rodin. I beg you...
{72601}{72659}don't come to Villeneuve.
{73358}{73426}Notice the curves|of the steeple.
{73962}{73993}Delighted, Madame Rodin.
{74022}{74083}We wanted to thank you...
{74085}{74127}We feel honored...
{74129}{74170}How was your trip?
{74172}{74232}Camille! Our guests are here.
{74511}{74572}We used to live here all year...
{74574}{74698}...but my husband works|in Rambouillet now.
{74700}{74766}And then,|Camille dragged us to Paris.
{74798}{74839}Here's Camille...
{75007}{75032}I know...
{75034}{75094}May I present my brother,|Paul...
{75146}{75166}Delighted.
{75371}{75428}Sensual pleasures|are everywhere...
{75430}{75474}The color of the foliage...
{75514}{75558}...the quality of the sky...
{75568}{75627}Stop! Rose will catch on.
{75629}{75660}I don't care.
{75674}{75703}Silence!
{75743}{75824}If only we had|lettuce like this in Paris!
{75826}{75886}You flatter my wife.|It's her garden.
{75888}{75970}I grow tomatoes on my balcony.
{75971}{76012}Rose is full of ideas.
{76014}{76064}I don't want to see them.
{76066}{76159}You should have stopped him.|And he brought her!
{76184}{76232}I'll never forgive you.
{76269}{76310}Do you want to wash up?
{76326}{76350}Exactly.
{76352}{76376}Follow me.
{76511}{76551}Wear out the earth...
{76694}{76733}Aren't you glad to see me?
{76746}{76829}Why did you come?|It's horrid. I'm ashamed.
{77363}{77424}It's a good way to keep time.
{77426}{77476}To be precise, Madame...
{77478}{77561}...this poor priest|keeps us informed...
{77563}{77634}...of all his|pitiful activities.
{77669}{77730}Are you a practicing Catholic?
{77793}{77842}I do as Monsieur Rodin does.
{77868}{77930}And what does Monsieur Rodin do?
{77948}{78050}This may surprise you,|but I almost became a monk.
{78080}{78141}I was young.|My older sister...
{78143}{78207}...Maria, whom I adored...
{78209}{78255}...became a nun...
{78256}{78312}after a promise of marriage|fell through...
{78368}{78409}She died of grief.
{78436}{78527}After her death|I entered the monastery.
{78529}{78582}I began leading her life.
{78612}{78723}To my surprise, my Confessor|asked me to do his portrait.
{78725}{78805}By making me sculpt,|he brought me back to life.
{78807}{78854}To my life, I mean.
{78882}{78935}It's a miracle that...
{78937}{79022}...he recognized the difference|between grief and a vocation.
{79042}{79072}No doubt...
{79118}{79170}I think I'd do the same thing.
{79171}{79191}You?
{79212}{79247}You'd become a nun?
{79248}{79283}I would stop...
{79316}{79352}What arrogance!
{79354}{79394}From whom do you get it?
{79431}{79465}Camille is not arrogant.
{79484}{79554}She just won't settle for less...
{79555}{79616}than she thinks she deserves.
{79618}{79659}When she's violent...
{79661}{79710}it's only because she's impassioned.
{79711}{79744}As a child...
{79760}{79862}...she used to model|human skeletons out of clay.
{79873}{79951}Then she'd bake them in the oven.
{79953}{79997}And she'd forget to eat and sleep.
{79999}{80065}It was amazing.
{80098}{80148}When she's touchy...
{80150}{80233}it's because she's uncompromising.
{80365}{80435}Monsieur Rodin must have|realized this.
{80437}{80479}Isn't that so,|Monsieur Rodin?
{80481}{80538}Ah, temperament!
{80539}{80590}Where do we get our temperament?
{80629}{80680}We don't know what it is...
{80682}{80733}but we do know what it does!
{81116}{81194}On the "Gates of Hell"|I'm three years behind.
{81250}{81329}So, if I don't want to be|hounded by bureaucrats...
{81353}{81429}I must have help.|I can't work alone.
{81431}{81507}And Jessie Lipscomb|is leaving us for England.
{81509}{81594}I need qualified artists.|Talented ones! And fast!
{81596}{81642}No time to lose.
{81644}{81707}Which brings me...
{81708}{81770}to the pressing reason|for my visit here.
{81835}{81888}I want Camille in Paris!
{81912}{81937}Oh, yes.
{82027}{82062}That's the end of vacation.
{82251}{82316}Madame Rodin, coffee is served.
{83762}{83831}I feel you're abandoning me.
{83832}{83866}You're abandoning me.
{83868}{83930}Rodin didn't|come to say good-bye.
{83932}{83991}Give his secrets to the English.
{83993}{84062}I won't give them.|I'll sell them!
{87385}{87419}Here they come!
{87614}{87637}Welcome.
{87835}{87872}Marvellous, isn't it?
{87914}{87954}Pure 18th century...
{88052}{88080}Change the locks.
{88102}{88136}It sure stinks...
{88138}{88188}Industry, Louis, industry.
{88190}{88259}I thought the "Neubourg Folly"|was a madhouse.
{88553}{88588}Did you check thoroughly?
{88590}{88633}Yes. Nobody's living here.
{88712}{88773}The country!|Right here in Paris!
{89064}{89131}Do you like our new studio,|Miss Claudel?
{89174}{89226}I'm the happiest woman alive.
{89248}{89278}I love you.
{89287}{89336}I love you!
{89908}{89978}Look how beautiful you are...|Look...
{90540}{90585}Stay with me tonight...
{90602}{90621}No...
{90652}{90712}I don't want to upset my family.
{91462}{91502}Just look at them!
{91554}{91587}Scandalous!
{93048}{93132}Louis Prosper, come inside now.
{93134}{93174}You'll catch cold.
{93569}{93619}When I think Camille|doesn't even bother...
{93621}{93683}to come home on Sunday.
{93706}{93751}Your one day at home...
{93787}{93831}Are you listening to me?
{93890}{93950}She's a bad example for Paul.
{94568}{94611}I couldn't find Giganti!
{94642}{94691}You'll forget him.
{94693}{94756}He'd have been a good|"Bourgeois of Calais." To work!
{95806}{95842}You loved her?
{95868}{95918}I know you loved her.
{95920}{95974}You never dared tell her.
{96036}{96155}I'll tell you a secret, Giganti.|Without her, I don't know...
{96184}{96254}She's my only|source of inspiration.
{96300}{96367}What does she have|that I've lost?
{98283}{98308}I'm going.
{98310}{98366}No. What'll I do without you?
{98382}{98435}Poor boy,|drowning in filthy water...
{98437}{98531}...too disgusted to call|for help, he lets himself die.
{98532}{98597}I want to go far away,|leave Paris...
{98628}{98662}...leave the family...
{98682}{98727}leave everything around me...
{98728}{98763}before it's too late.
{98764}{98839}Rodin will surely help you.
{98840}{98879}You'll join|the foreign service...
{98895}{98939}At least now|you remember I exist.
{98940}{98971}What's this?
{98990}{99044}Your sister and her fiancé|are here!
{99068}{99131}Tell Rodin|you'd prefer China or America...
{99432}{99525}Your fiancée is a fine pianist,|Mr. Massary.
{99805}{99867}What are you lovebirds doing?
{99888}{99941}Come, have your picture taken.
{99943}{100014}Rodin was going|to give you a raise. Did he?
{100024}{100061}He promised, Papa.
{100112}{100161}Does he pay you regularly?
{100189}{100215}Yes.
{100238}{100294}The "Bourgeois of Calais"|are nearly done.
{100348}{100435}What does that|have to do with it?
{100436}{100505}Since you met Rodin...
{100507}{100554}you've done no work of your own.
{100561}{100605}That's not true.
{100607}{100666}He's more concerned|about my future than I am.
{100668}{100697}This is December.
{100721}{100822}If you haven't begun,|you'll miss the Salon.
{100824}{100906}You've exhibited nothing yet|this year.
{100908}{100957}I've learned to work faster|from him.
{100959}{100998}My daughter didn't wait...
{101000}{101041}...for Rodin in order to exist!
{101100}{101136}Don't ever forget...
{101138}{101207}...that we're different.|That we're the Claudels.
{101233}{101299}You always worked faster|and better than others.
{101324}{101391}Remember, Boucher told us...
{101392}{101440}you must exhibit|to become known.
{101441}{101493}There's no other way.
{101495}{101542}I know, Papa.
{101544}{101579}Look at me, darling.
{101581}{101625}Lift your eyes.
{101740}{101827}Your future belongs to you.
{101912}{101942}Also...
{101944}{102050}Don't be seen too much|with Monsieur Rodin.
{102052}{102100}People might gossip.
{106977}{107006}Sorry I'm late.
{107576}{107629}You can see your sister later.
{107631}{107674}She's here for good.
{107740}{107775}Please...
{107836}{107874}Lunch is ready.
{108559}{108622}This lunch meant so much|to Camille.
{108982}{109038}What a cook that Rose is!
{109300}{109340}Winter will be rough.
{109447}{109515}Whenever I'm still hungry|I eat the bread.
{109551}{109599}Thanks, I'm fine.
{109844}{109894}Let's write to my friend...
{109896}{109958}in "Foreign Affairs" together.
{110161}{110191}This way.
{110475}{110554}Madame, I have good news.|You're pregnant.
{112148}{112201}I know you'll overeat again.
{112203}{112249}I despise those people...
{112251}{112304}...and their damned dinners.
{112306}{112387}Those people don't even|understand your work.
{112408}{112459}Let the Mayor of Calais|come here.
{112461}{112531}It's the whole|Town Council of Calais!
{112548}{112617}I can't stand these parties.
{112634}{112688}Go, see your Minister alone.
{112715}{112772}I'm glad I won't be seeing you!
{113936}{113970}Marry me.
{114458}{114492}Dear Rodin...
{114512}{114638}I can't come to Calais.|I have no hat or shoes.
{114640}{114688}So excuse me...
{114690}{114794}and don't accuse me|of bad faith.
{114824}{114879}I began a portrait of you.
{114881}{114998}When it's done, I'll make a mold.
{115000}{115049}When that's dry...
{115051}{115101}I'll just need to|break it open to see you.
{115130}{115159}Camille.
{115196}{115275}I sleep naked...|as if you were here.
{115277}{115357}But when I wake up,|it's not the same.
{115371}{115423}Don't be unfaithful to me.
{116004}{116087}You'll never get him!|He's mine!
{116088}{116154}Where would you be|without your hands?
{116296}{116347}Next time, I'll kill you.
{117364}{117409}Papa, it's for you.
{117580}{117611}Camille has disappeared.
{117632}{117687}She left everything behind.
{117688}{117783}What is it now?|You just got back from Calais...
{117784}{117826}Nobody's seen her in 3 days.
{117828}{117875}There's nothing|I can do tonight.
{117876}{117926}Let him in, if he's here.
{117928}{117959}Leave me in peace!
{119802}{119879}Go to the studio.|Get the others. Run!
{120277}{120323}Striking, isn't it, Limet?
{120324}{120371}Alchemy. Magic.
{120372}{120415}I never saw a self-portrait|like that.
{120416}{120437}So lifelike.
{120454}{120492}A cruel look at yourself...
{120494}{120529}You must look, gentlemen.
{120531}{120588}An artist believes his own eyes.
{120590}{120637}Many pupils have done my bust.
{120639}{120686}This one is the most beautiful.
{120688}{120732}I'll exhibit it everywhere.
{120734}{120796}Imagine! From memory!
{120798}{120831}She did it from memory!
{120857}{120908}She did it in your absence?
{121007}{121069}Miss Claudel|has become a master.
{121089}{121155}She has the talent of a man.
{121157}{121194}She's a witch.
{121280}{121320}It's magnificent.|A premonition.
{121322}{121375}That's how I'll look|in ten years.
{121376}{121412}It's magnificent.
{121494}{121539}Something has happened...
{121566}{121611}Something's wrong.|Where were you, my love?
{121630}{121663}Choose, Rodin.
{121731}{121766}Your wife, or me.
{121996}{122039}Rose is not my wife.
{122064}{122099}What's wrong with you?
{122100}{122153}Jealous of an old attachment?
{122155}{122215}It's not like you and me.
{122217}{122307}You and I are freaks of nature.|We're the same breed.
{122329}{122391}You're dreaming, Rodin.
{122393}{122472}An idyllic|romance in a castle...
{122474}{122539}We're two ghosts in a wasteland.
{122540}{122586}What are you talking about?
{122637}{122662}With you...
{122664}{122741}...I want peace...|oblivion... work...
{122772}{122810}Will you leave her?
{122942}{122990}If only I could, Camille.
{123023}{123063}If only I could.
{123065}{123141}Leave her, I beg you.|Leave her.
{123176}{123236}I'm the one you love.
{123238}{123299}Tell me I'm the one you love.
{123326}{123390}You love me!|Do you? You love me!
{123428}{123506}Don't let the worst|happen to us. Please.
{123572}{123636}There are|different ways of loving.
{123660}{123707}What do you want me to do?
{123709}{123759}Fire her, like a maid?
{123819}{123848}I'll speak to her.
{123868}{123897}Give me time.
{123929}{123982}Give me time to prepare her.
{124023}{124064}I'm all she has.
{124117}{124166}She's the one you love.
{124224}{124253}It's her.
{124296}{124339}Rose is ill, you hear?
{124341}{124378}She's ill.
{124438}{124485}I thought you were different.
{124540}{124570}I'm leaving.
{124596}{124671}Tomorrow I'll send for|my things and my pay.
{124703}{124738}You tyrant!
{124740}{124788}I worked hard for you.
{124790}{124838}Now I'll work for myself.
{125355}{125401}All right, let's go.
{128255}{128324}You move in|and go through my things.
{128412}{128448}You believe in God?
{128540}{128607}If you think I like|being with Catholics!
{128609}{128652}Did you convert?
{128688}{128729}Have you gone crazy?
{128803}{128839}No. I found faith.
{128841}{128933}Why did you hide it|all this time?
{128935}{129035}If you think I haven't been|worrying what Papa would say!
{129078}{129151}"Another of my son's whims!"
{129153}{129235}I was in agony.|You would all have laughed.
{129284}{129362}Remember, the whole family|obeyed you...
{129364}{129441}...when you announced|we should stop attending mass.
{129443}{129508}That's not your only reason|for not telling us...
{129544}{129579}...not the only reason.
{129580}{129663}I want to write.|I want to be successful.
{129823}{129868}It won't be easy...
{129898}{130004}...to be a Catholic, a poet|and a diplomat, all at one time.
{130026}{130084}You can laugh if you like!
{130085}{130132}But the man with no faith...
{130133}{130187}...will never be a great artist.
{130189}{130227}God exists.
{130264}{130319}He saved me from despair...
{130371}{130440}...and I need Him to be myself.
{130500}{130576}I'll be who I am|without any help.
{130578}{130679}I've prayed for you|all year long.
{130736}{130776}I had an abortion, Paul.
{130839}{130871}An abortion!
{131008}{131093}My poor Camille...|Are you going to leave him?
{131150}{131212}Let me stay here a while.
{131214}{131274}I won't bother you.
{131276}{131325}I don't want to go back home.
{131392}{131429}I promise...
{131431}{131475}...I won't see him again.
{131527}{131600}Hail Mary, full of Grace
{131602}{131662}Blessed art Thou among women.
{131664}{131794}Holy Mary, Mother of God,|pray for us sinners...
{133726}{133765}That's her body.
{134223}{134315}I hear the Claudel girl makes|the hands and feet of his statues.
{134673}{134739}Love has|given the old man wings.
{136948}{136982}A card, sir.
{137203}{137265}CAMILLE CLAUDEL|SCULPTOR
{137916}{137982}Where's the beautiful girl?
{138133}{138201}You have a rich imagination|and a steady hand.
{138268}{138308}I must go.
{138373}{138404}Thank you.
{138406}{138436}Eugene Blot.
{138576}{138596}Well?
{138626}{138659}Well...?
{138661}{138715}Well...|nothing but naked rumps...
{138716}{138747}I kissed Sakountala!
{138749}{138798}We all wanted to kiss her.
{138800}{138831}But I did it!
{138833}{138899}Naked rumps pointing toward|Heaven, noses in the sand.
{138922}{138978}I know you heard|horrible things.
{140860}{140887}Kiss me.
{140922}{140951}No comment.
{141271}{141364}Let's be clear: I do the business,|you do the sculpting.
{141399}{141503}I'm sure I can sell|both of these in bronze.
{141523}{141611}I'll make the sales, take|my percentage... and we're even.
{141632}{141692}Of course,|you get the first bronzes.
{141776}{141838}Take this advance.|You need it.
{141868}{141899}Thank you.
{141921}{141963}Thank you, Monsieur Blot.
{142587}{142653}There might be|an official order for you.
{142680}{142717}Do you hear?
{142786}{142836}At least,|go and see Morhardt.
{142984}{143012}Forgive me.
{143308}{143352}Open the door! Camille!
{145649}{145711}Bundle up, Paul.|It's very cold in America.
{145747}{145834}And watch out in the streets.|They have gangsters.
{145836}{145887}Savages... cowboys...
{145889}{145918}Good luck, Paul.
{145974}{146013}God bless you. God keep you.
{146544}{146582}Assert yourself!
{146620}{146656}I'll miss you.
{146696}{146753}I'll try to do well, too.
{146755}{146796}You'll be proud of me.
{146858}{146901}Write to me.
{146903}{146999}We'll be like we used to be.|Like before!
{147542}{147601}Your brother's been sent|to New York.
{147652}{147741}We have decided|to give you your dowry.
{147743}{147823}You've dipped into it|considerably. But, still...
{147824}{147914}At last we're leaving Paris|after those years of hard work...
{147916}{147971}...that poisoned|our tranquility.
{147972}{148057}If you really need to,|come with us to Villeneuve.
{148059}{148151}There's no shame.|Many unmarried girls do it.
{149185}{149238}Do you think she'd agree?
{149240}{149302}She's a considerable sculptor|and...
{149335}{149421}Is she really|working on her own now?
{149423}{149517}I showed her where to find gold,|but the gold she finds is hers.
{149519}{149566}I'd like to interview her.
{153556}{153607}I'm not very cheerful.
{153658}{153715}I've become a stranger|to myself.
{153814}{153873}There's always|something missing.
{153899}{153951}Your voice|has changed the most.
{153973}{154043}Nothing that's monstrous|is foreign to me.
{154045}{154128}You, at least, are used to it.|All your intrigues...
{154129}{154179}You can't deny it.
{154216}{154276}You can be so nasty at times.
{154299}{154372}I find that you're not well.
{154374}{154444}Your "Balzac" is a noble idea,|Auguste Rodin.
{154446}{154511}That's not the general opinion.
{154532}{154624}That statue has made me|the laughing stock of Paris.
{154688}{154751}My Balzac!
{154752}{154823}I'll end up|putting it in my garden!
{155263}{155335}Why don't you touch me?
{155336}{155407}No. Let me discover|your work, will you?
{155423}{155498}Why? Are you afraid|I've surpassed you?
{155499}{155576}No, no. Copied me, perhaps.
{155606}{155640}Calm down...
{155788}{155840}They say you're not well...
{155927}{156022}But when I see|the amount of work!
{156031}{156063}Won't you look?
{156065}{156127}No, I'd rather feel it first.
{156183}{156250}With your courage...|your colossal willpower...
{156328}{156405}You make me want to scream.
{156407}{156490}I feel like I've|brought home a bailiff.
{156797}{156846}No. You can't...
{156991}{157028}You can't...
{157057}{157132}I told you the trouble I've had|over "Balzac."
{157134}{157219}If you complete this one,|there'll be more scandal.
{157239}{157274}How can you reduce...
{157276}{157318}...what we shared|to that image?
{157319}{157409}You show me as a spineless puppet|torn apart by two women.
{157411}{157449}That's a vile caricature!
{157451}{157479}What do you want?
{157481}{157561}I want you to do|what I tell you to do!
{157579}{157597}Exactly!
{157599}{157655}Not do what I'm doing?
{157657}{157729}I've earned the right|to do my own work.
{157731}{157815}If it means ridiculing me,|destroying me...
{157817}{157870}...then you must give it up.
{157903}{157952}Submit all your ideas to me.
{157954}{157999}Don't compare yourself|to me!
{158001}{158020}What?
{158022}{158068}Never!|You're a third-rate sculptor.
{158070}{158128}Then why attack me|so violently?
{158130}{158189}Everything comes from me,|nothing from you.
{158191}{158235}You struggle too much|for your work.
{158236}{158284}It speaks for itself.
{158286}{158313}Why are you jealous?
{158315}{158368}- Jealous?|- Yes.
{158370}{158401}Jealous, me?
{158524}{158591}I make sculptures of life,|not death!
{158614}{158654}You despise life.
{158775}{158818}You search for pain.
{158848}{158896}You get drunk on pain.
{158908}{158950}And you create pain.
{158996}{159055}You portray yourself|as a victim.
{159087}{159161}A martyr.|But you're the one who left me.
{159163}{159229}It was impossible|to live with you!
{159375}{159412}Listen, Camille.
{159414}{159481}The work we did together|was good.
{159531}{159632}I always treated you|as an equal.
{159634}{159698}All the work I did for you|was good!
{159699}{159747}"Miss Claudel, Rodin's pupil!
{159749}{159800}"She picks up Rodin's scraps..."
{159802}{159859}"and crams them into her sculptures!"
{159861}{159924}You allowed them to say it!
{159999}{160034}Oh, God!
{160067}{160101}You're my worst enemy...
{160103}{160138}...I've just realized.
{160140}{160181}You stole it all!
{160183}{160230}My youth, my work! Everything!
{160257}{160294}I've ruined your life?
{160295}{160346}I wish I'd never met you!
{160348}{160401}I'd rather be in an asylum!
{160403}{160483}That's where you'd like to put me!
{160484}{160522}You're completely drunk!
{160523}{160559}Completely drunk.
{160560}{160604}You've started drinking.|Everyone says so.
{160606}{160654}If I didn't drink...
{160655}{160727}they'd all know|you put me in this state.
{160729}{160835}So let them think I'm|in this state because I drink!
{160836}{160915}I'm a well-known professional|sculptor. I'm backing you.
{160917}{160963}I know the fools are|against you.
{160964}{161025}What do you mean, professional?
{161027}{161099}Do you mean|running three studios at once?
{161101}{161192}Socializing instead of|putting your hand in clay?
{161194}{161236}Driving your workers on marble...
{161238}{161294}while you add the finishing touches!
{161295}{161372}As an artist,|I refuse your system!
{161374}{161481}Stop this gossip! Slander!|Stop confusing everything!
{161483}{161507}Confusing!
{161509}{161585}You're confused!|Supporting political hacks...
{161587}{161636}...so they'll defend your work!
{161638}{161698}I'm neither for|nor against Dreyfus!
{161700}{161762}If only you believed|in either side...
{161764}{161818}When I heard|you were pro-Dreyfus...
{161819}{161887}just for your personal gains...
{161888}{161929}...for your Balzac...
{161931}{162023}...so you could finally exhibit,|then I turned against Dreyfus!
{162024}{162051}That's enough!
{162069}{162096}Stop.
{162387}{162428}It's ridiculous!
{162611}{162649}Such a waste!
{162752}{162796}When I met you, you were...
{162823}{162904}...for me, the most|desirable woman in the world.
{162927}{162975}You, who are a sculptor!
{162976}{163033}You caressed my naked stomach...
{163035}{163099}...and didn't even realize|it had changed.
{163398}{163489}Had I known you expected a child|I'd have married you.
{163635}{163689}For years... you didn't want...
{163776}{163819}You never wanted to choose...
{163859}{163915}You never decided anything.
{163916}{163970}I never loved anyone but you.
{164067}{164101}I couldn't share you.
{164103}{164154}It was a struggle for me.
{164555}{164596}What should I tell you?
{164616}{164681}You made a mistake, that's all.
{164898}{164940}It's finished.
{165106}{165214}I don't want any more|complicated emotions...
{165567}{165623}...the tyranny of feelings.
{165645}{165690}I can't anymore.
{165742}{165788}On your deathbed|you'll still hesitate!
{165973}{166007}Why?
{166485}{166514}There's nothing left.
{166516}{166551}Yes, but...
{166624}{166667}What will you do?
{166669}{166710}I need the money.
{166990}{167030}You're crazy!
{167031}{167075}You'll never get it inside.
{167077}{167117}What about the landlord?
{167169}{167264}What about him?|It's only wood.
{167493}{167530}Thank you, Robert.
{167538}{167573}Good-bye...
{167876}{167947}You're wrong to think|it's about you.
{167967}{168063}You're a sculptor, Rodin,|not a sculpture.
{168082}{168113}You ought to know.
{168157}{168242}I am that old woman|with nothing on her bones.
{168275}{168326}And the aging young girl...
{168327}{168369}that's also me.
{168371}{168408}And the man is me, too.
{168426}{168458}Not you.
{168483}{168521}I gave him my toughness.
{168554}{168604}He gave me his emptiness|in return.
{168635}{168691}There you are...|three times me.
{168715}{168793}The Holy Trinity,|trinity of emptiness.
{169260}{169295}How did you know...
{169297}{169374}...there were people|inside the big white rock?
{169546}{169594}You have a stomach ache?
{169595}{169641}My father's a doctor.
{170047}{170072}You lied!
{170074}{170158}You said you wanted|my three figures...
{170160}{170222}for the Universal Exposition!
{170223}{170352}I swear, it was never a question|of the Exposition of 1900.
{170421}{170455}Listen, Miss Claudel...
{170473}{170568}I was the first one who|wrote about you, defended you.
{170570}{170636}I need recognition, not praise!
{170638}{170680}But you have it!
{170682}{170739}The order for "The Age of Maturity"|is official.
{170786}{170859}But not for the|Exposition of 1900.
{170921}{170994}It's a scheme of Rodin's.|I know it!
{170996}{171074}Whenever he can,|Rodin helps you.
{171076}{171148}He respects you deeply|as an artist.
{171150}{171184}He wishes you well.
{171186}{171289}Believe me, I'm in no mood|to be held back by Rodin's gang.
{171291}{171346}He brags about his power.
{171347}{171405}And he prints my portrait|on postcards...
{171407}{171446}against my wishes!
{171448}{171501}And the bust I made of him!
{171503}{171554}He exhibits it anywhere,|in any way, without my consent!
{171556}{171613}His head!|It's all he cares about.
{171615}{171651}And the erotic sketches!
{171653}{171689}You go too far!
{171707}{171739}Rodin isn't your enemy.
{171740}{171792}You must calm down.
{171794}{171852}You've assailed us...
{171854}{171926}with your letters|and demands for too long.
{171955}{171995}Who do you think you are?
{171997}{172085}Don't you know who I am?|Or are you pretending?
{172087}{172158}What kind of behavior is this?|You're crazy!
{172178}{172243}I'm Camille Claudel!
{172245}{172301}And if you don't know it,|I'll show you!
{172399}{172430}Doctor Michaux!
{172456}{172487}Let go of her!
{172489}{172522}Scandalous!
{172546}{172603}I'm Doctor Michaux.|What is this?
{172605}{172637}A search warrant, sir.
{172671}{172718}We're reclaiming state property.
{172719}{172782}It's a plot by the Rodin gang.
{172783}{172831}The State paid for your work.
{172833}{172894}Monsieur Morhardt|gave you the check.
{172895}{172938}I burned the check.
{172995}{173073}Nobody can keep me from|making another one.
{174012}{174051}Capitalist!
{174136}{174189}It's your devil, Camille, again!
{174295}{174352}Exploiter of the poor!
{174354}{174426}You have to come out of|your house now.
{174428}{174479}You hear?
{174481}{174571}You'll have to walk|through garbage to get out.
{174573}{174621}You hear me?
{175302}{175348}It's time we moved.
{177856}{177886}My daughter!
{178210}{178255}It's not possible.
{178410}{178470}Your eyes are dark blue,|my child.
{178519}{178628}You look terrible.|Louise couldn't reach you.
{178651}{178711}Your brother also tried|to see you...
{178712}{178763}during his last visit.
{178765}{178799}He was in Paris?
{179080}{179115}Is that in America?
{179117}{179139}Fou Tcheou.
{179158}{179251}He travels a great deal.|He's a vice consul.
{179253}{179290}It's beautiful.
{179359}{179459}I wanted so much|to go to China with him.
{179711}{179754}He'll be well-known.
{179771}{179817}He's a great poet.
{179854}{179907}I neglected him for too long.
{179950}{179982}I know, Papa.
{180031}{180104}I always took up too much room.
{180210}{180243}Have I disappointed you?
{180279}{180303}Yes...
{180347}{180383}...but I'll always love you.
{180455}{180536}"I wanted not to weep"
{180583}{180716}"and to get up to walk,|but man only goes forward."
{180718}{180758}"Until he has to stop."
{180783}{180893}"And his bones well up|in his eyes, out of that sea..."
{180895}{181003}"which, in all chests,|rises to the same level."
{181048}{181134}"Where did I go wrong?|Where is my fault?"
{181167}{181216}"If they cut off my hands..."
{181241}{181297}"...I'll offer you the stumps."
{181299}{181346}"I'll come toward you..."
{181347}{181440}"On my bones, toward you..."
{181467}{181506}I'm ashamed...
{181567}{181607}...I'm ashamed.
{181895}{181945}Paul has found God.
{182079}{182181}He's come to terms with that.|Good terms.
{182183}{182271}And you, what will you have,|when I'm gone?
{183943}{183979}My dear Paul...
{183980}{184042}I have a lot of new ideas|for you.
{184065}{184155}Three figures listening|to another, behind a screen.
{184173}{184246}A young girl on a bench, crying.
{184247}{184295}Her parents watch, stunned.
{184321}{184391}I get great pleasure|from working.
{184393}{184442}In next year's salon,|the group of three...
{184444}{184525}if I'm done, large scale.
{184527}{184600}And I've another group in mind,|that you'll love.
{184622}{184703}See, it's no longer like Rodin.|And dressed!
{184730}{184788}You never tell me|what you're writing.
{184790}{184844}Any new books?
{184846}{184930}Several friends told me|to buy, "Tete d'Or."
{184965}{185043}It's been terribly cold lately.
{185045}{185101}I keep a fire going all night.
{185103}{185178}If you can spare|any money for heat...
{185179}{185227}it would help.
{185228}{185276}Thank you for the onyx.
{185278}{185333}I hear the crash of green water.
{185335}{185393}Hurry and come see all this.
{185395}{185473}I hold you close. Camille.
{185475}{185530}You're the only one...
{185567}{185623}...to whom I've confided|all this.
{185715}{185758}Don't show this to anyone.
{188010}{188045}Are you drunk?
{188181}{188220}Enough, Camille.
{188247}{188279}Enough!
{188540}{188594}My God, you've changed!
{188785}{188839}Haven't you seen|the river rising?
{188986}{189044}The area has been evacuated.
{189193}{189246}He wants to drown me now.
{189291}{189356}The way you carry on!
{189417}{189495}You refused an order|for ten busts of Rodin!
{189497}{189591}You're officially invited|to Prague with him... you don't go!
{189607}{189673}Have some courage, damn it!
{189675}{189738}Your behavior is irresponsible.
{189766}{189835}You hear? Irresponsible!
{189915}{189963}To complete the picture...
{189965}{190042}...you mail cat shit|to the Minister of Culture...
{190043}{190122}...and accuse Rodin|of stealing the Mona Lisa.
{190138}{190210}Bravo. Very funny.
{190283}{190333}Stop these morbid pranks.
{190335}{190382}Go out! Be seen!
{190472}{190526}React intelligently...
{190527}{190582}instead of burying yourself alive.
{190583}{190618}This is suicide, Camille.
{190631}{190669}I'm afraid.
{190716}{190770}I'm afraid of being robbed!
{190853}{190892}I'm afraid!
{191060}{191126}Everyone is afraid|one time or another.
{191217}{191329}But... with me...|it's all the time.
{191391}{191500}There are people...|who are bothered by me...
{191627}{191755}...who don't forgive me|for being so gifted.
{191767}{191806}No, listen, Camille.
{191839}{191895}We haven't met for a long time.
{191955}{191987}What new treasures!
{192031}{192059}Look...
{192104}{192154}This little piece...
{192210}{192253}...it's monumental!
{192413}{192475}You mean "The Chatterboxes"?
{192477}{192529}You call it that?
{192531}{192576}Or "The Gossips."
{192698}{192717}Sakountala...
{192844}{192874}...in marble.
{192907}{192948}And that little girl...
{193088}{193156}Look,|I'll give you six months...
{193158}{193240}...to create a new piece|for me, large-scale.
{193242}{193290}I'll arrange an exhibition...
{193291}{193354}a one-man show of your work.
{193420}{193474}They'll see how sublime you are.
{193869}{193918}You look like Cinderella.
{193952}{193998}I like Cinderella.
{194366}{194426}It's like the lower depths here.
{194659}{194722}I'll arrange it all.|First, the cats.
{194835}{194882}Don't move. I'll be back.
{194903}{194956}I'll carry you to the boat.
{196023}{196138}Camille Claudel is the first to|create this type of inner sculpture.
{196159}{196272}Critics have often|compared her art...
{196274}{196367}...to that of another,|whose name I detest...
{196369}{196451}In fact, there is no similarity|whatever...
{196453}{196506}between the two.
{196527}{196635}The art of that sculptor|is the heaviest there is.
{196637}{196739}Some of his figures can't even|get free of the clay...
{196741}{196805}...in which they are petrified.
{196855}{196905}When they aren't crawling...
{196907}{197006}- hugging the mud|in a kind of erotic furor...
{197008}{197088}...then each, clasping another|body, seeks to recreate...
{197090}{197136}...the primitive mass.
{197138}{197252}Impenetrable, they repel|the light... like a thick wall.
{198263}{198304}She's frightening!
{198448}{198502}How embarrassing for her brother.
{198600}{198684}You're a wonderful poet,|Monsieur Claudel.
{199074}{199139}You've seen "The Gossips"?|It's so small...
{199141}{199190}...it fits in your hand,|like a secret.
{199233}{199298}Eugene Blot, thank you!
{199345}{199379}It's a triumph!
{199482}{199553}She doesn't have a style...
{199729}{199770}Of course she's eccentric...
{199771}{199821}It's from Camille.
{199823}{199909}She made that dress|especially for the occasion.
{199911}{199954}A circus!
{199955}{200008}Nothing ever comes|out of a whirlwind...
{200010}{200044}...except trash.
{200046}{200139}Still, Camille's work isn't at all|like Rodin's sleazy pawing.
{200158}{200230}Getting over Rodin has been|hard on her, you know.
{200254}{200338}She staked everything on Rodin,|and she lost everything.
{200383}{200414}My sister.
{200456}{200482}My sister...
{200513}{200570}...is a mystery in full light.
{200599}{200677}There's a way to approach|a mystery... gently...
{200679}{200745}I'm leaving, Blot!
{200775}{200826}Without saying good-bye to her?
{202423}{202462}The reviews were mostly good.
{202530}{202597}They only panned your "Perseus."
{202637}{202680}They found it too disturbing.
{202721}{202780}Some felt you portrayed yourself...
{202782}{202839}as having a severed head.
{202857}{202915}They've no right|to criticize my statue.
{202917}{202951}You've struggled alone.
{202953}{203037}You're the most|authentic sculptor I know.
{203088}{203132}Just disregard|the salon clique.
{203134}{203165}I sold nothing...
{203209}{203267}...but I will.|I'm not discouraged.
{203301}{203404}Your work can't help but touch|collectors in the end, because...
{203406}{203437}...it tears my heart out.
{203497}{203589}They scoff at you because|they can't destroy you.
{203658}{203727}Genius always terrifies people.
{203729}{203790}I should have bought|dresses, hats, instead of...
{203792}{203872}...indulging my passion|for dubious edifices.
{203910}{203990}Your art is so great,|nobody understands it anymore.
{204627}{204673}I love you, Blot.
{204771}{204841}Just send back|the works in plaster.
{204911}{204967}Keep the marble pieces.
{204969}{205017}Keep the bronzes, too.
{207152}{207209}You go, Robert, talk to her.
{207358}{207389}It's Robert!
{207495}{207539}Open up!
{207558}{207594}You! Open up!
{207643}{207715}A shame, using a child.|Robert, where's your dad?
{207717}{207789}All they do is sleep!|I am a sculptor, sir!
{207791}{207863}I get my ideas at night.|That's it! Good-bye, Robert.
{212665}{212773}MARCH 3, 1913
{212797}{212896}When I think of|how he suffered...
{212898}{213005}...when he learned the truth|about her and Rodin!
{213007}{213113}Such arrogance! Living|with him like a kept woman!
{213115}{213189}I don't even dare say|what I think!
{213191}{213257}She abused us!
{213301}{213383}Still,|I can't abandon my daughter.
{213385}{213438}Something must be done quickly.
{213525}{213575}"I, the undersigned,|doctor of medicine..."|MARCH 8, 1913
{213577}{213610}"...certify that Camille Claudel..."
{213611}{213653}"...suffers from|severe mental problems."
{213655}{213747}"That she wears rags...|certainly never washes herself...
{213749}{213798}"That she has sold|almost all her furniture..."
{213800}{213914}"...although she receives from her|family... who also pay for her rent..."
{213954}{214006}"...200 francs per month...
{214007}{214079}"with which she could live|comfortably..."
{214080}{214154}"That she lives in isolation,|in a locked room, without air...
{214156}{214256}"...having sealed the windows|several months ago."
{214258}{214299}She amounted to nothing.
{214329}{214389}I amounted to something.|She didn't.
{214391}{214488}"She evidently is still|terrified of Rodin's gang."
{214490}{214550}All the gifts Nature gave her...
{214552}{214604}brought only unhappiness.
{214636}{214704}It's a total catastrophe.|My sister is swallowed up.
{214706}{214788}"...and a danger to her neighbor|necessitates her confinement..."
{214790}{214832}"...to a mental hospital."
{215154}{215250}MARCH 10, 1913
{216821}{216886}All these ordeals in one week.
{216911}{216987}The death of my husband...|my daughter...
{217690}{217734}It's horrible.
{217783}{217846}When she's better,|you can take her home...
{219848}{219910}My little Paul...
{219912}{219975}You came to see me in May...
{219977}{220032}...and I made you promise...
{220034}{220098}not to neglect me so terribly.
{220127}{220218}Madhouses are made|to inflict suffering.
{220219}{220267}It can't be helped...
{220269}{220326}...especially if|you never see anyone.
{220328}{220389}They try to force me|to sculpt here.
{220415}{220494}They don't succeed,|so they make trouble for me.
{220515}{220562}Don't forget, Paul...
{220564}{220627}your sister is in prison|with madwomen.
{220659}{220707}Mama wrote the doctor...
{220709}{220768}that I mean to harm you.
{220770}{220870}That I detest you and|am out to hurt you.
{220872}{220902}It's not true.
{220925}{220998}I wish she would take me|to Villeneuve with her.
{221029}{221140}Do you think I enjoy spending|months, years...
{221142}{221219}like this, without any news,|or hope?
{221237}{221302}Where does such ferocity|come from?
{221304}{221388}How did they manage|to change you so?
{221390}{221439}I'd really like to know.
{221459}{221526}You might as well|send me to Siberia.
{221555}{221620}Did you take care of my things?
{221622}{221687}Are they in Villeneuve?
{221689}{221778}Be careful they don't fall|into Rodin's hands.
{221779}{221853}He's so afraid|I might come back.
{221855}{221960}That's why he's keeping me here,|isn't it, Paul?
{221984}{222098}I would so like to go home|and close the door tightly.
{222133}{222239}I don't know if I'll be able|to realize this dream...
{222240}{222294}...to be home.
{222349}{222447}Oh, God,|I wish I were in Villeneuve.
{222468}{222534}Your sister in exile.
{222574}{222618}Because of the war...
{222619}{222691}...Camille Claudel was transferred|to the asylum at Montdevergues...
{222693}{222735}...on September 9, 1914.
{222737}{222836}She died there on October 19, 1943,|after thirty years of confinement.
