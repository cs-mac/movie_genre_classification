have been taken from me with one blow.</i>

4

<i>I went back to smoking, an invitation
the death of his arms wide open.</i>

5
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:30,438
<i>I feel more alone in this world
I was like never before.</i>

6
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:35,962
<i>I moved closer
my sister for support.</i>

7
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:41,899
<i>My editor thought that buying this
house would be a distraction from my pain.</i>

8
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:46,380
<i>An obvious attempt to inspire me
end a long-delayed romance.</i>

9
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:51,225
<i>I'm still amazed at how
incredibly cheap this house.</i>

10
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:53,881
<i>Even for small-town values.</i>

11
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:57,945

I hope to be taking the right decision.</i>

14 YEARS LATER

14
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:58,388
Where the hell are you?

15
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:02,451
- Sarah?
- What now?

16
00:03:04,431 --> 00:03:06,931
- Sarah!
- You go, Maggie!

17
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,787
Where are you looking at?

18
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:24,279
Here you are.

19
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:30,166
I'm so attached to you.

20
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:33,709
My God.

21
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,615
As you climbed up
here up so easily?

22
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:44,597
- What are you doing?
- Just look at some old stuff.

23
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:51,055
You know, do not cost anything to call me
mother once in a while. What are you looking?

24
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,818
You must always be
espiolhar to everything I do?

25
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:57,776
I'm only seeing the
old stuff from Uncle Michael.

26
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:01,526
What?

27
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:03,924
I miss him, yes?

28
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:09,029
This is a very valuable antique.

29
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:13,196
And I know that Uncle Michael would want
we had very careful with it.

30
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,478
In case you forgetting,
he gave it to me.

31
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:20,333
I just think you should not use while
you're not a little more responsible.

32
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,876
What age do you think I am?
I'll be late ...

33
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:29,137
Where you going?

34
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:37,890
Sarah.

35
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:41,588
Where you going?
When are you coming?

36
00:04:42,057 --> 00:04:44,037
I told you,
I will spend the night at Emily's house.

37
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,641
No. Do not tell me that.

38
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:50,392
I'm tired of you always have to try
have in my life. I'm out of here.

39
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,851
Sarah!

40
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,965
This conversation is not over yet!

41
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:01,854
Now you can stop listening.

42
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:04,562
- Where you going?
- Anywhere but here.

43
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,720
- I thought we were going out together ...
- Jill, we may go another day, okay?

44
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:14,408
Stop arming you into silly.
I have to go.

45
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:57,542
Damn!
You gave me a cagaça!

46
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:01,190
Sorry, where were you? It was supposed
end we found an hour ago.

47
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,846
Yes, I know. Maggie was
again to be herself.

48
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,409
Goat.

49
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,431
So, you brought it?

50
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,201
Yes ..

51
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,921
Beautiful.

52
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:24,788
Creed, this place still
I fear hell of a mess.

53
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:28,174
- What?
- Put yourself.

54
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:30,935
I am sure that
was better when your uncle lived here.

55
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:34,373
Yes, I know, not applicable.

56
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,915
Okay, let's go.

57
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:41,770
Come on!
Come on, Sarah.

58
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:47,085
Where'd you get the necklace?

59
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,376
It was my uncle.

60
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:51,617
It seems an age or so.

61
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,127
Yes

62
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:55,681
Maggie was
tease me for having it taken away.

63
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,609
What is her problem?

64
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,171
Same as always.

65
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:03,598
Attempts to control my life because
basically has no control over his own.

66
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,662
- The same crap as always.
- You know what? Do not worry.

67
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:09,485
Because I'm here.

68
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:10,892
That's what I'm here.

69
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:14,435
I'm here to
remember that we still live ...

70
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,821
a city of shit
where there is nothing to do.

71
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:19,592
Nothing to do ...

72
00:07:19,643 --> 00:07:21,258
Thank you.

73
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,343
I think.

74
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:29,699
What abnormal.

75
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,573
Let's get outta here.

76
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:45,430
Give me your hand.

77
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,328
Can you run?

78
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:53,558
Thankfully,
because we have a lot to run.

79
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,270
- What do they want?
- To you.

80
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:12,885
- Stay close to me.
- What do we do?

81
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:14,865
- We must get away from the streets.
- How?

82
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,896
We have to go through them.
Are you ready?

83
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:20,073
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

84
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:21,688
Now!

85
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:37,525
- Jill, I'll leave.
- Mom, this television does not work.

86
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:41,380
The cable must be
probably off, dear.

87
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:44,195
Are you sure you'll be okay?

88
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:47,006
Leave off,
I'm almost 15 years.

89
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:53,675
Okay, I'll have my phone with me.
If you need me, call me, okay?

90
00:08:58,259 --> 00:08:59,406
Jill?

91
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,281
Okay! Goodbye.

92
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:42,176
Come on ...

93
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,802
Unbelievable.

94
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:06,711
Shit!

95
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:19,684
Come back soon.

96
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:22,653
Jill, make sure that all
doors and windows are locked.

97
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:24,737
Why? What's up?

98
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:28,227
- Did something happen?
- Do it! Now!

99
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:31,302
Shit ...

100
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,489
Jill will check
the back door.

101
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,067
- Damn! You gave me a cagaça.
- Attention to language, girl.

102
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,141
Come on.

103
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:00,681
My god! Lower yourself.

104
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,808
Get down and stays that way.

105
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:10,061
Right ...

106
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:14,123
We must find
a safer place.

107
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,311
Mom, why do not you tell me
what happens?

108
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:18,291
Because I do not know what is happening.

109
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,167
Come on.

110
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,274
And the car?

111
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,607
Does not work. Go up the stairs.

Hello

123
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,876
Sarah, how are you?

124
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,272
Can you say it?

125
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:05,137
Hello

126
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:22,954
It was not easy when the father of Sarah
left us last year.

127
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,757
I thought my world would end.

128
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:31,863
I think what
I'm trying to say is that ...

129
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,863
... know how it feels to be alone.

130
00:13:40,614 --> 00:13:42,384
Thanks.

131
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:53,169
Mom.

132
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,410
What are you doing?

133
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:59,055
Mommy will catch you!

134
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:02,910
Mommy will catch you.
He picked up his girl!

135

In the old church!
There should be safe!

137
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,178
- It's too far!
- We're almost there!

138
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:36,591
They can not enter here.

139
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,611
This place is too
strong for them.

Sarah.

142
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:56,021
I still think that
this is just a bad dream.

143
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,553
It's more than you can imagine.

144

145
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,181

You appear out of nowhere ...

150
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:29,883
Sorry about your friend.

the ceiling of my room. </ i></i>

163
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:19,438
<i> curious about what would
decided to investigate. </ i></i>

164
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:22,044
<i> I found nothing. </ i></i>

165
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,346
<i>However  ...</ i></i>

166
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:26,940
<i> ... felt some
thing was watching me. </ i></i>

167
00:19:28,712 --> 00:19:32,671
<i>I'm always a
feeling uncomfortable in this house. </ i></i>

168
00:19:32,984 --> 00:19:35,329
<i> As if I belonged. </ i></i>

169
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,307
<i> constantly ...</ i></i>

170
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:39,652
<i> ... I want to remember it. </ i></i>

171
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:45,800
Get down!

172
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,272
Down! Go!

173
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,941
Listen.

174
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:06,754
With attention, child.

175
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:09,151
Who are you?

176
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,359
I'm Mathias,
the necromancer of darkness.

177
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:18,633
But your concern
should be with what you have.

178
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:20,299
Do not know what you're talking about.

179
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:24,883
The rune placed Sayorlean
inside of your silver necklace.

180
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:28,373
Returns it.

181
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:32,021
I do not understand.

182
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:35,251
It is precisely for
That must be returned.

183
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:38,272
You do not understand its power.

184
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,282
Not with your partner
Abes of the sword.

185
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,171
Stay away.

186
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:52,911
Calm down, child.
Will you give me the rune.

187
00:21:53,537 --> 00:21:55,358
What makes you think that I ...

188
00:21:57,287 --> 00:21:59,839
Ma can not take, do you?

189
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:04,372
Now only you have the
power to end this chaos.

190
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,373
Return the paste to the mansion Ekling

191
00:22:09,424 --> 00:22:13,227
and all this madness will end.

192
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:16,874
The necklace belongs to me.

193
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:18,437
It belonged to my uncle.

194
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:22,813
Stolen from me by it
and so their blood line

195
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,845
is cursed forever.

196
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,136
Give me the necklace

197
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:32,139
and I will spare your
family curse it carries.

198
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:34,482
And if it fails?

199
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:41,515
Then I'll send the very essence
with the nightmares that are created

200
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:45,526
until they tear
your decaying flesh.

201
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:52,507
Sarah.

202
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:54,277
I am.

203
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,967
We must continue,
there is an exit on the other side.

204
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:02,302
Where are we?

205
00:23:03,656 --> 00:23:07,407
Beneath the city. An old camera
rest for church members.

206
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:11,261
- I lived in this city ever since ...
- Ali ahead!

207
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:13,710
What? What is that?

208
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:25,431
- We gotta get outta here!
- Why? What is it?

209
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:38,246
Do not look back!

210
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,372
- Where are we?
- For output.

211
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:45,852
- We have to climb!
- Jacob!

212
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,108
Do not look down!

213
00:24:51,544 --> 00:24:52,846
Ali

214
00:25:07,745 --> 00:25:10,663
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, it's someone at the door.

215
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:16,185
- I see.
- There may be another thing like that.

216
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,478
- It could be your sister.
- Mom, do not go.

217
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:21,706
Jill, I have to see if it is Sarah.

218
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:24,312
Stay here.

219
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:48,081
Sarah?

220
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:50,581
My God ...

221
00:26:50,685 --> 00:26:52,404
Stay away.

222
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:16,004
Come on,
here we are not safe.

223
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,102
What are you ...

224
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:23,765
Go, go.

225
00:27:41,946 --> 00:27:43,718
Are you sure we
be safe up here?

226
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:45,436
Because if not, we're stuck.

227
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:47,989
Of course we'll be safe.

228
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:17,683
I do not see
these things around.

229
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:20,184
Never trust in your eyes.

230
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,788
All those cries echoing.

231
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:28,101
Lower yourself.

232
00:28:28,935 --> 00:28:30,447
They're everywhere!

233
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:32,218
They are hunting us.

234
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:34,561
- They see us?
- Head toward the woods.

235
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:02,068
Stopped.

236
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:04,985
Can not cross.

237
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,872
Look at them.
Whence come all?

238
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:15,091
We need to continue.

239
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:55,830
You must be kidding.

240
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,060
We have to go through.

241
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,634
Already crossed half.

242
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:53,447
They're here.

243
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,157
There, there, did not you?

244
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:01,314
Run to the other side
and not look back.

245
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,773
- Jacob ...
- Now.

246
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,774
Continues!

247
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:32,935
Gone are all.

248
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,394
I know.

249
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:38,978
Can we rest now?
We went to run all night.

250
00:31:41,896 --> 00:31:43,563
There under.

251
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,077
A night with a sky so beautiful.
It makes no sense what is happening.

252
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:01,275
Get it fast!

253
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,838
- What?
- Now!

254
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:04,348
Why?

255
00:32:06,171 --> 00:32:09,245
It's impenetrable,
even for a sword.

256
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:12,943
Body contact, was well
they knew where we were.

257
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:17,789
I have this forever and now you're
say who persecute us because of it?

258
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:20,758
- When was the first time that you used?
- Just tonight, but I ...

259
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:23,467
It's me missing something?

260
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:29,250
And who the hell are you? And how did you know the
passage beneath the church?

261
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,313
And how you were there in
just when I was attacked?

262
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,438
Not everything is as it seems.

263
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,054
Then answer it.

264
00:32:39,512 --> 00:32:41,387
Are you following me?

265
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:46,597
Are you hiding something from me.

266
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:48,264
And to tell the truth ...

267
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:50,244
... scare me.

268
00:32:53,787 --> 00:32:56,599
Got something to see
with all this?

269
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:02,486
Yes

270
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,560
In what?

271
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:11,604
My family was
murdered in this city.

272
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:39,942
<i> I felt there was
something wrong with the house </ i></i>

273
00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:42,443
<i> in the day that I and the
My family went to live there. </ i></i>

274
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:13,022
<i> found an old diary that contained
symbols etched into the pages. </ i></i>

275
00:34:13,027 --> 00:34:15,471
<i>It was hidden under
the loft floor. </ i></i>

276
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:20,264
<i>There  spells, each with the objective
to induce or protect from evil. </ i></i>

277
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,390
<i>This is the source
the power of the necromancer. </ i></i>

278
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:25,734
Necromancer?

279
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:30,579
A magician who can awaken and communicate
with the dead through symbols.

280
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:34,538
Then this ...

281
00:34:35,163 --> 00:34:38,601
... necromancer is responsible
for all this?

282
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:42,561
He is able to
create a real nightmare.

283
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,645
You saw it. When?

284
00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:56,522
Beneath the church.

285
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:59,648
He said his name is Mathias.

286
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:02,356
I did not know what to believe, not
know why you were protecting me ...

287
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:04,024
What did he say?

288
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:05,950
What ...

289
00:35:06,419 --> 00:35:08,660
... the necklace is yours to him.

290
00:35:09,546 --> 00:35:12,150
The diary was
designs that stone e. ..

291
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:14,600
... a name for herself,
Sayorlean the rune.

292
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:16,942
Gave the necromancer power
to control the day and night.

293
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,444
Each night he stays
stronger with his control.

294
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:25,175
If he makes the day into night,
this town will not survive.

295
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:39,344
My Uncle Michael
let me die before.

296
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:42,105
How did you get that necklace?

297
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:44,866
I do not know.

298
00:35:45,334 --> 00:35:47,627
I was very small.

299
00:35:48,095 --> 00:35:49,868
Where were you living?

300
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,097
At the mansion Ekling
where you found me.

301
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:56,744
My parents were murdered
shortly after I discovered the diary.

302
00:35:58,514 --> 00:35:59,818
When?

303
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,526
It seems like yesterday.

304
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,799
Did not know
the house had been sold ...

305
00:36:07,163 --> 00:36:08,882
That was quick.

306
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:18,311
Maggie should already be
going on because of me.

307
00:36:20,602 --> 00:36:22,947
- Maggie?
- My mother, I ...

308
00:36:25,188 --> 00:36:27,271
... I refuse to call it that.

309
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:30,398
And Jill, my sister.
Is with her.

310
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:35,659
At least now
I do not have to deal with them.

311
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,046
I envy you for credentials.

312
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:52,328
What happened?

313
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:01,759
Left ...

314
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,511
You think this will end?

315
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:23,847
Everything has to end, Sarah.

316
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:33,537
You better get some rest.

317
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:37,548
Let's wait until the morning.

318
00:38:07,293 --> 00:38:09,481
Mother? Father?

319
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,403
Anna!

320
00:39:11,317 --> 00:39:13,037
What now?

321
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:36,428
What the hell she wants now?

322
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:41,378
- Hello
- Hello, Maggie.

323
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,023
We brought you some cookies.

324
00:39:46,794 --> 00:39:48,254
Thanks.

325
00:39:49,712 --> 00:39:51,065
They ...

326
00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:53,099
... seem to be very good.

327
00:39:53,203 --> 00:39:54,713
Can we come?

328
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:57,525
Sure they can.

329
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,164
So ...

330
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:11,486
... what brings you here?
- I thought you wanted to get away

331
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,051
and go do something.

332
00:40:13,988 --> 00:40:18,520
I have not felt comfortable
get out and do great things ...

333
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:20,136
... lately.

334
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:22,010
Your editor did you get
closed here?

335
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,303
No, I have been to ignore it ...

336
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:26,960
Do not touch that!

337
00:40:29,408 --> 00:40:31,076
No matter.

338
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,774
Sorry. I do not know what ...

339
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:38,056
... is happening to me lately.

340
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:40,817
Michael, are you okay?

341
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:42,849
Yes, I'm just ...

342
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:47,224
... a little cranky lately.
That's it.

343
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:49,569
I understand.

344
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:52,643
So ...

345
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:56,029
... what you been up to?
- I. ..

346
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,269
Can I show you.

347
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,727
Okay.

348
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:02,019
Look at this.

349
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,651
Saw it?

350
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:31,609
How did you?

351
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:35,621
You see this? I found it ...

352
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:37,653
... in the attic ...

353
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:40,830
... beneath the floorboards
and has all these ...

354
00:41:41,508 --> 00:41:45,468
... explanations of how to do
a date different spells e. ..

355
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:47,239
Michael ...

356
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:50,050
... this is not good.

357
00:41:50,103 --> 00:41:52,344
What do you mean?

358
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:56,720
- What do you think I'm doing?
- This is not correct.

359
00:41:57,136 --> 00:42:02,241
Maggie, this is my opportunity
to do something extraordinary.

360
00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:10,785
You know, it's a shame that your
limited mind can not see it.

361
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,307
I think we'd better go.

362
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,277
I agree.

363
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:22,142
You know what, Maggie?

364
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:26,831
Not even
I invited you to come here.

365
00:42:38,604 --> 00:42:40,114
Sarah.

366
00:42:40,635 --> 00:42:42,042
Yes?

367
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:44,073
Gotta go.

368
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:03,557
All disappeared.

369
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:06,422
The necromancer does not
has control during the day.

370
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:10,591
Last night in Ekling ...

371
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:12,882
... why were there?

372
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:18,196
To stem the evil.

373
00:43:19,446 --> 00:43:22,103
But what makes
this house so dangerous?

374
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:26,583
It is where the
Mathias lived there years ago.

375
00:43:28,198 --> 00:43:31,219
Nobody there is welcome
provided that the condition complained.

376
00:43:34,293 --> 00:43:35,959
It's funny.

377
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:38,461
When I was little, they told me
Always stay away from that place.

378
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:41,325
I always thought
nothing more than an urban myth.

379
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,619
Look.

380
00:43:50,495 --> 00:43:53,256
It's almost as if she
was still in pain.

381
00:43:55,027 --> 00:43:56,798
We must continue.

382
00:44:00,185 --> 00:44:02,372
I do not want this to happen.

383
00:44:04,456 --> 00:44:07,061
Promise me
if this happens, shoot me.

384
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,603
I'll take you home safely.

385
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:16,542
Do not believe I'm saying, but
I really miss Maggie and Jill.

386
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,625
What happens if they
become one of those things?

387
00:44:18,631 --> 00:44:20,137
I kill them.

388
00:44:45,924 --> 00:44:48,424
- Jill, dear.
- My God ...

389
00:44:49,258 --> 00:44:51,237
It's okay.
Just me.

390
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:53,790
What a fucking nightmare!

391
00:45:16,972 --> 00:45:18,742
Is it safe?

392
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:21,349
Yes

393
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:24,213
Down, but see where you put your feet.

394
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:37,706
Be careful.

395
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:10,057
This is so disgusting.

396
00:46:10,213 --> 00:46:11,881

Terhael ... appears.

422
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:52,581
Have got to be
My eyes and ears

423
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:54,976
and it rewards me with something.

424
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:58,256
I have no powers
until they recover the rune.

425
00:47:58,315 --> 00:48:02,113
I was robbed by a girl.

426
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:05,551
She travels with a companion.

427
00:48:06,072 --> 00:48:07,531
Kill them.

428
00:48:07,739 --> 00:48:09,822
And retrieve the rune.

429
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:27,379
If we are around, we lose the light.

430
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,149
What?

431
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:17,078
Run!

432
00:49:29,944 --> 00:49:32,133
What the hell is that?

433
00:50:08,391 --> 00:50:09,901
Shit.

434
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:29,438
We must come to that barn!

435
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:11,009
How do we go from here?

436
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:14,187
No. .. I can not stand ...

437
00:51:14,192 --> 00:51:16,792
Already can not stand the noise.

438
00:51:16,797 --> 00:51:19,137
We'll succeed
I swear I will.

439
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:24,658
<i> July 5. </ i></i>

440
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:28,617
<i> This is my first attempt

for a business?

449
00:52:28,635 --> 00:52:32,745
<i> I had the clear impression that
he had a twinge of remorse </ i></i>

451
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:39,726
<i> So
I offered him another drink. </ i></i>

452
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:03,743
She descends.

453
00:53:05,096 --> 00:53:07,909
How about another drink
while you wait?

454
00:53:09,993 --> 00:53:11,296
Thanks.

455
00:53:29,895 --> 00:53:31,769
You do not drink anything?

456
00:53:31,873 --> 00:53:33,958
No, I do not drink.

457
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:35,990
I quit drinking ...

458
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:40,105
It's the only thing for which I live.

459
00:53:42,188 --> 00:53:44,324
After a drunk ...

460
00:53:45,314 --> 00:53:47,396
... have killed my family ...

461
00:53:48,127 --> 00:53:51,045
It changed my
perspective on things.

462
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:57,608
The worst part is that ...

463
00:53:57,921 --> 00:54:00,942
... he got away
because of one detail.

464
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:03,963
And walked free.

465
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,673
What the hell is this?

466
00:54:07,298 --> 00:54:10,527
Do not say anything?
Only by chance?

467
00:54:15,164 --> 00:54:17,197
How did it feel ...

468
00:54:19,643 --> 00:54:21,780
... to kill my family ...

469
00:54:22,198 --> 00:54:24,489
... and destroy my life?

470
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,720
Listen ...

471
00:54:32,824 --> 00:54:35,013
What the hell is going on here?

472
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,555
It was an accident.

473
00:54:40,326 --> 00:54:41,940
I'm not here ...

474
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:45,171
... to apologize
for your family.

475
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:48,661
I'm out of here.

476
00:54:50,225 --> 00:54:51,995
Not with life.

477
00:54:54,287 --> 00:54:55,747
What?

478
00:54:56,528 --> 00:54:58,403
You'll stab me?

479
00:55:01,268 --> 00:55:03,352
I already did.

480
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,353
What the hell?

481
00:55:53,572 --> 00:55:55,135
This is it.

482
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,157
Sarah.

483
00:56:03,522 --> 00:56:05,345
We must leave here.

484
00:56:06,856 --> 00:56:09,199
And if that thing is still there?

485
00:56:12,222 --> 00:56:14,097
We can not wait for the night.

486
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:10,673
I am disappointed, my servant.

487
00:57:11,245 --> 00:57:13,119
Whither fled?

488
00:57:27,706 --> 00:57:28,905
Come.

489
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,355
The Malyhne awaits us.

490
00:58:57,988 --> 00:59:00,071
Okay, this is the last.

491
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:02,052
Give me a hand?

492
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:04,863
Jill?

493
00:59:06,948 --> 00:59:08,198
Jill?

494
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:11,897
Jill?

495
00:59:15,544 --> 00:59:16,742
Jill?

496
00:59:19,451 --> 00:59:24,244
And some of the blood line of Michael.

497
00:59:26,431 --> 00:59:27,577
Mother!

498
00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:29,766
<i> July 9. </ i></i>

499
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:33,933
<i>They spent three days since
invoking Sylathus. </ i></i>

500
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:36,434
<i>I fear for my safety
because both the demons </ i></i>

501
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:39,820
<i> disappeared in
dark confines of the house. </ i></i>

502
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,987
<i> I wonder why
reason has not killed me. </ i></i>

503
00:59:44,143 --> 00:59:46,592
<i> What are you waiting for? </ i></i>

504
01:00:36,551 --> 01:00:38,010
Michael?

505
01:00:38,947 --> 01:00:41,135
Hello, enters.

506
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,513
Want a glass of water?

507
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:52,908
- Water ...
- Yes, water is fine.

508
01:00:52,913 --> 01:00:55,253
- Okay, I will get.
- Thanks.

509
01:00:56,764 --> 01:01:00,307
Not expecting to see you,
but I'm glad you left home.

510
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:10,725
Hello

511
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:18,070
Sorry ...
you can not come to know.

512
01:01:18,748 --> 01:01:20,415
I will miss you.

513
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,117
Will always be safe.

514
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,430
Shit.

515
01:01:40,419 --> 01:01:41,826
Here you go.

516
01:01:42,086 --> 01:01:43,806
Are you okay?

517
01:01:44,588 --> 01:01:45,941
I'm fine.

518
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:48,963
Toma.

519
01:01:49,015 --> 01:01:50,631
Michael?

520
01:01:53,026 --> 01:01:55,736
It's a gift for Sarah.
Give him ...

521
01:01:57,818 --> 01:02:00,164
Gives you only when you
old enough.

522
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:01,569
Okay ...

523
01:02:09,123 --> 01:02:10,843
Just want to say ...

524
01:02:12,405 --> 01:02:14,178
... I regret that.

525
01:02:14,594 --> 01:02:18,709
Michael, it's okay.
I'm just worried about you.

526
01:02:19,178 --> 01:02:20,949
Gotta go.

527
01:02:56,062 --> 01:02:57,312
No, wait.

528
01:02:57,317 --> 01:02:58,896
Maggie?

529
01:03:07,209 --> 01:03:11,065
The whole family together again.

530
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,564
Damn you!

531
01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:16,170
You chose your own destiny.

532
01:03:20,545 --> 01:03:22,838
I advise you ...

533
01:03:22,941 --> 01:03:25,651
... for the safety of
your family ...

534
01:03:25,704 --> 01:03:29,194
... return it to the rune Sayorlean.

535
01:03:31,382 --> 01:03:35,392
- I lost it!
- Very foolish decision.

536
01:03:35,653 --> 01:03:39,040
It was her only hope.

537
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,218
Remove her legs.

538
01:03:47,374 --> 01:03:48,937
So ...

539
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:51,387
... the child returns.

540
01:03:53,158 --> 01:03:55,606
The sword of Abes.
Strip it to him.

541
01:04:12,068 --> 01:04:14,620
- Leave her alone!
- Come on.

542
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:16,913
Come on.

543
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:53,899
What ...

544
01:04:54,213 --> 01:04:56,609
... is more valuable to you?

545
01:04:57,494 --> 01:04:59,108
The rune ...

546
01:04:59,318 --> 01:05:01,975
... or the life of your sister?

547
01:05:02,756 --> 01:05:05,360
Sarah, do not do.

548
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:09,736
You promise that the loose?

549
01:05:10,518 --> 01:05:12,966
I give you my word.

550
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,949
Please!

551
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:31,252
Let her go!

552
01:05:31,825 --> 01:05:35,263
Do you know where to find us.

553
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:37,451
So long.

554
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:43,181
Jill!

555
01:05:49,224 --> 01:05:50,996
Sarah ...

556
01:05:52,143 --> 01:05:53,809
... what have you done?

557
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:55,528
She is my sister.

558
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:08,292
- She will be fine.
- Where to take?

559
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:13,918
Back to the mansion Ekling.

560
01:06:27,462 --> 01:06:30,796
Do not say anything, I have
for taking that horrible place.

561
01:06:30,801 --> 01:06:33,141
- You can not.
- She is my sister.

562
01:06:33,146 --> 01:06:35,277
You have no chance to get back there.

563
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:39,132
She's all alone
without anyone to help.

564
01:06:40,851 --> 01:06:42,777
Will you get it?

565
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:51,946
Do not leave me much choice.

566
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:58,198
Sorry no
have trusted you before.

567
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:11,118
Will I ever see you?

568
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:17,578
Remember.

569
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:21,224
How could I forget?

570
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:26,747
Go inside.

571
01:07:32,893 --> 01:07:34,664
For luck.

572
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:44,354
Farewell ...

573
01:08:08,734 --> 01:08:11,340
I have to finish with
what started it.

574
01:08:26,865 --> 01:08:28,062
Mathias ...

575
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:31,657
I suppose not
necessary introductions.

576
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:35,823
Leave behind the texts blacks knowing
that would guarantee my resurrection.

577
01:08:35,876 --> 01:08:40,096
My predestined
tormentor and savior ...

578
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,753
Give me the rune.

579
01:08:43,274 --> 01:08:47,077
And I convey unto thee his
real power

580
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:50,462
that never was
described in my writing.

581
01:08:50,618 --> 01:08:53,798
- Do not can have.
- I can be quite ...

582
01:08:53,953 --> 01:08:55,723
... convincing.

583
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:03,799
I'm not afraid of you.

584
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:07,549
I learned how to destroy it,
you idiot!

585
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:26,617
- Selaste your own destiny.
- I saved my soul ...

586
01:09:27,294 --> 01:09:30,211
... and destroy her with this spell.

587
01:09:30,217 --> 01:09:32,295
Are you sure?

588
01:09:32,712 --> 01:09:35,472
Before you give your last breath ...

589
01:09:37,297 --> 01:09:41,151
... curse your whole family!

590
01:09:42,663 --> 01:09:46,361
Not with this,
sealed his own fate.

591
01:09:46,569 --> 01:09:51,048
Kill him.
The prophecy was not fulfilled.

592
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:52,820
It's the end of the line.

593
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,510
Be careful, Sylathus.

594
01:10:04,125 --> 01:10:08,189
The Terhael will need it,
of what remains of it.

595
01:10:09,804 --> 01:10:11,261
Where's Jill?

596
01:10:11,266 --> 01:10:13,606
- I am also happy to see you, Maggie.
- Sarah ...

597
01:10:14,179 --> 01:10:15,950
... where is she?

598
01:10:16,054 --> 01:10:18,816
Hear me, Jacob is the
only one who can bring back.

599
01:10:18,821 --> 01:10:20,326
He saved my life last night.

600
01:10:20,379 --> 01:10:24,286
I'm not going to sit here waiting
someone who does not even know who he is.

601
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:28,610
- You really have to stay sober.
- And you have to take you away right now!

602
01:10:28,616 --> 01:10:30,642
Damn it if
I sit here waiting.

603
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:33,090
- Come on out and we find it.
- Oh yeah?

604
01:10:33,193 --> 01:10:35,799
You're going out there and you're dead!

605
01:10:44,498 --> 01:10:45,957
Where am I?

606
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,603
Come here, child.

607
01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:59,918
Look forward to you.

608
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:02,368
Tell me what your eyes see.

609
01:11:02,836 --> 01:11:05,232
- It's just the city ...
- No.

610
01:11:05,858 --> 01:11:09,869
This is not an ordinary city, child.

611
01:11:09,874 --> 01:11:13,880
You are cursed for
forever for their sins.

612
01:11:15,181 --> 01:11:16,692
Sins?

613
01:11:17,736 --> 01:11:21,797
Against me
against my wife.

614
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:24,612
And against my unborn son.

615
01:11:24,617 --> 01:11:27,268
And with such a vengeance I replied.

616
01:11:32,426 --> 01:11:34,770
You know what this is?

617
01:11:35,552 --> 01:11:37,478
It belonged to my uncle Michael.

618
01:11:38,052 --> 01:11:41,542
Stolen from me by him.

619
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,512
And so I cursed his
bloodline.

620
01:11:44,517 --> 01:11:46,335
Your blood line.

621
01:11:47,949 --> 01:11:49,304
Notes.

622
01:11:55,973 --> 01:12:00,504
While I darken
again these empty skies.

623
01:12:38,638 --> 01:12:40,983
Maggie, a body is still here.

624
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,483
Open the door, I can handle this.

625
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:49,005
It's already getting dark.

626
01:12:49,058 --> 01:12:50,203
Hurry up!

627
01:12:54,424 --> 01:12:55,779
No!

628
01:14:05,689 --> 01:14:09,284
The night ... returned.

629
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,816
It's time to reawaken the beast.

630
01:14:15,066 --> 01:14:16,630
Sylathus.

631
01:14:16,941 --> 01:14:18,816
Kills the intruder.

632
01:15:20,706 --> 01:15:22,268
I returned home.

633
01:15:47,169 --> 01:15:48,628
Nothing ...

634
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:56,285
What was it?

635
01:15:56,338 --> 01:15:58,995
Maggie ... Maggie, no!

636
01:16:43,953 --> 01:16:45,620
Emily ...

637
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:47,704
Emily, no!

638
01:16:59,269 --> 01:17:01,561
Close it! Take this!

639
01:17:18,648 --> 01:17:20,106
Michael ...

640
01:17:20,627 --> 01:17:22,295
Spell Protection.

641
01:17:23,493 --> 01:17:24,744
Get down!

642
01:18:18,974 --> 01:18:20,693
They are there.

643
01:18:21,422 --> 01:18:25,902
So how did deceived
death so easily?

644
01:18:26,163 --> 01:18:27,674
Are you dead?

645
01:18:29,498 --> 01:18:30,957
Anna!

646
01:18:50,127 --> 01:18:53,409
The last I remember,
a trembling soul eras

647
01:18:53,414 --> 01:18:55,806
that forced his last breath.

648
01:18:55,961 --> 01:18:59,556
Vieste as consideration
by a family murdered

649
01:18:59,561 --> 01:19:03,439
whose cries were silenced at night?

650
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:07,215
Vieste enjoy it.

651
01:19:14,925 --> 01:19:19,091
Preparations were made especially
for you, Spell Protection.

652
01:19:28,365 --> 01:19:30,032
How's your leg?

653
01:19:31,282 --> 01:19:33,053
I'm so cold.

654
01:19:33,366 --> 01:19:36,074
I thought I had not
lost so much blood.

655
01:19:36,387 --> 01:19:37,638
Toma.

656
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:46,285
Ready.

657
01:19:48,369 --> 01:19:49,829
Thank you.

658
01:19:55,246 --> 01:19:57,485
Do not hear anyone scream.

659
01:20:04,831 --> 01:20:06,914
They got everybody.

660
01:20:09,102 --> 01:20:12,124
I was so afraid that
something you had happened.

661
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:15,250
I never thought to worry about.

662
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:21,084
You and Jill were all he had
after your father is gone.

663
01:20:23,063 --> 01:20:25,668
I regret that
you will have felt this way.

664
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:29,628
You'll always be my girl.

665
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:38,173
Thank you for saving me.

666
01:20:41,089 --> 01:20:42,756
I love you.

667
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:45,778
I love you too, Mom.

668
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:11,200
Find peace.

669
01:21:29,433 --> 01:21:31,622
Mother, I think we'll be fine.

670
01:21:33,704 --> 01:21:35,998
Since we remain silent,
I think not ...

671
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:41,833
Mother?

672
01:21:55,689 --> 01:21:59,856
Mother, do not. Please, God,
do not let that happen.

673
01:22:03,087 --> 01:22:04,390
No!

674
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:07,983
Please mother, do not get up!

675
01:22:08,036 --> 01:22:09,703
Mother!

676
01:22:10,588 --> 01:22:12,777
No, no ... No!

677
01:23:13,518 --> 01:23:17,842
The sword does not contain Abes
more power in the circle

678
01:23:17,848 --> 01:23:20,551
than any other weapon vulgar.

679
01:23:28,313 --> 01:23:31,803
I will end your existence!

680
01:23:31,856 --> 01:23:34,460
You can not hide from me!

681
01:23:55,767 --> 01:23:58,060
Get out of the shadows.

682
01:23:58,945 --> 01:24:02,905
And witness the death of this child.

683
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:06,186
Give your last breath.

684
01:24:24,264 --> 01:24:29,369
Remember, Return Protection,
have no effect on this ...

685
01:24:29,578 --> 01:24:31,557
... circle!

686
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:32,964
No!

687
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,891
No!

688
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:43,435
Now die!

689
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:08,023
Jill?

690
01:25:09,169 --> 01:25:10,628
Are you okay?

691
01:25:37,196 --> 01:25:38,655
Anda.

692
01:25:39,488 --> 01:25:41,364
We'll take you home.

693
01:26:10,954 --> 01:26:12,517
It worked.

694
01:26:14,653 --> 01:26:18,298
- The rune has been broken.
- I fell right on top of you.

695
01:26:18,977 --> 01:26:21,425
Nobody would have survived
a fall like that.

696
01:26:23,248 --> 01:26:25,437
Why is he calling you to
"Spell of Protection"?

697
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:27,260
That's what I am.

698
01:26:46,379 --> 01:26:47,629
Mother?

699
01:27:05,341 --> 01:27:06,487
Mother?

700
01:27:07,112 --> 01:27:08,414
Mother?

701
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:10,186
Mother!

702
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:13,833
No. ..

703
01:27:29,044 --> 01:27:30,607
Sarah?

704
01:27:34,097 --> 01:27:35,816
I am very sorry ...

705
01:27:49,986 --> 01:27:53,061
It was supposed
Protection Spell beings.

706
01:27:55,247 --> 01:27:56,551
I know.

707
01:27:58,061 --> 01:27:59,936
Was it for her.

708
01:28:08,167 --> 01:28:09,679
I'm it.

709
01:28:31,714 --> 01:28:35,414
As long as you have,
can bring them back.

710
01:28:35,986 --> 01:28:37,914
Can I bring them back.

711
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:40,519
Bring them back ...

712
01:28:57,866 --> 01:28:59,846
I told you!

713
01:29:00,992 --> 01:29:05,627
You can not kill what is already dead.

714
01:29:07,243 --> 01:29:10,056
The torture you for eternity.

715
01:29:12,139 --> 01:29:16,516
Then your heart
is mourning the loss of another

716
01:29:16,724 --> 01:29:19,745
and finally you found
your purpose?

717
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,204
Yes ..

718
01:29:21,517 --> 01:29:24,383
The silence of thy cry!

719
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:42,666
