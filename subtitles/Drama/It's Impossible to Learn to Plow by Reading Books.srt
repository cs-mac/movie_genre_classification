2
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,351
Ozzie. Come on in.

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,270
Palmer. What's up?

4
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,523
You know Peck and Olson.

5
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,110
Peck, yes, hiya.
Olson, by reputation.

6
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,489
I'm Osborne Cox.

7
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,865
Yeah, hi.

8
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,451
Aren't you with...
Isn't he...

9
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,995
Yeah, that's right.
Have a seat.

10
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,374
Look, Oz, look.

11
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,668
There's no easy way to say this.

12
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,296
We're taking you off the Balkans desk.

13
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,466
What? Why?

14
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,719
In fact, we're moving you out
of SIGINT entirely.

15
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,974
Just... No discussion?
Just "You're out"?

16
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,977
Well, we're having the discussion now.

17
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,898
Look, Oz, this doesn't have
to be unpleasant.

18
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,735
Palmer, with all due respect,

19
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,364
what the fuck are you talking about?

20
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,533
And why is Olson here?

21
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,910
Ozzie, look...

22
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,162
What the fuck is this?

23
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,997
- I know it's not my work.
- Ozzie.

24
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,456
I'm a great fucking analyst.

25
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,833
Okay, Ozzie.

26
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,713
Ozzie, things have not been going well,
as you know.

27
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,090
You have a drinking problem.

28
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,016
I have a drinking problem?

29
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,643
This doesn't have to be unpleasant.

30
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,898
We found something for you in State.
It's a...

31
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,235
Well, it is a lower clearance level.
Yes.

32
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,490
But it's not...
Look, we're not terminating you.

33
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,909
Hmm.

34
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,411
This is an assault.

35
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,955
I have a drinking problem?

36
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,208
- Fuck you, Peck. You're a Mormon!
- Ozzie.

37
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,044
Next to you, we all have
a drinking problem!

38
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:37,466
What the fuck is this?
Whose ass didn't I kiss? Huh?

39
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,218
- Let's be honest!
- Okay...

40
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,346
I mean, let us be fucking honest.

41
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,850
This is a crucifixion!
This is political!

42
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,311
And don't tell me it's not!

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,648
I have a drinking problem!

44
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,454
You're home.

45
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,749
Honey, hang on to your hat.
I've got some news.

46
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,084
Did you pick up the cheeses?

47
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,335
Huh?

48
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,836
The cheeses?
Were they ready?

49
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,963
The cheeses?

50
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,298
I didn't realize you could
be home so early.

51
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,343
Yeah. I left a message for you
to stop by Arnaud's.

52
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,178
The Magruders and the Pfarrers
are coming this evening.

53
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,473
The Pfarrers...
What did Kathleen say?

54
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,267
What?

55
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,018
When you left the message?

56
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,354
That she would give you the message.

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,606
Well, I don't know,
I guess we had bigger news today.

58
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,441
My day didn't revolve around whether...

59
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,110
Do you mean that you didn't
pick up the cheeses?

60
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,611
Well, if I didn't get the message,

61
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,821
then I didn't pick up the cheeses.

62
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,572
- For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
- But, honey, hang on to your hat.

63
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,700
- What, now I have to go and pick them up?
- I have some news to...

64
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,618
Stay here and get dressed.

65
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,995
Honey, we have to talk.

66
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,249
Well, not now. I mean,
they're gonna be here in less than an hour.

67
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,627
Is that goat cheese?

68
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,422
Chèvre, yes,
that is a goat cheese.

69
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,425
'Cause I have a lactose reflux, and I can't...

70
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,135
You're lactose intolerant?

71
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,178
- Yeah, but I...
- Or you have acid reflux?

72
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,222
- They're different things.
- I know what they are.

73
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,598
So you misspoke.

74
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,475
Well, thank you for correcting me.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,853
You should try the chèvre, Harry.
It's very good.

76
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,271
Yeah. I can eat goat cheese.

77
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,523
I was just telling your husband
that I have a condition

78
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,443
where I go into
anaphylactic shock when I...

79
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,695
- Harry works in the Marshals Service, Doug.
- And my throat...

80
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,697
Oh! I'm on the legislative side.

81
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,991
I work with Senator Hobby.

82
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,035
I was with Treasury,
dealing with Homeland Security.

83
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,369
I'm with the Marshals now.

84
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,913
If you want, he'll show you
his great big gun.

85
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,043
Very funny.
Gun's no big deal.

86
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,628
Twenty years of Marshals Service,
I never discharged my weapon.

87
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,215
That sounds like something you
should be telling your psychiatrist.

88
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,760
I don't have a psychiatrist.

89
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,221
Boy, I guess my job
is pretty undramatic.

90
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,432
I'm on the legislative side.

91
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,683
Mrs. Pfarrer, what do you do?

92
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,893
Do you also carry a big gun?

93
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,562
No, I write children's...

94
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,356
She writes children's books.

95
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,901
<i>Yeah. Oliver, The Cat
Who Lives In The Rotunda.</i>

96
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,194
- Those are wonderful!
- Thank you.

97
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,445
My nieces and nephews just love them.

98
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,946
Oh! Yeah, it's a beloved, beloved series.

99
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,490
Oh! Thank you.

100
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,283
You should see the fan mail she gets.

101
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,202
Are you sure this is goat cheese?

102
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,662
Why don't you let your wife tell them
about her own books, Harry?

103
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,539
- Come with me into the kitchen.
- I'm sorry. Was I dominating?

104
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,957
Help with the crudités.

105
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,131
God damn it. He knows, doesn't he?
These are nice floors.

106
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,051
- Knows what?
- About us, he knows about us.

107
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,594
- Little prick.
- Don't be such an ass.

108
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,429
He doesn't know a thing.

109
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,100
What is that, Forbo?

110
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,316
What a horse's ass.

111
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,068
I don't know why we see them.

112
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,861
Well, she's all right.

113
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,490
She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.

114
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,456
You quit?

115
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,916
Uh-huh.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,251
Well, thank you for telling me.

117
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,585
Well, I tried to tell you this...

118
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,920
You tried? You tried?

119
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,922
And then what, aphasia kicked in?

120
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,007
No. Then our guests came and then...

121
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,885
- Why? For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
- I don't know.

122
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,971
I just got so tired.

123
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,222
You're tired?

124
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,724
Yes, of swimming against the current.

125
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,143
Uh-huh.

126
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,771
Independent thought is not valued there.

127
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,191
They resist it. They fight it.
The bureaucracy is...

128
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,236
So they gave you a pension
or severance or something?

129
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:30,073
I didn't retire. I quit.
I don't want their benefits.

130
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,492
But my benefits,
they will do you, right?

131
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,870
They'll see you through,
is that the idea?

132
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,956
It's not like that's the only way
to make money.

133
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,459
Yes? Yes?
Well, what're you gonna do?

134
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,961
I'll do some consulting.

135
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,546
Consulting.

136
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:50,719
Yes, to help out while...
I've always wanted to write.

137
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,681
Write. Write what?

138
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:00,479
I've been thinking about writing a book.

139
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,524
Or, you know, a sort of memoir.

140
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,915
You okay there, Dad?

141
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,928
Dad, I left my job at the Agency.

142
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,767
I'm sorry, Dad.

143
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:48,235
Government service is not the same
as when you were in State.

144
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,946
Things are different now.

145
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:56,243
I don't know, maybe it's
the Cold War ending.

146
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,916
Now it seems like it's all bureaucracy
and no mission.

147
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,128
I'm writing a memoir.

148
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,009
I think it can be pretty explosive.

149
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,512
But I don't think you would disapprove.

150
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,056
I don't think you would disapprove.

151
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,849
Katie's had trouble accepting it.

152
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,311
But sometimes there's
a higher patriotism, Dad.

153
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,164
I know this kind of man.
We've seen this.

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,418
Mrs. Cox, you cannot let this man

155
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,337
take advantage of you,
and he will.

156
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,463
He will.

157
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,132
Yes. This is my fear.

158
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,342
Though he's trying...
Well, he says

159
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,136
he's trying to pull
himself together but...

160
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,933
Yeah. Look, sure, I'm obliged
to tell you to try to salvage things,

161
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,853
and you should.
It's not unheard of

162
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,814
that people turn themselves around,

163
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:12,986
but you haven't broached
the possibility of divorce yet.

164
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,988
- No.
- Well, that's good.

165
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:19,284
Because first you should get his financials
before he's forewarned.

166
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,369
Because here is a man...

167
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,706
Here is a man practiced in deceit.

168
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,250
This was almost, you could say,
it's his job,

169
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,878
and there is no reason it's not improper.

170
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:35,508
There is no reason you shouldn't get
a picture of the household finances.

171
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:40,221
Paper files, computer files, whatever.
That's your prerogative.

172
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,975
You can be a spy, too, madam.

173
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,687
Do this, before he's put on alert.

174
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:52,317
Before the turtle can draw in
his head and his...

175
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,278
- Feet.
- Feet.

176
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,781
And hopefully everything will work out.

177
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,532
He will reform.

178
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,910
But if not...

179
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,955
forewarned is forearmed.

180
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:18,510
We were young and committed
and there was nothing we could not do.

181
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,931
We thought of the Agency less...

182
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,602
Um...

183
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:33,608
The principles of George Kennan,

184
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,695
a personal hero of mine,

185
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:42,117
like the fabled Murrow's Boys,

186
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:47,789
at a time of...

187
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,135
<i>You have reached the Cox Group.</i>

188
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,762
<i>We can't answer your call right...</i>

189
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,556
Hello?

190
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,391
<i>I'm looking for Dr. Cox.
Is she there?</i>

191
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:11,271
No. She isn't.
Hers is the 5719 number.

192
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,273
This is the Cox Group,

193
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,026
but you can reach her on her portable
or at her office.

194
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,696
<i>She's married!</i>

195
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,573
<i>Number four.</i>

196
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,576
<i>Has a boyfriend!</i>

197
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,910
<i>And number six.</i>

198
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,872
<i>She's pregnant!</i>

199
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,125
I should try to get a run in.

200
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:25,553
Ozzie!

201
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,588
<i>Let all with one accord rejoice</i>

202
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,925
<i>In praise of Old Nassau</i>

203
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,720
<i>In praise of Old Nassau, my boys</i>

204
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,764
<i>Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>

205
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:57,937
<i>Her sons will give
while they shall live</i>

206
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,857
<i>Three cheers for Old Nassau!</i>

207
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,823
We take all the chicken fat
off your buttocks, here.

208
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,491
Mmm-hmm.

209
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,955
- And the upper arms.
- Mmm-hmm.

210
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,500
- And a little off your tummy.
- Yeah. Great.

211
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,170
Now, we do breast augmentation...

212
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,590
with a tiny incision here...

213
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,133
That marker tickles.

214
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,593
and here.

215
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,596
And what about the upper leg,
the higher inside thigh area?

216
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,556
Well, we can do liposuction there,
as well,

217
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,558
but that area will respond to exercise.

218
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,479
The buttocks and upper arms
begin to store more fat

219
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:43,983
once you get up around 40.
The body just tells it to go there,

220
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,778
but the thighs will respond
to toning exercises.

221
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,197
Yeah, I can work on my arms
till the cows come home, but...

222
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,617
Well, also, there are of course
genetic factors.

223
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,160
The Litzkes have always been big.

224
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,286
Well, everyone's got...

225
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,747
My mother had an ass
that could pull a bus.

226
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,248
Wow! Well, that's a...

227
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,333
Father's side, too.

228
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,169
I mean, although Dad tended to carry
his weight out in front more,

229
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,879
in the gut area.
Derrière, not so much.

230
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,005
Okay.

231
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,384
And what about the face, you know,
the window to the soul?

232
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,718
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

233
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,512
Very well put.

234
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:17,266
Well, your eyes are one
of your best features,

235
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,813
but we can do something
about the incipient crow's feet.

236
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,815
Baby crow's feet.
Little chickling's feet.

237
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,650
I mean chicks.
Chickie, chickie, chickie.

238
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,027
Yes, again, well put.

239
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,029
You have a way with words.

240
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,408
We make a small incision
and then pull the skin tight,

241
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,576
like stretching the skin over a drum.

242
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,703
Not too tight, though.

243
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,871
We don't want that "worked-on" look.

244
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,416
You need sufficient slack for the face
to remain expressive.

245
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,751
Yeah, I don't wanna look
like Boris Karloff.

246
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,586
So you don't want a sex change!

247
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,422
No, I'm all woman!

248
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:52,593
So, Linda, what we're talking about here
is four different procedures.

249
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,431
The liposuction, the rhinoplasty,

250
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,309
the facial tuck, which I would
strongly recommend over the chemical peel.

251
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,936
Yeah, I don't wanna burn anything off.

252
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,397
And why should you,
with that lovely skin?

253
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,816
And lastly, the breast augmentation.

254
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:11,362
Now, we can also do something
about the vaccine scar.

255
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,283
I don't know if you wear
sleeveless dresses much...

256
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,868
Not with these ham hocks!

257
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:20,038
Yes, well, once they're nice
and svelte, post-op,

258
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,749
you may change your mind about that.

259
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,084
I wanna talk about this vaccine thing.

260
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,794
I mean, can you counsel me on this?

261
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,421
I mean, is it really that unsightly?

262
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,465
I see... I mean,
a bunch of people have them.

263
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,051
Absolutely!
Some women don't mind it.

264
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,386
It's personal taste.

265
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,061
Chad!

266
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,938
Big breath. Exhale.

267
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,357
Hold it.

268
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,400
Hold and release!

269
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,568
Chad!

270
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,862
And release.

271
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,698
Too much?

272
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,077
I just felt a straining,
a tightness in the front of my ass.

273
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,204
Well, you are pretty tight down there.

274
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,330
You have to...

275
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,623
Yes, something snapped in my ass.

276
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,666
<i>Chad Feldheimer to the office, please.</i>

277
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,293
I'm gonna check with my office.
I'll be right back,

278
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,796
and we're gonna work
on opening those hips.

279
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,427
I just got a batch from BeWithMeDC. Com.

280
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,679
Oh, no. Anything good?

281
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,431
I don't know. I'm just looking.
How do I open this?

282
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,141
Click on the...
Click on the... Yeah...

283
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,893
Okay. Oh, my God!

284
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,228
Okay. Loser.

285
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,689
Loser. Loser.

286
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,276
They should call this Mr. Loser. Com.

287
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,569
Did you have to send in a picture?

288
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,862
No, only the guys do.

289
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,364
I had to fill out a verbal profile,

290
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,990
what turns me on, what turns me off.

291
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,369
I'm really looking for a guy
with a sense of humor.

292
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,621
- That guy... Wait. That guy wasn't bad.
- Him?

293
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,456
- No, before.
- Him?

294
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,625
Yeah... He might not be a loser.

295
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,835
How can you tell?

296
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,711
- That's a Brioni suit.
- Yeah?

297
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,171
Shit, yeah.

298
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,507
Does he look like he would have
a sense of humor?

299
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,801
Looks like his optometrist
has a sense of humor.

300
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,302
What does he do?

301
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,138
State Department.

302
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,807
That's cool.

303
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,560
His hair is...
What is that?

304
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,398
Plugs?

305
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,652
This is our cardio area,
and we have a lot of machines,

306
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,237
so, believe me, there's never a wait.

307
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,489
I mean, what you see now
is like our busiest time,

308
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,241
and there's like a lot of machines open.

309
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,367
Hey, Chad.

310
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,161
Hey, Linda.
Did you call that guy?

311
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,205
No, not yet.
Chad Feldheimer, he's one of our trainers.

312
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,624
I've been doing this Internet dating thing,
and I...

313
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,917
What service?

314
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,419
BeWithMeDC. Com.

315
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,087
- Nice.
- Have you used them?

316
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,716
No. Two friends did, though,
and they both got hooked up...

317
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,551
with really special guys.

318
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,178
That's fantastic.

319
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,597
<i>If you're an English speaker,
please say, "Yes"...</i>

320
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,723
Yes!

321
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,683
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't understand what you said.</i>

322
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,768
<i>- If you're an English speaker...
- English.</i>

323
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,854
<i>Would you like to speak to the
billing department or to an agent?</i>

324
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,980
Agent.

325
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,607
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't understand what you said.</i>

326
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,109
Agent! Agent!

327
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,029
<i>Hello.
Can I help you?</i>

328
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,323
Yeah, hi.
This is Linda Litzke.

329
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,949
Shall I give you my account number?

330
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,493
<i>- You keyed it in. I have it here.
- You have it up? Okay.</i>

331
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,288
I was told that I needed
pre-approval for these surgeries...

332
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,041
<i>Yes, I'm showing that this procedure
was not approved.</i>

333
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,792
Yes, it was denied.

334
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,754
<i>This operation is an elective procedure.
It's not covered by...</i>

335
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:18,257
No, those are four different operations.
It's very complicated.

336
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,384
I'm reinventing myself.
This is a whole new look,

337
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,554
so it's not just one thing,
but they're all approved by my doctor.

338
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,640
<i>Your doctor's approval
is not the issue, ma'am.</i>

339
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,516
<i>- But this is not... Madam.
- Our guidelines specify</i>

340
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,227
<i>that elective surgeries are...</i>

341
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,896
My job involves public interface.

342
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,814
<i>- This is not...
- I'm afraid you don't understand...</i>

343
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,650
Oh! I understand.

344
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,985
Put your supervisor on, please.

345
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,987
<i>Hold the line.</i>

346
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,118
Alan?

347
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,203
Linda?

348
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,163
Yeah.

349
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,297
<i>We've been over and over
and over this.</i>

350
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,216
<i>First you say you can't commit,
and then...</i>

351
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,843
<i>Would you come down from there?</i>

352
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,992
We were married when I was in my,
what, mid-20s?

353
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,369
A kid.

354
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,163
We were kids, 20s.

355
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,666
You think it's forever.

356
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,212
You get older,
you start to feel your mortality,

357
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,589
and you say,
"There's no more time for dishonesty,

358
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:49,343
"for subterfuge."
You say, "I'm not that person."

359
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,928
The choices you make...

360
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,847
I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.

361
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,855
Frankly, I'm thinking...

362
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,862
I guess that's what
I should be thinking, too.

363
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,780
With Sandy.

364
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,866
Well, that's what you were just saying.

365
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,034
Absolutely, yes.

366
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,911
And you're right.
You should dump that bozo.

367
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,205
No question about it.
I agree.

368
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,541
So if I were divorced...

369
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:25,254
Yes, I should settle things with Sandy

370
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,339
- because of you and me.
- Mmm-hmm.

371
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,219
It's just, you know...

372
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,724
It's hard to inflict that kind of pain,
you know.

373
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:40,144
Of course, that would be easier for you.

374
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,398
Why's that?
I don't see that.

375
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,817
Well, because he's such a dope,

376
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:50,946
and Sandy is a good lady.
She's a very special lady.

377
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,240
She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.

378
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,201
That's a little...

379
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,036
You and I should get things sorted.

380
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,288
I've always told you
it's more than just frivolity.

381
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,041
That's right. That's understood.
You've been very straight.

382
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,376
And I think I've been loud and clear.

383
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,003
Absolutely.

384
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,965
Not just fun and games.

385
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,845
Absolutely.

386
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,450
<i>- Agent!
- I'm sorry.</i>

387
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,077
<i>I didn't understand what you said.</i>

388
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,370
Agent!

389
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,750
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

390
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,461
<i>Please stay on the line
for the next available agent.</i>

391
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,849
Ted, can I talk to you
about our Mickey Mouse HMO?

392
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,017
Uh-huh! Hang on.

393
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,269
This is some heavy shit.

394
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,645
Is that my date list?

395
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,105
No, fuck.

396
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,315
You know, I'm trying to reinvent myself,
and these procedures,

397
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,651
which are so incredibly not cheap...
What is that?

398
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:11,902
I can't believe this.

399
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,988
This is like intelligence shit.

400
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,114
I'm not comfortable with this.

401
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,782
- This is like...
- What is it?

402
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,284
I can't believe this shit I'm seeing.

403
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,868
- Manolo found it.
- On the floor there.

404
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,496
Yeah. Manolo found like this CD
just lying in a locker,

405
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,415
- a locker floor, ladies' locker.
- Just lying there.

406
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,375
I'm like,
"What, someone's music or what?"

407
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,377
And I come in here,
and it's these files, man.

408
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,670
I'm not comfortable with this.

409
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,841
Talking about SIGINT
and signals and shit and...

410
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,050
"Signals" means "code",
you know.

411
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,218
It was just lying there.

412
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,597
Talking here about department heads
and their names and shit.

413
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,850
And then there's these other files
that are just, like, numbers.

414
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:48,564
Arrayed. Numbers and dates
and numbers and numbers and dates.

415
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,691
And numbers and...

416
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,528
I think that's the shit, man.

417
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,032
The raw intelligence.

418
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,742
I'm not touching this.

419
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,076
I want this out of here.

420
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,037
- Just throw it out?
- No. You can't do that.

421
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,913
You should put up a note
in the ladies' locker room.

422
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,498
Put up a note?

423
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,917
"Highly classified shit found?"

424
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,920
"Signals intelligence shit?
CIA shit?"

425
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,090
"Hello! Did anybody lose their secret CIA shit?"
I don't think so.

426
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,383
I don't know, you figure it out,

427
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,843
but I'm not comfortable with this,

428
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,179
and I want this out of Hardbodies.

429
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,598
We're running a gym here. God.

430
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,144
Manolo, you didn't find this.

431
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,563
I found it on the floor there.

432
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,065
Yeah, I know, but...

433
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,274
Right there on the floor there.

434
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,109
Just lying there.

435
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,845
Harry?

436
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,055
Yeah, it's me.

437
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,495
Absolut Saketini, please.

438
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,663
Just a Tab.

439
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,373
But if I could get an advance
on my salary,

440
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,958
I could at least
get the surgery ball rolling.

441
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,502
Whoa! There's a payroll company,
you know.

442
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,421
They don't just advance people money.

443
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,339
They just don't do that.

444
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,383
I mean, sure, I could say,
"Yes, I authorize it",

445
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,010
but that's not going to mean
anything to them.

446
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,263
Then why do they have us
on this cockamamie health plan?

447
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,806
I need those surgeries, Ted.

448
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,391
You're a beautiful woman.
You don't...

449
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,977
I have gone just about as far
as I can go with this body.

450
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,229
I think it's a beautiful...

451
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,565
It's not a phony-baloney Hollywood body.

452
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,818
That's right, Ted.
I would be laughed out of Hollywood.

453
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,112
I have very limited breasts,
a ginormous ass,

454
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,530
and I've got this gut
that swings back and forth

455
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,658
in front of me like a shopping cart
with a bent wheel.

456
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,828
You know, there's a lot of guys
that like you just the way you are.

457
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,538
Yeah. Losers.

458
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,001
- I don't know. I mean, am I a loser?
- Ted.

459
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,044
You know, I wasn't always
a manager at Hardbodies.

460
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,838
Let me tell you...

461
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,343
Let me show you something.

462
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,768
Is that you?

463
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:36,106
Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest.
Congregation in Chevy Chase.

464
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,193
- That's a good job! What happened?
- Mmm-hmm.

465
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,863
It's a long story.

466
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,408
Anyway...

467
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,120
in many ways, I'm a lot happier now.

468
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,873
My point is...

469
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,833
My point is, it's a journey.

470
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,877
That's my point.
I don't want to stay where I am.

471
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,879
I want to find someone
to share my journey.

472
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,216
Well, you know, sometimes,
if you don't look in your own back yard...

473
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,968
I know. That's why I started
this Internet dating.

474
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,430
Uh-huh. But what I'm saying is maybe,
you know, you don't have to...

475
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,517
Look, Ted, I know that you can't authorize
an advance on my salary,

476
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,561
but you could put in a request,
can't you?

477
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,397
It's not going to do any good, Linda.

478
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,235
Ted, have you ever heard of the power
of positive thinking?

479
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,788
Harry?

480
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,166
It's Monica.

481
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,460
Well, hello.

482
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,929
Maybe I can get a run in.

483
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,898
<i>- Hello?
- Oh, my God.</i>

484
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,113
Oh, my God.

485
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,576
Oh, my God.

486
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,536
Oh, my God.

487
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,871
Do you know what time it is?

488
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,206
Uh-huh. So, like,
I couldn't call you

489
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,583
on your totally unsecure phone,

490
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,835
but I know who the guy is.

491
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,170
The guy?

492
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,299
The guy, the secret guy.

493
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,885
So, is he high up?

494
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,303
I don't know if he's high up.

495
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,139
Probably. I mean,
I got his name, not his rank.

496
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,974
So what's his name?

497
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,435
Osborne Cox.

498
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,104
Never heard of him.

499
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,023
Like you're so plugged into

500
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,107
the intelligence community.

501
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,191
I'm just saying as a layperson...

502
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,612
I think the quality of the intelligence
dictates how high up he is.

503
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,155
Okay. Not what we know.

504
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,656
I also...

505
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,910
Do you have any water?
I gotta hydrate.

506
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,244
I got tap water.

507
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,579
Are you kidding?

508
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,080
How do you know who he is?

509
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,582
Sources.

510
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,875
What do you mean sources?

511
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:03,295
You got like Gatorade or anything besides,
like, Maryland swamp water?

512
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,671
Do you know how far this is from my place?

513
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,214
How do you know his name?

514
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,091
I got this geek friend,
Eddie Gallegos.

515
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,427
He does computer stuff,
hooks up people's computers

516
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,804
and programs their VCRs and shit.

517
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,475
So he examines the files and pulls off
the digital watermark, which tells you

518
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,976
what computer it was created on.

519
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,478
Fucking child's play for Eddie.

520
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,646
Uh-huh.

521
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,980
And...

522
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,859
<i>I got his number, I got his number</i>

523
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:26,985
Oh, my God.

524
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,071
That was a bit more difficult.

525
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,405
Shall we give him a tinkle?

526
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,865
Oh, my God.

527
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,867
Why?

528
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,537
'Cause he's gonna wanna know
that his shit is secure.

529
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,290
He's gonna be relieved.

530
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,835
He might even be so relieved
that he gives us a reward.

531
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,046
I would be very fucking surprised
if he did not.

532
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,881
- Wow.
- Very surprised.

533
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,258
Like, you know,
the Good Samaritan tax,

534
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,762
which is not even a tax, really,
since it's voluntary.

535
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,905
<i>Hello?</i>

536
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,160
Osborne?
Osborne Cox?

537
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,870
<i>Yes.</i>

538
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,914
<i>Who is this?</i>

539
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:27,671
This...
Is this Osborne Cox?

540
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,174
<i>Who is this? What time is it?
Who are you?</i>

541
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,342
Um...

542
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,386
I'm a Good Samaritan.

543
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,348
I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour,

544
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,643
but I thought you might be worried.

545
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,770
<i>Worried?</i>

546
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,983
About the security of your shit.

547
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,116
What on earth are you talking about?

548
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,785
Who am I speaking to?

549
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,248
Your files. Your...
The documents.

550
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:08,712
I know these documents are sensitive.

551
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:13,633
But I am perfectly willing to give
back to you your sensitive shit,

552
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,220
you know, at a time of your choosing.

553
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,140
<i>What documents are you talking about?</i>

554
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,684
Osborne Cox?

555
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,728
<i>Yes!
Yes, this is...</i>

556
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,023
Hello, it's Osborne Cox.
Who the fuck are you?

557
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,108
<i>What documents are you talking about?</i>

558
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,234
<i>Who is that?</i>

559
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,611
Okay.

560
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,200
"The bureau chief in Belgrade we all call
Slovak the Butcher.

561
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,536
"He had very little rapport
with his staff and his dispatches..."

562
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,790
Rapport.
"Very little rapport

563
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,250
"with his staff", fucking moron!

564
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,668
<i>How did you get this?</i>

565
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,337
Don't blow a gasket, Osborne.

566
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,047
<i>Who the fuck are you?
Listen to me.</i>

567
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,091
We have...
It's not important where...

568
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,759
<i>You are in way over your fucking head!</i>

569
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,344
I don't know who the fuck you are,

570
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,930
but you have no idea what you're doing!

571
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,475
Oh! Why so uptight, Osborne Cox?

572
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,770
I'm just a Good Samaritan,
a traveler on the road...

573
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,021
Tell him we're gonna give it back.

574
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,773
We just thought that he would like
to maybe know,

575
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,942
and tell him about
that Good Samaritan tax thing...

576
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,693
- Who is that? Hello?
- Ozzie, what's going on?

577
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,987
You tell him he's inconveniencing us.

578
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,697
<i>Hello!
Who the fuck is this?</i>

579
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,116
<i>Ozzie, what's going on?</i>

580
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,786
You know, this is a major
inconvenience for us,

581
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,997
and we just thought a reward...

582
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,667
<i>So it's money! So it's money!</i>

583
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,085
<i>You want money?
Okay. Listen to me.</i>

584
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,628
Well, yeah, why not?

585
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,047
<i>- Am I out of line here?
- Let me...</i>

586
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,341
Listen to me, you two clowns.

587
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,677
Listen to me very, very carefully.

588
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,056
You have no idea what you're doing,
and I warn you...

589
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,850
You warn us?
You warn us? You warn us?

590
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,601
<i>Yes. Yes. I...</i>

591
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,312
<i>- Let me tell you something, Mr. Intelligence.
- Yes. Let me...</i>

592
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,981
<i>- We warn you!
- Listen!</i>

593
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,150
We will call you back
with our demands!

594
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,317
<i>Hello? Listen to me.</i>

595
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,527
Chad! Don't you...

596
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,155
<i>- No, Chad. Don't play his game!
- Let me explain</i>

597
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,906
<i>- how this will work.
- Sorry.</i>

598
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,411
Jeez.
The nerve of that guy!

599
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:11,001
I am very fucking surprised
he did not give us that reward.

600
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,670
What on earth is going on?

601
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:18,758
Some clown, or two clowns,
have gotten a hold of my memoirs.

602
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,343
Your what?

603
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,470
Stolen it, or...
I don't know how...

604
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,597
Your what?

605
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,099
My memoirs, the book that I'm writing.

606
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,770
Well, why in God's name would anyone think
that's worth anything?

607
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,527
It doesn't sound like he's gonna play ball.

608
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,154
He'll play ball!

609
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,864
We just have to show him who's boss.

610
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,574
Well, that's...

611
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,118
He sounds very senior.

612
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,786
I think this is some senior guy

613
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,538
who has screwed the pooch, big-time.

614
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,707
Yeah, that's why we got him, you know.

615
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,918
We caught him with his thing caught
in a big, fat wringer.

616
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,628
- Yeah.
- And us in the driver's seat.

617
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,795
Uh-huh!

618
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,049
This is our opportunity.
You don't get many of these.

619
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,219
You slip on the ice outside of, you know,
a fancy restaurant,

620
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,054
- or something like this happens.
- Right.

621
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,723
And right now this has happened.

622
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,475
Yup.

623
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,101
It sure has.

624
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,399
This could put a big dent
in my surgeries.

625
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,109
Uh-huh.

626
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,237
Big time.

627
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,158
Honey! Honey!

628
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,077
Huh?

629
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,580
My car is here.
I'm off, mystery man.

630
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,916
What is that thing?

631
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,668
It's top secret, baby.

632
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,419
How many cities?

633
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,756
Seattle, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Chicago.

634
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,591
Why do they always send you to Seattle?

635
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:42,717
It's not a big market.

636
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,761
I don't know.
Lots of independent bookstores.

637
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,930
Rains all the time.
What else are people gonna do?

638
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,181
I can think of a couple of things.

639
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,267
You can think of one thing.

640
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,393
Where are they putting you?

641
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,519
Christ, it better be the Peninsula,

642
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,521
the money I make for them.

643
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,564
Are you gonna be okay?

644
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,941
I'll be sad, but I'll be okay.

645
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,276
Not too sad.

646
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,694
Just the right amount.

647
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,365
I am crazy about you, baby.

648
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,139
Hey!

649
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:44,237
Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison,

650
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,407
Zoe Caldwell.
It was marvelous.

651
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,161
First time I've ever attended
the Kennedy Honors.

652
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,829
Jane Alexander is a client,

653
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,165
an old friend of Zoe's.

654
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,583
Anyway...

655
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,670
- Connie.
- Yes, sir.

656
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:04,257
<i>Would you bring in
your copy of the Cox financials?</i>

657
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:11,097
<i>Tony sang
The Best is Yet to Come.</i>

658
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,265
<i>Tony Bennett.</i>

659
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,812
I thought I had it here on a disk.

660
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,189
I don't know where the disk is.

661
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:22,525
I'm sorry, I'll have to run another
off my hard drive.

662
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,860
All right. Okay.

663
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,112
So we've drawn up the papers,

664
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:31,201
and we are prepared to execute service
on Osborne, if you so elect, Mrs. Cox.

665
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,454
But since we are at the point
of no return,

666
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,791
I always urge my clients
in this juncture

667
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:42,045
to give it one more day of reflection.

668
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,245
Harry?

669
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,331
It's Linda.

670
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,334
Well, hello.

671
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,046
I did the whole bodyguard thing for years.

672
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,007
My guy was in State,
the Secretary as a matter of fact,

673
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,343
so I did a lot of traveling.

674
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,471
"Ironside has left the building."
We called him Iron Ass.

675
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,681
Not to his face, of course.

676
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,057
Not to his ass, either!

677
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,560
He was okay.

678
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,727
Personal protection's a young man's game.

679
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,020
These are really good.
You wanna try one?

680
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,773
Yeah? Does that have shell food in it?

681
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,234
- Shell food?
- I got a sensitivity.

682
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,735
I go into anaphylactic shock.

683
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,738
My larynx swells up and it closes...
What the hell.

684
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,490
Live dangerously, huh?

685
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,951
Can't always wear a condom, right?

686
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,828
That's right! Not always!

687
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,708
Yeah. My job now is mostly administrative.

688
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,585
Not so much PP, personal protection.

689
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,711
I do still carry the gun.

690
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,004
Oh, my God.

691
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,214
No big deal.
Never discharged it

692
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,467
in 20 years of service.
Security blanket now.

693
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,218
I don't even think about it.
Of course...

694
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,095
you're not supposed
to think about it.

695
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,848
In a situation where your man is threatened,
the training kicks in.

696
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:19,809
It's muscle memory. Just like that.
It's reflexes. It's...

697
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,811
Those are outrageous.
You wanna swap?

698
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,396
No way!

699
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,231
- Go away. Go away.
- Let me touch.

700
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,483
Okay. Saki?

701
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,153
There was a hell of a lot
of political infighting

702
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,655
and petty, petty shit,
and then basically

703
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,616
the old man stepped
on Geiberger's throat.

704
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,160
This is nice.
Is this wide-plank pine?

705
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,995
Yeah. I guess so.

706
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,705
Yeah.

707
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,374
Listen, Linda,
full disclosure here.

708
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,960
Yes, I am not wearing a wedding ring,
but I am married.

709
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,086
Hmm.

710
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,590
I took the ring off about 18 months ago
when we agreed to separate,

711
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,050
we agreed to disagree.

712
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,843
That's about the only thing
we ever agreed on.

713
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,847
Well, thanks for telling me, Harry.
I really appreciate it.

714
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,642
You know, full transparency is my MO.

715
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,521
That's not gonna go off, is it?

716
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,565
Well, let's get in the other room
and find out.

717
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,995
That's great.
That's exciting.

718
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,914
Yeah. He's very,
very communicative.

719
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,333
Very accessible.
He has a sense of humor,

720
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,418
and he agrees 100% about my surgeries.

721
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,545
Well...

722
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,754
He agrees my ass could be smaller.

723
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,381
I mean, not in a mean way.

724
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,508
It comes from a place of humor.

725
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:38,263
That's good, but, Linda,
what do you really know about this guy?

726
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:40,390
I told you, he's in
the Treasury Department.

727
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,642
But, no, I mean...

728
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,853
You know, he could be one of these guys
that cruises the Internet.

729
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,522
Yeah, so am I.

730
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,401
What's wrong with this?

731
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,152
No, you cannot wear that.

732
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,445
You have to wear a suit.

733
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,739
You mean, go home and change?

734
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,324
Yeah!

735
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,619
I was gonna ride my bike.

736
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,375
Osborne Cox.

737
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,590
And you, I take it, are Mr. Black.

738
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,884
Yes, I am.

739
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,428
You have the money?

740
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,389
$50,000.

741
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,935
That's what was agreed upon,
Osborne Cox.

742
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,191
All right. Let me explain
something to you, Mr. Black.

743
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,277
You know who I am,
I know who you are.

744
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,612
Perhaps...

745
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,075
but appearances can be deceptive.

746
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,701
Yeah.

747
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:28,247
What you're engaged in is blackmail.
That is a felony.

748
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,083
That's for starters.

749
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,959
Appearances can be deceptive.

750
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,797
I am a mere Good Samaritan who...

751
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,300
Secondly, the unauthorized dissemination

752
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:43,763
of classified material
is a federal crime.

753
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,474
If you ever carried out
your proposed threat,

754
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:52,105
you would experience such
a shit storm of consequences, my friend,

755
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,483
that your empty little head
would be spinning

756
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:59,028
faster than the wheels of your
Schwinn bicycle back there.

757
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,613
You think that's a Schwinn.

758
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:04,784
Now give me the fucking floppy
or the CD

759
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,120
or whatever the fuck it is...

760
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,331
As soon as you give us the money, dickwad!

761
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:17,505
You fuck!

762
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,798
Give it to me, fuck!

763
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,593
- You fucker.
- I know who you are, fucker!

764
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,512
You're the fucker!

765
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,393
- Where's the money?
- He hit me!

766
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,145
Where's the money?

767
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,021
He didn't give it to me.

768
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:36,190
For... Get in the car.
Get in the car.

769
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,828
What are you doing? Shit!

770
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,919
Fuck it!
Fuck! Fucking lunatic!

771
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,840
You fucking morons!

772
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,008
Dick!

773
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,511
- That'll give him something to think about.
- Yeah.

774
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,721
I knew this would happen.

775
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,847
Wait. Wait!
We gotta go back!

776
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,931
My bike!

777
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,141
It's on to Plan B.

778
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,978
That's just a Kryptonite lock.
You can open those fuckers with a Bic pen!

779
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,855
Some people.

780
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,528
What is this?

781
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,696
Russian Embassy.

782
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,243
I told Mr. Krapotkin I might be stopping by.

783
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,121
Is there a men's room?

784
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,049
Madam, you are mistaken.

785
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,219
I am assistant cultural attaché.

786
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,555
The organs of state security
are not allowed to function

787
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,265
within the borders of your country.

788
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,726
Organs?

789
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,728
Yes.

790
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,567
But what if I had, say,
secrets of a highly...

791
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:05,321
Secrets that might interest
the organs of the...

792
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,241
Yes?

793
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,915
That's just a taste.

794
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,428
May I ask the source of this material?

795
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,513
No, you may not.

796
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,598
- He's very high up.
- Chad!

797
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,725
What? I'm just saying he's high up.

798
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,149
PC or Mac?

799
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,317
- PC.
- PC.

800
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,112
Could you wait, please?

801
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,405
I do have a date.

802
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,536
Hey!

803
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,794
The fish has bitten.

804
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,296
Huh?

805
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,840
Yeah, he seems cool.

806
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,927
<i>Chad.</i>

807
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,438
Could you accompany me, please?

808
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,827
There is more material?

809
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,287
There's a lot more.

810
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,414
But we want to be paid first.

811
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,043
You are not ideological?

812
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,922
I don't think so.

813
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,507
Look, I have a date, so...

814
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,512
Date.

815
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,975
Uh-oh.

816
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,021
- A line to check in, towels piling up.
- I'm sorry, Ted.

817
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,315
And Manolo running around like crazy.

818
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,150
What happened to your nose?

819
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,860
This is not acceptable at Hardbodies.

820
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,654
You two know better than that.

821
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,364
Yes, we do, Ted.
I'm really sorry.

822
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,531
This is no way...

823
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,992
It was unavoidable, Ted.
It won't happen again.

824
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,202
But you won't tell me what's going on.

825
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,578
No, we can't.

826
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,873
I know this is really terrible, Ted,

827
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,377
but I have to go.
I have a date.

828
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:31,717
You're changing, Linda.
It's very sad.

829
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:45,314
Which, to my mind, is all the more reason
to lower the boom on Ozzie.

830
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:46,941
Mmm-hmm.

831
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,735
Is that it? "Mmm-hmm"?

832
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,739
I'm wondering if it's the right time and...

833
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,241
Well, of course it's the right time.

834
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,159
Why wouldn't it be the right time?

835
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,161
- Does this threaten you?
- No.

836
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,080
You and me, we're rock solid.

837
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,500
It's just, I think that's why
we can afford to be big.

838
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,378
We can think about Ozzie
and whether we give him a chance to

839
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,671
get himself together a little bit,

840
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,880
before you hammer the hell out of him.

841
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,633
- Is that how you see me? Hammering him?
- Of course not...

842
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,051
- No, but that was your word.
- Yeah.

843
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,804
- I don't hammer.
- No, of course not. Listen...

844
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,597
I'm no friend of the guy,
you know that.

845
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:20,099
I think he's an arrogant little geek.

846
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,644
But, you know,
we have all the time in the world,

847
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,062
and he just lost his job.

848
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,023
He didn't lose it.
He quit.

849
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,317
Yeah, well, most of the people
in this town who quit, were fired.

850
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,611
I feel sorry for him...

851
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:37,033
and I think he'll be a lot easier to deal with
if he doesn't feel cornered.

852
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:44,415
Maybe. Just as long as we're talking
about Ozzie here, not you.

853
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,125
Of course we're talking about Ozzie.

854
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,754
I'll do whatever you want, baby.
I adore you.

855
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,177
- You get the check.
- Okay.

856
00:50:56,261 --> 00:51:00,639
Yeah. Yes.
Is there blood in his stool?

857
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,142
Later. I'm running home.

858
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,813
I love you, baby.

859
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,949
Ozzie?

860
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,538
God damn it, Ozzie,
what have you done to the car?

861
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,169
All right. All right.

862
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,271
Oh, my God, am I really late?

863
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,191
No, no.
It doesn't start for five minutes.

864
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,152
You haven't seen this yet, have you?

865
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,737
This one, no.
No, I have not.

866
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,822
I hear it's terrific.

867
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:58,989
Great.

868
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,785
<i>We've been over
and over and over this.</i>

869
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,746
<i>First you say you can't commit,
and then...</i>

870
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,289
<i>Would you come down from there?</i>

871
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:19,552
Pardon our dust, the ex
is in the process of moving out.

872
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,054
I told her to expedite things, but...

873
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,180
Yeah.

874
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,099
Yeah, you know,
you try to act like an adult.

875
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,517
Well, it's never easy.

876
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,726
Hmm.

877
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,980
You wanna come downstairs?
You like surprises?

878
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,440
Well, I'm always open to new experiences.

879
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,610
I gotta tell you, I saw an ad for this
in a gentleman's magazine,

880
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,614
1,200 bucks. 1,200 bucks.
I'm looking at this thing and I think,

881
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,409
"Jesus, you gotta be kidding me.
I'm a hobbyist.

882
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,412
"This thing's basically nothing
but Speed-Rail."

883
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,372
I figure I'd go down to Home Depot

884
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,708
and whip this up myself for 100 bucks.

885
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,044
What is it?

886
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,382
You sit down there,
make yourself comfortable,

887
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,303
put your feet in the stirrups and...

888
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,310
Oh, my God!

889
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,941
That's fantastic!

890
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,693
Something, isn't it?
100 bucks all in.

891
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,738
Not counting my labor
and the cost of the dildo.

892
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,531
- Those things aren't cheap.
- Uh-huh!

893
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,659
See, I lack that.
I'm not set up to mold hard rubber.

894
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:31,123
- The Russians? The Russians?
- Uh-huh.

895
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,499
Mmm-hmm.

896
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,460
The Russian Embassy, yeah.

897
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,295
Are you sure?

898
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,506
Hey, the guy was not hard to follow,
as you know.

899
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:44,762
Why the fuck would they go to the Russians?
Why the fuck?

900
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,808
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Hal.

901
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,269
Hey. No problemo.

902
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,108
Look, Ozzie, I hate to be
the paranoid old spook,

903
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,070
but those two guys seem
very interested in you.

904
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,951
You haven't gone poofy on me,
have you, Oz?

905
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,914
Can I help you?

906
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,540
I'm sorry if I was staring,

907
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,251
but your face looks familiar.

908
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,753
It's Princeton? '73?

909
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,921
Yeah.

910
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,339
I can't remember your name.

911
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,674
Osborne Cox.

912
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,050
I thought so.

913
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,177
Served and witnessed.

914
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,763
You have a real nice evening.

915
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,558
Ouch.

916
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,157
What the fuck?

917
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,834
Fuck! What the fuck?

918
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,889
Fuck! Fucking...

919
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,564
Why did you tell him
we could get more stuff?

920
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,232
Well, maybe we can.

921
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,068
That's all Manolo found.
That was everything.

922
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,321
What, are we gonna tell Manolo

923
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,656
to scoop some more secret spy shit
off the locker floor?

924
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:28,824
- Hey!
- What?

925
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,410
I don't like the snideness,
nor the negativity.

926
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,246
- I'm sorry.
- I'm just trying to work this thing.

927
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,165
If I'm gonna reinvent myself,
I need these surgeries,

928
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,374
and these surgeries cost money.

929
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,460
- And this is not just fun and games.
- I'm sorry.

930
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,337
So let's figure this thing out, okay?

931
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,505
<i>Chad, your Berry Blast is ready.</i>

932
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,257
We know who he is.

933
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,925
Right, Osborne Cox.

934
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,511
So we can find out where he lives, right?

935
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,888
I guess.

936
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,557
- You should change into a suit.
- Why?

937
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,309
So you don't stand out
in his neighborhood.

938
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,435
There are certain elemental things, Chad.

939
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,519
His neighborhood?

940
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,439
Yes. We should take out the labels
and the laundry marks.

941
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,899
Laundry marks?

942
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,400
Deniability.

943
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,280
<i>Shake it down</i>

944
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,911
<i>Shakes right</i>

945
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,386
What's the odometer say?

946
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,388
Five.

947
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,599
About five or approximately five?
I mean...

948
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,893
For fuck's sake, Harry,
it's five miles.

949
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,520
5.2.

950
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,772
Okay. I gotta do at least five.

951
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,440
Five and a deuce is okay.

952
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,484
I'm amazed you have the energy.

953
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,861
You kidding? Pull around the corner
and we'll do it in the back.

954
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,696
You're so coarse.

955
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,115
No. Back of the car,
not a rear entry situation.

956
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,618
Fuck! I'm late.

957
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:15,999
Hello?

958
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,886
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

959
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,998
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

960
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,046
What the fuck?

961
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,391
What the fuck? Nothing?

962
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,060
Oh!

963
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:04,399
Oh, my fuck.
I killed a fucking spook.

964
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:09,946
What the fuck are you doing here,
you fucker? You...

965
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,801
Olson, what's up?

966
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,691
Palmer, what's up?

967
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:51,196
Not quite certain, sir,
but it's messy.

968
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,908
Kolyma Two tells us
they have computer files

969
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:58,203
from an ex-analyst of mine, Osborne Cox.

970
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,412
Kolyma Two?

971
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,497
Our man in the Russian Embassy.

972
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,581
Hmm.

973
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,084
They were brought in to them by a woman...

974
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,335
The Russians?

975
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:10,590
Yeah. It was brought in
by a woman named Linda Litzke,

976
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,801
an associate of a guy
named Harry Pfarrer.

977
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,928
Picture's in the file,
with Pfarrer's.

978
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:16,429
- The Russians?
- Yeah.

979
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:20,392
And who's Pfarrer?

980
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:26,898
Treasury guy who has been screwing Mrs. Cox.

981
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,650
That must be how they got the files.

982
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:31,111
Or maybe Ozzie knows about them.

983
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:32,821
They all seem to be sleeping with each other.

984
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:33,989
All right. Spare me.

985
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:36,658
Yes, sir, but this Treasury guy...

986
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,621
it's become complicated.

987
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:47,877
He just shot somebody in Ozzie's house.

988
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,172
Shot your analyst?

989
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,966
No, Ozzie wasn't there.

990
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,261
Our man surveilling hears a gunshot,

991
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,138
sees the guy wrestle something

992
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:00,640
into his car. Follows him.

993
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,184
He dumps a body in the Chesapeake Bay.

994
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,478
Well, what'd he do that for?

995
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,646
Don't know, sir.

996
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,189
For Christ sake,
did anyone fish the body out?

997
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,315
Mmm-hmm.

998
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,734
And Russian? American?

999
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,485
Don't know. Scrubbed of ID.

1000
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:15,780
And this Linda...

1001
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,323
Linda Litzke.

1002
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:18,783
Yeah, she's Treasury?

1003
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,285
No.

1004
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:24,205
We're fuzzy on her.

1005
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,835
So we don't really know
what anyone is after.

1006
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,545
Not really, sir.

1007
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,466
And this analyst, ex-analyst...

1008
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,092
Cox.

1009
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,720
Yeah. What's his clearance level?

1010
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,555
Three.

1011
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,849
Okay, no biggie.

1012
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:46,895
Just, for now, just keep an eye on everyone,
see what they do.

1013
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:51,649
Yes, sir. And we'll interface
with the FBI on this dead body.

1014
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,903
No! No. God, no. We don't want those idiots
bumbling around in this.

1015
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:56,738
Burn the body.
Get rid of it.

1016
01:07:56,822 --> 01:08:00,617
And keep an eye on everyone,
see what they do.

1017
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:03,787
Report back to me when...

1018
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,374
I don't know, when it makes sense.

1019
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,171
<i>Go!</i>

1020
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:16,466
<i>And tap. Up, up and tap!</i>

1021
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,675
<i>Up, up and tap.</i>

1022
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:19,010
I'm bigger.
I'm bigger.

1023
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,720
<i>Now let's add the arms,
right here.</i>

1024
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,514
I'm bigger than ever.

1025
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,432
<i>Up, up, again.
And again.</i>

1026
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,434
I'm bigger. I'm back.
I'm better. I'm back.

1027
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,394
<i>- Than ever. I'm back.
- Let's do it again. Come on.</i>

1028
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,521
You fuckers, I'm back.

1029
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,688
<i>Up, up, down, down.</i>

1030
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:31,856
You fuckers, I'm back.

1031
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,024
<i>Up, up, down, down, up!</i>

1032
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:35,193
<i>And last time...</i>

1033
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,871
Linda. You okay?

1034
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:49,082
Yeah, I'm fine, Ted.
I'm sorry.

1035
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:50,667
You don't look fine.

1036
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:51,876
No, no, I'm...

1037
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,046
But you won't tell me what's wrong.

1038
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,674
You never let me in, Linda.

1039
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,093
I know you're trustworthy.
I just...

1040
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:02,637
I don't want to endanger other people.
I mean...

1041
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:06,057
This is the path that I've chosen.
It's not...

1042
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:09,561
You have to isolate,
you know, a firewall.

1043
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,982
Well, I don't know what to think.

1044
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,525
You both go AWOL on Friday.

1045
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,527
And today Chad doesn't even bother
to come in at all.

1046
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,612
- I know, Ted.
- I can't run a gym this way.

1047
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,489
- I know, Ted.
- I'm going to have to fire him.

1048
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:22,907
No, no, no.
Ted, just...

1049
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,367
What?

1050
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:25,910
Give me 24 hours!

1051
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,581
- To what?
- I don't know. Just give me 24 hours!

1052
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:32,417
- Linda...
- Just give me 24 hours to solve this thing.

1053
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,172
Linda, I have to tell you.

1054
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,799
A man was in here earlier,
asking about you.

1055
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,177
Are you in some kind of trouble?

1056
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,887
Is Chad running away from something?

1057
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,306
We know what we're doing, Ted.
Let me ask you this...

1058
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:48,433
did he know my name?

1059
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,393
Well, yes, he was asking about you.

1060
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:52,645
Employment history, etcetera.
Real jerk.

1061
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,938
I told him to get lost.

1062
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,273
Thank you, Ted.

1063
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:01,487
Well, we just don't give that out
at Hardbodies.

1064
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:03,281
<i>Linda, a Mr. Krapotkin on line two.</i>

1065
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,407
Oh, my God.

1066
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,370
Mr. Krapotkin?

1067
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:10,622
<i>This Linda?</i>

1068
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:11,748
Yes?

1069
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:15,543
<i>Yes, this is Ilan Krapotkin,
in the Russian Embassy, returning your call.</i>

1070
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,588
Yes, yes! Hang on.
I'm sorry, Ted. This is private.

1071
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:29,182
<i>- Mr. Krapotkin? Is this a secure line?
- Yes?</i>

1072
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,727
Mr. Krapotkin?
Is this a secure...

1073
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:33,853
<i>Are you joking?</i>

1074
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:38,900
No! I'm very worried about my associate,
you know, Chad.

1075
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:41,653
<i>- Do you have him?
- Do we have him?</i>

1076
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,906
Is he... Was he...
Well, I don't know what the term is.

1077
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,157
Did he go over?

1078
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:50,036
<i>I don't understand.
Is he not at Hardbodies?</i>

1079
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:56,209
No. Look, could I come in
and discuss this?

1080
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,213
<i>I'm very busy at the moment.</i>

1081
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:01,839
I'm coming anyway.

1082
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:20,108
You seem distracted.

1083
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,194
Do I?

1084
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,488
Very distracted.
The last few days.

1085
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:29,367
Work.

1086
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,079
You think that might be enough carrots?

1087
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,208
What?

1088
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:38,501
For the salad.

1089
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:45,883
You know, you really are a negative person.

1090
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,386
What?

1091
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,263
I've tried to ignore it,

1092
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,056
to remain upbeat.

1093
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,392
Harry, stop the foolishness.

1094
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,769
- Stop the foolishness?
- Yes, and behave.

1095
01:11:56,854 --> 01:12:00,481
You are not speaking to one
of your "shithole buddies."

1096
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:56,871
<i>Hello?</i>

1097
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:00,249
Honey, it's so good
to hear your voice.

1098
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,501
<i>Is something wrong, Harry?</i>

1099
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:07,507
No. Yeah. Can you come home?
Baby needs you.

1100
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,342
Can you please come home?

1101
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:12,970
<i>Harry, you know I can't
just leave the book tour.</i>

1102
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,014
I can show you your present.
It's finished.

1103
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:18,684
<i>Harry, I can't just leave.
There are two days left.</i>

1104
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,603
<i>There's still Seattle.</i>

1105
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:24,148
Yeah.

1106
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:25,733
<i>I love you, Harry.</i>

1107
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:30,071
Yeah. I love you, too.

1108
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:39,455
Hey! Fucker!

1109
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:48,965
Fucker!

1110
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:56,931
Fucker!

1111
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:59,267
Who do you work for?

1112
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,060
Who do you work for?

1113
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:08,359
Who are you?
Who are you?

1114
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:10,903
Who do you work for?
CIA? NSC?

1115
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,905
- Tuchman Marsh!
- What?

1116
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,365
- Tuchman Marsh.
- Tuchman Marsh?

1117
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,491
Yes.

1118
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:16,617
Your name is Tuchman Marsh?

1119
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:18,953
Tuchman Marsh Hauptman Rodino!

1120
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,746
- I work for them!
- You work for Tuchman Marsh.

1121
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,956
Yes!

1122
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:23,833
Is that a law firm?

1123
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,210
No, a rock band.
Yes, it's a law firm.

1124
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,004
Well, why are you following me?

1125
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,839
Divorce action, numb nuts!

1126
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,385
My wife hired you?

1127
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,388
No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
Tuchman Marsh hired me.

1128
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,474
I work for Tuchman Marsh.

1129
01:14:51,069 --> 01:14:52,403
Sandy.

1130
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:55,781
Jesus. Grow up, man.
It happens to everybody.

1131
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,664
"And at midnight of the third day,

1132
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:07,251
"even the sergeant at arms fell asleep.

1133
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:15,301
"And it was just then, at that very moment,
that Oliver sneezed."

1134
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:16,969
Can we just...
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1135
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,472
You have to let the folks at home
see this illustration.

1136
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:20,932
Can we just get a shot of that?

1137
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:22,517
There, there it is.

1138
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,852
It's Oliver interrupting
the filibuster with...

1139
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,980
- That's wonderful.
- It's wonderful.

1140
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,274
<i>The book is Point of Order Oliver!</i>

1141
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:33,694
And the talented author is Sandra Pfarrer.

1142
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,363
She'll stay with us for our next segment

1143
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,323
when we meet the Sultan of Salad.

1144
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:41,035
And then it's part two of our very special
interview with Dermot Mulroney.

1145
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,578
So keep it where it is.

1146
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,667
That was way out of line.
We were so unbelievably clear with them,

1147
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,168
- "It's just an Oliver segment."
- That's fine.

1148
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,253
Del and Connie are such putzes.

1149
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,337
That's fine.
Thank you, we're done.

1150
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:52,838
Well, okay, great.

1151
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:55,424
I thought that would never end.

1152
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,302
Me, too.

1153
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:03,641
Let me get this crap off my face.

1154
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:26,372
What the fuck?

1155
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,924
Yes, madam.
Can we help you?

1156
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,719
What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy
are you running, anyway?

1157
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,512
I've been waiting for 45 minutes!

1158
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,431
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
An urgent matter.

1159
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:45,433
Well, maybe this is an urgent matter,

1160
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,603
since, you know,
Chad's been missing for 48 hours.

1161
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:51,689
I do not know the whereabouts
of Mr. Chad, madam.

1162
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,526
He was gathering information for you
when he was taken.

1163
01:16:56,612 --> 01:17:00,865
We're not interested in such information.
It was dribble.

1164
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,285
Dribble?

1165
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,454
Would you like your disk back, madam?

1166
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:07,538
Dribble?

1167
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,875
I will give you dribble.
You listen to me, Mr. Krapotkin.

1168
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:12,126
I am a US citizen,

1169
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:14,378
and I will not take
this kind of treatment.

1170
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:24,472
My check was returned
for insufficient funds.

1171
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,682
No. No, no, ma'am. No.

1172
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:29,560
There're over $40,000 in that account.

1173
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,562
The account is not overdrawn.

1174
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:34,398
When?

1175
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:38,653
But how could she have access with...

1176
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,530
What about our savings...

1177
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:44,241
What about my savings account?

1178
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,660
Mmm-hmm.

1179
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:51,165
No. No, I'm sorry.
I don't know the number to my savings account,

1180
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:54,502
because believe it or not,
I don't spend my entire day

1181
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:57,838
sitting around trying to memorize
the fucking numbers

1182
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:01,217
to my fucking bank accounts! Moron!

1183
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:18,526
No way. No, no way. Whoa!
No way, Linda. No.

1184
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:19,944
Well, I can't do it, Ted.

1185
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,445
I don't know anything about computers.

1186
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,822
Linda, this whole thing is crazy.

1187
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:25,199
It was crazy the first time,
and you want to do it again?

1188
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:28,369
Break into the man's house?

1189
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:30,663
You said the Russians
didn't even want this stuff.

1190
01:18:30,747 --> 01:18:32,206
My world is bigger than that, Ted.

1191
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:33,457
There are other people.

1192
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:34,792
There are the Chinese.

1193
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:35,960
Linda, these surgeries...

1194
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:37,211
No. It's not about the surgeries, Ted!

1195
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:39,755
We can use this as leverage
to get Chad back.

1196
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:40,881
What do you mean get him back?

1197
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,550
Information is power, Ted.
Hello!

1198
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:43,718
What do you mean get him back?

1199
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:44,885
You don't know where he is?

1200
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,639
Somebody has him, Ted.
We can use this to...

1201
01:18:48,765 --> 01:18:50,891
You call the police
if you wanna get back missing people.

1202
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,435
I can't take it! I can't take it!
I can't take it!

1203
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:53,728
You know I can't do that.

1204
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,563
We're operating off the map here, Ted.

1205
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:57,565
This is higher than the police.
It is higher than them.

1206
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,734
- Linda, I...
- I need a can-do person, Ted!

1207
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,069
I hate your negativity!
I hate your reasons why not!

1208
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,655
I hate you! I hate you!

1209
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:17,293
What will it be?

1210
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:20,129
Seven and Seven.

1211
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,845
<i>- Hello?
- It's Harry.</i>

1212
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:32,016
You think a marriage is...
And then it's...

1213
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,689
But this has all been a long time coming.

1214
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:43,986
Was it? Well, yeah, right.

1215
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:46,030
I'm just depressed.

1216
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:51,368
I gotta exercise.
I haven't run in three days.

1217
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,329
Butt crunches, anything.

1218
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,415
You think maybe I could stay here
for a little while?

1219
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,083
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no.

1220
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,294
It can't always come from me.

1221
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:02,004
I'm not that strong!

1222
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,507
You are not here for me, Harry.

1223
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:08,636
I need a can-do person!
You're all defeated!

1224
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,471
Chad is the only can-do person I know,

1225
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:12,640
- and now he's gone. He's gone.
- I'm sorry, baby.

1226
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:14,558
I'll be good.
I'll be better.

1227
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,602
I just gotta exercise.

1228
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:19,355
- Do you have a pedestrian path or something?
- Who the fuck is Chad?

1229
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:20,898
He's my friend from work.

1230
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:22,483
You can help me find him.

1231
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:23,651
You know law enforcement people.

1232
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:24,819
You could make a call.

1233
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,153
- Unofficially.
- Linda, hold on.

1234
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,321
What happened?
What's his name?

1235
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:28,447
Chad Feldheimer.

1236
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:31,659
And he just disappeared.
He hasn't been at work or at home for two days!

1237
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:33,369
Okay. You know his Social Security number?

1238
01:20:33,453 --> 01:20:35,663
- No! I...
- Okay.

1239
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:36,831
Where was the last place you saw him?

1240
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,666
No, I don't know.
He just disappeared.

1241
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,501
The Jamba Juice on K Street.

1242
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,378
And now he's gone.

1243
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,296
No. Okay.
Now, okay, okay.

1244
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:47,633
We're gonna find your little buddy.
It's a piece of cake.

1245
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:48,801
Okay.

1246
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:52,429
- Piece of cake. Very easy.
- Okay.

1247
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:57,768
Open your mouth, open it. Do as the doctor says.
Come on, open your mouth.

1248
01:20:57,894 --> 01:21:00,813
Come on. Open your mouth.
Now look here, young man.

1249
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:04,275
You do as I say, or I'm gonna ask your mother
to leave the doctor's room,

1250
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,819
and you and I are gonna
sort it out between us.

1251
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:16,036
Hello?
I'm with a patient.

1252
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:20,124
And it's the same fucking patient
she's been with since yesterday?

1253
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,085
You tell Dr. Cox I have the new keys.

1254
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:42,313
Hey, there, sunshine.

1255
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,815
You seem better.

1256
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:47,109
Yeah, well, I snuck in
a little gym time this morning.

1257
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:48,777
And our exercise last night didn't hurt.

1258
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,487
Why, Harry.

1259
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:53,657
Boy, I tell you.
I'm through banging my head against the wall.

1260
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:55,284
I'm gonna start doing what's right for me.

1261
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:57,494
I believe that, also.
I think you have to do what's right for you.

1262
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:59,413
Yeah. Hell, yeah.
You know, I had a shock recently,

1263
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:02,791
and I realized that life is not infinite
and that no one is immortal.

1264
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:05,085
I think that it's very important
to maintain a positive attitude.

1265
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,545
Always up, always ebullient.

1266
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,213
Don't sweat the small stuff.

1267
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,215
- And it's all small stuff.
- And it's all small stuff.

1268
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:32,071
Just for starters.

1269
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,366
Boy.

1270
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,662
Why, this is where we first met,
you remember?

1271
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,538
Of course I do.

1272
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,709
And it's hard to know
what the important days are until you...

1273
01:22:47,837 --> 01:22:49,922
Now, I told myself that
I wasn't going to be paranoid,

1274
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:52,049
but is that guy looking at us?

1275
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:56,095
No. Uh-uh.

1276
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:58,597
Have you found out anything about Chad?

1277
01:22:58,682 --> 01:22:59,682
No, nothing yet.

1278
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:01,809
I put in a couple of calls.
It shouldn't take too long.

1279
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:02,935
Really?

1280
01:23:03,603 --> 01:23:06,480
Yeah. There are so many databases now
it's a joke.

1281
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:09,066
Back when I was in PP,
there was still an art

1282
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,693
to finding people.
But not anymore.

1283
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:14,530
Now with cell phones?
I mean, pretty soon everybody's gonna know

1284
01:23:14,614 --> 01:23:16,573
where you are at any given moment,
any given moment.

1285
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,950
Mmm-hmm.

1286
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:19,785
All right.

1287
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:22,079
When you left Jamba Juice,

1288
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:24,873
did Chad give you any idea
where he might be going?

1289
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,251
- I know where he was going.
- You do?

1290
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:32,756
Georgetown. Olive Street.
160 Olive Street.

1291
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:36,593
It's the residence of this guy,
Osborne Cox.

1292
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:46,478
Who are you?

1293
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:50,649
What?

1294
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:55,821
Who are you? You CIA? NSA?
You're military?

1295
01:23:56,781 --> 01:24:00,826
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?

1296
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,829
Who are you?

1297
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:09,209
I'm just Linda Litzke.

1298
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,560
Harry!

1299
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:15,335
For Pete's sake.

1300
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:51,205
And you are my wife's lover?

1301
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:54,833
No.

1302
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:55,959
Then what are you doing here?

1303
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,382
I know you.
You're the guy from the gym.

1304
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,552
I'm not here representing Hardbodies.

1305
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:09,139
Yes. I know very well
what you represent.

1306
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:12,351
You represent the idiocy of today.

1307
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:16,146
I don't represent that, either.

1308
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,898
Yeah.
You're the guy at the gym

1309
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:20,025
when I asked about that moronic woman.

1310
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,402
She's not a moron.

1311
01:27:22,528 --> 01:27:24,863
You're in league
with that moronic woman.

1312
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:27,324
You're part of a league of morons.

1313
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:28,909
No. No.

1314
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:31,745
Yes. You see,
you're one of the morons

1315
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:34,456
I've been fighting my whole life,

1316
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:38,627
my whole fucking life.
But guess what.

1317
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,547
Today, I win.

1318
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:53,725
Stop!

1319
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:56,687
Intruder!

1320
01:27:57,397 --> 01:28:00,983
Stop! Intruder! Stop!

1321
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,072
Wait. Wait a minute.

1322
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:12,869
Where is the Treasury guy?
Pfarrer?

1323
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:14,830
- Right now?
- Right now.

1324
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,958
He is in a detention room
at Washington Dulles.

1325
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:19,084
Why?

1326
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,795
He was trying to board
a flight to Venezuela.

1327
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:25,424
We had his name on a hot list.
CBP pulled him in.

1328
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:30,178
Don't know why he was trying
to go to Venezuela.

1329
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:31,430
You don't know.

1330
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:32,681
No, sir.

1331
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,809
We have no extradition with Venezuela.

1332
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:37,519
Oh!

1333
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:40,188
So what should we do with him?

1334
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:42,316
For fuck's sake,
put him on the next flight to Venezuela.

1335
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,234
Yes, sir. Okay.

1336
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:48,322
- Okay. So the gym manager is dead.
- Yes, sir.

1337
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:49,448
The body is...

1338
01:28:49,532 --> 01:28:50,907
That's gone, sir.

1339
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,618
Okay.

1340
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:57,956
But there was a snag.

1341
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,125
What?

1342
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:01,918
Well...

1343
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:07,424
this analyst, Cox,
was attacking the gym guy.

1344
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:09,843
It was in broad daylight,
on the street.

1345
01:29:09,927 --> 01:29:12,304
Our man did not know what to do.

1346
01:29:12,388 --> 01:29:13,597
Felt he had to step in.

1347
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:15,474
Yes?

1348
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:17,434
He...

1349
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:22,731
He shot the analyst.
He shot Cox.

1350
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:27,694
Good. Great.
Is he dead?

1351
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,863
No, sir. He's in a coma.

1352
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:33,450
They don't think he's gonna make it.
They don't think...

1353
01:29:33,534 --> 01:29:37,162
They're pretty sure that he has
no brain function.

1354
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:43,335
Okay. Okay. If he wakes up, we'll worry
about it then. Jesus, what a clusterfuck.

1355
01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:45,712
So, that's it then?

1356
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:48,757
No one else really knows anything.
Okay.

1357
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:50,050
Um...

1358
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:52,719
Well, sir, there is...

1359
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:56,640
What?

1360
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:59,351
There is the woman, the gym woman,

1361
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:00,685
Linda Litzke.

1362
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,688
Oh! Fuck, yeah.
God! Where is she?

1363
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:05,732
We picked her up.
We have her.

1364
01:30:06,442 --> 01:30:08,193
We have her?
To do what with?

1365
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:14,783
She says she'll play ball
if we pay for some,

1366
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:18,328
I know this sounds odd,
some surgeries

1367
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:21,498
that she wants, cosmetic surgery.

1368
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:24,459
She says she'll sit on everything.

1369
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:26,211
How much?

1370
01:30:26,295 --> 01:30:27,671
There were several procedures.

1371
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:28,880
- Altogether they...
- Pay it.

1372
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:31,174
Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah.

1373
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:35,804
Jesus fucking Christ!

1374
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:37,389
Yeah.

1375
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:40,767
What do we learn, Palmer?

1376
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,185
I don't know, sir.

1377
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:44,855
I don't fucking know, either.

1378
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:48,442
- I guess we learn not to do it again.
- Yes, sir.

1379
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,652
I'm fucked if I know what we did.

1380
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:52,946
Yes, sir, it's hard to say.

1381
01:30:54,532 --> 01:30:56,908
Jesus fucking Christ.
