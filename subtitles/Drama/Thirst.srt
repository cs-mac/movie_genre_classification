<b>THIRST
Subrip: Pix</b>

2
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,211
We're not ready,

3
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,114
and it's gonna be
more dangerous out there

4
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,915
because you fired Greg.

5
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,716
Because we don't have
any money to pay him, Burt.

6
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,187
-You're doing this, not me.
-The hell I am.

7
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,721
Do you not understand
what I had to do

8
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,123
to get these kids out here?

9
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:05,591
The bond I put up
for the insurance company?

10
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:06,959
You want to lose all that?

11
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,927
Rather than risk hurting
one of the kids? Yeah.

12
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,598
Why? It never
bothered you before.

13
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,699
Okay, Burt, stop.
I'm sorry. That was low.

14
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,569
But look, you're the reason
that we're in this mess.

15
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,203
I need you to remember that.

16
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,206
How long are you gonna
hold that over my head?

17
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,507
Till I can buy you out?

18
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,246
Look, we'll take Roth
as a guide. It's fine.

19
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:29,682
What? No, no. Bad idea.

20
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,850
He's the same age
as these kids.

21
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,485
-That is a bad idea.
-Stop it!

22
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,721
It's the only idea.
Listen to me.

23
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,890
You know, we've helped
a ton of kids out here.

24
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:40,959
They need us, so we'll just
bring Roth on this one trip,

25
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,827
and then I can work all this
other stuff out, all right?

26
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,497
Please. He could use a little
growing up anyway.

27
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,865
Hello?

28
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:52,170
Is it safe to come out?

29
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:55,975
Hey, yeah. Can you double-check
these bags for me?

30
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:57,275
-Everything okay?
-Great.

31
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,245
Yeah, okay, yep.
Yeah, we'll be ready.

32
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,612
Thanks, bye.

33
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:06,050
Where the hell is he? It's only
45 minutes to the cave and back.

34
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:10,189
Relax. He's a kid.
He'll be here.

35
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:11,656
You sure it's a good idea
to take...

36
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:12,757
Summer, he'll be fine.

37
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,826
There's no other option.

38
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,898
Finally.

39
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:33,177
Sorry, Claire, sorry.

40
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:35,614
I know I was gone longer
than you said, but you saw...

41
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,182
That shit's fine.
Listen to me.

42
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:40,886
We need you to be a guide
on this trip with us, okay?

43
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,154
What?

44
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:45,323
I'm the same age
as these idiots.

45
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,959
You know how they are.
They don't listen to me.

46
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:51,196
We're short-staffed.
You're coming.

47
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:52,965
-Uncle Burt, come on.
-We're in a pinch here, Roth.

48
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:55,568
It's only seven days.
Now gear up.

49
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,805
Yes, sir.

50
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,075
I really don't believe this.

51
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:43,214
So I know you don't mind
helping your uncle,

52
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:45,117
and the hike's
a piece of cake for you,

53
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,019
so what's up?

54
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:49,622
I don't know, Aunt Summer.

55
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:51,990
I'm not trying to be difficult
for you or for Burt.

56
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,892
It's just the kids
who come here,

57
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:56,094
they treat me like some outcast,
and I don't belong with them.

58
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,963
That's why they need
somebody like you,

59
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:00,966
to show them
how normal kids behave.

60
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:04,103
Besides, you don't want Burt
out there alone with Claire.

61
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,639
He might just kill her.

62
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:09,975
Look, it's just a week.
You can do this.

63
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,844
I know you can.

64
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:12,977
I love you.

65
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,014
I love you too.

66
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,316
All right, I'm gonna
head back to the house.

67
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:20,885
Be safe.

68
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:23,254
You too.

69
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,959
Showtime.

70
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:31,297
Great.

71
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,197
Step out,
ladies and gentlemen.

72
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,302
Say goodbye
to civilization

73
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,172
and hello to Second Chance.

74
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,175
-Where the hell are we?
-Hell.

75
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,309
Can we go inside?
I burn easily.

76
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,478
Well, aren't you lucky we have
a hat and sunblock for you.

77
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:21,979
Follow me, please.

78
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:24,349
Let's go, let's move.

79
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:26,250
Welcome, everybody.

80
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:27,785
I'm Dr. Claire Taylor,

81
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:29,822
owner and director
of Second Chance.

82
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,724
Behind you, Mr. Goodman,

83
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:33,357
our wilderness expert
and trail guide.

84
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,928
Behind him is Mr. Young,
assistant trail guide.

85
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:38,330
Come on, keep up.

86
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,265
All right, first things first.

87
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:41,966
We're changing into these.
Standard issue.

88
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,068
Hell, no.
Come on, Doc.

89
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:46,137
Make sure you have a pair
of pants, boots, socks.

90
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:56,749
Trapper Andrews.

91
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,219
What the hell kind of
a name is "Trapper?"

92
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,288
I suggest you
pick up your stuff,

93
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,791
or you're not going
to have any stuff.

94
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,260
Sure thing, Pops.

95
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:14,766
I also suggest that
you don't call me "Pops."

96
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,134
Sure...

97
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,168
Pops.

98
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:21,774
Burt, Burt!
Let him up, Burt.

99
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,975
A little respect, Mr. Andrews.

100
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,911
She won't always
be around here to stop me.

101
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:29,247
Hey! Hey, I know you.

102
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,149
Yeah, you're The Crusher.

103
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,518
You're The Mad Dog Crusher.

104
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,186
Who's The Mad Dog Crusher?

105
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:37,156
Just one of the greatest
cage fighters ever.

106
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:39,158
I heard he killed
some guy in the ring.

107
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,192
No one ever knew
where he went.

108
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:43,162
Get them ready, Claire.

109
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,897
-Now you know.
-Cool.

110
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:49,434
Everybody take
your stuff and meet over there.

111
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:51,035
Move.

112
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:57,543
Hey, Tom.

113
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,543
-How you doing?
-Hey, Claire.

114
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:00,278
The office has informed me

115
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,313
that I can't make
your supply drop on Wednesday

116
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,015
unless you bring
your account up to date.

117
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:08,086
you can't
give me till Monday?

118
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,022
Claire, you know
that's not my decision.

119
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:11,355
Yeah, I know.
We're just...

120
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:13,158
We're having
some cash flow issues,

121
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:16,161
but we'll be back in the black
after this group.

122
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:18,029
You know, we're doing a lot of
good with these kids out here.

123
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:19,197
Yeah, I know.

124
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,066
Please, listen,
come next Monday,

125
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,235
I promise you I will hand you
everything I owe you in cash.

126
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:24,469
All right?
You have my word.

127
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:26,971
-All right, all right.
-Thank you.

128
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:28,974
-Here's some mail.
-Great.

129
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,908
And, Claire, there's this.

130
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:33,144
Thanks. Safe flight.

131
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,968
Son of a bitch.

132
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:36,375
Excuse me.

133
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,442
I'm so sorry.

134
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,979
-I didn't know that you were...
-Can you go?

135
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,614
Can you just please leave?

136
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,418
-Yes...
-Yeah, just get out.

137
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:53,892
Good start.

138
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,295
Perv.

139
00:14:59,297 --> 00:15:01,300
This is bullshit.

140
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:03,267
Two goons came into the club
and dragged me out.

141
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:04,670
They didn't even give me
a chance to pack.

142
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:07,338
I was asleep.
They barely let me get dressed.

143
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,140
There's no way this is legal.

144
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:10,542
Okay, tell it
to your parents.

145
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,344
Where's Ramirez?

146
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:16,614
-Ramirez!
-Coming!

147
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:19,017
What is it, a crime to
take a crap around here?

148
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,952
Come on,
come on, come on.

149
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,054
All right, everybody,
listen up, okay?

150
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,957
I'm sure you want an explanation
of what you're doing here, yes?

151
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,458
This place is called
Second Chance for a reason.

152
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:28,492
This ain't Disneyland.

153
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,428
The place is harsh.

154
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:33,030
Nobody's here to save you,
any of that.

155
00:15:33,063 --> 00:15:35,433
We're here to break you down
and try to change you.

156
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,468
All right?
The rules are very simple.

157
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:40,304
You eat what we give you,
sleep where we put you,

158
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:41,706
do what we tell you.

159
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,442
This will be your toilet.

160
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,344
-Hell no.
-Hell yes.

161
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:47,645
Well, then I'm definitely
dragging that outhouse with me

162
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:49,981
'cause I'm not doing
my business in the dirt.

163
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,384
Interesting.
I heard you'd do it anywhere.

164
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,219
-Are you kidding me?
-What?

165
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:56,221
I'm not gonna take that
from a pasty faced...

166
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:58,223
Hey, hey!

167
00:15:58,255 --> 00:15:59,457
-Sit down!
-Don't touch me.

168
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,625
You have no right
to touch me.

169
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,595
If you touch her,
she can sue you.

170
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:05,330
Enough!

171
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,599
Let me make one thing
very clear.

172
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:10,501
I'm not gonna tolerate
an ounce of disrespect.

173
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,137
I'm here to try to make you
people productive human beings,

174
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:16,375
and if I have to make your life
miserable to do it, I will.

175
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,344
And you're not gonna
sue anybody, Mr. Richards.

176
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,545
Richards?
We'll just call you "Dick."

177
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:24,348
That's enough, Mr. Andrews.
That's enough.

178
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:29,787
We are gonna deal with
your issues with school,

179
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:33,725
with your parents...

180
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,428
with drugs...

181
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:41,165
and with the law.

182
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:45,103
One way or another,

183
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:48,105
this place is gonna
change your life forever.

184
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,640
This sucks.

185
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:51,509
Get used to it, pal,

186
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,044
'cause it's just
the beginning.

187
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:55,447
All right.

188
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,716
So if any of you
have anything on you,

189
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:00,418
please place it in here now
because we will find it.

190
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,386
Trust me. Burt has
a nose like a bloodhound.

191
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,188
As a reminder,
this is a wilderness camp,

192
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:07,591
so no phones, iPads, drugs.

193
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,662
Anything that we don't give you,
you should not have on you.

194
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:12,530
-All right, come on.
-Go right ahead.

195
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,200
I got a lot of things
in a lot of places.

196
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:18,336
Okay, hey, hey, hey!
Geez! Handsy much?

197
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:20,805
What else you got?

198
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:22,173
-Oregano.
-Really?

199
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,543
It's oregano.
I am a chef.

200
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,278
You got it all,
you got it all.

201
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,712
No, no, no!
Come on.

202
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:31,149
-All?
-You cannot...

203
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,451
This is no use.
Not out here.

204
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,423
Off to a very good start.

205
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:41,826
No more contact
with anybody, got it?

206
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,360
Yep.

207
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:45,364
Really?
Nothing in your pockets?

208
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:50,568
What else you got, kid?
Tough guy?

209
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,704
It's gonna be a real great
adventure here with you.

210
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:54,239
Next!

211
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,645
All right, everybody, make sure
you have all your gear.

212
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,349
Come on, gear up.

213
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:06,485
What's the shotgun for?

214
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,187
In case something
needs to be shot.

215
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,456
Hey, here.

216
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:13,525
Let me help with that.

217
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:15,693
Here you go. See?

218
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:19,498
Shut down!

219
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:22,868
What are you, the camp bitch?

220
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,336
Hey, hey!

221
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:27,171
Let's go. Move!

222
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,478
Come on, Mr. Richards.
Off you go. You all right?

223
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,248
-All right.
-Keep your eye on that one.

224
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,548
Let's go.

225
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,554
Trapper, move it.
Come on!

226
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,500
All right, so
the first camp's 15 miles out.

227
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:58,502
Fifteen?
You expect me to walk 15 miles?

228
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:00,205
Or crawl.

229
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,917
We'll be out here
for seven days.

230
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,919
You'll cook your own food,
pitch your own tent

231
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,820
and keep a journal.

232
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,544
If you're thinking of running,

233
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:42,747
there's a hundred miles
of nothing in every direction.

234
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:46,884
So if you plan on running,
you can plan on dying.

235
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,422
On to Plan B.

236
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:52,657
God.

237
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,697
-Stop looking at me.
-What?

238
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,966
I said stop looking at me.

239
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,634
Look, you're in front of me.

240
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,337
Well, pass me.

241
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,639
What are you,
some kind of weirdo?

242
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,007
You're like
giving me the creeps.

243
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,576
Just, please,
walk in front of me.

244
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:13,444
Whatever.

245
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,313
Hey.

246
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,249
Stop looking at me.

247
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,591
Hey, look!

248
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,661
That's something you don't see
in Beverly Hills.

249
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:31,495
There's a lot of 'em
out here.

250
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:40,372
Asshole.

251
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,553
I don't even want to know
what you're doing in there.

252
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,923
You feel that?

253
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:34,793
No, I don't want to feel that.

254
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,062
No. You feel that shaking?

255
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,596
What is that?

256
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,537
It's a stampede.
Stampede!

257
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:46,671
-Stampede!
-Come on!

258
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:48,740
Gotta go!

259
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:51,076
-Come on!
-It's a stampede, you idiot.

260
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:53,345
Come on!

261
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:54,846
Get out! Go! Go!

262
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:58,449
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

263
00:21:58,482 --> 00:21:59,650
Okay, go, go!

264
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:03,087
What's going on?

265
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,623
Hey, come on!

266
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:17,935
Courtney!

267
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:28,012
Come on! Come on!
Grab my hand!

268
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,163
You okay?
I think it's over.

269
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:47,430
Hey, Claire, Claire!

270
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:52,803
Come on, step down.

271
00:22:52,836 --> 00:22:55,073
Take her, Roth.

272
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:57,409
Be careful, careful,
careful, careful.

273
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,510
Hey, Burt, everybody okay?

274
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,945
Yeah, I think we're okay.

275
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:04,783
We're not okay!
We were nearly killed!

276
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,683
-Okay.
-What kind of shit was that?

277
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:08,553
Is this your idea
of breaking us down?

278
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:10,654
It was a freak thing, okay?
Everybody's fine.

279
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:13,825
We're not fine!
Look at this place!

280
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:18,562
-Look, I know you're scared.
-I'm not scared!

281
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:21,633
-I'm pissed!
-All right! Listen, okay?

282
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:24,101
We're out in the wild,
and unpredictable stuff happens.

283
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:27,038
Somebody is gonna get sued.

284
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,706
Change your pants,
Mr. Richards.

285
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,711
All right,
everybody gather their stuff.

286
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:35,079
You okay?

287
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:39,851
Let's salvage that tent there.

288
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:47,425
Thanks.

289
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,174
Sat phone's fried.

290
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,750
What was that?

291
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,971
Geez, it's hot.
Why is it so hot?

292
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,840
Where are we,
three miles south of hell?

293
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:37,575
It's the desert, moron.

294
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:39,711
Thank you, Trapper.
Your insight is amazing.

295
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:41,245
Douche.

296
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,615
Okay, no more talking.
Trapper, slow it down.

297
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:47,718
I want you to try to be aware
of everything around you, okay?

298
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:50,120
Just be in this moment.

299
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:52,123
Hot. That's what
I'm aware of right now

300
00:24:52,155 --> 00:24:53,924
Okay, what else?

301
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,761
Be aware of your surroundings,
everybody.

302
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:59,764
So why'd you leave?
Fighting. Why'd you leave?

303
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:01,199
I know you hurt
the guy, but...

304
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:03,166
I didn't hurt someone.
I killed him.

305
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,135
But you were the best, man.

306
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:09,274
More famous for killing somebody
than being the best fighter.

307
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,843
Now I just want to be
a good person.

308
00:25:28,259 --> 00:25:30,028
-Hey, Claire?
-Yeah.

309
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,628
Check this out.

310
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:33,965
Hey, Luis!
Luis, stay with the group.

311
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,568
It looks like a giant geode.

312
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,237
This is not a geode.

313
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:41,673
What would you call it?

314
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:44,308
It's probably like a top secret
government experiment,

315
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,110
a satellite, a bomb casing.

316
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:48,211
Something sketchy like that.

317
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:50,180
Really? A bomb casing?

318
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:52,317
This does not look
like a bomb casing.

319
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:54,785
How would you know?

320
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:57,355
'Cause it looks like a giant
geode. That's how I know.

321
00:25:57,387 --> 00:26:01,358
Maybe it's from outer space,
like aliens.

322
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:04,996
Who cares?
Let's just keep walking.

323
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,265
Hey, Claire!

324
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:10,201
Yeah.

325
00:26:10,233 --> 00:26:12,736
You gotta see this.

326
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:15,138
What?

327
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:18,076
I think that's Lenny's truck.

328
00:26:18,108 --> 00:26:19,310
What?

329
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,350
It's a cell phone.

330
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,720
Look. The aliens
left their cell phone.

331
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:29,987
Yeah?

332
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:43,868
Shit.

333
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:59,149
Hey, Uncle Burt.

334
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:08,626
Man. Hey, he was just at
our place the other night.

335
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:13,297
What the hell happened?

336
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:15,766
Looks like he skidded off
or something.

337
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,451
Hey, grab the sat phone.
We gotta call this in.

338
00:27:33,483 --> 00:27:35,052
It's trampled.

339
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,388
My God.

340
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,096
It's dead.

341
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,434
-We're gonna have to go back.
-What?

342
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,036
Burt, we can't go back.

343
00:27:52,068 --> 00:27:53,904
We're two days away
from base camp,

344
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,940
and we've got five scared,
really messed up kids up there.

345
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:57,307
My God.

346
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,313
Something's off here.

347
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:05,450
Uncle Burt!

348
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:07,250
-Claire!
-We can't afford to go back.

349
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,721
Look, he got drunk, and he
drove off the ravine. Let's go.

350
00:28:09,753 --> 00:28:11,221
Uncle Burt!

351
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:13,091
I don't think that's
the way it happened.

352
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,826
We don't know what happened.
Could've been a coyote

353
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,059
or a mountain lion
or something.

354
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,128
It could've been
a vampire too,

355
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:18,395
but that's not reality.

356
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:20,064
Look, we have no communication.

357
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,865
-We're understaffed.
-I understand.

358
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:23,200
We've got a dead guy
out in the middle of nowhere.

359
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:24,769
We're going back.

360
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,140
You do and
you go to jail, Burt.

361
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:36,714
What are you talking about?

362
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,087
There's a lawsuit, Burt.

363
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:45,890
You hurt that boy.

364
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:47,959
You lost control,
and you hurt him.

365
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:50,127
He lost control.
He freaked out.

366
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,828
I just tried to restrain him.

367
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:53,831
You sure?

368
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:55,432
Come on, Claire.
You saw it. Everybody saw it.

369
00:28:55,465 --> 00:29:00,303
Everybody saw a big man
teach a boy a lesson.

370
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:03,173
We go back now,
we lose everything.

371
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:08,913
What's going on in your head?

372
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,014
You know,
I'm doing this for us.

373
00:29:11,048 --> 00:29:13,250
For Summer and for Roth, okay?
Look, Lenny's gone.

374
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,119
There's nothing
we can do about that now.

375
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:16,788
We'll call it in
when we get back to base.

376
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,189
Uncle Burt! Claire!

377
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:21,091
The kids can't know
about this.

378
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,163
I'm coming!

379
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:34,806
Hey, wait up.

380
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:37,407
Hey, Claire!

381
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:39,177
-You gotta see this.
-We gotta keep moving.

382
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,045
-No, you need to look at...
-Come on.

383
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:03,433
Here, Luis, put these
rocks around the perimeter.

384
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:06,103
No, Wes, not like that.
It has to go in the fork.

385
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,038
-I want to go home.
-That makes two of us.

386
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:10,307
-Come on.
-Wes, Wes, wait.

387
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,908
Yeah, just like that.
Lift it up. Good.

388
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:13,944
There you go.

389
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,347
Wes, it has to go in the middle
of the fork there, right?

390
00:30:18,982 --> 00:30:22,986
Uncle Burt?
Hey, Uncle Burt?

391
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:25,189
-I want to go home now!
-Wes!

392
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:28,091
-I can't stand this place!
-Calm down! Wes, come here!

393
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,296
Stop. Calm down.
Breathe, breathe?

394
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,199
You want to go home to what?

395
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:38,235
Sitting on the couch,
smoking weed?

396
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,403
At least I get to do
what I want.

397
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:43,607
Right. How's that
working out for you?

398
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,409
You seem miserable.

399
00:30:45,442 --> 00:30:47,377
He just seems
like an idiot to me.

400
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:49,413
-What the hell was that?
-Hey, hey, hey!

401
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:50,881
You wanna go home because
you and your stepmom

402
00:30:50,914 --> 00:30:52,349
get along so well?

403
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,086
If everybody's lives at home
are so great,

404
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:57,288
what do you think
you're doing here?

405
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,557
Everybody's angry because their
parents don't understand them?

406
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:02,092
I've got news. A lot of parents
don't understand their kids.

407
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,494
And they don't try to burn
down their house, Trapper.

408
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:08,164
Or get arrested
for attention, Meeka.

409
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:11,102
Or blow things up
and hack into the NSA?

410
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:14,571
-It's easier.
-What's easier?

411
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:17,040
It's easier for them
to just ship us out here

412
00:31:17,074 --> 00:31:20,577
than to admit
that they're bad parents.

413
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:23,915
Hey, girls, help me put the bags
into the tent before it rains.

414
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:27,285
Hey.

415
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:31,422
Hey, I found Lenny's phone
by that thing in the trench.

416
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:34,391
Hey, Burt, can you go help the
boys with the lean-to, please?

417
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:36,192
-Did you hear what he said?
-Can you help...

418
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,696
Well, I gotta
take a dump.

419
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:41,932
-Gross!
-Thanks, Mr. TMI.

420
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:44,167
Hold on. Don't go alone.

421
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:45,303
-Go with him.
-Come on.

422
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,239
-Go with him.
-Like hell!

423
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,275
Trapper, stop.

424
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:53,210
Trapper, slow down.

425
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:56,079
I don't need help
from the camp bitch.

426
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:57,181
Come on, dude.

427
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,018
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

428
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,221
Stop. Just leave him. Stop.

429
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:12,296
Dig a hole. Geez.

430
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:14,030
This is some shit.

431
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:15,967
It's falling down because
you don't have the rope.

432
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,501
Wes, grab the rope.

433
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:23,740
-Hey, where's Trapper?
-He went to the bathroom.

434
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:26,609
What? Alone? What are you doing?
I told you to go with him.

435
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:28,712
That asshole
didn't want my company.

436
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,480
-Burt...
-Just let him go.

437
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:33,183
Stop acting like an old woman.
He's around the corner.

438
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,353
You okay?

439
00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:05,148
-Trapper.
-Geez!

440
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:07,550
Hey. Look, I don't want
you out here alone.

441
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,354
Geez, what are you
gonna do, watch? Perv!

442
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,522
Stop! Trapper, stop.

443
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:16,160
-Get away from me.
-Just dig right there. Stop!

444
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:18,362
You look at my junk,
I'm calling the cops.

445
00:33:18,394 --> 00:33:20,698
I'm not interested
in seeing your junk.

446
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,366
-Probably can't see it anyway.
-Dick.

447
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,336
You wish you had one.

448
00:33:50,193 --> 00:33:52,529
Move! Run!
Trapper, run!

449
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:56,800
Uncle Burt.

450
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,302
-Claire, give me a light.
-Are they trying to scare us?

451
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:00,505
-Claire, give me a light!
-Run!

452
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:05,576
Come on, run!
Run! Run!

453
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,214
Trapper, run!

454
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:26,396
Uncle Burt. Uncle Burt!

455
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:30,433
Trapper.

456
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,603
Trapper, where is he?

457
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,074
What the hell?
I'm bleeding.

458
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,311
I'm bleeding.

459
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:50,253
What the hell?

460
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,791
What's wrong? What's wrong?

461
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,193
-My God!
-What was it, Trapper?

462
00:34:56,226 --> 00:34:57,862
-What happened?
-Where's Burt?

463
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:10,141
Uncle Burt!

464
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:12,476
Burt, Burt, Burt, breathe.

465
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:14,878
Breathe. Come on, come on.
Look at me, look at me.

466
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:16,413
Look at me!

467
00:35:17,947 --> 00:35:20,283
I shouldn't have let him
go alone. I'm so sorry.

468
00:35:20,317 --> 00:35:21,284
Claire!

469
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:24,588
Help!

470
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:27,657
Bring the aid kit!

471
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,359
Come on, Burt.
Stay with me, please.

472
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,929
Stay with me.
Stay with me, Burt, come on!

473
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:34,565
Burt, no, no, no!

474
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:37,268
No, no, no, no!
Please, please!

475
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,635
Take off your shirt.

476
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:58,389
Now what do we...
We have to get out of here.

477
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,791
God, what was it?
What was it?

478
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:02,793
Can we go?
We need get out of here!

479
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:04,728
Stop. Stop!

480
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,797
Stop!

481
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:09,266
There's a cave
a couple of miles from here.

482
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:11,668
We stock it with supplies
in case of emergencies.

483
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,804
We'll go there tonight
to regroup.

484
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:16,773
Tomorrow we'll go back
to base camp.

485
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:20,443
Go now.

486
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:22,179
-Go!
-Come on.

487
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:28,751
Claire.

488
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:31,355
Claire, Claire,
Claire, Claire, Claire.

489
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:32,822
Burt's gone.

490
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,692
The kids need you now,
and I need you now,

491
00:36:34,724 --> 00:36:36,693
so I need you to get up.

492
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:39,629
I need you to get up.
Get up!

493
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:43,467
Go! Go, go with them!

494
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:27,343
Trapper, what happened
back there?

495
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:28,378
Trapper!

496
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:33,251
-We're all gonna die.
-We're not gonna die.

497
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:42,960
I'm sorry about your uncle.

498
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,998
We should keep moving.

499
00:38:51,594 --> 00:38:54,898
Okay, everybody, there's
food and water in these packs.

500
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,874
Pass those around.

501
00:39:11,047 --> 00:39:13,050
Hello? Anybody out there?

502
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:16,619
Copy. Lenny, do you copy?

503
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:20,790
It's the middle of the night,
Roth. Nobody's gonna answer.

504
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:23,594
-I'm still bleeding.
-You're gonna be fine.

505
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:26,596
I will not be fine.
I am bleeding.

506
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,500
Hey, it's three in the morning.

507
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:31,868
-And we're in a cave.
-In the middle of nowhere.

508
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,773
While something outside
is trying to kill us.

509
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,907
Here.

510
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:57,093
Anybody on this radio, copy.

511
00:39:57,126 --> 00:40:00,530
Lenny, it's Roth.
Do you copy?

512
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:03,065
-Is there anybody out there?
-It's no use.

513
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:04,768
I don't think this is
the experience

514
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,170
my Dad thought I was going
to have at this camp.

515
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,773
God!

516
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:11,175
What is that?

517
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,643
It's sticky.

518
00:40:12,675 --> 00:40:13,677
Gross!

519
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:18,848
It's slimy.

520
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,552
Look, it's everywhere.

521
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,220
Hey, Roth,
I got a lot of static here.

522
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:24,955
-Static?
-A lot of static.

523
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:28,125
I swear I turned
this radio off.

524
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:29,926
God. It's here.

525
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,528
It's here, Claire.
We got to get 'em out.

526
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,197
We just got here!

527
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,840
-No sudden movements.
-What the hell?

528
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,474
Very slowly, back up slowly.

529
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:46,876
Back up slowly.

530
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,846
Screw this!

531
00:40:48,878 --> 00:40:51,882
Run! Run!

532
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:08,699
Trapper!
Trapper, where the hell are you?

533
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:10,233
Come on, let's go, come on!

534
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,976
Wes!

535
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,244
Take my hand.

536
00:41:25,614 --> 00:41:27,917
Roth, no! We have to go!

537
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:29,887
-No!
-Help!

538
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,623
No! No!

539
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:54,277
-Hey, Meeka, hold on.
-Did he kill it?

540
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,213
Where are they?
Did they kill it?

541
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:59,282
-You're such a coward!
-You shut up, bitch!

542
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:01,050
Hey, hey, no, no!

543
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,152
You're crazy, you know that?

544
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,222
Did you kill it?

545
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:09,092
I don't think
we can kill it.

546
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:12,096
Where's...
Where's Dick?

547
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,334
-Where's Wes?
-Shit.

548
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,303
You left him? No.

549
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:21,038
We don't have time for this.
Everybody up. We have to move.

550
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,940
We gotta get out of here,
and we gotta move fast.

551
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:24,907
Let's go.

552
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,175
Let's go! Everybody up!

553
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:28,945
Come on!

554
00:42:28,978 --> 00:42:30,947
Go, go, go, go.

555
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:38,355
You know, you did
everything you could.

556
00:42:38,387 --> 00:42:41,123
This is not your fault.

557
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:42,726
Let's go.

558
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:44,762
Roth, come on!

559
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:52,869
Hello?

560
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,240
-Hello, is anybody out there?
-Would you give it up already?

561
00:42:58,273 --> 00:43:01,243
There's nothing and no one out
here in this hellhole but us.

562
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:04,213
It's got to be some type of
energy, like polar magnetism.

563
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:06,082
Maybe it's got
a magnetic field around it.

564
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:09,353
If it was a magnet, the metal
would be pulled towards it.

565
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:12,155
Okay, so what's
your best explanation?

566
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:15,891
Static electricity.

567
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:18,362
Static electricity.
I mean, with all that metal,

568
00:43:18,394 --> 00:43:21,097
it must be sending up a charge
and stimulating the receivers.

569
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,000
And it gives off
a radio frequency

570
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:25,101
that interferes
with the reception.

571
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,137
Well, combine those two things,
and it's kind of like

572
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,639
this perfect storm
of radio interference.

573
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,741
I'll buy that theory.

574
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:43,119
This has to be where
that creature came from.

575
00:43:43,152 --> 00:43:45,254
Wes was right.
It's an alien ship.

576
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:47,257
Why would an alien come here?

577
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:49,393
Why would anyone come here?

578
00:43:49,425 --> 00:43:50,893
Maybe it's not supposed
to be here, okay?

579
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:53,030
Maybe it just veered off course.

580
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,398
No, it seems to me
like it's here on purpose.

581
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,932
Maybe it came here
as a seed, you know,

582
00:43:55,965 --> 00:43:57,067
like the one
to make first contact.

583
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:00,002
No, this is an egg.

584
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:03,039
That's what Wes stepped on
in the cave, the egg sac.

585
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,210
It looks like our alien
could be a she.

586
00:44:08,244 --> 00:44:10,313
You guys are all crazy.

587
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:12,916
Who cares? I just want
to get the hell out of here.

588
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:17,086
We need to keep going.
The trail's this way.

589
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,155
-Really?
-Yes.

590
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:21,223
It's not like you're trying
to figure anything out.

591
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:22,793
Because I don't care!

592
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,462
What the hell?

593
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:29,932
Roth!
Wait, Roth, hold on.

594
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,071
Roth, I...

595
00:44:38,407 --> 00:44:39,942
No.

596
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:42,211
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

597
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:46,215
You found him.

598
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,484
You and Uncle Burt
found Lenny like this,

599
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:49,786
and you didn't say anything?

600
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:51,087
We didn't know anything.

601
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,322
You knew he was dead,
didn't you?

602
00:44:52,355 --> 00:44:53,789
-Yeah, but I...
-Which is why you knew

603
00:44:53,822 --> 00:44:56,792
he wouldn't be
on the radio, right?

604
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,829
You and Burt.

605
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,197
You led us
right to that thing.

606
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,067
No, Roth. We had no idea
what was out there.

607
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:05,735
We thought it was an animal.

608
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:08,838
It doesn't matter
what you thought!

609
00:45:08,871 --> 00:45:10,873
What matters is
that you saw this.

610
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:12,242
You and Burt saw this,

611
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:16,246
and you and Burt decided
to push forward, yeah?

612
00:45:16,278 --> 00:45:19,516
Yeah, and you know...

613
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:22,018
you know we should've
turned back.

614
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:28,891
I can't believe
Burt didn't go back.

615
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:35,364
Burt wanted to turn back, Roth,
and I kept going.

616
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:37,233
I was thinking about the kids.
I was...

617
00:45:37,266 --> 00:45:39,902
The kids?

618
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:41,805
Yeah.

619
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:48,178
We gotta move.

620
00:47:26,242 --> 00:47:27,845
It's clear!

621
00:47:31,146 --> 00:47:33,115
Do we have enough parts
to make it work?

622
00:47:33,148 --> 00:47:34,284
No.

623
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:36,586
Get some water.

624
00:47:45,394 --> 00:47:47,463
Yeah.

625
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:03,380
There's no service.

626
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:06,083
You gotta be kidding me.

627
00:48:08,217 --> 00:48:09,184
That'll help.

628
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:11,487
Shut up, shitbag!

629
00:48:17,226 --> 00:48:18,528
Hey, Roth?

630
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:20,297
Come with me.

631
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,592
I'm really sorry, Roth.

632
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:17,721
Hey, so what time
does he come tomorrow?

633
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:19,389
Chopper comes at 8 a.m.

634
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:21,057
All right, everybody,
get some water.

635
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,326
Go to the bathroom,
then go to the cabin.

636
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:25,228
We'll be safe until morning.

637
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,463
I just love
civilization.

638
00:49:27,496 --> 00:49:30,666
Too bad this ain't it.

639
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:35,204
You think you're hot shit,
don't you?

640
00:49:35,237 --> 00:49:37,306
Without that gun...

641
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,478
you're nothing.

642
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,447
It's a good thing
I got the gun then.

643
00:49:46,581 --> 00:49:50,286
-I can't stand him.
-Yeah.

644
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:51,788
You okay?

645
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,623
Okay?

646
00:49:53,655 --> 00:49:56,425
Not really.

647
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,794
But I feel safer around you.

648
00:49:58,827 --> 00:50:01,398
Hey!

649
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,400
Doesn't this mean something?

650
00:50:03,432 --> 00:50:04,501
-It's here.
-Roth...

651
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,102
Everybody up.

652
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:07,771
Everybody in the cabin now!
It's here!

653
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,440
Holy moly.

654
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:14,510
Where is it?

655
00:50:14,543 --> 00:50:15,811
My God.

656
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:19,248
Shit.

657
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,417
Courtney, run. Go.

658
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,255
Luis!

659
00:50:35,164 --> 00:50:37,300
-Shut it! Shut it!
-No, wait!

660
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:40,470
Get up! Move! Go, go!

661
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,681
Get the lock!
Get the lock!

662
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:57,687
Trapper, get away
from the window.

663
00:50:57,719 --> 00:50:59,621
-Get away from the window.
-Where'd he go?

664
00:50:59,655 --> 00:51:01,258
Where is he?

665
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:09,099
Where's Claire?
Where the hell is Claire?

666
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,666
Go, Meeka, go.

667
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:16,306
Damn it.

668
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:18,240
-Claire!
-Where are they?

669
00:51:18,273 --> 00:51:19,775
We don't know
if it can hear you.

670
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:22,278
You and Meeka have to be
as quiet as possible.

671
00:51:40,362 --> 00:51:42,565
It's okay, it's okay.

672
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:51,740
Okay, Courtney,
unlock the door and be ready.

673
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:53,742
-Unlock the door.
-No way, no way!

674
00:51:53,775 --> 00:51:55,744
-Trapper, let me...
-No!

675
00:51:55,777 --> 00:51:56,745
You're stupid!

676
00:51:56,778 --> 00:51:57,746
We cannot leave them out there!

677
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,882
-Why not?
-Open the door!

678
00:51:58,914 --> 00:52:00,483
No!

679
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:02,784
No, no, no, no, no.

680
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:04,354
Claire!

681
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:17,901
Open the door.
Open the door!

682
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,769
I'm gonna unlock it,
you're gonna run, okay?

683
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:22,572
Run as fast as you can.
Okay, okay?

684
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:24,708
Ready? Run, run, run!

685
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:28,144
Let them in!

686
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,548
Open the door!

687
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:34,416
Trapper, open that door!

688
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:37,653
Let me in!
Let me in!

689
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:38,822
Let her in!

690
00:52:40,856 --> 00:52:43,927
Open the door!

691
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,695
No!

692
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,673
Don't!
Push, push, push!

693
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,408
Come on!

694
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:07,550
Pull her in.
Pull her in!

695
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,954
Get something for her head!

696
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,456
Okay. You're gonna be fine.
Okay, okay.

697
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:15,458
Just breathe.
Just keep breathing.

698
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:19,461
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

699
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:23,498
-Roth.
-Yeah?

700
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:25,367
Please get them out.

701
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,735
I will, I will.

702
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:29,905
It's okay.

703
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:40,316
Cover her.

704
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:42,219
Get something
to cover her up.

705
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:03,740
She'd still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

706
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,543
She's the reason
why we're all gonna die.

707
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,813
It's all about you,
isn't it, Trapper?

708
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:13,950
Everything is always about you.

709
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:16,552
Yeah. It's about me.

710
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:18,554
It's always about me.

711
00:54:18,586 --> 00:54:22,659
Survival of the fittest, baby.

712
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,961
Go ahead.
Pull the trigger, hotshot.

713
00:54:28,063 --> 00:54:30,699
I would rather have
my head blown off

714
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:34,570
than sucked dry
by that thing out there.

715
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:36,838
Do it.

716
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:38,840
Shoot me.

717
00:54:38,873 --> 00:54:41,576
I know you want to.

718
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,914
It's what you all want,
isn't it?

719
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:46,983
Isn't it?

720
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,790
Just do it.

721
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,726
Just shoot.

722
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:06,435
What happens now?

723
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,804
We wait for the chopper.

724
00:55:07,836 --> 00:55:09,405
That thing's still out there.

725
00:55:09,438 --> 00:55:10,807
Yeah? Well, you're
free to go, okay?

726
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,476
Nothing's stopping you.

727
00:55:13,509 --> 00:55:15,978
-Luis.
-Yeah.

728
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,315
Is that thing
still out there?

729
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:21,718
Coast is clear.

730
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,953
Okay.

731
00:55:23,985 --> 00:55:26,556
Everybody get some rest.

732
00:55:26,588 --> 00:55:28,423
We'll stay in here tonight.

733
00:55:28,456 --> 00:55:30,726
In the morning,
we'll get on the chopper.

734
00:55:33,128 --> 00:55:35,464
I'll take the first guard.

735
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:11,466
How old were you?

736
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,371
When your parents died,
how old were you?

737
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:20,643
I was 12.

738
00:56:22,177 --> 00:56:24,413
It was a car accident.

739
00:56:27,048 --> 00:56:29,518
Seems like a lifetime ago.

740
00:56:31,786 --> 00:56:32,788
And then Burt?

741
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,490
Burt.

742
00:56:35,523 --> 00:56:38,894
Burt was my uncle.

743
00:56:38,927 --> 00:56:41,697
He and Summer took me in,
practically raised me.

744
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:46,668
I'm so sorry.

745
00:56:46,702 --> 00:56:48,071
Yeah.

746
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:54,110
You know, it's ironic.

747
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:59,749
Before I came here,
I wanted to kill myself.

748
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:05,520
And now...

749
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:08,590
I really don't want to die.

750
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,996
We're running for our lives.

751
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,433
Hey.

752
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:21,804
I should show you this.

753
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:25,141
It's an old shotgun.

754
00:57:25,173 --> 00:57:27,576
It's pretty easy to use.

755
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,747
No. I don't want to learn
how to use that.

756
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:36,819
I don't think
I could kill anything.

757
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:40,589
You need to learn
in case...

758
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,724
in case something
happens to me.

759
00:57:49,597 --> 00:57:51,768
Roth, hey, don't...

760
00:58:14,155 --> 00:58:16,826
-I should get some sleep.
-Yeah, right.

761
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:38,981
-Watch you go.
-It's all about technique.

762
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,086
High score. Yep.

763
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:47,923
Will you change
the music, please?

764
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:50,225
No.

765
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:53,663
-Damn, you're good at this.
-I do what I can.

766
00:58:53,695 --> 00:58:54,831
Hey!

767
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,202
You wouldn't shoot me.

768
00:59:01,235 --> 00:59:02,271
Maybe not.

769
00:59:03,972 --> 00:59:06,576
But I think I'm making
a pretty good point.

770
00:59:10,878 --> 00:59:12,248
That's the chopper.

771
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,849
But that thing
is still out there.

772
00:59:14,882 --> 00:59:18,253
Not right now. Static free.
Unlike my parents.

773
00:59:18,286 --> 00:59:20,255
Don't worry. We'll go out there
and make sure the coast is clear

774
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:22,057
while you stay here
and pee your pants.

775
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,726
-Shut up.
-All right, everybody.

776
00:59:23,759 --> 00:59:25,260
Buddy up.

777
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:31,800
Hey,
Are you sure there's no static?

778
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,202
We're good.
We're all clear.

779
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:35,871
Let's go.

780
00:59:53,054 --> 00:59:54,723
Tom.

781
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,626
-Tom.
-Where's Claire?

782
00:59:57,659 --> 01:00:00,228
-Where's Burt?
-I'll tell you on the way.

783
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:01,897
We don't have any time.
We gotta get out of here.

784
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:03,132
-Wait a minute.
-We gotta get out of here.

785
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:05,101
Just answer my question.

786
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,235
Where's Claire and Burt?

787
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:08,269
They're dead.

788
01:00:08,302 --> 01:00:10,105
What?

789
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,974
We were attacked.

790
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:13,242
Attacked by what?

791
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:15,043
I'll tell you
on the way, Tom.

792
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:17,179
Not until I know
what the hell is going on.

793
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:21,384
I told you. We were attacked.
We have to get out of here.

794
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,284
Tom, stop.
You gotta listen to me, man.

795
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:24,920
Hey, we don't have time
for this.

796
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:27,722
We gotta get off the ground
right now!

797
01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:30,292
Tom, please.

798
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,397
You gotta listen.

799
01:00:34,429 --> 01:00:36,431
Tom, no. No, no, no.

800
01:00:36,465 --> 01:00:38,034
Stop.

801
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,336
Claire?

802
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:41,903
What happened?

803
01:00:41,936 --> 01:00:44,339
Look...

804
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:47,777
we didn't kill her, okay?
We didn't kill her.

805
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:49,210
I'll explain everything
on the way,

806
01:00:49,244 --> 01:00:52,882
but right now
we gotta go, Tom.

807
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:53,916
Now!

808
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,958
All right, everybody in.

809
01:01:03,992 --> 01:01:07,363
-We gotta unload first.
-What?

810
01:01:07,396 --> 01:01:10,199
It won't fly with all of you
and the supplies.

811
01:01:10,231 --> 01:01:12,367
All right.
Everybody grab some boxes.

812
01:01:16,271 --> 01:01:18,341
I got shotgun.

813
01:01:23,978 --> 01:01:25,780
Meeka, get in.

814
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:27,082
Come on, come on, come on.

815
01:01:43,231 --> 01:01:45,266
I am so excited
to go home.

816
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,202
We need to address
this shoving problem you have.

817
01:01:47,235 --> 01:01:49,938
Shut up.
Take us home, Mr. Pilot.

818
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:50,973
Let's go home.

819
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:56,144
What's going on?

820
01:01:56,177 --> 01:01:58,313
We're heavy.

821
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:03,885
Tom, what the hell was that?

822
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:05,019
What is happening?

823
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:06,489
What's going on?

824
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,857
Guys, it's here.
It's here again!

825
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,494
Take us down, Tom.
Take us down now!

826
01:02:19,867 --> 01:02:21,903
Shoot it! Shoot it!

827
01:02:21,936 --> 01:02:23,438
Shoot it!

828
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,349
Jump! Get out of here!

829
01:02:40,155 --> 01:02:41,791
Meeka! Meeka!

830
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:42,925
Jump!

831
01:02:45,594 --> 01:02:48,331
I don't want to go!

832
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:59,175
All right, you son of a bitch.

833
01:03:33,942 --> 01:03:36,244
Do you think it's dead?

834
01:03:36,277 --> 01:03:38,280
I wouldn't count on it.

835
01:03:40,282 --> 01:03:41,517
-Where the hell's Luis?
-Luis!

836
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:44,385
I'm good! Right here.

837
01:03:44,418 --> 01:03:46,989
-God.
-Come on, come on.

838
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:49,224
-You okay?
-Yeah.

839
01:03:49,257 --> 01:03:50,559
We can't stay here.

840
01:03:52,293 --> 01:03:54,462
We can't say here.
Can you walk?

841
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,932
-Trapper, can you walk?
-Yeah.

842
01:03:56,965 --> 01:03:59,934
Okay. We're gonna go
to Summer's house.

843
01:03:59,967 --> 01:04:01,536
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

844
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,105
Let's go.

845
01:04:03,137 --> 01:04:05,106
Follow me. Come on.

846
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:11,380
Come on. Let's go.

847
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:23,325
God, come on.

848
01:04:25,527 --> 01:04:27,528
I gotta rest, man.

849
01:04:27,561 --> 01:04:29,565
My leg's killing me.

850
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:34,303
I think I broke my ankle.

851
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:37,272
Okay, you know what?

852
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:40,543
Trapper, we're all hurt, okay?
Just keep moving.

853
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:46,447
Hey, you know the thing
about broken ankles, right?

854
01:04:46,481 --> 01:04:48,183
You can't walk on 'em.

855
01:04:48,215 --> 01:04:51,286
Then it's sprained and swollen,
man. We gotta stop.

856
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,922
Stop complaining, Trapper.
Let's go.

857
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:54,489
-Shut up, bitch.
-Hey.

858
01:04:58,159 --> 01:04:59,427
Keep up.

859
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:04,032
Who died and left you God?

860
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:12,375
I said... keep up.

861
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:15,478
Or don't.

862
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:41,938
How does that feel, bitch?

863
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:59,188
You want to know who died
and made me God?

864
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:03,057
Everyone died and made me God.

865
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:06,194
Now, you want to
stay here and die?

866
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,528
I don't care.

867
01:06:07,561 --> 01:06:10,031
Nobody cares.

868
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:16,238
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

869
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:18,039
Not worth it.

870
01:07:05,152 --> 01:07:07,288
Aunt Summer.

871
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:09,791
What happened to you?

872
01:07:09,824 --> 01:07:13,161
To all of you?
Where's Burt and Claire?

873
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:19,300
Burt's dead.

874
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:24,206
We need your help.

875
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:25,007
Please.

876
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:28,610
Here you go.
I baked some cookies.

877
01:07:28,643 --> 01:07:30,345
-Have a cookie and some water.
-Cookies? No.

878
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:32,146
You need to eat.
I'll scramble up some eggs.

879
01:07:32,179 --> 01:07:33,714
No, no eggs.
You're not listening.

880
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:36,284
Please, Aunt Summer,
listen to me.

881
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:39,555
There is some...
some thing out there, okay?

882
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:41,423
I'm trying to tell you
it attacked us, okay?

883
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:43,592
-It's some kind of creature.
-It's an alien!

884
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:47,096
It's real, okay?
We're not lying. We all saw it.

885
01:07:47,128 --> 01:07:48,697
This thing...

886
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,432
it killed two kids.

887
01:07:50,465 --> 01:07:54,236
It killed Claire,
and it killed Uncle Burt.

888
01:07:54,268 --> 01:07:55,570
Now, what I'm saying
is we can't stay here.

889
01:07:55,603 --> 01:07:57,205
We have to get
whatever supplies we can,

890
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:00,242
and we have to get
someplace safe.

891
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:01,477
How did he die?

892
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:05,713
Fighting.

893
01:08:05,746 --> 01:08:08,182
That sounds about right.

894
01:08:08,215 --> 01:08:09,451
I need to call the sheriff.

895
01:08:09,483 --> 01:08:10,652
Okay, call the sheriff.
The truck.

896
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:12,320
Where are the keys
to your truck?

897
01:08:12,353 --> 01:08:14,455
They're in it.
They're in the truck.

898
01:08:14,489 --> 01:08:17,792
Water, food, whatever
we can carry. Fill this up.

899
01:08:17,826 --> 01:08:19,394
Marge, this is Summer Goodman.

900
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:22,197
There's been some attacks.
I said attacks.

901
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:24,599
At Claire Taylor's.
At Claire Taylor's place.

902
01:08:24,632 --> 01:08:26,601
I can't hear you.
I'm gonna have to call back.

903
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,770
I must have a bad line.
There's so much static.

904
01:08:28,802 --> 01:08:30,605
I can't even hear.

905
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:34,610
It's here.

906
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,612
Where's Trapper?

907
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:40,883
-Where's Trapper?
-The truck! The truck!

908
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,219
Come on, come on.

909
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:51,893
Yeah!
Now who doesn't care, bitch?

910
01:08:51,926 --> 01:08:53,728
Trapper, stop!

911
01:08:58,265 --> 01:09:00,368
Trapper!
Trapper, it's here.

912
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,570
-Get out of here!
-It's here, you idiot!

913
01:09:06,574 --> 01:09:07,609
No!

914
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,284
Roth, Roth, wake up!

915
01:09:22,957 --> 01:09:26,295
God in heaven.
We've got to help them.

916
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,462
My God.

917
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,676
Roth, come on!
You have to wake up!

918
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:41,943
Roth! Courtney!
Get out of there!

919
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:45,747
No! Help me!

920
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:47,548
Help me!

921
01:09:47,582 --> 01:09:49,952
-You got guns?
-Yeah, inside. Come on.

922
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:02,597
No, no, no!

923
01:10:32,627 --> 01:10:35,530
Courtney. Come on!

924
01:11:09,797 --> 01:11:10,831
You all right?

925
01:11:10,864 --> 01:11:12,833
Where...
Where are the others?

926
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:14,802
Trapper's dead.

927
01:11:16,337 --> 01:11:17,773
Where...

928
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:19,840
Wh-Where's Courtney?
Where's Courtney?

929
01:11:19,873 --> 01:11:21,376
She's gone.

930
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:22,911
It took her.

931
01:11:22,944 --> 01:11:24,680
It took her?

932
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:30,385
We should wait
for the sheriff.

933
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:34,588
I know, I know, but we can't
wait for the sheriff, okay?

934
01:11:34,622 --> 01:11:37,960
I mean, she could be dead
before they get here.

935
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:42,331
She could be dead already.

936
01:11:42,363 --> 01:11:44,532
All right. Here you go.

937
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:46,934
Wait, wait.
I made you some armor.

938
01:11:46,967 --> 01:11:47,935
-Armor?
-Yeah.

939
01:11:47,969 --> 01:11:49,070
To go underneath the vest.

940
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,939
I found it in the barn.

941
01:11:50,971 --> 01:11:52,106
Like that?

942
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,709
Just like that.

943
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,444
Hopefully, you don't need it.

944
01:11:55,476 --> 01:11:57,313
That's brilliant.

945
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:21,370
Now, Roth, I made you
some pipe bombs here,

946
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,505
just in case you need
to buy yourself some time

947
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:24,905
or you need
to blow something up.

948
01:12:24,939 --> 01:12:26,842
Now, they've got about
a 20-second fuse,

949
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,777
give or take a few seconds.

950
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:31,713
Just make sure you're far away
when these things go off, okay?

951
01:12:31,746 --> 01:12:34,516
-Give or take?
-Give or take.

952
01:12:34,548 --> 01:12:36,685
I knew I liked you, Luis.

953
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,123
You guys gotta be ready
for a fight.

954
01:12:41,155 --> 01:12:42,990
Whether I make it back
with Courtney or not,

955
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:44,893
that thing is gonna be back.

956
01:12:44,926 --> 01:12:46,895
We'll be ready.

957
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:55,904
Now what?

958
01:13:23,864 --> 01:13:25,099
Courtney.

959
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,582
My God.

960
01:14:13,614 --> 01:14:14,849
Courtney.

961
01:14:28,729 --> 01:14:31,765
My God.
Okay, Courtney.

962
01:14:31,798 --> 01:14:35,103
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

963
01:14:35,136 --> 01:14:39,574
If I can get this thing
off you, can you run?

964
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:49,918
Damn it. We gotta go.

965
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:59,594
You need to trust me, okay?

966
01:14:59,627 --> 01:15:01,797
You gotta trust me.

967
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:10,072
Three, two, one.

968
01:15:12,306 --> 01:15:14,141
Okay.

969
01:15:14,175 --> 01:15:15,877
Come here, come here.

970
01:15:15,909 --> 01:15:17,746
Come here, let's go.

971
01:15:22,649 --> 01:15:23,784
Courtney, come on.

972
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,801
Mama's pissed.

973
01:15:40,835 --> 01:15:41,802
Let's go, let's go.

974
01:15:47,074 --> 01:15:48,277
Go, go, go!

975
01:15:53,747 --> 01:15:55,983
Go, go!
Come on, come on, Courtney!

976
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:58,987
Come on!

977
01:16:05,993 --> 01:16:07,094
Come on!

978
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:08,189
Once we fill all these tanks,

979
01:17:08,221 --> 01:17:10,157
all you have to do
is throw that lever

980
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,393
and then run like hell.

981
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:12,361
Got it.

982
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:16,296
There they are.

983
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:18,899
-He did it.
-Thank God.

984
01:17:20,033 --> 01:17:21,869
Is this gonna work?

985
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:24,172
We're about to find out.

986
01:17:26,774 --> 01:17:29,210
Summer, come here.
Help me out with her.

987
01:17:29,243 --> 01:17:31,413
I got her. Easy, easy.

988
01:17:31,445 --> 01:17:33,213
Take her inside,
get her cleaned up, okay?

989
01:17:33,247 --> 01:17:35,750
You're okay now,
you're okay.

990
01:17:35,783 --> 01:17:38,753
-Are you ready?
-We're close.

991
01:17:38,786 --> 01:17:40,755
So what I figured is that

992
01:17:40,787 --> 01:17:43,023
if this thing has all this
static electricity in it,

993
01:17:43,056 --> 01:17:45,193
then why not send a positive
current to its negative pole...

994
01:17:45,225 --> 01:17:48,762
English, please, Luis, come on.

995
01:17:48,796 --> 01:17:50,065
We're gonna roast it.

996
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,170
Okay, so this contraption,
what is this...

997
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:56,438
Hey!

998
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:58,906
These wires are charged
with 20,000 volts,

999
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:00,908
-so when it hits...
-It fries.

1000
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:05,479
Exactly, but you gotta
throw the switch first.

1001
01:18:05,512 --> 01:18:08,783
Okay, so then
what's all the gas for?

1002
01:18:08,815 --> 01:18:10,918
That is our backup plan.

1003
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:12,820
If the shock doesn't work,

1004
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,256
then hopefully these drums
rigged as gasoline cannons will.

1005
01:18:15,288 --> 01:18:16,925
-Okay.
-There is a drawback though.

1006
01:18:16,957 --> 01:18:19,793
-What?
-You gotta be the bait.

1007
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:21,829
All you gotta do is
lure her into the wires.

1008
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:22,963
That's all.

1009
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:24,733
-Well...
-Easy.

1010
01:18:24,765 --> 01:18:27,268
And try not to get yourself
blown up or electrocuted.

1011
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:28,403
Then you're golden.

1012
01:18:29,837 --> 01:18:31,139
When you get a moment,

1013
01:18:31,171 --> 01:18:33,006
can you fill the rest
of the gas tanks for me?

1014
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:34,710
Thanks, man.

1015
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:43,951
What in God's name
could even do this?

1016
01:18:43,984 --> 01:18:46,121
I am so sorry, honey.

1017
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:50,492
You should have never, ever
had to go through this.

1018
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:54,228
She's feeding on us.

1019
01:18:54,261 --> 01:18:57,231
She's feeding on us,
and she's not gonna stop

1020
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,268
until we are all dead.

1021
01:19:20,887 --> 01:19:23,858
You're here early.

1022
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,292
Roth, it's showtime!

1023
01:19:25,326 --> 01:19:27,295
No.

1024
01:19:31,966 --> 01:19:34,068
Luis, stay still,
stay still!

1025
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,402
Hey!

1026
01:19:35,435 --> 01:19:37,271
Hey, it's me you want!

1027
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:40,942
Roth! Shoot it, Roth!

1028
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:43,011
I'm the one that killed
your alien-ass baby!

1029
01:19:47,047 --> 01:19:48,315
Hey, over here!

1030
01:19:50,484 --> 01:19:51,920
Look at me, you ugly bastard!

1031
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,155
Courtney.

1032
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:56,591
You might need that.

1033
01:19:56,623 --> 01:20:00,228
Aunt Summer, be ready
to throw the switch.

1034
01:21:19,472 --> 01:21:20,541
No.

1035
01:21:20,573 --> 01:21:22,175
Aunt Summer, no.

1036
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,677
No, no, no!
What are you doing?

1037
01:21:23,711 --> 01:21:25,546
No!

1038
01:21:25,578 --> 01:21:28,649
This is for Burt, you bitch.

1039
01:21:28,682 --> 01:21:30,051
No! No!

1040
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:03,485
Roth!

1041
01:22:31,345 --> 01:22:33,715
Suck on this.

1042
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:07,615
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1043
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,117
Yeah.

1044
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:15,089
Luis. Luis!

1045
01:23:15,122 --> 01:23:16,356
Hey, guys.

1046
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:18,292
Let's not do that again, okay?

1047
01:23:18,324 --> 01:23:20,528
We did it.
We did it.
