00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:24,475
A film by Carlo Lizzani

2
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:28,331
The Gold of Rome

3
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:13,706
Excuse me.

4
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:22,400
- Are you the president?
- Yes.

5
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:27,299
Major Kappler of the SS awaits you at
the German headquarters immediately

6
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:31,517
to issue you regulations for
Israelites residing in Rome.

7
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,670
- But.. right away?
- Yes, immediately.

8
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,532
Could you not tell me...

9
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,719
We have orders only
to accompany you.

10
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:43,200
Let's go.

11
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:45,592
Come.

12
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:49,240
President, I'll accompany you.

13
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:52,907
Thank you. Perhaps it's better
that there's two of us.

14
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:03,631
Giovanni! Giovanni!

15
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:07,130
- Be careful, don't scare Tilde.
- Dad, Dad, where are you going?

16
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,515
We'll be back soon, you'll see.

17
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,054
Is Giulia there, please?

18
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:22,532
Yes, she's here. I'll call
her right away. Giulia?

19
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:25,294
Hello?

20
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:31,613
Yes, Dad, calm down.

21
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:33,540
Yes, dear, I'm calm, but

22
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:37,292
just seeing them,
and knowing they're dealing with us.

23
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,576
Come soon, we must be
together, we must decide.

24
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,738
Yes, Dad, yes.

25
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,713
- I have to go.
- I'll come with you.

26
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:49,621
Yes, but let's not tell anyone,
it bothers me.

27
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:52,777
Keep us informed, dear.
I didn't know you were Jewish.

28
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:57,037
Now you know.

29
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:59,590
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

30
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:02,323
Well, both of you come to my place.

31
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:06,091
- Both of us at your house? - Yes.
- But your parents don't even know us.

32
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,419
No, Massimo, you're very kind...

33
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,812
My parents are good people,
they'd be happy to help you, I'm sure.

34
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:14,743
It's a heartfelt offer,
and we'll keep it in mind.

35
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:16,766
You've moved me, young man.

36
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:21,144
- Giulia.
- You too think that we're in danger?

37
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:23,679
Well, certainly, with the Germans...

38
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,772
How many members of the
Jewish community are in Rome?

39
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:33,977
Thank you.

40
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,660
There were the persecutions,
many have left.

41
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:39,597
It's difficult to say.

42
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,644
I understand, I understand Italian!

43
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,346
Are the Jews in Rome in good health?

44
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:52,942
Misery and disease is rife.
It's difficult to find or buy medicine.

45
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:54,665
It's the war.

46
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:58,424
But it's more or less the same
for the others in Rome.

47
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:05,063
Is it true that the Jews are the
most ancient citizens of Rome?

48
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:11,474
And they don't pass under
the Arch of Titus because

49
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:13,590
their vanquished ancestors
were brought there?

50
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,454
Indeed, it's so. It's a most ancient
tradition that is still handed down.

51
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,007
Hopefully the new Italian
government will soon be formed

52
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:30,104
as an ally of the Reich,
so that they'll deal with you.

53
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:36,778
<i>Today we must deal with you directly.</i>

54
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:45,697
The Führer wrote wherever there's a
plot against the Reich, there's a Jew.

55
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:54,484
From Cain to Marx, the history of the
Jew is the history of humanity's shame.

56
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:01,567
The Third Reich demands at once
from the Jewish community of Rome:

57
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:03,722
One hundred pounds of gold.

58
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,242
- What do you mean one hundred pounds?
- Fifty kilos.

59
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:11,357
Yes, fifty kilos. Fifty.
By noon in two days time.

60
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:15,602
How can we find fifty
kilos of gold in two days?

61
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:19,262
The day after tomorrow at noon.

62
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:25,215
It's one or the other!

63
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:29,012
Either the gold or the heads of
two hundred families as hostages.

64
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,070
Fifty kilos at these times?
It's absurd.

65
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:37,734
I've been a goldsmith for thirty years.
Everyone has sold their gold.

66
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,295
Calm down! Calm down! Wait!

67
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:50,484
No way! This time we want
to listen too! Let us in!

68
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:55,330
We have rights too!
We want to hear!

69
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,110
- You can't enter.
- No, no! Let me in!

70
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,258
We'll all gather in the temple and
if they enter they'll be cursed.

71
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:08,310
We must not make a pact with them.
Let's pray to the Lord. He'll protect us.

72
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,223
We can't hold them any longer.
They want to come in!

73
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,957
- Let them hear too.
- Let them in.

74
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:23,947
- Calm down! Calm down!
- Wait at the table!

75
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,361
It's only right that you know too.

76
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,436
Do you understand? They
want fifty kilos of gold.

77
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:33,214
But fifty kilos of gold would be
about 12,000 rings like this.

78
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:36,127
And our community is down
to a few thousand members.

79
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:39,773
Whoever had any wealth is long gone.
It's absurd, we can't do it.

80
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:41,957
Friends, it's hostages or gold.

81
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:45,646
It's true that we're just a few,
but we have to find the gold.

82
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:49,361
There's no alternative. I'm sure
the Germans will keep their word.

83
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:53,571
Friends, maybe we didn't
explain ourselves well.

84
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,350
If we won't hand over the gold,
we'll have to pick 200 hostages.

85
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,509
Two hundred heads of families
to hand over to the Germans.

86
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,997
Do you want to gamble with
the lives of our children?

87
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,472
If we don't want to yield to blackmail,

88
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,976
we'll have to draw up
a list of 200 hostages.

89
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,066
I... I will be the first.

90
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,010
Right, president.

91
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,070
I agree on this.

92
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:25,087
But I ask you, do we go to the Germans
or do we wait for them to come here?

93
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:29,857
I say we wait for them.
Let them come and get the hostages.

94
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,615
They'll need at least one German
for every Jew. Each takes his own.

95
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:36,751
And mine won't be
returning home, I swear!

96
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,734
When the lamb is in
the jaws of the wolf,

97
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:43,156
he can only hope that the
beast isn't too hungry.

98
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:46,922
If we give them the fifty kilos
of gold, we'll lose power.

99
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:49,016
We'll be even weaker!

100
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:53,572
The Germans will do as they please
with us. But if we say no: No!

101
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:57,638
Then it will be heard everywhere!
In Rome, in Italy.

102
00:10:57,922 --> 00:11:00,910
Everyone will know and
everyone will be on our side.

103
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,438
And the Germans will have
to take that into account.

104
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:07,102
Their days are numbered, now.
Can't you see they've already lost the war?

105
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:09,136
<i>We need gold to be able to eat.</i>

106
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:12,454
Shall we chicken out just
when the Americans are coming?

107
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,602
But they won't arrive in time for us.

108
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:17,686
The Americans, yes.
They saw them. Alberto, tell.

109
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,990
Yes, two days ago, the
raid of via Nazionale.

110
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,215
He was with me but they didn't take him.
They took me to Nettuno to dig trenches.

111
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:29,776
And some workers who helped us escape,
had seen the American paratroopers.

112
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:32,604
That same night.
They were preparing the landing.

113
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:35,270
Everyone's talking about it.
I swear to you.

114
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,133
Friends. For now the Germans
are here and so are we.

115
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:44,931
We all know about the second front.

116
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:49,088
The Americans will land.
I both believe that and I hope for it.

117
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,655
But where?
And when?

118
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,779
We've only got a day.

119
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:58,122
Oh young people, bless them,
they don't know better.

120
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:01,277
They're always surprised
about everything.

121
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:08,848
From the Romans until now, how much
gold, how many tears have we shed?

122
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:15,209
We've always had to pay.
During the reign of the Popes,

123
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:22,171
the rabbis went to the city leader's
capitol to pay tribute.

124
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,856
He took it and raised his foot like
this. As if to give him a kick.

125
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,828
It was a symbolic gesture
but it was enough.

126
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:35,215
What guarantees are the
Germans giving us?

127
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:40,638
For me, our friend Davide is right.
No way can we rely on the Germans.

128
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,173
- Exactly, professor, you're right.
- Calm down, brothers.

129
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:51,771
I'm telling you that even this
time we will pay our tribute.

130
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,489
And that's all I have.

131
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:02,491
Wait, Mr. Sermoneta. Davide!
Listen! This is a serious moment.

132
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:05,473
We all have to be in this together.
United! Together!

133
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:08,059
Davide, what now?

134
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,864
You heard them. They just
want to hand over the gold.

135
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,735
I certainly can't convince them.
I don't know what to say.

136
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,030
In my opinion, Davide, you said
exactly the right thing, you know.

137
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:23,472
Because I'm sure we'll not benefit
from this gift. I did what I could.

138
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,854
Listen! Start gathering
up all your gold at home.

139
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:29,991
We will call all those who
live outside the ghetto.

140
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:33,589
Tonight we have to warn everyone.
Everyone!

141
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:41,272
- Piperno, seven grams.
- Seven grams.

142
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:44,104
<i>- Is this how you respect the curfew?</i>
- I was just closing.

143
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:46,947
Oh, he's just closing!
Right this minute!

144
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:51,100
See how good at it these Germans are?

145
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:54,318
- How much do you have to give?
- 50 kilos. - 50 kilos!

146
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,708
And what's this?
- The Tables of the Law.

147
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:59,090
- And you wear them around your neck?
- Yes, sir.

148
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,542
50 kilos in Rome, 100 in Milan,
and we here aren't good at anything.

149
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:05,493
Because we're not organised!

150
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:09,295
With a hundred kilos of gold
we could rebuild a militia!

151
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,730
It's no use,
the Germans will be Germans.

152
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:16,670
<i>But you, all this food,
anything that's pork, is forbidden?</i>

153
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,618
- But why, if it's so good?
- Because they're Jewish! Go away.

154
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:23,381
My aunt wouldn't eat meat on
Fridays even if she was dying.

155
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:25,280
Even when it could be got hold of.

156
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,390
- But you like pork, no?
- You bet! Whenever I can!

157
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:32,778
Can you smell it?
It's good, eat some.

158
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:35,561
Come on, it's an offer from a comrade.

159
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:38,419
Come on! So you can tell us about the gold.

160
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:41,039
How much have you collected?
Go on! Eat!

161
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:44,764
<i>Leave him alone. Maybe he hasn't eaten
since morning and pork makes him sick.</i>

162
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,058
<i>Come here! Sit down and keep us company!</i>

163
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,867
Just a bite, come on! No!
This time you have to accept.

164
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:54,587
No, I don't ever eat that.
I've already eaten, I'm not hungry.

165
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:58,458
He's not hungry! Listen to that!
That malnourished face!

166
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:01,798
<i>He's shy! Come on, try it!</i>

167
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,093
Don't make me lose my patience, come on!

168
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:07,071
Chew! Tell me if it's good.
Come on!

169
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:11,078
- Did you see!
- Let's go, Simone.

170
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,069
It's late.

171
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,445
Simone.

172
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:39,105
Calm down now.

173
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,101
Calm down, come on!

174
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,508
Look, I'll take you home, OK?

175
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:00,891
Thanks, Davide. I'm going.

176
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,892
- Let's go.
- Thanks, thanks.

177
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,252
- Tomorrow you'll come, right?
- I don't know, dear.

178
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:11,766
I need to think about it.

179
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,234
Even if we won't be coming to
your house, I'll call you.

180
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:17,037
Listen, Giulia.

181
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:20,835
It's my fault, I never dared tell you.

182
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,730
Maybe I shouldn't tell you even now.

183
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:28,176
But I love you.

184
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:33,670
For a long time I wanted to tell you.

185
00:16:34,436 --> 00:16:36,736
And I've only found the courage now.

186
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:39,999
But you don't want to hear this, I'm sorry.

187
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:42,454
Why are you sorry?

188
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,378
It's so beautiful what you just said.

189
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,065
I'm almost no longer scared.

190
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:54,227
Then it's better that I stay with you.

191
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:57,253
No, you can't.

192
00:16:58,334 --> 00:17:00,435
I too don't want to leave here.

193
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,457
I love hearing your voice.

194
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:07,891
I could forget about everything, Massimo...

195
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:19,346
<i>Curfew! Go home!</i>

196
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,659
- Look, we need to split.
- Yeah, will you come then? - Yes.

197
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:30,326
Bye.

198
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,254
<i>Amalfi Simone, five grams.
Prepare the receipt.</i>

199
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:58,537
No, what are you doing?
Please, don't. Why?

200
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,066
Mr. Amalfi, you wouldn't want to
give our enemies your memories too?

201
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,361
- Just the gold is enough.
- Ah, you're right.

202
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:08,090
May I sit here? I want to follow the
collection, watch how it's going.

203
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,977
Take a seat, there's plenty of room.

204
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,430
Perhaps over there. I won't be any trouble.

205
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,436
- Here. - Your name?
- Anselmo Finzi, son of Aldo.

206
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:31,490
- Name?
- Sonnino.

207
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,716
Give me the stone, please.

208
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:38,764
It's not worth anything, but
it's the last memory of my husband.

209
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,985
Of course. Take off the stone.

210
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,918
- It's thirty grams.
- We could use it.

211
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:55,192
If we give them it, it won't be
any use to either one of us.

212
00:18:55,262 --> 00:18:56,885
They'll never make it.

213
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:27,175
It's our old silver mezuzah.
It's not worth anything

214
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:30,620
but it's a memory of being a child in
Livorno, it comes from Palestine.

215
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:33,783
But now it's pointless moaning.
Have we forgotten anything?

216
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:36,416
- No, Dad.
- Let's go then.

217
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,222
Listen, with this goatee you
look just like a rabbi.

218
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,957
And what should I do then? Cut it?

219
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:49,221
And then remember that in life
you need to keep a certain dignity.

220
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:55,488
Well, Davide, are the shoes here or not?

221
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,482
These two have to go all
the way to Tivoli on foot.

222
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:02,015
Where is all that you
took from the barracks?

223
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:05,136
What do you think we stole?
Weapons! Only weapons!

224
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,929
- We can't pay you.
- Alberto told you.

225
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,357
Take these. They're spoils of war
but better than going barefoot.

226
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:14,971
So, where are these weapons?

227
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:17,228
- You hid them?
- Of course, we need them.

228
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:19,912
We're Sicilians. Where should we go now?

229
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,634
Sicily is liberated, we're
organising ourselves here.

230
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:26,803
We have commanders, weapons, everything.
If the Germans dare, you'll see a storm.

231
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:30,940
But we don't have anything to eat, to
clothe ourselves. Tell him, Alberto.

232
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,101
Yes, I told him already, I told him.

233
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:36,078
Help me move it.
Then we'll talk about the shoes.

234
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:39,798
- What you doing? Are you nuts?
- I'll explain later, help me.

235
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,016
In fact, I won't explain anything.

236
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:56,117
You'll realise later why
I moved the cabinet.

237
00:20:57,814 --> 00:20:59,678
Is your hideout far from Tivoli?

238
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:04,723
Amerigo, would you like to take a
nice bike ride up to Tivoli this evening?

239
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:08,555
- And you?
- Well, yeah. - We could get up to there.

240
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,794
- Twenty pairs of shoes?
- Just about.

241
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,421
Perhaps we could come to a deal.
Goods for goods.

242
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:19,555
- But, by any chance, you want..
- We're worse off than you.

243
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:21,235
Didn't you get that?

244
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,386
The men are all my sons.
The women, my daughters-in-law.

245
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:29,931
And the kids, my grandchildren. This is
all of us. And this is my brother.

246
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:33,653
A hundred lira per person per day.
To eat and to sleep.

247
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:36,500
Up there the air is good,
and then there's the journey.

248
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,203
- And how much for the journey?
- 100 each.

249
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,509
- But not for the kids.
- A hundred lire each.

250
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,686
- Vincenzo, what do you say?
- There are 21 of us, Mum.

251
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:49,295
We'd need the Bank of Italy.

252
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:52,423
<i>- Perhaps the men then?
- Yes, you go.</i>

253
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:54,882
No, no! Either all or none.

254
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:58,078
- 100 is too much. Less.
- But I'm risking my skin!

255
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,799
I'll just find
someone else who'll pay.

256
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,080
Tell me, not even if we pay with gold?

257
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,363
Sure, gold is better than cash.
But the sum is still the same.

258
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:10,812
It's no use making that face.
I'd told you so. Hiding is impossible.

259
00:22:10,882 --> 00:22:13,971
The little gold we have isn't enough
to get our personal safety,

260
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,211
but it's useful if it's put in the heap.
We needn't be discouraged.

261
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:21,197
It's just noon. We still have 24 hours.
The collection isn't going badly.

262
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:24,470
Many members of the community
have some gold. We can do it.

263
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,361
I've no more gold. We need to
pawn something to bring in money.

264
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,370
The bed. I'll pawn the bed!

265
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,570
I say there's no way out.
We'll have to do as the others do.

266
00:22:34,674 --> 00:22:36,324
If only it were useful!

267
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:40,745
But then everyone must give their gold,
got it? Everyone! - Yes, Mum.

268
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:43,534
Understood? Come on then, let's go.

269
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:51,982
- Come here a minute! - But I've
only got this and I want to keep it.

270
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:55,612
You and that Davide!
Don't try and be smart.

271
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:59,967
I've got eyes for everything.
- Mom! - Remember that! And ears!

272
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,138
Believe me, I did everything
I could to alert the Red Cross

273
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:16,272
but every communication with
Geneva was interrupted.

274
00:23:22,905 --> 00:23:24,055
You see them?

275
00:23:25,197 --> 00:23:26,197
Even here.

276
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:29,756
They arrived an hour ago and
are now in command of Rome.

277
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:33,517
One moment.

278
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,056
- It's all that I can do.
- Thank you.

279
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,245
Governorate of Rome

280
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:50,529
You, where are you going?

281
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:53,547
Is anyone there?
The mayor, the governor?

282
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:55,167
No, no, there's no one.

283
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,904
General Command

284
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,325
Wehrmacht Command Zone A

285
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,164
K-Factory
Workshop Group

286
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,736
Mr. President.

287
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,190
Sermoneta.

288
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,522
- Tell me, what is it?
- I've reflected on the situation.

289
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,044
If you insist on gathering the gold,
there might be a use for it.

290
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:37,694
To hide the people.
In the countryside, with the peasants.

291
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:38,919
Or in town.

292
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:42,502
Are you not aware of the situation
in which we find ourselves?

293
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,714
I went around the city in search
of the Italian authorities

294
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:49,900
but they've all vanished. Rome is
paralysed by uncertainty and fear.

295
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,249
Public offices and streets are deserted.

296
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,106
At home the talk is all about
the landing of the Allies.

297
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:57,919
But meanwhile the Germans
have everything under control.

298
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:01,385
You're expecting a miracle.
We are the authorities.

299
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:03,866
For my part, I know what I must do.

300
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:06,993
You have faith in the
Germans but not in us.

301
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:10,196
We are men, no? We can organise
ourselves, defend ourselves.

302
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,977
We have over 5000 years
worth of history behind us.

303
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:16,629
And we've had to endure
too many persecutions.

304
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:19,020
For more than 5,000 years we've fought,

305
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,090
and remained ourselves.
Is this not strength?

306
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:25,390
But they have the power
of the machine guns.

307
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:28,729
And I tell you one thing:
your prudence is madness!

308
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,743
- What are you doing here?
- Davide, listen, I'm doing it for you.

309
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:42,985
For you men. Everyone's giving
their gold, don't you see?

310
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:46,665
Come here, let me see.
What have you brought?

311
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,859
A watch, Davide.
It's all we had.

312
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,700
Even you don't understand.

313
00:25:57,112 --> 00:25:59,526
But come on, I'm your son.

314
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:02,515
- Don't you recognise me? Davide.
- Yes.

315
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,691
And don't you think that I might
be right at times? Answer me!

316
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,145
But I don't know anything. Don't ask me
questions. I'm doing what the others do.

317
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:15,619
It's fear that stops you thinking.
You're like the others.

318
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:18,998
At home, I'm in charge.

319
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,390
This may well be of some use to me.

320
00:26:25,989 --> 00:26:27,146
Davide!

321
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:31,915
I never had to use this, fortunately.

322
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:39,450
- Is there any bullets?
- What can you give me?

323
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:46,131
- Excuse me, but we always
keep them closed. - Don't worry.

324
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:50,218
- Dad, sit down, you'll be tired.
- But, are you staying?

325
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,989
- Shall I help with that?
- No, thanks. So, what do you think?

326
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,193
I waited all morning
by the phone.

327
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:59,714
It's not much but we'll try to settle it
as best we can. It's the only room.

328
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,440
- Now I'll call my mother.
- Thank her!

329
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:08,351
- And so? - The Jews are being persecuted.
You don't get that, do you?

330
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:11,454
And the girl is also my university mate.

331
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:16,656
She can't sit the exams because she's a Jew,
but she's smarter than many others.

332
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:19,179
Is she the one who always calls you?

333
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:22,549
Lots of people call me.
It's not forbidden, I hope.

334
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:28,209
And then...
I'm in love with her.

335
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:35,207
It's true, I'm serious.
She's the smartest girl I've ever known.

336
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:38,944
And if it were possible, I'd marry
her tomorrow, if she'd let me...

337
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:41,467
Enough! Enough! It's all clear now.

338
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:46,651
To begin with you brought her here.
- Come on, Mum!

339
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:48,821
Listen to me, try to understand.

340
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:52,850
I also have something
to say on this matter.

341
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,972
But without hysterics, for goodness' sake.

342
00:27:56,829 --> 00:28:01,229
It's a serious matter and so we should
talk seriously as we do in this house.

343
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,303
Giulia and I won't have coffee.

344
00:28:08,568 --> 00:28:10,768
Excuse us, we're going to terrace.

345
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Excuse me.

346
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,797
Forgive me, Mr. Ortona,

347
00:28:19,134 --> 00:28:23,997
but of course, between parents, it shouldn't
be difficult to talk about these things.

348
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,756
- You... - Thanks.
- .. with your beliefs..

349
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:31,550
yes, well,
with a religion different than ours...

350
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:34,513
- No, that's fine.
- What do you think about..

351
00:28:35,397 --> 00:28:37,397
the marriage of your daughter?

352
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:40,874
The marriage?
But what's all this about?

353
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,646
Unless Giulia...
I didn't know that Giulia...

354
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,899
The Germans will persecute you too
if you have a Jewish wife.

355
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:51,113
It would be worse for both of us.

356
00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:54,286
All the young people of
my age have already fled.

357
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,446
For now, we medical students
are using the hospitals,

358
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:59,566
but soon I'll have to hide too.

359
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,578
Then I am right, I'd be a burden
for you. It would be absurd.

360
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,097
Giulia, you have not yet
told me that you love me.

361
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:12,261
It's not absurd to want to be happy.

362
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:16,525
And if this happiness were to end, Massimo?

363
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,470
Everything in the world ends. It's
just important that it happened.

364
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,738
Smile at me, Giulia.
Smile at me.

365
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,508
Go on, move.
- Go and collect the receipt.

366
00:29:52,578 --> 00:29:55,341
Madam, take a seat. Have patience.
Next please.

367
00:29:59,318 --> 00:30:02,591
- What's this?
- Don't worry, they're clean.

368
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:05,165
It's not because of that
but what will you do now?

369
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:08,830
For everything you can find to
eat nowadays, I don't need them.

370
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,550
- You're right. Next. - Thank you.
- Go ahead for the receipt.

371
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,377
It's a salt shaker.

372
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,230
It's gold, right?

373
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,384
Certainly.
But you're Mrs. Di Veroli?

374
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:27,583
- I sold it to you, don't you remember?
- Oh, sorry, I didn't recognize you.

375
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,692
A very long time ago now, Mr. Piperno.

376
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:36,655
- Madam... - Never mind,
I'll send her the receipt. Next please.

377
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,896
Just think, they were among
the richest in the community.

378
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,389
Weigh it, go on.

379
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:44,049
<i>Terracina Angelo.</i>

380
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,765
<i>Mrs. Di Veroli, fifty-four grams.</i>

381
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:49,039
<i>Terracina Angelo, fifteen grams.</i>

382
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,176
<i>Let's go, quickly please. Name?</i>

383
00:30:52,909 --> 00:30:54,481
Your name, madam?

384
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,756
- Anonymous. - But for the receipt?
- Don't bother.

385
00:30:57,826 --> 00:31:00,026
- No receipt.
- Very well, madam.

386
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:03,088
- I'll write 'a Christian' then.
- As you wish.

387
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,119
No, no, you may beat it.

388
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,790
Rather than let it
in the hands of the Germans.

389
00:31:11,513 --> 00:31:14,189
If you agree, we can do a first check.

390
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:16,788
I think we can,
there's already a few kilos.

391
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:17,956
Come in.

392
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,800
May I?

393
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:26,821
Amalfi... Amalfi Simone.

394
00:31:28,242 --> 00:31:32,212
I had a bakery.
Perhaps you gentlemen remember it.

395
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,976
Then the government stripped me of
my licence and so I had to close it.

396
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:39,179
- Sure, I remember it well.
- I tried to keep count.

397
00:31:39,882 --> 00:31:42,062
There's no more than seven kilos.

398
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:46,814
It's already six. Tonight by the curfew,
we'll need to stop collecting.

399
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,861
There's not much time left,
we won't make it, trust me.

400
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:53,969
There's a lot of people, but not enough.

401
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:58,005
- We would need many more.
- Yes, it's true, but you know...

402
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,453
Sadly that's how it is.
We need to face reality.

403
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,761
You were right to come to me.

404
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:07,870
But I ask you not to go around
saying these things.

405
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,591
I won't say anything to anyone.
Indeed, excuse me, excuse me.

406
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,501
Look, stay here, don't go over there.

407
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,110
I've got the impression
that this poor chap...

408
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:21,232
We're in trouble if
he spreads this despair.

409
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,623
That poor chap scares me.

410
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,028
We need to do something soon,
that man is right.

411
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:32,350
From now on check the weight hour by hour.
Start weighing the gold right away.

412
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,502
Look. We would need
one of these for her too.

413
00:32:36,572 --> 00:32:39,963
Massimo De Santis,
born 18th of March 1926.

414
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,383
- But you were born in 1922.
- Don't you get it? It's a fake ID.

415
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:47,736
The town hall of Ceprano was bombed.
They can never prove that it's fake.

416
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:51,105
And now we'll talk about the marriage.
It's feasible.

417
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:54,275
At this time there is also
a special dispensation,

418
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:59,194
conversion to Catholicism wouldn't be
necessary, but I had a very delicate task.

419
00:32:59,551 --> 00:33:03,730
- From my mother? - Exactly. Your mother
wants a Catholic daughter-in-law.

420
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,067
A fair request. I repeat, it's not the
church who demands it but your family.

421
00:33:08,137 --> 00:33:11,630
It's prejudice, I understand, but it
exists and has to be taken into account.

422
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:16,120
I thought this concerned only us. I
didn't think I had racists in my family.

423
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:20,178
You can't say that. It's difficult
to fight against old ideas.

424
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,438
I understand you very well,
but I have my responsibilities.

425
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:25,844
And then I'm not the only priest in Rome.

426
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:28,285
Thank you, you've done all you could.

427
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:32,094
Massimo, you'll create a rift
with your mother if you carry on so.

428
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:34,632
Forgive me, Miss, but I
wanted you to be aware too.

429
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:37,003
You did the right thing;
it's better to know everything.

430
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:39,971
A rift? It will be her who
will have asked for it.

431
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,615
- And now? - Nothing,
it's exactly the same for us.

432
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,936
Everyone, everyone against us,
ready to strike us.

433
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,853
But why? What have we done?

434
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:03,204
It's my fault, I've caused only
trouble for you. For your father too.

435
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,049
We need to warn him. In fact, Giulia,
tonight you'll stay with close friends,

436
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:10,772
and tomorrow I'll find
a priest who's not my relative.

437
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,936
I want do things properly, understand?

438
00:34:13,006 --> 00:34:15,627
You're willing to disobey your parents?

439
00:34:16,412 --> 00:34:18,634
It's a lesson for them,
so they'll understand.

440
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:20,904
It's our future, we can't give in!

441
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,211
Massimo...

442
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:27,816
Now, Giulia, listen to me carefully.
You need to trust me.

443
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:30,123
Don't be scared.

444
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,670
No one can ever separate us.

445
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,108
You don't even ask me if I agree.

446
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:43,412
Since yesterday you do everything alone.
And what am I to do?

447
00:34:45,486 --> 00:34:46,989
I love you.

448
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:58,331
Here we go: Vittorio, Alberto,
Gianni, Mario, Samuele, Angelo,

449
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,505
Settimio, Abramo, Pierpaolo.

450
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,631
Here we go: eight male children.

451
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:08,051
Four kilos and two hundred grams.

452
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:11,574
- Twelve kilos and a few grams.
- Are you sure?

453
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,855
Twelve kilos.
I really thought there was more.

454
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:18,814
That guy was right.
We won't make it if it goes on like this.

455
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:28,310
- How is it going?
- Forget it.

456
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,032
- Did you weigh it?
- How much?

457
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:33,820
I don't know, I don't know. What do you
want me to say? I'm only the doorman.

458
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,826
- Why won't you tell us? - I don't know
anything! It's no use insisting!

459
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:40,297
- Here's your receipt, ma'am.
- Thank you, thank you.

460
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,533
<i>Did you weigh it, at least?
Can't you tell us how much is there?</i>

461
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:46,941
<i>I told you, I don't know anything.
What should I tell you?</i>

462
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:50,692
- What's happened?
- Nothing, madam, it's nothing.

463
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,030
<i>- They don't want to tell us.
- But why don't they?</i>

464
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:56,614
So we won't make it?

465
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,330
<i>Relax, madam. Stay calm, everyone.</i>

466
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:03,957
It's insane. It's insane to
place our hopes in gold.

467
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,420
Only the Lord will be able to warm
the hearts of our persecutors.

468
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,368
Gold.. Gold!

469
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,337
The Germans have thrust this false
idol upon us and we adore it.

470
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,507
Since yesterday we pray for
gold and not to the Lord.

471
00:36:19,212 --> 00:36:25,058
Reconcile yourself with Him instead!
For millenniums, He never abandoned us.

472
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,333
But what do you think?
That I haven't been praying?

473
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,811
I've spent entire days just talking to Him.

474
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:36,020
But it doesn't help!
It's not true that our God helps us!

475
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,980
He's abandoned us. And my children?
Are they bound to die?

476
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:42,361
You want them to be taken as hostages?

477
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,985
The gold won't be enough.
It won't be enough.

478
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:48,630
I suggest that it's returned to the owners.

479
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,114
No one wants to pray anymore.
You've all forgotten our faith,

480
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,769
so everything is lost,
our people are lost!

481
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,738
Will you shut up, rabbi?

482
00:37:02,894 --> 00:37:04,651
Mum, take me away.

483
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,459
Calm down, calm down, brothers, friends.

484
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,373
Listen! - Quiet!
- Stay calm.

485
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,953
We've got to stay calm.

486
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,146
- Here we are.
- Very well.

487
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:35,854
- Evening, Mr. Amalfi.
- Good evening.

488
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,934
- What's happened?
- We can't make it. We can't make it.

489
00:39:30,732 --> 00:39:33,794
- Who's that crackpot?
- No, it's a priest.

490
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,081
It's a Jew, yes, a Jew,
inform the Italian police.

491
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:33,269
This is the ghetto.

492
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:42,181
Here, there and also over here
are the small groups of Jews,

493
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:44,375
but the action must be
concentrated here.

494
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,430
In the ghetto there are
around two thousand Jews.

495
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:51,250
The ghetto is easily dealt with.
There are four access points.

496
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,070
Here a single troop is enough.

497
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,592
Here we only need thirty men.

498
00:40:58,964 --> 00:41:01,714
Again, thirty men are
more than enough here.

499
00:41:02,553 --> 00:41:06,303
According to the phone reports,
they will not get the gold,

500
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:09,243
and we are inoperative.
Read me the plan.

501
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,328
For capture and transport,
three thousand men are set aside.

502
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:17,237
Five platoons in battle formation,
seven tons worth of trucks,

503
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:20,597
forty of them subject to change,
twelve carriages at a minimum.

504
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:24,017
Means of disinfection: ninety kilos
of creolin. A medic.

505
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:28,125
Competent controls at the carriages.
Three platoons with an officer.

506
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,523
A field kitchen. Supplies to military
regulations. Full field equipment.

507
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:36,039
Plus some vegetarian food
for the deportees.

508
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:39,203
- So do we have all that?
- Two weeks ago we made a request to

509
00:41:39,273 --> 00:41:42,196
Field Marshal Kesselring's command,
but without reply.

510
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:45,148
You can thank the interference of
the consul for these difficulties.

511
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,338
- There's no-one around.
- What should we do. - Follow me.

512
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,499
Would you like to know what's behind
this wall? I'll show you now.

513
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:39,026
Take this.

514
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,404
Here we go.
Turn the light off.

515
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,226
<i>Go on, enter, don't be scared.</i>

516
00:43:12,725 --> 00:43:14,833
Here we are, we've made it!

517
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,764
Your workshop? And who'd ever suspect it?

518
00:43:17,834 --> 00:43:21,065
Understand, big head?
They'll never catch us in their trap.

519
00:43:24,726 --> 00:43:26,134
Now go away.

520
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:29,110
Back the same way, so you won't forget.

521
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:33,449
I'll get our shoes ready. In half an hour
everyone ready for departure. OK?

522
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,390
Ah, it's you.

523
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,516
Now I understand why you don't
even greet when you pass my shop.

524
00:44:40,354 --> 00:44:41,604
You're going.

525
00:44:46,262 --> 00:44:47,912
Tell the truth, Giulia.

526
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,892
Are you ashamed to have gone
to a Jewish school with us?

527
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:56,320
Me? Why?
No, I'm not ashamed at all.

528
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,100
Do you remember what
they made us recite?

529
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,695
Today slavery, tomorrow freedom.

530
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:17,175
Here this year,
next year in the land of Israel.

531
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:21,131
Thousands of years we repeated that.

532
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:23,525
How naive!

533
00:45:25,068 --> 00:45:28,519
But in these words there's something
that moves me even today.

534
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:34,862
And you would forget everything?

535
00:45:43,091 --> 00:45:44,241
I remember...

536
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:47,439
We all had a little crush on you.

537
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,020
You were the sweetest, the most beautiful.

538
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:53,713
And intelligent too!

539
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:59,441
We used to always say,
"Look how they are, these Jewish girls."

540
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,249
- I was really pretty?
- Yes, very beautiful.

541
00:46:05,623 --> 00:46:07,960
I would've kissed
the ground beneath your feet.

542
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,352
<i>But now it's different.
Are you going?</i>

543
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,030
You chose the perfect moment,
that can't be denied.

544
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,653
<i>But of course, being Jewish
is not easy at this time.</i>

545
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,000
Better get yourself a Catholic fiancé,
a husband, and blend in with the others.

546
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,077
Davide, you're offending me.
Don't you realise that?

547
00:46:28,547 --> 00:46:30,847
And I thought you were so different.

548
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,075
One can be so wrong at times!

549
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,770
But in the end...

550
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,630
you're really beautiful.
That's something.

551
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,481
- Are you crazy?
- Why, because I'm a Jew?

552
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:55,184
You're nothing but a pretty face.

553
00:46:56,783 --> 00:46:58,733
A shame, you deserved better.

554
00:47:01,378 --> 00:47:04,174
Bye, Giulia. And good luck.

555
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:07,574
Go away!

556
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:10,676
Go away!

557
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:22,097
Get on your bikes!
Come on, pedal!

558
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,697
Giulia!

559
00:47:33,423 --> 00:47:36,816
Hi, Giulia.
Any news?

560
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,270
- Did Massimo call you? - Yes, yes.
For that reason I rushed here.

561
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,574
You should have hinted something at least.

562
00:47:45,644 --> 00:47:49,328
Sure, it's more difficult with your
father, but I hoped that you'd trust me.

563
00:47:49,398 --> 00:47:53,841
And then arguing with his parents
isn't the best start.

564
00:47:54,512 --> 00:47:59,918
I understand with such a mother in law..
But going away like this, by yourselves..

565
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,409
You've really made up your minds?

566
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:08,346
Yes, I think so.

567
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,250
I always admired Massimo.

568
00:48:14,707 --> 00:48:16,157
And now I love him.

569
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,110
Next to him I feel different.
I'm no longer scared.

570
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:52,036
<i>Our poor people!</i>

571
00:48:54,102 --> 00:48:56,410
Come on, let's go, go.

572
00:49:02,954 --> 00:49:06,568
Why did you do this, my brother? Why?

573
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,050
This way, this way!

574
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,897
You see, my beloved Fiorenzo..

575
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:32,771
Such nonsense shouldn't be done.

576
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,289
- No.
- Be strong! Pass me a seat.

577
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:41,529
Otherwise, what do we do?
What do we do?

578
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:49,905
Yet some times...

579
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:52,449
Bah!

580
00:49:55,356 --> 00:49:57,756
You've got other stuff to think about.

581
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,470
Massimo, it's you now
who is responsible.

582
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,938
I'm staying at home,
I've already told Giulia.

583
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,110
There's no need to say goodbye,
as we'll see each other tomorrow.

584
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,544
Listen, come here.

585
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,018
- I don't have anything else.
- And you, Dad? - I?

586
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:20,530
But this was your mother's, yours
by right. I've got my pension, heck!

587
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:22,425
Dad, I'm coming with you.

588
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,335
What are you saying? Massimo!
What sort of fiancé are you?

589
00:50:26,847 --> 00:50:28,551
Make her see reason.

590
00:50:29,413 --> 00:50:33,539
Go, go, tomorrow you'll marry
and give me great joy.

591
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:38,205
Giulia, your Dad wants you
to come along with me.

592
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:41,213
Yes.
Absolutely, absolutely.

593
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,171
What can they do to us old folks?
You youngsters need to hide yourselves.

594
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:55,298
Dad, what if I stay here tonight?

595
00:52:43,056 --> 00:52:44,252
Poor Rosa.

596
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:47,698
Did you see, Giulia? Did you see?

597
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,536
He was scared that
we wouldn't get all the gold.

598
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:54,336
He was such a good man!

599
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,296
Here, take it.
It's the last that we have.

600
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,390
But, wait...
you hadn't already given it?

601
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:47,296
Did you see? They haven't given their
gold. They've still got it at home.

602
00:53:47,366 --> 00:53:50,146
Why are we here? There's no more time.
What are we waiting for?

603
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:52,303
They have to give it.
They have to!

604
00:53:57,254 --> 00:54:00,406
Calm down, Giulia!
Come on, stop!

605
00:54:01,395 --> 00:54:05,171
- Giulia, Giulia, don't cry!
- Massimo! Massimo...

606
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,410
- What do you want?
- We want to speak with Mr. Giovanni.

607
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:13,108
Mr. Giovanni, they want to speak
with you no matter what.

608
00:54:13,178 --> 00:54:15,136
No, no. I don't want to see anyone.

609
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,930
The gold that you took, where is it?

610
00:54:21,219 --> 00:54:22,714
Smash down the door!

611
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,510
No, you can't!
Are you all crazy?!

612
00:54:27,671 --> 00:54:29,572
<i>Mr. Giovanni!</i>

613
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:36,219
- Stop! Stop! Let go of me!
- Here mom, get it! <i>- This is assault!</i>

614
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:42,573
What do you want with me? Let me go!
You'll regret this!

615
00:54:45,634 --> 00:54:48,019
Help! Help!

616
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,624
- Did you find it?
- Yes, it must be in here.

617
00:54:50,733 --> 00:54:54,750
Don't you realise that even if you give
them the gold, you won't be saved?

618
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:58,899
- Listen, listen, I've got an idea.
- Let him speak!

619
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,033
How many of us are there?
Five, six families?

620
00:55:02,103 --> 00:55:04,228
Good, leave it all to me.
I'll hide you.

621
00:55:04,298 --> 00:55:07,048
I have many friends,
leave everything to me.

622
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,110
Enough! Damn scum!

623
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,553
Far away from here
no one will recognise you.

624
00:55:11,623 --> 00:55:14,843
Don't give the gold to them!
Don't give it to them!

625
00:55:14,913 --> 00:55:19,311
It won't save you! It's futile!
It's futile!

626
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,744
Who knows what he's looking for up there.

627
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:33,101
He wants to take a photo of you.
Can't you see?

628
00:55:34,178 --> 00:55:36,448
Imagine if he landed here near us.

629
00:55:37,246 --> 00:55:38,790
Climb in and away.

630
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:41,395
<i>Where would you go?</i>

631
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:44,573
Well, maybe to Palestine.

632
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:47,376
There at least everyone is like us.

633
00:55:48,355 --> 00:55:49,407
And then?

634
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:55,970
Do you really believe it's better there
than here? With the Arabs, the British?

635
00:55:57,162 --> 00:55:59,412
They aren't like the Germans, sure.

636
00:56:00,545 --> 00:56:02,817
But for us it's the same everywhere.

637
00:56:02,887 --> 00:56:05,862
<i>But why do they have it in for us?
I never understood it.</i>

638
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,880
Because it's convenient.

639
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,169
Wars, shortages,
the government is never at fault.

640
00:56:12,844 --> 00:56:14,944
The blame is always on the Jews.

641
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,877
Just write it in the papers,
and everyone believes it.

642
00:56:18,771 --> 00:56:22,941
But after all this bloodshed, let's hope
there's a better future for my son.

643
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,460
Otherwise it is better to become Buddhists,
and do away with all of this.

644
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:29,287
Quiet!

645
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,590
- What have you heard?
- It's not yet midnight.

646
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,010
Surely they can't be here already.

647
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:53,775
After the war things will change.

648
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:56,791
Palestine?

649
00:56:58,354 --> 00:56:59,805
That's a great idea.

650
00:57:00,426 --> 00:57:03,828
But I am from Rome, Italian,
why should I go over there?

651
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,456
Who did I ever bother here?

652
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,870
A bit of respect would suffice.

653
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,648
- That they let us be.
- Yeah, you hope!

654
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,198
Even after it'll still be as it always was.

655
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:22,489
No, it won't be like that.
Things are changing.

656
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:25,766
- Provided that...
<i>- Provided that?</i>

657
00:57:26,706 --> 00:57:29,009
Even a dog rebels
when being mistreated.

658
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,370
But we never do, never!

659
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:35,822
No one has the courage to open their
mouths. All we know is to accept it.

660
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:39,550
But things have to change.
It must change!

661
00:57:44,146 --> 00:57:45,379
Here they are!

662
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,226
<i>- How does it work?
- You stick the magazine here.</i>

663
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:54,456
<i>Then draw it back.
Try it out.</i>

664
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,897
- Have you given everyone weapons?
- Yes, everyone.

665
00:57:59,663 --> 00:58:01,659
What are you doing? You crazy?

666
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,609
There's loads of Germans here.
- Yeah, you're right. But, you see..

667
00:58:06,573 --> 00:58:10,133
It's magnificent!
It's amazing!

668
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:14,769
This morning early.
Yes, certainly.

669
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,176
As much as possible.
We have to deliver it at midday.

670
00:58:18,823 --> 00:58:22,395
We're way behind.
I implore you.

671
00:58:23,257 --> 00:58:24,807
Thank you, thank you.

672
00:58:32,393 --> 00:58:35,515
- So, what shall we do?
- We'll do like the others: let's give it.

673
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:39,910
I don't care, we're discriminated.
It really doesn't concern us.

674
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:43,110
- I'm so scared.
- We need to leave right now.

675
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:46,699
- Yes, I'll let the others know.
- And you call me at this time?

676
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:49,070
But I don't have anything else.

677
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,483
Gold? And where should I find it?

678
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,428
- It's extortion.
- Is there any hope?

679
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:56,929
- But it's impossible.
- Hostages?

680
00:58:57,436 --> 00:58:58,930
- No.
- Yes.

681
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:02,009
- I don't have anything else.
- OK, we'll try.

682
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:05,497
His Excellency?
Yes, His Excellency.

683
00:59:06,508 --> 00:59:09,710
Yes, wake him up.
It's a vital matter.

684
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:13,291
OK, understood, I'll go right away.

685
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:19,574
<i>Hello?</i>

686
00:59:21,656 --> 00:59:23,856
Yes, as soon as the curfew is over.

687
00:59:24,132 --> 00:59:27,575
Yes, I'll come at seven.
That's fine.

688
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,430
Will you go to him?

689
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,539
Yes, we have to try everything.

690
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,526
I'm beginning to despair.

691
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:46,252
How... how would they select the hostages?

692
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,735
Yes, Marshall.

693
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:07,702
It is common knowledge that the Jews
will not have enough gold.

694
01:00:07,828 --> 01:00:12,001
Unfortunately, my commando is not in a
position to carry out the deportation.

695
01:00:12,289 --> 01:00:14,750
Yes, please give your assistance.

696
01:00:20,124 --> 01:00:23,006
I want my gold back, understand?
My gold.

697
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,464
Three kilos worth
and I want them back right away.

698
01:00:26,636 --> 01:00:29,151
Right away, otherwise
I'll denounce you to the Germans.

699
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,193
They broke down my door.
They wanted to lynch me!

700
01:00:32,326 --> 01:00:34,770
But I'll have them thrown in jail!

701
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,830
- And that other son of a...
- Calm down. Don't shout.

702
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,837
We didn't know anything about it.
Why don't you sit down?

703
01:00:40,907 --> 01:00:45,293
Here's my gold. They robbed me.
They robbed me. A burglary!

704
01:00:45,363 --> 01:00:48,390
Three kilos! Three kilos!
Let's not joke!

705
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,303
I want everything back. Everything!

706
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,528
Maybe things are the way you say,
but I have a proposal.

707
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,697
This gold, all or part of it,
we can buy it.

708
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,708
Sir, you see,
we're hardly getting to 50 kilos.

709
01:01:00,778 --> 01:01:04,820
We've 5 hours to noon. If now you
take away three, it will be a disaster.

710
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:06,930
Three kilos is massive for us.

711
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:10,329
And what will you give me in payment?
Sterling? Dollars?

712
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:13,272
- What are you saying? Now?
- It's toilet paper, no?

713
01:01:13,342 --> 01:01:15,319
You'll give me toilet paper.

714
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:18,870
I want the gold. The gold is mine.
I earnt it!

715
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,335
<i>I earnt it with the sweat of my brow.</i>

716
01:01:21,405 --> 01:01:23,662
And I want it back. I want it all.

717
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:25,721
Every single last gram!

718
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:28,403
- Stop, stop, stop it!
- It's all mine!

719
01:01:29,549 --> 01:01:33,819
I'll have the gold returned to you,
but stop with this scene.

720
01:01:35,468 --> 01:01:37,325
His Excellency awaits you.

721
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:44,201
Yes, OK, very well.

722
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:49,330
It's many years, cousin.

723
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,656
I trust you haven't come to burden me
with the trouble in your community.

724
01:01:53,726 --> 01:01:58,220
It was also yours, before you disowned
the name of your father, cousin.

725
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:02,469
I've 7 million in this case.
Collected yesterday lira by lira.

726
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,899
We need 7 kilos of gold, and your bank...

727
01:02:04,969 --> 01:02:08,256
My bank only gets involved in good deals.
That's it.

728
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,630
We need the gold within four hours.

729
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:14,481
Sit down.

730
01:02:16,718 --> 01:02:19,868
- You don't want anything?
A coffee? A cigarette? - No.

731
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,087
What you're asking is absurd.

732
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,411
It's risky. Forbidden by law.

733
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,384
And I don't regularly do business
with the German command.

734
01:02:27,454 --> 01:02:29,950
Otherwise this could merely
be a reallocation of funds.

735
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,956
I consider it a loss-making deal.

736
01:02:34,743 --> 01:02:37,134
No, I don't see any possibility.

737
01:02:39,681 --> 01:02:41,319
I've betrayed you, eh?

738
01:02:41,709 --> 01:02:45,371
It's you who ostracised me,
because I wanted to be like the others.

739
01:02:45,574 --> 01:02:47,951
And rise above your futile pride.

740
01:02:48,565 --> 01:02:50,073
For what I was worth.

741
01:02:50,502 --> 01:02:54,935
And I'm worth a lot, if you deigned
to turn to me at such a time.

742
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:58,677
I'm also flesh and blood like you.

743
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:02,444
It's only that they want to persecute me.

744
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,700
They want to, understand me well, not I.

745
01:03:06,439 --> 01:03:08,018
Because I'm Jewish.

746
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,763
Good or evil, to them doesn't matter,
I'm Jewish and that's enough.

747
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,541
And it's true that I'm Jewish.

748
01:03:15,526 --> 01:03:18,549
But you too are.
You wanted to forget it.

749
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,859
You thought you had succeeded.
But now here I am.

750
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:27,071
I'm here, on mandate of our persecutors,
to remind you of that.

751
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:30,075
I believe we've said everything.

752
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,370
I don't deal in Italian money,
nor in blackmail.

753
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:36,895
Are we understood?

754
01:03:39,188 --> 01:03:40,991
No gold, I'm sorry.

755
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,155
Ludovico.

756
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,145
I was thinking:

757
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:57,442
You have changed little
over the last forty years.

758
01:03:58,177 --> 01:03:59,930
You were an eager Zionist.

759
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,799
Do you still believe in the unwavering
destiny of the Jewish nation?

760
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,440
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

761
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,616
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

762
01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:28,496
- May I sit?
- Please.

763
01:04:37,246 --> 01:04:39,887
Perhaps two blows of the hammer...

764
01:04:40,618 --> 01:04:44,295
The heel is coming away.
Can it be repaired?

765
01:04:44,707 --> 01:04:45,757
Let me see.

766
01:04:48,213 --> 01:04:51,432
If you're happy with a home-made heel,
I can fix it right away.

767
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:58,765
- I was wondering. How old are you?
- Twenty-five, why?

768
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,950
At your age, I wanted to travel
around the world, incredibly so.

769
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:05,870
For the cause of Zion.
I had already organised it.

770
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:09,528
Then the war came, the other one.

771
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:15,537
Tell me frankly:
what would you do in my position?

772
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,980
You already know what
I think about the gold.

773
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,300
I haven't changed my mind.

774
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:24,950
But now I'm not the only one who thinks so.

775
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:27,950
My friends are now as decided
as me about defending ourselves.

776
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,725
And we won't be going to
the concentration camp.

777
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,996
For every Jew, a German.
That's the price to pay.

778
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,830
Let them come and get us.

779
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:39,610
Ask them about it.
Let them try!

780
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,851
You're proposing to me the destruction
of the ghetto? A massacre?

781
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,670
Now the world is against the Germans.

782
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:50,240
Everyone will be with us.
As long as we are ready to fight.

783
01:05:51,398 --> 01:05:52,748
Here, it's ready.

784
01:05:53,187 --> 01:05:55,790
I'm not just the president
for the young people.

785
01:05:56,123 --> 01:06:00,270
In the ghetto there are also children,
women.

786
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,908
Well? What do you propose?

787
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:09,654
If they grant us an extension,
we'll make it. I'm convinced.

788
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,348
And after?

789
01:06:12,127 --> 01:06:13,927
They will keep their word.

790
01:06:15,713 --> 01:06:17,563
There's nothing else to do.

791
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:20,497
<i>Listen.</i>

792
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,130
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
They'll keep their word.

793
01:06:28,793 --> 01:06:31,965
They've sworn to exterminate us,
and this is the word they'll keep!

794
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:42,660
Believe me, we're convinced that
we can meet your request,

795
01:06:43,373 --> 01:06:49,314
if we could only get three or
four more hours, until six.

796
01:06:49,807 --> 01:06:52,702
- OK.
- Still nothing from Kesserling?

797
01:06:52,772 --> 01:06:56,369
No, Major, the trucks aren't there yet.
The wagons are still occupied.

798
01:06:57,525 --> 01:07:00,751
So we shall grant them the extension.

799
01:07:01,627 --> 01:07:04,377
In the meantime,
go and press for an answer.

800
01:07:05,144 --> 01:07:07,422
Even with the delay, it might not succeed.

801
01:07:08,377 --> 01:07:11,110
Stay alert.
We must convey this situation.

802
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:14,507
I will personally write to a
Field Marshall, you only need to go.

803
01:07:14,577 --> 01:07:15,762
Yes, Major.

804
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:20,708
Grant them until... six.

805
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:25,915
An extension of six hours has
been granted, until six.

806
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:29,637
- OK.
- Good, it's the final deadline.

807
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:31,592
Final deadline.

808
01:07:31,903 --> 01:07:33,616
Yes!
Thank you.

809
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:36,297
I'm not Jewish.

810
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:39,933
And besides I only have one of them.
Look.

811
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,330
However, if you'll accept it.

812
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,779
- Dear lady, everything helps.
- Thank goodness. - Thank you.

813
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:48,241
I'm the secretary of His Excellency.

814
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:49,979
Yes, I imagine so.

815
01:07:51,396 --> 01:07:53,096
Right away, that's fine.

816
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:59,421
Please, those who have already
given their gold, leave.

817
01:08:05,238 --> 01:08:07,291
Wait a sec,
I want to see what happens.

818
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:10,413
So, those who have yet to give,
go on this side.

819
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,649
The secretary of His Excellency is here.
He's brought gold!

820
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:42,025
<i>There's seven kilos exactly.</i>

821
01:08:43,929 --> 01:08:46,417
Tell His Excellency that we thank him.
- Very well.

822
01:08:46,487 --> 01:08:49,144
The payment when the president comes.
- Very well, I'll wait.

823
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:51,132
There must be about 47 kilos.

824
01:08:52,981 --> 01:08:56,763
Forgive me, Monsignor, if I insisted
on speaking so hurriedly.

825
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,791
I must make an urgent request.

826
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,758
Maybe you've already understood
what it concerns.

827
01:09:03,828 --> 01:09:06,054
Speak, speak freely.

828
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:11,470
Indeed, I hope you'll understand the
precautions I had to take for this meeting.

829
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,740
All of Rome is under surveillance.

830
01:09:18,441 --> 01:09:21,379
Certainly, I understand well
the seriousness of things.

831
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:25,929
But it's a commitment that's so...
for such a vast amount...

832
01:09:26,494 --> 01:09:29,029
If at least I had the time to consult.

833
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:32,607
However, you must not lose heart.

834
01:09:32,996 --> 01:09:35,510
Keep going, you still have several hours.

835
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:40,092
If not, we'll loan you the gold
that may be missing.

836
01:09:42,809 --> 01:09:46,727
- And about the reimbursement?
- When the community is able to.

837
01:09:46,797 --> 01:09:49,497
Thank you,
we're counting on it, Monsignor.

838
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:54,136
We'll try and make it by ourselves,
but you have reassured me.

839
01:09:55,381 --> 01:09:58,967
- I'd get back to the community now.
- To Lungotevere Cenci.

840
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,940
I already know what will happen later.

841
01:10:02,644 --> 01:10:05,902
Will the Germans be done with us
after this piece of blackmail?

842
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:10,402
What does the Vatican think?
Do you have any information?

843
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,910
Maybe I shouldn't. I'm sorry.

844
01:10:15,205 --> 01:10:18,852
But our frame of mind in these hours..
- I completely understand.

845
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,758
But who can say what
the Germans have in mind?

846
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:28,619
Indeed.
Who can say?

847
01:10:31,246 --> 01:10:33,373
<i>- Add the 7 kilos.
- No, it's not possible.</i>

848
01:10:33,443 --> 01:10:37,049
<i>- Let's not get confused, wait a minute.
- Yes, 43 kilos 300.</i>

849
01:10:37,351 --> 01:10:40,821
But if you add the 7 kilos...
50 kilos 300!

850
01:10:41,377 --> 01:10:45,936
- 50 kilos 300!
- We have got 50 kilos 300.

851
01:10:46,433 --> 01:10:48,014
<i>We've made it!</i>

852
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,739
Dad, the president is coming!

853
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:04,122
- What are they saying? Is it true?
- Your cousin... 7 kilos!

854
01:11:04,192 --> 01:11:07,370
He sold it to us.
He accepted our funds in payment.

855
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,171
It's over.

856
01:11:13,808 --> 01:11:15,013
We've done it.

857
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,910
- Finally I feel like someone else.
- Yes, Giulia.

858
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:22,830
Now we'll just think of each other, right?
Us two and no one else.

859
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,576
Put the cupboard in place, quick.

860
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,618
It's over! We're saved!
We're all saved!

861
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:05,578
Our children are safe, get it? Safe!
And woe if you do something wrong.

862
01:12:05,757 --> 01:12:09,124
- We're here. - So, what do you want?
- The collection is over, we did it.

863
01:12:09,194 --> 01:12:10,983
What do you think you solved?
You crazy?

864
01:12:11,053 --> 01:12:13,798
Leave them be now.
It's better it ended like this.

865
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:16,334
We could've had the Germans at home today!

866
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,694
<i>Vincenzo! Vincenzo!</i>

867
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,453
You've already calmed down, huh?

868
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:32,663
Close the door.

869
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,790
And now what are you thinking of doing?

870
01:12:37,902 --> 01:12:40,437
You must do something,
they're all deluded.

871
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:42,688
Everyone thinks that now there's no danger.

872
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:46,550
- It's late, the Germans are waiting.
- It's not a crime to hope, sonny.

873
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:49,530
You think that all this
doesn't sadden and humiliate me?

874
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,750
But I'll manage to obligate them,
at least on a moral level.

875
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:57,416
And I ask you, in fact I order you:
no more trouble.

876
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:04,630
And no stupidity. Woe betide
if we gave them any excuse.

877
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,513
Any excuse?
But what excuse have we given them so far?

878
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:10,739
Which?

879
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,345
5 kilos.

880
01:13:28,351 --> 01:13:29,553
50 kilos.

881
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:33,558
Watch out, this is fraud.
There aren't 50 kilos.

882
01:13:37,441 --> 01:13:40,491
No, this is fraud.
There is only 45 kilos, not 50.

883
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,210
This is absurd. 10 receptacles,
5 kilos each.

884
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,034
Look here, look: 6 and 4 is 10.
There are 50 kilos.

885
01:13:49,222 --> 01:13:51,110
- This is absurd.
- Absurd?

886
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:54,372
No, I was saying,
there are 50 kilos. 50 kilos 300.

887
01:13:54,442 --> 01:13:56,476
We've brought 300 grams extra.

888
01:13:56,661 --> 01:13:59,229
We can repeat the weighing if you wish.

889
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:02,823
There are 10 boxes and each
contains 5 kilos in it.

890
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:06,728
- President!
- 9 or 10boxes, it's a fraud.

891
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:12,235
Again in batches in 5
Recheck everything, even the carats.

892
01:14:18,843 --> 01:14:22,931
And if the 5 kilos are missing,
I'll take it as a personal affront.

893
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,277
We are not some crooks.
We've fulfilled our commitment.

894
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,909
I hope you will keep yours.

895
01:14:35,936 --> 01:14:38,410
One day it could be
the other way around.

896
01:14:38,658 --> 01:14:41,490
And we could find ourselves
on that side of the table...

897
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,553
in your place,
and you here, in ours.

898
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,836
<i>I'm the Police Commissioner</i>

899
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,592
who escorted these gentlemen here
to avoid a potential robbery.

900
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:57,220
On my honour as state official, I guarantee,
Major, that the weight is correct.

901
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:02,137
I only asked for better controls.
No time to lose. Get started again.

902
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,953
Alberto! Alberto!

903
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:42,403
Amerigo!

904
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,034
Violence must be condemned by society.

905
01:16:03,403 --> 01:16:05,736
People must become united once again.

906
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,349
Children of a single creator...
of one God.

907
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:15,752
<i>Our law tells how to reach
this different, renewed world:</i>

908
01:16:16,206 --> 01:16:21,631
<i>the Messianic world.
So then.. Therefore our duty...</i>

909
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,792
How did it go?

910
01:16:36,004 --> 01:16:38,654
The weighing was worse than the collection.

911
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:44,070
But at least a receipt, something,
a guarantee, in short?

912
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,434
No, nothing.

913
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:03,991
Because I believe, believe with every
ounce of my being more than ever...

914
01:17:05,031 --> 01:17:09,670
that the destiny of man is different.
Different... better.

915
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,874
And in the name of God, it is man who
must create this destiny for himself.

916
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:17,395
Each man with his own hands.

917
01:17:18,283 --> 01:17:20,798
According to the codes of our law.

918
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:23,052
Age old.

919
01:17:24,143 --> 01:17:25,419
Merciful.

920
01:19:01,598 --> 01:19:03,832
Giulia, I wanted to apologise for yesterday.

921
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,101
You thought I was a traitor, right?

922
01:19:10,368 --> 01:19:12,710
You wanted to teach me a lesson, right?

923
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,232
But what should we do
if not try to survive...

924
01:19:18,526 --> 01:19:20,976
to be happy for the little that we can.

925
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:26,538
You must live, Giulia.
Free yourself from everything.

926
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,630
What I said yesterday was nonsense.

927
01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:34,564
You were right.

928
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,870
One can't be who they want here.

929
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:43,851
We're the first to not want this.

930
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:46,982
In the past we were a courageous people.

931
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,198
But for too long we had not
the courage to stand up tall.

932
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,068
You know, I'm gonna leave too.

933
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,780
And where are you going?

934
01:19:59,543 --> 01:20:01,143
I decided moments ago.

935
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,371
I will regroup with my friends
who are already on the run.

936
01:20:04,753 --> 01:20:07,917
So I will no longer be a struggling Jew,
but an Italian.

937
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,512
An Italian like many others,
who fights against the Germans.

938
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,490
You know,..

939
01:20:14,303 --> 01:20:18,602
I would have wanted to talk to you,
ask you many things.

940
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,883
How we've changed, Davide.

941
01:20:25,596 --> 01:20:28,194
If I disappointed you, I'm sorry.

942
01:20:30,134 --> 01:20:32,390
I too wanted to be goodness knows what.

943
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,509
And instead..
I'm any old girl.

944
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,878
You did everything yourself.
And you're the best of all of us.

945
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:46,533
Giulia?

946
01:20:49,226 --> 01:20:50,412
Giulia?

947
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:53,658
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

948
01:20:54,414 --> 01:20:56,635
Mrs. Giulia De Santis. Look.

949
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:02,359
On this piece of paper we're
already married. Are you pleased?

950
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:06,709
And I've even found a great apartment.
It's well hidden.

951
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:15,945
Davide.

952
01:21:29,278 --> 01:21:30,540
Bye, Giulia.

953
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,420
He was my old friend here in the ghetto.

954
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:06,830
Here's another link that's broken.

955
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,210
You don't have to sacrifice
anything for me, Giulia.

956
01:22:12,496 --> 01:22:15,113
Not even the smallest thing,
I don't want it.

957
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,516
Are you sure that you'll
never end up regretting it?

958
01:22:20,533 --> 01:22:22,683
I'm asking you for the last time.

959
01:22:23,261 --> 01:22:27,963
Massimo, you don't love a Jewish girl,
who has loads of problems to solve,

960
01:22:29,227 --> 01:22:32,390
but you love me, Giulia.

961
01:22:33,336 --> 01:22:34,436
Only Giulia.

962
01:22:35,601 --> 01:22:37,901
A girl who's smitten and that's all.

963
01:23:25,942 --> 01:23:26,944
Fire!

964
01:23:40,328 --> 01:23:41,542
Fire!

965
01:23:51,176 --> 01:23:52,496
<i>Fire!</i>

966
01:23:54,385 --> 01:23:57,554
<i>If he gets the machine gun back,
he'll kill all of us.</i>

967
01:23:59,085 --> 01:24:03,258
<i>Kill him!
Why don't you kill him?</i>

968
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,650
Buddy, this isn't the life for you.

969
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,837
Change while you can.
It's better for everyone.

970
01:24:58,184 --> 01:24:59,225
But why?

971
01:25:03,013 --> 01:25:04,638
Killing disgusts me.

972
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:10,783
For five thousand years, we Jews have
preached about the horror of bloodshed.

973
01:25:13,312 --> 01:25:14,762
But today I saw it.

974
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:19,859
I've learned.

975
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,605
<i>What are we waiting for?
For the Germans to raise the alarm?</i>

976
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,585
Davide is coming with us,
by now he too has become one of us.

977
01:25:29,617 --> 01:25:31,710
Come, come on.

978
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:07,432
Listen, darling, a short while ago
I felt a little feverish.

979
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,880
Maybe it's better... after all,
it's very early. I'll stay home.

980
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,439
Yes, Dad. It's better you stay.

981
01:26:15,869 --> 01:26:17,969
After all this only concerns me.

982
01:26:35,311 --> 01:26:40,927
Giulia, I baptise you in the name
of the Father, the Son...

983
01:26:41,619 --> 01:26:43,913
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

984
01:27:41,388 --> 01:27:46,391
<i>The Germans are here! The Germans
have come to take all the Jews away!</i>

985
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:09,051
<i>Help him!</i>

986
01:28:14,975 --> 01:28:17,430
<i>Sarah! Sarah!</i>

987
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:28,683
<i>Where's mum?
Let her come here with us.</i>

988
01:28:58,272 --> 01:29:00,812
Run!
Jump out the window, quickly!

989
01:29:15,998 --> 01:29:18,215
Giulia! What is it?

990
01:29:19,007 --> 01:29:20,557
Please, listen to me.

991
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:27,401
I love you, Massimo.
But something terrible is happening.

992
01:29:27,839 --> 01:29:30,189
The Germans are taking everyone away.

993
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,970
Even the elderly and the
children, you understand?

994
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,718
And I'm here and I see it.
Massimo, I...

995
01:29:38,242 --> 01:29:39,773
I must go too.

996
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,580
I understand, Giulia,
I understand.

997
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:48,143
Now listen to me. Where are you?
Are you calling from the usual place?

998
01:29:48,465 --> 01:29:51,598
I.. I'm happy to hear your voice.

999
01:29:54,548 --> 01:29:58,693
But I want you to remain calm.
No, no...

1000
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:03,744
Try to understand, I..

1001
01:30:04,814 --> 01:30:06,399
I'll come back.

1002
01:30:07,248 --> 01:30:09,542
And if not, time will pass.

1003
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:16,999
You will be a man and have
much to do and live through.

1004
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:21,767
Leave...

1005
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:25,191
Leave a place for me in your memories.

1006
01:30:25,372 --> 01:30:27,914
We have to live together,
Giulia, Giulia!

1007
01:30:28,294 --> 01:30:30,194
But all the others, Massimo?

1008
01:30:30,771 --> 01:30:34,149
It's not only my father,
but all of my people.

1009
01:30:34,648 --> 01:30:36,048
Do you understand?

1010
01:30:36,957 --> 01:30:39,579
If now.. I were able to escape...

1011
01:30:41,622 --> 01:30:43,058
to come to you...

1012
01:30:43,775 --> 01:30:46,225
you would not love me as much any more.

1013
01:30:46,981 --> 01:30:49,131
I would not be Giulia any longer.

1014
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,833
Bye Massimo.

1015
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,315
Do not forget it, our October.

1016
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,670
Bye dear.

1017
01:31:00,704 --> 01:31:03,514
Bye.
Now I must go.

1018
01:31:03,905 --> 01:31:06,659
No, you can't go.
You can't go away, Giulia.

1019
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:11,556
We must stay alive! Giulia! Giulia!

1020
01:31:13,049 --> 01:31:16,469
Giulia!
Giulia!

1021
01:31:31,257 --> 01:31:32,308
Giulia!

1022
01:32:16,065 --> 01:32:19,853
The events depicted in this film are true.
