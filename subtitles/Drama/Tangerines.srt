1
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,965
Who are you?
- What?

2
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,420
Come out!

3
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:43,632
I'm asking, who are you?
- Me? Ivo. And who are you?

4
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,344
Are you alone here?
- Yes.

5
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,428
A Russian?
- No, Estonian.

6
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:01,592
What's an Estonian doing here?
- It's my factory.

7
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:08,377
What are the crates for? Bombs?

8
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:13,001
No. For tangerines.

9
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,711
Tangerines are good.

10
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,963
Ok. You have anything to eat?
We're hungry.

11
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:31,298
Food is in the house. There.
- Come, let's go.

12
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,878
Sit.

13
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:13,089
Who do you have at home?
- Nobody. I live alone.

14
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,758
Come in. Take your seats.

15
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,211
We'll sit, grandpa,

16
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:01,050
but better pack the food,
we'll take it with us. - Ok.

17
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,673
And don't be greedy.

18
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:23,047
See what a beautiful girl.
- Yeah, a beauty.

19
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,005
Where's your family?
You don't have anyone?

20
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,674
They all went home
when the war broke out.

21
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,917
Home where?
- To Estonia.

22
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,802
Why did you stay?

23
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,927
Didn't want to.

24
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,795
Your daughter?
- Granddaughter.

25
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:01,384
And don't comment. Don't dare.

26
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:08,469
Didn't mean to. Ibrahim!

27
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,253
What's this?

28
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,594
Food.

29
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,084
You are a good man, grandpa.
Shame that you're that old.

30
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,379
It's a pity that
brave men like you get old.

31
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:39,877
So what's going on there?
War's raging?

32
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,545
Yeah, man.
Go away to your Estonia.

33
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,086
Not everyone are nice guys
like us.

34
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:57,093
Does anyone live in these houses?
- No, they're all deserted.

35
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,299
Only in the one by a plantation,
there's one.

36
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,962
But he has nothing
but tangerines. I'm helping him.

37
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,378
We don't care about tangerines.

38
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,086
But you have a nice crate
business here. Good for you.

39
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,136
Margus!

40
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,420
Margus!

41
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,427
Yeah, wait a minute.

42
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:13,298
Who were they?
- Some Caucasians. Wanted to eat.

43
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,756
They didn't come to me.
- I know.

44
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,174
Listen, did you manage to agree?
- Yeah.

45
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,292
They promised to send
20 soldiers on the 7th. For one day.

46
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,257
Damn, one day's not enough.
- Clearly.

47
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:29,500
We'll pick as much as we can.
I'm already on it.

48
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:34,628
Good. If we wait too long, we won't
get a damn thing out of here.

49
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:38,171
In a few days it may be
pretty fierce up here.

50
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,132
Those two also said
it'll be war soon.

51
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,420
My major said the same.

52
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,087
If I make ten crates today,
we'll have 200. Enough?

53
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,505
I don't know. Look for yourself.
Some 50 more would be needed.

54
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,761
Alright.

55
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,713
Don't kill yourself with work,
it's five days till the 7th.

56
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,261
The sooner the better.

57
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,460
War news from the radio.

58
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,420
Margus!

59
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,345
Margus!
- Yeah.

60
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,090
You didn't get shot?
- No.

61
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,173
What happened?
- I don't know.

62
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:59,884
This one drove by first,
that one was chasing, shooting.

63
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:04,127
Hit the fence, damn,
it's all ruined now.

64
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,136
I was up the tree...
I mean, hid myself.

65
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:12,752
Then they shot from something,
bazooka, I guess.

66
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:20,424
Damn, it drives you crazy here.
What was it? - Calm down.

67
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:40,090
He's wounded. Go take a look
at the van. And be careful.

68
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:49,545
Easy, easy...

69
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,546
So how is it?
- All dead.

70
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:18,218
Well, Georgian dzhigits,
where are you? - Easy.

71
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:29,298
How is it there in the heavens,
sons of bitches? - Enough!

72
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,753
Don't shout, or you will die.

73
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,427
Barely managed
to stop the bleeding.

74
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,427
But Ibrahim was killed?
- Start the car.

75
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,632
The bastards killed him, right?
- Yes.

76
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,922
We'll go and bury him now,
but you try to calm down.

77
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:56,048
We'll get a doctor for you.
And try to move less.

78
00:14:56,208 --> 00:15:00,588
Be careful, grandpa,
look out for a tail.

79
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,504
The rest of the Georgians
may follow.

80
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,011
Don't worry, lie quietly.

81
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:12,424
Give me my gun.
- What for? No one will come here.

82
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,463
Give. Anything can happen.
- I told you, they won't come!

83
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:54,213
Check their pockets,
maybe you'll find some documents.

84
00:16:55,417 --> 00:17:00,298
What for?
- Their relatives may come looking.

85
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,961
We can take them
to their grave then.

86
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,802
You're right.

87
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:22,169
The Georgians are mere boys.
But that one isn't.

88
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,261
Yeah, mere boys.

89
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:33,923
You know what, let's bury
the Georgians together

90
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,299
and the bearded one
separately here.

91
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,713
Then we'll know who's where.
- Alright.

92
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,965
That Georgian is alive!

93
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,215
Don't worry, it's us.

94
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,880
Who's that? Ibrahim? Alive?
- No, it's not Ibrahim.

95
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,136
Who then?

96
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,176
Get some water and a clean towel
from the kitchen cupboard.

97
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,882
There's a shell fragment
in his head.

98
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,792
We need Juhan now,
otherwise he won't survive.

99
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,469
The other one
needs a doctor, too.

100
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:32,259
Get Juhan quickly
and we need to tow away the van.

101
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,175
It's easier with three of us.
- I've got a good cable.

102
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,844
Wait!

103
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,344
See that he won't tell anyone.

104
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,344
Who does he have to tell?
Everyone's gone.

105
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,128
His wife.
- She's already in Estonia.

106
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,173
How are you?

107
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,174
In pain?
- Not too bad.

108
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,340
Thanks to Allah, slightly less.

109
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,086
Who did you carry in?

110
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,844
A Georgian. Gravely wounded.

111
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,334
What? You out of your
fucking mind, grandpa?

112
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,629
I'll whack him anyway.
Wasted effort.

113
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,085
Alright, I apologise for that
word, but they killed my friend.

114
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,335
And you didn't kill two of his?
Or can't count?

115
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:03,792
Should have killed three.
Anyway, I will set that right.

116
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,542
No point in treating him.
No point.

117
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,299
How is he?
- The Chechen will heal in a week.

118
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:38,876
But the Georgian, I don't know.
Depends on his body.

119
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,965
What shall we do with the fragment?

120
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,542
See that he gets the shots
in time. - Don't worry.

121
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:58,751
Why is he raving all the time?
- Raving is good.

122
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,253
He may even survive.

123
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:04,840
I'll come back same time tomorrow.

124
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,137
Did he eat?
- Some. He's asleep now.

125
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:19,709
Shall we go?
- Wait. I'll lock the Georgian's door.

126
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:25,546
We don't know what the madman
may come up with.

127
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,631
Let's go! Grab the wheel.

128
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,833
Turn the wheel right! Right!

129
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,586
Very good!

130
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,340
Going, going...

131
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,045
I thought it would explode.

132
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,917
They explode in cinema.
- Cinema is a big fraud.

133
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:19,091
How's it going?
- Not bad.

134
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:24,508
Made 20 crates,
you can take them.

135
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,630
You know... These wounded men
will ruin our business.

136
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:38,087
So what shall I do now?
Kill them?

137
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:45,417
No, I didn't mean that.
Just saying. - Quit whining.

138
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:59,297
How much did you pick?
- Yesterday's crates are full.

139
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,092
Very good. Did you
drop by my house?

140
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,209
Yeah, I brought the key.
- Could have left it under the stairs.

141
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:12,334
What if someone finds it?
- Who's going to look for a key?

142
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,470
They'll take down the door
if they want to.

143
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,427
How are they?
- The Chechen is well.

144
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:24,962
Ate everything there was.
Seems to be recovering.

145
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,256
And the Georgian?

146
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:35,342
Did you measure his temperature?
- What for?

147
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,128
His head is all hot, raving all the time.

148
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:41,802
Leave the key.

149
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,091
Shall I help you
to carry the crates?

150
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,129
No need. I'll manage.
Do your own things.

151
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,300
Went to see the van. You can
barely spot it from the road.

152
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:13,844
What were you thinking?
- I'll whack him anyway, grandpa.

153
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:21,964
Lock him under a thousand locks,
I'll get revenge for my friend.

154
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:25,755
It's a holy thing for us,
you don't understand this.

155
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:31,136
To kill a sleeping man,

156
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:37,469
even if he's unconscious,
is a holy thing?

157
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,131
Didn't know, really.

158
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:46,091
Then I'll kill him
when he can stand again.

159
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:22,465
It's going to rain.

160
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,881
No, it will not.

161
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,507
They'll be here soon.
- They who?

162
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:38,592
Georgians. Or Russians.

163
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,132
And tangerines
will remain on trees.

164
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:48,170
You know what they call this war?

165
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,712
The Citrus War.
- Meaning?

166
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,879
Meaning who will get
my tangerines.

167
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,711
Come on.

168
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:05,509
They fight for the land.
- Where my tangerines grow.

169
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:12,092
You have gone out of your mind
with your tangerines.

170
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:18,506
As soon as the tangerines are sold,
I'll go to Estonia. It's free now.

171
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,545
The Georgian came to.

172
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,844
Thank you.

173
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,094
Thank you for everything.

174
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:59,177
Try not to speak much.

175
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:04,125
My head is aching very much.
- Don't worry.

176
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:07,216
I'll give you a shot
and it will be better.

177
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,719
Well, the bastard woke up?

178
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:15,336
Who's that?
- Don't mind, he's a lunatic.

179
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:28,043
I'll whack him anyway, grandpa.
- Listen to me!

180
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:32,634
No one can kill anyone in my house,
unless I want it to happen!

181
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:39,302
But if you think to do it anyway,
you'll have to kill me first.

182
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:45,261
Come on, grandpa. You saved me.
- You heard what I said.

183
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:53,175
Well, then. I give you my word
that I won't kill him in your house.

184
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:57,042
But as soon as he goes out,
I'll do my thing.

185
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,920
I will hope to see you in Estonia.

186
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:17,588
When will you leave?
- A car will come in the morning.

187
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,552
Be careful then.
- No big deal,

188
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:24,962
half an hour to the airport,
and on from there.

189
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,302
Godspeed.

190
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,586
What are you doing here?

191
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,253
Sell your tangerines
and come along.

192
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:38,005
The former life is gone.
That's it. The end.

193
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,128
You know very well
why I'm staying.

194
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,927
You better think of
your granddaughter.

195
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:49,633
Mari is well,
I don't worry about her.

196
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:54,588
Juhan. Thank you.

197
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:05,426
Medicines are in the closet,
I left the instructions there, too.

198
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,378
Take care.

199
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:18,799
Up already?
- I'm better. Can't lie anymore.

200
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,261
My clothes suit you.

201
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,219
Easy, easy!

202
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,465
You must eat a lot.

203
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:06,050
Recover your strength.
- I'm not hungry.

204
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,552
I'm telling you, eat!

205
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,927
Want SOl'T1€ tea?
- Yes.

206
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,423
Thank you for saving me.

207
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:34,667
You're welcome. Eat.

208
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,334
I apologise once more for
the bad word I said back then.

209
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,131
I'm nervous. But usually,
we honour old people. Very much.

210
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,628
Apology accepted.

211
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,633
Your wound is painful?
- Not much.

212
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,460
Where did you bury my friend?
- In the woods.

213
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,130
What's your name?
- Ahmed.

214
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:33,254
But you are not interested
in my name?

215
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:39,882
I am.
- I'm Ivo.

216
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:44,253
I'm a Chechen, a soldier.

217
00:35:46,667 --> 00:35:49,170
A mercenary?
- Yes.

218
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:55,011
Understood.

219
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:03,134
You have a family?
- Yes.

220
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:09,593
I went to war because of them.
I get paid well.

221
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:17,299
Went to war because of them?
- Don't start to moralise.

222
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,927
I told you that I honour
old people,

223
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:23,758
but it's none of your business.
None, Ivo.

224
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:27,592
Correct, I'm Ivo.

225
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:47,965
Ivo...

226
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,005
Where's my gun?
- In a safe place.

227
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:59,048
You get better, I'll give it back.
Even trophy guns of the Georgians.

228
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,302
These are yours, too, right?

229
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:17,090
I want to ask something.
- Ask then.

230
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,756
I have to tell you,
if I give my word of honour,

231
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:25,842
I rather die than break it.
- Right. I'm like that, too.

232
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,462
So I don't have to lock
that door anymore?

233
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,878
Listen, Ivo, you, an Estonian,

234
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,886
are rather dying
than breaking your word.

235
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:41,549
You are asking me, a Caucasian,
a mountaineer, if I keep mine?

236
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,802
For us, it means everything.

237
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:47,758
I promised not to kill
in your house, so I won't.

238
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,090
Very well.

239
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,676
But an Estonian or a Caucasian,
it does not make any difference.

240
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:05,345
Ivo, why didn't you leave
for Estonia?

241
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,710
But that is none
of your business, young man.

242
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:29,135
Our work is completely pointless,
if we won't get any help.

243
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:32,717
I have only picked two crates
during that time.

244
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,094
Can't pick any more.

245
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,005
If the help will not arrive
tomorrow, we are screwed.

246
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:43,136
What did the major
exactly tell you?

247
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:46,626
That they'll come
if something will not happen.

248
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:49,215
If something does not happen.

249
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:53,300
Unless they are stationed
somewhere else. They won't be.

250
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:56,792
They've been guarding the entrance
for two weeks.

251
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:59,427
Why should anything
happen tomorrow?

252
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,177
I don't know.

253
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,461
It sure would be strange

254
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:10,004
if soldiers would pick
tangerines in wartime.

255
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,712
You are strange.
The major promised.

256
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:23,005
Well, God help us. I hope, too.

257
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:28,292
Don't worry, Ivo.
They will come.

258
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,460
War news from the radio.

259
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,173
Easy, easy.

260
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,886
No hurry.

261
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:04,590
Good boy.

262
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,628
Sit down.

263
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:19,796
How are you feeling?
- Head is slightly spinning.

264
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,086
It's nothing.

265
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,048
We found this in your head.

266
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,382
And these in your pockets.

267
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,715
SOITIE tea?
- Yes.

268
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:16,009
Ahmed, drink up your tea.
It will cool down.

269
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:52,335
Ok then, enemies.
He's Ahmed, he's Nike.

270
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,504
Pleased to meet you.

271
00:41:55,667 --> 00:42:00,924
You know, Georgian, you may
know already, don't be afraid.

272
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,335
I have promised to our saviour
not to kill you in his house.

273
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,094
So if you want to live,
don't go out.

274
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:18,584
Don't even extend your head out,
as I will chop it off at once.

275
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:30,006
But can he pee out the window?

276
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,677
Enough!

277
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:44,011
Enough.

278
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,378
I'm sorry, Ivo.

279
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,219
So they didn't come?

280
00:43:57,958 --> 00:44:00,131
Some tea?

281
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:06,216
Well, don't worry
about the tangerines.

282
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:10,585
It's idiotic anyway to start a
tangerine business in wartime.

283
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:28,302
He doesn't happen to be
your relative?

284
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,719
Margus!

285
00:44:58,292 --> 00:45:00,886
Come in, why are you
standing there?

286
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:05,627
I don't know,
I thought you got mad at me.

287
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,427
Forget it. Come in.

288
00:45:13,292 --> 00:45:16,011
Let's sit outside.
The weather is fair.

289
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:21,049
I don't want to leave them
alone for too long.

290
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:59,587
You are not afraid
they will kill each other?

291
00:46:02,542 --> 00:46:04,795
The Chechen gave his word.

292
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:09,007
And you believe him?
- I do.

293
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,380
But the Georgian?
- He, too.

294
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,136
Well, since you have their word...

295
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:28,173
Don't be surprised, there are
people worth their word.

296
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:36,128
And both of them in your house?
- Leave it alone.

297
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:43,541
Maybe you want to send
one over to my place?

298
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:49,887
No, the skirmish took place
at your gate.

299
00:46:50,042 --> 00:46:52,170
They broke your fence.

300
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:57,968
You can see the van from
your house, and so on.

301
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:06,423
No, it's safer at my place.
- Yes, quite.

302
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:12,173
Come to my place this evening.

303
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:18,386
The boys will retire early,
let's get a drink. - Agreed.

304
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:23,256
So, this evening?

305
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:30,213
Don't get mad at me, but maybe
you'll come to Estonia with me?

306
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:36,552
Ivo, maybe we could find
another melody? It drives me crazy.

307
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:40,420
But I like it. I'm listening.

308
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:14,591
But what sort of music
do you like, Georgian?

309
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:21,088
I don't like this one.
- Georgian music?

310
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:31,168
I like Georgian music.
- And Georgian land, too?

311
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:35,258
Where's the Georgian land?
- Here.

312
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:38,626
The one you are sitting on,
is Georgian land.

313
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:41,841
You're sitting on Georgian land.
- No.

314
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,630
I'm sitting on an Estonian chair.
- Very funny.

315
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:49,751
Yes, on an Estonian chair
standing in an Estonian house

316
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:52,420
that's standing on
an Abkhazian land.

317
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:57,293
Listen, did you go to school
at all? Do you have schools?

318
00:49:57,458 --> 00:50:00,667
What?
- I'm asking if you have schools.

319
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:07,214
What are you smirking at, alien.
What have you lost here in Georgia?

320
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:11,881
I'm here to protect a tiny nation
from evil aliens like you!

321
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:15,421
It seems that you really
don't have schools there.

322
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:19,042
You don't understand a thing.
Don't know a thing.

323
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:22,883
Didn't study any history?
Haven't read any books?

324
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,506
I'm not going to be offended by you,
I don't care what you're blabbering.

325
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:32,420
You are safe here,
blabber all you want.

326
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:36,292
Ok, let's go outside right now!
- You can't even walk!

327
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:40,133
I could kill you with a rag.
Wouldn't be too manly.

328
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:43,876
Recover first, then we'll see
what'll be left of you.

329
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,670
You son of a bitch!

330
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,460
Don't brag if you're not
good for it! Fucking maggot!

331
00:50:56,958 --> 00:51:02,089
Get lost from my country, cunt!
- I'm telling you, idiot,

332
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,344
it's not Georgian land!

333
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,926
Go ahead, sleep. You don't have
much time left. - Enough, Ahmed!

334
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:16,171
Sorry, Ivo, but will you tell him
to shut up, too?

335
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:18,461
You will shut up soon!

336
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:25,886
Quiet...

337
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:14,629
Good morning, Ivo!
- Hello.

338
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:18,672
How are you?
- Recovering.

339
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:21,336
That's good

340
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:27,086
And where's
your enemy? Still sleeping?

341
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,333
No, the enemy's not sleeping.
Good morning.

342
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:33,753
How's your head?
- Pain is almost gone.

343
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,796
While standing.
It's difficult to lie.

344
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:41,088
But you can take an example
from a horse. Sleep on your feet.

345
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,300
Am I talking to you?
- Do horses talk at all?

346
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:49,959
Some humour.
Suits your intelligence well.

347
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,094
Ok, I'll behave.

348
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:12,508
SOITIE tea?
- Yes.

349
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:15,386
Shall I pour you, bro?

350
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,049
On your head?
- You don't want to try.

351
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,128
Again.

352
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:38,802
Thank you.

353
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:15,885
Ivo, is this your daughter?

354
00:54:16,042 --> 00:54:18,545
No, his granddaughter.

355
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:26,003
What's her name?

356
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:33,758
None of your business.
- There are cars approaching.

357
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:51,511
Ahmed, they are Abkhazians.

358
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:54,295
If they enter,
will you give him away?

359
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:58,167
No, I have to kill him myself.
- Good.

360
00:54:58,333 --> 00:55:02,759
Then we tell them he's Ibrahim.
and you killed all the Georgians.

361
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:05,887
You're not asking me?
Ivo, give me my gun!

362
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:12,136
Quit your foolish talk.

363
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:16,718
You can't talk, because you
caught it to your head. That's it.

364
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:21,170
You know why
you have to be silent?

365
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:24,086
Because first, they will shoot me.

366
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:28,710
Even if I curse Georgians,
you will stay quiet.

367
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:34,626
So, he can't talk
after getting wounded.

368
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:43,048
Hello, Ivo.
- Hello, Aslan.

369
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:46,469
Listen, we saw
a Georgian van

370
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:50,084
over there in a chasm
near Margus' plantation.

371
00:55:51,667 --> 00:55:54,295
And there is a car
here at your place.

372
00:55:54,458 --> 00:55:56,711
Oh, Margus. You're here.

373
00:55:56,875 --> 00:56:01,210
So what happened?
Where are the Georgians?

374
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:07,962
All killed. Chechens wasted them.
But we saved two Chechens.

375
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,880
They are here, wounded.
- In your house?

376
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:17,756
Come in, I'll introduce you.
- Right, I'd like to shake hands.

377
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,045
Come in.

378
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:27,177
Here you are.

379
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:31,292
Sit, don't get up, brother,
you're wounded. - I'll live.

380
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:33,586
Aslan.
- Ahmed.

381
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,710
Aslan.

382
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:51,377
He's Ibrahim, but he can't talk,
was wounded to his head.

383
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:55,843
Well, I'll be... Fuck 'em.

384
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:01,672
How is it? Got hurt
and tongue isn't working?

385
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:07,550
Stupid. A brick fell
on my neighbour's head,

386
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,177
and his legs stopped moving.

387
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:14,884
There are spots in your head
that move all parts of your body.

388
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:20,344
Like here, maybe, is a leg spot,
and here, one for hands. Get it?

389
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,583
He didn't get a damn thing!

390
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:31,712
I have good vodka. Sit down.
- No, Ivo, we're off to the front.

391
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,969
They say it's
total mayhem there.

392
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:39,130
And what will happen?
- We'll flush the fuckers away.

393
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:43,968
You doubt it?
- No, Aslan, of course not.

394
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:47,129
These guys are helping.

395
00:57:47,292 --> 00:57:50,751
How many Georgians were there?
- Three.

396
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:55,343
They saw us on the road
and started to shoot.

397
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,094
We turned around, they followed.

398
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:03,300
Then Ibrahim caught a bullet
to his head, we rammed a fence

399
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:05,631
and drove into the plantation.

400
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:11,925
I managed to hit the bull's-eye
with a bazooka. - Well done, Ahmed.

401
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:17,294
The bodies are in the van?
- No. We buried them in the woods.

402
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:24,135
Throwing them out on a road like dogs
would have been right for them.

403
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:27,592
Aslan, they're humans
as well, very young ones.

404
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,844
Well, let it be.

405
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,257
You get well. Most important is
that he could talk again.

406
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:38,751
As soon as we feel strong enough,
we'll join you.

407
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:41,090
Thanks, Ahmed, we're brothers.

408
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:52,881
Aslan...

409
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:00,548
Do something good.

410
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:02,881
I know it's a bad time,

411
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:06,797
but Margus is about to lose
a huge crop of tangerines.

412
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:10,417
A major here promised
to send people, but couldn't.

413
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:15,214
Maybe you can help.
We'll share the money afterwards.

414
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:19,960
How many people do you need?
- 30 maybe, 40 would be better.

415
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:23,925
No problem. Day after tomorrow
the people will be here.

416
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:27,383
We'll stay by the river
for three days.

417
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:33,128
And money is not needed,
a few crates of tangerines will do.

418
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:38,045
Thank you, Aslan.
We'll be waiting.

419
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,052
Day after tomorrow.
I give you my word.

420
00:59:59,917 --> 01:00:04,343
Look, Ahmed, the Georgian
is outside. Want to kill?

421
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:08,636
Won't bother to kill him today,
somehow.

422
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:14,718
Margus! Aslan promised to send
40 men day after tomorrow!

423
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,128
This is very good.

424
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:31,633
Coals only, Margus. No flame.
- I know!

425
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:42,003
Are you cold? Want a jacket?
- No, thanks, Ivo, I'm not.

426
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:49,043
What are you planning to do
when you recover? Back to war?

427
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,711
You don't know?
- I do.

428
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:57,003
So, everything's ready.

429
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:04,548
Try it and tell me, have you had
anything like this before?

430
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,048
We'll try.

431
01:01:08,208 --> 01:01:11,508
You have never eaten it?
- Try first, then talk.

432
01:01:13,292 --> 01:01:15,590
Delicious.

433
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,799
You, Georgians,
can't make shashlik.

434
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:23,584
You think you can,
as well as everything else.

435
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:28,713
Everything else?
What is it then we can't do?

436
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:33,091
Many things.
- Well, for example?

437
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:40,886
For example, you can't fight.
At all.

438
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:48,172
Laugh all you want.
You can't, but are still fighting.

439
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:51,507
And lose every time.
Now this is really funny.

440
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:56,673
That's a lot of crap!
I'm telling you, you are uneducated.

441
01:01:56,833 --> 01:02:00,918
You know nothing about history.
- It doesn't change a thing.

442
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,508
Can't make shashlik, can't fight.
It's a fact.

443
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,840
I'll show you what I can do.

444
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,344
Go ahead,
kill me as you promised.

445
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,709
We're not in the house.
Go ahead, try.

446
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:17,843
You'll see what a Georgian
is capable of! Let's go!

447
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,378
Alright. Let's see.

448
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:28,177
Calm down!

449
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:31,670
Sit down.

450
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,170
Sit!

451
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:41,552
Enough of that.

452
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,917
Or I swear, I saved you both
and will kill as well.

453
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:57,802
What is it with you, guys?
Kill you, kill you...

454
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:04,136
Who gave you that right?

455
01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:09,387
Who?
- The war.

456
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:13,927
Moron!

457
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,470
Shall I pour you?
- Go ahead.

458
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:26,927
Not for you, yet. You're sick.
Well, symbolically.

459
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:30,466
I don't drink at all,
don't pour me any.

460
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:42,170
What shall we drink to?
- To death!

461
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:47,423
Go ahead, Margus.

462
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:52,086
I can't drink to death.

463
01:03:53,458 --> 01:03:58,794
Why? It's their very mother.

464
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:04,423
They are the children of death.

465
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:11,715
I'm sorry, Ivo. It will not
happen again, by Allah's name.

466
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:18,173
What does it matter where you will
kill each other, here or there.

467
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:22,008
You recover, go back to the front
and kill there.

468
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:29,126
It's silly to make you sit
at the same table.

469
01:04:33,042 --> 01:04:39,004
I'll drink to life.
- No. To death.

470
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:43,590
I proposed a toast to death!

471
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:12,836
Margus?
- Yes.

472
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,844
Did you solve your
tangerine problem?

473
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:23,880
Eh, I'm probably annoying you all
with my tangerines. - Not at all.

474
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:30,300
You see, it's not about money,
although it's big money.

475
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:34,964
It's just that a beautiful crop
will perish... A pity.

476
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:41,963
Well, we can help you.
- Yes.

477
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:45,095
Come on, I have
plenty of helpers anyway.

478
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:50,542
Let's check on Ivo,
he probably felt offended.

479
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:54,167
Ivo's not offended,
Ivo's pissing.

480
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,969
They probably bombed Aslan
by the river.

481
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,961
Perhaps you'd eat something.

482
01:08:00,917 --> 01:08:03,045
Good morning!
- Morning.

483
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:23,552
Hello, Ivo.
- Hello.

484
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:57,384
I'd like to give you some money,
for going back to Estonia.

485
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:05,169
What are you talking about?
I can't take that sort of money.

486
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:10,009
What sort?
- That sort.

487
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:13,961
But I'm a mercenary, it's my pay.

488
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:53,961
We honour the Christian religion.
- We honour other religions, too.

489
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:57,880
But why are you suddenly talking
about religion anyway?

490
01:09:58,042 --> 01:10:00,136
No reason.

491
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:17,299
Who were the other Georgians
for you?

492
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:22,011
Why are you asking?
- I'm curious.

493
01:10:23,792 --> 01:10:29,299
Not very close friends. We met
here. But they were good guys.

494
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:38,758
Ibrahim was like a brother to me.
We grew up together. - I'm sorry.

495
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:46,752
We need some firewood. I'll bring.
- Sit, let me.

496
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:50,342
No, I'll go and take
a little walk, too.

497
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:04,547
I'm sorry, too, that your
copatriots were killed. Good guys.

498
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,709
Could have taken it,
he meant it from his heart.

499
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:40,211
I'll go help him.

500
01:11:52,292 --> 01:11:55,171
Let me help.
- No, I need exercise.

501
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:21,301
You're looking at the picture
of my granddaughter awfully often.

502
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:24,712
Why?
- I'm not. You're wrong.

503
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,382
No, you are looking.
- Frankly, she's very pretty.

504
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:38,796
I don't seem to be able
to keep my eyes off her.

505
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:41,256
Sorry, Ivo.

506
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:47,345
She's even prettier in person.
Her name is Mari.

507
01:12:50,958 --> 01:12:53,052
She means everything to me.

508
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,960
Mari lives in Estonia?
- She used to live in this house.

509
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:04,710
She left with the others,
when war broke out here.

510
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:09,756
Why didn't you leave?
Hard to fare this place well?

511
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:12,090
You love it here?

512
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:18,381
I love it. And hate.

513
01:13:22,542 --> 01:13:26,376
Do you have a family?
- Just my mother.

514
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:29,045
My father died ten years ago.

515
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:31,586
Brothers, sisters?
- No, I'm alone.

516
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,961
And what were you doing
in peacetime?

517
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,584
I'm an actor. I play in a theatre.
- Seriously?

518
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:44,927
In cinema, too?
- Rarely.

519
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:49,213
They almost don't make films
over here anymore, no money.

520
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:56,042
And then decided to go to war.
- Yes. Felt obliged to and went.

521
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:58,381
Didn't even tell my mother.

522
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:06,961
When the war is over,
I'll come back to Tbilisi

523
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:13,667
to see you acting. And then we'll
sit down and remember these days.

524
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:21,169
And remember Ahmed.
- No, Ahmed will be there with me.

525
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,215
And will clap for you.

526
01:14:49,417 --> 01:14:52,500
Come here! You!

527
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:56,378
Don't show yourself! Sit quietly!

528
01:14:56,542 --> 01:15:00,092
Where are the guns?
- There, under the bed.

529
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,423
But don't touch them.

530
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:08,634
What are you fucking smirking at?
Georgian? - I'm not Georgian.

531
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:11,136
Sure?
- He's yours, guys.

532
01:15:13,042 --> 01:15:17,468
Stay there, old man!
- I'm a Chechen.

533
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:22,176
Then say something in Chechen!
- I'm a Chechen.

534
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:28,419
Came to fight on your side,
was wounded and he cured me.

535
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:33,214
Comrade officer,
I know your major. - Quiet!

536
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:38,508
Are you an idiot or what?
Say something in Chechen!

537
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:41,927
Say something, motherfucker!

538
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,677
And what does that mean?

539
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:50,052
No, he's Georgian alright.

540
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:54,167
You're deaf or what?
- It's 'motherfucker' in Chechen.

541
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,754
Fucking shoot him!
- Don't, he is yours!

542
01:15:58,917 --> 01:16:01,215
I said, quiet!
Execute my command!

543
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:03,753
Captain, maybe he is ours?
- Don't!

544
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,094
Nika, throw me a gun!

545
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:47,052
Cover me!

546
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:08,386
That's it, Nika, that's it!
They're dead.

547
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:22,836
Margus!

548
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:52,302
Motherfucker...

549
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:04,132
Finished?
- Yes.

550
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:08,586
There's only this cross of yours.

551
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:14,052
Like this?
- Yeah.

552
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,631
And Nika?
- We'll bury him elsewhere.

553
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:27,926
Where?
- Beside my son.

554
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:44,842
What did he die of?
- Was killed when the war broke.

555
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,879
By whom?
- God knows.

556
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:54,128
He went to the war at once.
To protect our land, he said.

557
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:58,006
I tried to talk him out of it,

558
01:20:58,167 --> 01:21:02,627
explained that it's nobody's war,
but he wouldn't listen.

559
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:08,506
So the Georgians killed him.
- Yes.

560
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:13,459
But what difference does it make?
- How's that?

561
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:17,670
You buried a Georgian
next to your son.

562
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,969
Ahmed, does it make
any difference?

563
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:30,970
Answer me!
- It doesn't.

564
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:44,631
So, going straight home?
-I miss my family.

565
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:50,378
Ivo, tell me...

566
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:53,546
If it would have been me killed,
not Nike,

567
01:21:53,708 --> 01:22:00,501
would you have buried me
beside your son, too? - Yes.

568
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,344
A bit farther away though.

569
01:22:12,167 --> 01:22:14,795
I really don't know
how to thank you.

570
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:19,006
Go! I don't like farewells.
