pelvic exams after the third month.

again for the test results.

give them to her. She's all clear.

by the district attorney's office.

125

The scandal began last week when one
of Mott's pregnant patients...

went to the state medical
board claiming...

by the doctor during an examination.

four more women have come forward...

alleging that they, too,
had been sexually molested.

...against the late
Victor Mott's estate.

the greenhouse,

- I'm in charge of the strawberries.
- Really?

314
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:29,025
- That sounds like a very important job.
- It is.

[ Whispering ]
She seems terrific. What's the catch?

316
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:40,728
There is no catch.
I think she's great.

317
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,002
I don't think she'll be a nanny
forever, but we can get her
to commit for a year.

318

00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,122
- Mommy's earring.
- It must have fallen out
when I was holding him.

He's okay.

324

I'm sorry
I frightened everybody.

Oh, that's
very pretty.

They say a wind chime
helps a baby sleep.

Why don't we get
you settled downstairs,

333

- then we'll hang it up
outside the nursery.
- Okay.

334
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,512
This is a little bit dark,
but your room gets more light.

This is...
the laundry room.

Who are the martins?

They're large swallows.

The same family comes back

I would come back too.

That is a beautiful
bracelet, Claire.

You like that?
I got that at an antique show.

- You can borrow it anytime.
- Well, thank you.

This must be
a special occasion.

I always feel sexy and glamorous
when I wear this dress.

a secret is, Emma?

They've known your mom and dad
a long time, huh?

Aunt Marlene grew up
with daddy.

They used to be boyfriend

He said that to you?

I'm serious!
There's too much pressure.

rip your fucking head off!

468
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,366
Ow!

469
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,994
I get it, ma'am.
Let me go!

470
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,573
Don't forget it.

471
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:35,169
[ Girl ]
Awesome! Wow, that was cool.

472
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,407
Ha-ha ha-ha-ha.

473
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,183
Secret club.

474
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,657
Good morning.

475
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,733
What's the matter?

476
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,308
You're not hungry,
sweetheart?

477
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,377
Shh-shh-shh.

478
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,537
Claire, I thought...

479
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,046
maybe you could use
a cup of coffee.

480
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,777
Oh, thanks.

481
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,910
- Peyton?
- Yeah?

482
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,717
Have you noticed anything
different about Joe?

483
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,225
No, I haven't.
Why, is something wrong?

484
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,196
No. I was just wondering.

485
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,699
I'm real tired. Michael was up all
night finishing his E.P.A. proposal.

486
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,929
- I got up at 4:30 to help him type it.
- I hope it works out.

487
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,005
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

488
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,199
- See you tonight.
- You're not gonna have pancakes?

489
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,971
Nah, I've got to go to Federal Express
before I go to the lab.

490
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,309
Let me. That's the last thing
you need to worry about.

491
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,282
You have the time?
My proposal has to go out today.

492
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,013
Okay. Thanks.
I love you.

493
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,248
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Michael.

494
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,794
[ Peyton ] How long have you
been volunteering here?

495
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,963
Gee, about seven years.

496
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:13,032
These days, I mainly take care
of the morning maintenance.

497
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,747
- Hi, Claire.
- Hi, Stan.

498
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,476
Kinda like a big
botanist family here,

499
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:24,019
- right, Stan?
- Y ep.

500
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,613
We sit around talking
about root rot,

501
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:32,185
drainage properties of shredded bark
and other topics like that.

502
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,699
[ Peyton ] Is your greenhouse gonna be
something like this one?

503
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:44,240
Oh, well, hopefully.
On a much smaller scale.

504
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,310
I've always loved
growing anything.

505
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:50,676
When I was little,
my parents thought I was crazy.

506
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,076
They thought I should've
been born on a farm.

507
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,214
[ Cooing ]

508
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,790
Hey!

509
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:05,089
Ohh!
Hello.

510
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,130
Hello!

511
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:13,134
Do you have relatives
in Seattle?

512
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,467
Oh no.
No, I don't.

513
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,440
My husband
was my only family.

514
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:23,002
He's the only one who ever...
really understood me.

515
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,207
He took care of me.

516
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,781
He was murdered.

517
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:35,120
Murdered?

518
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,295
They never caught
who did it.

519
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:44,299
But I firmly believe...

520
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,892
what goes around,
comes around.

521
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,906
Is there a
bathroom here?

522
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:58,038
- Yeah, down through there
on the right side.
- I'll be right back.

523
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,073
Come here,
little one.

524
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,084
Do you need
to be changed?

525
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:57,964
[ Wheezing ]

526
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,905
[ Wheezing ]

00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,843
Come here.

528
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:15,749
[ Wheezing ]
Michael's proposal. I can't find it.

529
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,651
It was in your purse.
I saw you put it in there!

530
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:25,461
- Claire, are you all right?
- Asthma. I'll be okay.

531
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,569
Asthma.

532
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,344
Michael, it...
just disappeared.

533
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:52,751
I retraced my steps. I spoke to
the manager in the restaurant.

534
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,586
He said he'd call
in the morning.

535
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,093
What did they say
when you called again?

536
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,663
They said they'd
consider it next quarter.

537
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,756
- But they said they'd consider it?
- Claire, come on.

538
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,358
We've been over this.

539
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,463
Look, everything
is gonna be okay.

540
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,701
- Michael, I'm so sorry.
- I know you are, honey.

541
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,903
I know you are.

542
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:19,244
Maybe I left it
at the botanicals.

543
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,011
I'm going to
get back to work.

544
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,220
I'm sorry.

545

[ Crying ]

546
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:50,540
- Michael, I'm worried about Joe.
- Why, what's wrong?

547
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:54,549
Well, it's
his eating habits.

548
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,347
He's not nursing
the way he used to.

549
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,888
How long has this
been going on?

550
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,687
- It's not all the time,
but... a couple of weeks.
- Did you call the doctor?

551
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,819
- Y eah.
- What'd she say?

552
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,626
She said it's fine as long
as he keeps gaining weight.

553
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:13,362
- Well... I'm sure he's fine, honey.
- Okay.

554
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,465
Someone named Peyton
is here to see you.

555
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,544
- Peyton's here?
- She's waiting in your office.

556
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,446
She's our nanny,
Gilbert.

557
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,609
Uh-huh. Okay.

you do your hiring.

Shh!
He's out cold.

561
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,853
I'm sorry to bother you
here at the office,

562
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,933
- but I just wanted
to talk to you in private.
- Everything all right?

563
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:47,969
Oh, yeah. Everything's okay.
I just had an idea.

564
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,505
It's Claire's birthday
coming up.

565
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,508
I thought maybe it would be nice
to throw her a surprise party.

566
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,771
She's been feeling
kinda low lately,

567
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,081
- especially with this thing
with your proposal.
- That's a good idea.

568
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,912
- especially with this thing
with your proposal.
- That's a good idea.

569
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,951
- Y eah?
- Y eah.

570
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,214
Oh... do you think,

571
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,222
do you think Marlene
would want to help out?

572
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:11,351
Help out? You kidding me?
She'll take over.

573
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,630
Well, maybe it's best not
to tell her it's my idea.

574
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,325
Why not?

575
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,995
I wouldn't want her to
think I was competitive.

576
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:24,164
You know?
About Claire's friendship.

577
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,573
You understand Marlene
pretty well already.

00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:39,082
Well, good...
so I'll be going.

Is... that the head?

Or is
that the foot?

No, that's part
of the fur.

Okay, I see.

That's a piece
of art.

No.

Did you like
looking at me?

601
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:01,496
Did you like...
Iooking at me?

Don't fuck with me,

will be...

00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,872
better than yours.

00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:29,257
I won't let
you hurt them.

606

It's for you,

him the bicycle. Emma just adores him.

that's been bothering me.

I feel a little awkward
bringing it up.

622

I've been noticing
some behavior that...

623
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,955
I feel might be
inappropriate.

I'm sorry. What
do you mean, inappropriate?

00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,726
Something about the way
he touches her.

626
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,567
I'm sure you
must've misunderstood.

627
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:28,676
You're right, Solomon would
never do anything like that.

628
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:31,804
Besides, it would be obvious
if Emma were keeping a secret.

629
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:38,452
- I'm sorry.
- Oh no, please. It's okay.

630
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,793
[ Solomon ]
She's coming around.

631
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:49,764
Whoa! Whoa!

632
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,360
I love you very much,
sweetheart.

633
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,406
You know that
if anything happened,

634
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,566
good or bad,

635
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,474
you can tell me and l
would love you just as much.

636
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,740
Do you know that?

637
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,247
Yes.

638
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,750
We shouldn't have
any secrets, Emma.

639
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:15,382
Secrets between people who
love each other aren't good.

640
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,528
What's the matter,
baby?

641
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,756
Nothing.

642
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,032
You don't have to say.

643
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,049
Why can't I see
through this glass?

644
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,750
It's fiberglass,
a different kind of glass.

645
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:53,227
We put real glass in the ceiling
to let the sunlight through.

646
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:00,935
And this lets the air in so it
doesn't get too hot in the greenhouse.

647
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,773
Claire, Joe's intercom
conked out.

648
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:08,071
I couldn't find any
batteries in the kitchen.

649
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:12,615
- Do you think Solomon's
got some in his cart?
- Well...

650
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:16,516
he's got everything else there.
Let me take a look.

651
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,164
Do you see
what you've done?

652
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,427
[ Wheezing ]

653
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,722
[ Claire ]
Sweetheart?

654
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:07,888
Come away from
the window, honey.

655
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,897
Emma?

656
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,130
Come sit down.

657
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,153
Peyton.

658
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:37,352
[ Crying ]

659
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,928
But I don't
understand.

660
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,729
Why did they take
Solomon away?

661
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:49,805
I guess your mommy didn't
like Solomon very much.

662
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:54,605
I wanted to help Solomon, but I was
afraid she'd try to send me away too.

663
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:58,078
I hate her.

664
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:01,480
I bet your mommy
wasn't mean like mine.

665
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:05,179
I didn't have
a mommy.

666
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:08,519
She died when
I was very little.

667
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,617
Your mommy died?

668
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,196
Then who took care
of you?

669
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,400
I had to take care
of myself.

670
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:24,337
Peyton, if something
happens to my mommy,

671
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,875
would you
take care of me?

672
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,774
Of course I would.

673
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,347
And your daddy too.

674
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,474
I'd take care
of all of you.

675
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,429
- Last of the boxes.
- Yeah.

676
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,108
[ Sigh ]

677
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:08,444
Emma's gonna be okay,
Claire.

678
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:20,393
But she's so different
around me lately.

679
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,557
She's not
my little girl.

680
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,635
She's so angry...

681
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:29,034
and guarded.

682
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:32,574
I think...

683
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:36,475
maybe she blames me
because I didn't protect her.

684
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:40,071
I don't think so,
Claire.

685
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,429
Shh.

686
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,161
Marlene wants to get together tonight
to make out a guest list.

687
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,601
I'm not sure this party
is a good idea now.

688
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,797
- What do you think?
- I think we should go ahead with it.

689
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:06,637
Everyone could use
some cheering up,

690
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:10,611
especially Claire. You know how
she's been blaming herself.

691
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,774
Y eah, I think
you're right.

692
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,852
Guess I just
needed to hear it.

693
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:21,550
[ Cooing ]

694
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,592
[ Marlene ]
Thanks for lunch.

695
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:25,718
I especially liked the part where
we picked up the fertilizer.

696
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,853
- Oh, you liked that?
- Oh, yeah.

697
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,228
[ Peyton ]
Hi, you two.

698
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,597
- Hi. Oh, can I take him?
- Oh, sure.

699
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:37,401
- Hi, sweetheart. Hello.
- [ Crying ]

700
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,474
- Let me help.
- He's getting so big.

701
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,636
- [ Crying ]
- He's like a different kid
every time I see him.

702
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,212
[ Crying ]
