1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,877
School finally ended
and summer came...

2
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:11,303
and so did Dill.

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,901
- Good mornin'.
- Good mornin'. My, you're up...

4
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:16,533
mighty bright and early.

5
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:18,374
Ooh, I been up since 4:00.

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:22,432
- 4:00 ?
- Oh, yes, I always get up at 4:00.

7
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:24,398
It's in my blood.

8
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,955
My daddy was a railroad man
'til he got rich.

9
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:29,546
Now he flies airplanes.

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,135
One of these days,

11
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:33,268
he's just gonna swoop
down here at Maycomb,

12
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:35,655
pick me up and take me
for a ride.

13
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:47,328
Who's that in the car
with Sheriff Tate ?

14
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:50,173
Tom Robinson, son.

15
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:52,139
Where's he been ?

16
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,529
In the Abbottsville jail.

17
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:59,587
- Why ?
- The sheriff thought
he'd be safer there.

18
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:02,265
They're bringin' him
back here tonight...

19
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:04,608
because his trial
is tomorrow.

20
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:25,528
- Well, good evenin', Heck.
- Good evenin', Mr. Finch.

21
00:01:26,658 --> 00:01:28,624
Come in.

22
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:37,745
The news has gotten around
the county about my bringin'
Tom Robinson back to the jail.

23
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:42,599
I, uh, heard there might be trouble
from that bunch out at Old Sarum.

24
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:55,696
Cal, if I need you to stay here tonight,
can you do it ?

25
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:58,288
- Yes, sir, I can.
- Thank you.

26
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:07,076
I think you better
count on stayin'.

27
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:09,712
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:47,076
- What's goin' on ?
- Shh. Go back to sleep.

29
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:50,547
- What's goin' on ?
- Shh.

30
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:01,677
Hey, there's his car.

31
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:16,993
There he is over there.

32
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:23,727
No, Scout, don't go to him.
He might not like it.

33
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:29,376
I just wanted to see where he was
and what he was up to.

34
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,845
He's all right.
Let's go back home.

35
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,894
Come on.

36
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:35,945
- He in there, Mr. Finch ?
- He is.

37
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:39,543
He's asleep.
Don't wake him.

38
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:42,388
You know what we want.

39
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:47,451
Get aside from that door,
Mr. Finch.

40
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:51,594
Walter...

41
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:57,074
I think you oughta turn
right around and go back home.

42
00:04:57,074 --> 00:05:00,966
- Heck Tate's around here somewhere.
- No, he ain't !

43
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:04,186
Heck and his bunch is out in Old Sarum,
lookin' for us.

44
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:06,698
We knowed he was,
so we come in this other way.

45
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,671
- You ain't thought
about that, had you, Mr. Finch ?
- I thought about it.

46
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:15,651
- I can't see Atticus.
Well, that changes things some.

47
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:19,208
Atticus.

48
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:24,020
- Hey, Atticus.
- Jem, go home.

49
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:28,287
Take Scout and Dill
home with you.

50
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,844
- Son, I said go home.
- No, sir.

51
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:36,028
- I'll send him home.
- Don't you touch him !

52
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,161
Let him go !
Let him go !

53
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:40,212
That'll do, Scout.

54
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:46,153
Ain't nobody gonna
do Jem that way !

55
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,334
You get 'em out of here,
Mr. Finch.

56
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:57,158
Jem, I want you to please leave.

57
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,543
- No, sir. - Jem !

58
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:02,930
I tell you, I ain't goin'.

59
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:04,897
Hey, Mr. Cunningham.

60
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:12,888
I said, "Hey, Mr. Cunningham."
How's your entailment gettin' along ?

61
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:18,747
Don't you remember me,
Mr. Cunningham ?

62
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:23,642
I'm Jean Louise Finch.

63
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:27,868
You brought us some hickory nuts
one morning. Remember ?

64
00:06:27,994 --> 00:06:31,175
We had a talk.

65
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,698
I went and got my daddy
to come out and thank you.

66
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:39,239
I go to school with your boy.
I go to school with Walter.

67
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:41,532
He's a nice boy.

68
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:44,076
Tell him "hey" for me,
won't you ?

69
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,247
You know somethin',
Mr. Cunningham ?

70
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:49,332
Entailments are bad.

71
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:52,668
- Entailments

72
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:03,886
Atticus, I was just sayin'
to Mr. Cunningham
that entailments were bad,

73
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,140
but not to worry.

74
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:08,810
It takes a long time sometimes.

75
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,478
What's the matter ?

76
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:24,324
I sure meant no harm,
Mr. Cunningham.

77
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:31,249
No harm taken, young lady.

78
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,835
I'll tell Walter
you said, "Hey."

79
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:39,173
Let's clear outta here.

80
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:43,469
Let's go, boys.

81
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:11,162
- Now you can go home.

82
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:13,707
All of you.

83
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,041
I'll be there later.

84
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,087
Come on.

85
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:22,090
Come on.

86
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:51,494
Mr. Finch, are they gone ?

87
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:55,916
They've gone.
They won't bother you anymore.

88
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:18,187
'Morning, Mr. Strikes.

89
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,022
- How do you do ?
- Ever seen so many people ?

90
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:23,567
Just like on Saturday.

91
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:27,320
Where you goin' ?

92
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:30,907
I can't stand it any longer.
I'm goin' to the courthouse and watch.

93
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:34,703
- You better not.
You know what Atticus said.
- I don't care if he did.

94
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:38,540
I'm not gonna miss
the most exciting thing that
ever happened in this town.

95
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:01,980
It's packed solid.
They're standin' all along the back.

96
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:06,067
- Reverend. - Yes ?

97
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:10,280
- Reverend Sykes,
are you going upstairs ?
- Yes, I am.

98
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,375
- Thank you, Brother John,
for holding my seat.
- That's okay, Reverend.

99
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,670
Come on, children.
Come on, come on.

100
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:03,332
This court's now in session.
Everybody rise.

101
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:15,218
On the night of August 21,

102
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:17,847
On the night of August 21,

103
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:21,767
I was just leaving my office
to go home when Bob-

104
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:24,227
Mr. Ewell came in.

105
00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:26,397
Very excited he was,

106
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,233
and he said to get to his house
as quick as I could,

107
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,652
that his girl
had been raped.

108
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:37,281
I got in my car and went out
there as fast as I could.

109
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:40,326
She was pretty well beat up.

110
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,206
I asked her if Tom Robinson
beat her like that.

111
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:47,750
She said, yes, he had.

112
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:51,170
I asked if he'd
taken advantage of her.

113
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,257
She said, "Yes, he did."

114
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:58,385
That's all there was to it.

115
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:02,223
Thank you.

116
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:06,519
Did anybody call a doctor, Sheriff ?

117
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:09,355
- No, sir.
- Why not ?

118
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,691
Well, I didn't think
it was necessary.

119
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:14,110
She was pretty well beat up.

120
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:16,278
Somethin' sure happened.
It was obvious.

121
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:23,744
Now, Sheriff, you say that she was
mighty beat up. In what way ?

122
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,706
Well, she was beaten
around the head.

123
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,874
There were bruises
already comin' on her arms.

124
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,086
She had a black eye startin'.

125
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:36,007
- Which eye ?
- Let's see.

126
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,676
It was her left.

127
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,763
Well, now, was that, uh-

128
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,558
That was her left,
facing you...

129
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,602
or looking the way
that you were ?

130
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:53,023
Oh, yes, that would make it
her right eye.

131
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:56,277
It was her right eye, Mr. Finch.
Now I remember.

132
00:12:56,318 --> 00:13:00,699
She was beaten up
on that side of her face.

133
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,122
Which side again, Heck ?

134
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,041
The right side.

135
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,752
She had bruises
on her arms and...

136
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,755
she showed me her neck.

137
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:21,301
There were definite finger marks
on her gullet.

138
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,302
Well...

139
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:28,475
all around her neck,
at the back of her throat ?

140
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,437
I'd say they were all around.

141
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,781
The witness may be seated.

142
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,325
Robert E. Lee Ewell.

143
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,083
Place your hand
on the Bible, please.

144
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,961
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God ?

145
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,297
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

146
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,467
Now, Mr. Ewell,

147
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:07,555
you tell us,
just in your own words,

148
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,391
what happened on August 21.

149
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,393
Well, that night...

150
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,354
I was comin' from the woods
with a load of kindlin'...

151
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,733
and I heard Mayella screamin'
as I got to the fence.

152
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:23,362
So I dropped my kindlin',
and I run as fast as I could,
but I run into the fence.

153
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,908
But when I got loose,
I run up to the window,

154
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,577
and I seen him
with my Mayella !

155
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,045
What did you do
after you saw the defendant ?

156
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,047
I run around the house
tryin' to get in,

157
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,342
but he done run through the front door
just ahead of me !

158
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,385
But I seen who it was, all right !

159
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:52,892
- I seen him. -

160
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:56,645
And I run in the house and...

161
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,941
poor Mayella was layin'
on the floor squallin'.

162
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,444
Then I run for Mr. Tate
just as quick as I could.

163
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:08,114
Mm-hmm.
Thank you, Mr. Ewell.

164
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:22,253
Would you mind if I just,
uh, ask you a few questions, Mr. Ewell ?

165
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,798
No, sir, Mr. Finch,
I sure wouldn't.

166
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:32,806
Folks were doin' a lot
of running that night.

167
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:37,644
You say that you ran to the house,
you ran to the window,

168
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:42,231
you ran inside, you ran to Mayella,
you ran to Sheriff Tate.

169
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:46,652
Did you, during all this running,
run for a doctor ?

170
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,573
There wasn't no need to.
I seen who done it.

171
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:55,494
Now, Mr. Ewell, you've heard
the sheriff's testimony.

172
00:15:55,577 --> 00:15:57,831
Do you agree with his description
of Mayella's injuries ?

173
00:15:57,914 --> 00:16:02,293
I agree with everything
Mr. Tate said.

174
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:04,294
Her eye was blacked.

175
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:07,965
She was mighty beat up,
mighty beat up.

176
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,556
Now, Mr. Ewell, can you, uh...
can you read and write ?

177
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,727
Yes, sir, Mr. Finch,
I can read and I can write.

178
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:25,899
Good.

179
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:29,194
- Then will you write your name, please.
-

180
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,489
Write there.
Show us.

181
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:05,731
So what's so interesting ?

182
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,732
You're left-handed, Mr. Ewell.

183
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:12,028
What's that got to do with it, Judge ?
I'm a God-fearin' man.

184
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,698
That Atticus Finch,
he's tryin' to take advantage of me !

185
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:17,033
You got to watch tricky lawyers
like Atticus Finch !

186
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:19,869
Quiet. Quiet, sir.

187
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:22,873
Now the witness
may take his seat.

188
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:35,051
Mayella Violet Ewell.

189
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:50,816
Put your hand
on the Bible, please.

190
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,819
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

191
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:55,905
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God ?

192
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,990
Sit down, please.

193
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:04,372
Now, Mayella...

194
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:10,461
suppose you tell us
just what happened, huh ?

195
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:15,008
Well, sir-

196
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:19,511
Sir... I was s-sittin'
on the porch...

197
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:22,514
and he come along.

198
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,646
There's this old chifforobe
in the yard,

199
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:32,191
and l-l said,

200
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:34,943
"You come in here, boy,
and bust up this chifforobe,

201
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:38,114
and I'll give you a nickel."

202
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:40,782
So he come on in the yard,

203
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:44,953
and I go in the house
to get him the nickel...

204
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:48,499
and I turn around
and before I know it, he's on me.

205
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,168
I fought and hollered...

206
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:54,838
but he had me
around the neck...

207
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:58,967
and he hit me,
again and again.

208
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:05,683
And the next thing I knew,
Papa was in the room...

209
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:11,479
a-standin' over me, hollerin',
"Who done it ? Who done it ?"

210
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:14,023
Thank you, Mayella.

211
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,152
Your witness, Atticus.

212
00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:27,245
Miss Mayella,
is your father good to you ?

213
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:31,375
I mean, is he easy
to get along with ?

214
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,710
Does tolerable.

215
00:19:34,793 --> 00:19:37,130
Except when he's drinking.

216
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:43,218
When he's riled...
has he ever beaten you ?

217
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:53,604
My pa's never touched
a hair on my head in my life.

218
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:03,572
You say that you asked Tom to come in
and chop up a- What was it ?

219
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:06,659
A chifforobe.

220
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:11,998
Was that the first time that you ever
asked him to come inside the fence ?

221
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:15,250
Yes.

222
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:20,673
Didn't you ever ask him to come
inside the fence before ?

223
00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:27,012
I might have.

224
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:30,015
Can you remember any other occasion ?

225
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,726
No.

226
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:38,440
You say, "He caught me, he choked me,
and he took advantage of me."

227
00:20:38,523 --> 00:20:40,442
Is that right ?

228
00:20:44,572 --> 00:20:46,906
Do you remember him
beating you about the face ?

229
00:20:48,742 --> 00:20:50,827
No.

230
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,331
I don't...

231
00:20:54,415 --> 00:20:57,167
recollect if he hit me.

232
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:04,799
I mean, y-yes !
H-He hit me !

233
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:07,510
- He hit me ! -

234
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:13,850
Thank you.

235
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,686
Now will you identify
the man who beat you.

236
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:20,023
I most certainly will.
Sittin' right yonder.

237
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:25,027
Tom, will you stand up, please ?

238
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:28,948
Let Miss Mayella
have a good long look at you.

239
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:40,918
Tom, will you
catch this, please ?

240
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:46,424
Thank you.

241
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:53,598
Now, then, this time, will you please
catch it with your left hand.

242
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:56,141
I can't, sir.

243
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,186
Why can't you ?

244
00:21:58,227 --> 00:22:01,188
I can't use
my left hand at all.

245
00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:05,192
I got it caught in a cotton gin
when I was 12 years old.

246
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:08,195
All my muscles were tore loose.

247
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:27,798
Is this the man
who raped you ?

248
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:32,719
It most certainly is.

249
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,721
How ?

250
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:41,270
I don't know how.
He done it.

251
00:22:41,353 --> 00:22:43,480
He just done it.

252
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:46,316
You have testified...

253
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:50,780
that he choked you
and he beat you.

254
00:22:50,863 --> 00:22:56,075
You didn't say that he sneaked up
behind you and knocked you out cold,

255
00:22:56,158 --> 00:23:00,163
but that you turned around...

256
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:03,332
and there he was.

257
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:07,504
Do you want to tell us
what really happened ?

258
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:13,509
I got something to say...

259
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:17,180
and then I ain't
gonna say no more !

260
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,853
He took advantage of me !

261
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:31,360
And if you fine,
fancy gentlemen...

262
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,530
ain't gonna do
nothing about it,

263
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:38,867
then you're just a bunch of lousy,
yellow, stinkin' cowards !

264
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,287
The whole bunch of ya !

265
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:44,623
And your fancy airs
don't come to nothin' !

266
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,626
Your "ma'am"-ing
and your "Miss Mayella"-ing,

267
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:50,963
it don't come to nothin',
Mr. Finch !

268
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:53,967
N-N-

269
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:58,846
You sit down now.

270
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,322
Atticus.

271
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:21,951
Mr. Gilmer.

272
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:29,167
The State rests, Judge.

273
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:39,176
Tom Robinson, take the stand.

274
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,485
Put your hand on the Bible.

275
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,656
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

276
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,823
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God ?

277
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:02,992
- I do. - Sit down.

278
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:17,340
Now, Tom...

279
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:20,843
were you acquainted
with Mayella Violet Ewell ?

280
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:26,682
Yes, sir. I had to pass her place
going to and from the field every day.

281
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:30,853
- Is there any other way to go ?
- No, sir.

282
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:33,189
None's I know of.

283
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:37,693
- And did she ever speak to you ?
- Why, yes, sir.

284
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:40,781
I'd tip my hat when I'd go by.

285
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,950
One day she asked me
to come inside the fence...

286
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:48,120
and bust up
a chifforobe for her.

287
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:50,832
She give me the hatchet,
and I broke it up.

288
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:55,752
And then she said, "I reckon I'll
have to give you a nickel, won't I ?"

289
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:58,965
And I said, "No, ma'am.
There ain't no charge."

290
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:02,468
And I went home.

291
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:07,264
Mr. Finch, that was way last spring.
Way over a year ago.

292
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:10,768
Did you ever go
on the place again ?

293
00:26:13,895 --> 00:26:16,315
Yes, sir.

294
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:18,316
When ?

295
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:24,156
Well, I went lots of times.

296
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:27,158
Seemed like every time
I passed by yonder,

297
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:29,661
she would have
some little something for me to do:

298
00:26:29,744 --> 00:26:32,581
chopping kindlin'
and totin' water for her.

299
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,924
Tom...

300
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:45,968
what happened to you...

301
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:50,307
on the evening of August 21
of last year ?

302
00:26:57,688 --> 00:27:03,486
Mr. Finch, I was going home
as usual that evening.

303
00:27:05,363 --> 00:27:08,324
When I passed the Ewell place,

304
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:12,244
Miss Mayella were on the porch,
like she said she were.

305
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:16,666
She said for me to come there
and help her a minute.

306
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:19,000
Well, I went inside the fence,

307
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:22,838
and I looked around
for some kindlin' to work on,

308
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,924
but I didn't see none.

309
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:32,222
Then she said to come in the house,
she has a door needs fixin'.

310
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:36,226
So I follows her inside,
and I looked at the door...

311
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,980
and it looked all right.

312
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:42,107
Then she shut the door.

313
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:48,822
All the time I was wondering
why it was so quiet.

314
00:27:50,365 --> 00:27:52,784
Then it come to me.

315
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:56,122
There was not a child
on the place.

316
00:27:56,205 --> 00:28:01,375
And I said, "Miss Mayella,
where are the children ?"

317
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:06,131
She said,
"They all gone to get ice cream."

318
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:11,261
She said it took her a year to save
seven nickels, but she'd done it.

319
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:14,639
And they'd all gone to town.

320
00:28:14,723 --> 00:28:16,767
What did you say then ?

321
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:22,313
Well, I said something like...

322
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:27,485
"Why, Miss Mayella,
that's right nice of you to treat 'em."

323
00:28:27,568 --> 00:28:30,155
She said, "You think so ?"

324
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:35,326
Well, I said, "I best be goin'."
I couldn't do nothin' for her.

325
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:37,997
And she said I could.

326
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,083
I asked her what.

327
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:45,587
And she said to just step
on the chair yonder...

328
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:50,592
and get that box down
from on top of the chifforobe.

329
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:54,596
So I done like she told me,

330
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,598
and I was reachin'...

331
00:28:57,682 --> 00:29:02,979
when the next thing I knows,
she grabbed me around the legs.

332
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:14,114
She scared me so bad,
I hopped down and turned the chair over.

333
00:29:14,198 --> 00:29:16,784
That was the only thing-

334
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:19,620
only furniture-
disturbed in the room, Mr. Finch,

335
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:22,248
I swear, when I left it.

336
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:28,045
And what happened after you
turned the chair over ?

337
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,553
Tom ?

338
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:47,147
You've sworn to tell the whole truth.
Will you do it ?

339
00:29:50,442 --> 00:29:53,487
What happened after that ?

340
00:29:57,573 --> 00:30:00,743
Mr. Finch,

341
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:03,539
I got down off the chair,

342
00:30:03,623 --> 00:30:06,875
and I turned around...

343
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,752
and she sorta jumped on me.

344
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:13,924
She hugged me
around the waist.

345
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:18,344
She reached up and kissed me
on the face.

346
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:23,182
She said she'd never kissed
a grown man before...

347
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:26,895
and she might as well kiss me.

348
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:31,065
She says for me
to kiss her back,

349
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:35,153
and I said,
"Miss Mayella, let me outta here,"

350
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:37,156
and I tried to run.

351
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:44,287
Mr. Ewell cussed at her
from the window.

352
00:30:44,371 --> 00:30:46,456
He said he's gonna kill her.

353
00:30:55,006 --> 00:30:56,924
And what happened after that ?

354
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:05,182
I was runnin' so fast,
I don't know what happened.

355
00:31:13,315 --> 00:31:16,986
Tom, did you rape
Mayella Ewell ?

356
00:31:21,198 --> 00:31:24,410
I did not, sir.

357
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:28,038
Did you harm her in any way ?

358
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:37,423
I did not, sir.

359
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:59,486
Robinson,

360
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:03,990
you're pretty good at bustin' up
chifforobes and kindlin'
with one hand, aren't ya ?

361
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:09,079
Strong enough to choke the breath out
of a woman and sling her to the floor ?

362
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:14,583
- I never done that, sir.
- But you're strong enough to.

363
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:19,380
- I reckon so, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

364
00:32:23,467 --> 00:32:28,097
How come you so all fired anxious
to do that woman's chores ?

365
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:34,270
Looks like she, she didn't
have nobody to help her.

366
00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:36,480
Like I said, she-

367
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:39,942
With Mr. Ewell and seven children
on the place ?

368
00:32:39,984 --> 00:32:44,030
You did all this choppin' and work
out of sheer goodness, boy ?

369
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:48,075
You're a mighty good fella, it seems.

370
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:50,536
Did all that
for not one penny ?

371
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:56,250
Yes, sir.
I felt right sorry for her.

372
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,087
- She seemed- -

373
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:17,396
You felt sorry for her ?

374
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:21,358
A white woman ?

375
00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:25,572
You felt sorry for her ?

376
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,063
To begin with,

377
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,773
this case should never
have come to trial.

378
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:05,943
The State has not produced
one iota...

379
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:08,030
of medical evidence...

380
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:11,825
that the crime Tom Robinson
is charged with...

381
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:15,328
ever took place.

382
00:34:15,412 --> 00:34:17,748
It has relied, instead,

383
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,083
upon the testimony
of two witnesses...

384
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,504
whose evidence has not only been
called into serious question...

385
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:27,132
on cross-examination,

386
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:31,677
but has been flatly contradicted
by the defendant.

387
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:36,807
There is circumstantial evidence
to indicate that...

388
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:41,771
Mayella Ewell
was beaten savagely...

389
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:46,484
by someone who led,
almost exclusively, with his left.

390
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:53,323
Tom Robinson now sits before you
having taken the oath...

391
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:57,077
with the only good hand
he possesses,

392
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,789
his right.

393
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:15,262
I have nothing but pity
in my heart...

394
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:19,266
for the chief witness
for the State.

395
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:26,898
She is the victim
of cruel poverty and ignorance.

396
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:33,989
But my pity...

397
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,200
does not extend so far...

398
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:41,622
as to her putting
a man's life at stake,

399
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:47,127
which she has done in an effort
to get rid of her own guilt.

400
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,422
Now I say "guilt," gentlemen,

401
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:56,135
because it was guilt
that motivated her.

402
00:35:57,345 --> 00:36:01,308
She's committed no crime.

403
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:04,269
She has merely broken
a rigid and time-honored...

404
00:36:04,352 --> 00:36:08,023
code of our society-

405
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:12,444
a code so severe that whoever breaks it
is hounded from our midst...

406
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:14,696
as unfit to live with.

407
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,990
She must destroy the evidence...

408
00:36:18,032 --> 00:36:20,743
of her offense.

409
00:36:20,827 --> 00:36:25,457
But what was the evidence
of her offense ?

410
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:29,585
Tom Robinson, a human being.

411
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:36,883
She must put Tom Robinson
away from her.

412
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:42,223
Tom Robinson was to her
a daily reminder...

413
00:36:42,307 --> 00:36:45,100
of what she did.

414
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,521
Now, what did she do ?

415
00:36:48,562 --> 00:36:50,690
She tempted a Negro.

416
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:55,152
She was white,
and she tempted a Negro.

417
00:36:55,236 --> 00:37:00,032
She did something that,
in our society, is unspeakable.

418
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:02,575
She kissed a black man.

419
00:37:02,617 --> 00:37:06,914
Not an old uncle,

420
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:10,083
but a strong, young Negro man.

421
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:16,924
No code mattered to her
before she broke it,

422
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:21,220
but it came crashing down
on her afterwards.

423
00:37:28,143 --> 00:37:32,355
The witnesses for the State,
with the exception of the
sheriff of Maycomb County.

424
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:35,775
have presented themselves
to you gentlemen, to this court...

425
00:37:37,652 --> 00:37:41,739
in the cynical confidence...

426
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:45,785
that their testimony
would not be doubted.

427
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:50,874
Confident that you gentlemen
would go along with them...

428
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:54,585
on the assumption-

429
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:56,755
the evil assumption-

430
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:59,633
that all Negroes lie,

431
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:02,926
all Negroes are basically
immoral beings,

432
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:08,600
all Negro men are not
to be trusted around our women.

433
00:38:10,601 --> 00:38:15,898
An assumption that one associates
with minds of their caliber,

434
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:20,737
and which is, in itself,
gentlemen, a lie,

435
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:27,284
which I do not need
to point out to you.

436
00:38:32,707 --> 00:38:35,751
And so,

437
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:38,963
a quiet, humble,
respectable Negro,

438
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:43,134
who has had the unmitigated
temerity...

439
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:47,638
to feel sorry
for a white woman,

440
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,602
has had to put his word
against two white people's.

441
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:01,526
The defendant is not guilty,

442
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,989
but somebody
in this courtroom is.

443
00:39:06,906 --> 00:39:10,076
Now, gentlemen,

444
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,204
in this country,

445
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:16,290
our courts are the great levelers.

446
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:18,710
In our courts,

447
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:24,216
all men are created equal.

448
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:29,722
I'm no idealist
to believe firmly...

449
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:33,016
in the integrity of our courts
and of our jury system.

450
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:38,020
That's no ideal to me.
That is a living, working reality !

451
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:47,530
Now I am confident that you
gentlemen will review...

452
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:50,824
without passion...

453
00:39:50,908 --> 00:39:55,121
the evidence
that you have heard,

454
00:39:55,205 --> 00:39:58,749
come to a decision...

455
00:39:58,832 --> 00:40:02,045
and restore this man
to his family.

456
00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:16,350
In the name of God,

457
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:20,145
do your duty.

458
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:27,112
In the name of God,

459
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:30,114
believe...

460
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:32,616
Tom Robinson.

461
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,155
How long has the jury
been out now, Reverend ?

462
00:41:11,238 --> 00:41:13,532
Well, let's see.

463
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:16,826
Almost two hours now.

464
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:21,957
I think that's
an awful good sign, don't you ?

465
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,380
Court's now in session.
Everybody rise.

466
00:42:30,858 --> 00:42:32,776
Gentlemen of the jury,

467
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:36,780
- have you reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honor.

468
00:42:41,534 --> 00:42:44,205
Will the defendant please rise
and face the jury ?

469
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:54,590
What is your verdict ?

470
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:57,550
We find the defendant
guilty as charged.

471
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,992
Gentlemen, this jury is dismissed.

472
00:43:26,622 --> 00:43:29,206
Court is adjourned.

473
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,303
I'll go to see Helen
first thing tomorrow morning.

474
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:45,973
I told her not to be disappointed,
we'd probably lose this one.

475
00:43:47,434 --> 00:43:49,853
Tom.

476
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:06,410
Yes, Mr. Finch.

477
00:44:51,038 --> 00:44:53,748
Miss Jean Louise.

478
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:56,668
Miss Jean Louise,
stand up.

479
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:04,174
Your father's passin'.

480
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,372
Atticus ?

481
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:41,254
I-l'm sorry, Atticus.

482
00:45:41,337 --> 00:45:44,466
- Well, thank you, Maudie.
-

483
00:45:52,265 --> 00:45:55,684
Atticus, can I see you
for a minute ?

484
00:45:57,478 --> 00:46:00,105
Will you excuse me ?

485
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,008
Jem ?

486
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:29,550
Yes'm.

487
00:46:32,471 --> 00:46:35,558
I don't know if it'll help,

488
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:38,101
but I want to say this to you.

489
00:46:42,272 --> 00:46:46,151
There's some men
in this world...

490
00:46:46,234 --> 00:46:50,363
who are born to do
our unpleasant jobs for us.

491
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,706
Your father's one of them.

492
00:47:00,832 --> 00:47:03,084
- Oh, well. -

493
00:47:27,233 --> 00:47:29,193
What's the matter, Atticus ?

494
00:47:33,656 --> 00:47:36,575
Tom Robinson's dead.

495
00:47:46,001 --> 00:47:49,756
They were taking him
to Abbottsville...

496
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,384
for safekeeping.

497
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:56,429
Tom broke loose and ran.

498
00:47:56,513 --> 00:48:02,143
The deputy called out
to him to stop,

499
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:05,771
and Tom didn't stop.

500
00:48:05,855 --> 00:48:11,026
He shot at him to wound him
and missed his aim.

501
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:16,239
Killed him.

502
00:48:20,536 --> 00:48:22,705
The deputy says...

503
00:48:26,082 --> 00:48:30,713
Tom just ran like a crazy man.

504
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:44,560
The last thing I told him was not to
lose heart, that we'd ask for an appeal.

505
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:55,946
We had such a good chance.

506
00:48:59,782 --> 00:49:03,578
We had more than a good chance.

507
00:49:17,757 --> 00:49:21,220
I have to go out
and tell his family.

508
00:49:21,304 --> 00:49:24,015
You look after
the children, Maudie.

509
00:49:29,437 --> 00:49:32,273
Atticus, you want me
to go with you ?

510
00:49:32,315 --> 00:49:35,735
No, son, I think I'd better
go out there alone.

511
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:39,154
Atticus.

512
00:49:39,196 --> 00:49:41,490
I'm goin' with you.

513
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:42,991
I'm goin' with you.

514
00:49:43,075 --> 00:49:45,078
All right, son.

515
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:12,771
Hello, Mr. Finch.
I'm Spence, Tom's father.

516
00:50:12,854 --> 00:50:15,441
Hello, Spence.

517
00:50:17,525 --> 00:50:20,238
- Is Helen here ?
- Yes, sir, she's inside lyin' down,

518
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:22,238
tryin' to get
a little sleep.

519
00:50:22,281 --> 00:50:24,824
We been talkin'
about the appeal, Mr. Finch.

520
00:50:24,908 --> 00:50:27,745
How long do you think it'll take ?

521
00:50:29,288 --> 00:50:34,750
Spence, there isn't
going to be any appeal.

522
00:50:36,128 --> 00:50:39,381
Not now.
Tom is dead.

523
00:50:39,465 --> 00:50:41,383
Dead ?

524
00:50:47,972 --> 00:50:51,517
Helen.

525
00:51:20,005 --> 00:51:23,341
Boy.

526
00:51:23,425 --> 00:51:27,345
Go inside and tell Atticus Finch
I said to come out here.

527
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:30,056
Go on, boy.

528
00:53:07,903 --> 00:53:12,531
By October,
things had settled down again.

529
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:18,372
I still looked for Boo
every time I went by the Radley place.

530
00:53:20,415 --> 00:53:24,836
This night my mind was filled
with Halloween.

531
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:29,674
There was to be a pageant representing
our county's agricultural products.

532
00:53:29,757 --> 00:53:33,344
I was to be a ham.

533
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:38,849
Jem said he would escort me
to the school auditorium.

534
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:43,770
Thus began
our longest journey together.

535
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:04,290
- Scout ! - Yeah ?

536
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:08,629
Will you come on ?
Everybody's gone.

537
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:10,965
I can't go home like this.

538
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:13,508
Well, I'm goin'.
It's almost 10:00...

539
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,803
and Atticus will be
waiting for us.

540
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:18,973
All right, I'm comin'.

541
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:22,642
But I feel like a fool
walkin' home like this.

542
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:24,978
It's not my fault
you lost your dress.

543
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:28,148
I didn't lose it.
Just can't find it.

544
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,818
- Where are your shoes ?
- I can't find them either.

545
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,488
- You can get 'em tomorrow.
- But tomorrow's Sunday.

546
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:38,032
You can get the janitor
to let you in. Come on.

547
00:55:05,226 --> 00:55:09,146
Here, Scout. Let me hold onto you
before you break your neck.

548
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:15,988
- Jem, you don't have to hold me.
- Shh.

549
00:55:17,905 --> 00:55:21,158
- What's the matter ?
- Hush a minute, Scout.

550
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:32,003
I thought I heard somethin'.

551
00:55:34,088 --> 00:55:36,257
Ah... come on.

552
00:55:47,351 --> 00:55:50,104
Wait.

553
00:55:50,187 --> 00:55:52,272
- Jem, are you trying to scare me ?
- Shh.

554
00:55:52,355 --> 00:55:55,400
- You know I'm too old.
- Be quiet.

555
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:59,779
- I heard an old dog bayin'.

556
00:55:59,863 --> 00:56:02,949
It's not that. I hear it
when we're walking along.

557
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:06,621
When we stop,
I don't hear it anymore.

558
00:56:06,704 --> 00:56:10,123
Oh, yeah, my costume rustlin'.

559
00:56:10,207 --> 00:56:12,917
Halloween's got ya.

560
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:21,592
I hear it now.

561
00:56:21,634 --> 00:56:25,138
I'll bet it's just old Cecil Jacobs
tryin' to scare me.

562
00:56:25,222 --> 00:56:29,142
Cecil Jacobs
is a big, wet hen !

563
00:56:36,233 --> 00:56:38,151
Come on.

564
00:57:18,523 --> 00:57:22,153
Run, Scout !
Run, Scout ! Run ! Run !

565
00:59:10,341 --> 00:59:12,428
Scout ! Scout !

566
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:17,641
What happened ?
What happened ?

567
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:20,144
I don't know.
I just don't know.

568
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,648
- Cal, tell Dr. Reynolds to come over.
- Yes, sir.

569
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:28,987
- You all right ?
- Yes, sir.

570
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:31,488
- Are you sure ?
- Yes, sir.

571
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:41,915
Sheriff Tate, please.

572
00:59:41,998 --> 00:59:44,751
Atticus, is Jem dead ?

573
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:47,421
No. He's unconscious.

574
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:50,799
We won't know how badly he's hurt
until the doctor gets here.

575
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:53,426
Heck ? Atticus Finch.

576
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:55,846
Someone's been after my children.

577
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:01,267
He's got a bad break.

578
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:04,604
Like somebody tried
to wring his arm off.

579
01:00:10,612 --> 01:00:13,363
I'll be right back, Atticus.

580
01:00:14,697 --> 01:00:16,616
How's the boy, Doc ?

581
01:00:16,699 --> 01:00:18,618
He'll be all right.

582
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:22,789
Sheriff Tate.

583
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:43,309
What is it, Heck ?

584
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:51,317
Bob Ewell's lyin' on the ground
under that tree down yonder...

585
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,863
with a kitchen knife
stuck up under his ribs.

586
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,949
He's dead, Mr. Finch.

587
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:16,841
- Are you sure ?
- Yes, sir.

588
01:01:18,802 --> 01:01:23,348
He's not gonna bother
these children anymore.

589
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:27,644
Miss Scout, you think you could
tell us what happened ?

590
01:01:29,438 --> 01:01:31,523
I don't know.

591
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:33,859
All of a sudden
somebody grabbed me,

592
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:35,903
knocked me down
on the ground.

593
01:01:35,945 --> 01:01:38,697
Jem found me then.

594
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:43,077
Then Mr. Ewell, I reckon,
grabbed him again, and Jem hollered.

595
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,539
Then somebody grabbed me.
Mr. Ewell, I guess.

596
01:01:47,623 --> 01:01:50,750
Somebody grabbed him...

597
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:54,296
and then I heard someone
pantin' and coughin'.

598
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,719
Then I saw someone
carrying Jem.

599
01:02:00,802 --> 01:02:02,971
Well, who was it ?

600
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:09,227
Why, there he is, Mr. Tate.

601
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:13,022
He can tell you his name.

602
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:41,133
Hey, Boo.

603
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:47,807
Miss Jean Louise,
Mr. Arthur Radley.

604
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:52,603
I believe he already knows you.

605
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:04,490
Heck, let's go out
on the front porch.

606
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:20,840
Would you like to say good night
to Jem, Mr. Arthur ?

607
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:46,948
You can pet him, Mr. Arthur.
He's asleep.

608
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:50,494
You couldn't if he was awake, though.
He wouldn't let you.

609
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:56,624
Go ahead.

610
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:37,331
Let's go set in the swing, Mr. Arthur.

611
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:44,297
Heck, l-l-

612
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:49,593
I guess that
the thing to do is, uh-

613
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:57,267
Good Lord...
I must be losin' my memory.

614
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:04,274
I can't remember
whether Jem is 12 or 13.

615
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:13,116
Anyway, it'll have to come
before the county court.

616
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,998
Of course, it's a clear-cut case
of self-defense.

617
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,627
I'll, uh- Well, I'll run down
to the office-

618
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,297
Mr. Finch...

619
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,966
do you think Jem
killed Bob Ewell ?

620
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,302
Is that what you think ?

621
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:35,639
Your boy never stabbed him.

622
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:56,117
Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

623
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,621
He killed himself.

624
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:05,960
There's a black man
dead for no reason.

625
01:06:06,044 --> 01:06:09,964
Now the man
responsible for it is dead.

626
01:06:10,048 --> 01:06:13,133
Let the dead bury the dead
this time, Mr. Finch.

627
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:15,636
I never heard tell it was
against the law for any citizen...

628
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:18,306
to do his utmost to prevent a crime
from being committed,

629
01:06:18,389 --> 01:06:20,475
which is exactly what he did.

630
01:06:20,558 --> 01:06:26,147
But maybe you'll tell me
it's my duty to tell the town
all about it, not to hush it up.

631
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,650
You know what'll happen then.

632
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:30,986
All the ladies in Maycomb,
includin' my wife,

633
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:35,489
will be knockin' on his door
bringin' angel food cakes.

634
01:06:35,572 --> 01:06:38,827
To my way of thinkin',
takin' one man,

635
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:41,705
who done you and this town
a big service,

636
01:06:41,788 --> 01:06:45,916
and draggin' him with his shy ways
into the limelight-

637
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,253
To me, that's a sin.

638
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:51,422
It's a sin.

639
01:06:51,506 --> 01:06:55,425
And I'm not about
to have it on my head.

640
01:06:55,509 --> 01:06:58,428
I may not be much,
Mr. Finch,

641
01:06:58,512 --> 01:07:02,099
but I'm still Sheriff
of Maycomb County,

642
01:07:02,182 --> 01:07:06,269
and Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

643
01:07:06,353 --> 01:07:08,272
Good night, sir.

644
01:07:47,477 --> 01:07:50,104
Mr. Tate was right.

645
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,778
What do you mean ?

646
01:07:56,820 --> 01:08:00,615
Well...
it would be...

647
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:04,953
sort of like shooting
a mockingbird, wouldn't it ?

648
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:35,149
Thank you, Arthur.

649
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:45,910
Thank you for my children.

650
01:09:00,174 --> 01:09:03,427
Neighbors bring food with death...

651
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:05,596
and flowers with sickness...

652
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,266
and little things in between.

653
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:12,102
Boo was our neighbor.

654
01:09:12,186 --> 01:09:14,938
He gave us two soap dolls,

655
01:09:15,021 --> 01:09:17,774
a broken watch and chain,

656
01:09:17,858 --> 01:09:20,110
a knife...

657
01:09:20,194 --> 01:09:22,612
and our lives.

658
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:30,454
One time Atticus said...

659
01:09:30,537 --> 01:09:35,958
you never really knew a man
until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them.

660
01:09:40,547 --> 01:09:44,717
Just standing
on the Radley porch was enough.

661
01:09:51,308 --> 01:09:55,061
The summer that had begun
so long ago had ended,

662
01:09:55,145 --> 01:09:57,563
and another summer
had taken its place.

663
01:09:57,647 --> 01:09:59,607
And a fall.

664
01:09:59,649 --> 01:10:03,111
And Boo Radley had come out.

665
01:10:06,322 --> 01:10:09,783
I was to think
of these days many times,

666
01:10:09,825 --> 01:10:11,912
of Jem and Dill...

667
01:10:11,995 --> 01:10:15,248
and Boo Radley
and Tom Robinson.

668
01:10:16,999 --> 01:10:19,252
And Atticus.

669
01:10:27,009 --> 01:10:31,097
He would be
in Jem's room all night,

670
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:36,102
and he would be there when Jem
waked up in the morning.
