1
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,678
Dino, next time tell me
when you borrow a car.

2
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,950
Ah damned, forgot.

3
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,558
- Do you have one with more leg room?
- Well, if you push the chair back...

4
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,313
...the leg room will improve...

5
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,473
- Signore Kelder, you look great.
- Dino.

6
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,188
I'm sure you drive the women wild.

7
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,311
Dino, it's going well here. Thanks.

8
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,988
Listen...

9
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,156
...this is your seventh,
eighth time here.

10
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,112
- Have you ever been in love?
- Definitely.

11
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,470
- Madly.
- Not with a car.

12
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,308
That's cruel. What you say is so cruel,
because you've broken her heart.

13
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,830
She sees you here every week
and every week you let her down.

14
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,431
Look, this car is crying
and who has to comfort her? Me.

15
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,269
Forget this car. OK?
You're not good enough for her.

16
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,797
What the hell are you doing?

17
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,237
Hey, show-off...

18
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,270
OK, I'll just do it.

19
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,516
Come on.
You take care of it.

20
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,951
Dino Valentino,
we're not in Italy, you know.

21
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,799
But he signed. I knew it!

22
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,837
Are you so eager to take risks?

23
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,958
When someone is determined,
there are no risks.

24
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,116
Life has to be exciting, Carlo.

25
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,189
When you wound the pride
of a guy like that, he'll buy.

26
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,719
Take risks, you mean.

27
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,591
- Hey, Carlo, you can trust me.
- Just don't exaggerate. Capiche.

28
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,234
Take it easy with those chocolates.

29
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,838
Good evening, princess.

30
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,915
Have you seen a life buoy
around here?

31
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,519
Because when I look into your eyes,
I'm drowning.

32
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,558
Help...

33
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,995
That seat is occupied.

34
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,436
Well, then I just liberated it.

35
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,674
It's for you.

36
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,153
The meeting for failed machos
is down the hall. Good luck.

37
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,874
You know quite well
you're going home with me.

38
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,550
- Yes, in your dreams.
- I only dream of you, <i>bella.</i>

39
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,874
That's all you've got?

40
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,117
- I've heard better pick-up lines.
- Is that right?

41
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,072
Hey, where are you going?

42
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,074
DJ!

43
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,034
Happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you...

44
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,591
Congratulations.

45
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,308
Hip hip hurray!

46
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,399
Stop it.

47
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,273
- It tickles.
- You changed your tune, right?

48
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,553
How would you like looking like a fool
like that?

49
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,877
I was just a bit of fun.
It was a surprise.

50
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,431
What do you mean 'surprise'?

51
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,233
It's not even my birthday.

52
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,318
We've been together
for exactly one year today.

53
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,954
Really? Today?

54
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,995
Today...

55
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,555
To another year.

56
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,914
To all the years that follow it.

57
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,075
The two of us forever.

58
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,508
Oh, that's so sweet.

59
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,559
A cow.

60
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,869
Cow?

61
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,079
I love it.

62
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,034
Thank you.

63
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,153
It's beautiful, David.

64
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,239
How much do I owe you?

65
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,275
Twenty.

66
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,516
There you go. Keep the change.

67
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,675
Thanks a lot.

68
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,558
The pasta, olives...

69
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,876
...and the <i>melanzane alla parmigiana.</i>

70
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,435
Don't forget the peppers.

71
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,313
- Goodbye.
- Thanks, Salvatore.

72
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,669
Have a good trip.

73
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,911
EXPECTED

74
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,673
LANDED

75
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,709
Mom!

76
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,076
Farid.

77
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,034
- How was your flight?
- Very good, mom.

78
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,955
Sweetheart?

79
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,670
No mirrors in Italy?
There's hair underneath your lip.

80
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,239
That's the fashion in Rome.

81
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,519
What kind of fashion is that in Rome?
Let's go.

82
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,393
Hey, Farid!

83
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,199
- Hey, Mounir! Everything all right?
- Sure. Relaxing, hanging out.

84
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,594
That's important too.

85
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,068
What?

86
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,353
Tell them.

87
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,879
I can't.

88
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,238
- You've been lying to them for a year.
- I can't tell mom and dad.

89
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,998
What if they show up at work?

90
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,839
They wanted an Italian, OK?
Moroccan, Italian, what's the difference?

91
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,110
Only this much.

92
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,234
You know that I have no choice.
If it weren't for Monique...

93
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,557
- If I hadn't met Monique...
- If, if, if.

94
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,549
Does she love you?

95
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,354
- Of course.
- Then she won't care.

96
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,790
She won't. Honestly.

97
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,715
From the best trattoria in Rome.
Look...

98
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,799
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Pasta...

99
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,073
- Olives...
- Thank you, sweetheart.

100
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,036
And a small bonus...

101
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,708
Why?
You shouldn't have.

102
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,430
Of course he should have.
My son, Farid.

103
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,595
I missed you.

104
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,798
- Everything all right?
- I slept badly, but it's not too bad.

105
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,395
- How come?
- Oh, nothing.

106
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,349
What's that?

107
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,956
- It's the fashion in Italy.
- Fashion.

108
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,791
- Look, this one is for mom.
- It's beautiful.

109
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,913
- This one for Aziza.
- Thank you.

110
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,795
- And this one is for Ghalia.
- Thank you.

111
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,389
Sears?

112
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,155
- And I brought this one for my nephew.
- Wow, Pirlo's shirt!

113
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,430
- That's enough.
- But it's not sweet.

114
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,392
- Like it?
- Thank you.

115
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,794
You're welcome.

116
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,959
Farid really made it
in that faraway Italy.

117
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,798
Well, I worked hard for it.

118
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,758
And I was a little lucky.

119
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,716
Look, Karim was lucky with Ghalia.

120
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,711
Lucky? Sure. But they don't
want to give me a job.

121
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,879
'Sorry, we already have a Moroccan.'
- There we go again.

122
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,469
Try harder.
They don't just hand it to you.

123
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,914
What do you know about it?

124
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,476
Easy. You're only interested
in big talk and soccer.

125
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,756
I was already promoted at your age.

126
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,798
Yes, to manager assembly belt.

127
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,753
Don't be cheeky.

128
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,719
Calm down, all of you.
Farid has a good job.

129
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,798
You have a good wife
and a beautiful son.

130
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,312
But you, son? Isn't it about time
you brought a woman home?

131
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,510
She's right.
Will you stay a bachelor forever?

132
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,119
It's about time.

133
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,117
Of course.

134
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,788
She's in Italy. In Rome.

135
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,037
I knew it.
I just had that feeling.

136
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,678
She works for a famous designer
of wedding dresses. Her name's Monique.

137
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,599
Bring her along some day,
so we can meet her.

138
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,677
Yes, bring her along.

139
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,279
Yeah.

140
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,752
<i>Sweety, hope're having fun in Italy.</i>
<i>Miss you. X</i>

141
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,909
<i>Miss you too. Sleep well. X</i>

142
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,393
Sleep well, son.

143
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,199
Sleep well, mom.

144
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,034
When someone is determined,
there are no risks.

145
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,837
Things always go smoothly for me.

146
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,789
Gorgeous.

147
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,232
What is this?

148
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,670
You like surprises, don't you?

149
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,034
Yes.

150
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,788
I've got one for you.

151
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,679
Dear Dino...

152
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,517
I've never been as happy
as I was this past year.

153
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,235
I love you.

154
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,753
I love your...

155
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,954
...tenderness.
I love your craziness.

156
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,596
But I mostly love your honesty.

157
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,478
So, honey...

158
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,511
...I'd like to ask you something.

159
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,429
Esther?

160
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,675
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

161
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,112
What's your answer?

162
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,393
And you said 'yes'?

163
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,119
Yeah.

164
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,997
So this is the moment of truth, isn't it?

165
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,272
- The moment of your coming out.
- What should I say?

166
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,476
That your name is Farid Ben Saoud.

167
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,669
That you used to be a taxi driver.
That you're descended from Moroccans.

168
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,514
Moroccans are very honest and loyal,
you know.

169
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,348
Right. And you're the perfect example.

170
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,509
Sorry.

171
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,757
Listen, if she really loves you...

172
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,077
...she'll understand that you pretended.

173
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,435
She's the one, Dave.
I'm nothing without her.

174
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,039
That's why.

175
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,238
What are you thinking about?

176
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,359
Nothing.

177
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,156
That's so cute.

178
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,591
You Italians have a big mouth,
but without clothes...

179
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,518
- No.
- Yes.

180
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,995
That's got nothing to do with it.

181
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,474
Monique...

182
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,793
I love you.

183
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,153
It's just that...

184
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,834
I...

185
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,357
- I...
- I know who your are.

186
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,673
Do you?

187
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,270
Yes, you're the love of my life.

188
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,111
It's such a shame that my mom
never got to know you.

189
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,478
Sweetie, I know you have to get used
to the idea. It's a big step for me too.

190
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,312
- Is it?
- Of course.

191
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,959
Monique...

192
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,557
'You are my love.'
And then?

193
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,352
'You are my love.'

194
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,834
'You are my truth.'

195
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,678
Beautifully put.

196
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,438
Are you Italian?

197
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,036
Me too. For how long
have you been in the Netherlands?

198
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,671
Things always go smoothly for me.

199
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,789
Smoothly?

200
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,357
But for how long have you
been living in the Netherlands?

201
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,599
In the Netherlands?

202
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,474
How...

203
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,593
Good morning...

204
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,757
Certainly, yes...

205
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,958
Let's go.

206
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,515
- What?
- He's staring at your boobs.

207
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,428
- What's wrong?
- Well...

208
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,551
- ...those Italians!
- Huh?

209
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,278
Sweetie, let's go to Italy next week.

210
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,710
- Why?
- You want to tell your parents too, right?

211
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,273
- My parents?
- Yes!

212
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,233
No, I have a better idea.
Ask them to come here.

213
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,670
Then I can introduce them to my dad.

214
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,394
Your dad? My dad?

215
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,716
That's a lot of dads at once.

216
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,592
Have you picked a date yet?

217
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,676
How about August 12?

218
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,316
That's when your mom and I
got married.

219
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,956
Beautiful summer day,
reception in an orchard...

220
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,993
- ...sultry summer evening.
- That's not possible, dad.

221
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,876
I phoned city hall. Because he has
a foreign passport, we need at least...

222
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,119
- ...six months to get all the right papers.
- Foreign passport?

223
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,673
What's today?

224
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,236
February 14 is a possibility then.
My parents' wedding day.

225
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,829
- In winter?
- That's excellent.

226
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,076
Fire baskets, lights everywhere.

227
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,716
- You guys in a reindeer sled.
- Dad!

228
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,037
- That's my father all over, right?
- Yeah.

229
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,958
What the heck is this?

230
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,471
Did you glue that picture on yourself?

231
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,713
Maserati believed this
when they hired you? It looks crappy.

232
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,279
You can't take this to city hall.

233
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,434
What?

234
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,356
No way. Absolutely not.

235
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,394
No fucking way.
I'm a painter, not a passport forger.

236
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,311
- Leave Nienke out of it. OK?
- Why not do it together?

237
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,511
- A romantic project.
- Oh, shut up.

238
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,234
- Come on. It's for a good cause.
- No way.

239
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,113
Jesus, man.

240
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,276
- Some friend you are.
- At least I'm honest.

241
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,911
<i>Grazie,</i> honest friend.

242
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,469
You were going to tell her,
weren't you?

243
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,955
Honey, honey...

244
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,592
How nice that you were able
to come so quickly.

245
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,870
Give your brother a kiss.

246
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,549
The doctor.

247
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,638
Hello. He's out of danger.

248
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,268
Thank you.

249
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,878
We performed an angioplasty.

250
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,789
He needs regular check-ups
and a lot of rest.

251
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,674
OK?

252
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,995
I told your husband before:
Less fat, less sugar.

253
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,589
But he doesn't listen. He's stubborn.

254
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,555
- Has my dad been here before?
- He came here a month ago.

255
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,359
His chest hurt.

256
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,708
- You can go and see him. Good luck.
- Thank you.

257
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,837
My son, Farid.

258
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,912
Dear wife, your cooking's too good.
I just ate too much.

259
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,760
Stop it.
The doctor told me everything.

260
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,191
Mom, this isn't the right time.
Come on.

261
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,630
So when should I yell?
When he's dead?

262
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,555
If we lie to each other in this family,
where does that leave us?

263
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,109
He lied because he didn't
want to worry you.

264
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,471
Not worry?
It's my job to worry.

265
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,355
Do you hear me?
That's my responsibility.

266
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,158
Calm down, mom.

267
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,316
Karim, go and calm down your mother.

268
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,388
Ghalia.

269
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,273
- I've blown it with her, haven't I?
- No, dad. You didn't.

270
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,949
Listen...

271
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,153
It's nearly Ramadan.

272
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,673
You're not allowed to observe Ramadan.
For your health. The doctor...

273
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,111
That's why I want you to replace me
during Ramadan.

274
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,798
- Me?
- Yes.

275
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,193
Dad...

276
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,551
You know that I haven't been
observing it for years.

277
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,193
Ask Karim or Aziza.

278
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,354
Aziza?

279
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,356
When Aziza wants to eat...

280
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,109
...she closes the curtains.

281
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,197
Listen, Farid...

282
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,749
The only thing I have left...

283
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,037
...is the Ramadan.

284
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,592
Of course, dad.
I'll do the Ramadan for you.

285
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,238
Thank you, my son.

286
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,318
- Are you really going to do it?
- Of course. I promised dad.

287
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,035
- You won't last longer than a day.
- Of course I will.

288
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,595
No eating and drinking before sunset?

289
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,028
And no lying?

290
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,711
That's not allowed either.

291
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,279
- What?
- Sex.

292
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,837
- Just thinking about it is forbidden.
- Not at night, though.

293
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,556
You're not married are you?

294
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,559
Then it's not allowed, anyway.
Especially not during Ramadan.

295
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,676
Can't I just a bit?

296
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,073
You know, a bit...

297
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,595
Thoughts have to be pure.

298
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,435
Oh, come on!

299
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,474
Dino, do you know
why I'm always benched?

300
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,836
Yes, naturally.

301
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,029
The secret weapon.

302
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,152
Every team has one.
You're ours, Nourdin.

303
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,951
Last week I could have made
the difference against Nissan.

304
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,993
If I'd have been allowed to play,
I'd have scored.

305
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,078
Tactical error!
I'll talk to Karel about it.

306
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,989
Hey, Nourdin.

307
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,390
Will you be able to play soccer?
I mean, tomorrow the Ramadan starts.

308
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,799
How do you know?

309
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,194
General education.

310
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,197
Isn't it tough?

311
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,552
Well, I think Ramadan is a nice month.

312
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,599
A month of contemplation,
discipline, purification...

313
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,430
...getting in touch with yourself,
your family, your Maker.

314
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,235
Yeah, man, it's a nice month.
But...

315
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,955
...now, during summer...

316
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,679
...long days.

317
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,193
No eating, no drinking.
Not even when it's 35 degrees.

318
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,873
And no water either,
if that's what you think.

319
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,150
Yeah, man.

320
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,919
Ramadan during summer
is sheer hell.

321
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,315
Dino, want to become a Muslim?

322
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,190
And 'hell', come on...

323
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,472
Restraint during the day
and gluttony at night.

324
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,716
Not to mention the Döner kebab.

325
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,879
- Dude, Döner is Turkish.
- I'm talking about the women.

326
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,913
Moroccan women have
the most beautiful black hair.

327
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,872
Get out. I have work to do.

328
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,309
Pray at 3.17 AM, at 5.43 AM...

329
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,476
...at 1.47 p. m...

330
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,110
How?

331
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,190
Which freak made up this schedule?

332
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,554
Hello.

333
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,228
- Am I interrupting?
- You? Never!

334
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,436
I figured I'd surprise my fiancé,
because he loves that.

335
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,959
How nice!

336
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,957
- Busy?
- Mwah.

337
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,993
Look at that: The lovebirds.

338
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,359
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, dad.

339
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,068
How do you say that in Italian, Dino?

340
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,352
- Coffee?
- Yes.

341
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,795
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

342
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,119
Come on, man.

343
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,993
I even had passport photos taken.
David, look.

344
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,231
I don't have time for this.
I have to finish this by tomorrow.

345
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,714
Jesus, man!

346
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,434
No, sorry, Farid.

347
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,395
Dammit.

348
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,598
- Dino, what's wrong?
- I have to go for a pee.

349
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,036
Well... watching your weight?

350
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,675
Sorry.

351
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,319
I'll think about it.

352
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,558
You're probably wondering
why I wanted to see you.

353
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,079
- I'm leaving at the end of the year.
- Where to?

354
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,719
To Las Vegas.

355
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,912
They want me to replace Celine Dion
during her pregnancy.

356
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,552
I'm retiring.

357
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,429
I want the best person to succeed me.

358
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,789
As manager?

359
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,553
- Exactly.
- Where do you want me to sign?

360
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,398
It's not that simple.

361
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,275
The head office in Modena is strict.
They decide.

362
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,552
I recommended both of you.
You both have qualities.

363
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,553
Lammers, you're good with numbers.

364
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,312
Dino, you're Italian.

365
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,556
To show what you're capable of:
Qatar wants twenty Quattroportes.

366
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,033
Twenty!

367
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,198
They're coming here next week.
That's your chance.

368
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,549
So, gentlemen...

369
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,279
...get to work.

370
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,874
Deal.

371
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,315
Dino!

372
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,189
Can I talk to you?

373
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,191
Fight for it, Dino,
so I know you really deserve Monique.

374
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,958
Really deserve!

375
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,559
Things always go smoothly for me.

376
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,910
Right. Of course.

377
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,436
Come on, Dino! Come on!

378
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,594
Let me play!

379
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,552
Come on, Dino.

380
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,233
The secret weapon.

381
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,719
Dino.

382
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,156
Dino, are you OK?

383
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,079
Have a drink.

384
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,238
- Has the sun set yet?
- The sun?

385
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,591
I'm leaving.

386
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,353
Do you realize we have to let
Nourdin play now?

387
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,670
- Can I?
- No.

388
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,235
- Can I?
- Go.

389
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,476
I expect at least two goals from you.

390
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,956
- Hey, Dino!
- Fuck off.

391
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,636
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

392
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,634
Honey?

393
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,634
<i>Merda, merda, merda</i>
means 'luck.'

394
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,718
Then the Italians say:
<i>Merda, merda, merda.</i>

395
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,630
Just like the English say: Break a leg.
Germans say: <i>Hals und Beinbruch.</i>

396
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,308
- Those Germans with their macho cars...
- Honey?

397
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,589
- Are you OK?
- Fine.

398
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,076
- You're perspiring. Are you ill?
- No, I'm fine.

399
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,475
I talked to city hall.

400
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,475
We have an appointment tomorrow
for the marriage license.

401
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,477
I can't tomorrow.

402
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,672
I have two appointments
and a video call.

403
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,872
I have to phone someone back.
A customer's coming by.

404
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,548
- Tomorrow's no good.
- That's the only opportunity.

405
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,270
- But...
- Or have you changed your mind?

406
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,197
- Oh, honey. Tomorrow, OK?
- Tomorrow.

407
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,669
Dad...

408
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,314
David, please. Help me.

409
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,111
They didn't even want to look
at my paintings.

410
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,914
- Who?
- That fucking jury.

411
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,957
- I'm just not talented.
- Come on. You're super-talented.

412
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,673
You really helped me out.

413
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,279
True. He really helped me.

414
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,828
With what?

415
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,395
Playing mysterious games
while I'm in trouble!

416
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,275
Thanks a lot!
Couple of failed Picassos.

417
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,239
Oh, right.
We've got something for you.

418
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,389
What?

419
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,149
No!

420
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,679
No!

421
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,793
Yes.

422
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,714
- That's me!
- We hope so.

423
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,229
This is great! Fantastic!

424
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,036
- OK, your passports.
- There you go.

425
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,192
That looks fine.
There you go.

426
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,956
- There you go.
- Thank you.

427
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,479
That's me.

428
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,680
- Born in Rome.
- Rome, yes, Italy.

429
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,189
You see a lot of passports each day.
Look at...

430
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,678
- Yes.
- Nice.

431
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,199
Sorry, he has ADHD.

432
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,479
1.85 meter.

433
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,875
1.85, right.

434
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,954
1.85.

435
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,239
About.

436
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,070
OK. There you go.

437
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,271
- Is fine?
- Yes, it is.

438
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,788
Then you just need to sign.

439
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,670
- Madam over here and sir over there.
- Thank you.

440
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,278
- Well...
- Well.

441
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,399
Dino...

442
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,633
...Valentino.

443
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,476
Here you go.

444
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,433
Honey, <i>amore,</i> hold on.

445
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,751
I have to tell you something.

446
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,759
I was thinking...

447
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,713
It might be nice not to have sex
before we get married.

448
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,074
It's tradition.

449
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,716
- Tradition, Italy, calzone.
- Huh?

450
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,151
I know it's difficult,
but it brings us together.

451
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,952
It will make us stronger.

452
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,550
Contemplation, discipline,
in touch with yourself.

453
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,430
It's so pure.

454
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,790
Just as pure as my love for you.

455
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,072
More importantly:
The reward is the wedding night.

456
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,556
- I'm really looking forward to it.
- This makes no sense.

457
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,915
It's...

458
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,599
Yes, but... we can...

459
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,234
Can't we try something else?

460
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,230
And now I'm going to unhook your bra.

461
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,639
With your teeth?

462
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,559
No, in my mind.

463
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,828
Hey...

464
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,952
- You have to focus.
- I am.

465
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,633
Wait a minute.

466
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,872
I'm kissing your earlobe.

467
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,474
- What?
- What?

468
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,796
- Feel it?
- No, honey, I had an itch.

469
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,675
- Stop this nonsense.
- Nonsense?

470
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,589
- You're too tense.
- I'm not tense at all. Come here.

471
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,997
- Monique, wait. I...
- I really want you.

472
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,350
- Monique, sorry, OK?
- Hey!

473
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,552
I'm trying to spice up our sex life
and you...

474
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,274
You want me to jump your bones
like a wild guy.

475
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,232
Yes, Dino.

476
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,000
That's what I want.
How hard can that be?

477
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,795
I want you to touch me.
Make love to me. Penetrate me!

478
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,355
Louder, so the neighbors
can enjoy it too.

479
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,559
The neighbors?

480
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,198
What's going on with you?

481
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,308
I... I want...

482
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,112
It's not allowed. I mean...

483
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,953
It's very tense at work
and that competition with Lammers.

484
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,830
Bullshit. You're talking about traditions,
you're busy.

485
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,035
Why don't you want to make love to me?

486
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,793
Be honest.

487
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,717
- If you don't want to be with me anymore...
- That's not it.

488
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,230
All I want is to be with you.
You're gorgeous.

489
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,352
So show it, Dino. Do something.

490
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,073
I do...

491
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,988
What are you doing?

492
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,798
I'm penetrating you in my mind.

493
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,710
Princess.

494
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,874
I love you.
Isn't that the most important thing?

495
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,389
- Stop it with your 'princess'.
- Please...

496
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,955
You're everything to me.
Where are you going?

497
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,552
- I'm going home.
- I...

498
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,398
I phoned my parents!

499
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,159
They're coming.

500
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,679
Monique, this is my dad.

501
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,553
- Salvatore.
- Hello, Monique.

502
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,433
I'm Salvatore.
It's so nice to meet you.

503
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,358
- Sorry, in English.
- Pardon?

504
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,993
- No Dutch.
- Why not?

505
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,078
You're from Italy.
Monique, this is my papa.

506
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,078
Papa is the Pope.
You have to say pápá.

507
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,230
Sorry, you say Farid,
but it's Dino.

508
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,758
Maybe that's not a good idea.
My father doesn't sing.

509
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,468
- Italians have to be a bit...
- You're exaggerating.

510
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,671
I'm not exaggerating. Again.

511
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,599
I'm not tense at all.
It just has to go well.

512
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,156
- Tell Monique...
- OK, there she is.

513
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,158
Could you please bring your wife along?

514
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,230
Some appetizers.

515
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,955
Thank you.

516
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,749
Monica...

517
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,869
Cheers.

518
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,068
Cheers.

519
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,158
To the future and to <i>our</i> family.

520
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,517
- Monique, please don't encourage him.
- Just let him.

521
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,068
Can't you make him stop?

522
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,793
- Stop.
- I'm working on it.

523
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,989
This isn't a pizzeria.

524
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,956
- Pizzeria?
- Mom, please...

525
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,759
Are you crazy?
You and your ridiculous snob joint!

526
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,433
Stop it!

527
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,355
Let me explain. Hold on.

528
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,554
- This isn't how I pictured this dinner.
- Me neither! But they're villagers.

529
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,955
They're in the big city.
What do they know?

530
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,869
They're tired from that delayed flight.
And what was up with my dad?

531
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,197
- He'd been drinking.
- Are you blaming your parents?

532
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,949
- Not really. But my dad...
- Never mind, Dino.

533
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,951
I want to be alone tonight.

534
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,355
- Monica, I'm coming with you.
- No.

535
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,077
- I'm not letting you go on your own.
- Leave me be.

536
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,078
- Leave you be? Can't I come with you?
- No.

537
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,669
<i>Bella,</i> listen...

538
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,832
Just tell her.

539
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,036
No, that isn't an option.

540
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,869
Thanks.

541
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,197
You need to tell her.
Don't procrastinate.

542
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,994
How? She wants some time to think.

543
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,237
Then take her abroad
and tell her there.

544
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,109
Yes. Faraway from everything.

545
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,278
No woman will refuse that offer.
Honestly.

546
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,673
- Hello?
<i>- Cara,</i> it's me.

547
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,553
No, Dino, honestly... Go away.

548
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,993
- But I have a surprise.
- I've had enough of your surprises.

549
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,873
But this is a very special surprise.

550
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,390
Let's do it completely differently.

551
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,989
Just the way we always do it.
The two of us.

552
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,316
Away with that whole fuss.

553
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,192
Ticket to Las Vegas.

554
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,756
We'll get married there.
What do you think? Tomorrow.

555
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,709
I'll pick you up at five.
Please give me one more chance.

556
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,879
Las Vegas?

557
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,719
Good morning.

558
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,518
- Hey, asshole, what are you doing?
- Isn't <i>vaffanculo</i> Italian?

559
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,593
Since when do Italians
observe Ramadan?

560
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,479
Never heard of Italian Muslims?

561
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,636
I'm sure you have a damn good reason
for this, Farid Ben Saoud.

562
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,794
Fuck. You... you...

563
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,233
- Explain.
- What do you mean?

564
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,589
Why are you doing do this?

565
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,439
Would I have been hired here
as a Moroccan?

566
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,029
They were looking for
an Italian salesman.

567
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,073
OK. Let me tell Karel and Monique.
Don't say anything.

568
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,068
- When were you planning on doing that?
- I'm waiting for the right moment.

569
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,679
Jesus Christ, Dino.

570
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,318
- Farid.
- It's all I ask.

571
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,069
I don't see any reason why I
shouldn't go up there to tell him.

572
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,952
- Why?
- I have to think of myself.

573
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,473
Don't you get that?

574
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,950
I'll withdraw from the race. OK?

575
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,154
Deal?

576
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,871
You're kidding.

577
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,274
Well...

578
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,109
He's my favorite uncle, Vincenzo.

579
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,993
He's very ill, so I have to travel
back and forth.

580
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,599
But that's temporary.

581
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,272
- But giving up? Really? You?
- But I...

582
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,313
- I won't make a good manager.
- Bullshit!

583
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,229
You underestimate yourself.
You've got style. Customers love you.

584
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,714
Still, I won't do it.

585
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,639
The best choices are you and Lammers.

586
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,150
- So Lammers.
- No way! Don't abandon me now.

587
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,396
- Didn't Lammers tell you?
- No.

588
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,991
Those Qatarians are coming at five
and you'll be there. Or no wedding.

589
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,279
- What?
<i>- Basta.</i> Understand?

590
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,752
- Hey, sweetie.
- Honey.

591
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,831
<i>Good thing you're calling.</i>

592
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,474
Should I bring a warm sweater?

593
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,955
<i>Monique, your dad needs me</i>
<i>for a huge deal.</i>

594
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,869
- I won't be able to make five o'clock.
- What?

595
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,117
Take a cab to the airport
and I'll meet you at check-in.

596
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,880
<i>I'll come as soon as I'm done here.</i>
<i>OK?</i>

597
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,712
- Fine.
<i>- Ciao, baby.</i>

598
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,395
Bye.

599
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,875
Good morning!

600
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,957
- Hi, I'm Lammers.
- Hello.

601
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,470
Have a seat, ladies.
I'm sure you'll like this car.

602
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,393
Have a seat.

603
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,319
400HP. Leather interior.

604
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,910
Sir, this car is fit for a king.

605
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,633
- Enjoy your meal.
- It's not what you think.

606
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,837
Listen, I'm ill. Back pain. Medication.
Then you're allowed to eat. Honestly.

607
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,231
Listen, I badly need your help.

608
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,108
See you.

609
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,875
The Prince of Qatar.

610
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,513
He's coming too.

611
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,390
- Why?
- Why, why? Lammers...

612
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,195
It's a huge deal. Come on.
Twenty cars like that.

613
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,558
So the meeting has moved
to the Krasnapolsky hotel.

614
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:31,551
And Karel is leaving it up to us
as a kind of ultimate test.

615
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:34,278
What do you mean by 'us'?

616
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,999
We. I'm coming with you
if you need me.

617
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,590
- I don't need you.
- In case you can't handle it on your own.

618
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,631
- Of course I can.
- Are you sure?

619
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,677
- Yes.
- OK.

620
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,199
- Ciao.
- Good luck.

621
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,830
- Aren't those Qatarians here yet?
- No.

622
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,672
- Where's Lammers?
- Don't know.

623
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,233
Very professional.

624
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,874
- I'll call him.
- I'll call him.

625
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,071
Yes, Lammers. Karel and I
are wondering what's keeping you.

626
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,229
- In a traffic jam? Come on!
- Come on!

627
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,591
You should have left sooner. Hurry!

628
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,713
Not very professional. Be on time
when you want to achieve something.

629
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,639
Dino, you and I will take care of it.

630
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,078
What's he saying?

631
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,759
That shipment to Qatar
will be very expensive.

632
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,750
So why don't we order those cars
closer to home?

633
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,595
What?

634
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,077
Did he understand us?

635
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,440
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Come on, Dino.

636
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,351
<i>Almost on my way.</i>
<i>See you at the gate.</i>

637
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,593
Now boarding for the flight to Las Vegas.

638
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,832
Listen, Ghalia, I'm busy.
You can't come now. It's important.

639
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,038
Dammit, that asshole!

640
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,708
Is he consulting Modena all the time?

641
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,239
<i>It failed! Get out of here!</i>

642
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,389
- What's he saying?
- Don't you know what 'decision' means?

643
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,630
Fine.

644
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,315
What's twenty cars, after all?

645
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,556
Hand me those contracts.

646
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,153
Can you take care of it?

647
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,634
Go in peace.

648
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,399
Go in peace.

649
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,429
Farid Ben Saoud!

650
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,394
What are you doing? Come on!

651
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,713
Asshole!

652
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,158
He's not Italian, he's Moroccan. OK?
I should have told you before. Sorry.

653
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,510
He's marrying your daughter.
A Moroccan!

654
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,109
All along he's been...

655
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,355
Are they the real ones?

656
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,469
Hello?

657
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,195
It's me. I'm on my way.

658
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,952
You sound stressed out.

659
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,119
No stress. I'm always tense
when I go on vacation. Nourdin!

660
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,718
Hold on. My dad's calling.

661
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,392
Don't hang up!

662
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,830
- What happened to your eye?
- I fell.

663
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,190
- You fell?
- No, I didn't fall.

664
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,960
- I'm not going to drive.
- Drive, drive, drive.

665
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,151
- In an M6?
- You've got your license, right?

666
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,679
Technically speaking, no.

667
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,475
- Dino, what's happening?
- I was talking to Nourdin.

668
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,477
- I really can't drive.
- Get in the car!

669
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,319
- I won't.
- Dammit, sit. Please.

670
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,155
We're leaving now.

671
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,316
Start!
We're coming.

672
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,158
- I'm hanging up. My dad's calling.
- Don't! I need to hear your voice.

673
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,554
We'll do crazy things in Las Vegas.

674
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,832
Step on it! Drive!

675
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,230
I'm talking to Nourdin.

676
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,751
The Grand Canyon?
That's high, right?

677
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,393
Good luck, Dino.

678
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,589
Hold on, babe.

679
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,394
Thanks. You've been a terrific help.

680
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,552
Farid. Nice to meet you.

681
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,909
I'm back.
We can go to Disney World too.

682
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,111
Have you ever been. It's terrific.

683
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,032
Or we can go to New Zealand.
New Zealand.

684
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,198
- Hey, buddy, wait your turn, OK?
- But my wife has already checked in.

685
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,719
What the fuck?

686
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,309
No, I wasn't talking to you.
Yes, I'm coming.

687
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,909
This gentleman was first.
Passport, please.

688
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,997
Thank you, madam.

689
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,108
Are you still there? Hello?

690
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,389
Hello?

691
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,548
Sir?

692
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,710
- Where are you going?
- Las Vegas.

693
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:40,117
- That flight is boarding now.
- Can't you make an exception?

694
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,357
My wife's checked in already.
We're getting married in Las Vegas.

695
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,596
- In Las Vegas?
- Yes.

696
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,113
How...

697
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,436
...do you say <i>cara</i> in Arabic?

698
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,439
<i>Habibi.</i>

699
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,835
You should have called me that
from the start.

700
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,833
Monique...

701
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,590
<i>Hi, you've reached Monique's</i>
<i>answering machine.</i>

702
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,069
Farid?

703
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,828
What happened?

704
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,395
What's wrong?

705
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,599
Where's dad?

706
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,753
Farid.

707
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,276
I'm so happy
you did the Ramadan for me.

708
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:36,274
It did me a lot of good.
I even gained a kilo.

709
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,917
- That makes me happy.
- Thank you.

710
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,114
But it didn't do you a lot of good, I see.

711
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,591
Come with me.

712
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,876
And then there's no way back.

713
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,312
They love you, but...

714
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,999
They love the other one more.

715
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,474
That Italian.

716
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,872
Dino Valentino.

717
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,672
Listen, Farid.

718
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,796
Never forget where you come from...

719
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,270
...or who you really are.

720
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,635
Yeah.

721
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,716
I'm proud of you.

722
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,318
Whoever you are.

723
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,271
You've never said that before.

724
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:45,235
Why would I bother you with that?
You know it, don't you?

725
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,949
- Can you say it again?
- Should I repeat it ten times?

726
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,153
Or has all that lying made you deaf?

727
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,515
Please...

728
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,711
I love you, son.

729
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,470
Just one more thing...

730
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,829
Don't tell me you're not only a liar...

731
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,316
...but a coward as well.

732
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,351
In order to make up with Monique...

733
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,759
...you'll have to find some way to do it.

734
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,672
Be a man.

735
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,110
Come.

736
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,795
Come on.

737
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,474
I sometimes wondered
when he was going to pop the question.

738
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,468
Six months ago he suddenly
showed up with this ring.

739
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,279
Thierry said: Let's take the leap.

740
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,398
Are you sure his name is Thierry?
Do you have proof?

741
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,874
Excuse me?

742
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,757
Oh, nothing. Sorry.

743
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,468
Is this the right place
for a wedding dress?

744
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,556
Sorry, I'll be right back.

745
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,240
Kind of remarkable that a man...

746
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,475
- ...is coming to look for a wedding dress.
- Yeah.

747
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,118
But my fiancée is remarkable.

748
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,196
She deserves the best there is.

749
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,276
When are you getting married?

750
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:37,839
I don't know yet.

751
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:49,078
- Isn't it handier if she picks one out?
- She doesn't know yet either.

752
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,909
- Oh, forced marriage.
- No.

753
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,999
No.

754
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,839
I...

755
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,389
I haven't been entirely honest to her.

756
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,319
I lied a bit to her and I...

757
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,518
- Lied a bit?
- No, I lied a lot.

758
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,029
- I was an ass.
- An ass?

759
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,749
Yes.

760
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:20,759
- I was an idiot.
- An idiot?

761
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,189
I...

762
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,758
I didn't know who I was anymore.

763
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,596
- Well, maybe it's better if I...
- No, stay.

764
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,755
He's leaving now.

765
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,472
Monique, please, I...

766
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,993
I know it's all my fault,
but I did it for you.

767
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,554
The way you smile and look at me...

768
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,115
How you poke me awake
when I'm snoring again...

769
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,153
How you plan
a weekend away together...

770
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,473
How you scare me jumping off a roof...

771
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,634
How you can pick things up
with your toes...

772
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,792
I was a stupid liar.

773
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,990
Stupid to think
it would be all right again.

774
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,794
I regret it.

775
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,597
It hurts so much.

776
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,950
Every day, every minute.

777
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,114
I do believe him.

778
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,958
I want you to leave.

779
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,238
I want you to leave now.

780
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,633
Could you hold this up?

781
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,754
Monique, I'm sorry.

782
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,919
Farid!

783
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,392
Do you, Monique Louwman...

784
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,876
...take Farid Ben Saoud to your
lawful wedded husband?

785
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,150
- How do you answer?
- Yes!

786
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,316
Do you, Farid Ben Saoud...

787
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,273
...take Monique Louwman
to your lawful wedded wife?

788
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:04,308
- How do you answer?
- Also yes!

789
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,520
I declare you husband and wife.

790
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,079
You first.
