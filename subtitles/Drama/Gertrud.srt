0
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000


1
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,538
Gertrud.

2
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,378
Gertrud.

3
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,219
You're still here.

4
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,962
I'm leaving in a moment.

5
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,566
Are you going to the office
tonight?

6
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,170
Yes - board meeting.

7
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:28,612
I'll probably go to the opera
and sit in my usual corner.

8
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,012
- What's playing?
- <i>Fidelio</i>.

9
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,854
Come here. Let's talk a bit.

10
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,248
- I have something to tell you.
- Yes?

11
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,550
I do. Has mother been
here today?

12
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:41,887
No.

13
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,992
She has to get
her monthly allowance.

14
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,997
Is that what you wanted
to tell me?

15
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,735
No. Come here. Sit down.

16
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,107
Tell me, Gertrud.

17
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,375
How would you like to be
a cabinet minister's wife?

18
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,745
Which cabinet minister
wants to marry me?

19
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,347
Minister Kanning.

20
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:14,621
That's the news. There's been talk
you'd be cabinet minister.

21
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,192
Yes.

22
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,226
You were never known as one of the
government's warmest supporters.

23
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,471
Not really, but I imagine
a little opposition

24
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,731
in the government
couldn't hurt.

25
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,904
And you'll be that
little opposition?

26
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,417
On the way home
I met the musical genius -

27
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,050
Erhard Jansson.
Isn't that his name?

28
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:47,189
<i>Erland</i> Jansson.
If that's who you mean.

29
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,429
Yes, yes. Erland Jansson.
Is he really a genius?

30
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,796
- That's what they say.
- But what do you think?

31
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,634
You know music so well.

32
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,972
- Do you know who I also met?
- No.

33
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:08,242
Gabriel Lidman.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

34
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,713
- I know that.
- I asked him to come visit us.

35
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,917
- Is he going to?
- That's what he said.

36
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,391
- He has been away a long time.
- Yes, 2 years.

37
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,586
- Three.
- There you go.

38
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,827
Here are some letters.
Bills, I suppose.

39
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,091
Thank you.

40
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,646
There's a picture of Lidman
in the newspaper.

41
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,382
May I see it?

42
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,153
It looks just like him.

43
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,823
Yes. He hasn't changed much.

44
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,297
Did you tell him that you're
giving the celebration speech?

45
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,941
He knew already.

46
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,875
I look forward to
seeing him again.

47
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,015
Why did you break it off
with him?

48
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,711
Let's not talk about it.

49
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,218
No, no - that chapter of your
life has been forgotten.

50
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,831
You said it's over
and I believe you.

51
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,666
I've always thought your
relationship to Gabriel

52
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,840
was not my concern.

53
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,167
You were a free
and independent woman.

54
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:49,173
You were an artist
and he was a famous poet.

55
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,949
- It's another story.
- Is it?

56
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,318
Yes, of course.
What are you laughing about?

57
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,259
I'm just smiling, thinking about
all the poor human beings

58
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,624
who allow themselves to love,

59
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:11,498
whether they're artists
or famous people or not.

60
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,811
Have you seen my large
briefcase?

61
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,312
Yes. It's out in the hall.

62
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,047
Thank you.

63
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,841
How beautiful you are,
Gertrud.

64
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,151
I got this mirror from
Gabriel Lidman.

65
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,023
It should have been in the
bedroom, so that I would have

66
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,353
something to look at
when I woke in the morning.

67
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,622
- Yes, that's what he said.
- Yes, I know.

68
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:15,696
Later I received something else
from him - a bit less rococo -

69
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,268
and now his mirror hangs here -
with you - in your room.

70
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,067
May I kiss you, Gertrud?

71
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,990
- It gets dark early now.
- I should probably go.

72
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,866
I seek your lips and
you give me your cheek

73
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,962
and the door to your room
has been locked up to me

74
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,730
for more than a month.

75
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,965
I used to be welcome there.

76
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,745
I often lie awake,
thinking of you.

77
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,315
I've thought you might be in love
with someone else

78
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,809
and I've wondered who
it could be.

79
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,945
Damn it. Mamma's here.

80
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,855
Good afternoon.

81
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,293
- Good afternoon, Gustav.
- Good afternoon, little Mamma.

82
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,404
Those stairs!
Good afternoon, sweet Gertrud.

83
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,869
Good afternoon, mother-in-law.

84
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:36,676
- Come and sit down.
- Thank you.

85
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,214
- Mamma, you're late today.
- I was snoozing over a book.

86
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,686
Even when you're old,
you still like to keep up.

87
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,419
- What was the book?
- What was it... I've forgotten.

88
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,257
- Who wrote it?
- I don't remember,

89
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,763
but it was an artistic book.

90
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,630
- What was it about?
- God knows. I've forgotten.

91
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,362
Not that I understand what
they write these days.

92
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,271
Would you like a cup of tea,
mother-in-law?

93
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,409
Thank you, my sweet.
I'd rather have a glass of port.

94
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:06,078
- Gladly.
- Thank you.

95
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,112
Dear Gertrud, she is truly a
sweet and good wife to you.

96
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:18,449
- Yes, she is.
- I tell that to everyone.

97
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,123
- Do people ask you?
- Ask? No one asks.

98
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,319
But people gossip, you know.

99
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:30,993
Since you've been married, not a
soul has said a word against her.

100
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,095
Up 'til now in any case.

101
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,876
And that old story with her
and him... what was his name?

102
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,411
- Lidman.
- That was just gossip, of course.

103
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,843
Of course.

104
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:50,180
They say you're going to be
a cabinet minister?

105
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,851
That's what they say.

106
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,285
What does one
get a year for that?

107
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,824
One has to sacrifice for
one's country.

108
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,795
Bless you. You'll regret it.

109
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,834
Think of your father, my son,
think of what he sacrificed.

110
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:09,270
What did he get out of it?
A couple of medals.

111
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:13,536
No, Gustav, mind your law firm
and stop thinking

112
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,941
of the fatherland.
That's my advice.

113
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,414
Mamma, I'll become a cabinet
minister because I want to.

114
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,021
Gertrud's coming to the
court ball, isn't she?

115
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,483
She's completely
indifferent to it.

116
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,394
- If you please.
- Thank you.

117
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:02,317
What do you think about becoming
a cabinet minister's wife?

118
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:05,292
What shall I say,
it hasn't been decided yet.

119
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,829
The Minister of State will call
at five o'clock.

120
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,095
Listen, let's not forget,
you have to have your money.

121
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,362
I'll get it.

122
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:16,970
Can't you get
your mother to go?

123
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,838
I've something I want to discuss
with you, something serious.

124
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,247
Mamma dear, unfortunately,
I have a meeting

125
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,918
and Gertrud has to leave.

126
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,653
It's past four-thirty.
And I have so much to do.

127
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,293
Listen, you didn't get
your money.

128
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:42,163
- Thank you. Goodbye, Gustav.
- Goodbye, Mamma.

129
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,369
Goodbye, little Gertrud.

130
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,072
Goodbye, mother-in-law.

131
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,679
What's on your mind?

132
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,697
Something I wanted to tell you
for a long time

133
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,763
and I dare not put it off
any longer.

134
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,136
This will hurt you.

135
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,304
Gustav, I'll not be a cabinet
minister's wife.

136
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,502
What are you saying?

137
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,311
I no longer
want to be your wife.

138
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,413
Gertrud, what do you mean?

139
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,053
Remember what you said when
you gave me the ring.

140
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,054
If the day ever came when one
of us wanted to be free,

141
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,796
then the other must step aside.

142
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:53,031
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, I remember.

143
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,008
I felt a little sorrow then.

144
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:02,981
I thought we should be together
our entire lives.

145
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,513
When I saw how much
you loved me,

146
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:12,282
I came to you and said
I would be yours.

147
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,156
I wouldn't have had it any
other way for the whole world.

148
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,590
And now you want to leave me.

149
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,027
Gertrud, I don't understand.

150
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:31,769
Gustav. So much has changed.
We've changed.

151
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,773
I love you, Gertrud.

152
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:42,753
Love - such a big word.

153
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,853
There's so much you love.

154
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,686
You love power and honor,
you love yourself,

155
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,196
your intellectual life,
your books,

156
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,334
your Havana cigars,

157
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,036
and I am sure you loved me
at times.

158
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,450
How can you say such a thing?

159
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,048
You know,

160
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,433
when we sit here in the evening,

161
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,736
do you realize you can sit
for hours on end,

162
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:35,066
staring into space
without saying a word?

163
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,701
I have many things
to think about.

164
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:43,071
- Things?
- Yes, my cases, my work.

165
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,509
Your work. There we have it,

166
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,488
you think about your work.

167
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,623
- You believe it is indifference?
- It's worse than indifference.

168
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,288
It's a lack of feeling.

169
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,400
A woman loves her husband
above all,

170
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:08,568
but for him, work comes first.

171
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,935
Isn't that the nature
of the universe?

172
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:17,274
Naturally, it's a man's
nature to work, to create.

173
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:22,520
But work mustn't exile
the woman from his thoughts.

174
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,926
I feel this way often, as if I
have no husband at all,

175
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,794
as if I'm just atmosphere
for you.

176
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,863
What more do you want to get
off your chest?

177
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:44,674
That you, in a very
humiliating way, show me

178
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,045
how little I mean to you.

179
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,339
Am I absolutely nothing to you?

180
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:57,679
You never guess my wishes
or my thoughts.

181
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:03,793
Whether I am happy or sad
is completely uninteresting to you.

182
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:10,925
I understand your reproach for
being absorbed in my work.

183
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:17,970
The man I'm with
must be completely mine.

184
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,970
I must come before everything.

185
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:30,746
I don't want to be
an occasional plaything.

186
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,857
Yes but, sweet Gertrud,
love alone

187
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,222
is not enough in a man's life.

188
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,195
That would be ridiculous
for a man.

189
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:46,763
Perhaps it would,

190
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:53,006
but see for yourself
how little I mean to you

191
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:59,216
and how insignificant the void
becomes when I leave now.

192
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:06,321
Gertrud, what are you hiding
from me?

193
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,359
Is there someone else?

194
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,869
You may call it that,
if you want.

195
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:27,838
- Then you're admitting it.
- Yes.

196
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:36,312
- Has it already happened?
- No.

197
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,080
But it will happen then?

198
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,294
Gertrud, you're
driving me crazy.

199
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:52,036
Oh, no. The woman that can drive
you crazy doesn't exist.

200
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,030
You don't believe that either.

201
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,349
Who is he?

202
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,754
You don't think I'd answer that,
do you?

203
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,721
Is it someone who wants
to marry you?

204
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:20,992
Perhaps I will sing again
as before and fend for myself.

205
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,634
Gertrud - Who is it?

206
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:35,337
I can only tell you that he
doesn't belong to our circle.

207
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,447
Where did you meet him?

208
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,585
Gertrud.

209
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:53,726
Will you leave
and not come back?

210
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,136
No, my friend, but I feel
I had to tell you now.

211
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,844
We can speak again about
the how and why,

212
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,973
but tomorrow we have to go
to the celebration.

213
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,992
If you could just explain how
this has happened.

214
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,326
Things are easier
when one understands.

215
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:30,601
What more can I explain?
I don't understand it myself.

216
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:39,877
All I know is that love
has me in its clutches.

217
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:45,683
And it doesn't mean anything
to you to tell me this?

218
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,478
It's as if you're resigning
a position.

219
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:55,718
I have suffered day and night,
wondering how I should tell you.

220
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,531
Gertrud - I can't take this.

221
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,265
You took it easier than
I had feared.

222
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,112
It went easier for both of us.

223
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,284
And where will you go now?

224
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:28,388
As I've told you - tonight
I'm going to the opera.

225
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,061
Goodbye, Gustav.

226
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,681
- Have you been waiting long?
- Yes, too long.

227
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,152
Forgive me, darling.

228
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,119
I'll try.

229
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,635
Do you love me?

230
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,574
You have to say it.

231
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,847
- I love you.
- Say it again.

232
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,547
I love you.

233
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,536
I love you.

234
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,117
We must talk seriously
about this.

235
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,358
What I can ever be to you?

236
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,533
Let me go my way.
I can never be yours anyway.

237
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,966
You are everything to me,

238
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,766
- my life of desire and sorrow.
- Sorrow?

239
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,945
Yes, much to my sorrow I must
love you as I do,

240
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:31,616
though I don't understand you.

241
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,718
I'm nothing more than
a whim for you.

242
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,487
You sent me roses.

243
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,626
That was after
your first concert,

244
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,191
two roses and a card,

245
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:50,229
and I never received an answer -
not one bit of thanks.

246
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,098
But I still received more roses.

247
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:59,702
And when we met... Remember
our first kiss?

248
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,643
I remember many kisses,
a rain of kisses,

249
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,917
kisses that went through
my bones,

250
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,782
kisses that made me gasp
for breath.

251
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:14,523
I couldn't get you out
of my mind.

252
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:19,388
When I saw you at the concert
I had to have you.

253
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,858
And when I ask you to be mine
completely, you retreat

254
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,795
and yet you still say I mean
everything to you.

255
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:32,300
It is you, and do you know
how you became so?

256
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,573
I had never heard your voice.

257
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,817
I had to hear you speak to know
whether it was you I had to love.

258
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,144
So I went to see you.

259
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,190
I wonder how I had the courage.

260
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,057
Lucky I was home.

261
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,692
<i>Yes, come in.

262
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:51,448
<i>Eternal winged child and god

263
00:24:51,890 --> 00:25:04,166
<i>Once again my heart
obeys your stern call

264
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:11,302
<i>Yes again I've become lonely

265
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:17,574
<i>in the midst
of your satisfied flock

266
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:24,713
<i>Here your ardent harshness

267
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:32,496
<i>may yet bring me happiness

268
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:47,868
<i>Darkness has formed a pearl

269
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,845
<i>Night has borne a dream

270
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:02,789
<i>Hidden shall I reside within

271
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:09,093
<i>Dazzling, white and tender

272
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:15,236
<i>The song must sound in the heart

273
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:22,046
<i>Painfully sweet and cruel

274
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:29,080
<i>While my sparkling pearl

275
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:37,351
<i>Grows in its dark room

276
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:06,651
How beautifully you sang. As if I
had never heard the song before.

277
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,156
I'm tired.

278
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,991
I was out on the town
last night.

279
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,399
As usual. Is that necessary
to be an artist?

280
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,475
I don't know. I know only
that I have to.

281
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,378
Some of us wasted away
the night together.

282
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,576
We ended up at a bar where
we played cards

283
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,810
with a couple of con men.
They took all our money.

284
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,457
Nice types - well -
poetic justice.

285
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,990
Did you play too?

286
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:47,555
I sat mostly, half-asleep, and
meanwhile worked on a motif.

287
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,769
I still have it in my head.

288
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,031
I could make a symphony
out of it,

289
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,269
if I could pull myself together.

290
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:04,271
You shouldn't go out like that.
You're destroying yourself.

291
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,943
You'll stay home tonight,
won't you?

292
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,615
- I've been invited out.
- With whom?

293
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:16,719
A guy I know. He's arranged an
apartment for a girl he likes.

294
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,987
Her name is Constance.

295
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,934
It'll be christened this
evening. I'm going.

296
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,131
Don't go.

297
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:26,599
Why shouldn't I?

298
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,339
Because I'm asking you not to.

299
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,873
I also asked you something once
that you could've given me.

300
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,214
Erland, there's so much music
in you that wants to get out

301
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:43,187
into the world,
out among people.

302
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,822
The way you live, it'll die,
perhaps soon,

303
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,889
perhaps sooner than you think.

304
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:54,632
Your inspirations from a smelly
bar after a sleepless night -

305
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,893
Erland, they're worthless.

306
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,662
Erland - I beg you -

307
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:05,400
beg you as if I were begging
for my life. Don't go.

308
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:08,670
I live as I want and must live.

309
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,674
It's in my blood.

310
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,149
Even if I did promise you to
stay home, I'd go anyway.

311
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:19,118
Then it is better
that you promise nothing.

312
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,189
I live hard because I like to.

313
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,261
Tomorrow is a new beginning.

314
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:29,833
Gabriel Lidman the great poet,
has returned home

315
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,170
and will be honored tomorrow.

316
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:39,175
He turns 50 as if it were
some feat to turn 50.

317
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,009
So we'll see each other.
I'll be there too.

318
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,380
- Is your husband coming as well?
- Yes.

319
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,248
The politician.

320
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,359
And now he'll be
a cabinet minister.

321
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,827
Why does he bother?

322
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,957
You're speaking about a man
you don't know.

323
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,760
I'm sorry.

324
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:09,096
Before I left home, I had
a long talk with him.

325
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,436
That's why you had to wait.

326
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:17,838
Today I have set myself free.
Now I am a free woman.

327
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,550
- Does that mean?
- Yes.

328
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:27,654
You said I could never
be yours...

329
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:31,186
but Erland, I can be.

330
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,729
From now on I'm
completely yours.

331
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:46,101
- I dreamt something last night.
- What did you dream?

332
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,608
I was running naked through
the streets, dogs chasing me.

333
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,681
And when they caught me,
I awoke.

334
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:03,817
And I realized we two are
completely alone in the world.

335
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,836
Give me your mouth.

336
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:35,157
Your wonderful mouth.

337
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,494
Where do we go now?

338
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:43,490
Your place. Come.

339
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:43,326
Gertrud. Do you dare?

340
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,261
I mean, if...

341
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:55,203
Erland - I love you, Erland,

342
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,632
and if you ask me if I dare,

343
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:04,839
then I will answer you,
yes, I dare.

344
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,778
I dare for I believe in you.

345
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:11,820
Do you care about me?

346
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:18,588
I can never, never care
about anyone else.

347
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:33,376
I just couldn't imagine living
not having been with you.

348
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,980
Strange woman.

349
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,170
Who are you, really?

350
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:09,504
- I am many things.
- Who?

351
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:17,320
The morning dew, dripping from
the leaves of the tree.

352
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:26,622
White clouds sailing
where, no one knows.

353
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,230
Who else are you?

354
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:34,598
I am the moon. I am the sky.

355
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,767
And what else?

356
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,040
Yes, I am a mouth.

357
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:47,676
A mouth seeking another's mouth.

358
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,015
Sounds like a dream.

359
00:34:53,558 --> 00:35:00,020
It is a dream. Life is a dream.

360
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,591
- Life?
- Yes.

361
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:12,340
Life is a long, long chain
of dreams,

362
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:16,711
drifting into one another.

363
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:21,816
- And the mouth you spoke of?
- A dream.

364
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,419
And the mouth you seek?

365
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,958
Also a dream.

366
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,277
Play something.

367
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,756
- What shall I play?
- A nocturne.

368
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,093
Debussy's.

369
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,523
No, your own.

370
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,827
<i>Coming home from the office
so many thoughts

371
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,462
<i>raced through my head.

372
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,958
<i>How a person can dream
his life away,

373
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,838
<i>while others busily rush around.

374
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,307
<i>Slowly and helplessly,
life slips through our hands,

375
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,507
<i>whatever we do.

376
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:09,951
<i>I thought how the dearest and
sweetest in my own life

377
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:13,422
<i>was now slipping
through my hands

378
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,555
<i>without my being able
to understand why

379
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,923
<i>or explain how it had happened.

380
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:24,297
<i>I was reminded of an old verse.
It went:

381
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,636
<i>"Pay attention to the treasure
God has sent you,

382
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,574
<i>don't let it slip through
your hands."

383
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,945
<i>We're never attentive enough

384
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,309
<i>to what we possess
and loathe to lose.

385
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,515
<i>I longed for my wife,

386
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,752
<i>longed to walk again side-by-side
through the streets

387
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,115
<i>with her arms in mine,

388
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,417
<i>as so many times before

389
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:53,162
<i>when we were happy.

390
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:58,566
<i>Then I thought I'd go meet her
at the opera.

391
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,730
May I help you with something?

392
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,938
I am here to pick up my wife.

393
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,835
She may have left
before the last act.

394
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,506
Mrs. Kanning was not here
at all this evening.

395
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:47,039
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I've been here all evening.

396
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:51,254
- Do you know my wife?
- I should know your wife.

397
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,751
She has sung here.

398
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,425
There you are.

399
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,397
Oh, Erland

400
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,605
here, with you, I'm alive again.

401
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,514
I can't tell you
how happy I am.

402
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,585
- Are you quite yourself again?
- Yes.

403
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,953
Now we shall live together.

404
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,088
Do you think we could live
together?

405
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:07,223
I love you. Erland

406
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:12,002
all my love awaits you now.

407
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,197
Gertrud.

408
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,531
Erland.

409
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,637
You'll not go to Constance's
party now, will you?

410
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,564
In Florabakken.

411
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:52,663
<i>Lights ablaze today we carry

412
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:56,822
<i>The fire burns clearly
as your words

413
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:01,164
<i>Our torches burn in your honor

414
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:05,035
<i>Be welcomed to your native soil.

415
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:09,402
<i>See us hoist the golden candles

416
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:13,550
<i>Widely traveled, lofty free spirit.

417
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,843
<i>Hear our pleas from the
young hearts of the nation

418
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:21,684
<i>Give us new works from your hand

419
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:26,319
<i>Lights ablaze today we carry

420
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,523
<i>The fire burns clearly
as words of truth

421
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:34,831
<i>Our free thoughts are our honor

422
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,873
<i>We'll fight proudly
for all we believe

423
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:43,169
<i>We will exorcize the power
of winter's might

424
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:47,340
<i>That's the goal for our future

425
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:51,544
<i>See us emerge from the
paths of life

426
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:55,453
<i>Amid hope's beautiful fiery glow.

427
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:15,311
Dear Gabriel Lidman.

428
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:20,947
We are gathered here on behalf
of the students and youth

429
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:24,946
to honor you as the great
poet of love.

430
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:30,287
Most young people today have
been raised by parents

431
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,759
who were married in church
and lived an ordinary life,

432
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,465
a life having nothing
to do with love.

433
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,466
These past generations' idea
of sexuality

434
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:45,040
as something sordid
and simple,

435
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,944
has always been foreign to you.

436
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:51,473
Their doctrine of love
is that true love

437
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:59,013
is only thinkable with a union
of heart and mind.

438
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:03,584
Your hymns to love describe
two people completely devoted

439
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:06,729
to each other in a love-giving
and intimate life

440
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:13,564
together, in perfect warmth
and tenderness.

441
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,629
Let me cite the following lines:

442
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,376
"He held fast to her mouth,

443
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,673
"still deeper they sank
into each other.

444
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:29,911
"He felt as if he were
on a journey in space

445
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:35,114
"in the white moonlight,
a red star, first faint

446
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:40,729
"and about to end,
then stronger and closer.

447
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:45,291
"It grew and enlarged into
a flaming well of fire.

448
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,663
"He burned without pain
and the flames

449
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:52,342
"swallowed his tongue
like sour wine."

450
00:46:54,678 --> 00:47:01,413
In erotic ecstasy, people find
infinity and eternity.

451
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:07,048
This is the greatest part of
your erotic idea.

452
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:11,222
This is love without borders.

453
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:17,591
To this idea of love, all
humankind is created and called.

454
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:41,150
Two things for me
have always been

455
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,758
and still are more important
than anything else:

456
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:49,222
these two things are
Love and Thought.

457
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:55,697
You've spoken about love.

458
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:03,012
As far as thoughts go,
we should have courage

459
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,808
to think good thoughts,

460
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:10,749
for good thoughts bring us
to the summit of truth,

461
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:15,516
and truth is the only thing
worthwhile.

462
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:21,122
This thinking can lead
to the truth,

463
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:27,668
pure truth without
predisposition.

464
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,804
In your search for this truth,

465
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:39,844
be true to yourselves
and don't compromise.

466
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,854
Have courage to think
good thoughts.

467
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,850
Remember the words of the
French philosopher:

468
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:54,591
"A true soul need not hide
his thoughts."

469
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:57,432
Thank you.

470
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,587
<i>Yes, we are coming -
listen to our voices

471
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,664
<i>You shall know, your words
have weight

472
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:34,003
<i>Speak strong and clear,
so no one forgets

473
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:38,004
<i>the fight for the nation's
new open generation

474
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:42,470
<i>Our minds are young
and full of vigor,

475
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,616
<i>pure wills made from hard steel

476
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,548
<i>We shall reach every goal
for which we strive

477
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:55,316
<i>Show us the way to yet
greater goals

478
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:06,364
Honorable Vice-Chancellor.
Ladies and gentlemen.

479
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:12,434
It is a great honor to be asked
to give a speech tonight

480
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,439
in tribute to my old friend
Gabriel Lidman.

481
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:20,548
Gabriel Lidman is the aristocrat
among our poets.

482
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,711
The most outstanding trait in
his character is honesty,

483
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:29,221
honesty in the great
and the small.

484
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:35,062
He derides the mediocre,
even when it hides

485
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,961
beneath a noble
and proper veneer.

486
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:43,700
His essence is curiosity,
captivating curiosity

487
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,509
in his exceedingly
subdued appearance.

488
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:52,348
When he speaks,
it is with such tranquillity,

489
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,878
one is forced to listen.

490
00:50:57,021 --> 00:50:59,148
He never becomes pathetic.

491
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,255
Do you feel all right?

492
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:06,057
The torches make it
warm here.

493
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:09,924
His speech can be colored with
light but caustic irony

494
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:12,796
which does not sting.

495
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:16,806
He loves stillness,

496
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:21,940
inspirational stillness...

497
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:23,638
Do you feel ill?

498
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:29,909
Lidman has cultivated
succinctness as an artistic form.

499
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,786
He never writes a word too many.

500
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:42,324
Each sentence is well considered
and as sharp as a razor.

501
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:48,864
He shuns vague speech,
sentimentality,

502
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,007
false pathos and the
unextraordinary.

503
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,108
You can sit here undisturbed.

504
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:58,648
Would you like the door
to the main hall closed?

505
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:01,851
Yes, please close it.

506
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:10,317
A Professor Nygren wishes
to see Mrs. Kanning.

507
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,028
- Is that you, Axel?
- Yes.

508
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:24,240
- I thought you were in Paris.
- I was,

509
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,604
but I had an errand here at home,
then Lidman. You understand.

510
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,572
It was nice of you to come
on a sick call.

511
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:33,215
Yes, I heard you had a
terrible headache.

512
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:35,408
Look here. I have some
perfectly splendid tablets

513
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,952
that take away headaches -
though they're large.

514
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,317
- What kind are they?
- They're a Viennese concoction.

515
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:44,686
- From Paris?
- Yes, all of Paris knows them.

516
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,263
You can hold the powder. Could I
get a glass of cold water?

517
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,126
Of course.
I'll get it from there.

518
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:56,800
Professor Nygren is here,
go back to the celebration.

519
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,400
Fine, if Mrs. Kanning thinks so.
Then...

520
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,306
Yes, and I am most grateful
for your care.

521
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,508
It was my pleasure to be
of assistance.

522
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,086
Thank you.

523
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:13,750
Thank you.

524
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,272
Well?

525
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,240
Just think,
I already feel better.

526
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:44,985
Axel, it is so good to see you
again. You have not changed.

527
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:49,083
Neither have you
the same magic illumination.

528
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:54,159
The last time we spoke
you were working on a book.

529
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,855
Yes. On free will.
I'm still working on it.

530
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,598
I'm glad you still believe
in free will.

531
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,168
My father was a sad fatalist.

532
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,705
He taught us that everything
in life is predetermined.

533
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:17,416
I remember what you said
will is a choice.

534
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,122
But my father said there's
no such thing as choice.

535
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:28,162
One doesn't choose, he said, not
his wife or his children.

536
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,266
One gets them and one has them,
but doesn't choose them.

537
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,527
Fate decides everything.

538
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:36,096
Then you know your life's
destiny.

539
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,469
I'll choose my own husbands.
Thank you.

540
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:45,211
- Plural?
- Yes. You were in Paris.

541
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:50,710
- What did you do down there?
- Studied.

542
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:53,115
- Psychology?
- Yes, and psychiatry.

543
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,120
Lots of things are happening
in those fields.

544
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,619
- It must be exciting.
- It is. Some of us meet

545
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,525
in the evening and work
further on our own.

546
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,897
- How?
- We hypnotize each other,

547
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,731
we experiment with thought
transference,

548
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:12,407
and we've found a lady
who has a sixth sense.

549
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,304
We're really happy
to have her around.

550
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:17,706
Otherwise, we discuss and argue
until we're blue in the face.

551
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:20,676
- About what?
- Everything possible.

552
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,481
Psychoses and neuroses,
dreams and symbols.

553
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,085
How I envy you.

554
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:31,754
Come to Paris and join
our group. You'd like it.

555
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,694
I'm sure I would, but -

556
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:49,846
That, that's the dream I had
the other night.

557
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:05,789
Attorney Kanning
has finished his speech,

558
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:08,163
so he'll be here any moment.

559
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,602
It was nice to see you again,
Axel.

560
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,800
It's too bad you have
to go back so soon.

561
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,641
Good gracious.
Gertrud, you look better now.

562
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,810
I feel much better now,

563
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:33,489
thanks to some wonderful pills
Axel gave me.

564
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,721
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

565
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:37,450
The important thing is that
they helped.

566
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:43,132
- Goodbye and be well!
- Goodbye, Axel.

567
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,768
Hope to see you again soon.

568
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:16,193
I have to speak to you,
now that we're alone.

569
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:25,839
Last night when I came home
your door was locked.

570
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:29,476
- I must have slept well.
- That's impossible.

571
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,810
Why?

572
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:33,615
I took a cab home from
the opera.

573
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,443
Were you at the opera?

574
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:42,221
That's not what you'd say
if you had known

575
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,258
that I too was at the opera?
Right?

576
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,560
You say nothing.
Do you know why?

577
00:57:54,738 --> 00:57:56,467
Because you don't want to lie.

578
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:02,070
You weren't at the opera,
nor were you home.

579
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,849
Why do we have to talk
about this? Do we have to?

580
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:14,718
Yes, we do, you should know
I went to the opera

581
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:17,926
not to spy on you but because
I longed for you

582
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:23,861
and was sick with the thought
of your leaving me.

583
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,899
I beg you,
please don't say more.

584
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:35,669
Answer me, Gertrud.
Where were you yesterday?

585
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,748
Gustav, after our talk
yesterday,

586
00:58:41,485 --> 00:58:44,682
you must understand your
question is meaningless.

587
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:49,084
I'm your husband, Gertrud.

588
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,291
I am still your husband.

589
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:58,863
I don't know you any longer.
Is that you, speaking this way?

590
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:05,198
You made a fool out of me
yesterday at the opera.

591
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,335
You already knew what you were
going to do.

592
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:13,982
Yes, I knew what I was
going to do.

593
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,481
I fooled you to spare you.

594
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:24,649
Not out of cowardice or
treachery. You know I'm truthful.

595
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,662
Yes, God knows.

596
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,500
No woman should be so honest.

597
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:38,466
But I won't let you go,
you can believe that.

598
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:44,606
Will you lock me up?
Be reasonable.

599
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:54,181
You'll be with me tonight.
Our last night.

600
00:59:57,394 --> 01:00:01,626
Then you can go wherever
you choose

601
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:11,500
and ruin your life,

602
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,944
if that's what you wish.

603
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:24,683
You don't know what you're
saying. I'm going in to rest.

604
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:51,009
Well, here you are.
How is Gertrud?

605
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,546
She felt ill but she's
better now.

606
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,114
Let's hear about you.

607
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:01,754
How does it feel to be
home again?

608
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:03,548
On your native soil.

609
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:07,119
Oh, yes - the native soil of
the fatherland

610
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,390
is all well and good -
I mean the earth,

611
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,296
the air, the fields and forests,
but the people,

612
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,061
Kanning, the people - damn!

613
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:19,807
I ended up in mixed company
last night,

614
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,605
somewhat mixed company,
one ought to say.

615
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:28,312
Well, it doesn't matter.
I was out to enjoy myself.

616
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,043
So, I shouldn't take it too
seriously. Better to laugh it off.

617
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,533
What is it we were talking about?
Oh yes, listen.

618
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,261
I want to go back to Rome.
I can't work up there.

619
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:52,339
I hear you'll be a
cabinet minister.

620
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:57,838
It sure looks like it, if you
believe the newspapers.

621
01:01:58,248 --> 01:02:02,048
You have to. You have to believe
in something in this world.

622
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:09,881
Attorney Kanning - the Vice-
Chancellor would like a word.

623
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,524
I'm coming.

624
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,959
Come sit here.

625
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:58,933
You're still young and pure,
like a bride.

626
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,317
The light is hurting my eyes.

627
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:34,534
You look as if something
unpleasant has happened to you.

628
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:39,613
Yes. I was in bad company last
evening, but it was my own fault.

629
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,208
I don't want to think about it.
It's over.

630
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,183
Everything is nothing.

631
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:51,751
In the old days you always
spoke of your life's work.

632
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,224
You've become a great and
famous man,

633
01:03:56,433 --> 01:04:00,164
and now everything is nothing.

634
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,265
What's the matter, Gabriel?

635
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:08,839
Oh, I'm feeling old.

636
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:16,312
Can you tell me, Gertrud,
why did I come back here?

637
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,717
I was just going to ask you
the same question.

638
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:26,084
There was a kind of homesickness,
especially for one street,

639
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,256
a street I often thought about.

640
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,799
One spring day I walked down
that street and wept

641
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,663
in the midst of the sunshine.

642
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:41,440
Yes, I've often wept.
It's not so bad.

643
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,505
It eases you.

644
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:50,452
Let's speak of happier things.

645
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,484
You've come home a hero.

646
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:56,452
A hero? Yes, yes,

647
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,389
I dare say we're probably not
talking about the same thing.

648
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:05,131
In the only battle I ever cared about,
I was defeated.

649
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:11,102
Gertrud, why did you leave me?

650
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,310
We shouldn't talk about it now.

651
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:19,312
As I said before, I was in
bad company last evening.

652
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:22,983
I ate lunch with an old
school friend and it ended up

653
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:27,646
with someone asking us to go
to a little party

654
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:31,190
at his girlfriend's -
Constance.

655
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:35,622
- In Florabakken.
- How did you know?

656
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:42,232
Oh, I've heard about her.
The city is not so large.

657
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:47,769
No. Well, I went with them.

658
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:51,378
Holier men than I have sat at
the table of a courtesan.

659
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:58,480
Well, what else happened?
Now I am curious.

660
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:13,334
What are they playing?
What are we listening to now?

661
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:18,573
"Song in the night" by
Erland Jansson.

662
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:22,144
Of course, I heard it in Rome.

663
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:25,814
I remember I was
completely moved

664
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:29,075
when I noticed in the program the
composer was a fellow countryman.

665
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:30,976
It's a lovely melody.

666
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:34,655
Yes, it is beautiful.

667
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:42,961
Wasn't Erland Jansson supposed
to play here this evening?

668
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:48,470
That was the talk, but I
don't care. I don't like him.

669
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:54,403
- You know him?
- Yes, unfortunately.

670
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,302
I wish I didn't.

671
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:04,249
Where did you meet him?
I know him, too.

672
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:12,894
Gertrud, Gertrud.
Why did you leave me?

673
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:19,225
Listen, now you're getting off
the subject.

674
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,029
You wanted to tell me about
last night's party.

675
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,571
I met Erland Jansson last night.

676
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:32,476
He showed up late in the night.

677
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:39,579
You didn't mind sitting
at a courtesan's table.

678
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,190
Why should he?

679
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:45,623
No, naturally -
but I don't like him.

680
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,625
He boasts about things
others keep to themselves.

681
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,796
- Such as?
- He bragged about his lovers.

682
01:07:56,706 --> 01:08:00,233
No, that wasn't nice.

683
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:07,813
No. In this mixed company,

684
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:12,010
in this atmosphere of drinking,
playing and whoring around,

685
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:16,049
he spoke aloud
of his last conquest.

686
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:24,463
And he named her,
her beloved name.

687
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:46,287
Gertrud, was I wrong to
tell you this?

688
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:55,154
I don't know.
I don't understand.

689
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,799
I know nothing.

690
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:02,266
I felt I had to, Gertrud.
I had to - had to.

691
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:06,568
You had to.

692
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:16,318
Gabriel, help me understand
all this.

693
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:20,983
I don't understand it myself.
I only understand what I do -

694
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,549
should have done.

695
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:27,052
This I don't understand.

696
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:30,091
He must have been ill.

697
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:34,326
Well, I don't believe so.
It was so horrible of him.

698
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,902
But he was drunk,
and he's so young.

699
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:41,599
Yes, he is so young.

700
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:44,644
And he belongs to a
completely different circle.

701
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:47,811
Yes, yes.

702
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:54,218
Gertrud, now you'll break it off
with him?

703
01:09:55,391 --> 01:10:00,590
I love him. I love him.

704
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:05,390
- That's madness, Gertrud.
- Yes.

705
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:12,371
And no one can advise you,
no one can help you?

706
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:19,880
No. I've known all along
it was madness,

707
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:25,953
but I had so little to lose,
Gabriel.

708
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:32,720
My life was so terribly
lonely and empty.

709
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:55,716
Last night my life was
shattered

710
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,351
when I heard the one I loved
more than anything -

711
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,552
when I heard her name dragged
through the mud

712
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,819
by a reckless young man -

713
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:09,597
one suddenly feels old.

714
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:16,895
Gertrud, I'd never thought
we'd meet again this way.

715
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,132
Nothing happens like
we think it should.

716
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:27,481
How do you think it should,
Gabriel?

717
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,469
Gabriel,

718
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:59,411
Gabriel, don't take it so hard.

719
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:20,836
No. No, don't leave me
this way.

720
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:39,945
Gertrud - the Vice-Chancellor
asked me to say hello

721
01:12:40,156 --> 01:12:42,716
and that he hoped to hear you
sing this evening.

722
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,390
And what did you tell him?

723
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:49,529
I said I would try to convince you
to sing a song or two

724
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:52,665
but I didn't promise anything.

725
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:58,136
Yes, I would like to.
Where?

726
01:12:58,607 --> 01:12:59,801
In here.

727
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,468
Shall I have accompaniment?

728
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:05,712
Mr. Erland Jansson has
agreed to do it.

729
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,278
- But there's no piano here?
- It's in there.

730
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:12,954
I'll take care of it.

731
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:00,560
Over there.

732
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,737
Many thanks.

733
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:16,142
<i>I'm not angry
even if my heart is broken

734
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:21,379
<i>In the midst of my hopelessness

735
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:25,151
<i>I see how cruelly you suffered

736
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:33,799
<i>and no anger, and no anger.

737
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:38,335
<i>Even though your brow
gives a youthful glow

738
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:42,477
<i>I know how heavy your heart is

739
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:46,205
<i>I've known it for a long time.

740
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:56,783
<i>I'm not angry,
my eternally lost friend.

741
01:15:39,502 --> 01:15:42,938
- Have you been waiting long?
- Just a few minutes.

742
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,706
I couldn't come sooner.

743
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,881
You don't look well.

744
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:01,779
I know, but I had to speak
to you anyway.

745
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:11,866
Tell me, why did you collapse
last night?

746
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:18,196
I was overtired, from having
quarrelled with my husband.

747
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:23,303
- Was he cruel towards you?
- How could you think that?

748
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,877
I mean, if he loves you,
he'll be hurt if you leave him.

749
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,950
It's not his nature
to be cruel.

750
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:39,084
Well, I hardly know him.
He seems fairly nice.

751
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,155
What do you have
against him anyway?

752
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:49,669
Why do you want to divorce him?

753
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:51,840
We could be good friends
just as well.

754
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:59,440
Erland, I want to go away.

755
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,776
That's why I wanted
to meet you.

756
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:08,815
Does that mean you've come
to say goodbye?

757
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,724
- That depends on you.
- What do you mean?

758
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,556
Erland - come with me.

759
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,733
That's impossible, Gertrud.

760
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:28,807
- Is it because you have no money?
- No, I don't.

761
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:35,241
I have enough to get started.

762
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,416
Are you saying I should live
on your money?

763
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:42,390
Yes.

764
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,752
You'll despise me.

765
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:51,455
Then you don't know
what love is, Erland.

766
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:53,659
I would despise myself.

767
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:58,630
You do that anyway - sometimes.

768
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:02,376
Yes I do.

769
01:18:04,546 --> 01:18:08,107
I can't despise myself because
I do what I have to do.

770
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:15,557
I have to confess I went to
Constance's party

771
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:18,192
in Florabakken after all.

772
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:27,131
- I had to.
- Yes, you had to -

773
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:30,231
had to -

774
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:33,941
that's the key word to everything.

775
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:43,280
Is it just for the sake of money
you won't leave with me?

776
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,986
I'd have to think about it,
Gertrud.

777
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:55,257
You said before we could love
each other without a divorce.

778
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:57,865
That sounded ugly.

779
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:03,831
I don't understand. It didn't
embarrass you the other day.

780
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:11,335
Erland - When will we begin to
speak the same language -

781
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,909
Erland, my love,
come away with me.

782
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,651
We don't need to marry.

783
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,155
We'll just live together
to be near each other.

784
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:29,220
I love you. Let's go away.

785
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:34,001
When you no longer love me,
you can leave me.

786
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:39,469
- Well - and then what?
- Then?

787
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,743
Then nothing will matter.

788
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:56,717
Gertrud. I can't go with you.
I'm not free.

789
01:20:14,961 --> 01:20:17,555
You said - not free?

790
01:20:18,298 --> 01:20:22,496
Yes, she's older than I.

791
01:20:23,303 --> 01:20:25,567
She's meant much to me. Helped me
when things were difficult.

792
01:20:25,772 --> 01:20:27,501
I can't leave her in the lurch.

793
01:20:29,475 --> 01:20:31,067
Besides, she's pregnant.

794
01:20:32,645 --> 01:20:35,842
And you never said a word
about it.

795
01:20:37,884 --> 01:20:40,648
I didn't believe
it was serious between us.

796
01:20:41,888 --> 01:20:43,879
What did you believe then?

797
01:20:44,557 --> 01:20:46,081
I thought you were just out for
a little adventure

798
01:20:46,292 --> 01:20:47,691
and I saw no harm in that.

799
01:20:53,232 --> 01:20:55,894
And now the adventure has passed.

800
01:20:58,972 --> 01:21:00,633
Do you hate me for it?

801
01:21:01,908 --> 01:21:05,366
I love you but it's over.

802
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:09,437
I'm leaving and you'll marry.

803
01:21:20,026 --> 01:21:22,051
Gertrud, come with me.

804
01:21:23,062 --> 01:21:25,257
- Where?
- To my place.

805
01:21:26,866 --> 01:21:30,393
I love you but you don't
love me back.

806
01:21:31,871 --> 01:21:33,566
I no longer belong to you.

807
01:21:38,011 --> 01:21:39,376
Okay...

808
01:21:47,887 --> 01:21:51,118
No, I don't love you. If I did...

809
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:53,986
I'd leave with you and think
of nothing else.

810
01:21:58,498 --> 01:22:03,197
I have a dream about a certain
woman but it's not you.

811
01:22:04,971 --> 01:22:09,601
She'd be innocent and pure.
She'd obey me and belong to me.

812
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:12,607
You're too proud.

813
01:22:14,947 --> 01:22:19,179
I thought at first you had the
usual pride of a fine woman.

814
01:22:20,153 --> 01:22:22,678
This is worse.
Your soul is proud.

815
01:22:25,058 --> 01:22:27,253
Leave me alone, Erland.

816
01:22:28,628 --> 01:22:33,998
Gertrud, forgive me, let's not
part as enemies. Forgive me.

817
01:22:35,268 --> 01:22:36,633
Forgive?

818
01:22:38,137 --> 01:22:40,435
I wish I believed in a God

819
01:22:41,074 --> 01:22:43,406
so I could ask him to
protect you.

820
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:48,240
You don't believe in God,
Gertrud?

821
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,110
Do you?

822
01:22:52,919 --> 01:22:56,286
I don't know.
There must be a higher spirit,

823
01:22:56,489 --> 01:23:01,153
somewhere, otherwise so many
things are inexplicable.

824
01:23:02,795 --> 01:23:07,664
Well - now you must go.

825
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:41,089
There's a call for Mr. Kanning.

826
01:23:41,634 --> 01:23:43,067
Just a moment, please.

827
01:23:43,302 --> 01:23:44,462
By all means.

828
01:24:26,879 --> 01:24:29,643
It's you, Gabriel?

829
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:35,915
Yes, I've come to say goodbye.
I leave tomorrow.

830
01:24:36,556 --> 01:24:40,219
- So soon?
- Yes, and you?

831
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,054
- Will you stay here?
- No.

832
01:24:45,698 --> 01:24:51,603
I'll leave soon enough.
I've long felt homeless here.

833
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:08,110
Gertrud. You're leaving
and I'm leaving.

834
01:25:09,255 --> 01:25:13,089
Let's leave together.
Let's live together.

835
01:25:13,759 --> 01:25:17,593
Gabriel - you don't know
what you're saying.

836
01:25:17,964 --> 01:25:22,992
Have you never on lonely nights
heard my heart call out to you?

837
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:28,864
You asked yesterday what made me
long for home.

838
01:25:29,308 --> 01:25:32,209
It was you, a longing to
hear your voice

839
01:25:33,012 --> 01:25:35,572
and look into your eyes again.

840
01:25:36,616 --> 01:25:39,210
How strange all this is.

841
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,780
I knew you were married
and to whom

842
01:25:42,989 --> 01:25:45,981
and I thought - maybe her life
is now as empty as mine.

843
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:50,055
Nothing's like one thinks.

844
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:55,493
No. No, nothing's ever like
one thinks.

845
01:25:57,036 --> 01:26:01,302
Gertrud. Did you ever love
your husband?

846
01:26:02,508 --> 01:26:06,376
Love him? I don't know.

847
01:26:07,546 --> 01:26:12,245
I was thinking about your creed,
remember?

848
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:15,053
I don't know what you mean.

849
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:23,988
No, one never remembers everything
but the creed went:

850
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:28,396
"I believe in the pleasure
of the flesh

851
01:26:29,535 --> 01:26:33,266
and the irreparable
loneliness of the soul."

852
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:37,136
Oh yes. That sounds like me.

853
01:26:37,743 --> 01:26:39,370
I didn't forget it.

854
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:43,476
All those words at a time
when I thought

855
01:26:43,683 --> 01:26:46,550
our dream would become a reality.

856
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:50,919
You wrenched me from
our dream of happiness.

857
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:52,886
We fell apart.

858
01:26:53,259 --> 01:26:56,990
So, I took refuge in the pleasure
of the flesh and only that.

859
01:26:57,863 --> 01:26:59,455
There, you have my marriage.

860
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:07,436
I thought so.
Gertrud. Come with me.

861
01:27:09,075 --> 01:27:15,537
No, Gabriel - for me there's
only loneliness.

862
01:27:17,283 --> 01:27:21,652
You've broken it off
with him then - Erland Jansson?

863
01:27:22,955 --> 01:27:25,924
I'm nothing to him.

864
01:27:27,693 --> 01:27:30,958
Gertrud. Come away with me.

865
01:27:47,813 --> 01:27:51,977
How can you still believe
we could breathe life

866
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:56,780
into what's dead and buried?

867
01:28:07,733 --> 01:28:10,964
Come, let's sit here a moment

868
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:14,137
as we so often sat together
at your place.

869
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:24,311
Don't think I've forgotten
all I owe you.

870
01:28:26,352 --> 01:28:30,812
You taught me love's
wonderful miracle.

871
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:34,823
You made me a woman with
every drop of life's blood.

872
01:28:35,027 --> 01:28:39,430
I belonged to you with
all my senses.

873
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:43,660
We grew together
and became one.

874
01:28:43,869 --> 01:28:46,064
There was no shame
between us.

875
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:53,341
Love cleansed me of everything,
of what was low and miserable.

876
01:28:54,113 --> 01:28:58,447
It opened me up
to the good and beautiful.

877
01:28:59,952 --> 01:29:04,116
I found in you a man with whom
I could share life.

878
01:29:06,025 --> 01:29:11,793
I asked myself whether I truly
deserved so much happiness.

879
01:29:12,164 --> 01:29:15,725
Gertrud, why did you ever
leave me?

880
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:23,735
Gabriel, do you really
believe I left you?

881
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:29,237
Don't you realize
it was you who pushed me away -

882
01:29:29,482 --> 01:29:33,145
gently... gradually.

883
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:36,686
I have never loved another.

884
01:29:36,889 --> 01:29:41,451
I believe you - as much
as you could love.

885
01:29:42,328 --> 01:29:46,788
But what was I to you?
You were tired of my love.

886
01:29:48,734 --> 01:29:52,465
When it became clear, I left.

887
01:29:54,039 --> 01:29:56,667
Gertrud, there's truth
in what you say.

888
01:29:57,042 --> 01:30:02,742
Work took you away from me, but
never did I want to break it off.

889
01:30:03,015 --> 01:30:06,815
You couldn't break it off.

890
01:30:07,019 --> 01:30:09,249
That's why it was good
that I could.

891
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:17,260
Your work divided us -
and honor -

892
01:30:17,463 --> 01:30:22,400
and fame, and money.
You desired these.

893
01:30:23,536 --> 01:30:26,630
Love had become a burden for you.

894
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:32,773
You wanted the pleasure
of the flesh, not love.

895
01:30:33,012 --> 01:30:36,004
It's the terrible truth.

896
01:30:36,248 --> 01:30:37,715
I felt it.

897
01:30:40,753 --> 01:30:43,847
I'll tell you when I knew
for sure.

898
01:30:45,257 --> 01:30:48,624
It was during the time you
hadn't had any meaningful work

899
01:30:48,827 --> 01:30:50,954
for a long period.

900
01:30:51,497 --> 01:30:54,523
A difficult time.
For me, too.

901
01:30:55,568 --> 01:30:57,365
Then one day I visited you.

902
01:31:00,839 --> 01:31:04,798
<i>And I decided to tidy up.

903
01:32:40,572 --> 01:32:42,631
<i>I wanted to write you
a few words.

904
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:09,122
<i>Some scrap paper you used
for notes lay on your desk.

905
01:33:14,807 --> 01:33:17,173
<i>On one of them,
you drew my profile

906
01:33:17,376 --> 01:33:21,312
<i>and those words
that devastated me.

907
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:23,504
<i>"A woman's love and a man's
work are mortal enemies."

908
01:33:38,297 --> 01:33:40,697
That's when I knew for certain.

909
01:33:42,234 --> 01:33:45,795
And my life was ruined
by a bit of scrap paper.

910
01:33:46,438 --> 01:33:50,738
Ruined? You got what you wanted.

911
01:33:51,477 --> 01:33:53,911
Nothing has been won.

912
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:57,113
No, but one must choose.

913
01:33:57,683 --> 01:34:04,486
And one always loses the thing
he cherishes the most.

914
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:07,055
Always.

915
01:34:08,394 --> 01:34:13,593
When I realized everything...
my heart grew old.

916
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:18,793
I was ashamed and loathed
being a woman.

917
01:34:19,972 --> 01:34:24,272
I saw how men who become great

918
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:29,511
never know or understand love.

919
01:34:30,549 --> 01:34:35,816
They look down on love.
They despise love.

920
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:39,955
You had become like them.

921
01:34:40,926 --> 01:34:42,826
And I don't love you.

922
01:34:44,730 --> 01:34:45,958
Gertrud.

923
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,492
My life is those three years
you loved me.

924
01:34:52,738 --> 01:34:57,175
You left me. How could you?

925
01:34:58,143 --> 01:34:59,872
How could you?

926
01:35:04,750 --> 01:35:08,117
I knew it would hurt you.

927
01:35:09,488 --> 01:35:12,048
I knew from your letter.

928
01:35:12,424 --> 01:35:15,552
It hurt more than I had thought.

929
01:35:18,831 --> 01:35:26,294
You became great but for me
you are as cold as stone.

930
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:31,432
I want pure, warm blood.

931
01:35:32,978 --> 01:35:35,344
I don't care about greatness.

932
01:35:58,504 --> 01:36:01,064
There's no greatness, Gertrud.

933
01:36:03,208 --> 01:36:07,770
The night is long,
space endless

934
01:36:09,414 --> 01:36:13,214
but the earth is small
and people are small.

935
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:19,052
What I remember from my life
is my love for you.

936
01:36:20,092 --> 01:36:23,186
You taught me love is
everything.

937
01:36:25,264 --> 01:36:27,892
We shouldn't be alone.

938
01:36:29,635 --> 01:36:33,162
I have been alone much too much.

939
01:36:34,072 --> 01:36:36,267
We shouldn't be many.

940
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:38,542
One needs to be two.

941
01:36:40,412 --> 01:36:45,076
Gertrud, we two belong together.

942
01:36:46,018 --> 01:36:49,784
Yes, one should be two.

943
01:36:51,323 --> 01:36:57,023
To think you understand that,
now that it's too late.

944
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:02,824
It's never too late.
Come away with me.

945
01:37:03,902 --> 01:37:09,397
We'll live in a house by the
sea and nothing or no one

946
01:37:09,608 --> 01:37:14,477
shall separate us.
Nothing but death.

947
01:37:15,847 --> 01:37:19,544
There's no happiness in love.

948
01:37:20,852 --> 01:37:23,787
Love is suffering.

949
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:27,816
Love is unhappiness.

950
01:37:30,829 --> 01:37:37,632
Gabriel, an empty space
is in your breast.

951
01:37:39,037 --> 01:37:40,937
I can't help you.

952
01:37:41,473 --> 01:37:44,340
Look for nothing from me.

953
01:37:48,547 --> 01:37:52,540
Too late and in vain.

954
01:38:23,181 --> 01:38:29,211
My life's epitaph -
in vain.

955
01:39:13,932 --> 01:39:16,992
You must excuse me.
It took some time.

956
01:39:18,136 --> 01:39:21,537
Gertrud, how do you feel?

957
01:39:21,907 --> 01:39:24,603
Fine, thank you.

958
01:39:27,813 --> 01:39:29,974
The Minister of State
wouldn't let me go.

959
01:39:32,084 --> 01:39:34,575
I've got to be going.

960
01:39:34,853 --> 01:39:37,253
Wait. We must have
a glass of champagne.

961
01:40:14,659 --> 01:40:16,786
374.

962
01:40:19,231 --> 01:40:21,825
I'd like to speak to
Professor Axel Nygren.

963
01:40:26,071 --> 01:40:29,040
Axel, is that you? It's Gertrud.

964
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:33,274
I'm calling to tell you
I'm coming to Paris.

965
01:40:34,579 --> 01:40:37,980
You'll help me get registered
at the Sorbonne?

966
01:40:39,217 --> 01:40:42,983
Yes, yes, I'd love to join
the group you talked about.

967
01:40:44,256 --> 01:40:48,056
I'll write before I come.
What's your address?

968
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:53,923
Number 72. Thanks.

969
01:40:55,467 --> 01:40:58,027
Goodbye Axel. See you soon.

970
01:41:07,846 --> 01:41:08,972
There you are.

971
01:41:12,551 --> 01:41:15,816
Gertrud, you've come
just in time.

972
01:41:16,922 --> 01:41:19,152
- Champagne?
- Yes.

973
01:41:21,092 --> 01:41:23,788
I've agreed to accept
the cabinet position.

974
01:41:24,095 --> 01:41:25,960
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

975
01:41:26,264 --> 01:41:28,630
- And from me.
- Thank you Gertrud.

976
01:41:39,778 --> 01:41:44,238
You don't look well, dear.
You said you felt much better.

977
01:41:45,283 --> 01:41:50,277
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
I'll go lie down soon.

978
01:41:51,122 --> 01:41:54,614
- You haven't eaten all day.
- I'm not hungry.

979
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:56,888
As you wish.

980
01:41:58,296 --> 01:42:02,528
So you've become a cabinet
minister's wife after all.

981
01:42:02,734 --> 01:42:08,536
Yes, I might as well enjoy it
as long as it lasts.

982
01:42:09,241 --> 01:42:16,545
Not long. Gabriel already knows
we are parting ways.

983
01:42:18,483 --> 01:42:22,214
- Then you told him?
- Yes.

984
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:24,718
Each of us will go his own way.

985
01:42:25,891 --> 01:42:28,758
Let me begin by saying goodbye.

986
01:42:30,795 --> 01:42:34,856
- Goodbye Kanning.
- Goodbye Lidman.

987
01:42:38,403 --> 01:42:41,133
It'll be a long time before
we see each other again.

988
01:42:41,339 --> 01:42:43,239
Yes, I suppose it will.

989
01:42:45,877 --> 01:42:47,367
Goodbye, Gertrud.

990
01:42:51,683 --> 01:42:53,173
Goodbye, Gabriel.

991
01:43:19,911 --> 01:43:21,401
Goodnight, Gustav.

992
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:24,574
I'll go to bed now, I'm tired.

993
01:43:24,816 --> 01:43:29,480
Gertrud, I've thought it over.

994
01:43:30,722 --> 01:43:35,455
I believe I've found a solution,
but answer me first.

995
01:43:36,628 --> 01:43:40,860
Did it happen? What we
discussed yesterday?

996
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:46,933
- You know it did.
- Yes, I know.

997
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:52,003
But Gertrud, you must not
leave me.

998
01:43:53,078 --> 01:43:55,444
Stay with me.

999
01:43:57,015 --> 01:44:02,453
You can have your new love -
since it means so much to you.

1000
01:44:03,421 --> 01:44:07,619
But stay with me and we'll
live together

1001
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:12,091
as good friends.
I ask for no more.

1002
01:44:13,865 --> 01:44:17,733
You want me to stay
because you hope

1003
01:44:17,936 --> 01:44:22,339
and believe the severed bond
between us can be renewed.

1004
01:44:23,742 --> 01:44:27,644
- Isn't that right?
- That's right.

1005
01:44:28,279 --> 01:44:29,769
I'm leaving.

1006
01:44:31,082 --> 01:44:34,882
- With your new love?
- Alone.

1007
01:44:36,721 --> 01:44:41,420
The new love doesn't want me.

1008
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:44,184
Good God.

1009
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:50,998
Is there a man alive whom
you love and doesn't want you?

1010
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:53,537
I don't understand.

1011
01:44:54,706 --> 01:44:57,231
I could stay here for his sake

1012
01:44:59,110 --> 01:45:01,169
but I'd like to be myself now.

1013
01:45:01,780 --> 01:45:03,873
That's why I'm leaving.

1014
01:45:06,551 --> 01:45:13,013
Goodnight, Gustav.
I'm so tired... so tired.

1015
01:45:15,293 --> 01:45:21,425
Tell me,
tell me you loved me once.

1016
01:45:23,668 --> 01:45:27,297
Why do you torture me?

1017
01:45:29,674 --> 01:45:35,271
When we met I'd already left
my love behind.

1018
01:45:36,648 --> 01:45:42,086
But my senses were alive and
my blood flowed.

1019
01:45:43,121 --> 01:45:48,923
There was something between us -
something resembling love.

1020
01:45:54,065 --> 01:45:56,533
Something... resembling?

1021
01:46:01,606 --> 01:46:04,598
Leave. Get out!

1022
01:46:06,478 --> 01:46:12,439
I never want to see you again.
Never hear of you again!

1023
01:47:05,403 --> 01:47:06,893
Gertrud.

1024
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:10,105
Gertrud.

1025
01:47:19,617 --> 01:47:26,318
There's a Professor Axel Nygren
here to see you.

1026
01:47:27,258 --> 01:47:31,718
Really? Is it Axel Nygren?
Show him in.

1027
01:47:41,472 --> 01:47:43,599
So you came on my birthday?

1028
01:47:43,808 --> 01:47:47,266
Yes, I came to give you
my new book.

1029
01:47:47,579 --> 01:47:49,706
It comes out next week.

1030
01:47:50,215 --> 01:47:54,413
It's a beautiful book - RACINE.

1031
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:57,320
To remind us of our days
in Paris.

1032
01:47:59,057 --> 01:48:02,857
Thank you, Axel. Sit down.

1033
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:16,097
Yes, I live here like a hermit,
forgotten, erased.

1034
01:48:16,374 --> 01:48:18,308
I like it that way.

1035
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:24,214
I need solitude -
solitude and freedom.

1036
01:48:29,687 --> 01:48:31,450
Here's the paper.

1037
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:34,317
Remember to wash the
kitchen floor.

1038
01:48:34,525 --> 01:48:36,516
The kitchen floor, of course.

1039
01:48:39,297 --> 01:48:41,492
That's all the house help
I have.

1040
01:48:42,267 --> 01:48:43,791
And what do you do?

1041
01:48:45,103 --> 01:48:50,700
I bake my own bread, wash my
chemise, mend my stockings.

1042
01:48:51,309 --> 01:48:52,742
I see you have a radio.

1043
01:48:52,944 --> 01:48:56,880
Yes, one must keep up with
what's going on in the world.

1044
01:48:57,649 --> 01:49:00,482
I wrote to you some time ago.

1045
01:49:01,152 --> 01:49:06,784
Yes, your letter's here,
as you can see.

1046
01:49:07,725 --> 01:49:10,250
You might have sent me
a few words.

1047
01:49:11,562 --> 01:49:17,865
No, Axel, I can't use a machine
to write an old friend.

1048
01:49:18,503 --> 01:49:22,405
Forgive me. So do you still
care about me a little?

1049
01:49:23,708 --> 01:49:29,772
I've always been very fond
of you. I still am.

1050
01:49:36,754 --> 01:49:37,743
Come.

1051
01:49:48,032 --> 01:49:50,125
I wonder how long it's been

1052
01:49:50,435 --> 01:49:52,869
since we've been
to a lecture together.

1053
01:49:53,071 --> 01:49:56,507
It must be 30-40 years.

1054
01:49:57,542 --> 01:50:00,875
Our friendship has lasted
that long?

1055
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:05,243
A friendship that never
turned to love.

1056
01:50:06,351 --> 01:50:09,548
But you've been
a good friend to me.

1057
01:50:09,787 --> 01:50:14,656
You're still young, your skin
is so white and smooth.

1058
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:20,192
I'll get more wrinkles and
my skin will turn yellow.

1059
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,496
- Do you know what I'm thinking?
- No.

1060
01:50:25,703 --> 01:50:28,968
- Do you want your letters back?
- Yes, I would.

1061
01:50:29,173 --> 01:50:33,109
I'd rather not have strangers
reading what were warm

1062
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:37,475
and good words spoken
from your heart.

1063
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,222
There you are.

1064
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:58,660
Would you mind if I burned them?

1065
01:50:58,936 --> 01:51:02,201
Now the letters are yours.
Do what you wish.

1066
01:51:06,344 --> 01:51:08,369
Have you ever thought
of writing poetry?

1067
01:51:09,213 --> 01:51:11,238
Yes, I have. Actually
I've written a poem,

1068
01:51:11,716 --> 01:51:14,879
one poem when I was 16.

1069
01:51:16,888 --> 01:51:18,116
Here it is.

1070
01:51:18,556 --> 01:51:21,821
Shall I read it to you?
It has three verses.

1071
01:51:22,026 --> 01:51:23,118
Read.

1072
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:29,925
Just look at me.
Am I beautiful?

1073
01:51:30,134 --> 01:51:32,864
No
but I have loved.

1074
01:51:33,171 --> 01:51:36,868
Just look at me.
Am I young?

1075
01:51:37,675 --> 01:51:40,508
No
but I have loved.

1076
01:51:40,878 --> 01:51:44,279
Just look at me.
Do I live?

1077
01:51:44,782 --> 01:51:48,411
No
but I have loved.

1078
01:51:50,721 --> 01:51:58,093
Sixteen year-old Gertrud -
my gospel according to love.

1079
01:52:00,498 --> 01:52:02,728
Remember what you said:

1080
01:52:04,702 --> 01:52:08,331
There's nothing else in life
but love.

1081
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:13,371
Nothing. Nothing else.

1082
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:19,946
Do you still stand by
those words? Do you regret them?

1083
01:52:20,852 --> 01:52:25,721
No, I don't regret them.
I stand by what I said,

1084
01:52:26,724 --> 01:52:32,060
there's nothing else in life
but youth and love,

1085
01:52:32,830 --> 01:52:36,163
unending tenderness
and quiet happiness, Axel.

1086
01:52:38,436 --> 01:52:43,305
When I'm near the grave and
look back on my life,

1087
01:52:43,608 --> 01:52:45,473
I'll say to myself...

1088
01:52:45,877 --> 01:52:50,837
I suffered much and often
made mistakes,

1089
01:52:51,516 --> 01:52:53,575
but I have loved.

1090
01:52:54,785 --> 01:52:58,016
You think a lot about death
and the grave?

1091
01:52:58,222 --> 01:53:03,353
Yes, I've already bought
my resting place.

1092
01:53:04,328 --> 01:53:06,489
I know where I'll be laid to rest,
under a mulberry tree.

1093
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:09,427
Yesterday, I ordered the
head stone for my grave

1094
01:53:09,634 --> 01:53:12,694
and I decided
what shall be on it.

1095
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:18,201
- Your name, of course?
- No, just two words.

1096
01:53:19,176 --> 01:53:21,201
Amor Omnia

1097
01:53:23,548 --> 01:53:26,676
Love is all.

1098
01:53:26,984 --> 01:53:32,081
Yes. Love is all.

1099
01:53:38,629 --> 01:53:44,431
The gardener has been told that
only grass shall grow on my grave

1100
01:53:45,536 --> 01:53:48,300
and in springtime I shall
have anemones.

1101
01:53:49,307 --> 01:53:51,275
You'll come by one day,

1102
01:53:51,542 --> 01:53:54,272
pick an anemone and
think of me.

1103
01:53:59,784 --> 01:54:07,850
Take it as a word of love that
was thought, but never spoken.

1104
01:54:10,428 --> 01:54:14,330
Now you'd better go, otherwise
we'll end up

1105
01:54:14,565 --> 01:54:17,159
by running off to Paris.

1106
01:54:20,538 --> 01:54:28,775
One day your visit will be
only a memory -

1107
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:32,313
as all the other memories
I cherish.

1108
01:54:33,484 --> 01:54:37,978
Sometimes I bring forth the
memories and lose myself in them.

1109
01:54:38,689 --> 01:54:44,025
I feel as if I am gazing at a
fire about to be extinguished.

1110
01:54:46,764 --> 01:54:50,495
Thank you, Axel.
Thanks for visiting.

1111
01:54:50,835 --> 01:54:52,530
Thank you for your book.

1112
01:54:54,405 --> 01:54:57,636
Goodbye, Gertrud.

1113
01:54:58,636 --> 01:55:08,636
