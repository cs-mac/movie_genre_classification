1
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,320
I've been thinking about charity

2
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,120
you know...giving myself to others...

3
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,210
I'm here at
Clausen Middle School,

4
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,920
where only hours ago a mountain lion
was shot dead.

5
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,590
Parents, neighbors and teachers
were all shaken up...

6
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,640
yet thankful that no one was hurt.

7
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,600
Animal Control said that 
there was nothing else they could do

8
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,600
that the lion was clearly lost and that
 it would never again be able to fully adjust

9
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,480
to extraneous wild life, now that it had
spent time at the middle school

10
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,200
They can be dangerous, and so...

11
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,370
I guess after this incident
they'll probably be...

12
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,250
telling all the teachers and the students,
you know, to really be...

13
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,080
keep an eye out because, uh, uh...
one wrong move...

14
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,960
especially if you run...
then you become the prey.

15
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,550
This is the first lion to be killed on the campus,
but by no means the first sighting for the school...

16
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,180
The school had another sighting last summer...
that time the lion was able to get away

17
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,310
as Authorities arrived too late. Will 
there be more? No one knows for sure.

18
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,800
For KAM News...this is...Teresa Morales.

19
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,210
Sometimes...
the most beautiful things...

20
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,720
are the most innocent things,
and they keep passing us by.

21
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,050
I won't let them pass you by.

22
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,480
Rodeo Walker. Everyone knows who you are.
I heard you stabbed a kid with a pencil.

23
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,150
and that you just watched him bleed...
but ... but you didn't get in trouble for it...

24
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,780
like...nobody called on you...
why would nobody call on you?

25
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,120
Hey...

26
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,410
What?

27
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,370
You want to... come over 
after school today?

28
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,370
I don't know...

29
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,170
I still got that movie...

30
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,930
It's not due back till tomorrow.

31
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,400
Oh, yeah?

32
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,340
Well, do you wanna?

33
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,850
It centers
on an invented character...

34
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,600
José Jiménez, the reluctant astronaut.

35
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,900
My name is José Jiménez.

36
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,270
I am cheap astronow!

37
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:52,200
think guys like...Rodeo Walker...or...
Bryce Matthews have... anything to worry about ?

38
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,540
what do you mean ?

39
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,370
other boys,
the ones not like us ?

40
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,290
you think they ever worry about...anything ?

41
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,380
like getting beat up ?
Oh! not like that...

42
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,340
like what ?

43
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,140
well...they just seem so perfect...

44
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,640
They're not perfect.

45
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,480
More perfect than I am.

46
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,150
I don't think anybody's perfect...

47
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,900
They...get a lot of girls ...

48
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,900
so ?

49
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,320
so...girls don't even talk to us...

50
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,370
Those are boring...
they only talk to each other...

51
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,120
I heard Bryce has a big.....penis...

52
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,920
What ?

53
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,750
I heard some girls talking about it.

54
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,590
What girls ?

55
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,510
I don't know...girls from school...

56
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,760
They said that ?

57
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,350
Yeah, one of them said it was like...
size of a forearm or somethin'...

58
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,310
I don't think that's possible...

59
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,690
How do you know ?

60
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,860
It's just not...like ? ? or something...

61
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,570
Even if it's not true,

62
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,860
Girls don't talk about us like that.

63
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,280
What about...... Rodeo ?

64
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,370
I wonder if he's a virgin ?

65
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,830
I doubt it...

66
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,380
Who do you think he's had sex with ?

67
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,880
I don't know, probably like...5 girls

68
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,760
Girls from school ?

69
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,970
I guess...maybe younger ones.

70
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,190
I don't really see him with girls...

71
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,070
cheers inside the Space Center, mingled
with the song of an anti poverty group...

72
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,530
demonstrating outside.
They're a full scale model of the Lab.

73
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,120
They demand more attention 
to Amercia's problems on earth...

74
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,290
but also have prays for the astronauts.

75
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:04,831
Joey ?

76
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,080
Yeah ?

77
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,380
How big, would you say.....your penis is ?

78
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,680
What ?

79
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,720
like....erect, you know ?

80
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,910
I guess...I haven't really ever measured it.

81
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,310
Oh...

82
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,020
And you ?

83
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,272
No.

84
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,940
I guess it ever really ? to.

85
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,160
We could, you know...just to know.

86
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,740
It..seems like something we should know...

87
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,160
Don't you think ?

88
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:00,800
Well ?

89
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,770
Six!, I got six...!

90
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,480
Yeah, well...you're older.

91
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,280
Six is good right ?

92
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,330
You know how to make it go away, right ?

93
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:23,950
Yeah

94
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,790
Mee too, if you put a Nickel on it,
it will go away...

95
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,420
Oh...yeah ?

96
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,530
What happened....is no laughing matter.

97
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,450
It's not funny !
Mountain Lions are a very dangerous breed.

98
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,630
OK? At any moment they
could harm...or attack anyone of us.

99
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,130
Without warning...

100
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,380
Whitout warning...!

101
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,640
We hear clausing our purchasing,
somewhat of a...

102
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,760
lion nullification system.

103
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,270
We hope that this new alarm system

104
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,230
will prevent, another...incident, or attack...

105
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,930
from happening , but we're a little short of our goal,
and that's where you come in...

106
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,860
So, what we need is all of you,
to go out there, and sell these safety bands...

107
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,160
which we've already begun distributing to
the Peer Helper's Club...

108
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,620
and what we expect of you
is to support your school...

109
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,080
we hope that you all support the Club...

110
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,750
and together, we can all achieve...
our goal.

111
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:59,380
and.....well uhhh... promote safety...

112
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,723
( Chicas en el fondo )

113
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Is this mine ?

114
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,400
No, that's mine.

115
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,600
I bought it at Tuberry Silver.

116
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,800
Oh!

117
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,580
For, like seven dollars.

118
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,490
Hello ?

119
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,450
I was sick today...

120
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,830
Did I miss anything ?

121
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,910
At school ?

122
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,500
Yeah

123
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,750
Not really, there was an assembly,
so you missed part of the second period...

124
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,300
Assembly ?

125
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,210
Yeah...but we're not last...

126
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,920
What are you doing right now ?

127
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,220
uh, nothing...just watching TV...

128
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,140
Yeah...me too.

129
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,720
My mom got me a bunch of Gatorade...

130
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,770
Cool...

131
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,270
Yeah.

132
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,600
And there's a Dance on Friday.

133
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,310
Who's Dance, this is stupid...

134
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,480
You've never been...

135
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,780
It's still stupid.

136
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,950
Everyone talks about it like it's such a big deal,
but...it's just...stupid.

137
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,740
A waste of time...

138
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,370
I might go...

139
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,870
I wouldn't

140
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,910
Why ?

141
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,290
Do you like somebody, or somethin' ?

142
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,710
How did you get sick ?

143
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,960
What ?

144
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,340
Like, why'd you get sick ?

145
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,930
Oh...I don't know.

146
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,390
Whatever it is,
made me throw up this mornin'...

147
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,600
Oh.

148
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,600
Did you turn that paper for English ?

149
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,900
Hmmm ?

150
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,010
I could have had that girl...
c'mon...fuck you...

151
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,460
Yeah...fuck you...!

152
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,970
You're a fucking fag, aren't you ?

153
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,270
No, I'm not...

154
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,930
What a fucking fag !

155
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,690
Brice , kick the shit out of this fag...

156
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,310
You like boys ?

157
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,730
Kick his ass !
Punch him !

158
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,280
What... are you doing?

159
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,720
I was going to the bathroom...

160
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,700
You woke me up.

161
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,200
I'm sorry.

162
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,290
Go to bed, Logan.

163
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,200
I had to pee.

164
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,710
I said go to bed, Logan !

165
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,390
Come here.

166
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,990
Give me a kiss.

167
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,520
I'm sorry...

168
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,150
come here...
come give me a kiss, will you?

169
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,950
Did you have a good time
at the dance ?

170
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,900
Did you dance with lots of girls?

171
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,130
Sleep tight, honey.

172
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,390
When I was in my prime

173
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,860
I flourished like a vine

174
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,320
There came along

175
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,320
A false young man

176
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:33,790
And stole away my time

177
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,920
time

178
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:45,510
And stole away my time.

179
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,720
The gardener standing by

180
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:57,810
Three offers he gave me

181
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:05,820
The pink, the violet
and red rose

182
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:13,910
Which I refused all three

183
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,080
Three

184
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:24,880
Which I refused all three.

185
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,810
Can we be evil together ?

186
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,520
I want to be evil with you.

187
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,100
Evil with you... evil with you,
evil with you, evil with you...

188
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,360
You should let me take a picture of you
like that after your fight.

189
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,950
What should I be doing ?

190
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,950
I don't know.
You don't have to be doing anything.

191
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,290
Wait.

192
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,810
What are you doing ?

193
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,190
It'll make a better picture,
don't you think ?

194
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,900
You look weird.

195
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,820
Just take it.

196
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,710
Check it out, I'm popular.

197
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,210
We should take another picture...

198
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:47,260
My camera has a timer, so we can set it
to take one with both of us.

199
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,410
OK.

200
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,070
Did it take it ?

201
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,840
Are you sure you don't...
remember who it was that...that hit you ?

202
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,010
Bryce, maybe...

203
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,720
Bryce Matthews ?

204
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,890
Yeah, I think it was him.

205
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,430
He was in another fight that night,
did you know that ?

206
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,720
Well, why would he hit you ?

207
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,350
Has he ever hit you before or,
or threatened to ?

208
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,439
No.

209
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,360
Uh, so he just hit you ?

210
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,940
Yeah, he said I was looking
at him funny.

211
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,320
Uh, what do you think he meant by that ?

212
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,780
Funny like, like you were making fun of him ?

213
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,620
I don't know, just funny, I guess...

214
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,460
He shouldn't have hit you.

215
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,960
He won't do it again.

216
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,630
Why won't he do it again ?

217
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,670
'Cause I won't look at him again.

218
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,430
- You think that's what he wants?
- Probably.

219
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,850
Do you feel different, Logan ?

220
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,640
What do you mean ?

221
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,140
Like from the other kids,
do they seem different ?

222
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,520
Yeah...

223
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,060
Does that bother you ?

224
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,860
- Not really.
- No? Why doesn't it bother you?

225
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,570
I don't know.
I don't mind being by myself or anything.

226
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,370
Are you by yourself a lot ?

227
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,160
I guess...sometimes.

228
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,680
Do you ever feel down
about being by yourself?

229
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,170
Sometimes.

230
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,300
What do you do when you feel down ?

231
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,010
I dream.

232
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,340
You daydream ?

233
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,010
Sort of.

234
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,020
What do you dream about ?

235
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,980
Being somewhere else,
not being alone.

236
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,320
Not being alone.

237
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,570
You think they really had to shoot him ?

238
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,240
What, the mountain lion ?

239
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,710
When they shot him, do you
think he knew he was going to die ?

240
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:28,710
Well, no one... nothing..ever does, I think.

241
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,750
Oh, then, maybe he died peacefully.

242
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,590
Would you like to think that's how he died ?

243
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,720
I guess, yeah.

244
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,390
You like mountain lions ?

245
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,390
Yeah, a lot.

246
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,980
What do you like about lions, Logan ?

247
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,440
I think they're not as bad as we think.

248
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,610
We're just kind of taught to be afraid of them...

249
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,440
I mean...

250
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,200
It's not like we've ever faced them,
or even ever seen them, so...

251
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,660
how can we really know ?

252
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,160
It's like if it has a name, and a face...

253
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,290
we can hate it, and it's just not fair...so...

254
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,630
I don't hate them, and I don't think they hate us...

255
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,210
They're just lost...

256
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,420
They wanna be here as much as we do...

257
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,990
- You're in trouble.
- No, I'm not.

258
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,700
You're not in class.

259
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,830
I was...I was talking to the counselor.

260
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,200
I hate her.

261
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,500
Yeah ?

262
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,210
Yeah, everyone here... they're all stupid.

263
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,340
Yeah.

264
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,710
Why'd you have to talk to her anyway ?

265
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,090
I got punched.

266
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:00,970
By who ?

267
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,469
Bryce Matthews.

268
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,930
- He's a dick.
- Yeah.

269
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,770
Why aren't you in class ?

270
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,940
'Cause I was late...

271
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,570
You can be late and still go, right ?

272
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,110
Why would I want to do that ?

273
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,990
Why would you want to sit here ?

274
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,990
Why'd he punch you ?

275
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,830
I don't know, he hates me maybe...

276
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,420
Hey, you're not wearing a safety band...

277
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,460
What's a safety band ?

278
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,170
You know...those gold r' bands,
those r' bands

279
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,890
they're supposed to protect us
from the mountain lions.

280
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,560
- How ?
- I don't know.

281
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,100
I'm not afraid of the mountain lions.

282
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,730
You're not ?

283
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,360
No. I've seen 'em.

284
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,980
I, like, know where they live.

285
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,570
Yeah, right.

286
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,650
I do.

287
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,160
Where do they live, then?

288
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,070
Out in the woods.

289
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,500
I want to see 'em.

290
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,330
Meet me in the woods then.

291
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,160
Really ?

292
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,830
If you're not afraid of them.

293
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,210
I'm not.

294
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,340
All right, tomorrow after school.

295
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,510
Hey, where are you going ?

296
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,390
Not to class...

297
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,110
you're a lion just like me...
you're a lion just like me...

298
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,990
Sometimes, I worry...

299
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,910
that I won't have good stories
to tell my kids.

300
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,960
Like...I won't have good stories
about, being a kid...

301
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,960
...that other people like, you know ?

302
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,960
It'll just be boring.
It'll just be boring. It'll just be boring.

303
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:07,300
It'll just be boring. It'll just be boring.
It'll just be boring...

304
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,320
There is a kid at my school...
this boy, Daniel...

305
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,820
he was always dirty
and got made fun of a lot.

306
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,320
He killed himself one day after school.

307
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,160
His mom found him hung in his closet.

308
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,620
Nobody really talks about him anymore.

309
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,580
It's like, it's just
something that happened.

310
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,340
Like it happened a long time ago
or something.

311
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,880
I bet now he looks down at us.

312
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,970
Maybe he just laughs.

313
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,680
Maybe he was always laughing, inside.

314
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,600
I guess it doesn't really matter.

315
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,090
I'll meet you in the 
woods tomorrow, after school.

316
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,990
You've got to be kidding me.

317
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,290
Why is it...

318
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,538
Logan ...

319
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,170
that everything, that you touch
turns to shit ?

320
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,920
Look at me when I'm talking
to you, pay attention!

321
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,630
Look at me!

322
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,430
Do you know how much this cost me ?

323
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,640
Do you have any idea
how much groceries cost ?

324
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,310
And you wonder why I'm never home ?

325
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,310
You broke the eggs.
You broke the eggs, that's great.

326
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,560
Why don't we just break the rest
of the eggs while we're at it, huh?

327
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,150
Dump all the rest of the milk.

328
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,860
I swear to God,
you do not pay attention to anything.

329
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,950
You are constantly off in another world...

330
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,910
and I am the only one that is around
to take care, of everything!

331
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:23,330
I have had it...
I need, some help from you!

332
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:27,750
I can't do all of this
on my own all the time!

333
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,210
Are you listening ?

334
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,970
Am I reaching you ?

335
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,350
You know what... I give up.

336
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,010
I give up, I give up.

337
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,560
Are you gonna cry?
You're gonna cry now?

338
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,690
That's rich.

339
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,980
You know, you can't cry about shit
when it's your own fault.

340
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,990
Egg all over my goddamn...

341
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,430
If I could be with you forever...

342
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,350
I would be your only dream.
I would be your only dream.

343
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,020
I would be your only dream.

344
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,810
I would be your only dream.
I would be your only dream...

345
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,450
I could hit him for you,
if you want.

346
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,660
Who ?

347
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,780
Bryce. I could do it, you know.

348
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,450
No, it's not worth it.

349
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,290
Yeah, maybe you're right.

350
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,870
Do you like school ?

351
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,790
Not really.

352
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:56,680
I hate it, I mean, not as much as I used to,
hate it, because, really, it's almost over.

353
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,680
What's almost over ?

354
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,260
Junior high, it's dumb.

355
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,390
It's just such a dumb time.

356
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,850
Yeah, but it's not really over.

357
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,860
High school will be better.
More kids.

358
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,940
Right, more kids that'll hate me.

359
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,650
Who hates you ?

360
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,030
I don't know, boys like Bryce.

361
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,030
Everybody, really.
Nobody talks to me.

362
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,660
You think I hate you ?

363
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,580
I don't know yet.

364
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:28,330
Yet. So you mean you will know ?

365
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,250
Yeah, maybe.

366
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,840
Well, I don't hate you.

367
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,550
Yeah, well, you're different then, I guess.

368
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,010
I really want to see lions, or...a lion.

369
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,180
I guess they're not around today.

370
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,060
How many have you seen ?

371
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,850
Like, two.

372
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,860
No, wait... three.

373
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,690
All together ?

374
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,070
No, different times.

375
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,650
Did they see you ?

376
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:58,987
No.

377
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,030
How do you know ?

378
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,410
You think I'd be here if they saw me ?

379
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,040
I'd be dead for sure.

380
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,750
You can't survive something
like that, you know ?

381
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,830
I thought they lived
in caves or something.

382
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,580
That's total bullshit.

383
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,086
Oh.

384
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:18,550
Some kid killed himself In one of those
caves, a couple years ago.

385
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,840
They just don't want us
messing around in there.

386
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,470
Don't want any more dead kids, I guess.

387
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,350
I guess I'm not scared of them, because...

388
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,060
I've got to see something

389
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,980
um, right in front of me, to
know what I think about it.

390
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,810
- You are different...
- Yeah.

391
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,200
My favorite's Tigers, really...

392
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,160
Where have you seen a tiger ?

393
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,330
Everyday at school,
tons of'em

394
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,420
Yeah, tigers are blind,
when they're born...

395
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,330
No, I didn't.

396
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,670
Yeah, read that somewhere...

397
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,340
It's like they're taught to see
or somethin'

398
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,250
Hello ?

399
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:37,000
Jesus, where were you after school ?

400
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,800
I was with Rodeo.

401
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,010
What ?

402
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,720
He said he knows where the lions are 
and he said he might take me.

403
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,390
- He's such a liar.
- No, he's not.

404
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,390
Right...
let me know when you see the lions then.

405
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,650
So what are you doing ?

406
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,360
Making a list.

407
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,560
A list ?

408
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,280
A list. Ways to be cool.

409
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,280
Ways to be cool ?

410
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,460
Yeah, so we can be cooler.

411
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,410
So what's on the list ?

412
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,740
Mostly stuff about motorcycles.

413
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,660
Motorcycles ?

414
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,300
Yeah, got anything to add ?

415
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,510
Uh...how about not making lists ?

416
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,270
That'll make you cooler.

417
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:26,800
Whatever.
Maybe I just won't give you a copy then.

418
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:35,770
Soo...

419
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,060
So what ?

420
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,530
This Rodeo's, like, 
your new best friend now?

421
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,280
I don't really have a best friend.

422
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,990
Oh ...

423
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,620
But you're still mine.

424
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,250
That's OK, right ?

425
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,360
Just call me later, OK?

426
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,140
Well, it's stupid.

427
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,050
Why is it stupid ?

428
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,980
Because... he's lame.

429
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,140
Why is he lame ?

430
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,100
He just is.

431
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,940
He probably, like, wants
to blow you or something.

432
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,860
What if he did ?

433
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,720
Did he ?

434
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,320
What can I say ?

435
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,110
Everyone likes me.

436
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,950
You're so full of yourself.

437
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,120
And you know what ?

438
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,500
If you, like, let him like you,
then you're a fag.

439
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,000
He's just bored with everything.

440
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,590
Except you, right ?

441
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,470
Yeah, he likes me.

442
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,430
But, what's so...

443
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,510
bad about someone liking me ?

444
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,430
Are you jealous ?

445
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,730
God, no.

446
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,980
Sounds like you are.

447
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,460
Well, he can't come over.

448
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,270
You can't bring him over here.

449
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,400
Why is that ?

450
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,530
Well, you just can't, OK ?

451
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,400
He's your friend.
Don't try to make him mine.

452
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,540
- Whatever.
- No, not whatever. I'm serious.

453
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,370
And if he makes you a fag,
then you can't come over either.

454
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:22,200
If you live as if someone else is always 
watching you, you'll be lonely.

455
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,030
lonely...lonely...

456
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,640
When you're a ghost, will you haunt me ?

457
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,180
What ?

458
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:39,600
A ghost.

459
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,600
I want to know if you'll haunt
me when you're a ghost.

460
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,690
You mean, like when I'm dead ?

461
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,230
Yeah, when you're really dead.

462
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,440
You want me to ?

463
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,530
Well, no.

464
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,280
Well, I guess I'd watch you.

465
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,000
I mean, I'll have to.

466
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,790
I'm your mom.

467
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,750
- You're my mom ?
- Yeah.

468
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:15,670
So... if you died tomorrow, like, in
the day, could you watch me in the night?

469
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,300
Yeah.

470
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,680
If I died, would I be able to watch you?

471
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,310
Would you want to ?

472
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,310
I guess. What else would I do ?

473
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,360
You better be watching me.

474
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,280
When I'm dead, like, when I'm really dead

475
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,030
there's no other me out there,
that's just the end of it...

476
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:46,080
and of everything I knew, 
the end of people knowing me

477
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,420
all this goes away, or what ?

478
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,670
- You think about this a lot ?
- Yeah.

479
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,090
So, why are you smiling ?

480
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,180
- I'm not smiling...
- You're smiling.

481
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,760
Well...?

482
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:12,940
Ummm , I don't know, sometimes I do wonder
if it would be better to be dead...

483
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:20,090
I mean, maybe it would just be like...
like floating.

484
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,870
But you know how when you really, 
you're all alone and...

485
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,120
it all gets really, really quiet

486
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:32,000
and the only sound you can hear
is your heart beating ?

487
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,460
It's like the only sound in the whole world.

488
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,600
But, if you were dead,
there'd be no heart beating...

489
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,060
There'd be no sound...

490
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:55,020
There'd be no nothing...
just....

491
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,320
Floating ?

492
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,900
Yeah, floating.

493
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:07,700
- All by yourself...
- All by yourself.

494
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,290
I think I'm gonna come back as a flower.

495
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,920
Yeah ?
What kind of flower ?

496
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,510
A Dalia.

497
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,340
Dalias are very pretty...

498
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:31,100
- Or a snake. Snakes are cool.
- Yeah.

499
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,360
Can you hold your breath when you're dead ?

500
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:52,360
We could drown together,
will you drown with me ?

501
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,170
Sure.

502
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:59,550
Oh . Okay . Good ! We'll invent our
own underwater language.

503
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,800
And the tigers above, they'll be blind.
they can't see us when we're under.

504
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,360
- Are we going under ?
- OK.

505
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:11,680
- Yes, more than OK ?
- Sure, more than OK.

506
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,680
If we both
pretend that there was an end...

507
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,710
then maybe there really will be
a beginning...

508
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,440
and it will start with us
running away together...

509
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,300
off, off, off...

510
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,760
far, far, far away.

511
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,800
And we'll live with the lions
and sleep in trees.

512
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,420
Just sleep, that's all we'll need.

513
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,280
Do you think about breaking things ?

514
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,240
We could break things.

515
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,490
Hearts ?

516
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,240
Don't break my heart.

517
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,430
So...when I, become a man...

518
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,480
It'll just all make sense.

519
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,070
I guess I'll ride horses...

520
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,820
or motorcycles, or a motorcycle
on my way to my horse.

521
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,990
and my family, my loved ones...

522
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,370
It'll just be all smiles, and whistles 
and car horns...

523
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:57,120
cars coming up de driveway,
it'll all make sense.

524
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,830
and now I'll be happy.

525
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,590
Nothing can break you and make sense...

526
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,510
you just can't be broken.

527
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:15,720
...most boys just want to get
drunk or go steal something.

528
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:18,350
They like to get into trouble.

529
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,350
Right.

530
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,860
Yeah.

531
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,110
You never want to do
that stuff, or what?

532
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,950
I don't know, I guess
I didn't really think about it.

533
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,040
That's cool.

534
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,030
Thanks.

535
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:38,290
How come you don't have a girlfriend ?

536
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,180
I don't know.

537
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,460
I have... a bunch of times.

538
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,420
How come you don't ?

539
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,930
I don't know...

540
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,860
Girls don't really like me, I guess.

541
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,100
They don't really think about me.

542
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:00,730
Sometimes... girls make me want
to go to sleep.

543
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,610
Yeah ?

544
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,610
I'm gonna go home and sleep.

545
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:11,660
I got, like, two hours
of sleep last night.

546
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,580
Last couple nights, actually.

547
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,030
Really ?

548
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,540
Yeah, but you can call me
if you're bored or whatever.

549
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,960
I don't really have your number.

550
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,040
Yeah ?

551
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,960
You never really gave it to me.

552
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:32,130
I don't really like to give it out.

553
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:45,190
I didn't think you were coming.

554
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,150
Oh!...No ?

555
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,940
I'm glad you did.

556
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,070
Did you miss me ?

557
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,990
I ceratinly have.

558
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,790
You sure know how to talk
to a woman.

559
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,120
You certainly know how to talk
to a man.

560
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,690
Oh!...I do ?

561
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,260
Your voice.
There's something about your voice.

562
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,220
What about it ?

563
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,390
It's all woman,
just they way it should be...

564
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:23,980
( Moanes excited... )

565
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,280
Hello ?

566
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,910
Hello ?

567
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,240
Is this Rodeo ?

568
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:06,290
Yeah, who's this ?

569
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,330
Oh, you don't know me.

570
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,460
But you know me.

571
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,960
What are you doing right now ?

572
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,550
Nothing. Who is this ?

573
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,810
I'm... Leah.

574
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,480
Leah.

575
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,270
Do I know you from school ?

576
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,980
You don't know me.

577
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,950
Yeah, but you know me.

578
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:39,660
I think you're cute.

579
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,660
You do ?
What do I look like, then ?

580
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,040
You look like...River Phoenix.

581
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,910
I don't know who that is.

582
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,750
Oh.

583
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,550
What about you ?

584
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,630
What about me ?

585
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,590
What do you look like ?

586
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,390
I don't know, my friends say I'm pretty.

587
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,850
Do I know your friends ?

588
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:08,390
Oh, I don't know.

589
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,560
What are their names ?

590
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,610
No, I don't think you know them.

591
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,780
Why are you calling me ?

592
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:23,660
I just wanted to say that I like you,
that I think you're cute.

593
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:28,750
Like... you want to blow me or something ?

594
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,710
Do you want me to ?

595
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,630
I don't even know you.

596
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:37,300
But... would you want me to ?

597
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,720
I want to be more than friends.

598
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,050
Shouldn't we be friends first ?

599
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,350
Oh... aren't we ?

600
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,390
You said you want me to suck you.

601
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,810
I want to know who this is.

602
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,980
I really am pretty.

603
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,860
My friends wouldn't lie to me about that.

604
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,570
So... what are you doing right now ?

605
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,780
Nothing, I guess.

606
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:06,580
Wanna get off ?

607
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,910
Right now ?

608
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,700
Yeah, like, on the phone.

609
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,750
What are you wearing right now ?

610
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,920
What are you wearing ?

611
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,300
I don't... want to say.

612
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,380
Boxers.

613
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,640
Oh.

614
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,640
I'm wearing this flower dress.

615
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,520
It's yellow and white.

616
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,060
I've got my hand down my pants.

617
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,650
Yeah ?

618
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,100
Yeah.

619
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:37,610
Hold on.

620
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:43,740
Have you... done this before ?

621
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,120
Like, with other girls ?

622
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,120
What ?

623
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,620
Like... on the phone ?

624
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:56,790
Are you touching yourself ?

625
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,340
Yeah.

626
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,550
I wanna see who can come first.

627
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,550
Like a race ?

628
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,300
Yeah.

629
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,340
Ok.

630
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:08,860
I can... feel you more than
any ghost would ever dare try.

631
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,120
Uh, I've got to go.

632
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,730
If I run, it's due to you...
we'll be together,

633
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,060
we're like bandits on the run.

634
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,190
Can we really get away, with all of it ?

635
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,490
Can we get away with all of it ?

636
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:12,610
Blue, green colors flashing...

637
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,070
I'm holding my breath 'till we find our way...

638
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,160
Are you going my way ?

639
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,500
Hey.

640
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,920
Hey.

641
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,560
You want some ?

642
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,450
Hey. We should go.

643
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,590
Sometimes, I think about 
breaking you into pieces.

644
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,460
Like a million pieces...

645
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,590
You'll be buried..

646
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:22,970
all buried between blades of grass,
the grass under my feet between my toes.

647
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,600
I'll bury you under and between my feet.

648
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:29,020
But don't worry, cause,
I'll be in pieces too.

649
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,600
We'll put ourselves 
back together...OK ?

650
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:36,570
Like one...one...like one...

651
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:56,960
You're not...using me.
You wouldn't use me, would you ?

652
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:59,260
I just have to know.

653
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:41,300
I'm swaying...I sway, over you.

654
01:04:58,570 --> 01:04:59,940
Hello ?

655
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,780
Hi, it's Leah.

656
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,030
Hey.

657
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,930
What's going on ?

658
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,450
Nothing.

659
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:12,330
Bored, like always.

660
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:15,330
Wanna talk ?

661
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,090
I wanna fuck.

662
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,590
Who ?

663
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:21,300
Whoever this is.

664
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,120
Oh.

665
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,890
OK...

666
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:32,590
You can... fuck me.

667
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,760
Where ?

668
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:39,940
Can't we... do it on the phone ?

669
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,940
No...

670
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,240
Why not ?

671
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:46,630
Because that's not fucking.

672
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,880
Oh .

673
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,320
You're a girl, aren't you ?

674
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,910
Yeah.

675
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,720
Then why can't I fuck you ?

676
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,210
I'm a girl.

677
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:08,140
You can, I just... don't know if I'm...
ready for that.

678
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,290
Call me when you are.

679
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:19,190
If...you don't answer...

680
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:22,770
I was just, bring it off the wall.

681
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:26,990
If a voice across the line
gives me a strange sensation....

682
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:30,120
emotions come, I don't know why.

683
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,950
You keep me hanging on the telephone.

684
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:42,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

685
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:47,170
There was another lion...

686
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,300
Really? Thats cool!

687
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:53,180
- Yeah.
- Cool...how close did it get ?

688
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,890
Close. A bunch of kids saw it.

689
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:57,150
Did they shoot it ?

690
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:02,150
No...it ran away, before anyone got there.

691
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:07,360
- Cool.
- Maybe we could hang out later ?

692
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:11,620
Oh , I don't know, I have stuff to do.

693
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,660
Well, have you decided about camping yet ?

694
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,330
I don't know yet.

695
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:19,960
- My mom...
- I'll call you later, OK ?

696
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,690
Hello ?

697
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,570
Hey, it's Leah.

698
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:39,910
Oh.

699
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:41,660
Hey.

700
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,080
What's going on ?

701
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,450
Nothing.

702
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,330
What do you want ?

703
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:48,460
I think...

704
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,090
I'm ready to have you fuck me.

705
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:56,920
OK, where ?

706
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,720
The caves.

707
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,810
Where the lions live ?

708
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,640
They're not there.

709
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,100
How do you know ?

710
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:13,110
I've...

711
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:15,110
been there before.

712
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:17,030
Ok...

713
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:19,360
What time ?

714
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,910
Two hours.

715
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,750
I want to tell you something.

716
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:01,470
You know...

717
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,350
I'm here.

718
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:54,020
Yeah ?

719
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,610
Why won't you let me see you ?

720
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,480
Take...

721
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,610
off your clothes.

722
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,840
Are we gonna fuck or what ?

723
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,270
You can... fuck me.

724
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,840
You're not Leah.

725
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,830
Yes, I am.

726
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,570
You... really didn't know ?

727
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,460
Hey .

728
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:28,650
What do you want ?

729
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:32,950
You're not hanging out with...
Rodeo or whatever ?

730
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:35,072
No.

731
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,820
Why not ?

732
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:42,040
Rodeo and I...we're not 
really friends anymore, OK ?

733
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:43,410
Really ?

734
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:44,460
Yeah.

735
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:50,750
- Was it Kelly ? 
- Mhh? - Kelly Rogers , his girlfriend ?

736
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:53,010
She hates you, right ?

737
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:54,380
Girlfriend ?

738
01:19:14,338 --> 01:19:19,134
Kelly Rogers? .... Kelly Rogers.

739
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:48,790
Kelly Rogers ....Kelly Rogers ( keeps repeating )

740
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:37,340
Yes ?

741
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:39,050
Is Kelly home ?

742
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:44,140
She is...are you a friend of hers ?

743
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,470
sort of...uhh, can I talk to her ?

744
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:54,520
Uum...sure. One sec.

745
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:59,210
Kelly there's a friend of yours, to see you...

746
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:06,490
Can I help you ?

747
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:08,620
Hi! I'm Leah.

748
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:12,460
Leah ? You're Logan , right ?

749
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,210
No...I don't think we know each other.

750
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,420
I know who you are, OK ?

751
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,390
Why are you dressed like that ?

752
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,260
I'm just like you...

753
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:28,230
Well...you look stupid.

754
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,770
Are you stupid ?

755
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:33,640
What...?

756
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,770
I don't think I look stupid.

757
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:40,110
What do you want, Logan ?

758
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,570
I...wanted to ask you...

759
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:46,560
What ?

760
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:52,620
Do you think I...still have a chance with, Rodeo ?

761
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,960
You're...joking, right ?

762
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:58,877
No.

763
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,920
You're a boy.
Boys only like girls, OK ?

764
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,430
But I'm not a boy.

765
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,430
You're such a freak !

766
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,100
Rodeo's ...not, gay OK ? I would know.

767
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:20,150
I'm pretty sure he's in love with me.

768
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:25,820
Anything else ?

769
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,920
Did you ever wish you were someone else ?

770
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,660
Why would I wanna be someone else ?

771
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,840
Oh...right.

772
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,810
Hello ?

773
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,370
Hey...

774
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:11,870
it's Logan.

775
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:13,580
Hey.

776
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:16,370
What are you doing?

777
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:19,290
Nothin'.

778
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:22,040
Can you come over ?

779
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:24,090
Why ?

780
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:27,760
I wanna show you something.

781
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,940
Are you...

782
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:46,400
gay...?

783
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:51,780
No...

784
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:54,740
Some...
Someone at school said you're gay.

785
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,510
Who said that ?

786
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,750
Are you ?

787
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,210
I'm not gay.

788
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:08,470
But...

789
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:15,850
But, you like boys... right?

790
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:20,740
I don't know.

791
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,980
If you like...

792
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,820
boys...

793
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:28,200
then you're gay.

794
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:39,000
You think your mom would
still take me camping if I looked like this?

795
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:00,930
...you know...it gets better...

796
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:08,940
Junior high...

797
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,740
Everybody hates it.

798
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,260
It's up to you...

799
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,640
...how long you want to hate it for.

800
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:45,910
There's a lion on the campus.

801
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,040

821
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:50,020
We here at Clausen feel it's important...

822
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:51,910
to respect one another.

823
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:54,900
I'm talking about tolerance.

824
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,500
We also feel it's important...

825
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:00,090
to smile, to one another.

826
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,660
Something as simple as a smile.

827
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,840
It's really amazing, the difference
that it can make in a day.

828
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:13,120
And so we expect all of you
to tolerate one another...

829
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:17,650
to be kind to one another.

830
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:19,920
Your teachers and I have come up with...

831
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,800
something to help promote
this idea of...

832
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,840
... Kindness.

833
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:26,970
Shall we ?

834
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,600
This is our...

835
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,210
Tolerance Totem.

836
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:51,160
We hope that this...

837
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:55,160
with your cooperation,
will make Clausen Junior High...

838
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:58,670
a better place...for everyone.

839
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:02,960
How about a round of applause for our,
Tolerance Totem.

840
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:37,391
Logan!
