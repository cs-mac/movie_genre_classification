He's on his way.

157
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,764
Hey!
We need help here!

158
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,080
Right now, it is just you.

159
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,561
Do something!

160
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,090
Doctor!
It is the President.

161
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,562
I know who it is. I need a
kick bucket here! Yes, Doctor.

162
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,570
They need you in trauma one!

163
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,447
5 minutes.
It can't wait.

164
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,163
<i>Doctor Clark stat! Doctor Port stat!
Doctor Shire stat!</i>

165
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
Fire drill?

166
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,324
I got this.

167
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,129
<i>All we know is that
at roughly 12:45 or so</i>

168
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,283
<i>the shots were fired.
I think it would have been...</i>

169
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,283
They're saying he's alive.

170
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,646
You saw.

171
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,329
I need pressure right here!

172
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,090
I need a light.
Pressure right here!

173
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,522
Listen...

174
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,568
No breath sounds!

175
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,721
No pulse.

176
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,209
We have a heart beat.
We have a heart beat!

177
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,807
<i>I need his clothes off now!
Get his clothes off!</i>

178
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,650
<i>Let's get this off. Let's
get this off here, please.</i>

179
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,051
<i>Let's get that sleeve off.</i>

180
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,007
What's his blood type!

181
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,082
No, and it's dropping!
Dropping! Dropping!

182
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,650
Hold that arm up.
There we go.

183
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,571
Wait! We need
to leave those on.

184
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,569
Take these please.

185
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,722
<i>We need the
President's blood type.</i>

186
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,531
Stay here.

187
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,564
I need more blood!

188
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,051
<i>Get some tracheal tubes
in here.</i>

189
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,168
Blood type is O, RH positive!

190
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,766
<i>O, RH positive
on the blood type.</i>

191
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,410
I want everyone
out of this room!

192
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,363
I want all Secret Service
out of this room!

193
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,323
If you don't need to be here,
get out of this room! Now!

194
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,726
FBI, Secret Service
out of the room!

195
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,531
You don't need to be here young man.
We need some room to work.

196
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,444
You're going. Out, out, out.
Jesus.

197
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,329
<i>How's the blood pressure?</i>

198
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,930
I'm here!

199
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,331
<i>What is that? A trick?</i>

200
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,731
That's a wound.

201
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,484
Get that tube out of his mouth!

202
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,765
We need to increase air volume into his
lungs since we have a hole already. Knife.

203
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,171
<i>Hold pressure.
Got it.</i>

204
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,202
Wait, what's that?

205
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,887
Lumbar support? Why the back brace?
What's wrong with him?

206
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,450
<i>I don't care what it is.
Get it off!</i>

207
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,045
Cut it off please, nurse.

208
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,842
Okay, bilateral,
I need chest tubes now!

209
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,811
<i>Get some lats in here please.</i>

210
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,882
<i>Bob, I need you right here!</i>

211
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,650
Out, please. Out.
Thank you.

212
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,768
Okay?

213
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,968
<i>Stand back. We
need room to work.</i>

214
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,691
Got that down there?

215
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,289
You better get
a priest in here.

216
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,800
That's him.

217
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,724
Mr. Zapruder,
I'm Forrest Sorrels,

218
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,928
special agent in charge
of the Dallas district

219
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,048
of the United States
Secret Service.

220
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,841
Sir, did you tell Harry you took
film of the motorcade today?

221
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,767
Yes. So you did, sir. You
did film the motorcade.

222
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,648
I said yes.

223
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,846
And where were you
standing at the time?

224
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,207
I was on the concrete block
over there.

225
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,089
This first one, right here. Yes.

226
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,243
Now were you filming before
the President was shot?

227
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,608
Sir, where you filming before
the President was shot? Yeah.

228
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,843
So you were standing on top
of this, sir. Is that right?

229
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,041
You couldn't have been
more than 30 yards away.

230
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,691
Sir, would you allow me to take
that film into my possession?

231
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,083
Right now, there are people out
there who are ready to start a war.

232
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,050
The film in that camera is
the only way we have to know

233
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,168
what happened out here today.
You understand that?

234
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,686
<i>It's a matter
of national security.</i>

235
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,046
I need to think.

236
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,768
Sir, I'm no longer asking.

237
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,410
The Dallas News can develop it.

238
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,289
Let's go.

239
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,171
Clear the way.
Nurse.

240
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,208
Can we get some tape here?

241
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,887
Admiral George Burkley,
the President's personal physician.

242
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,168
The President has Addison's Disease.
He'll need these.

243
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,449
I have him on the leg.

244
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,171
<i>Injection is fine.</i>

245
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,244
What's the story on the priest?

246
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,163
He's on the way.

247
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,171
This is it.

248
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,887
No can do.

249
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,169
What do you mean?

250
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,808
That's 8 mil. We process 35 stills.
That's it.

251
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,721
You got to be kidding me.
Harry? I didn't know.

252
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,525
Try WFA next door.

253
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,001
There's a Kodak lab out
by Love Field.

254
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,281
A lot more gauze.

255
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,805
Yeah, here.

256
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,963
Let me listen.

257
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,189
I don't hear anything.

258
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,608
You feel anything down there?
Nothing, resume.

259
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,409
Still have no pulse.

260
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,808
Mrs. Kennedy.
Mrs. Kennedy.

261
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,242
Uh, basin?

262
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,403
That's a piece of his skull,
and some brain matter.

263
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,885
Let me listen, let me listen.

264
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,006
No pulse here.

265
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,130
Come on.

266
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,809
<i>Jim...</i>

267
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,761
Jim, you got nothing
to work with.

268
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,766
Jim.

269
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,651
It's time to stop.

270
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,081
I'm calling it.
It's 1 pm.

271
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,849
Jackie...

272
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,160
Jackie...

273
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,371
Jackie... it's time
to say good-bye.

274
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,408
Someone please tell me
what's next.

275
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,529
<i>We, uh...</i>

276
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,728
We need a coffin.

277
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,289
Excuse me.

278
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,725
Parkland just called.

279
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,970
He's dead.

280
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,769
Mr. President.

281
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,966
He's gone.

282
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,570
We need to get in the air.

283
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:41,048
Hey, we belong to Johnson now.

284
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,122
The whole federal
government belongs to him.

285
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,125
When Johnson goes, everyone
has to go with him.

286
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,604
Who stays with Jackie? Jackie
isn't chief executive.

287
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,329
Nor is she related
to one... anymore.

288
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,882
I'm not going
anywhere without her.

289
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,010
<i>Let us recall for you
now what has transpired.</i>

290
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,651
<i>KRLD is reporting that they
have been told by somebody</i>

291
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,850
<i>in the hospital
that the President is dead.</i>

292
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,491
Well, that is a repeat
of something

293
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,928
<i>that you heard reported to you directly
a moment ago from KRLD in Dallas.</i>

294
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,128
<i>And that is the rumor
that has reached them</i>

295
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,285
<i>at the hotel
that the President is dead.</i>

296
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,964
I need to go call my wife.

297
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,769
Look, if you want to
stay, you can stay.

298
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,484
If you want to go home
and be with your family...

299
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,528
Go be with your family.

300
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,206
<i>We do not know
what his condition is,</i>

301
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,170
<i>but the report is
that the President is dead.</i>

302
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,961
<i>This is not confirmed.
This is something that... Okay.</i>

303
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,763
<i>This is something that the... Word
just came to us a minute ago.</i>

304
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,970
<i>The word we have is that
President Kennedy is dead.</i>

305
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,525
<i>He was shot by an assassin at the intersection
of Elm and Houston Streets just as...</i>

306
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,362
Eternal rest grant
unto him, O Lord,

307
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,091
and let perpetual light
shine upon him.

308
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,331
May he rest
in peace. Amen.

309
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,284
Amen.

310
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,767
Thank you, Father.

311
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,049
Thank you for taking care
of the President.

312
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,804
Please pray for him.

313
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,884
I will.
God bless you.

314
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,291
<i>God bless you.</i>

315
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,930
Father.
God bless...

316
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,965
Thank you.

317
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,363
Let's do this. Why don't we
put our lists together?

318
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,568
We'll split them up
and work down.

319
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,881
I.. I got to call you back.

320
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,760
They just picked up somebody in Oak Cliff.
They think he's the shooter.

321
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,888
<i>Shot and killed the
same time as the President</i>

322
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,281
<i>We now have the name
of that suspect</i>

323
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,522
<i>who has been picked up
by Dallas, Texas police</i>

324
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,888
<i>in connection with the slaying
of a Dallas policeman.</i>

325
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,248
<i>The story says the Dallas
Police Department has arrested</i>

326
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,848
<i>a 24 year old man identified
as Lee H. Oswald</i>

327
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,491
<i>in connection with the slaying
of a Dallas policeman</i>

328
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,211
<i>shortly after President
Kennedy was assassinated.</i>

329
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,851
<i>Oswald is also
being interrogated</i>

330
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,321
<i>to see if he had any connection
with the slaying of the President.</i>

331
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,640
Did you hear that?

332
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,404
I did hear that.

333
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,761
<i>Oswald was pulled screaming
and yelling,</i>

334
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,241
<i>from the Texas Theater in the
Oak Cliff section of Dallas.</i>

335
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,767
<i>This story does not say that Oswald
is the man wanted in connection</i>

336
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,683
<i>with the slaying
of the President.</i>

337
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,047
<i>It says that he is
wanted in connection...</i>

338
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,088
Is he talking
about your brother?

339
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,045
Bob? Is
that your brother?

340
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,490
I have to go home.

341
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,322
<i>...has been apprehended.</i>

342
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,727
<i>Police are apparently
questioning both of them now.</i>

343
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,728
<i>J. Edgar Hoover has ordered the
full FBI...</i> What are you saying?

344
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,609
Oh, Christ.

345
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,011
<i>Jim.</i>
Just a minute. Wait.

346
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,403
<i>What? What are you
looking for?</i>

347
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,003
Lee Harvey Oswald.

348
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,651
<i>What is this? What is this?
Why do you have this?</i>

349
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,746
Why the hell do you...

350
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,251
This has got to be the guy.

351
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,965
Why the hell do we have this?

352
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,247
This guy works
in the Depository.

353
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,681
Yeah, a hundred feet from where the
President was shot. For how long?

354
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,720
I don't know. About a month?
What do you mean, a month?

355
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,161
<i>How do you know this?
'Cause I'm tracking him.</i>

356
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,481
Tracking him? Jesus!
For how long?

357
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,086
18 months.

358
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,885
Found it!
Come here.

359
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,684
Hosty's been tracking
him 18 months.

360
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,250
What the hell for?

361
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,685
You know, I couldn't
even tell you.

362
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,603
He's just a sorry
son of a bitch.

363
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,603
He's one of these guys
who says he's a Marxist,

364
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,886
then he's a revolutionary.

365
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,405
Revolutionary? For who?

366
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,562
Nobody. Nobody wants
this guy.

367
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,087
He defected to the Soviets a
couple years back. Now he's here?

368
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,367
They didn't want him.
Tried to off himself there

369
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,522
They said he could stay
as long as he didn't die.

370
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,171
And I guess he got bored
with that, came back.

371
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,720
Fain did the follow up
interviews on it.

372
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,565
Yeah, a couple of them. Figured there was
nothing there so he closed the file.

373
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,165
It was right before he retired.

374
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,226
Wife's Russian,
so I checked up on her.

375
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,804
Oswald was knocking her around some. That's
why I put him back on the active list.

376
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,120
You actually interview him?

377
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,850
No, he was never around.

378
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,129
When was the last time
you tried?

379
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,565
2 weeks ago.

380
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,448
2 weeks ago?

381
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,887
Yeah.
I saw the wife.

382
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,601
Saw the wife.
Well, today...

383
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,842
her husband
killed the President.

384
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,104
Which one is Sorrels?
I am.

385
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,448
This is Secret Service business.
Let me see it.

386
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,966
Half 1.8 zoom lens set for full close up.
So, can you do it?

387
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,368
8 mil is tricky. There's always a risk
with new technology. A risk of what?

388
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,727
8 millimeters is really
16 mil split in two.

389
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,768
Each frame is really
4 frames together.

390
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,763
2 running one way,
2 running the other.

391
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,446
It means twice the risk of
overexposure or destruction.

392
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,411
And there's always a percentage of the film will
get into partially or fully destroyed in the process.

393
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,881
Have you done much of
this type of thing?

394
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,962
3, maybe 4 times.

395
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,361
And how'd that go?

396
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,442
Look we can still send it up
to Rochester if you want.

397
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,965
We need to know
who's behind this.

398
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,763
We don't have
that kind of time.

399
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,361
Listen, I'm temporarily
transferring possession to you.

400
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,005
Nobody looks at it until we do,

401
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,481
and nobody talks
about what's on there.

402
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,771
Mr. Zapruder. Is that
okay with you? Yes.

403
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,040
Okay.

404
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,768
You okay?
I'm upset.

405
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,330
We're all upset.

406
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,201
<i>Latest news from Dallas.

Do not screw me, Harry!

416
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,562
I don't want, what's on that
film all over the papers.

417
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,926
Film stays with Zapruder.

<i>And you're sure you're ready?</i>

425

I'm ready.

00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,241
That's my granddaughter.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

427
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,005
My grandson.

428
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,208
It's your life,
Mr. Zapruder.

429
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,970
Looks like a good life.

430
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,487
Oh, God.

431
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,565
My God.

Oh, my God.

435
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,042
We're going to need
some copies of that.

436
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,370
I don't have
the right machinery.

437
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,649
You're going to have
to go somewhere else.

438
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,080
Mr. Zapruder.

439
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,241
<i>I wish you luck, sir.</i>

440
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,685
Do not stop!
Go, go, go!

441
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,765
All clear Mr. President!
This way, sir.

442
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,251
Go!

443
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,450
Go, go!

444
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,964
<i>Who are they?</i>

445
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,042
Dallas police and the FBI.

446
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,764
You sure attract a crowd.

447
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,890
He can ride with me.

448
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,604
He came with us.
He's gonna leave with us.

449
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,325
Easy.

450
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,369
Yeah, he said to meet him here.

451
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,125
Gentlemen, thank you very much.

452
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,002
We need 3 copies.

453
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,329
One for the Secret Service. One
for the FBI, and one for me.

454
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,645
Let me through.

455
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,441
Excuse me.

456
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,965
Hold it.
Excuse me.

457
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,600
What are you doing?
Who are you?

458
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,967
I'm the medical examiner.

459
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,969
This is a homicide case.

460
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,606
The deceased can't leave until
there's been an autopsy.

461
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,329
This casket cannot leave
the premises.

462
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,246
I'm the special agent in charge of the
White House detail for the Secret Service.

463
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,970
That is the President
of the United States

464
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,769
and we are taking him
back to Washington.

465
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,490
That's not the way we
do things around here.

466
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,244
It's a Federal crime.

467
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,322
No, it is not. There's
no Federal statue.

468
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,050
It's a murder, it's local,

469
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,724
and it's under
local jurisdiction.

470
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,529
Earl, be very careful here.

471
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,090
That is my body.

472
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,481
The President
is coming with us.

473
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,325
You can't take him. We
have laws here in Texas.

474
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,640
The law can be waived.

475
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,721
Not by me.
I can't do it.

476
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,926
Earl, let him go.

477
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,889
Do you have any idea...

478
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,201
any idea how difficult this
has been for Mrs. Kennedy?

479
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,363
I deal with widows everyday!

480
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,771
The remains will stay here.

481
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,490
I don't think so.
The remains...

482
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,369
What did you call it,
your body?

483
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,206
The hell with you, and
the hell with your law.

484
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,487
Move it out!

485
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,201
The Dallas police is here to execute
the laws of the state of Texas!

486
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,248
Screw the lid
on that coffin now!

487
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,810
Let it go.

488
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,921
You cannot take it.

489
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,321
It's against the law to remove

490
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,926
a corpse from the State
of Texas without permission!

491
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,889
Enough!
<i>You cannot fake it.</i>

492
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,962
We're leaving.
Move!

493
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,642
It's okay, Earl.
You did right.

494
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,242
What a shitty place to die.

495
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,290
You're not driving.

496
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,727
What are you talking about?
Don't.

497
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,486
Please, allow me.

498
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,847
It's okay.

499
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,129
Ma'am.

500
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,730
<i>Bob Bugger, ma'am.</i>

501
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,484
<i>God bless you.</i>

502
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,325
They're 5 minutes out.

503
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,441
Where we putting the coffin?

504
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,887
I don't know.
I never thought about it.

505
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,123
We're not flying it below
like a piece of luggage.

506
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,809
<i>We're riding it right here.</i>

507
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,645
Let's get these two rows
of seats off the plane.

508
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,963
Look for a tool box. Get some
tools up here, and bodies!

509
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,762
6 bolts.
<i>I need a screwdriver.</i>

510
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,444
<i>We got 4 minutes.</i>

511
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,808
<i>6 bolts tie it
to the fuselage.</i>

512
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,645
You got it?
You got them?

513
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,291
1, 2, 3.

514
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,245
Go, go, go.
Let's go.

515
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,560
Watch it.
Watch the back.

516
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,607
Come on.

517
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,644
Come on you guys.

518
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,924
<i>Let's just get the hell
out of here.</i>

519
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,570
All right, come on.
Here we go.

520
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,250
Keep the back end up.
Keep the back end up!

521
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

522
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,363
Watch that corner. You're
not going to make it.

523
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,683
Let's go.

524
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,726
Come on.

525
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,801
Push it.

526
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,606
All right, come on.

527
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,405
Easy.
Put it down.

528
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,164
Slow...

529
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,444
Dear God.
This work okay, Dave?

530
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,128
This is just fine, Lem.

531
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,765
This is the first time
the Secret Services

532
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,769
has lost a president
under its watch.

533
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,562
I think it may be
months from now.

534
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,089
Hello, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

535
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,571
I'm Robert Oswald.

536
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,489
The man who shot the
President, I'm his brother.

537
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,085
Jackie.

538
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,288
<i>I will faithfully execute...</i>

539
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,443
<i>The office of President
of the United States...</i>

540
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,171
<i>The office of President
of the United States...</i>

541
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,242
<i>I will, to the
best of my ability...</i>

542
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,129
<i>I will, to the
best of my ability...</i>

543
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,804
<i>- Preserve...
- Preserve...</i>

544
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,405
<i>- Protect...
- Protect...</i>

545
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,488
<i>- and defend...
- And defend...</i>

546
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,562
<i>the Constitution
of the United States.</i>

547
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,608
<i>the Constitution
of the United States.</i>

548
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,762
<i>- So help me God.
- So help me God.</i>

549
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,290
So, you finally bothered
to find me.

550
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,487
I'll probably starve now.

551
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,562
Momma's going to need money.

552
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,529
Mother.

553
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,888
I am responsible
for 2 presidents.

554
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,849
I'm sorry?

555
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,402
Kennedy and now
President Johnson.

556
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,486
I'm not even a Democrat.

557
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,644
Come on.
Let's go.

558
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,650
This room is bugged.
Be careful.

559
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,200
I don't care.

560
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,248
If you know
anything about this,

561
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,846
I want to know
what you know right now.

562
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,883
And no damn stories.

563
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,440
Well, I always knew Lee was some
sort of secret agent. Didn't you?

564
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,329
What are you talking about?

565
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,847
They recruited him
when he was in the Marines.

566
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,720
Who's they?
And what possibly for?

567
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,202
We did.
The U.S. government did.

568
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,490
He was sent on dangerous missions.
The first was to Russia.

569
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,324
Okay, okay,
let me get this straight.

570
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,722
Lee, our Lee...

571
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,451
is a super secret
government spy?

572
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,249
Mm-hmm.

573
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,767
Come back from Russia
with a 21 year old wife.

574
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,481
She doesn't speak English.
He can't hold a job.

575
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,881
They have two kids
and not a pot to piss in.

576
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,644
<i>That's impressive.</i>

577
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,843
That is a dangerous fellow,
Lee. And then what?

578
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,611
You know.

579
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,085
You're insane.

580
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,846
Don't you speak
to your mother like that.

581
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,891
Lee Harvey Oswald
has done more for his country

582
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,725
than any other
living human being.

583
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,209
I will never be ordinary again!

584
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,088
I was thinking when
I was waiting for you

585
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,322
about that book
I'm going to write.

586
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,411
What book?

587
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,290
It will have to be
very deeply researched.

588
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,045
A publisher, with money,
will have to come

589
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,600
with a paid writer
to do the work.

590
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,241
Mother...

591
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,211
I just want to make sure you understand
what is happening here today.

592
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,848
Your son, my brother...

593
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,720
has apparently killed the most
important person in the world.

594
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,884
And if that is true,

595
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,606
he is going to die
for what he has done.

596
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,881
It's my story, too.

597
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,442
There he is.
There's Oswald.

598
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,002
<i>Oswald say, "I did
not shoot anybody."</i>

599
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,162
<i>Hold on.</i>

600
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,323
Hold on.
I remember this guy.

601
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,171
Hey, Adam?
What?

602
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,568
He was here.
Who was here?

603
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,041
Oswald was here, in the office.

604
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,329
<i>He left something for Hosty.</i>

605
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,004
Oh, Christ.

606
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,090
Jesus.

607
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,803
Mrs. Oswald! Mrs. Oswald!
Mrs. Oswald! Did he do it?

608
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,045
Mrs. Oswald.

609
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,608
Your mother's a piece of
work, I'll give her that.

610
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,762
I don't know what we're going to do.
I've got two kids.

611
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,882
Well, we're all fathers.
You, me...

612
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,169
the police officer your
brother shot point blank.

613
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,844
The President.

614
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,446
Well, they were.

615
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,326
If I were you,

616
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,563
I'd consider changing my name.

617
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,210
I'd pray I never
needed the help

618
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,691
of the Dallas Police Department

619
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,525
or the Federal
government again.

620
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,604
I'd pack your things
and your wife

621
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,126
and those two children
of yours,

622
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,885
and I'd move as far
from here as I could.

623
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,201
I'd never come back,
even to die.

624
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,968
But... that's
just me.

625
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,164
<i>Oswald has been charged</i>

626
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,891
<i>with the murder
of a police officer.</i>

627
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,002
Where the hell have you been?

628
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,162
I was out doing my job.

629
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,643
Doing your job, huh?
What's this?

630
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,971
Shit, I get three of
these things every week.

631
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,724
This one's from Oswald.

632
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,802
Oswald left this
for you 10 days ago.

633
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,087
"You've been talking to my wife
Marina without my permission and I don't like you.

634
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,605
"You need to stop
talking to Marina or member of the family

635
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,091
"or there will be
a price to pay."

636
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,083
I've got 100 of these things.

637
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,447
It says that he's going
to blow up the office.

638
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,409
3 times a week
I get shit like this.

639
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,006
But this was written by the
assassin of the President!

640
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,287
And it was delivered
to this office

641
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,204
in person 10 days ago, Jim,

642
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,726
which means we had the
assassin of the President

643
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,162
in our office threatening a Federal
officer, which is a crime Not 10 days ago.

644
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,328
We did not have the assassin of the President.
For which he could be arrested.

645
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,165
We had another
goddamn delusional nobody!

646
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,004
Yeah, well he's a somebody now!

647
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,844
You never said one word about
killing the President!

648
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,727
No, Only you!

649
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,204
Well, if I worried about every son
of a bitch who wants to shoot me,

650
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,049
I'm in the wrong goddamn business!
Listen.

651
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,724
The world is not going
to care about you.

652
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,450
They're going to say
that we had him.

653
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,201
We had him, and we
could have stopped him!

654
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,890
Jesus Christ.

655
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,326
This might be, probably is,
now that I think about it

656
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,405
the biggest fuck-up in the history
of American law enforcement.

657
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,925
Fuck!

658
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,247
You, follow me.

659
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,725
All right,
give me your hands.

660
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,683
Need some help with that?

661
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,764
No, I got it. I need some
help from you to shut up.

662
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,561
Sit down, Lee!

663
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,685
How are you?

664
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,684
I don't think you've ever asked
me that question in my life.

665
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,562
I'm really confused.

666
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,451
Maybe you can tell
me what-what...

667
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,405
What is going on?

668
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,040
I don't know.

669
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,887
They have your pistol, they have
your rifle, and they've charged you

670
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,201
and you're telling me
you don't know.

671
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,411
God damn it, just
tell me what you did.

672
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,042
Don't believe all
this so-called evidence.

673
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,081
What's Marina going
to do with the kids now?

674
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,242
I don't know.
Well, we have friends.

675
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,090
Junie needs new shoes.

676
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,162
Oh, she needs new shoes.

677
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,001
How about a goddamn father?

678
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,969
How about a killer
for a father?

679
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,088
How about the killer of the
President for a father?

680
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,129
You're worried about shoes.

681
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,043
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

682
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,441
You've ruined that kid's life.
Both those kids' lives!

683
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,887
So forget the goddamn
stupid shoes!

684
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,685
<i>Can you hear me? Put the
phone to your ear, all right?</i>

685
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,167
Look at me.

686
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,049
I'm sorry.

687
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,528
Well, I'm going
to get you a lawyer.

688
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,170
Stay out of it.

689
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,480
<i>Stay out of it?</i>

690
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,847
My children, my wife,

691
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:13,644
my children's children,
all of us, for all of eternity.

692
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,841
You did this to all of us.

693
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,364
I don't know who
you think you are,

694
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,284
but I am your brother.

695
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,126
And I'll find you an attorney
and be back in a day or two.

696
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,843
Don't be running back
and forth all the time

697
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,491
and getting yourself in
trouble with your boss.

698
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,763
<i>Time to go.</i>

699
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,649
What did he say?

700
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,725
I don't know. I have
no idea who that was.

701
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,080
Thank you, sir.

702
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,962
It's been ringing all night.

703
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,407
<i>Everybody wants that film.</i>

704
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,849
Hello?

705
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,410
<i>I'd like to speak
to Mr. Zapruder, please.</i>

706
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,687
This is Abraham Zapruder.

707
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,650
<i>My name is Dick Stolley. I'm
the editor of Life magazine.</i>

708
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,247
<i>I'd like to talk to you
tonight about your film.</i>

709
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,483
You know what? Not tonight.
No. I'm very tired.

710
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,528
I'm upset. It's been
an upsetting day.

711
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,602
I'm sure you can understand.

712
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,444
<i>I understand completely,
but I need to come see you</i>

713
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,925
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

714
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,764
Yeah, tomorrow morning, okay.

715
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,604
<i>Okay, tomorrow morning then.
Thank you.</i>

716
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,920
Sure. Thank you.

717
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,887
Let's go home, Abe. It's enough.
It's enough.

718
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,529
My eyes.

719
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,921
<i>We're about to wind
this up for tonight,</i>

720
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,846
<i>because all that could happen
on one day has.</i>

721
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,244
<i>For some final reflection on
one of the more horrible days</i>

722
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,325
<i>in American history, you find there
is a great deal that could be said</i>

723
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,448
<i>about the political
and other changes</i>

724
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,562
<i>that we can look
forward to now,</i>

725
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,722
<i>but I think it would be
bad taste to go into that now.</i>

726
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,325
<i>And I won't.</i>

727
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,205
<i>It has all been shocking.</i>

728
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,968
<i>By the Washington clock, at a little
after 1 o'clock this afternoon,</i>

729
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:10,286
<i>President Kennedy was alive as any human
being ever gets, young, strong, vigorous,</i>

730
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:15,321
<i>looking forward to, no doubt, 5 more
years, he hoped of leadership in this country</i>

731
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,721
<i>and of the western world.</i>

732
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,327
<i>There is no more news here tonight,
and really no more to say,</i>

733
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:27,089
<i>except that was has happened today has been
just too much, too ugly, and too fast.</i>

734
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,242
Good morning,
I am Dr. Perry.

735
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,641
What seems to be bothering you?

736
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,005
How's our patient doing?
Fine.

737
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,129
And our resident?

738
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,884
Okay, good.

739
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,449
Turn off the lights please.

740
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,851
Jesus Christ.

741
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,805
We blew it.

742
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,370
Shut up!

743
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,240
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

744
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,765
We blew it!

745
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,444
That wasn't a damn
Easter parade,

746
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,522
that's the President
of the United States!

747
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,728
Do you understand me!

748
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,521
You think we need your goddamn
opinion about anything! No, sir.

749
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,810
I've been doing this job for 30 years!
I have never lost my man!

750
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,042
<i>This was not
supposed to happen!</i>

751
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,044
Yesterday, I lost my man.

752
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,607
Thank you, gentlemen, if you would
wait outside for a moment please.

753
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,920
Thank you.

754
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,328
<i>This is no
time to point fingers.</i>

755
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,768
<i>This is a time of...</i>

756
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,488
Dick Stolley.
Life magazine.

757
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,801
We spoke last night. Yeah,
I know who you are.

758
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:41,251
My father brought my family
over here 40 years ago

759
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,845
to escape certain death.

760
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,364
<i>We worked hard,</i>

761
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,570
built a good, honest life.

762
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,361
An American life.

763
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,522
<i>Sir, we'd like to talk to
you about making a deal.</i>

764
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,610
But I guess all
of that is over.

765
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,160
Nothing is ever going
to be the same.

766
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:08,167
I wish I never took
this film, Mr. Stolley.

767
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,720
But now I'm going to
have to live with it.

768
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,968
<i>Don't make a deal without
talking to us first, sir.</i>

769
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,929
I admire you, you know.

770
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,650
I've been to war.

771
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,166
Know what it's like
to use a camera.

772
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,850
You kept shooting.

773
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,329
No, no. It wasn't
a war, Mr. Stolley.

774
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,687
I filmed a murder.

775
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,480
Mr. Zapruder, we're going to slip
an offer underneath the door.

776
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,001
God, if I open this door,

777
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:49,402
it is going to be
impossible for both of us.

778
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,370
Don't make me negotiate
with those people.

779
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,044
Don't make me go out there.

780
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,043
Life magazine is just
as anxious as you are

781
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,088
to give your pictures
a respectable display.

782
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,282
<i>Mr. Zapruder, CBS.</i>

783
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,364
Well, that is why you are standing
in this room, Mr. Stolley,

784
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,728
because I trust that.
I trust your magazine.

785
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,247
And I want to say very clearly

786
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,210
I know what this is,

787
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,123
and what it's done.

788
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,848
What it is going to do.

789
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:25,727
So if you want a chance to do
the right thing with this film

790
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,921
then you're going to
have to pay for it.

791
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,810
You have to pay to keep it safe

792
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,406
and to protect me
and my family.

793
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,971
I think I understand.

794
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,247
And one other thing.

795
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,411
When the President is...
when he's

796
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,005
The kill shot?
Yeah.

797
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,247
You will publish those frames?

798
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,970
Because I think
you would agree,

799
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,281
some things the world
does not need to see.

800
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,725
Would you not?

801
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,250
Normally yes, but in this case

802
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,289
missing frames could lead
to false speculation.

803
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,010
That is none of my business.

804
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,243
I don't... I don't care
about all of that.

805
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,324
I'm talking about
the man's dignity.

806
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,765
<i>We have a responsibility.</i>

807
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,649
A dignified man,
you understand.

808
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,724
It's a very undignified end
for a very dignified man!

809
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,564
You have something to write on?

810
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,530
<i>There is the prisoner.</i>

811
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,924
<i>There is Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

812
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,569
<i>What'?
He has been shot!</i>

813
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,926
<i>He's been shot.</i>

814
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,002
<i>Lee Oswald has been shot!</i>

815
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,605
<i>There's a man with a gun.</i>

816
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,011
Oswald has been shot!
Right now.

817
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,730
Jesus Christ, right on live TV.

818
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,370
<i>God damn!</i>

819
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,488
<i>Absolute panic here
at the basement of the Dallas police headquarters.</i>

820
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,245
<i>Oswald has been shot.</i>

821
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,120
<i>There is no question about it.
Oswald has been shot.</i>

822
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,806
<i>Detectives have
their guns drawn.</i>

823
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,369
We have not heard from
Mr. Stolley or his associates

824
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,081
at Life magazine
since yesterday evening.

825
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,242
And Lee Oswald's wife
and children and I...

826
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,641
are stranded alone
at a strange motel

827
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,370
in the middle of nowhere.

828
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,842
We are waiting to hear
about our cash deal.

829
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:40,169
Thank you. I shall
be waiting right here.

830
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,281
We are the Mrs. Oswalds.

831
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,488
We need money.

832
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,164
We need a place to stay

833
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,924
where we can hide from everyone

834
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,125
and we need a new place
to live, dear heart.

835
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:03,003
All we do is rush around from one place
to another, in the grand exodus.

836
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,447
The baby's diapers are wet.

837
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,000
We are hungry as all get out.
Mother!

838
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,885
<i>Hey, Mike.
Get out here.</i>

839
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,721
Something's going on. They're
running around outside.

840
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:31,447
Don't get excited.
Lee's been shot.

841
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,644
It isn't serious.

842
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,200
And they got the man
who shot him.

843
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,004
Where are they taking him?

844
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,161
Parkland.

845
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,004
No! He is not living or dying
in there. Room two!

846
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,844
How many bullets?
Where's the respirator?

847
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,083
Where's Perry?

848
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,810
Gauze.

849
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,360
There's Clark.
What's the blood pressure?

850
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,965
100 over 85.
It's going down.

851
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,929
I don't like this.
Let's open him up.

852
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,606
We're going to need some suction.
Get suction ready.

853
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,203
From one bullet?
Yeah, one point blank.

854
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,645
Let's start left, go right.

855
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,166
Right kidney gone, spleen gone.

856
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,765
We're going to have to get in there.
Right there.

857
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,491
Need more gauze.
Got it.

858
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,164
BP 100 over 85.

859
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,129
We might get to keep this one.

860
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,282
Do we want to?

861
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,521
We need a confession.

862
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,931
What if he dies?

863
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,843
We need a confession first.

864
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,729
Don't we all.

865
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,131
Damn it!

866
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,470
Blood pressure is going down.

867
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,081
85 over 40. We need more blood!
Nurse.

868
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,924
Zero, nothing.

869
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,611
I've got the lung.
Massage the heart.

870
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,523
Nothing.
Adrenalin now.

871
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,204
Adrenalin!
Come on!

872
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,289
All right, Jim hold it
right there. Open!

873
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,282
Nothing.

874
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,486
Jim, paddles!

875
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,402
Paddles.
Paddles.

876
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,891
Paddles.

877
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:10,962
200.

878
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:11,848
Clear.

879
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,364
Nothing.

880
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,044
Again.
360.

881
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,007
Clear.

882
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,811
Nothing.
Still nothing.

883
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,008
500.
Clear.

884
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,081
Nothing.

885
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,366
700.
Clear.

886
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,207
Time.
1:07.

887
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,361
Dammit.

888
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,684
Yes, this is Mike Howard.

889
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,008
<i>I'm sorry,
will you repeat that?</i>

890
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,645
<i>Thank you.</i>

891
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,406
He's gone?

892
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,290
I'm sorry, Robert.

893
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:26,241
Lee was an agent
for the U.S. government.

894
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,609
He should be buried at Arlington
Cemetery with President Kennedy.

895
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,250
Shut up, mother.

896
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,247
He's staying here.

897
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,927
This time, I don't think anyone's
going to give you a hard time.

898
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,691
Your name is Robert.
Is that right, son?

899
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,640
That's right.

900
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,882
I'm sorry for you.

901
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,003
I'm sorry for everybody.

902
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,888
...<i>a brief stop
at the White House.</i>

903
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,282
<i>Then Mrs. Kennedy followed
the casket on foot...</i>

904
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,089
<i>to St. Matthews Church.</i>

905
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,290
I don't think you all
should listen to this.

906
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,885
No, please leave it.

907
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,560
Thank you.

908
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:57,805
Bring him in.

909
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:59,405
Close the blinds for me.

910
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,003
We're getting killed, Jim.

911
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,249
<i>What happened in this office...</i>

912
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:24,282
What we did...
what you did...

913
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,600
What do you want, Gordon?

914
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,804
You were in the military,
right, Jim?

915
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,928
<i>Yeah, Army.</i>

916
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,331
Are you firing me?

917
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,689
<i>I don't ever
want to see that again.</i>

918
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,121
What the hell am I
supposed to do with it?

919
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:54,730
Oswald's dead now.
A thousand what-ifs.

920
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,730
86 'em.

921
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,284
This is evidence.

922
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,040
Well it's not evidence
if there's no trial.

923
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,527
And there sure as shit
won't be a trial now.

924
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,649
<i>I know what that is, Jim.</i>

925
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,484
<i>I'm asking you to destroy it.</i>

926
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,687
I think we all know
what is at stake here.

927
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,484
<i>Wait...</i>

928
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,571
You want this?

929
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,249
Why aren't we doing this
in the church?

930
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,320
Well, no church will do it.

931
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,283
What about that cemetery
chapel over there?

932
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,811
They won't allow it either.

933
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,724
You only have this grave site
because a friend owed me a favor.

934
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,247
And I'm sorry, but there
are no pullbearers.

935
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:15,404
Can you help us, please?

936
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,450
Thank you.

937

God of the open sky
and of the infinite universe,

944
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:54,927
<i>we pray and petition for this
family who are heartbroken.</i>

945
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,846
<i>Those who suffer and in his
hearts are full of fears.</i>

946
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,922
<i>We'll pray for them.</i>

947
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,480
For their need is great.

948
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,446
May God have mercy
on your soul.

949
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,884
...<i>or if these dark
days are harbingers</i>

950
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,042
<i>of even blacker ones to come,</i>

951
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,367
<i>Might the black
before the dawn...</i>

952
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,047
<i>lead to some still
as yet indiscernible sunrise</i>

953
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,361
<i>of understanding among men.</i>

954
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,728
<i>Violent words, no matter what
their origin or motivation...</i>

955
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,961
Hail Mary, full of grace,

956
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,690
the Lord is with thee.

957
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,169
<i>Blessed art thou amongst women,</i>

958
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,607
<i>and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

959
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,682
<i>Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,</i>

960
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,603
<i>now and at the hour
of our death.</i>

961
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,248
<i>Tonight, there
will be few Americans</i>

962
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,288
<i>who will go to bed
without carrying with them</i>

963
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,563
<i>the sense that somehow
they have failed.</i>

964
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,688
<i>If in the search
of our conscience</i>

965
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,286
<i>we find a new dedication
to the American concept</i>

966
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:27,321
<i>that brook no political, sectional,
religious or racial divisions.</i>

967
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,928
<i>And it may yet be possible to
say that John Fitzgerald Kennedy</i>

968
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,241
<i>did not die in vain.</i>

969
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:39,167
<i>That's the way it is,
Monday, November 25th, 1963.</i>

970
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,049
<i>This is Walter Cronkite.
Good night.</i>
