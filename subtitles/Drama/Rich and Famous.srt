1
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,520
Merry?
Where did you go?

2
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,320
What are you doing in the closet?

3
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,960
l thought it was the housemother.

4
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,640
For God's sake,
the taxi's waiting.

5
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,840
-Come on. Are you ready?
-l'm ready.

6
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,920
-Are you taking him?
-You think it's silly?

7
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,920
Just because
you don't want to graduate.

8
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
He's been here three and a half years.
Maybe he'd like to.

9
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,000
l couldn't leave Hamburger.
He's been my family...

10
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,880
-...ever since l was little.
-Come on.

11
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,960
Give me this.

12
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,160
-Liz?
-Yeah?

13
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,280
l guess he could stay and be
some sort of company.

14
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,640
lt's okay.

15
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,040
-Come on, Merry.
-Okay, okay.

16
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,160
Liz, tell me.
Aren't you just a little bit jealous?

17
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,840
Are you crazy?

18
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,600
Well, in a way, Doug's far more
your type than mine, you know.

19
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,240
He likes the same old boring books.

20
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,360
A real brain.

21
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,720
Did l tell you he started smoking a pipe?

22
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,320
l swear on everything you consider
holy, l do not envy you and Doug.

23
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,600
Well, he was your date.

24
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,160
Oh, Liz. Next time we meet l'm gonna
be a married lady.

25
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,360
What do you think?

26
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,520
l'm gonna be an unmarried lady.

27
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,600
There he is.

28
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,480
Doug.

29
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,520
Doug.

30
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
Hi.

31
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,840
Hello, Doug.

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,120
-You been good?
-Flawless.

33
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,040
Do you see what l mean?

34
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,160
We better go.

35
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,640
l'm not stealing your roommate.
She's following me...

36
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,080
...all the way to California.

37
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,600
Yeah. You rats.

38
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,320
Have a wonderful life...

39
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,720
.. .trip, everything.

40
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,360
You owe me one.

41
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,600
To talk about debuts being auspicious...

42
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,080
...is to talk about the career
of Liz Hamilton.

43
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,520
She came to our attention with her
very first novel, Night Song.

44
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,200
A remarkable achievement.. .

45
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,960
...because it won
the National Writer's Award...

46
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,280
...and she was then only early
in her 20s.

47
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,960
Since then her essays have appeared
in reviews and in journals.

48
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,440
And her second novel is promised
to us for later this year.

49
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
Or maybe early next year in 1 970...

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,760
...if she gets to it.

51
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,320
Oh, look. Oh, God.

52
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,400
-Although she doesn't identify...
-Hi. Liz.

53
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,440
.. .herself specifically
with feminist politics.. .

54
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,000
...her works are themselves
an evocation of the feminine life.

55
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,480
A plea for the feminine ethic...

56
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,880
...a demand for a space to be
just that, female.

57
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,160
l'm very pleased that she's with us
today.

58
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,840
Please, help me greet Liz Hamilton.

59
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,120
Thank you.

60
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,880
My sincere thanks to Professor Fields.

61
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,800
My thanks, also definitely sincere,
to the Women's Caucus.. .

62
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,800
...for sending me a ticket
to come to this warm climate.

63
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,560
And receive such a warm reception.

64
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,400
l'm not sure it's an exclusively
feminine instinct...

65
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,440
...but l need a lot of warmth.

66
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,400
Perhaps it is true, as
Professor Fields has said...

67
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,080
...that l do not involve myself
specifically in feminist politics.

68
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,640
Why not?

69
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,960
Perhaps l am too exclusively
involved in work.

70
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,600
That is, in writing and the paralysis
that seems to come with it.

71
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,800
l don't know why it is, but writers,
many writers.. .

72
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,080
...must face some daily barrier of fear.

73
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
But then, a dear old man,
James M. Cain said that:

74
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,760
''lf your writing doesn't keep
you up nights...

75
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,840
I I
...it won't keep anyone else up either.

76
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
l have a confession to make.

77
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,560
All my life, l've had a love for old men.

78
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,400
My father was old when l was born.

79
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,880
Older still, when he died.

80
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,880
My first novel was a memory of him.

81
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,880
And l am damn sure
not going to apologize for that.

82
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,400
And this is, sort of,
the entertaining area.

83
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,440
lt's just a little thing,
but, you know...

84
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,640
...little tiny houses out here
on the beach...

85
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,760
...they cost as much as a mansion
down home.

86
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,080
-Doug.
-Hi, Daddy.

87
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,400
ln case you've forgotten,
that handsome man is my husband.

88
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,880
-Well, what do you think?
-What?

89
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,400
-My house.
-Terrific.

90
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Doug resents we don't
still live near the lab.

91
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,880
But l could not take it,
l tell you, Pasadena.

92
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,800
Go see your daddy.

93
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,000
Look, honey, look who's here.

94
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,520
-Hi.
-Hi, Doug.

95
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,800
-You're looking great.
-Oh, you're the one.

96
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,360
-You're beautiful.
-ls she?

97
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,560
Let me look?

98
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,040
Oh, my God. You don't look bad.
And a celebrity too.

99
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Debby, take your hands
out of your pants.

100
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,560
You should have seen the admiration
of all those girls.

101
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,280
Debby, we all have interesting things
under our clothes...

102
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
...but we don't stand around
and pick at them.

103
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,680
So you were a big hit on campus.

104
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,480
They tarred, but did not feather me.

105
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,360
What we call boffo box office.

106
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,160
Oh, now Douglas, don't you start.

107
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
Here in Malibu,
we all talk show-biz talk.

108
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,960
Liz is not interested
in any Hollywood silliness.

109
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,240
She's a New York authoress.
Right, hon?

110
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,120
She takes her coffee every day
at the Plaza Hotel, Palm Court.

111
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,840
And she eats her steaks at
the Four Seasons on Park Avenue.

112
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
l'm impressed.

113
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,320
l take my coffee to go
at a deli on Sixth Avenue.

114
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,800
l'm even more impressed.

115
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,120
lf he had his way, we'd be over
at Caltech all the time.

116
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,520
But those college people,
they're like Atlantics.. .

117
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,960
...except they lie even more.

118
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,920
When do l get to see more
of your husband?

119
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,640
Later.
We're having a party for you.

120
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,320
And he's agreed not to work
for just a minute or two.

121
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
A party?

122
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,400
You're my only friend
who's a celebrity.

123
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,480
-A very minor celebrity, Merry.
-Oh, hell.

124
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,360
lt'll do these folks good.
They're all such major ones.

125
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Oh, Liz, honey, look, this is Kent.

126
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,200
This is Kent, this is Liz.

127
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,240
Hi.

128
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,240
Don't fall all over yourself
because it just embarrasses him.

129
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,640
Don't worry. l only know
how to embarrass myself.

130
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,880
l'm sorry l haven't read any
of your books.

131
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,240
Oh, there's only been one.

132
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,520
But, it's marvelous though,
even the parts l don't understand.

133
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,560
What parts?

134
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Parts unknown.

135
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,960
-lsn't she special?
-But, Merry, wait, l, l--

136
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,600
How're you doing?

137
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,560
-l'm drunk.
-Let me catch up.

138
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,960
You shouldn't be talking to the help.
Half of Hollywood's here.

139
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,520
Yeah?

140
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,360
You wanna go for a walk?

141
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,760
-You get time off?
-She likes me to rebel now and again.

142
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,440
Hey, your turn.

143
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,240
l'm right in the middle of a story.

144
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,240
How's the book coming?

145
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,520
Well, the first hundred pages?
Terrific.

146
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,800
l've written them over five times
in five years.

147
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,400
ls that how you normally write?

148
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,880
l don't write normally.

149
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,000
l'm what is called blocked.
Isn't that humorless?

150
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,560
What about the Frenchman?

151
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,440
You still into him?

152
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,200
lnto him? You talk hippie talk?

153
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,480
That's California talk, l think.

154
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
Are you?

155
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,200
l used to be very young.

156
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,000
Paris was very old.

157
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,640
He was intense. l was shy.

158
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,520
-He did all the work.
-And now?

159
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,560
They ought to warn you before
they let you fall in love.

160
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,400
l mean, for the first time.

161
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,000
You can pick the God-awfullest one.

162
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,440
And you don't recover.
Not from the first. Never.

163
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,880
What comes after the Frenchman?

164
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,280
Nothing for the moment.

165
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,480
l got no lover, but l got a therapist.

166
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,960
Now, that's humorless.

167
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,440
Well, he says, ''When l start writing
again, l'll start loving.''

168
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,280
What he said was, ''fucking again.''

169
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
Excuse me, Doug, the man's a Freudian.

170
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,040
Maybe it's the other way.
Start loving, you'll start writing.

171
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,760
-l suggested that.
-What'd he say?

172
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,880
He said, not writing was my problem.

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,280
We missing the party?

174
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,640
-The party's over.
-l'm sorry.

175
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,560
lt's the habit of this community
to be suspicious.

176
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,640
When a married man goes off
with a married woman's best friend...

177
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,720
...that's the occasion for suspicion.

178
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:04,640
We better move, because l'm not
changing my habits.

179
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,000
lt's my fault.

180
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,040
You know that. Anyway. tomorrow night
David Steinberg will be here.

181
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,280
And on Friday. Joe Mamath.
who's gonna be a--

182
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,040
Joe will not do a monologue.
because it takes him too--

183
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,200
Kiss? l'm not mad at you anymore.

184
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,600
-Better.
-That's my best.

185
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,160
-Thank you, Doug.
-Thank you.

186
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,000
Good night.

187
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,720
-Good night, honey.
-Good night.

188
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,120
Merry, thank you.

189
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,520
What for?

190
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
For being there.

191
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,440
One year l come running from Paris,
and you-- You're there.

192
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,760
Another time, l want to crawl into
a hole until the reviews come out...

193
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,680
...you open the door.

194
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,160
And the party.

195
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, that little party. Forget it.

196
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,320
l always thought if my books were
a success, l would buy you a mink coat.

197
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,640
-Sable.
-All right, sable.

198
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,520
Well, it was a big success.
You were in Newsweek, honey.

199
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,520
There's a lot of broke people
in Newsweek.

200
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,640
Some of these movie folk here
knew your name.

201
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,080
They're all rich and famous.

202
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,640
You're just famous. That's harder to do.

203
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,840
All the good things happen to you.

204
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,480
Handsome husband.

205
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,520
A beautiful little girl.

206
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,400
And you know how to sew.

207
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,760
-Are you gonna drink?
-Just a little.

208
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,440
Why?

209
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,960
l wanted to talk.

210
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,320
l can drink and talk. Go.

211
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,400
Liz, honey, l'm so proud of the way
you turned yourself out.

212
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,360
l sound like a table leg.

213
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,400
l mean, what do l do? l sit here
and sew like my grandmother...

214
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,760
...and kiss my husband goodbye
on his way to work.

215
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,200
Have tea with Rock Hudson.

216
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,440
Oh, you know, they are just folks here.

217
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
They all got problems
same as you and me.

218
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,520
We could debate that.

219
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,160
You take that nice fella,
my little neighbor next door.

220
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,240
That fellow may be just
a neighbor to you...

221
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,400
...but he shows up in a lot
of ladies' dreams.

222
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,760
Well, that is just the point.

223
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,640
Just because he is a star actor,
doesn't mean he's happy.

224
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,280
He's always moping around,
coming in here for tuna fish.

225
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
He has got lots of time to sit
home and worry.

226
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,280
-About what?
-He's had three wives.

227
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,120
Not one of them worth spit.

228
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,320
He has become far too familiar
with drugs...

229
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,200
...some of which he puts up his nose.

230
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,120
Here, just let me find the part
about Kent.

231
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,600
Here's the part about--
Here, this is the part about Kent.

232
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,520
Well, maybe l-- Maybe l better start
at the beginning.

233
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,680
Start what?

234
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
-What is this?
-Well.

235
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,960
Liz, l know this sounds silly
but this is a novel.

236
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,440
This whole box.

237
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,760
How wonderful.

238
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,080
Oh, no.

239
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,200
lt doesn't have all the commas
in place like yours...

240
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,520
...but it is something l feel real
serious about.

241
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,760
You know, these folks around here,
they come and they sit on this beach.

242
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,040
And it is no different from down home.

243
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,880
They got problems, honey,
and they tell them to me.

244
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,360
Because l like to listen.

245
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,960
And then you, you write about them?

246
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,920
Well, l changed all the names.

247
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,920
-Oh, good.
-You don't wanna hear this?

248
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,200
Let me read, it's easier.

249
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,200
No, it's such a mess.
l better read it.

250
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,440
-The whole thing?
-Oh, Liz, would you mind?

251
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's just start and see
how far we get, okay?

252
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,000
You're gonna hate this but, okay?

253
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,480
Okay.

254
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,000
lt's got a title.

255
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,200
lt's called _ Ho_se _y the Sea.

256
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,280
You know, to make you think of Malibu.

257
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,880
''This was a first for Laurelle Jordan.

258
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,040
Her first trip to New York,
her first visit to the Plaza Hotel.

259
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,080
Being a girl from Dallas, she marched
into that hotel drinking room...

260
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,000
...with all the arrogance of
Texas money.''

261
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,280
-You're not getting drunk are you?
-l'm listening.

262
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,840
''As she sat there fingering the olive
in her crystal clear drink...

263
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
...she was wearing a hat in the shape
of a Stetson.

264
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,480
But this was no cowboy hat.
It was made of mink.

265
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,720
The little animals who gave up
their lives to make her hat...

266
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,040
...had all come of age in Siberia.

267
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,240
There was the sand at her feet...

268
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
...and as many as the grains
of that sand...

269
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,320
...were the memories of her years...

270
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,320
...Brad, Elliot, Gerald...

271
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,600
...in and out of her life as the tide
that came now to wash at her feet.

272
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,480
'Gone_ seemed to say the lapping tide,
all gone.

273
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,080
But her memories and this,
her simple house by the sea.''

274
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,000
Was it okay?

275
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,800
Why do they always end up alone?

276
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,680
Who?

277
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,600
Those ladies, in those stories,
they always end up alone.

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,640
You liked it?

279
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,200
lt knocked me out.

280
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,520
ls that good?

281
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,840
The Mona Lisa never knocked me out.

282
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,280
-Do you want some coffee?
-Got any more Scotch?

283
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,680
Haven't you had enough?

284
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,560
A nightcap. A morningcap.

285
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,400
l don't want you to tell me any lies, Liz.

286
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,080
Don't worry. l need to get sleep
before l can tell a believable lie.

287
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,760
Did you like my book?

288
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,640
How long did it take you
to write it?

289
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,520
Oh, almost a year. Let's see...

290
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
...l started just after Debby went--

291
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:38,960
Well, eight months, in the afternoons.

292
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,000
Eight months in the afternoons?

293
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,960
What are you gonna do with it?
Get it published?

294
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,480
l was going to ask you.

295
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,040
Go ahead. Ask.

296
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,680
l don't like your tone, Liz.

297
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,160
What is wrong with my tone?

298
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:54,000
The New York Review of Books
said l was a master of irony.

299
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,400
Oh, drink your gin and go to sleep.

300
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,080
You want me to show the book
to Jules Levi.

301
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
Well, l want you to do whatever
you think is right.

302
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,880
Jules Levi is the wrong man
for you, Merry.

303
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,040
Why?

304
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,800
Too much important tailoring. He's like
an apple the butler polishes every day.

305
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,200
He's the most impressive publisher
in the business.

306
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,520
Let's say he's impressed.

307
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Liz, would you--?

308
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:19,760
Would you show it to Jules Levi...

309
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,760
...and tell him it not be like
some translation from the Russian?

310
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,640
l haven't escaped from the
iron curtain or anything...

311
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,160
-...but l do know what it feels--
-To have feelings.

312
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,320
You know what it feels like
to have feelings.

313
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,080
-l suppose.
-lt is not a supposition.

314
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,920
lt is a fact,
from the master of irony.

315
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,280
Merry knows what it feels like
to have feelings.

316
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,000
That is worth money in the pocket.

317
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,840
But not Jules Levi's pocket.

318
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
He doesn't have any pockets.

319
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,480
-Too much expensive tailoring.
-Why not Jules Levi?

320
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
Jules Levi is interested in something
called serious art. Serious art.

321
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,120
Ask him and he'll tell you.

322
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,840
There are only two markets for serious
art: homosexuals and Jews.

323
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,600
-That's an ugly thing to say.
-What? Homosexual or Jew?

324
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,760
l could smack your face
and not even feel it.

325
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,600
Another gin and l wouldn't either.

326
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,400
What's wrong with me writing a book?
Makes you so jealous, huh?

327
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,600
Nothing.

328
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:10,000
What is wrong with learning to bounce
balls on your nose eight months?

329
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,360
Maybe l should learn to bounce balls
on my nose. Balls, l should.

330
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,440
l'm too busy writing and rewriting
my first hundred pages...

331
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:20,560
.. .for that famous apple-polished,
impressed and impressive publisher.

332
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,360
He has been waiting years for what
they call my second effort.

333
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,600
Do you know what it is to be blocked?

334
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,800
Could you develop a few hang-ups?

335
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,440
Don't you wanna write major art?

336
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,720
And knock them out
at the local gay Hadassah?

337
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,360
Why are you all shouting?

338
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,960
Liz is just being a simple bitch,
is what we call it down home.

339
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,640
Well, we're not down home.
We're way out West.

340
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,000
And quit quoting Atlanta as though
it were gospel.

341
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,920
Atlanta has fallen.
Haven't you heard?

342
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,000
Sherman has spared us
any further wisdom...

343
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,040
.. .from that quotable capital
of the South.

344
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
Give us a quote from Paris, France
then, Miss Smarty.

345
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:54,960
Okay.

346
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,600
ln Paris in France they had a guy
who was, for the record...

347
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,960
...both a homosexual and a Jew.

348
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,120
Who wrote a seven-volume book they
continue to refer to as a masterpiece.

349
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,640
Who was such nitro-glycerin
in the head.. .

350
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,040
...that he had to hide out
in a cork-lined room...

351
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,960
...or else he'd have
gone up in shrapnel.

352
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,160
Proust, Marcel Proust.

353
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,800
He had the good grace
to suffer for his art.

354
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,240
And didn't push aside
the tuna fish sandwiches...

355
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
...on his Formica kitchen table
to write it.

356
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,040
Has anybody slept around here?

357
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,200
Liz Hamilton, it is my duty
to remind you of a promise...

358
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,840
...you extracted from me
early in our careers in college.

359
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,640
You made me promise to tell you
if you ever went too far...

360
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,400
...and were in danger of hurting me.

361
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,600
Well, you are too far right now.
Apologize.

362
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,440
l apologize.

363
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,200
Tell her l apologize for a basic
Iack of honesty.

364
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,720
You have been lying.

365
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,800
Not yet. l would only be lying
if l let you believe...

366
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,560
...it was merely Scotch or gin that are
making me do what l am about to do.

367
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,160
What are you about to do?

368
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,120
Vomit.

369
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,160
She liked my book.

370
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,720
Don't worry, l'll get some sleep
on the plane, l guess.

371
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,680
Oh, give these back to Merry.

372
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,920
And, tell her, thank you.

373
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,200
l wish l understood you two.

374
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,280
Why should you know the secret?
We don't.

375
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,600
Thank you.

376
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,560
l'm just sorry.

377
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,280
Why? You've been behaving
like a normal human being.

378
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,280
l'm sorry you don't live around here.

379
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,800
You are?

380
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,480
lt'd be nice for Merry having a friend.

381
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,680
Oh, some friend.

382
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,040
You're okay.

383
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,680
Bye, Doug.

384
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,280
Thanks.

385
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,560
<i>- Airlines, flight 174...</i>

386
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
.. .for St. Louis and Houston.. .

387
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,240
<i>... will depart from gate 30.</i>

388
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,600
Are you not drinking?

389
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,280
Not this trip, thanks.

390
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,360
l don't think she's drinking.

391
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,920
A little wine.
That doesn't count.

392
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,880
-Well, don't blame me.
-No, you are blameless.

393
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,160
Thanks.

394
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,840
lt was hard at first.
Sure, it's an adjustment.

395
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,080
l can't imagine.

396
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:41,000
lt must be really horrible in its way.

397
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,480
For example, l've never been able
to take this off.

398
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,960
How old was she?

399
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:50,040
lf you don't mind saying?

400
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:51,960
Twenty-nine.

401
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
l'm just two years older.

402
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,920
Any kids?

403
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,760
No. Thank God for that.

404
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:08,200
You ever known a guy--?

405
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,480
Have you ever known a guy who
Ioved you so much...

406
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,880
...that he'd run up the stairs because
he couldn't wait for the elevator?

407
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,880
You ran up the stairs for your wife?

408
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,040
Sometimes.

409
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:26,120
l've never lived in an elevator building.

410
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,160
lt can be nice.

411
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,920
What?

412
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,200
Would you like one last drink
before our approach to Kennedy?

413
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,880
Kennedy?

414
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,320
No. Thank you.

415
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,560
Oh, excuse me.

416
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,120
Sorry.

417
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,640
Oh, sorry.

418
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,640
The captain has turned on
the no smoking sign in preparation.. .

419
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,360
.. .for our landing at Kennedy.

420
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,920
We ask at this time that
you return to your seats...

421
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,000
.. .and extinguish all smoking materials.

422
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,080
At this time we would like to request
that you put your seatbacks...

423
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,960
.. .in full upright position. make sure
all carry-on luggage.. .

424
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,480
.. .is securely under your seat.

425
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:26,440
The sound you hear is the landing
gear locking into place.. .

426
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,240
.. .and is a normal part of our flight.

427
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:45,680
The sound you hear is
the captain reversing engines.. .

428
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,040
.. .to retard our forward motion
and is a normal part of our procedure.

429
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,680
On behalf of Captain Price
and the entire flight crew.. .

430
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:57,080
...we want to welcome you
to the Mew York area...

431
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,640
...and to thank you for flying TWA.

432
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:02,520
We hope your trip has been pleasurable.

433
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,720
l work in the city and maybe we could--

434
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,800
You know, l don't even know
your last name.

435
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,560
Max, some things are perfect
just as they are.

436
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,880
-Well, what if l give you my number?
-Well....

437
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,720
Daddy, Daddy.

438
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,400
Max, darling. Max, thank God.
l thought we missed you, honey.

439
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,280
The kids fought all the way down
the Saw Mill River Parkway.

440
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,640
l wanted to surprise you...

441
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,800
...but it wouldn't have been
much of a surprise if we'd missed you.

442
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,080
-Can l help you?
-Oh, no, no. No, thanks.

443
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,200
l've been helped quite enough
for one day.

444
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,120
Come on, let's go.
l made this wonderful dinner.

445
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,960
You're just gonna love it.

446
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,080
Jules.

447
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,800
Welcome home, dove.
That is a tan.

448
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,800
Most New Yorkers never get out
of the Polo Lounge out there.

449
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,520
-l passed out on the beach a lot.
-Five years.

450
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,320
l've always had to call you.

451
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,480
l felt like a rejected suitor.
At last you call me.

452
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,280
With your manuscript. Unbelievable.

453
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Not quite.

454
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,720
-What are you drinking?
-Scotch and water.

455
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
Another martini for you, Mr. Levi?

456
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,920
When a writer calls her publisher,
it's usually love or money.

457
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,760
-They're out of one or the other.
-Well, Jules it's neither.

458
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,880
-You have some money left?
-Yeah.

459
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,240
You're not in love?

460
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,440
No, l've lost my resilience
in that department.

461
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,600
How do you mean?

462
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,240
Well, my trust, which at best has always
been minimal, is now entirely gone.

463
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,520
Nothing ventured.

464
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,920
l've never found anyone to compare
with you, Jules.

465
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,560
What's wrong with the original?
Try him, terrific.

466
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,400
-Sarah says so.
-Sarah who?

467
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:04,560
Your wife, Sarah.

468
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,560
l don't know why so many attractive
Iadies are more concerned...

469
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,800
...about my wife's feelings
than mine. Your novel.

470
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:13,720
This isn't mine.

471
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,960
l thought you said you were closing in
on it, on the finish?

472
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,400
l am closing in on it. But--

473
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,000
Since l came back,
l've been possessed with work.

474
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,640
-A couple hours a day l'm possessed.
-Then, what is this?

475
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,440
This is by a friend.

476
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:32,160
My oldest friend. Truly a friend.
l think it has potential.

477
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,640
Give it to Allan for a read.

478
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,440
No, l want you to read it
as a favor.

479
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,640
What's it about?

480
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Feelings.

481
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,400
What kind of feelings?

482
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,520
The kind of feelings they have in Malibu.

483
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,480
Malibu.

484
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,520
Just because l'm from the South.
every time l open my mouth.. .

485
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,760
.. .some Yankee thinks l sound stupid.

486
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,440
Why? Because of the accent?
Well. l don't care.

487
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,320
l'm not gonna curl up
like some salted slug.

488
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,400
l'm proud to be from Atlanta.

489
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,960
l read Gone With the Wind twice a year.

490
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,000
Twice a year. when Merry Moel Blake
takes down Margaret Mitchell's.. .

491
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,800
.. .phenomenal bestseller to read.
it's not just to be reminded of home.

492
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,240
She may be comparing royalties.

493
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,000
Ever since her first book.. .

494
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,680
...A House by the Sea, went thro_gh
Hollywood like a cannon shot...

495
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,200
...mowing down about half the film
colony with its deadly exposé...

496
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,680
.. .she has established herself
as more than a writer.

497
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,840
This prolific woman. with five torrid
bestsellers. one after the other...

498
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,280
.. .has become a. kind of.
publishing institution.

499
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
But at what a cost.

500
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,760
l've always loved Merry.
She's a good kid.

501
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,680
You don't feel that there's a slightly
altered portrait of you then. in her book?

502
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,680
Mow. do l look like the kind
of a guy that-- Teenage girls?

503
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,880
l mean. once in a while. some poor
schnook could get carried away.

504
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,440
But. l mean. with all
of the daughters of all of his...

505
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,000
.. .friends? Including the daughter
of the studio head?

506
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,520
God. somebody's gotta be
a fruitcake to do that.

507
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,440
lt's not true then that your attorney
is bringing suit against her?

508
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,160
Mah. l'm sorry to see Merry move out
of the colony.

509
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,360
We should mention.
that's the Malibu Colony.

510
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,400
And that's where the first novel is set.

511
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,880
Why did she leave Malibu?

512
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,800
l don t know.
Some guy set fire to her car.

513
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,880
lt's hard to imagine that
the stately pyramids along the Nile.. .

514
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,720
.. .or the sphinx with its mysterious
smile. could have--

515
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,960
You're gonna miss this.

516
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,680
lt's a rerun. You've seen it once.

517
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,000
Make me one too.

518
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,240
What do you want?

519
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,080
Half of whatever you're drinking.

520
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,160
--that you use a nom de plume.

521
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,520
l was a Christmas surprise to my mama
so she named me Merry Noel...

522
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,440
.. .you know. M-E-R-R-Y.

523
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,080
All the folks down home call me
Merry Noel to this day.

524
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,920
ln her second book. CIeo...

525
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:57,280
.. .Merry Blake imagines a modern day
Cleopatra. who comes to America.. .

526
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,960
...and falls in love. and in fact.
into bed. with a chief executive...

527
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:04,760
-...who looks like our own Gerald Ford.
-There's your half.

528
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,360
-Do you wanna go to New York?
-Nope.

529
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,160
l'm booked on
to The Merv Griffin Show.

530
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,960
-What would l do?
-What do you do here?

531
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
l'm sorry.

532
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,800
l know how you like to affix blame...

533
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,280
...but l did not close down the project.
The lab did.

534
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,160
l said, l'm sorry.

535
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,520
Sometimes words just slide out
of my mouth.

536
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,280
Like a snake out of its hole.

537
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,800
Home Cookin'.

538
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,520
You like it?

539
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,600
That's it.
That's the title.

540
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,800
Home Cookin'.

541
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,080
lt's gonna be about Mama.

542
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,720
l keep trying to remember why it was
she kept going off to see Papa.

543
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,800
She had been married
three more times...

544
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,000
...and she was living
with her third husband.

545
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,600
And she snuck off to a motel
to see Papa.

546
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,880
She was 60.

547
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,960
My God, she was driven.

548
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,200
-l wonder.
-What?

549
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,360
She must have loved Papa.

550
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,680
You never recover from the first person
you fall in love with.

551
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,960
-Doug, you know that?
-No.

552
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,480
-Well, you said it.
-Liz told me.

553
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,640
-You and Liz talked about love?
-We did.

554
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,720
-When?
-Some years ago.

555
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:05,680
Doug, honey, Doug, could you
excuse me one minute? Just a second.

556
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,920
l'll be right back.
Hon, l'll be right back.

557
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,440
You just-- l'll be right back.

558
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,080
One second, okay? l've just gotta--

559
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,000
Dougy.

560
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,520
l'm sorry.

561
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,080
Doug-bug?

562
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,920
-l thought you wanted to--?
-l finished.

563
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,040
Without me?

564
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,320
l only feel, Merv, that you can only be
honest when you do something.

565
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,320
You have to do it,
speak from the heart...

566
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,800
...you have to tell it like it is.
That's how l feel.

567
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,640
-You have a daughter, don't you?
-l do, yes, l do, she's 14.

568
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,920
l wonder, Merry Noel, what advice
you give her about boys?

569
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,200
Oh, well, l just tell her
what my mama told me.

570
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,800
l just tell her, if you think
too much about boys...

571
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,520
...you get on the back of a horse.

572
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,320
Quite a philosopher, your mama.

573
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,560
She was, yes.

574
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:58,880
Did you do a lot of horseback riding
as a youngster?

575
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:01,120
Oh, no, l didn't Merv.
l don't like horses.

576
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,040
They're so big,
but l like jockeys.

577
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,760
Do you?

578
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,160
You're early.

579
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,440
Hi, Doug.

580
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:15,240
-You're not at The Merv Griffin Show?
-l stepped out for a drink.

581
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,480
-l was about to have one myself.
-Me too.

582
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,240
l thought you were sticking
with Merry.

583
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,320
She can never find her way down here.

584
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,320
She can figure out how to find a local
bookstore in Satsuma, Florida.

585
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
l'm not worried.

586
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,440
l haven't figured out whether
l like you better drunk or sober.

587
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,600
No Scotch?

588
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,080
Next to the typewriter.

589
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:45,640
l forgot the literary process.

590
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,920
You're almost right.

591
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:49,080
l was having drinks with a novelist.

592
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,480
That is literary, isn't it?

593
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,640
The novelist?
Are you still seeing him?

594
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,560
-No.
-His wife came back into the picture?

595
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:59,600
-No.
-You're not talking?

596
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
lf there was something to talk about.

597
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,000
Poor Liz.

598
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:14,800
l finally figured out after three,
what is it...

599
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,000
...three and a half,
on-again off-again years...

600
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:21,480
...that my friend Paul essentially
considers me an interruption.

601
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,120
To his otherwise important thoughts.

602
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,480
Poor Liz.

603
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,000
Don't worry. l took his best years.

604
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,920
Please God, don't let me burn that bird.

605
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,640
All the times we've been back here,
l've never seen you in the kitchen.

606
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,200
l don't go in the kitchen.
The roaches talk about me.

607
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,720
l'm thinking about moving back here.

608
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,560
l'm not afraid of cockroaches.

609
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,920
You're kidding?

610
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,320
They run when l turn on the light.
They're afraid of me.

611
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,160
l mean about moving back here.

612
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,760
There's an opening at the Rockefeller
Institute. l'm going in to see them.

613
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,160
-Does Merry want to live in New York?
-l don't know. l never asked her.

614
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,400
-Well, don't you think you should?
-Liz.

615
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,600
l have this fantasy that if l work
back here l can come by.

616
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,240
-You can incinerate a bird.
-Where is Merry going to be?

617
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
-She can fly in between books.
-Oh, yeah.

618
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:18,640
That's what she does,
flies in between books.

619
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,560
-Naughty.
-Hey, l can cook.

620
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:23,080
Did l tell you? l used to read
Gourmet Magazine.

621
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,720
Let me ask you something--

622
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,800
l'm thinking, if l get a place
back here...

623
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,080
...l can cook duck or cherries jubilee.

624
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:32,720
-That sounds fun.
-And invite you.

625
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,440
You're thinking, you can move away
from Merry...

626
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:42,840
...between books and invite her
oldest friend over for duck?

627
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,160
And cherries jubilee.

628
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:48,320
And then what?

629
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,280
-Where does your fantasy go from there?
-l told you way back in college...

630
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,000
...when l started going with Merry,
if there ever came a time--

631
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,440
You promised you'd never
mention that again.

632
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
l lied.

633
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,240
That's Merry, Doug.

634
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,880
Doug.

635
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,400
The limousine driver had no idea
where Minetta Lane was.

636
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:34,160
He had to stop and ask a cab.

637
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,160
l got so darn angry l took the cab...

638
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,880
...and then that damn fool couldn't even
find the Village.

639
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:41,360
Goddamn it. l see you found your way
down here.

640
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,080
-Liz has some wonderful Scotch.
-You want a drink, Merry?

641
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:46,400
l don't. He doesn't.
Why do you give him liquor?

642
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,280
She also sacrificed a chicken.

643
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Great, great. You're drunk.
That's just great.

644
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,960
-l'll get it.
-No, l got it.

645
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,240
-l'll get it.
-Goddamn it.

646
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:00,080
Well, l took a Dexamyl
and cleaned house today.

647
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,800
You did all this in one day?

648
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,120
Oh, the dexie did it.
l just watched.

649
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:17,560
Good night.

650
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
-Where are you going?
-Back to the hotel.

651
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,720
-Why?
-l've got an interview tomorrow.

652
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,040
l wanna go and drink myself
to sleep. Alone.

653
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,160
Do you have any idea
how far away you are...

654
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,640
-...from sleeping on park benches?
-Come on, Merry.

655
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,880
l wish you weren't always ready
with a Scotch...

656
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:33,760
...and a back scratch for poor Doug.

657
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,600
''Poor Doug'' likes his
back scratched.

658
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,000
lt is, l am told, the spirits
of affection...

659
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:40,240
...and not the distillery that comfort
the soul.

660
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,280
-Brother!
-Could you please help in that?

661
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,480
This is not Bellevue.

662
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:47,440
l do not accept responsibility
for the toxic level of my guests.

663
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,400
You cannot imagine
what it's been like...

664
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,440
...since he drank himself out of his job.

665
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,360
Bullshit. l never drank to do my job
at the lab.

666
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:56,400
l only drink to perform my job
as husband.

667
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:58,640
Then you better bring a bottle
to bed next time.

668
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,680
-Let's say we eat.
-Blame me, goddamn it...

669
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,280
...it's clear he blames me
for what turns out to be...

670
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,400
.. .to my everlasting surprise,
something missing in his character.

671
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,920
What's missing are a few intimate
parts of my anatomy.

672
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,120
Disgusting.

673
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,880
l do blame myself because
if l hadn't offered them up...

674
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,640
...you'd never have sliced them off.

675
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,920
-l wish l had something to slice you up.
-Get your hand off my tie.

676
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,160
How very stupid.

677
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,000
lt's a scene from one of your books.

678
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,480
That ain't stupid. It's just trash.

679
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:29,200
-Trash?
-Trash.

680
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,440
You said trash?

681
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:33,000
-Trash.
-Successful trash.

682
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:34,160
You're goddamn right.

683
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,760
You put together enough trash,
you get major garbage.

684
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,400
Trash.

685
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,360
Trash, my ass!

686
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,520
Liz.

687
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,960
Doug.

688
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,160
Hi, Doug.

689
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,120
l had the interview.
And it wasn't right.

690
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,480
Really. l'm sorry.

691
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:30,800
lt was probably best.
l'm going down to Houston.

692
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,080
There's a NASA position
that sounds right.

693
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:35,600
That means l'll live in Texas.
Assuming--

694
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,520
-You're serious about this with Merry.
-Yes.

695
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:42,160
l gave her 1 5 years.
You can't say that l wasn't serious.

696
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,200
Aren't you gonna tell her?

697
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,440
We talked it out,
we shouted it out, last night.

698
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:49,040
-No, about Texas.
-Will you tell her?

699
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,440
-ls that why you asked me here?
-No.

700
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,120
No, Doug. Don't start any more
of this fantasy business.

701
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,000
Why don't you let me be your friend?

702
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:57,480
You are my friend.

703
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:00,200
Close friend. You need a close friend.

704
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,160
You and Merry are both
my close friends.

705
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,040
You know what the end
of my fantasy is?

706
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:05,480
-No, Doug.
-Merry divorces me.

707
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,560
-Please.
-You forget about being her friend.

708
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:09,480
-Stop.
-Hey, look at me.

709
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:10,640
And you marry me.

710
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,040
Doug, you're scaring the shit
out of me.

711
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,960
Doug.

712
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,320
-What is it?
-You told her you were meeting me?

713
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,880
Doug.

714
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,600
-l had to.
-Why?

715
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,880
Fifteen years.

716
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:47,000
Don't you want me
to tell her something?

717
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:49,600
Yeah.

718
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:52,000
Tell her goodbye.

719
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,840
Doug.

720
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,960
Doug, wait.

721
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,920
Doug.

722
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:04,320
-Doug.
-He's gone, Merry.

723
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,160
-Gone where?
-He's gone to Texas.

724
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,160
-Texas?
-A job interview in Texas.

725
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,320
Did you tell him l forgive everything
he said?

726
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,640
He doesn't wanna talk,
he's leaving, he's left.

727
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,200
-Left what?
-He's left the marriage.

728
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,560
He said you all talked it out.

729
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,720
Stupid man. He said stupid things.

730
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,400
Well, go get him. Go.

731
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,080
Did he say anything more?

732
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:31,440
He said, goodbye.

733
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,800
Goodbye?

734
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:37,080
-Goodbye.
-That's it?

735
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,440
What--?

736
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,120
What am l gonna do?

737
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:49,520
You're gonna miss him, terribly.

738
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,000
Oh, no, l don't want to.

739
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,040
l hate to be unhappy.

740
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,360
You are making me unhappy
and l'm gonna hate you for it.

741
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,120
l'm gonna hate you, Doug.

742
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,520
l hate you.

743
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,120
-l hate Texas.
-Merry.

744
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Oh, Liz, we were a good marriage.

745
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,240
Everyone said so.

746
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,480
l don't mean just the magazines.
l mean, our friends, everyone.

747
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:30,960
Didn't you think we were happy?

748
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,680
Now what are they going to say?

749
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,440
What can they say?

750
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,000
Just something more that was happy,
gone to waste.

751
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,520
lt's the times.

752
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:45,360
What ugly times we live in.

753
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,680
Another broken home.

754
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,160
l never wanted to be a statistic.

755
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:04,880
Make a new life, isn't that
what abandoned ladies always do?

756
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:06,640
Well, to hell with that.

757
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,480
l'm just gonna keep the same life
with just a piece missing.

758
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,880
l'll just break off a piece.

759
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,800
l got my career.

760
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,440
l got my daughter.

761
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,160
l got you, my friend.

762
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,920
Liz, you'll be my friend, won't you?

763
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:26,680
That's a stupid question.

764
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,920
We'll just be old friends
like always, huh?

765
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,720
Old friends. Of course.

766
00:51:14,681 --> 00:51:16,162
Hello. Sorry.

767
00:51:16,322 --> 00:51:18,362
Liz is late.
Take a little off her vote, huh?

768
00:51:18,521 --> 00:51:21,242
l've forgotten how long it takes
to get around in this city.

769
00:51:21,402 --> 00:51:23,202
How are the ducks and the pigs?

770
00:51:23,362 --> 00:51:25,722
l have a mill pond.
It's for mills, not for ducks.

771
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:29,202
l'd be damned if l'd live in Connectic,,ut
without something that said ''moo.

772
00:51:29,362 --> 00:51:31,522
-Ducks and pigs don't go ''moo.''
-See what l know?

773
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:34,242
lf l can get down to what is called
serious business.

774
00:51:34,402 --> 00:51:36,442
-Where'd they put you up?
-The Algonquin.

775
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:37,722
--which l must read.

776
00:51:37,882 --> 00:51:39,802
Martha, you have every good intention...

777
00:51:39,961 --> 00:51:42,202
...we know, but you're not gonna
read the rules.

778
00:51:42,362 --> 00:51:45,402
-We know the rules.
-lt is not my intention to bore you.

779
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,362
Then don't.

780
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,762
Sorry.

781
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:51,362
We have until December 31st
to make the announcement...

782
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:53,602
...of the best of American fiction
for the year.

783
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:56,282
-All of you, as previous winners--
-She's going to do it.

784
00:51:56,442 --> 00:51:59,162
l have a question. One of the titles
we've been considering...

785
00:51:59,322 --> 00:52:00,962
.. .is Merry Blake's Home Cookin '.

786
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:03,002
lt's already getting
some remarkable press.

787
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,402
That woman has ground out
sausage for 10 years...

788
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:07,002
...and suddenly a book comes out.

789
00:52:07,161 --> 00:52:08,562
That woman is a friend of mine.

790
00:52:08,722 --> 00:52:10,682
lt's not your fault she wrote
something good.

791
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:13,282
-Even old Dr. No likes it.
-Who?

792
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:15,882
Hennings. Didn't you see his piece
in the S_nday rimes?

793
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:17,682
-No, what?
-Enough. Please.

794
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:20,122
He said, ''At last she has written
from the heart...

795
00:52:20,282 --> 00:52:22,882
...and decided to bypass the obstruction
of her brain.''

796
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:24,242
Funny.

797
00:52:26,081 --> 00:52:29,122
l wanna register with you, if you feel
l should disqualify myself.

798
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:31,762
lf anyone should disqualify himself,
it should be me.

799
00:52:31,922 --> 00:52:33,042
What do you mean, Martin?

800
00:52:33,202 --> 00:52:35,362
Well, you know, about me
and Anita Turner.

801
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:37,122
No.

802
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:40,842
Her book is all about me,
for chrissake.

803
00:52:43,322 --> 00:52:44,442
Now, what does that mean?

804
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:45,842
Oh, Martin, be a big boy.

805
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:47,802
You be a big boy.

806
00:52:50,202 --> 00:52:52,362
l just wanted you all to be warned.

807
00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:55,122
My old friend Merry has taken
the floor of a hotel...

808
00:52:55,282 --> 00:52:58,722
...and she intends to lobby this
entire city for this award.

809
00:52:58,882 --> 00:53:01,922
She's got Jules Levi lined up to throw
a series of what she calls...

810
00:53:02,081 --> 00:53:03,362
.. .opinion-forming parties.

811
00:53:03,521 --> 00:53:07,002
Well, we're the only three who can be
impressed by such tactics.

812
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:09,882
That is a cold statement of truth.

813
00:53:10,802 --> 00:53:13,082
When the National Writers' Award
was first formed.. .

814
00:53:13,242 --> 00:53:15,082
...it was the intention of the charter--

815
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,160
1 218, please.

816
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,520
Thanks.

817
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,880
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry.

818
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:44,240
A messenger brought this for you.

819
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,200
The National Writers' Award.

820
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,720
-And this.
-Books, great.

821
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,040
-And there's a man waiting to see you.
-Who?

822
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:52,560
-Mr. Adams.
-Who's that?

823
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:54,320
Christopher Adams.

824
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,720
He's over there, next to the column.

825
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,320
Oh, okay.

826
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,400
Mr. Adams?

827
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:11,720
-No. l'm sorry.
-You're not Christopher Adams?

828
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,840
-No, l'm not.
-l am.

829
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,960
Hi. Chris Adams.

830
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:19,120
Liz Hamilton.

831
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,200
You wanna do it down here
or go to your room?

832
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,920
-Do what?
-You don't remember our appointment?

833
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,000
-No, l don't remember our appointment.
-Well, that's okay.

834
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,200
lt's better than okay, it's terrific.
Nice meeting you.

835
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,680
Would you like a bellboy for these,
Miss Hamilton?

836
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,600
l got them.

837
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,040
Are you a messenger
from the Writers' Award?

838
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:40,200
-l'm from the Stone.
-The what?

839
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,920
Rolling Stone.
We have an interview.

840
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,920
Chris. Chris Adams.
Rolling Stone--

841
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,480
God, l'm sorry.

842
00:54:45,639 --> 00:54:48,840
l'm also sorry l can't possibly do it.
l've gotta read all these. Sorry.

843
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,760
Well, l'll carry them up for you.

844
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:01,720
Come in.

845
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:05,840
-Where do you want this?
-Over here.

846
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,680
l'll just be a minute.

847
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:41,480
Give me room service please.

848
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:43,360
Oh, don't put that on yet.

849
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:45,760
-What do you want to drink?
-l don't drink.

850
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,040
-You don't want a soft drink?
-No.

851
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,840
This is room 1 218.

852
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,880
l'd like a Scotch, please.
And a water to back it up.

853
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:59,880
Oh, no, give me double, thank you.

854
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,720
Somebody left grass around.
Maybe you'd prefer that?

855
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,000
No.

856
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,640
Funny.

857
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,120
When they said someone
from the Stone was coming...

858
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,520
...l imagined a satin jumpsuit...

859
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:20,760
...and two coke spoons coming out
of your nose.

860
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,920
l don't have to use this
at all, if you don't want.

861
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,000
Well, how long is this gonna take?

862
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:27,280
Whatever you want.

863
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,920
You don't wanna talk now, you can
call me later. l'm at the Chelsea.

864
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,040
Since when would l want?

865
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,120
l mean, you guys.

866
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,040
How old are you, may l ask?

867
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:38,760
Twenty-two.

868
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:42,000
Well, you're more like 1 2.

869
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:43,600
lf you say.

870
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,440
l don't really understand
why the interview.

871
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:47,920
Why?

872
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,800
Yeah.

873
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,600
Why me? Why the Stone?
Why me, for the Stone?

874
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,240
-lt was my idea.
-Yeah?

875
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,520
Yeah.

876
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,720
Perhaps you could break
the language barrier.. .

877
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,720
...and let me know
what this is all about.

878
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,720
-There's a language barrier?
-l always thought this was a joke.. .

879
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,520
...you know, about your publication.

880
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:07,480
The utterances of those
who can't speak.. .

881
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:09,480
...written by those who cannot write...

882
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:11,560
-...for those who cannot read.
-l used that.

883
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:12,960
You did?

884
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:15,600
ln one of my interviews.

885
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,160
Well, you see.

886
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,320
After your second novel,
it was my idea to do a piece on you.

887
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,160
There's no one that fits in
right where you do.

888
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,080
The magazine wanted a woman
in the arts.

889
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,040
There were others with more visibility
but l wanted you.

890
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,320
You have political anger.
But reason keeps it cool.

891
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,720
Especially in your small
magazine pieces.

892
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,000
Your fiction, there's passion right there.

893
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:41,320
But again, within the parameters
of taste.

894
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,560
Or maybe it's art, not taste,
you'll tell me.

895
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,720
More than any other woman
with a public profile, l respect you.

896
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,600
Well, turn it on
and maybe we'll get started.

897
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,320
No, it's Scotch.

898
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,600
-Oh, Debby.
-Hi, Aunt Liz.

899
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,280
-Hi.
-Hi.

900
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,640
This is my favorite niece.

901
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,920
More or less my niece,
daughter of a friend.

902
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,560
Her name is Debby.
This is Chris from Rolling Stone.

903
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:16,760
-Hi. Mom didn't call here did she?
-Four times.

904
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,920
What'd she say?

905
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,760
l don't know.
l just got the messages.

906
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,400
l can tell you right now, she's going
to be opposed to my moving in here.

907
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:25,800
She is? Well, so am l.

908
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,720
There's only room here for me,
and the ghost of Dorothy Parker.

909
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,280
l'm not really, l've just gotta
get out of that hotel.

910
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,360
So l can stay at Ginger's.
She hates Ginger.

911
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:34,520
Well, who's she?

912
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:37,840
Ginger Trinidad.
He's this terrific Puerto Rican poet.

913
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,040
You've heard of him.

914
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,360
He started writing poetry in the Tombs,
you know, the New York jail.

915
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,240
-What was he doing there?
-l don't know.

916
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,640
lt was in rlME magazine.

917
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,640
He robbed some liquor stores
or something.

918
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:49,360
But it was politically motivated.

919
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:51,280
Well, apart from a few minor details...

920
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,640
...l don't know what your mother
has against him.

921
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,360
Well, we're making it,
that's what.

922
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:59,160
She's got some weird idea l should save
myself for an astronaut or something.

923
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,040
The Scotch.

924
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,880
Do you ever answer your phone?

925
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:11,840
l have been too busy
answering the door.

926
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,480
-This is Chris Adams.
-How do you do? l see you're here.

927
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:16,520
-He's from the press.
-Oh, how interesting.

928
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:19,440
-Which publication do you write for?
-Rolling Stone.

929
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,760
l've just been trying to find out
one little piece of information...

930
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,280
-...about what went on today?
-You mean about--

931
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,000
-l guess you mean about--
-You know l can't talk about it.

932
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:30,000
-What did they say?
-They liked your book.

933
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:31,160
That much l can say.

934
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,640
-How much?
-Oh, Jesus.

935
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,840
Please, God.

936
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:39,440
Hi, there. Is Debby here?

937
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,720
-You must be Ginger.
-Yeah. You the mother?

938
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,720
She's the mother.
l'm the aunt. Come in.

939
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,880
Thank you.

940
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,040
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Ginger.

941
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:47,200
-How you doing?
-Fine.

942
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,440
-Ready to go?
-Please.

943
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,600
-Good.
-Just one moment.

944
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,840
Please, young lady.

945
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,800
l know, maybe
you don't like me too much.

946
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,040
Not like you?
l have no reason to dislike you.

947
00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:59,440
lt's just a question of my liking
my daughter more.

948
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,120
Perhaps too much, but then again,
she is my daughter.

949
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,320
Maybe you don't like Puerto Ricans.
Is that it?

950
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,640
lt has nothing to do
with being a Puerto Rican.

951
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,960
You could have skin whiter
than apple blossoms.

952
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,000
As long as there's lingering respect...

953
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:13,560
...from my daughter that she'll
consider my opinion...

954
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:17,200
...l would prefer that she not race about
the streets of this dangerous city...

955
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,760
-...with the criminal element.
-Let's go, Ginger.

956
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,360
-Nice meeting you all.
-Ginger.

957
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:23,080
Debby!

958
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,120
You. Darling, Aunt Liz.

959
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,240
After whom my daughter chooses
to model her most formative years.

960
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,480
l've ordered a double, you can have half.
Save your speech until then.

961
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:40,240
You consider it adventuresome,
her affair with a car thief.

962
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,480
-He stole a car?
-He's addicted to the practice.

963
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,040
Maybe he can get me a Mercedes.

964
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:46,200
Debby would roar
over that cynical humor.

965
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,360
Would you get off it?

966
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,600
-l've been keeping this fellow--
-l don't mind.

967
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,000
-l mind.
-l'll go.

968
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:54,640
-l'll go. Just give me one simple word.
-What simple word?

969
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,560
Am l or am l not wasting my time...

970
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,040
.. .and considerable amount
of money back here.. .

971
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:01,520
...or am l going to win
the National Writers' Award?

972
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:03,160
Well, there are two simple words.

973
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,960
Yes and no.

974
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:07,920
-That's all for now?
-That is all for now.

975
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,680
Okay.

976
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,440
Don't forget.

977
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,200
Dinner Friday night at Jules'.

978
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,800
l can't, Merry. l've gotta go up to
Connecticut for at least the weekend...

979
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,080
-...with around 200 books.
-All right.

980
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:22,400
Well, there's another Tuesday night
at my place.

981
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,280
-l'll try.
-Please.

982
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,920
And find someone nice to bring.

983
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,480
Can we do this later?

984
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:44,040
You know what you need?

985
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:45,520
You know what l need?

986
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:47,160
You need to relax.

987
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,320
What do you mean?

988
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,960
Relax? Relax means relax.

989
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,440
You mean, l need someone to relax me?

990
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,120
You think l need someone to relax me?
To come over here and relax me?

991
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,000
l didn't mention someone, no.

992
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:02,960
-Oh, you were gonna do it?
-Do what?

993
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,960
There's an arrogance about men,
sometimes.

994
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,600
Maybe you haven't noticed,
not being yet a man yourself.

995
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,000
-Are you okay?
-Do l sound okay?

996
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,200
Look, all l meant was
you should get some rest.

997
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,920
lf you wanna get some rest
with someone, that's up to you.

998
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:17,560
lf l wanna get movement in bed
l'll check into a motel...

999
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:19,880
...and drop a quarter
in the vibrating mattress.

1000
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:21,880
l'm at the Chelsea
when you wanna do this.

1001
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:25,000
l'm wrong. It is the young men
who are the most arrogant.

1002
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:27,880
When it comes to arrogance
in sexual matters...

1003
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:30,520
.. .they assume everyone
is falling down over them.

1004
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:32,720
Put that on. l have a quote.

1005
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,680
l find this mid-century obsession
with young flesh obscene.

1006
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,320
lt's like eating green cantaloupes.

1007
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:44,720
Okay. Goodbye.

1008
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,320
-ls that for 1 218?
-Yes, ma'am.

1009
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,840
Great.

1010
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,240
Wait.

1011
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:17,200
Thanks. Down, please.

1012
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,960
Excuse me, could you tell me
where Cartier's is?

1013
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:49,520
Yes. It's just up there
on the other side of the street.

1014
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:52,120
Near those flags?

1015
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,680
Yeah.

1016
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:25,680
lt's up there.

1017
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:36,240
This thing doesn't fit.

1018
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,120
lt's supposed to be a bracelet.

1019
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,920
lt'd be fine, if l wanted a necklace.

1020
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:45,760
ls it a gift from your mother?

1021
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,000
No. My mother lives
in Redlands, California.

1022
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:02,840
Are you Mrs. Collins?

1023
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,120
No.

1024
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,200
East 71st Street?

1025
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,760
No.

1026
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,880
At one time, almost every important
literary figure in New York came here.

1027
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:30,120
Over there where you see
the restaurant area...

1028
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,560
...they had a weekly luncheon
called the round table.

1029
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,200
With writers like Robert Benchley,
George Kaufman, Edna Ferber.

1030
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,880
Thank you, Jim, for walking me
all the way down here.

1031
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:55,920
You do a lot of smiling.

1032
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,080
How old are you?

1033
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:50,760
Eighteen.

1034
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,080
Who is Mrs. Collins?

1035
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,760
My problem is,
l'm truly an old-fashioned girl.

1036
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,760
l like men who talk.
l love to talk.

1037
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,160
There's a whole generation
crowding up behind us.. .

1038
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:04,360
...of people who wanna talk
with their bodies.

1039
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,040
Christ, everyone is so muscular
and chic.

1040
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,760
Their tits spilling out all over
the place, soft fashions.

1041
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,480
We've got a generation of beauties.
They're more beautiful than the Greeks.

1042
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,400
But what happened
to the articulate guy?

1043
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,160
l mean, nobody wants to
talk anymore.

1044
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:19,760
You don't have to be hard on me.

1045
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,760
-l'm just listening.
-Listening is an obscenely intimate act.

1046
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:27,000
-lt laughs.
-Well, you said something funny.

1047
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:30,800
l don't talk to everyone. l don't make
Iove to every woman l meet, either.

1048
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,880
Maybe you should catch up
with your peers.

1049
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:37,520
l'll agree with your point. A way to
approach a woman is through the ears.

1050
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,080
Ears, you know.
They're little emblems of sexuality.

1051
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:43,320
l'm listening to you
through little emblems of sexuality.

1052
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:49,800
l'm not ready to concede that the young
aren't more sexually arrogant...

1053
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:52,040
...though, and this is important...

1054
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:54,080
...l have been recently led to believe...

1055
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,680
...that they might have something
to be arrogant about.

1056
01:10:57,479 --> 01:10:59,040
Namely.. .

1057
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:01,840
.. .endurance and bodies.

1058
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:05,400
My old friend Bessie Smith...

1059
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,440
...whose records shared many
an afternoon with me in Paris said...

1060
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:15,040
...she liked it when her daddy
took her for a buggy ride.

1061
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,880
What l like about you is
you never stall.

1062
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:22,680
How about you, kid?

1063
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:25,640
l never preferred it with girls my age.

1064
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,920
l was about to make you,
Christopher Adams...

1065
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:32,720
...the lead character of my new book,
Young Flesh.

1066
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,560
Why not with girls your own age?

1067
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,280
They're always watching
for their own orgasm.

1068
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,520
What should they be watching for?
Your orgasm?

1069
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,720
Our orgasm.

1070
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:55,920
l suppose if l talk fast enough
and stay up all night...

1071
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,440
...l could tell you my life story
before l get on the train in the morning.

1072
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,600
l'll drive you.

1073
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,000
-Connecticut?
-Why not? l got a license.

1074
01:12:03,159 --> 01:12:05,520
Well, for one thing,
l've got to read all those books.

1075
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,200
lf you give me a minute,
l'm sure there's another reason.

1076
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:10,240
Pick you up at 10.

1077
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:12,960
-All right?
-Okay.

1078
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:14,880
Night.

1079
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:16,480
Good night.

1080
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,840
Oh, it's so great.

1081
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
-lsn't it terrific?
-Yeah.

1082
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,880
-l'll get the bags later.
-Okay.

1083
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,960
Here, here, here, l'll help you.

1084
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:53,680
Thanks.

1085
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,640
Watch out, it's slick there.

1086
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,320
Hang on, l'll just get the key.

1087
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,440
Thank you.

1088
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,320
Let me look at you.

1089
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:49,360
Put this on, put this on.

1090
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:57,040
All right, one more.

1091
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,000
-That's enough. That's enough.
-One more.

1092
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,720
l don't like this.

1093
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,400
-Why don't you like this?
-Because l don't like parties.

1094
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,600
-Ginger, you need these people.
-l don't need--

1095
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,800
-Hello, how are you?
-Hi.

1096
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,880
-This is Ginger Trinidad.
-Hi.

1097
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:46,600
-Francis, how are you?
-Francis.

1098
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,560
Hello, hello.

1099
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,520
-How are you?
-Oh, Merry Noel. You're a beauty.

1100
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,200
l won't be for long if Jules doesn't
give me some rest.

1101
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:55,640
lt's party, party, party.

1102
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,280
Excuse me.

1103
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,120
You are late.
But l barely forgive you.

1104
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:06,040
-And your young friend.
-Jules.

1105
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:07,760
Hi, Liz.

1106
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:13,200
My girls.

1107
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,000
This is Christopher Adams.

1108
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,200
-How do you do?
-Fine.

1109
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:21,480
Thank you very much.

1110
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:40,440
Merry.

1111
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,360
l do not believe it.

1112
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,160
lt's true.

1113
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,120
You are in love.

1114
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:10,000
You sly, old land turtle.

1115
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:16,760
He's--

1116
01:17:17,079 --> 01:17:18,800
He's so young.

1117
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,000
God, l'm sick.

1118
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,720
You see, l'll invite just anyone.

1119
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,600
ls this just anyone?

1120
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,440
l could not believe your review.

1121
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,240
l thought Southern boys
were taught nicer manners than that.

1122
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:47,280
l bet your mama won't let you say
at home what you say in print.

1123
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:50,000
Merry Noel,
are you trying to charm me?

1124
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,920
Oh, l'd imagine
that's beyond the realm of possibility.

1125
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,600
Yeats was an absolute madman.

1126
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,360
He and his wife used to sit around
listening for voices...

1127
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,800
...to tell him how to write.

1128
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,840
Once he heard an owl bark,
and it threw him off for days.

1129
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:17,360
Oh, but what he wrote.

1130
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,920
God, the Irish.

1131
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,440
But one man loved
The pilgrim soul in you

1132
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,840
And loved the sorrows
Of your changing face

1133
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:32,440
l've had this great revelation.

1134
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,280
That it's all right.

1135
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:36,560
You know?

1136
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,000
No.

1137
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:39,600
lr.

1138
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,320
lt's all right. Us.

1139
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:42,640
l mean...

1140
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,240
...it's all right for me.

1141
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:46,240
Oh, it's all right to be in love?

1142
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:48,600
Look, l've the right to let me say it.

1143
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,480
That's what l mean...

1144
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,080
...in love.

1145
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,600
To be in love.

1146
01:18:57,359 --> 01:18:59,480
Does sex confuse you?

1147
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,560
No.

1148
01:19:02,359 --> 01:19:06,240
l don't mean how to do it, though that
can be enormously confusing at times.

1149
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:10,000
l just mean the question of sex.

1150
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,840
l went to this therapist one summer.

1151
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,880
He had this insane notion
that's probably true...

1152
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,640
...that l had to wait to be emotionally
mauled by some guy before l can write.

1153
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:25,160
He also said...

1154
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,240
...that l take surrogate lovers.

1155
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:31,640
To wit, l am aroused by object A.

1156
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,720
l go out and go to bed with object B.

1157
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:42,200
With you, l feel like
l'm making love to object A.

1158
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:56,480
Did you ever think that what makes sex
so exciting is that it's so frightening?

1159
01:19:57,079 --> 01:19:59,920
ls that what you think?
Do l frighten you?

1160
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:05,000
lt's like T. S. Eliot. He made this crack
about D. H. Lawrence.

1161
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,720
He said Lawrence
was looking for an intimacy...

1162
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,400
...that was impossible
between a man and a woman.

1163
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:14,400
Well, l say bullshit, T. S. Eliot.

1164
01:20:15,079 --> 01:20:16,560
See, Eliot was just scared.

1165
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:20,960
And there was Lawrence like some
sexual test pilot, ready to take the dive.

1166
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,120
You understand?

1167
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:25,960
Oh, you intellectuals
are too much for me.

1168
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,240
What is everybody afraid of?

1169
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:32,160
Chances? Risk? Commitment?

1170
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:37,200
Those are the popular words but, God,
they don't measure up to the old words.

1171
01:20:37,359 --> 01:20:41,680
Lovesick, heartfelt, with this hand.. .

1172
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,080
...sickness and health, death do us part.

1173
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:47,600
Those are sensational.

1174
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,680
You can't hear them
without ladies weeping.

1175
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:54,440
What do men do?

1176
01:20:55,479 --> 01:20:57,040
Don't they weep?

1177
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:01,560
Well, different style. They've got little
hairs that stand up in a lot of places.

1178
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,920
Are your little hairs standing up?

1179
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,800
Those words, love, honor.

1180
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,960
l'd love to be able to use them,
you know.

1181
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,160
l mean, l'd love to believe in someone,
some one woman so much...

1182
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:16,040
...that l could believe those words...

1183
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:18,320
...and they'd just come jumping
out of my mouth.

1184
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:22,880
What did you mean, some one girl?

1185
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:26,320
-lsn't a woman too old for you?
-God, you're hard.

1186
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:31,000
l'm like T. S., l'm scared.

1187
01:21:31,399 --> 01:21:33,680
l mean, l'd like to say to you
l wanna get married.

1188
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,840
But you'd bitch, you'd laugh.

1189
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,400
No, l wouldn't.

1190
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,400
Who do you wanna marry?

1191
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:49,040
Do you know how many times l've
asked someone to marry me in my life?

1192
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,760
Think about it.

1193
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:27,800
Oh, it's you.

1194
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,360
That fact doesn't thrill me either.

1195
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:34,080
Debby doesn't come in.
She doesn't call. l'm giving up on her.

1196
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:38,000
She's 18, and in this state,
that's old enough for a martini.

1197
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,520
This Brahms you recommended
is crippling my fingers.

1198
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,440
Didn't he write that lullaby,
that Brahms--? ''Brahms' Lullaby''?

1199
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,920
l guess, he must have.
It's got his name on it.

1200
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:14,280
What do you think?

1201
01:23:21,319 --> 01:23:22,400
Perfect.

1202
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,880
No, l mean, the whole picture.

1203
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:28,280
Self-sufficient woman,
a woman of proven talents.. .

1204
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:31,320
...sitting by the fire, playing her piano.

1205
01:23:35,399 --> 01:23:36,560
ls a reporter coming?

1206
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,560
Oh, hardly.

1207
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:40,000
A man.

1208
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,800
A man.

1209
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:45,600
He likes lullabies?

1210
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:47,880
Oh, may l?

1211
01:23:52,119 --> 01:23:54,400
Doug called.
He's in New York.

1212
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:55,920
Doug Blake?

1213
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:59,360
He's tanned and successful,
up from Houston. That's what he says.

1214
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,000
He would've come over,
but it's business, business.

1215
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,400
-When's he coming?
-Tomorrow.

1216
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,720
Give him my love. He's a wonderful man.

1217
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:10,560
He's got something very obvious
in mind. l know it.

1218
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,040
l'm willing to stake my life on it.

1219
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,560
He wants the marriage back.

1220
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,200
lt's only been four years.
That's not long.

1221
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:20,520
They say it takes you five years
for your mattress to lose its imprint.

1222
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,440
We're still imprinted on each other.

1223
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,680
Let me look at you.

1224
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:32,400
-l've lost.
-What?

1225
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,160
That's why you look like
you're standing on your own udder.

1226
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:36,840
Oh, Merry, please.

1227
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,160
They took a vote, l've lost.
And you can't tell me.

1228
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,200
-What is today's date?
-l'm not a child.

1229
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:46,040
Today's date is December 30th.

1230
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:48,600
The final vote is December 31st,
as promised.

1231
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,240
Oh, Liz, l've been dreaming
about my party.

1232
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:59,240
Right at the stroke of midnight,
New Year's.

1233
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:03,520
l announce the victory of my book
and the rejoining of my marriage.

1234
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,000
How can you be so sure?

1235
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:07,080
-Of what?
-Either.

1236
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,680
l'm having tables all along here...

1237
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,800
...just spilling over
with whatever grows this time of year.

1238
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,680
The trouble with December
is there's no strawberries.

1239
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,920
How am l gonna create a big red area
in the center of the table?

1240
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:23,160
Stab one of the guests.

1241
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:29,000
Liz, if all you want is to be unhappy,
l just wish you'd let me be.

1242
01:25:29,159 --> 01:25:31,680
l'm sorry, but those are my thoughts.

1243
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,320
l'm sorry.

1244
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:36,440
l didn't mean to make you unhappy.

1245
01:25:37,079 --> 01:25:39,280
Give my love to Doug.
l meant what l said.

1246
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:41,440
He's a wonderful guy.

1247
01:25:54,119 --> 01:25:57,600
You know, you two are the only thing
l ever admired.

1248
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,440
A marriage...

1249
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,480
...a real child and you loved each other.

1250
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,760
l'm fine, really.

1251
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:11,760
l wanna know
what's going on with you.

1252
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,880
Tomorrow, Merry, tomorrow.

1253
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:25,840
Merry, go back inside.
You'll die out here. l'll call you later.

1254
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,520
Can you lend me your coat for a second?
Just for a second, okay?

1255
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:34,520
-Yes, ma'am. l'll wait inside.
-Okay, thank you.

1256
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,080
Liz.

1257
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:45,200
Liz.

1258
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,520
You are so determined.

1259
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:51,080
lf you're going through all this worry
just because of me and that prize.

1260
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:52,240
No.

1261
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:53,440
Your writing?

1262
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,360
Please, no.

1263
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,120
Rolling Stone?

1264
01:26:57,279 --> 01:26:59,360
His name is Chris Adams.

1265
01:27:01,479 --> 01:27:03,680
That's what it is.

1266
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:09,720
He wants to marry me.

1267
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,160
That boy?

1268
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:13,880
That's what l said.

1269
01:27:14,039 --> 01:27:15,600
He proposed?

1270
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,160
Yes.

1271
01:27:17,319 --> 01:27:19,800
To this mature woman.

1272
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,280
l do not believe that.

1273
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:25,640
That's my problem too.

1274
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,200
Do you think he's serious?

1275
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,320
-He says he is.
-What do you think?

1276
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,040
l said no.

1277
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:37,240
What do you feel?

1278
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,040
l don't want anyone around
watching my thighs grow old.

1279
01:27:42,199 --> 01:27:45,840
You are such a big, bad bear at times,
you only scare yourself.

1280
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,240
Well--

1281
01:27:47,399 --> 01:27:49,920
l mean, how long could it last?

1282
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:51,480
lt's insane.

1283
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,640
-A year.
-You see?

1284
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,000
Or two, maybe three.
From there, there might be a fourth.

1285
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:01,520
What are you saying?

1286
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,560
There's no guarantees.

1287
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,200
lf that man says he wants you...

1288
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:08,160
...you let him stick around
until your thighs turn to stone.

1289
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:10,160
What the shit difference does it make?

1290
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:15,200
Why didn't you say this
in the beginning?

1291
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,560
Well, honey, we're not talking about
a new dress here, this takes a moment.

1292
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,640
1 218, any messages?

1293
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,160
No messages.

1294
01:28:41,319 --> 01:28:43,720
Oh, thanks.

1295
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:46,880
Courthouse? Which courthouse?

1296
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:48,720
ls he on a story?

1297
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:53,200
Yes, please. Tell him l'm at the hotel.
l'm eating in.

1298
01:28:53,399 --> 01:28:55,000
Thank you.

1299
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:03,640
Hello.

1300
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:06,320
Oh, Debby, it's you.

1301
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,680
Look, your mother's looking for you.

1302
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,080
And l'm trying to keep off this line.
l'm expecting a call.

1303
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,840
What? He's with you?

1304
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,680
Yeah, Chris is here. He's been terrific.
He's in talking to the judge now.

1305
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,160
-ls he in trouble?
-No.

1306
01:29:19,319 --> 01:29:20,480
No, not him. It's Ginger.

1307
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,920
They arrested Ginger for parole violation,
carrying a weapon.

1308
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:26,760
lt wasn't even for real.
It was a real gun and everything...

1309
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:29,360
...but he was using it to see
how people would respond.

1310
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,320
He's starting a new novel.

1311
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:32,680
Why didn't you call me?

1312
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,040
l was. l was trying to reach you.
You weren't in.

1313
01:29:36,199 --> 01:29:39,360
So l called the Chelsea and l asked
for Chris, thinking you'd be there.

1314
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,520
No way was l calling my mom
and getting the daughter of Dracula.

1315
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:44,600
Debby, could you please
put Chris on?

1316
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,840
He can't, no. He's in there with Ginger
and the judge.

1317
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:50,600
Okay, sure. As soon as he can.

1318
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,240
Okay.

1319
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,040
Wait.

1320
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:17,240
555-9970, please.

1321
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:22,960
Room 2-1 -8.

1322
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,160
What?

1323
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:30,120
No, this is a friend.

1324
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:33,840
You must.

1325
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,560
They say?

1326
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,200
They said they don't want
to be disturbed?

1327
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,360
Liz. Liz.

1328
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,560
l'm having lunch uptown with Doug.

1329
01:31:03,079 --> 01:31:04,400
Well, l'm going downtown.

1330
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,280
Oh, we'll go downtown.
Go downtown.

1331
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:27,080
Well?

1332
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:31,040
l thought we can have
this conversation later over a drink.

1333
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:32,720
l lost.

1334
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:36,240
-Not exactly.
-l won.

1335
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:39,800
-Not exactly.
-Well, what in God's earth--?

1336
01:31:40,279 --> 01:31:42,160
lt was a dead heat.

1337
01:31:43,239 --> 01:31:46,000
A split prize?

1338
01:31:46,279 --> 01:31:48,240
Well, not really. It was decided that...

1339
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:50,400
...two people should win first prize.

1340
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,000
You...

1341
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:53,840
...and Sharon Gay.

1342
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,800
Sharon?

1343
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:58,640
Both books are in what they call
the American grain.

1344
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,640
-The coming of age of rural America--
-l know the American grain.

1345
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,400
Hers is the black woman's point of view.
Yours, the white.

1346
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,480
Sharon Gay.

1347
01:32:07,239 --> 01:32:09,120
Merry, both are excellent choices.

1348
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:11,920
lf they had the guts,
they'd have given it to the black.

1349
01:32:12,079 --> 01:32:13,200
What is that?

1350
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:15,280
They obviously wanted
to give it to Sharon.

1351
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:17,160
The reviews have been licking her feet.

1352
01:32:17,319 --> 01:32:19,480
You were on the jury,
they had to toss you a bone.

1353
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:22,960
Goddamn it, your book is legitimately
good and so is Sharon's.

1354
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:25,080
l'm a son of a bitch
if l'm gonna explain.

1355
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:26,800
You didn't have to share the award.

1356
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,280
They gave it all to you. Blue Ribbon.

1357
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:32,040
lt may come as a surprise,
but we did not write the same book.

1358
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:33,680
Meaning mine is worse than yours?

1359
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,240
Meaning l am sick and fucking tired...

1360
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:38,760
...of you trying to live your life
through my skin.

1361
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,960
lf l had your skin,
l'd take better care of it.

1362
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:45,960
That is truly amusing.

1363
01:32:46,119 --> 01:32:47,320
Oh, you stop it.

1364
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,840
l'm angry and l want you
to be angry too.

1365
01:32:50,039 --> 01:32:52,560
-l'm getting out of the car.
-l always wanted to write.

1366
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,840
Ever since l was 8 and l started
my first diary.

1367
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,480
lt had nothing to do with you.

1368
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:58,920
Merry, be honest.

1369
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:02,360
lf l had become a glider pilot, you'd be
behind the wheel of a 747 by now.

1370
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,520
Driver, can you drop me here, please?

1371
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,640
Taxi.

1372
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,120
How are you?

1373
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:38,760
Wiped out.

1374
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:40,840
l was worried, this jail business and all.

1375
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,560
l had about three hours' sleep.

1376
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,760
Did you get Ginger out?

1377
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,280
They're holding him for 60 days.
Parole violation.

1378
01:33:46,439 --> 01:33:47,920
Debby must be heartbroken.

1379
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:49,920
-l guess.
-Where is she?

1380
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:51,760
l guess she's still asleep.

1381
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,480
Merry didn't mention she was back.

1382
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,400
-Back where?
-Back at her mother's hotel.

1383
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,560
She's not there.

1384
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,680
-Then where is she sleeping?
-My room.

1385
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,440
Your room.

1386
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,880
On the couch.

1387
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:04,840
-How odd.
-What?

1388
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,120
She could have come to my hotel,
l have a couch.

1389
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:09,680
She was going to her mom's
but you know how that is.

1390
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,760
No. How is that, Chris?

1391
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,320
-Are you upset?
-l'm upset for Debby.

1392
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:16,200
All alone and no place to go.

1393
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:19,200
Chelsea must be booked up
or she wouldn't impose on you.

1394
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:21,520
-You know Chelsea's not booked.
-How do l know?

1395
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:25,160
-l haven't checked the books in days.
-Christ, l didn't wanna tell you this.

1396
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:27,720
Tell me about what?
Something l shouldn't know?

1397
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,560
No, l knew you'd get carried away.

1398
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:32,840
Never been calmer.
It's you who's gone all emotional.

1399
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,800
Sudden compassion
for runaway teenagers.

1400
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,320
-Or do you consider them as peers?
-Stop it, please.

1401
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:39,960
Why couldn't you receive calls?
What was all that about?

1402
01:34:40,119 --> 01:34:43,240
Debby and her mom were having
fights and she kept calling back.

1403
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,000
What if it had been me?

1404
01:34:45,159 --> 01:34:46,880
Why am l on the defensive?

1405
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:49,680
l'm trying to say that...

1406
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:54,240
...l've been sleepless all night,
reconsidering your proposals.

1407
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:55,920
You remember, your many proposals.

1408
01:34:56,079 --> 01:34:58,400
-Your many insistent proposals--
-Stop!

1409
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:01,640
You said no. We don't have
to beat it to death.

1410
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,200
-l'm sorry.
-All l said was l wanted to marry you.

1411
01:35:06,359 --> 01:35:08,840
You didn't have to be
so goddamn hostile.

1412
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:12,840
Well, then, be man enough
to end the hostilities.

1413
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,120
Hostilities end when one side
surrenders.

1414
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:17,400
ls that what you think marriage is?
A surrender?

1415
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,840
Who the fuck is talking about marriage?

1416
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:23,280
You were. Until you opened
a youth hostel.

1417
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,840
Can l join you guys?

1418
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:31,840
l guess not, huh?

1419
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,440
-l'm sorry, hon, it's not really--
-No, no. No problem.

1420
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,400
l better go call Mom
and tell her what's going on, anyway.

1421
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,600
l'll call you later.
And thank you, really...

1422
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,160
...for saving my life.

1423
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,800
Bye, Aunt Liz.

1424
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,480
Bye, baby.

1425
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,120
l'm going on the road
with Fleetwood Mac.

1426
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:53,000
l'm doing an interview.

1427
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,720
Debby's going with me as my assistant.

1428
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,840
lt was in the budget
and the guy l was--

1429
01:36:04,279 --> 01:36:08,760
Debby's been wanting to get away
from home. l think that's good.

1430
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,920
-Yeah.
-Truly.

1431
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,640
lt's better than good. It's fantastic.

1432
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,200
Yeah?

1433
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,120
-Do me a favor?
-What?

1434
01:36:18,279 --> 01:36:19,960
Don't say we're gonna be friends.

1435
01:36:20,119 --> 01:36:23,320
We're inappropriate as friends.

1436
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,640
-lf l can't have you as a lover, l--
-What makes you so sure?

1437
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,040
Well, we have to agree
about one thing.

1438
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:33,520
That in some ways
l'm more mature than you.

1439
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,560
l've seen some endings.

1440
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,880
This is one.

1441
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:39,600
l wanted something from you.

1442
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,880
l know.

1443
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:44,440
-You made me really furious.
-l know.

1444
01:36:46,279 --> 01:36:48,080
Do me another favor.

1445
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:50,080
Let's forget about the interview.

1446
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:52,160
l don't wanna read it.

1447
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:56,080
We've written something
sensational together.

1448
01:36:57,039 --> 01:36:59,400
But it's a private edition.
Let's not make it public.

1449
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,040
You talk some good talk, you know.

1450
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:05,440
Like my old friend Yeats said:

1451
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:09,240
When you're old and gray
And nodding by the fire

1452
01:37:09,399 --> 01:37:11,920
You can take down that book
And slowly read

1453
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:54,360
Are you leaving?

1454
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,840
l'm going to Connecticut.

1455
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,920
What about my party?

1456
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:01,080
l'm sorry. l was gonna call.

1457
01:38:01,239 --> 01:38:04,480
l'm so down, l'd just spoil it.

1458
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:08,680
l think we have come
to a serious juncture in our lives...

1459
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,200
...when we should examine
the terms of our friendship.

1460
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:12,840
Hold this.

1461
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:15,600
Thanks.

1462
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,400
Merry, l'm truly sorry about the award...

1463
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,200
...but it's not the worst thing that could
happen. There'll be lots of publicity.

1464
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:26,120
That is water long under the bridge.

1465
01:38:26,279 --> 01:38:28,760
-How was Doug?
-Even longer under the bridge.

1466
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,520
-ls he still drinking?
-Dry as the Sahara.

1467
01:38:32,119 --> 01:38:33,800
How does he look?

1468
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,360
He's getting married.

1469
01:38:41,239 --> 01:38:43,480
-Not to--?
-Joyce.

1470
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:45,480
From Houston.

1471
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:47,320
Poor Merry.

1472
01:38:47,479 --> 01:38:49,920
What a day you are having.

1473
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:53,440
They've bought a house
with a yard.

1474
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,320
-Sounds wonderful to me.
-Oh, since when?

1475
01:38:56,479 --> 01:38:59,240
l'm not immune to the attractions
of a man and a yard.

1476
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:01,160
Or to Doug specifically?
Doug and a yard?

1477
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:02,320
l never thought of it.

1478
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:04,720
-Never thought of Doug as a husband?
-Never.

1479
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:08,160
Along with his ability to drink,
he has lost his ability to lie.

1480
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:11,000
-Don't you look away from me.
-l'm closing my suitcase.

1481
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:13,760
l began to smell there was something
he didn't wanna say.

1482
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,080
l bought him a drink
and it all came tumbling out.

1483
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:17,360
You bought him a drink?

1484
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,280
What a petty, disgusting confession
it was.

1485
01:39:20,439 --> 01:39:22,840
Me, the unsuspecting wife...

1486
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,560
...blaming myself over the years
as l sensed my husband...

1487
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,680
...slowly but surely
slipping away from me.

1488
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:29,720
Those don't sound like Doug's words.

1489
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,320
lsn't it true that all the time
he was married to me...

1490
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:34,240
...he was pouring out his love for you?

1491
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:36,200
-He mentioned it.
-While married to me?

1492
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:39,120
-At the last.
-And he proposed?

1493
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:40,880
Merry, l said no.

1494
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:43,440
Oh, because of your friendship
with me?

1495
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,000
At least you got that right.

1496
01:39:45,159 --> 01:39:48,960
Except for that strange lapse into
morality you would have taken him?

1497
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,160
He sure deserved better
than he was getting.

1498
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,800
How did you know what he was getting?
Did he describe it?

1499
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,760
lf you have any more revelations,
keep them for your diaries...

1500
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,760
...or your novels,
they sound about alike.

1501
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,520
Well, it's happy time for all.

1502
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,920
Doug and his Joyce.
You and your cradle snatchings.

1503
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:06,480
You can have a double ceremony.

1504
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,280
lf you mean Chris, he's gone.

1505
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:12,840
Where?

1506
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:17,120
lnto the arms of what you would be
corny enough to call...

1507
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:19,640
-...''the other woman.
-Who?

1508
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:21,920
Debby.

1509
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:25,920
My Debby?

1510
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:28,080
That's absurd.

1511
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:31,120
That's what l thought.
They're too close in age.

1512
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:32,560
l'm gonna put a stop to that.

1513
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:34,000
Hell you are.

1514
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:36,120
Chris is giving her a job with
my blessings.

1515
01:40:36,279 --> 01:40:38,640
Doesn't that just complete the picture?

1516
01:40:39,479 --> 01:40:40,640
ln a painful kind of way.

1517
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,280
Everything l've ever had,
l had to share because of you.

1518
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:45,440
My award, my husband, my daughter.

1519
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,760
lsn't there anything that's mine?

1520
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,320
-Your bile.
-My righteous anger.

1521
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:51,960
What a preacher you would make.

1522
01:40:52,119 --> 01:40:54,520
Because l don't have the morals
of a yellow dog?

1523
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:56,800
l have respect for the morals
of yellow dogs.

1524
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,520
-One come in the yard, we'd kick it.
-They're loyal.

1525
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:01,520
They'd hump a snake if it stood still.

1526
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:03,680
-l haven't tried snakes.
-A miracle.

1527
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,560
-Now, l'm a slut?
-You said it.

1528
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:08,200
What are you saying, Merry?

1529
01:41:08,359 --> 01:41:10,160
How many men have you had?

1530
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:11,560
-ls that the test?
-How many?

1531
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,320
-How many before you're a slut?
-Three.

1532
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:17,120
-Kick me out of the yard.
-How many besides my husband?

1533
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:19,760
Three sailors and a jockey
but never your husband.

1534
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,240
Which at this point, l regret.

1535
01:41:21,399 --> 01:41:25,040
What astonishes me is that you have no
idea why l truly hate you at this point.

1536
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:27,240
lt's not because of your jealousy
over my work.

1537
01:41:27,399 --> 01:41:28,400
Oh, your work!

1538
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,280
Because you lack the moral sensibility
to appreciate what l have lost in Doug.

1539
01:41:32,439 --> 01:41:33,880
-Next to nothing.
-Liar.

1540
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:35,880
A possession.
You lost more in that bear.

1541
01:41:36,039 --> 01:41:37,840
That is one thing of mine
you won't keep.

1542
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,160
Take him. That's one thing
that won't talk back...

1543
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:42,440
...so you can turn to hate
of all exaggerations.

1544
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,480
-l am not such a woman.
-You're right.

1545
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,400
-You are part such a woman.
-Meaning?

1546
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:47,560
Cunt.

1547
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,160
God!

1548
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,640
-Give me that bear. Give it.
-lt's mine.

1549
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,520
Give me that. Give it here.

1550
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,560
Darling, l've been looking for you.

1551
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:47,800
-Happy New Year, Jules.
-Happy New Year, angel.

1552
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:51,480
Where are you going, love?

1553
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:53,240
A party.

1554
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:20,840
Liz.

1555
01:44:26,199 --> 01:44:28,360
Hello? Liz?

1556
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,200
Liz.

1557
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:39,960
Hello?

1558
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,200
Come in.

1559
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:55,280
Do you know how much it costs
to take a cab here from New York?

1560
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:56,880
Ninety dollars.

1561
01:44:57,039 --> 01:44:58,280
Ninety.

1562
01:44:58,439 --> 01:45:00,880
l tipped him five. Was that enough?

1563
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,560
Oh, boy, doesn't that feel good.

1564
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,000
Do you have glasses?

1565
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,360
l hated my party.

1566
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,760
Damn, the bubbles are gone.

1567
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,080
Thanks.

1568
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:52,920
l'm not much good at apologizing.

1569
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,880
l guess l never have, actually,
but l am now.

1570
01:45:57,159 --> 01:45:59,840
-You don't have to.
-l certainly do.

1571
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:02,120
l couldn't hate you.

1572
01:46:02,279 --> 01:46:04,880
And even if sometimes l do,
l shouldn't say it.

1573
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:07,760
You're my oldest friend.
What else have we got in life?

1574
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:09,840
Our oldest enemies.

1575
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:13,480
Honey, as the years go on,
they begin to look alike.

1576
01:46:17,239 --> 01:46:18,760
l've been thinking about us.

1577
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:20,400
Really?

1578
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,480
We're terrific.

1579
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,640
You don't say.

1580
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:29,720
We've accomplished one hell of a lot,
in one lifetime.

1581
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,960
What we deserve is a rest.

1582
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,080
And we shouldn't always argue.

1583
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,200
l know. You're right.

1584
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:43,800
-You know what we should do?
-What?

1585
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,280
Take a year off...

1586
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:49,040
...and sail around the Greek Isles.

1587
01:46:51,319 --> 01:46:55,160
Only sleep with guys
who can't pronounce our names.

1588
01:46:55,319 --> 01:46:56,560
All Greeks.

1589
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:01,520
Well, l couldn't do that.

1590
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,320
Just the fishermen.

1591
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:07,120
But how could l do such a thing?

1592
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:12,200
lt's simple. You just go there
and let it happen.

1593
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:17,160
l wouldn't even know where to start.
l wouldn't-- What would l say?

1594
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:20,880
All my life l've wanted men...

1595
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:24,120
.. .to find something mysterious
and seductive in my work.

1596
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,560
Some poetry.

1597
01:47:28,119 --> 01:47:29,120
Me too.

1598
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:35,520
Now, let them find the poetry
in my body.

1599
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,360
Forget about the books.

1600
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:49,960
Merry.. .

1601
01:47:50,119 --> 01:47:51,120
...do me a favor.

1602
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:53,400
What?

1603
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,040
Kiss me.

1604
01:48:01,359 --> 01:48:02,400
After all these years...

1605
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,680
...are you going to tell me that
there's something strange about you?

1606
01:48:08,439 --> 01:48:10,400
lt's New Year's Eve.

1607
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:14,240
l want the press of human flesh...

1608
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:16,880
...and you're the only flesh around.

1609
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:18,520
Kiss me.

1610
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:49,640
