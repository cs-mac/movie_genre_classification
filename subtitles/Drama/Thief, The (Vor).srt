1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,160
Whom did...

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,659
Joong Tae kill?

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,830
It was 25 years ago.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,260
In your villa,

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,530
he killed my biological father.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,840
That's right.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,610
I'm Kim Soo Hyun.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,440
Do you know how I feel now?

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,409
Just like Yoon Joong Tae tried to kill you,

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,350
I want to take care of you now.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,820
Please.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,850
Please don't kill me.

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,890
You kidnapped three people.

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,020
You kidnapped my biological father,

15
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,830
my father who raised me,

16
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,600
and Great Aunt who made me who I am now.

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,260
And you still want me to save your life?

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,700
Mr. Choi.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,400
Go meet with him.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,640
If Joong Tae killed your biological father,

21
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,340
he will be of help.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,420
You still believe Choi Tae
Seok is on your side.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,820
Think how your map reached
Yoon Joong Tae's hands.

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,120
Was it...

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,160
Tae Seok?

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,360
Correct.

27
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,530
They're on the same side.

28
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,340
I guess you've already
met with Choi Tae Seok.

29
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,370
That means Joong Tae knows
that you're all right.

30
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,140
He'll try to murder you again then.

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,280
All I need is to sit back and
wait to get both of you.

32
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,220
You'll be killed by your son-in-law,

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,120
and I'll arrest him for murder.

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,950
How efficient.

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,120
Please...

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,230
Please save my life.

37
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,130
(Episode 32)

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,240
I have a question.

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,840
It was you who kidnapped
my biological father.

40
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,410
Then why did Yoon Joong Tae kill him?

41
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,380
Why did he kill him when you took the map?

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,380
I have no idea.

43
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,190
I don't know why,

44
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,460
but Joong Tae...

45
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,860
got in my way...

46
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,600
when I was looking for the map.

47
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,300
I think Joong Tae's grandfather was...

48
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,946
the one who betrayed the Heroic Corps.

49
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,140
He betrayed them?

50
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,540
Some of the lost treasure...

51
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,110
was found in his house.

52
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,080
Please help me.

53
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,720
Joong Tae is our mutual enemy.

54
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,929
I can trust neither the police...

55
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,790
nor the prosecution.

56
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,760
As you said,

57
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,199
if Joong Tae finds out that I'm conscious,

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
he'll come to kill me.

59
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,100
I will do...

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,910
everything you say.

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,910
Please help me.

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,330
Dad.

63
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,000
Why are you out here?

64
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
They're replacing his urine bag.

65
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,700
What about you?

66
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,010
Well...

67
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,050
I came to see your grandfather
when people aren't around him.

68
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,780
They all don't want me to be here.

69
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,910
By the way, his condition
is a little weird.

70
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,920
He regained his consciousness
the other day.

71
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,650
He said something to me.

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
What did he say?

73
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,990
The doctor said his mind can come and go.

74
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,860
Why are you telling me this now?

75
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,670
Mom told me not to tell you.

76
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,660
Did something happen between
you and Grandfather?

77
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,310
Wait.

78
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,150
Why are you wearing a mask?

79
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,120
Take it off.

80
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,050
This is for hygiene.
Anything wrong with it?

81
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,520
Nothing. You can leave.

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,260
Dad, what happened?

83
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,970
I'm very sensitive about his safety.

84
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,170
Father, how are you feeling?

85
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,710
Hwa Young told me that
you are able to speak.

86
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,026
Please say something.

87
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,180
Grandfather.

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,190
You recovered your senses the other day.

89
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,720
Do you recognize me?

90
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,060
I don't.

91
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,300
Who are you?

92
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,180
Thank you.

93
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:34,780
That's okay.

94
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,220
You paid my kid's medical bill before.
You don't have to do this.

95
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,026
Still, it could be dangerous.

96
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,396
I know you wouldn't do anything bad.

97
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,530
Please let me know if you need me again.

98
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,810
You don't answer my phone calls.
Where are you?

99
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,640
This is the file you asked me.

100
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,000
I think...

101
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,740
Joong Tae's grandfather was...

102
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,179
the one who betrayed the Heroic Corps.

103
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,140
Before she died,

104
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,720
she said Yoon Jae Hong is a traitor.

105
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,579
She also left the word "betrayal"...

106
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,019
in that secret room.

107
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,020
"Betrayal"?

108
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,119
- Maybe a traitor.
- Shut it.

109
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,420
There was a traitor?

110
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,830
I think Joong Tae's grandfather was...

111
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,830
the one who betrayed the Heroic Corps.

112
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,929
The one who concealed his identity
to protect his children...

113
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,669
said this before he died.

114
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,740
There was...

115
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,670
a traitor within them,

116
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,286
and he buried the evidence
that proves his betrayal...

117
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,040
with the treasure.

118
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,120
I think I know why you want
the map so desperately.

119
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,790
You're not interested in the treasure.
You just don't...

120
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,589
want the truth about your
grandfather to be exposed.

121
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,390
- Shut it.
- Did you think...

122
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,230
you could hide it forever?

123
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,859
All the historical truth
are revealed in the end.

124
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,200
You made a mistake.

125
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,200
Since you kidnapped my kid,

126
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,500
I'll find out who you
really are by any means.

127
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,340
I told you to shut it.

128
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,470
You're here.

129
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,070
Sit down.

130
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,810
- Let me fill your glass.
- Thank you.

131
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,990
Did something happen?

132
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,220
I have a favor to ask you.

133
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,730
I am worried about Chairman Hong's will...

134
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,460
which will be revealed after his death.

135
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,229
I'm sure most of his property...

136
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,140
will be inherited to Mi Ae and Yoon Ho.

137
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,569
We can't let such people
run a major company.

138
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,340
It's also a national tragedy.

139
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,810
In regard to that,

140
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,879
I'm investigating the owners of
Yoon Ho's borrowed-name accounts.

141
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,550
That's not enough.

142
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,720
If the old man's shares go to Mi Ae,

143
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,720
from that point on,

144
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,520
the game won't be fair anymore.

145
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,760
Then what do you want me to do?

146
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,070
The documents about Chairman Hong's
attorney and witness for his will.

147
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,510
I'm telling you I want to
change Chairman Hong's will.

148
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,450
Chief Prosecutor.

149
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,256
But that's a felony.

150
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,120
His life has been a series of felonies.

151
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,890
It's a bigger crime...

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,489
if those with silver spoons in
their mouth who are incompetent...

153
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,630
inherit the company.

154
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,600
I want to turn Cheonmun Group
into a social enterprise.

155
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,346
I want to remove the rich
from running the company.

156
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,640
After I make an environment
where everyone is pleased with,

157
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,970
I plan to leave my post without
any lingering feeling.

158
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,140
Why?

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,720
Because my dream lies somewhere else.

160
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,580
Joon Hee,

161
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,550
I want to trust you.

162
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,620
You've already set your foot in the mud.

163
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,260
We ought to stay together.

164
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,070
We ought to make the lotus bloom together.

165
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,886
Where have you been?

166
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,350
You said you wanted to go on a date.

167
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,980
I'm sorry. I forgot.

168
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,166
I was waiting at your office
and left the files there.

169
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,220
I know. I saw.

170
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,890
- Did you wait long?
- Yes.

171
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,960
Did I scare you just then?

172
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,000
I was just kidding.

173
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,030
But why? What is it?

174
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,040
The truth is...

175
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,170
I retrieved my last memory.

176
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,546
When the three maps are put together,

177
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,050
I can find the national treasures
the Heroic Corps had stolen,

178
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,320
but something more important
is with the treasures.

179
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,980
What is that?

180
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,550
The evidence that Yoon Jae Hong
betrayed the Heroic Corps.

181
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,090
To hide that evidence,

182
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,820
Yoon Joong Tae killed my biological dad.

183
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,420
You mean Chief Prosecutor Yoon Joong Tae?

184
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,360
Yes. I clearly remember...

185
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,500
the last moment of my dad.

186
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,330
Then...

187
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,446
is it possible my dad...

188
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,700
It's either Yoon Joong Tae...

189
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,840
or his henchman.

190
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,810
Sir.

191
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,490
Sir.

192
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,660
What were you talking about the other day?

193
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,389
Did Chief Prosecutor Yoon really try to...

194
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,760
How dare you!

195
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
Are you here to kill me?

196
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,930
Did Yoon Joong Tae put you up to this?

197
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,800
- Sir.
- You little...

198
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,300
How dare you plot with him...

199
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,070
and steal the maps from me?

200
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,610
You scumbag. Do you think
I'll let you off easy?

201
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Calm down. That's not true.

202
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,749
I didn't know Chief Prosecutor
Yoon stole the maps from you.

203
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,350
Stop lying, you piece of trash.

204
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,380
You were the one...

205
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,390
who stole the maps from
me in the first place.

206
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,160
I trusted you.

207
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,530
Wait until I'm completely recovered.

208
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,900
I'm going to finish you first.

209
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,460
You little...

210
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,970
Grandfather. What is wrong?

211
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,710
Who are you?

212
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,610
What are you doing here?

213
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,040
I'm Mr. Choi.

214
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,450
I used to work for him back in the days.

215
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,550
I take that he hasn't recovered yet.

216
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,760
Grandfather. Do you really know him?

217
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
You're home.

218
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,680
I was worried that you wouldn't come home.

219
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,320
Let's spend some time together.
Just the two of us.

220
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,620
Please?

221
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,150
Let's go in.

222
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,150
How does it look? Doesn't it look nice?

223
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,870
Here you go.

224
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,410
Honey, I'm sorry that I doubted you.

225
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,940
Because of Dad,

226
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,280
I must have had a lot on my mind.

227
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,050
Do you still...

228
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,060
believe that I tried to kill your dad?

229
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,130
It's a known fact that Dad is not himself.

230
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,430
But if something like that happens,

231
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,930
it'd be weird if I weren't flustered.

232
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,470
Or it could mean that you
didn't trust me enough.

233
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,940
From what you did to me,

234
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,940
you just proved yourself how
lowly you thought of me.

235
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,720
You know how much I love you.

236
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:33,690
I...

237
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,360
married you when I was 24 years old.

238
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,460
It's been 30 years already.

239
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,830
It means the time I spent with you...

240
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,200
is longer than the time
I spent with my dad.

241
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,870
Let's not...

242
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,900
think about Dad anymore.

243
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,410
We should live our own life. Please?

244
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,810
I should buy another bracelet.

245
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,010
It doesn't look good on you.

246
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,766
What are you talking about?

247
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,260
He's gone missing after he fell
into gambling debts in Macao?

248
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,460
Find him even if the thugs
were involved in this.

249
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,170
Right now, he's the only hope I have.

250
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,510
Soo Hyun must be alive.

251
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,410
If I can find him, then
I can find my son too.

252
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,420
I can't give up this time.

253
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,590
Never. I won't ever give up this time.

254
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,790
How are you going to find the map?

255
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,540
If this is about a revenge
for your biological dad,

256
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,570
the only way is to take down Yoon
Joong Tae after finding the map.

257
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,970
That's what he's dreading the most now.

258
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,310
Dol Mok.

259
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,270
When I found out Mr.
Jang and Master Kwon...

260
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,180
broke into Chairman Hong's secret office,

261
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,750
I was really shocked.

262
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,920
Anyway, you can't take that approach.

263
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,230
I'm sure we can find a legal
way to deal with this.

264
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,860
Let's find that way together.

265
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,100
Okay.

266
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,160
You must be tired. You
have to work tomorrow.

267
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,900
- Let's go in and rest.
- Okay.

268
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,210
Tell me if you want to cry...

269
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,380
or if you're hurting.

270
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,891
I can't imagine how shocked
you must be for witnessing...

271
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,590
your dad getting murdered.

272
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,290
When you thought about that again,

273
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm sure it got harder for you.

274
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,070
I'm right behind you.

275
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,040
Don't turn your back on me
pretending you're okay.

276
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,540
Okay?

277
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,950
I heard no one can be
completely free of crimes.

278
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,771
I mean, you are the corporate
lawyers for Cheonmun Group.

279
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,020
It'd be odd if you were so innocent.

280
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,760
What is it that you want?

281
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,430
I need you to revise the will.

282
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,410
I want the primary inheritor...

283
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,440
to be Chief Prosecutor Yoon.

284
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,210
That's not revising. That's fabricating.

285
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,510
You are an officer of the law.

286
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Did Chief Prosecutor Yoon
instruct you to do this?

287
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,450
Attorney Kim, let's go.

288
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,520
Your son in the US.

289
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,000
What do you plan to do with him?

290
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,520
Drugging and raping a
girl isn't a small crime.

291
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,060
Since you covered it up, it
will be a bigger problem.

292
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,630
If the chairman finds out that we
fabricated his will, we are done.

293
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,670
Don't worry.

294
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,870
Isn't he suffering from dementia?

295
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,050
Hong Il Gwon's era is a bygone era now.

296
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,780
Join the new wave.

297
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,366
- It's so hot.
- I'm sweating so much.

298
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,490
This way.

299
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,129
- It's so hot.
- Oh, hello.

300
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,970
Good morning everyone.

301
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,300
What are you doing here?

302
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,299
What are you doing in my house
from early in the morning?

303
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,446
He's renting the annex from today.

304
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,680
Isn't it already so crowded with us?

305
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:25,080
The house feels lonely, and it costs a lot.

306
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,109
Should I charge you more?

307
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,049
It's good to have more people.

308
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,690
No house is better than a crowded house.

309
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,889
The problem is that he stinks.

310
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,359
Jong Beom likes to save water.

311
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,790
That's even better.

312
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,000
Shower won't change him.

313
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,199
I'm a bit disappointed.

314
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,569
You were against us moving in here.

315
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,739
Right.

316
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,939
She tried to kick me out.

317
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,809
When did I do that?

318
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,609
Then let's vote to be fair.

319
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,709
Hold on.

320
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,250
Before we vote, I'll have a pre-activity.

321
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,679
Take this first.

322
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,019
- What is this?
- What is it?

323
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,720
- Take one.
- Here, Yeo Wool.

324
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,296
If you accept me,

325
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,429
I promise you...

326
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,099
to give one free chicken every month.

327
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,499
- I agree.
- I agree.

328
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,929
Then I agree.

329
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,800
You're all capitalists.

330
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,719
It's not even spring, but
the spring breeze...

331
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,850
is making me sad.

332
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,890
You must be happy.

333
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,259
They must be.

334
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,160
They're just happy to see each other.

335
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,370
Well...

336
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,809
I think there's a misunderstanding.

337
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,656
We didn't do anything.

338
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,309
What do you mean nothing? I
saw it with my own eyes.

339
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,780
We're all old enough. You
don't need to hide it.

340
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,420
I said no. What's wrong with you all?

341
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,890
Gosh.

342
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,289
Hey, Mr. Oh. I'll kick you out...

343
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,030
if you don't stop.

344
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,529
My goodness.

345
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,060
There's nothing wrong with being in love.

346
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,399
There's no need to be upset.
They scared me.

347
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,000
Why would you get upset?

348
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,210
Mom. Can't you see it?

349
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,340
They're flirting.

350
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,150
What? Really?

351
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,550
What is it? What's going on?

352
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,466
Stop it.

353
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,620
Master Kwon and Mr. Jang
look great together.

354
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,320
- You think so?
- Yes.

355
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,666
What do you mean?

356
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,676
You were tricked by a handsome man before.

357
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,130
You should know better by now.

358
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,529
Mr. Jang is tall,

359
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,300
but he's not handsome.

360
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,086
But when I look at Uncle Dol Mok,

361
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,180
he must've been handsome when he was young.

362
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,009
Tell me about it, Yeo Wool.

363
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,979
- Mom.
- Hey, stop it now.

364
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,849
It's up to her. You're
going over the limit.

365
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,580
What's wrong with you?

366
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,420
It's a misunderstanding.
I've never said I like him.

367
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,159
- No way.
- Don't try to hide it.

368
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,360
I'm against it.

369
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,729
You're so tender hearted
that it's obvious...

370
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,130
- you'll pour your heart out.
- Hey...

371
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,300
You'll end up getting hurt.

372
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,639
I'll never accept it...

373
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,899
until Mr. Jang begs me.

374
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,970
Do you get it?

375
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,040
Hey.

376
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Hey.

377
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,110
You have a great daughter, Master Kwon.

378
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,579
Do you want me to work on her, Master?

379
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,390
I told you there's nothing.

380
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,960
My gosh.

381
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,530
- Just say it.
- Stop it.

382
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,659
I didn't know Dad was such a ladies' man.

383
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,099
When did you make Master
fall in love with you?

384
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,669
You never know...

385
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,176
if he only caught her heart
or what comes after.

386
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,669
What are you talking about?
It was only an accident.

387
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,340
Father. You know I respected
you for a long time, right?

388
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,680
I'd appreciate if you could tell
me how to cause that accident.

389
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,750
- Gosh. You asked for it.
- That hurts.

390
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,249
Master Kwon was only giving me...

391
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,919
an acupuncture treatment.

392
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,826
He misunderstood it.

393
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,659
Dad. As you know,

394
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,836
Master never do anything for free.

395
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,929
She only cares about her profit.

396
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,059
She's seriously not my type.

397
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,029
Listen to what he's saying.

398
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,099
Don't be so picky. You're old now.

399
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,870
You just blend in.

400
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,899
I think you two are meant to be.

401
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,370
- That's what I mean.
- Dol Mok.

402
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,109
I'm really scared of Master Kwon.

403
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,516
She even protects you at night.
There's nothing to be scared of.

404
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,080
- That's right.
- Be quiet. Leave.

405
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,509
- Out. Go out.
- What's wrong with you?

406
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,779
- Father...
- Out.

407
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,380
- Try kissing her.
- I said out.

408
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,550
Our medical appliances...

409
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,360
will take care of your health...

410
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,990
in this 21st-century aging society.

411
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,729
I'll never forget to develop
a new technology...

412
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,700
for the aging society, and
be the leader who puts...

413
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,650
the customer service before anything else.

414
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,000
(Jamun Medical Appliances Conference)

415
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,240
Come here.

416
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,580
What do you think?

417
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,619
This is too much for me.

418
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,049
I doubted you and slapped you.

419
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,790
I feel so ashamed.

420
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
Come here.

421
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,060
Have a seat.

422
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,030
Take this as my apology.

423
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,959
Okay.

424
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,600
Great. Then sign here.

425
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,200
I'm buying this for you.

426
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,740
So many people want to open a store,

427
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,880
but I'm letting you open up the first one.

428
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,280
Mom. It's an emergency.

429
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,080
Aunt Mi Ae just notified she'll
have a major shareholders' meeting.

430
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,780
What?

431
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,230
You look so powerful, Mom.

432
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,960
Finally,

433
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,370
everything is in its place.

434
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,869
I'm the direct lineage of my mom.

435
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,110
Are you really going to
take over the whole thing?

436
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,540
Yoon Ho.

437
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,040
Listen.

438
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,650
This one hunter...

439
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,679
captured an eagle and kept it in a cage...

440
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,320
with a chicken and a duck
feeding chicken feed.

441
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,790
But five years later, the eagle...

442
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,129
didn’t fly with its 3m wings.

443
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,190
You know why?

444
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,330
Because it doesn't...

445
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,400
need to hunt.

446
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,430
You're so smart, Yoon Ho.

447
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,040
The eagle was satisfied
with the chicken feed...

448
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,310
that it refused to fly.

449
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,309
It has the spirit of chicken...

450
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,020
instead of the eagle's.

451
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,719
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

452
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,359
I won't let you eat chicken feed anymore.

453
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,460
So you better...

454
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,160
stop showing interest in chicken feed.
Get it?

455
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,900
Sure.

456
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,070
Do you have a borrowed-name account for...

457
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,200
Vice-President Lee Yoon Ho?

458
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

459
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,816
I have all the data.

460
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,709
This Singapore account is in your name.

461
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,809
Were you aware when you received
this vitamin drink box?

462
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,780
Taking Hong Mi Ae's money
isn't just a simple bribery.

463
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,850
What did she ask you in return?

464
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,089
I'm sorry, but how would I
know when Chairwoman Hong...

465
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,920
gave it to me first?

466
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,959
If you continue to do this, I'll
look into all the bribes...

467
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,559
you received for the last 10 years.

468
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,599
I don't know what you mean by that.

469
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,960
Is this how you're going to play it? Fine.

470
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,870
I have all the evidence.

471
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
Hey.

472
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,680
What are you investigating?

473
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,019
What do you mean?

474
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,550
Look at you playing innocent.

475
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,959
Han Joon Hee is in the
interrogation room...

476
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,320
with Cheonmun Group committees.

477
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,890
You brought them, didn't you?

478
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,490
What?

479
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,530
We never heard of it.

480
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,130
You didn't know?

481
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,470
No. He didn't tell us anything.

482
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
What's he thinking?

483
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,270
After he had a meeting
with Chief Prosecutor,

484
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,310
he let Hong Mi Ae and Lee Yoon Ho free.

485
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,779
Why is he working on the
unnecessary ones now?

486
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,350
What did you say?

487
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,979
After Prosecutor Han had a
meeting with Chief Prosecutor,

488
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,650
he let Hong Mi Ae and Lee Yoon Ho free?

489
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,920
You don't need to know.

490
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,990
What was that?

491
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,330
Don't you think Prosecutor Han is fishy?

492
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
What do you mean?

493
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:05,399
I couldn't understand why he let...

494
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,970
Hong Mi Ae and Lee Yoon Ho free.

495
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,569
Usually, if someone gives
50,000 dollars and embezzle...

496
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,086
300,000 dollars of company
budget, they'd get imprisoned.

497
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,009
Do you think Prosecutor Han...

498
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,450
let them go after getting a
bribe from Chief Prosecutor?

499
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,920
You're thinking too much.

500
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,780
Have you forgotten who he is?

501
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,519
Nothing would make him change his mind...

502
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,459
even if it's Chief Prosecutor...

503
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,359
or it's from the Blue House.

504
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,459
I've been working with him for many years.

505
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,399
Why do you think...

506
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,559
he's investigating Cheonmun Group
committees without telling us?

507
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,570
He probably has his own reason.

508
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,340
Small birds like us will never
know what's on his mind.

509
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,770
Right. You're a small bird. I'm a crow.

510
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,180
Dad.

511
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,150
Dad, how are you today?

512
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,560
Mi Ae will hold...

513
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,050
a special general shareholders'
meeting tomorrow.

514
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,930
Even if you were in your right mind,

515
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,270
you'd be on Mi Ae's side.

516
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,210
- I'll go freshen up.
- Okay.

517
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,790
I finally got to see you, Hong Il Gwon.

518
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,730
If it weren't for you,

519
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,700
our family would've lived happily.

520
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,000
You ruined everything.

521
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,770
I won't let you die in peace like this.

522
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,109
As you all know,

523
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,179
(2017 Cheonmun Group Special
Shareholders' Meeting)

524
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,180
my father...

525
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,990
Chairman Hong is in hospital
for a chronic illness.

526
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,090
Considering his condition,
his recovery is doubtful.

527
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,559
If the position of chairman is
left vacant for a long time,

528
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,730
it will cause enormous trouble
in running the company.

529
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,200
So I called the meeting today.

530
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,170
- Is there any objection?
- I have an objection.

531
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,040
- What?
- It's true he is in hospital,

532
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,010
but the company is performing
well with the proxy system.

533
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,380
The chairman already announced...

534
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,516
he'd officially retire as
Chairman of the company...

535
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,780
due to the inheritance issue.

536
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,480
I don't think we have to elect...

537
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,190
a new chairperson now.

538
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,659
Hey, a puppet boss is not a real owner.

539
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,659
The owner should make decisions.

540
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,630
This is an official meeting.

541
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,630
Please stop being rude.

542
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,500
Let's decide by a show of hands.

543
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,670
Let's make it simple...

544
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,300
and get back to work. Okay?

545
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,610
All right then.

546
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,139
Except Chairman Hong, Hong Shin Ae and I...

547
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,980
have the first shareholding.

548
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,150
You're supposed to choose
between these two people.

549
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,890
You can cast a vote with your holding.

550
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,890
The one who gets the most votes...

551
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,619
will be the new chairperson.

552
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,360
I know this is planned out.

553
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,206
What's the point of taking a vote?

554
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,160
Because this is a democratic society.

555
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,130
Ms. Hong Shin Ae, if you have a problem,

556
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,700
you may bow out.

557
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
Please cast a vote using your smartphone.

558
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,510
Let's begin.

559
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,139
(The result of the poll)

560
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,310
I'll announce the result of the poll.

561
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,980
(Hong Mi Ae 5,267,500 shares,
Hong Shin Ae 5,593,200 shares)

562
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,850
- What?
- Gosh.

563
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,750
What's going on?

564
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,730
- What's that?
- Is something wrong?

565
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,166
What's happening?

566
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,430
Now I hereby announce
the new chairperson...

567
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,870
of Cheonmun Group...

568
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,200
is Hong Shin Ae.

569
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,540
Hey!

570
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,820
Darn it!

571
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:18,890
Gosh.

572
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,220
Here.

573
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,420
Thank you.

574
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,760
Prosecutor Han.

575
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,560
Jung Hye, come here.

576
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,030
Come toast with us.

577
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,676
- All right.
- Congratulations.

578
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,100
For Chairwoman of Cheonmun Group.

579
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,070
- For Chairwoman.
- For Chairwoman.

580
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,050
Let's have a seat.

581
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,180
This is nice.

582
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,650
It still hasn't hit me yet.

583
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,520
When I calculated the votes,

584
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,489
I was sure Mi Ae would win.

585
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,019
I know. What were the
dissident votes about?

586
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,730
That's because of Prosecutor
Han's under-the-table work.

587
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,329
He pried into Yoon Ho's
borrowed-name bank accounts...

588
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,960
and the executives' secrets.

589
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,830
Really?

590
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,540
Chief Prosecutor Yoon helped me a lot.

591
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,116
All I did was draw the
sword from its scabbard...

592
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,870
with the given data.

593
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,079
You look so amazing today.
Do you know that?

594
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,140
I know. Maybe I should give him
a piggy-back ride or something.

595
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,180
Should I feel threatened by him?

596
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,250
I'm not kidding. You are really amazing.

597
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,890
I thought you were just a taciturn man,

598
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,730
but he lets his actions speak for himself.

599
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,736
He's just like you, Dad.

600
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,430
You're praising both of us, right?

601
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Stop it.

602
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,560
Let's make a toast again.

603
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,530
Jung Hye.

604
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,180
Dad.

605
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,780
I fell for her.

606
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,710
Shin Ae did it...

607
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,120
behind my back.

608
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,920
If you were with me, it
wouldn't have happened.

609
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,030
Why are you lying down here like that?

610
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,130
Stop it, Mom.

611
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,360
You should've left your
property to me sooner.

612
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,470
Why did you make me suffer
such a humiliation like this?

613
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm so furious. I can't believe this.

614
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,010
Dad. Dad.

615
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,616
Please say something.

616
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,810
- Dad.
- Just stop it!

617
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,480
You can just live with the shares you have.

618
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,520
Why do you want to become
a chairwoman so bad?

619
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,196
What did you just say?

620
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,850
Don't rub salt in the wound.

621
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,766
The whole thing happened
because you're like this!

622
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,689
Why are you taking it out on me?

623
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,559
You should've got your head right.

624
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,999
If you did, the executives
wouldn't have cast the votes...

625
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,730
to the daughter of a
concubine instead of you.

626
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,300
- You jerk!
- Stop it!

627
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,800
It's no use crying over spilled milk.

628
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,870
I'm going.

629
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,240
Lee Yoon Ho!

630
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,440
What's wrong with the door?

631
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,380
Dad.

632
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,579
Gosh.

633
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,850
I'm so frustrated.

634
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,730
Did Prosecutor Han leave?

635
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,830
- Yes.
- I told you.

636
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,600
I really need him.

637
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,469
Make sure to be nice to him.

638
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,270
Still, he's not marriage material.

639
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,810
He's not attractive at all.

640
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,340
You said he was amazing.

641
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,010
I was just being nice to him.

642
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,380
Is it that...

643
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,880
you have Jang Dol Mok in mind?

644
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,990
It's true Dol Mok is...

645
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,120
much more attractive than Prosecutor Han.

646
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,960
I've never seen a man who's
so attractive before.

647
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,030
- You can't marry him.
- Why not?

648
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,466
You just can't.

649
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,400
Don't even think about it.
He's too dangerous.

650
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,340
Right.

651
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,310
Do you know a guy called Mr. Choi?

652
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,709
- Mr. Choi?
- He came to the hospital yesterday.

653
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,140
He said he used to work for Grandfather.

654
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,580
I think Grandfather came
to himself at that moment.

655
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,620
What did he say?

656
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,120
I don't quite remember what I heard.

657
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,920
Grandfather sounded very angry though.

658
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,630
I think he talked about maps.

659
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,376
You fabricated his will?

660
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,470
Are you out of your mind?

661
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,676
It's a fraud by Additional
Punishment Law on Specific Crimes.

662
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,820
You even threatened the
executives of Cheonmun Group.

663
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,250
You'd be sentenced to at
least five years in prison.

664
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,380
- I know that.
- Then why did you do that?

665
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,486
Because I have to win Chief
Prosecutor Yoon's confidence.

666
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,750
So what's the result?

667
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,656
Hong Shin Ae got Cheonmun
Group in her hand,

668
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,290
but you're just her pawn.

669
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,626
Now that Yoon Joong Tae has your weakness,

670
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,496
you'll have to do as you're told.

671
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,040
I'm not the only one who's blindsided.

672
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,630
I also have something on him.

673
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,460
He's the one...

674
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,060
who instigated the whole thing.

675
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,840
Dol Mok, if I can't get a confession
about your father's death,

676
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,510
I'll jump off a cliff...

677
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,540
holding Chief Prosecutor Yoon in my arms.

678
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,650
The statute of limitations on
the case has expired already.

679
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,650
If we fail to find the maps...

680
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:15,050
or to reveal the historical truth,

681
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,950
it might be a better option.

682
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,170
What are you talking about?

683
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,920
Why would you do that?

684
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,230
This is about my biological father.

685
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,530
Because you're my brother.

686
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,130
If you fight, I'll fight with you.

687
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,430
I'll sacrifice myself rather
than to see you get hurt.

688
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,740
You've done your best with Dad so far.

689
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,950
I'll never let them go from
strength to strength like that.

690
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,310
What will you do then?

691
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,630
Did you hear that?

692
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,170
Hong Shin Ae took over Cheonmun Group.

693
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,770
Take me...

694
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,510
to the police station.

695
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,740
No, call the police for me.

696
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,250
You said you can't trust the
police or the prosecution.

697
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,050
What do you want to do?

698
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,626
Yoon Joong Tae tried to kill me.

699
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,990
I'll tell them about it.

700
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,120
The medical officer tried to
kill me in the detention center.

701
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,890
I heard him talking on the phone.

702
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,790
Hey, Mr. Hong Il Gwon.

703
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,710
Do you think an attempted murderer...

704
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,170
would admit that...

705
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,169
he tried to kill you?

706
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,570
You saw that too.

707
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,370
Yoon Joong Tae tried to kill me.

708
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
I did.

709
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,340
But why would I...

710
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,140
stand as a witness for you?

711
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,480
Even your own daughter remains silent.

712
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,720
Why would I have to do that and
reveal why I was hiding here?

713
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,020
He'll simply deny it.

714
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Then...

715
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
call my attorneys over here.

716
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,000
I'll change my will...

717
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,900
and give all the stocks I have to Mi Ae.

718
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,200
This way,

719
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,340
she can take over...

720
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,510
the ownership of Cheonmun.

721
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,680
Please help me. Please.

722
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,950
Please. I admit...

723
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,460
that I kidnapped your biological father,

724
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,660
foster father, and Great Aunt.

725
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,900
I admit all these.

726
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,600
And I will pay the price
for my wrongdoings.

727
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,270
Please tell me everything you want from me.

728
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,340
Please accept my sincere apology.

729
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,220
Mr. Hong,

730
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,560
play it cool.

731
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,330
Do you think Mi Ae will
be able to keep it...

732
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,770
if you leave everything to her?

733
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:22,600
Yoon Joong Tae can put your daughter
behind bars anytime he wants.

734
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,440
It might be better for them...

735
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,010
to live with what they've got.

736
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,780
Do you want to make Mi Ae and Yoon Ho...

737
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,020
end up like you now?

738
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,290
Then...

739
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,390
should I just let him do
whatever he wants to do?

740
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,760
I will take revenge on Joong Tae for you.

741
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,760
Then will you do as I say?

742
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,410
I want to change...

743
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,680
my will.

744
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,659
So that old geezer gained
his consciousness...

745
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,220
when he met with Choi Tae Seok.

746
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,000
If that old fox is playing
the fool with me,

747
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,170
does it mean he knows
that I tried to kill him?

748
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,070
Are you sure?

749
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,340
Yes. I think he recovered his senses.

750
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,809
Mom, wouldn't he try to change his will...

751
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,410
once he fully regains his consciousness?

752
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,150
Then, he'll leave everything to Aunt Mi Ae.

753
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,750
You might not be able to take
the chairperson position then.

754
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,890
That's not good.

755
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,130
I won't let it happen.

756
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,230
It's not over yet.

757
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,629
What are you saying? It's too late now.

758
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,970
I just need to inherit everything.

759
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,900
Then I can throw Shin Ae out.

760
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,109
We can open his will only
after he passes away.

761
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,079
We'll have more stocks if he passes away.

762
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,879
But we don't know when he'll pass away.

763
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,780
That can happen anytime soon.

764
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,820
He almost died twice already.

765
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,960
Hong Il Gwon.

766
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,200
You'll meet your nemesis
just like Yoon Joong Tae.

767
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,770
Stop lying!

768
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:41,710
It was you who first took my map.

769
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,810
I trusted you,

770
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,320
and you collude with Joong Tae?

771
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,550
I won't let it slide once
I recover my health.

772
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,960
You'll be the first one
to be taken care of.

773
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,200
What is this?

774
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,170
I'm returning your kindness
when we were four with this.

775
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,270
Isn't it too petty compared to my kindness?

776
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,740
I'll repay it throughout my life.

777
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,180
You're wearing lipstick.

778
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,049
I am. I put on makeup for a change,

779
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,090
and I looked weird with bare lips.

780
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,990
I can't kiss you as I want
if you wear lipstick.

781
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,690
What? You're so selfish.

782
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:31,690
I heard...

783
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,030
that women eat about one
lipstick every year.

784
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,720
And men eat one and a half of it.

785
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,600
I don't want to die young.

786
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,820
I'll live happily with you for a long time.

787
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,816
Will you do nothing with me
when I'm so pretty like this...

788
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,940
just to live long?

789
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:48,910
Fine.

790
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,810
I'll willingly die young then.

791
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,590
No way. Do you really want to live long?

792
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:08,100
There.

793
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:21,610
It looks good.

794
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,910
Let me put it in your mouth.
Open your mouth.

795
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,370
You're like a vamp.

796
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:47,400
This is nothing.

797
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,100
Gosh.

798
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,870
I guess you won't like this.

799
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,210
What is it?

800
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:57,910
Open it.

801
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,250
(A coupon to use Jang Dol Mok for a day)

802
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,390
When did you make it?

803
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,290
Right after you moved into Sanwoonyul.

804
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:12,006
When were you planning
to give this to me then?

805
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,630
Always, whenever I had a chance.

806
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,370
- Can I scratch it?
- Go ahead.

807
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,930
It's for you anyway.

808
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,709
(I'm sorry, but only a kiss is allowed.)

809
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,680
What is this?

810
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,310
You said you made it when I moved in.

811
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,320
Then you already imagined
kissing me back then?

812
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,760
I just wished I could.

813
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,860
Goodness.

814
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,090
Let me scratch one more.

815
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,200
(My goodness. You can
spend a night with me.)

816
00:45:58,510 --> 00:45:59,886
Why? What is it?

817
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,640
It's nothing.

818
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,950
(My goodness. You can
spend a night with me.)

819
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,470
By the way, it's not valid
after the expiration date.

820
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:14,930
Make sure to use them soon.

821
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,390
Open your mouth.

822
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,716
(Seoul Jeil University Hospital)

823
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,340
He passed away because
of cardiac infarction...

824
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,740
at 2am.

825
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,979
The doctor attempted CPR right
after he found the symptom,

826
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,880
but there wasn't anything he could
do as it was his third time.

827
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,070
Dad...

828
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,570
Dad...

829
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,770
What's going on, Dad?

830
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,239
Dad...

831
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,909
He was fine yesterday. What
on earth happened to him?

832
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,879
This is my fault. Please
wake up, Grandfather.

833
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,486
- Grandfather...
- I can't believe this.

834
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,579
Dad.

835
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,650
How can this happen all of a sudden?

836
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,480
- Father.
- Dad.

837
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,020
Father.

838
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,219
How dare you...

839
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,936
How dare you come here?

840
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,966
- You killed him, didn't you?
- Stop it!

841
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,659
- You killed my dad.
- Stop it already.

842
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,930
Dad...

843
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,330
Goodness. My poor dad...

844
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,629
All the wealth is useless.

845
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,739
- Grandfather.
- He died in the end.

846
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,900
Grandfather, open your eyes.

847
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,910
- Dad...
- Dad!

848
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,550
- This is nonsense.
- Dad...

849
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,090
Have you heard the news?

850
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,460
Chairman Hong of Cheonmun Group died.

851
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,830
He had a heart attack
early in the morning...

852
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:38,530
and died instantly.

853
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:39,800
- Sorry?
- Sorry?

854
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,670
That's hard to believe.

855
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,709
We were in the middle of
preparing for the trial.

856
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,039
And what on earth is this?

857
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,409
What happens to the trial then?

858
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,780
What do you mean? The
person involved is dead.

859
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,709
The prosecution will be suspended.

860
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,480
Goodness, what a waste.

861
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,420
We prepared for this trial for months.

862
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,250
But Joon Hee, you acted quite quickly.

863
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,420
What do you mean?

864
00:49:00,421 --> 00:49:03,020
Yesterday, shareholders' meeting was held.

865
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,360
Chief Prosecutor Yoon's wife is
going to run the company now.

866
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,100
What? Really?

867
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,630
But isn't the eldest daughter
holding most of the shares?

868
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:13,600
That's what the media reported.

869
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,800
However,

870
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,410
some voted against the popular sentiment.

871
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,770
Of all the people,

872
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:21,670
the executives he investigated
voted for Chief Prosecutor's wife.

873
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,940
Could this be coincidence?

874
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,490
My investigation has nothing
to do with the voting.

875
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,520
Is that so?

876
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,590
But...

877
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,320
after you investigated them,
they changed their stance.

878
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,130
How would I beat you in this mind game?

879
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,660
Good for you.

880
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,600
You're Chief Prosecutor's favorite.

881
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,490
Now, all you have left to do
is get on the fast track.

882
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,450
Goodness, the universe can be mean.

883
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,349
He has committed countless crimes.

884
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,780
He ought to pay for his crimes.

885
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,026
He lost consciousness not
long after getting locked up.

886
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,289
They moved him to a ward,
but look at what happened.

887
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,660
"I will take good care of you..."

888
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,460
"on your way to your afterlife."

889
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,689
Is this some kind of a new business?

890
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,390
Even the universe is siding with the rich.

891
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,429
In a way, the universe is making it
easy for the rich to die peacefully.

892
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,270
What a piece of garbage. He didn't
give me a chance to take my revenge.

893
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,400
Forget it.

894
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,676
Don't even think about taking your revenge.

895
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,286
If you have time to think for that,

896
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,040
focus on rehabilitating your leg.

897
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:28,479
You're only worrying about Mr. Jang.

898
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,780
Hey, you. That's not it.

899
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,309
Goodness, the best way...

900
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,030
to take your revenge is living your
life to the fullest. Understood?

901
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,190
But how can that old man cope with dying?

902
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,590
He left so much money behind.

903
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,320
Doesn't this look fishy?

904
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,336
Before he was sent to the detention center,

905
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,429
he was acting all confident.

906
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,129
Out of the blue, he lost consciousness...

907
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,630
and died.

908
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,630
What are you implying?

909
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:53,699
Are you saying his daughters did
something to get his money?

910
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,070
That makes sense.

911
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,669
When it comes to money, love,
loyalty, and family...

912
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:58,870
are no use.

913
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,210
When I became penniless after
Cheonmun Group stole my invention,

914
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,280
my wife packed up her things and left.

915
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:07,680
Then who's going to take
over Cheonmun Group?

916
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,980
He only has one grandson, Lee Yoon Ho.

917
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,866
Hey, you. I think you've
gotten the wrong idea.

918
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:16,519
Marrying a rich guy is the
same as living in prison.

919
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,690
Why did you let this
octopus stay in our house?

920
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,960
Hey, where is Dol Mok?

921
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,636
He wasn't in his office.

922
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,200
Did he go to meet So Joo?

923
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:47,960
I am going to revise my will.

924
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,790
I am Chairman Hong Il Gwon's doctor.

925
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,470
After Chairman Hong collapsed
in the detention center,

926
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:00,100
he was transferred to this hospital.

927
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:03,870
It is true that for a while, his
consciousness wasn't stable.

928
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,610
However, as of now,

929
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,410
he has fully regained his consciousness.

930
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,510
Chairman Hong...

931
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,350
has requested not...

932
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:15,780
to inform his family for his own safety,

933
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:17,930
and I complied with his request.

934
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,329
What is this? So Dad had put
up an act in front of us?

935
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:27,490
Because he couldn't trust us?

936
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,000
Goodness, Grandfather...

937
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,930
is surprising us even
until his last moment.

938
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:34,170
Please keep it down.

939
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,700
He hasn't even started yet.

940
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,410
Considering my physical health,

941
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,570
before I lose more time,

942
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,891
in order to wrap up the matter
regarding the inheritance,

943
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,480
I have decided to film this video.

944
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,620
Even before I was arrested,

945
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,490
through Attorney Jang,

946
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,090
I was going to revise my will.

947
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,860
I have Attorney Jung and
Kim as my witnesses.

948
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:00,060
I'd like to...

949
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,040
delegate authority to Attorney Jang
Dol Mok regarding everything...

950
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,400
including the inheritances.

951
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,740
- Jang Dol Mok?
- Dad.

952
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,610
Hello, everyone.

953
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,610
I am Attorney Jang Dol Mok...

954
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,980
in charge of executing
Chairman Hong Il Gwon's will.

955
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,750
You all know who I am, don't you?

956
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,720
What's going on?

957
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,490
Why would Dad entrust him
to execute his will?

958
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:34,159
That's right. Grandfather knows that
this jerk siphoned the money...

959
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,529
from Cheonmun Group and framed me
for embezzlement. Why would he?

960
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,970
He must've wanted to teach you
a lesson, Mr. Lee Yoon Ho.

961
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,700
He especially asked me to look after you.

962
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:47,580
- What?
- I know you are a competent lawyer.

963
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,979
Why would he ask Attorney Jang to
handle this after disregarding...

964
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,250
2 attorneys who've been with
our family over 30 years?

965
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,150
I can't understand this.

966
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:56,596
How did this happen?

967
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,420
We don't know the details.

968
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,690
The chairman put us up as witnesses...

969
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,990
and appointed Attorney Jang
as the attorney of record.

970
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,060
All right.

971
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,530
Can I disclose his will?

972
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,409
("Many Came to Pay Their
Respects to His Wake")

973
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,510
("A Complete Coverage from
His Arrest to Death")

974
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,060
Investigator Kang, what are you doing?
You didn't have lunch?

975
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,620
Prosecutor.

976
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,306
Is your investigation of
Cheonmun Group's committees...

977
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,050
irrelevant to Hong Shin Ae being appointed?

978
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,500
Are you still on that?

979
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,220
Under the circumstances, what
Senior Prosecutor said made sense.

980
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,540
Why did you investigate them?

981
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,340
Investigator Kang!

982
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,286
I investigated them on the
suspicion of corruption.

983
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,380
What corruption?

984
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,380
Was their corruption worse than
Hong Mi Ae or Lee Yoon Ho's?

985
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:01,150
Why are you investigating them in secret?

986
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,480
Hey, Kang So Joo!

987
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,250
Have you lost your mind?

988
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,490
How dare you insult Prosecutor Han?

989
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,760
- Investigator Nam, what's wrong?
- Stay out of it.

990
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,520
Apologize to him right now.

991
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:13,530
How could you be so ungrateful?

992
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,630
How could you insult him? He
brought you here from Chuncheon.

993
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,429
- Stop it.
- This newbie went too far.

994
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,440
I told you to stop.

995
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,610
I'll apologize if my speculation is wrong.

996
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,086
However, as your subordinate,

997
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,510
I'm politely asking you a question.

998
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,680
I'm going to arrest Hong Mi
Ae and Lee Yoon Ho one day.

999
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,496
But let me just say that right now
isn't the right time for that.

1000
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,560
Did my answer satisfy you?

1001
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,706
Aunt and your shares are about 330,000.

1002
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,770
Even if Grandfather was furious at Dad,

1003
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,386
there's no way he didn't
leave anything for us.

1004
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,780
Yoon Hwa Young, don't even think about it.

1005
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,880
Didn't you hear from Attorney Jung...

1006
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:06,050
that Dad wasn't going to
give you a single share...

1007
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:07,880
before he collapsed?

1008
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:15,066
Every real estate property, saving account,

1009
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:16,620
antique, and national treasure...

1010
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,290
under Chairman Hong's possession...

1011
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:21,270
will be donated to the families of
deceased independence fighters.

1012
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,329
Two million shares out of...

1013
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,100
Chairman Hong's 8,206,000 shares
related to Cheonmun Group...

1014
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,116
will be used as funds for
a scholarship project...

1015
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,109
of children from low-income families.

1016
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,170
Hey, Jang Dol Mok.

1017
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,280
Are you sure my dad wrote that will?

1018
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,756
After I disclose the will,

1019
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:42,120
I will disclose the chairman's recording.
So please be patient.

1020
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:48,466
2 million shares out of his
remaining 6.2 million shares...

1021
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,660
are left for his eldest
daughter, Hong Mi Ae.

1022
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,760
In addition, his grandson, Lee Yoon Ho...

1023
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,900
will receive 1.2 million shares.

1024
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,070
It's over, Mom.

1025
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,176
If we combine our shares,
we have 3.2 million shares.

1026
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,770
Cheonmun Group is ours now.

1027
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:07,510
Okay. Wait a second.

1028
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:11,380
Then what about the rest
of three million shares?

1029
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,350
What's going to happen to those?

1030
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,150
One million shares of...

1031
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:20,170
the remaining three million shares
will be given to Yoon Hwa Young.

1032
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:22,236
And the rest of two million shares...

1033
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,260
will be passed down to Hong Shin Ae.

1034
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:26,960
Hey!

1035
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,100
This is nonsense! How can she...

1036
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,670
How can I be treated just like
her, a mistress' daughter?

1037
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:37,440
Mom, Aunt has 8,467,000 shares.

1038
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,410
We have 8,593,000 shares.

1039
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,440
We still have the control over the company.

1040
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:45,080
Ms. Yoon Hwa Young, we are not done yet.

1041
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:50,280
However, Hong Shin Ae will
receive two millions dollars...

1042
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,020
under the condition that she divorces...

1043
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,590
Yoon Joong Tae.

1044
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:01,929
If she doesn't divorce him within a month,

1045
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:04,670
the shares left for Hong Shin Ae
will be donated to the society.

1046
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,340
However, in the case of
Hong Shin Ae's death,

1047
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,400
the shares will be passed onto
his son-in-law, Yoon Joong Tae.

1048
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:15,810
Hold on. He still has 6,000 shares left.

1049
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,556
In the case that you two live
happily until your death,

1050
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,850
he has left the remaining
6,000 shares for both of you.

1051
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,630
Attorney Jang.

1052
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:44,486
I was going to say hello, but I was busy.

1053
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:46,950
Why did you become an attorney
for someone like Hong Il Gwon?

1054
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,009
He's a descendant of a pro-Japanese family.

1055
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,250
He has caused harm to society.

1056
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,280
I'm a lawyer.

1057
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,220
I only did what I had to do as a lawyer.

1058
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,290
Were you a lawyer who sells your soul?

1059
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,690
Didn't you quit fencing...

1060
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,660
because the Hong family bribed the judge?

1061
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,800
That's the past,

1062
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:14,470
and this is about the will.

1063
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,490
I can't help it. I can't just watch it.

1064
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,230
What do you mean?

1065
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,630
Are you saying you'll divorce me?

1066
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,229
Then do you want me to
watch Mi Ae take over...

1067
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:46,670
Cheonmun Group?

1068
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:48,500
I'll never let that happen.

1069
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,810
You're finally revealing yourself.

1070
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:55,510
You're willing to dump
me if it's for money.

1071
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,450
What about you?

1072
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,820
Are you trying to kill me too...

1073
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,549
just like how you...

1074
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,659
tried to kill Dad to take my portion?

1075
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,666
Watch your mouth.

1076
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,906
Why do you think Dad added that condition?

1077
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:13,530
It was to save me from you.

1078
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,700
If I die now,

1079
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,799
you'll be blamed for
killing me for my fortune,

1080
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,340
so you can't dare to get your hands on me.

1081
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,340
You're out of control now.

1082
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,480
You denounce me for what I didn't do?
Well...

1083
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,810
I knew I'm only...

1084
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,720
a shield to protect you from the complex.

1085
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:36,979
What did you say?

1086
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,789
The only way to get your
father's attention...

1087
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:40,150
as a concubine's daughter...

1088
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:43,066
was to cover up his disgrace
of being a pro-Japanese...

1089
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,590
by using me.

1090
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,400
How could you say that?

1091
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,700
Is that why...

1092
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,030
you told Father...

1093
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,340
about your corruption to bring me down?

1094
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,669
When I tried to imprison Father...

1095
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:00,940
for the gold collection case,

1096
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:04,109
do you think I didn't know you stopped me?

1097
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:05,310
That's great.

1098
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,080
Everything will clear up if we divorce.

1099
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:21,500
What if Aunt Shin Ae really gets a divorce?

1100
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,130
I mean, they're too old to talk about love.

1101
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:27,946
Since she has the money, if
she gets Cheonmun Group,

1102
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:30,870
young men will line up to serve her.

1103
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:32,070
Don't you think?

1104
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,980
I must stop her from divorcing...

1105
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,910
by all means necessary.

1106
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,730
Get out of there.

1107
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,899
That's not your place anymore.

1108
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,399
It still belongs to me.

1109
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,276
Have you forgotten the committees chose me?

1110
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,030
You'll lose it soon.

1111
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,440
Have you forgotten about the inheritance?

1112
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,410
You're not...

1113
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,956
thinking about dumping
your husband, are you?

1114
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:14,920
For money that you consider ridiculous?

1115
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:16,920
You said...

1116
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:20,420
you'd choose love over money
and chose your husband.

1117
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,260
You even live with the man you don't love.

1118
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:27,400
Getting a divorce for the record...

1119
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,176
won't stop me from loving him.

1120
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,770
Stop joking.

1121
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,270
Say what you have to say.

1122
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:41,810
It's not your husband you love...

1123
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,880
but money.

1124
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,780
After all, you're going to divorce...

1125
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,350
to get Cheonmun Group.

1126
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,850
Don't pretend to be so elegant.

1127
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,220
Right.

1128
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,230
If you don't get Cheonmun Group,

1129
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,330
you're left without money,

1130
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,900
love, and power.

1131
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:10,239
I'll reach the place you
can't even imagine,

1132
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,870
so watch what I can do.

1133
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:16,180
All the insulting your
mom has done to my mom.

1134
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,150
I'll return it all to you.

1135
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,990
- Lawyer Jang Dol Mok?
- Yes.

1136
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,059
He's the inheritance lawyer,

1137
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,760
and he ruined everything.

1138
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,600
No way.

1139
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,669
How is that possible?

1140
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:42,170
That's what I want to ask you.
What were you doing?

1141
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,570
I was manipulating the will...

1142
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,740
with the lawyers just like you said.

1143
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,980
We should be glad that...

1144
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,680
Chairman Hong didn't announce
it when he was conscious.

1145
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,880
Then both you and I...

1146
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,119
would be in trouble.

1147
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,289
That old man stabbed me in the back...

1148
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:01,990
before he died.

1149
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,760
He was pretending he was unconscious.

1150
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,230
What should I do now?

1151
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,760
I won't let...

1152
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,470
Jang Dol Mok get away with this.

1153
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,900
How could he dare side up
with him and attack me?

1154
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,270
But we must find the last map.

1155
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:36,660
Hello.

1156
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,160
I was thinking about paying you a visit,

1157
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:41,430
but I thought it'd make you upset.

1158
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:45,570
When did you start to side
up with Chairman Hong?

1159
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,370
Did you contact him first...

1160
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,340
or did he call you?

1161
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:53,310
Whatever it was,

1162
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,740
we decided to side up because
we have the same goal.

1163
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,250
So...

1164
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,220
what did you two talk about?

1165
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,590
You sound like you're interrogating me.

1166
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:08,660
You're not my boss.

1167
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,030
I didn't commit any crime in this case.

1168
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,830
You're the one all tensed up now.

1169
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:19,570
You're probably well aware...

1170
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:21,910
how serious murder instigation
and attempted murder are.

1171
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,740
You look like you're suitable for prison.

1172
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:28,840
You look like a petty criminal.

1173
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,280
Don't accuse me without evidence.

1174
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,890
A rookie like you is no match for me.

1175
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,190
I'm sure...

1176
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,460
you want to...

1177
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:46,190
strangle me now.

1178
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,260
Just like how you killed...

1179
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,070
my dad Kim Chan Gi 25 years ago.

1180
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:28,839
(The Good Thieves)

1181
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,469
Do you have anything to say to me?

1182
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:33,539
I was in charge of Chairman
Hong's inheritance matter.

1183
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:34,840
Are you out of your mind?

1184
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,180
Did you do something to kill your dad?

1185
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,410
What did you say?

1186
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,579
How dare you use me to cover up your crime?

1187
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,449
What were you doing on the
night your dad passed away?

1188
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:45,119
What took you so long to arrive?

1189
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,759
Hong Il Gwon is dead, and the
person who benefits the most...

1190
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,060
out of this is Hong Shin Ae.

1191
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,630
It smells fishy.

1192
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,930
No one is getting in my way.

1193
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,706
It's time for me to spread my wings.

1194
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,830
Let's see who wins.

1195
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,599
I'll reveal the ugly
details of your family...

1196
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,610
and prove all the crimes you committed.
