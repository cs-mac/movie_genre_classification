- WE'RE HERE?

172
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,267
- YOU READY?
- YES.

173
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,336
- OKAY.
YOU CAN OPEN THEM.

174
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:18,709
IT'S A HOUSE.

175
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,378
- YEP.
WHAT THE FUCK?

176
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,713
- JENNY, WHAT?

177

- NO, IS THIS--

178
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,750
IS THIS A JOKE?

179
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:29,420
- NO, IT'S NOT A JOKE.

180
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,192
- DID YOU THINK THAT I WOULD
THINK THIS IS FUNNY?

181
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:36,693
- IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE--

182
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:38,529
- BRINGING ME TO A HAUNTED HOUSE
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

183
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,563
- IT'S NOT A HAUNTED HOUSE.

184
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:40,764
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE FUNNY.

185
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,934
- TAKE ME HOME.

186
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:45,236
- THIS IS HOME.

00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,105
- WHAT?

188
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:50,541

FOR US.

190
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:21,172
- HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

191
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,174
WHAT ABOUT OUR APARTMENT?

192
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,143
WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?

193
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:28,179
THIS IS SO FRICKIN' YOU.

194
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,446

ON SOME CRAZY
REAL ESTATE SPECULATION.

202
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,463
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
IT IS TRASH.

203

LET'S GET BACK TOGETHER.

209
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:58,041
- WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

210
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:00,944
- IT MEANS I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S BOUNCING AROUND.

211
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:09,353
OPEN IT.

- I KNOW THAT LAST LINE
DIDN'T RHYME,

BUT IT CAME FROM THE HEART.

222
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:55,399
THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER
IN THERE.

223
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,103
- YOU SIGNED MY NAME?

224

- YOU ARE A HOMEOWNER.

- IT'S A PROPERTY INVESTMENT.

227
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:11,148
I'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERY DAY
SINCE DECEMBER,

228
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,616
AND I FOUND IT ONLINE.

229
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:15,653
SO I DROVE UP HERE, AND I MADE
AN OFFER THAT DAY.

230
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,488
AND, LOOK, I KNOW IT'S NOT
YOUR DREAM HOUSE,

231
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,857
BUT IT'S BIG,

232
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:24,828
AND IT COMES
WITH A LOT OF LAND.

233
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,930
- HOW MUCH LAND?
- 40 ACRES.

- WOW.

235
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,767

THROW IN A MULE,

BUT NO DICE.

237
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,170
- NO DICE.

238

- IF WE MARKET IT RIGHT,

239
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:35,906
WE COULD FLIP THIS HOUSE,

240
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:37,140
AND WE COULD MAKE
A LOT OF MONEY:

241
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,810
PAY OFF OUR STUDENT LOANS,

242
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:44,981
AND WE COULD DO THE WEDDING
IN HAWAII.

- THAT'S, LIKE, FREE.

261
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,059
WHY?

262
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,127
- BECAUSE THIS IS
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,

263
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,929
AND NO ONE ELSE WANTS TO BE
OUT HERE.

- HEY, IT'S OKAY.
AT LEAST WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

268
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:44,708
- THAT BETTER BE ENOUGH,

269
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,577
BECAUSE WITH A HOUSE
IN BUMFUCK, EGYPT,

270

WE REALLY DON'T HAVE
MUCH CHOICE.

- HAVEN'T CHECKED THIS OUT
REALLY YET.

664
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:24,721

- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE FUN?
- NO.

695
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,291

700
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:42,565
AND--NO.
IT'LL BE FUN.

701
00:36:42,566 --> 00:36:45,335
- HE HAS MORE HAIR ON HIS BACK
THAN HE HAS ON HIS HEAD.

702

- I KNOW, BUT THEN

703
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,237
YOU COULD JUST RUN
YOUR FINGERS THROUGH IT.

704
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:51,641
- A LITTLE TESTOSTERONE OVERDOSE
WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU.

705
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,676
- IT'S GOING TO BE
A LONG WEEKEND.

706
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:56,546
- I WOULD NOT BANG MIKE
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

707
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,247
- 10 BUCKS SHE DOES.

708
00:36:58,248 --> 00:36:59,849
- I'LL TAKE THAT ACTION.

709

FOR ONE DAY TOO.

721
00:37:20,203 --> 00:37:21,270

THE KEY FOR THIS.

726
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:27,577
YEAH, NO, I DON'T.
