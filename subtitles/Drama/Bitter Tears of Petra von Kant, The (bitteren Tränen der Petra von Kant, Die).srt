00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:35,370
THE BITTER TEARS
OF PETRA VON KANT

2
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:40,250
A case history

3
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:46,089
dedicated to the one
who became Marlene here.

4
00:01:14,743 --> 00:01:19,080
With the special participation
of lrm Hermann as Marlene

5
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,328
Marlene...

6
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:28,209
be more considerate, please.

7
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:37,093
I've had such awful dreams.

8
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:58,865
My head is so heavy...

9
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,702
like lead.

10
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,669
The telephone.

11
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,926
Quick.

12
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,945
Mrs. Von Kant, please.

13
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:40,406
Of course, I'll wait.

14
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:45,787
Squeeze me some orange juice.

15
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,957
I'm dying of thirst.

16
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,843
Mother?

17
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:03,388
I couldn't make it yesterday.

18
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:06,766
My work, you know.

19
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,772
No, I've been up for ages.

20
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,442
It's true.

21
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:22,699
I haven't had a moment's peace.
But it has its good sides too.

22
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,744
Where are you going?

23
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:29,330
To Miami?

24
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:32,375
I'm so happy for you, Mother.

25
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,670
Miami is lovely.
Really, lovely.

26
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,921
And the people.

27
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:40,466
Wonderful to know.
Just wonderful.

28
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,177
Six months?

29
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:46,097
Oh, Mother,
I hardly know what to say.

30
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,685
Six months in Miami.
How I envy you.

31
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,855
I could do with that.

32
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,033
Thank you.

33
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,759
Start on the drawing.

34
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,720
The sketch is on the easel.

35
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,645
Yes, Mother. What was that?

36
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,649
Of course I'm listening,
but something's wrong with the line.

37
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,610
I'm sorry.

38
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:43,237
Don't get offended.

39
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:46,908
The line really was crackling.

40
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,035
I'm not lying.

41
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:52,580
Now you're being nasty, Mother.

42
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:57,043
Yes, I'm listening.

43
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,423
I understand.

44
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,802
How much do you need?

45
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,678
8,000?

46
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:10,098
That's a lot of money.

47
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:15,019
I can lend you 5,000, but no more.

48
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:17,814
What with expenses,
and then Gabriele.

49
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:20,942
Ask Tatiana, or perhaps -

50
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,402
Yes, Mother.

51
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,618
Marlene.

52
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:34,080
I want you to write a letter...

53
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,553
to Joseph Mankiewicz.

54
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:51,806
The address is in the files.

55
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,816
Dear Mankiewicz,

56
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,652
my dear friend,

57
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,487


58
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:12,994
I'm afraid I shall be unable
to make payment,

59
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,829
period.

60
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:23,671
There are circumstances
between heaven and earth...

61
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,176
dot, dot, dot...

62
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,055
But who am I talking to?
Question mark.

63
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,061
Hoping you will understand,
I remain your dear friend,

64
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,480
Petra Von Kant.

65
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,618
<i>I'll</i> sign it right away.

66
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,203
Come here.

67
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:09,759
Take it downstairs,

68
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,220
and be quick.

69
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:44,038
Well, hurry up.

70
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:47,583
That drawing must be finished by noon.

71
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,837
Any mail?

72
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,736
Karstadt?

73
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,763
Karstadt wants me
to design for them.

74
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,979
Marlene, did you hear me?

75
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,066
It's the chance of a lifetime.

76
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,883
Karstadt?

77
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,760
Mr. Müller-Freienfels, please.

78
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,848
My name is Petra Von Kant.

79
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:33,189
Petra Von Kant speaking.

80
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:36,317
Yes, I did.

81
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:39,695
But this week is full.

82
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,740
I might manage Friday.

83
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,825
One moment.

84
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:59,256
Yes, I can squeeze it in on Friday.

85
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,758
When? At 3:00?

86
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,719
Fine, at 3:00.
See you then.

87
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,560
Those rats.

88
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:22,279
Do you remember when I offered them
my first designs three years ago?

89
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,657
They didn't care.

90
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:30,162
How times change.

91
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:33,874
The man was so servile,

92
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,544
when I think about it.

93
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,797
At this hour?

94
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,924
My God, who -

95
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,051
Open the door.

96
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,889
It doesn't matter anyway.

97
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,729
It's 10:30 already.

98
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,330
Darling.

99
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,083
Sidonie.

100
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,128
My dearest!
- Petra.

101
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,171
My God.

102
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:25,009
How long has it been?
- Three years, my dear.

103
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,011
How time flies.

104
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:31,181
But you look absolutely stunning.
How do you do it?

105
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:34,184
I have nothing on you.

106
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:38,772
Your youth, your beauty.

107
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,280
And Frank?

108
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,367
I read about you two.

109
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,870
In Australia of all places.

110
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:57,207
And I said to Lester, “Poor dear.
Look what's happened.”

111
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,294
We always warned you
about that man.

112
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:04,590
We all have to have
our own experiences.

113
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:09,261
I don't regret it one bit.

114
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,141
No one can take away
the things you learn in life.

115
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,560
On the contrary,

116
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:19,396
they give you maturity.

117
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,565
I don't know, Petra.

118
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:25,361
When you can foresee the end
from the start,

119
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:28,697
is the experience alone worth it?

120
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,076
Make some coffee, Marlene.

121
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,203
Or would you prefer tea?

122
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,746
Coffee would be fine.

123
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,332
- Have you had breakfast?
- Yes.

124
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:41,669
I flew down from Frankfurt
this morning.

125
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:45,381
I was anxious to hear
how you were holding up,

126
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,133
whether you were suffering or -

127
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,184
People change.

128
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,604
I was different once, I know.

129
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:02,898
I wouldn't have known how to cope.

130
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,234
The shame of it alone.

131
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,612
I believed in the goodness
of the man.

132
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:16,870
But marriage
brings out the worst in people.

133
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,791
- I'm not so sure. With Lester-
- Oh, forgive me.

134
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:25,921
With all your travels, you never
got to know each other properly.

135
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:30,551
But Frank and I,

136
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,595
we were inseparable

137
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,974
and in constant fear
that we would fall apart.

138
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:42,771
That's when you get to know
what the other person is made of.

139
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:49,027
Sorry, I didn't want
to sound bitter, but...

140
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:55,284
there would have been
some opportunities,

141
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:59,413
really wonderful opportunities,

142
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,291
for that man and me.

143
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,670
But it was not meant to be.

144
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:11,467
- Still dreaming of him?
- No, Sidonie.

145
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,678
I just regret the chances we missed.

146
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:16,930
They certainly existed.

147
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:26,106
It's very sad,

148
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,275
believe me...

149
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,489
when you realise
that the distressing things...

150
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:40,370
by far outweigh
the beautiful things you feel.

151
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,081
Did you quarrel?

152
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,838
Quarrel?

153
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,591
Not in the normal way.

154
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,763
Sometimes there was a coldness.
You could feel it.

155
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,184
Look“.

156
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,021
You're with someone

157
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,732
in a car or in a room,

158
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:11,151
and you want to say something,

159
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,695
but you're afraid.

160
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,865
You want to be affectionate,

161
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:19,201
but again you're afraid.

162
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,246
You're afraid of losing points,

163
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,666
of being the weaker one.

164
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,795
It's a terrible moment

165
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,799
when you can no longer go back
and start again.

166
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:38,053
I think I understand what you mean.
Very vaguely, but -

167
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,348
I know what you're going to say.

168
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,893
“The wise person gives in.”

169
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,522
No, Sidonie.

170
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:53,235
Once you're in the mire,
who can pull you out again,

171
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,280
in terms of human relations?

172
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:59,366
It can't have been like that
for the whole three years.

173
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:02,911
Of course not.

174
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:07,541
At times,

175
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,168
it was so beautiful that -

176
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,092
There are moments
when you forget everything.

177
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,219
Everything-

178
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:25,809
Including the fact
that you could resolve the difficulties,

179
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:29,187
and find common ground to -

180
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,737
But we were stuck in the mire.

181
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,282
Poor thing.

182
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,747
It's easy to pity,

183
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,499
but much harder to understand.

184
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,002
If you understand someone,
there's no need for pity.

185
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,379
You can help change things.

186
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,593
Pity only what you can't understand.

187
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,178
I see.

188
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,306
The whole thing has hardened you.

189
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,433
It's a pity.

190
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:09,645
I have always been suspicious
of hard women.

191
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,105
I may seem hard,

192
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:15,025
but it's only because
I'm using my head.

193
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:18,612
You're evidently not used
to women using their brains.

194
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,322
My poor little dear.

195
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:24,159
Petra, please.

196
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,536
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

197
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,997
I just want you
to listen to what I say

198
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:32,960
and not have a preconceived opinion.

199
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,711
Noted.

200
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:38,382
I can understand your bitterness.

201
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:43,011
Did <i>he</i> ask for the divorce?

202
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,722
No, I did.

203
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,975
Not him?

204
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,018
<i>YOU?</i>

205
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,771
Good heavens.

206
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,691
That surprises you, eh?

207
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,901
Poor little Petra,

208
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,903
who couldn't do without her husband,

209
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,155
hopelessly in love,

210
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,032
almost a slave.

211
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:06,994
And she asks for a divorce.

212
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,704
Terrible, isn't it?

213
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:10,414
Did he -

214
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,207
No.

215
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,877
He wasn't unfaithful.

216
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,924
Adultery wouldn't have been
a reason for me to separate.

217
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:24,052
For my part, the relationship
was a healthy one.

218
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:27,764
We both attached more importance
to pleasure than fidelity.

219
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:32,144
Fidelity as a duty, that is.

220
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,274
Mentally we were faithful
to each other, no doubt.

221
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:41,194
There were other reasons
why it didn't work out.

222
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:47,159
Of course, when things go wrong,
it turns to disgust and hatred.

223
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,788
But that had nothing to do
with what was going on around us

224
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:54,416
or with other people.

225
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,929
Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

226
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,891
Go on sketching. it's urgent.

227
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,548
Can we -

228
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:52,182
Marlene's been with me
for three years.

229
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,101
She hears everything,

230
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,645
sees everything,
knows everything.

231
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,272
Don't take any notice of Marlene.

232
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,483
Well, where were we?

233
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,693
What estranged you both?

234
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,987
What made you so sick?

235
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,033
You see, Petra,

236
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:12,494
Lester and I went through a time

237
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:15,664
when it looked as if
everything was over.

238
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,502
We were weary, disgusted and -

239
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,005
You have to be wise,

240
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:28,009
show understanding and humility.

241
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,513
A woman has her devices.
She just has to know how to use them.

242
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,558
I wasn't interested in “devices”,

243
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,394
especially not female ones.

244
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,646
I had no time for magic tricks.

245
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,607
- Tricks, Petra?
- Yes, they're tricks.

246
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,778
Cheating if you like.

247
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:51,491
They lead to a loss of freedom.

248
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,829
When I hear words like “humility” -

249
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:58,123
Don't sneer.

250
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,375
Don't sneer at me.

251
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:04,629
Lester and I are really happy now.

252
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,507
Humility paid off.

253
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:11,011
He thinks he's the boss.

254
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,263
I let him think so,

255
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:17,184
but in the end I get my way.

256
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,855
Listen, darling...

257
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,942
I know what you mean...

258
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:31,781
and it may be all very well
for you and Lester.

259
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,870
Maybe this sense of compulsion...

260
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:41,541
is just what you need.

261
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,548
But, you see...

262
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,219
Frank and I...

263
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:03,647
we wanted
to make our love beautiful.

264
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,069
And for us, “beautiful”...

265
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:14,824
meant always knowing
what was going on,

266
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,744
in yourself...

267
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,248
and in the other person.

268
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,880
We didn't want a humdrum marriage
with codes of behaviour.

269
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:38,348
We wanted to decide
everything anew,

270
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:43,937
always be alert...

271
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,526
always...

272
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,862
free.

273
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:57,075
I don't understand...

274
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:02,080
why everything must be so complicated
when it can be simple.

275
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:07,294
Codes of behaviour exist for us
to use them consciously.

276
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,422
Why keep having to
decide things anew

277
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,633
when we have
tried-and-trusted methods...

278
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,304
and they're good?

279
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,934
We wanted to be happy together.

280
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,520
You understand?

281
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:27,480
Together.

282
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:31,609
I don't know of any
tried-and-trusted model for that.

283
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,946
What turned it all into disgust

284
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,825
when there was so much clarity
and understanding?

285
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,745
Success, for example.

286
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,289
The success I had

287
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:47,334
and that Frank hoped for
and needed so much.

288
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,295
That's how it began.
it was as simple as that.

289
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,465
I'm sorry,
but success is no reason to -

290
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,342
Men...

291
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,680
and their vanity.

292
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:06,311
He wanted to pamper me,

293
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,896
take care of me.

294
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:11,191
Of course, he took me seriously

295
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,235
and respected my opinions.

296
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,029
But...

297
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,991
he wanted to be the breadwinner.

298
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:25,705
And that's how oppression
comes about, quite automatically.

299
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,708
It works like this:

300
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:33,088
I listen to you

301
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,548
and understand you.

302
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:38,468
But who slaves away
and earns the money?

303
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,221
One rule for him, another for me.

304
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,973
My dear...

305
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:48,228
at first, it was,

306
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:53,024
“Everything you earn, my girl,
will be put aside for later.

307
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:56,236
A home of our own,
a sports car.”

308
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,988
I agreed, because...

309
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:04,744
he was so loving, Sidonie.

310
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:10,917
And sometimes,
the love he lavished on me

311
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,004
just swept me away.

312
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:18,591
I was breathless for joy.

313
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:25,098
Then, when he struck a bad patch,

314
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:30,854
it was almost funny to see
how his ridiculous pride was wounded.

315
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,815
To be honest,

316
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:36,151
I actually enjoyed it.

317
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:39,487
Especially as I thought he knew
how ridiculous his behaviour was.

318
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,865
But he didn't.

319
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:47,745
And later,
when I tried to tell him

320
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:53,293
that it made no difference to me
whether a man was on top or not...

321
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,629
it was too late.

322
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:01,259
As soon as I broached the matter...

323
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,597
he was like a wall, Sidonie...

324
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:08,766
like a wall.

325
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:17,817
Gradually the honesty began to die.

326
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:31,998
I thought I'd been mistaken
about him or about myself.

327
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,959
So then I called it a day.

328
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,171
I stopped loving him.

329
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:43,343
The last six months were excruciating,

330
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:45,803
believe me, excruciating.

331
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,515
He realised it was all over.

332
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,517
He felt it at least.

333
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,810
But he refused to accept it.

334
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:55,980
And even then, he wasn't very bright.

335
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,816
He tried to hold onto his wife,

336
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,028
if not wholly,

337
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,864
at least in bed.

338
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,785
That's when it turned to disgust.

339
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:12,539
He tried a new technique:
violence.

340
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:15,792
I let him possess me. I bore it.

341
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,627
But...

342
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,215
the man seemed so filthy.

343
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,133


344
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:28,513
He stank.

345
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,974
He stank of man...

346
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,727
the way men stink.

347
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:38,314
What had once had its charms

348
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,525
now nauseated me,

349
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:43,069
brought tears to my eyes.

350
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,071
The way he took me.

351
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,406
Petra, please!

352
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,701
Hear the story out, will you?

353
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:54,163
He mounted me like a bull
mounting a cow.

354
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,542
Not the slightest respect anymore.

355
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,670
No thought of a woman's pleasure.

356
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:03,590
The pain, Sidonie.

357
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,592
The pain.

358
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:08,261
You can't imagine it.

359
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,556
And when I sometimes -

360
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,850
Oh, the shame of it.

361
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:19,105
I felt so humiliated.

362
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:26,237
He thought I was crying
for love and gratitude.

363
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,364
How stupid he was.

364
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,117
He was so dumb.

365
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,872
How stupid men are.

366
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,916
You poor thing.

367
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,713
How you must have suffered.

368
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,468
I don't need your pity.

369
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,764
He-

370
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,224
He deserved mine.

371
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,186
Understanding, kindness or pity,

372
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:00,688
if nothing else were possible.

373
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,815
He aroused no feelings in me.

374
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:06,444
On the contrary,
it became worse and worse.

375
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:11,741
When we dined together,

376
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:15,912
his chewing
sounded like an explosion.

377
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,456
I couldn't stand it
when he swallowed,

378
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,833
the way he cut his meat,
ate his vegetables,

379
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,794
held a cigarette,
a glass of whiskey.

380
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:25,421
Everything seemed so ridiculous,

381
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,840
so affected.

382
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,344
I felt ashamed for him.

383
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:36,099
I imagined everyone else
must see him the way I did.

384
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:43,481
Of course,
it was hysteria, panic.

385
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,860
There was nothing left to save.

386
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,197
All over.

387
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,241
Finished.

388
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,868
The end.

389
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,539
I'm so ashamed.

390
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,374
There's no need.

391
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:04,335
No need to be ashamed.

392
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:08,506
You've tried to learn,
tried to understand.

393
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:09,841
Whereas I -

394
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:15,471
I think people are made
to need each other.

395
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:22,186
But they haven't learned
to live together.

396
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,698
That must be Karin.

397
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:34,824


398
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,826
A delightful girl.

399
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:40,455
I met her on the boat
from Sydney to Southampton.

400
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:44,000
She wants to make a start
in Germany.

401
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:53,050


402
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:58,097
This is Petra Von Kant.

403
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:00,767
I told you so much about her.

404
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,688


405
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,109
Take a seat.

406
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,460
Please excuse the mess.

407
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,339
Things are a bit upside down.

408
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:34,050
It doesn't matter.

409
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:36,969
Some tea? Or a cognac?

410
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:40,306
A cognac, please.

411
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,976
Marlene, cognac.

412
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,898
And you, Sidonie?
- No, thanks.

413
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:51,567
Not this early.

414
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:53,319
Funny,

415
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:56,948
I imagined you much older,

416
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:00,576
more distinguished.

417
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,620
Is that the word?

418
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:09,502
That is the word, yes.

419
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,089
But why older?

420
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:18,761
People who are so successful,
so famous,

421
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,849
I don't know,
they're usually older.

422
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,310
It's the exception
that proves the rule.

423
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,444


424
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:36,946


425
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,593
It's time we were leaving, Karin.

426
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:04,015
I'll give you a call.
I'm in town longer this time.

427
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,851
Do that, Sidonie.

428
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,686
Take care.

429
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:17,820


430
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:25,077
You have a good figure.

431
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,996
You could use it to your advantage.

432
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,082
Get in touch with me some time.
- I'd love to.

433
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,501
Coming.

434
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:35,963
Let's say
tomorrow evening, at 8:00?

435
00:37:41,594 --> 00:37:43,179
See you tomorrow, then.

436
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:45,222
Yes, till tomorrow.

437
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:38,150
You've altered the sleeves?

438
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:42,363


439
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,366
that's good.

440
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,625
They'll like that better.

441
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:06,280
That was the bell, Marlene.

442
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:11,118
And I'm not ready yet.

443
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,423
Open the door.

444
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,641
<i>I'll</i> be down in a moment.

445
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,344


446
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:55,931
How nice.

447
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:02,021
Good evening, Mrs. Von Kant.

448
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,949
I've prepared a bite to eat.

449
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,368
Marlene, serve the food.

450
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:23,876
So here you are.
- Here I am.

451
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:28,839
Enjoying it here in Germany?

452
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:31,884
I was only away five years.

453
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,144
Yes, I'm enjoying it.

454
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,647
Nothing's changed much.

455
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,484
Things stay the way they are
in Germany.

456
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:51,028
Tell me about yourself.

457
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,780
Me?

458
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:55,241
There's nothing much to tell.

459
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,326
Oh, yes, there is.

460
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,328
What you think,

461
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:01,664
what you...

462
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:05,751
dream.

463
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:09,546
Nothing much.

464
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,007
I just want my little corner
in this world.

465
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:14,009
Is that asking too much?

466
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:18,264
On the contrary, Karin.

467
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:25,938
That's what we live for:

468
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:32,027
to fight for a place for ourselves.

469
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,616
Do we have to fight?

470
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:40,995
Of course.

471
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:45,666
I had to fight too, and hard.
Very hard.

472
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,294
That's life.

473
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:53,173
I always thought
I was too lazy to fight.

474
00:43:53,257 --> 00:43:55,884
- Too lazy?
- Yes.

475
00:43:56,844 --> 00:44:01,807
I prefer to lie in bed,
reading graphic novels.

476
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:10,357
Maybe you haven't found
the right incentive to live yet.

477
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:12,276
You're still young.

478
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,195
- Twenty-three.
- Exactly.

479
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:17,698
You've so much ahead of you,

480
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:21,035
good things,
bad, ugly and beautiful things.

481
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:24,079
Life begins at 23.

482
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:26,665
- Does it?

483
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,002
Don't you think so?

484
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,714
My God, I have so much
experience already.

485
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:34,923
I'm married and -

486
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:36,842
You are?

487
00:44:39,178 --> 00:44:41,722
Yes, my husband
stayed in Australia.

488
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:43,265
We had -

489
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:45,851
it's all so complicated.

490
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,854


491
00:44:49,855 --> 00:44:52,441
Nothing is simple.

492
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:55,235
Nothing at all.

493
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,741
You have to understand...

494
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:04,870
what humility is.

495
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:08,832
Humility?

496
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,503
You see,

497
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:15,881
everyone has his own theory
of the world.

498
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:18,300
I believe

499
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:25,307
you have to have humility
to be able to bear what you know.

500
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:29,645
I have humility in my work

501
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:33,899
or with respect to the money I earn

502
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,905
or the many things
that are stronger than me.

503
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,825
I think “humility”
is a strange word.

504
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:45,994
It reminds me of kneeling
and praying.

505
00:45:46,078 --> 00:45:48,122
I don't really know.

506
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:52,084
Perhaps these...

507
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:55,379
concepts

508
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:58,757
are not suitable for young people.

509
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,344
I'd have reacted
the same way at your age.

510
00:46:13,147 --> 00:46:15,274
Thank you.

511
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,776
Help yourself.

512
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:28,036
Do you think
you'd enjoy working as a model?

513
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:34,585
I don't know the trade
and what's involved, but why not?

514
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:38,422
Fine.
We must talk business.

515
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:41,592
You can't just go down the runway
and think you know everything.

516
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:44,928
You must be willing to learn.

517
00:46:45,012 --> 00:46:46,763
I am willing to learn.

518
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:48,182
I want nothing for free.

519
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:50,017
I could help you, of course.

520
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,103
Later on, when you know the ropes,

521
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:55,731
you'll easily find work.

522
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:58,484


523
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:06,366
You may have difficulties at first.

524
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,869
Financial difficulties, I mean.

525
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:10,871
You wouldn't earn anything
during training.

526
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:13,707
- I suppose not.
- I'll help you.

527
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,375
That's an offer.

528
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,753
Money shouldn't be an obstacle.

529
00:47:21,673 --> 00:47:23,675
That's very nice of you.

530
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:31,391
The nice thing about the job
is that you're often on the road.

531
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:34,436
I love big foreign cities at night.

532
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,772
Are you fond of travelling?

533
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:39,233
Depends. Yes, I think so.

534
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:41,318
It can be marvellous:

535
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:46,114
travel, new experiences,
foreign cities, music.

536
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:48,742
Do you like art?
- Art?

537
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:52,246
I don't know.
- Theatre, concerts, good movies?

538
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:55,832
Oh, yes,
I love the movies.

539
00:47:55,916 --> 00:48:00,212
Pictures about passion
and sorrow are nice.

540
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:07,219
We could learn together.

541
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:10,264
That makes it easier.

542
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,934
I was lucky to have parents

543
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:18,188
who pointed out to me at an early age
the beautiful things in life.

544
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:20,274
What were yours like?

545
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:22,776
My father was a toolmaker.

546
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,828
Very interesting.

547
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,959
We didn't have much.

548
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:43,505
Lots of work and not much fun.
That's how it was.

549
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:47,759
They didn't have a good life.

550
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,223
A tiny apartment,
three kids screaming all the time.

551
00:48:53,307 --> 00:48:58,270
But your parents devoted themselves
to you as a child, didn't they?

552
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,481
Devoted themselves to us?

553
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:04,818
We were in the way,
a nuisance most of the time.

554
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:08,530
Poor child,
it must have been dreadful.

555
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:10,449


556
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:13,535
They meant well.

557
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,664
Besides, they left us in peace.

558
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:25,964
It's better if parents don't interfere
with all the things you have in your head.

559
00:49:29,593 --> 00:49:33,597
Even so,
leaving children to their own devices?

560
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,182
I'm not so sure.

561
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,980
You know...

562
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:45,442
I have a daughter myself.

563
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:47,736
I don't always have time
to look after her

564
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:54,451
but I know she's at the best
boarding school there is.

565
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:57,329
It's a reassuring feeling.

566
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,881
I liked school.

567
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,677
Didn't you?

568
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,180
No, I don't think I did.

569
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:18,767
I know I was glad when it was over.

570
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,436
Although I was a fairly good student.

571
00:50:23,146 --> 00:50:26,608
I'm sure you're very intelligent.

572
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:28,443
Intelligent? Yes.

573
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:32,531
But I didn't like learning
in those days.

574
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:36,785
The things I was interested in,
I found easy.

575
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:39,788
It was the same with me.

576
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:44,918
I was unbeatable
at the things I liked.

577
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:50,632
Funnily enough,
I loved mathematics.

578
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:52,592
I didn't.

579
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:55,303
I was always bad at arithmetic.

580
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:59,474
It was okay at first, but later,
with those letters and so on,

581
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,184
I was lost.

582
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:03,395
Strange.

583
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:10,485
Algebra fascinated me tremendously.

584
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:12,779
Tremendously.

585
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:14,948
Algebra?

586
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:17,659
No, it wasn't for me.

587
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:20,454
Never could understand it.

588
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:22,998
Why stick a letter onto a number?

589
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,667
I still don't understand.

590
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:28,587
It's not important.

591
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,926
There are more important things
in the world.

592
00:51:36,303 --> 00:51:38,388
I loved gymnastics

593
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:41,266
and summer athletics...

594
00:51:42,434 --> 00:51:46,021
or games like handball.

595
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:50,442
I didn't like using
the exercise equipment.

596
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:54,529
I always had better grades
in the summer.

597
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:56,990
Did you?

598
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:02,996
No, I preferred the exercise equipment.

599
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,916
It requires...

600
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:09,169
discipline.

601
00:52:11,004 --> 00:52:15,550
Another of those words
young people hate, I suppose?

602
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:21,389
Discipline's fine
as long as you're having fun.

603
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:27,145
But discipline for its own sake
or compulsion,

604
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:28,897
I don't think that's good.

605
00:52:32,067 --> 00:52:34,194
It's funny, but...

606
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:40,534
I need a push to make me do things.

607
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:45,580
Like needing money,
or having to keep a promise.

608
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:49,501
If there were no compulsion...

609
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,171
I'd be totally lost at times.

610
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:55,882
Yes, I understand.

611
00:52:55,966 --> 00:52:58,844
But it's better
if you can do without it.

612
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:04,015
My father took us on a bike ride
every Sunday.

613
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:06,726
The whole family pedalled away.

614
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:10,605
Him in front, then Mother,

615
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:14,526
then us three girls behind.

616
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:22,075
He cycled like mad out in front.
He was a man.

617
00:53:22,534 --> 00:53:25,954
When we came home,
we were worn out,

618
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:28,331
and he was as fresh as a daisy.

619
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:32,711
Then he had a fight with Mother
about nothing every Sunday.

620
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:37,424
Anyway, we all had to come along.

621
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:42,387
Maybe I'd have chosen
to go along sometimes...

622
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:46,433
but it was never any fun that way.

623
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:52,397
The thought of it is amusing, though.

624
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:56,067
Father, mother,
and us three girls on our bikes.

625
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,778
<i>Isn't it?</i>

626
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:03,575
Why,yes.

627
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:09,456
It was brutal of your father.

628
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:14,669
But that's not
the sort of compulsion I mean.

629
00:54:14,753 --> 00:54:19,591
I'm talking about the constraints
people accept,

630
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:22,677
that they wish for and need.

631
00:54:25,388 --> 00:54:27,599
How are your parents?

632
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:34,940
They're both dead.

633
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:40,111
I'm so sorry for you.

634
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,447
Both of them?

635
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:48,828
Father beat Mother to death,
then hung himself.

636
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:53,124
No. How terrible!

637
00:54:55,210 --> 00:55:00,131
Now you see me
in a different light.

638
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:02,676
It's always the same.

639
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:08,890
People like me
until they hear my story.

640
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:10,642
Then it's all over.

641
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:29,077
No, Karin. On the contrary.

642
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:35,041
I feel a great affection for you.

643
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:42,007
Even greater now
that I've heard your story.

644
00:55:43,633 --> 00:55:46,845
We have to do
something good for you.

645
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:52,684
Let's be real friends.

646
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:55,145
Sure. It makes things easier.

647
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:02,193
A bottle of sparkling wine!

648
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,286
She's a good girl.

649
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,538
She does all my work for me.

650
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:25,508
But tell me,
how did it happen?

651
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:27,677
My parents, you mean?

652
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:29,763
Quite simply.

653
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:33,058
Didn't you read about it
in the papers?

654
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:36,978
No, I can't remember.

655
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:42,734
Dad drank like a fish, and -

656
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:47,572
No, it wasn't like that, because -

657
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:51,826
One day his firm told him,

658
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:54,162
“Thimm, we're a competitive firm,

659
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:58,917
and there's no room
for people of your age.”

660
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:03,213
I'm not sure exactly.

661
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:07,092
I wasn't there,
but it was something like that.

662
00:57:09,803 --> 00:57:15,141
He broke down, cried
and began to thrash around.

663
00:57:15,225 --> 00:57:19,687
Somebody from security came
and threw him out.

664
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:28,363
He went to his regular bar
and got drunk.

665
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:32,283
What else could he do?

666
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,954
Dad always drank heavily.

667
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:42,669
Then he went home,

668
00:57:44,796 --> 00:57:49,676
beat Mother to death and hung himself.

669
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:55,306
He saw no future for himself
and his wife.

670
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:58,059
It's as simple as that.

671
00:58:00,812 --> 00:58:04,399
I went off to Australia, but...

672
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:08,862
things are not so rosy there either.

673
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:14,909
You don't get anywhere
without pushing.

674
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:22,917
All that's going to change, Karin.

675
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:31,092
We're both going to do our best
to make something out of your life.

676
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:36,181
Wouldn't that be great?

677
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:41,519
I've often given up hope.

678
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,857
I had a bellyful with my husband.

679
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:52,113
He had me slaving away,
saying he would make a pile of money.

680
00:58:52,197 --> 00:58:54,782
He said it was only a matter of time.

681
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:59,954
He got on my damned nerves.

682
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:02,141


683
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:12,110


684
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:15,738
Here's to us.

685
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:19,367
May we use our opportunities.

686
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:46,686
I can see you now,

687
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:49,314
striding down the runway.

688
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:53,234
I'll design a collection
especially for you.

689
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:56,070
<i>I'll</i> make a top model out of you.

690
01:00:57,488 --> 01:01:00,491
You're beautiful, Karin.

691
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:39,697
Do you like this kind of music?

692
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:48,081
They're records from my youth.

693
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:51,918
They either make me sad

694
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:53,669
or really happy.

695
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:56,130
It depends.

696
01:01:58,383 --> 01:02:02,470
They're from the time
I was with my first husband.

697
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:07,934
What a romance that was.

698
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:14,357
Someone once said
beautiful things don't last long.

699
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,237
And, you know,
there's some truth in that.

700
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:24,325
Pierre was killed in an accident.

701
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:27,578
He was a passionate driver.

702
01:02:28,538 --> 01:02:30,456
Pierre was...

703
01:02:31,374 --> 01:02:33,960
He was a handsome man...

704
01:02:35,211 --> 01:02:37,839
but obsessed.

705
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:42,844
He thought he was immortal.

706
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:46,889
But he wasn't.

707
01:02:46,973 --> 01:02:51,144
He'd been dead four months
when our daughter was born.

708
01:02:51,227 --> 01:02:53,771
It wasn't easy for me.

709
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,694
But everything is predestined in life.

710
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:02,822
I had to put up with it.

711
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:08,786
People are terrible, Karin.

712
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:13,040
They can bear anything.

713
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:19,297
People are hard and brutal.

714
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,967
Everyone is replaceable.

715
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:25,178
Everyone.

716
01:03:26,262 --> 01:03:28,973
That's something
they have to learn.

717
01:04:01,797 --> 01:04:05,009
Where are you staying?
- At the Hotel Übersee.

718
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:06,969
In a hotel?

719
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:08,596
That must be expensive.

720
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:11,766
- 27 marks, including breakfast.
- Exactly.

721
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:14,852
Who can afford that for long?

722
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:19,857
You can move in with me.

723
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:22,944
It's cheaper and -

724
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:32,203
Anyway it's nicer.

725
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:36,624
<i>- I</i> -
- You don't want to?

726
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,751
I'd love to.

727
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:41,212
I simply meant -

728
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:45,591
Maybe I'll get on your nerves.

729
01:04:45,675 --> 01:04:48,302
I know myself, Karin.

730
01:04:48,386 --> 01:04:50,805
You won't get on my nerves.

731
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,807
I know what I'm like.

732
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:56,978
I'm often very lonely.

733
01:04:58,187 --> 01:05:00,731
We'll make it cosy for ourselves.

734
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:03,651
If you think so...

735
01:05:05,111 --> 01:05:07,697
Yes, I'd love to.

736
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,116
I love you.

737
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:14,453
I love you, Karin.

738
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:18,749
I love you.

739
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:24,005
We shall conquer the world together.

740
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:28,759
I want to caress you,
kiss you.

741
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:32,221
I like you too, Petra.
Very much.

742
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:36,183
But give me time. Please.

743
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:38,227
I'll give you time.

744
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:40,146
We have time enough.

745
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:42,857
We have so much time.

746
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:46,110
Time to get to know each other.

747
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:49,447
We shall love each other.

748
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:55,119
Bring us the sparkling wine.

749
01:06:19,435 --> 01:06:21,854
Did you cancel the flight?

750
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:22,938
What?

751
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:26,150
Did you cancel the flight?

752
01:06:26,817 --> 01:06:29,403
Why? Sorry, I'm still in bed.

753
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:31,947
I'll do it myself.

754
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:33,741
No, I'll do it. Let me get up.

755
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:37,328
No, why shouldn't I do it?

756
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:52,802
I booked two seats to Madrid
on the 25th.

757
01:06:52,885 --> 01:06:55,429
For Kant and Thimm.

758
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,808


759
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:02,019
I'm afraid I have to cancel them.

760
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:04,772
No, not just now.

761
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:07,024


762
01:07:08,526 --> 01:07:10,945
It's pointless cancelling flight tickets.

763
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:14,949
Either you turn up or you don't.
They notice in time.

764
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:17,618
It's a matter of courtesy, darling.

765
01:07:17,702 --> 01:07:19,995
You'll learn that some day.

766
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,873
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

767
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,965
My Shoes!

768
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:49,442
Hurry up!

769
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:57,491
I'm beginning to think
she's unhinged.

770
01:07:57,575 --> 01:08:01,036
She's not unhinged.
She loves me.

771
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,415
- Well, have fun.
- Thank you.

772
01:08:36,614 --> 01:08:40,284
You're not going back to school?
Is that final?

773
01:08:40,785 --> 01:08:43,746
Why should I?
I won't learn anything.

774
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:47,166
We never stop learning.

775
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,546
- You and your pearls of wisdom.
- it's just experience.

776
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:55,549
Let me phone them
and apologise on your behalf.

777
01:08:55,633 --> 01:08:58,010
Then you can go back.

778
01:08:58,344 --> 01:09:02,515
It's worth finishing something
you've started.

779
01:09:02,598 --> 01:09:05,643
It always pays off.

780
01:09:05,935 --> 01:09:08,687
- If you think so.

781
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:10,231
I do.

782
01:09:10,314 --> 01:09:13,567
- Fine.
- Exactly.

783
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:17,905
Fix me a gin and tonic.

784
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:37,842
You drink too much.

785
01:09:39,385 --> 01:09:42,263
Be careful you don't put on weight.

786
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:44,849
Go to hell.

787
01:09:46,016 --> 01:09:51,063
Don't forget,
your figure is your fortune.

788
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:59,238
It's all you have.

789
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:02,116
- If you think so.
- I don't think so. I know so.

790
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:04,451


791
01:10:19,884 --> 01:10:22,177
I love you.
- I do too.

792
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:26,390
Shit! “I do too. I do too.”

793
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:30,227
Say, “I love you.”

794
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,230


795
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:36,859
Alright, I like you.

796
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:39,570
I love you.

797
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,913
You have the loveliest skin
in the world.

798
01:10:50,789 --> 01:10:52,583
Do I?

799
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,085


800
01:10:56,962 --> 01:10:59,214
And the loveliest hair.

801
01:10:59,298 --> 01:11:01,884
The loveliest shoulders.

802
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:04,929
And the loveliest eyes.

803
01:11:07,139 --> 01:11:09,266
I love you.

804
01:11:11,143 --> 01:11:12,978


805
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:24,990
Leave me alone.

806
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:28,035
But Why?

807
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,329
I haven't cleaned my teeth yet.

808
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:32,873
I don't mind.

809
01:11:32,957 --> 01:11:35,292
But I do.

810
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,045
Stop it.

811
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:40,339
I want to read.

812
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:42,132
Please.

813
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:53,852
I'll leave you in peace
if it disgusts you.

814
01:11:53,936 --> 01:11:56,188
It doesn't disgust me.

815
01:11:56,855 --> 01:12:00,818
We can't play with each other
24 hours a day.

816
01:12:01,819 --> 01:12:03,821
We can.

817
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:06,407
Oh, Petra.

818
01:12:07,825 --> 01:12:10,744
I could remain forever
in your embrace.

819
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:14,915
Why do you have to be so cruel?
I haven't done a thing to you.

820
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:17,251
I'm trying hard.

821
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:20,087
I'm not being cruel.

822
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:22,131
That's easily said.

823
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:24,883
You say you're not cruel,

824
01:12:24,967 --> 01:12:27,886
but when I need you,
you push me away.

825
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:33,183


826
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:36,020


827
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:39,064
May I-

828
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:43,694
I just want
to sit with you for a while.

829
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:55,456
Where were you last night?

830
01:13:02,171 --> 01:13:04,923
Where were you last night?

831
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:06,633
I went dancing.

832
01:13:06,717 --> 01:13:08,969
Till six in the morning?

833
01:13:09,053 --> 01:13:12,765
- What about it?
- They're not open that late.

834
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:16,101


835
01:13:17,728 --> 01:13:21,648
Who did you go “dancing” with?

836
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:24,485
What?

837
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:28,906
Tell me who you went dancing with.

838
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:31,200
With a man.

839
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:33,410


840
01:13:34,036 --> 01:13:35,871


841
01:13:35,954 --> 01:13:37,247
What man?

842
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:43,796
A big black man
with a big black cock.

843
01:13:47,091 --> 01:13:49,259
I see.

844
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:14,868
Want another one?
- Yes, make me another one.

845
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:17,996
“Please.”

846
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:22,084
Forget it.

847
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:25,462
No, I won't forget it.

848
01:14:26,922 --> 01:14:29,842
But you could be a little more kind.

849
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:39,226
Here.

850
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:42,855
Thank you, dearest.

851
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:50,571
What was he like?

852
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:52,114
In bed?

853
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:54,408
For instance.

854
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:57,786
Insatiable.

855
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,872


856
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:05,043
Extremely.

857
01:15:05,127 --> 01:15:09,673
Just imagine his big black hands
on my white skin.

858
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,426
And those lips.

859
01:15:12,509 --> 01:15:15,512
You know, those blacks
all have big, warm lips.

860
01:15:23,562 --> 01:15:26,106
Don't faint, darling.

861
01:15:28,025 --> 01:15:32,029
Stop staring, you silly cow!
Bring me the newspapers!

862
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:38,702
No need to get hysterical.
The best is still to come.

863
01:15:41,413 --> 01:15:43,040
Don't be so mean.

864
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:46,960
I'm not being mean.
I'm telling the truth.

865
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:50,881
We always said we wanted
to be frank with each other.

866
01:15:51,506 --> 01:15:53,800
But you can't stand it.

867
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:56,386
You want to be told lies.

868
01:16:00,265 --> 01:16:02,059


869
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,895
Lie to me.

870
01:16:05,896 --> 01:16:08,148
Please, lie to me.

871
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:20,160
All right, it isn't true.

872
01:16:21,078 --> 01:16:26,250
I was walking alone all night,
thinking about us.

873
01:16:28,418 --> 01:16:30,420
Really?

874
01:16:32,589 --> 01:16:34,675
That can't be true.

875
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:37,928
Of course not.

876
01:16:38,303 --> 01:16:41,014
<i>I did</i> sleep with a man.

877
01:16:41,098 --> 01:16:43,600
But that's not important, is it?

878
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:46,311


879
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:48,939
Of course not.

880
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:51,358
But...

881
01:16:54,403 --> 01:16:57,114
I don't understand.

882
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:00,492
Really.

883
01:17:01,785 --> 01:17:04,621
I don't understand.

884
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,961
Why?

885
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,176
Why?

886
01:17:33,317 --> 01:17:35,694
Don't cry, Petra.

887
01:17:37,863 --> 01:17:41,742
Listen, I like you.
I love you, but -

888
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:45,579
it's obvious.

889
01:17:45,662 --> 01:17:48,290
I need a man from time to time.

890
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:50,834
That's the way I am.

891
01:17:53,337 --> 01:17:55,839
It doesn't affect us.

892
01:17:56,465 --> 01:17:58,550
I just use men, that's all.

893
01:17:58,633 --> 01:18:02,929
That's all there is to it.
Just a bit of fun.

894
01:18:06,058 --> 01:18:09,353
You were always talking of liberty.

895
01:18:10,562 --> 01:18:14,858
You always said,
“No obligations towards each other.”

896
01:18:18,028 --> 01:18:20,197
Don't cry.

897
01:18:22,032 --> 01:18:25,243
I always come back to you.

898
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:30,749
How my heart aches!

899
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:34,544
As if someone
had stabbed it with a knife.

900
01:18:36,171 --> 01:18:38,757
No need for it aching.

901
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,884
That won't help.

902
01:18:43,178 --> 01:18:45,430
No need for it <i>to</i> ache.

903
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:51,395
He who uses “need” without a “to”
need not use “need” at all.

904
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:59,361
I know I'm not as clever as you.

905
01:18:59,444 --> 01:19:01,321
I know that.

906
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:03,156
You're lovely.

907
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,784
I'm so fond of you.

908
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:09,287
Everything aches with love for you.

909
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:34,855
Want another one?

910
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:38,483
I must watch my figure.

911
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:08,889
- Will you be seeing him again?
- Who? That man?

912
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:12,225
- Are there so many?
- Come on.

913
01:20:12,309 --> 01:20:13,477
Well?

914
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:18,064
No, I'm not seeing him again.

915
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:20,817
I don't even know his name.

916
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:26,490
Besides,
he said he's being transferred.

917
01:20:27,491 --> 01:20:29,576
Really a black?

918
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:32,829
Yes. Why?

919
01:20:33,371 --> 01:20:35,040
Just because.

920
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,503
He was really great.

921
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:42,255
You'd have liked him.

922
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:47,427
He wasn't really black,
more brown...

923
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:51,681
with an intelligent face.

924
01:20:52,307 --> 01:20:56,269
Some blacks have European faces,
don't they?

925
01:20:58,355 --> 01:21:01,775
- I wouldn't know.
- They do.

926
01:21:02,192 --> 01:21:04,402
And he was one.

927
01:21:05,362 --> 01:21:08,448
He told me lovely things
about America.

928
01:21:08,532 --> 01:21:10,700
Karin, please.

929
01:21:13,044 --> 01:21:14,838
I'll shut up.

930
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:17,958
I thought we'd sorted things out.

931
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:21,294
You don't have to rave about him.

932
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:33,723
You're hitting the bottle too.

933
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:36,851
What else do I have?

934
01:21:37,143 --> 01:21:40,272
Come off it.

935
01:21:40,355 --> 01:21:42,941
You're getting hysterical.

936
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:45,110
I'm not hysterical.

937
01:21:45,193 --> 01:21:47,070
I'm suffering.

938
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,451
You thrive on suffering.

939
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:57,497
It's easy for you to talk.

940
01:21:57,581 --> 01:22:00,375
“People thrive on suffering.”

941
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,335
It's true.

942
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:05,964
I'd rather be happy, Karin.

943
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:08,091
I'd much rather be happy.

944
01:22:09,593 --> 01:22:11,511
All this makes me sick.

945
01:22:11,595 --> 01:22:13,722
What does?

946
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:16,516
Forget it.

947
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,311
Tell me what makes you sick.

948
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,689
You.

949
01:22:22,772 --> 01:22:25,358
You make me sick.

950
01:22:25,442 --> 01:22:28,486
Because I don't know
why you stay with me.

951
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:32,490
Whether it's my money, or because
you have a better chance with me...

952
01:22:35,452 --> 01:22:37,954
or because you love me.

953
01:22:38,455 --> 01:22:41,166
Because I love you, of course.

954
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,293
Shit.

955
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:45,128
Stop it.

956
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:48,882
- If you won't believe me -
- Believe you?

957
01:22:48,965 --> 01:22:53,595
It has nothing to do with believing you.
Of course I believe you love me.

958
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:57,057
But I don't know.

959
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,309
I really don't know.

960
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:03,313
That's what's making me sick.

961
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:22,832
Listen.

962
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:26,836
“An outstanding contribution
to next winter's fashion line-up

963
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,965
was made by Petra Von Kant
with her new creations.”

964
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:34,386
And there's a picture of you.

965
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:36,388
Show me.

966
01:23:38,765 --> 01:23:40,475
There.

967
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:48,191
Crazy.

968
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:51,986
Not bad.

969
01:23:52,904 --> 01:23:54,906
Tell me.

970
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:57,951
Yes, very nice.

971
01:23:58,034 --> 01:23:59,786
“Very nice, very nice.”

972
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:02,664
it's fabulous.

973
01:24:04,207 --> 01:24:07,585
The first time
my picture's been in the papers.

974
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:10,296
I don't believe it.

975
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,382
I love you.

976
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:15,218
Come here.

977
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:17,387
Forget it.

978
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:29,524
I'll take it.

979
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:33,611
Von Kant here.

980
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:40,952
It's for you from Zurich.

981
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:43,621


982
01:24:44,873 --> 01:24:48,084
- Who do you know in Zurich?
- No idea.

983
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:51,963
Karin Thimm speaking.

984
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:53,798
Who?

985
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:57,594


986
01:24:59,763 --> 01:25:02,015
What are you doing in Zurich?

987
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:04,768
What brings you to Zurich?

988
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:06,603
When?

989
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:08,688
3pm in Frankfurt?

990
01:25:08,772 --> 01:25:10,607
<i>Hold on I'll ask.</i>

991
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:13,359
When's the next flight to Frankfurt?

992
01:25:13,443 --> 01:25:15,445
<i>2.30 </i>

993
01:25:20,283 --> 01:25:22,994
The next flight from Bremen's at 2:30.

994
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:27,123
I'll try to get a seat.
If not, call me from Frankfurt.

995
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,337
I love you.

996
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:38,009
That was my husband.

997
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:40,136
Freddy's in Zurich.

998
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,139
He's in Europe.

999
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:48,478
Book me a flight to Frankfurt, please.

1000
01:25:49,604 --> 01:25:51,147
Be a dear.

1001
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:53,274


1002
01:26:18,216 --> 01:26:20,426


1003
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,554
Petra Von Kant speaking.

1004
01:26:22,637 --> 01:26:27,141
I'd like to book a seat
on the <i>2:25</i> flight to Frankfurt.

1005
01:26:30,186 --> 01:26:32,063
It's full?

1006
01:26:32,146 --> 01:26:33,648


1007
01:26:34,524 --> 01:26:37,443
There's room in first class?

1008
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:40,238
Fine.

1009
01:26:40,321 --> 01:26:45,201
Book the ticket
in the name of Karin Thimm.

1010
01:26:46,661 --> 01:26:48,329
I don't believe it.

1011
01:26:48,872 --> 01:26:49,998
Freddy's here.

1012
01:26:50,081 --> 01:26:52,792
Forty-five minutes before take-off, I know.

1013
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:55,044
I don't believe it.

1014
01:27:16,816 --> 01:27:21,571
You told me
you and your husband -

1015
01:27:22,196 --> 01:27:24,908
I thought you were through.

1016
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:27,869
That was ages ago.

1017
01:27:28,912 --> 01:27:33,917
You might at least
have told me...

1018
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:37,503
you were in touch again.

1019
01:27:37,587 --> 01:27:39,839
Freddy's my husband.

1020
01:27:39,923 --> 01:27:42,258
Of course I've written to him.

1021
01:27:43,176 --> 01:27:46,346
You said you wanted a divorce.

1022
01:27:46,846 --> 01:27:50,850
I said maybe we'd divorce one day.

1023
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:54,562
Anyone can change their mind
in six months.

1024
01:27:55,897 --> 01:27:57,732
You know what you are?

1025
01:27:57,815 --> 01:28:01,778
No, but I'm sure you'll tell me.

1026
01:28:02,445 --> 01:28:07,367
You're a rotten little whore.

1027
01:28:08,034 --> 01:28:10,286
Mean and rotten.

1028
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:13,748
You think so?

1029
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:16,626
Yes, I do.

1030
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:22,799
A nasty little creature.

1031
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:28,012
When I look at you I could throw up.

1032
01:28:28,096 --> 01:28:30,890
You'll be glad I'm leaving, then.

1033
01:28:30,974 --> 01:28:32,934
I am.

1034
01:28:33,017 --> 01:28:35,561
But it's almost too late.

1035
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:39,482
I wonder why you didn't
work the streets from the beginning.

1036
01:28:40,858 --> 01:28:44,070
It was less strenuous with you, darling.

1037
01:28:50,535 --> 01:28:54,956
Yes, I see.

1038
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:59,002
My God, how mean you are.

1039
01:29:00,003 --> 01:29:04,007
How can you deceive
someone like that,

1040
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:07,135
when you know they love you?

1041
01:29:07,218 --> 01:29:10,013
I didn't deceive you, Petra.

1042
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:13,850
Oh, yes, you lied to me.

1043
01:29:14,726 --> 01:29:18,062
You weren't straight with me.

1044
01:29:18,146 --> 01:29:20,148
That's enough.

1045
01:29:23,985 --> 01:29:26,529
I said I love you, Petra.

1046
01:29:27,488 --> 01:29:29,699
That wasn't a lie.

1047
01:29:30,908 --> 01:29:32,535
I love you...

1048
01:29:34,078 --> 01:29:36,622
in my own way.

1049
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:39,542
You must admit that.

1050
01:29:40,126 --> 01:29:46,049
I'd have reacted
quite differently if you -

1051
01:29:48,593 --> 01:29:51,888
How can anyone be so mean?

1052
01:29:52,889 --> 01:29:55,558
You knew how I felt,

1053
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,560
what happened to me.

1054
01:29:58,436 --> 01:30:00,730
That's not true.

1055
01:30:01,314 --> 01:30:05,193
I didn't know what had “happened”
to you for a long time.

1056
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:09,238
At first, you behaved
as if it were just fun.

1057
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:54,075
I can't help loving you.

1058
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:56,619
I can't help it.

1059
01:30:57,078 --> 01:31:01,040
I need you. I need you so much.

1060
01:31:01,124 --> 01:31:03,626
I'd do anything for you.

1061
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,170
I want to exist only for you.

1062
01:31:06,254 --> 01:31:08,631
You're all I have.

1063
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:16,222
I'm so alone without you,

1064
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,142
so very lonely.

1065
01:31:20,393 --> 01:31:23,229
Lonely, without a whore?

1066
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:26,149
Forgive me, please!

1067
01:31:26,232 --> 01:31:28,359
Try to understand
what's happening to me.

1068
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:30,903
Don't be so cruel.

1069
01:31:30,987 --> 01:31:33,322
Get up. I'm in a hurry.

1070
01:31:36,784 --> 01:31:41,164
Oh, you rotten little rat!

1071
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:01,934
You'll pay for that.

1072
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:06,522
You won't forget that, ever.

1073
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:14,614
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1074
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:16,949
Please understand.

1075
01:32:17,617 --> 01:32:19,827
Give me some money.

1076
01:32:19,911 --> 01:32:22,872
For the plane and for Frankfurt.

1077
01:32:22,955 --> 01:32:25,041
Freddy never has any money.

1078
01:32:31,339 --> 01:32:33,216


1079
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:36,594
I'm good enough for that.

1080
01:32:36,677 --> 01:32:38,721
For paying-

1081
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:41,390
Oh, my God.

1082
01:32:45,519 --> 01:32:47,897
How much?

1083
01:32:48,314 --> 01:32:50,066
Come on.

1084
01:32:50,942 --> 01:32:52,818
500.

1085
01:33:11,212 --> 01:33:13,589
<i>I'll</i> give <i>you 1,000...</i>

1086
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:16,842
so you won't be short.

1087
01:33:16,926 --> 01:33:19,387
500 is enough. Really.

1088
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:22,056
Take the thousand.

1089
01:33:23,015 --> 01:33:25,601
What does it matter now?

1090
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:31,524
Drive her to the airport.

1091
01:33:31,857 --> 01:33:34,402
I'm too drunk.

1092
01:33:57,049 --> 01:33:59,468
You're really leaving me?

1093
01:34:04,098 --> 01:34:05,599


1094
01:34:59,153 --> 01:35:02,865
No, this isn't Von Kant.

1095
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:14,502


1096
01:35:15,628 --> 01:35:17,546


1097
01:35:27,098 --> 01:35:31,060
I hate you.

1098
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:35,398
I hate you! I hate you!

1099
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:51,956
If only I could die.

1100
01:35:52,039 --> 01:35:54,417
Simply be gone.

1101
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,294
I can't bear the pain.

1102
01:35:57,378 --> 01:36:00,923
I can't go on.

1103
01:36:02,675 --> 01:36:06,846
Oh, God, what a bitch!

1104
01:36:06,929 --> 01:36:11,434
The rotten little bitch!

1105
01:36:12,226 --> 01:36:15,062
I'll show you one day.

1106
01:36:15,146 --> 01:36:19,150
I'll make you suffer.

1107
01:36:19,233 --> 01:36:23,320
You'll come crawling back to me,
you little whore!

1108
01:36:23,404 --> 01:36:27,783
<i>You'll kiss my feet!</i>

1109
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:34,623
I'm so mixed up.

1110
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:39,503
My God,
what did I do to deserve this?

1111
01:36:39,587 --> 01:36:41,797
What did I do?

1112
01:36:49,722 --> 01:36:52,975
I still love you.

1113
01:36:53,058 --> 01:36:57,104
Don't be so cruel, Karin.

1114
01:36:58,355 --> 01:37:02,610
Oh, shit.
I need you so much.

1115
01:37:04,153 --> 01:37:08,157
Phone me, at least.
Phone me, please.

1116
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:10,784
Just let me hear your voice.

1117
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:13,829
That's not asking too much.
Just phone me.

1118
01:37:13,913 --> 01:37:16,832
That doesn't cost you anything.

1119
01:37:25,174 --> 01:37:29,720
No, the bitch wouldn't dream of it.

1120
01:37:29,803 --> 01:37:32,598
She has it all worked out.

1121
01:37:35,643 --> 01:37:38,354
She just makes me wait because -

1122
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:43,234
it's so sordid.

1123
01:37:43,317 --> 01:37:48,656
You nauseate me.
A dirty little slut.

1124
01:37:48,739 --> 01:37:51,617
And I love you so much.
I'm mad about you.

1125
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:54,787
If only you knew how it hurts.

1126
01:37:55,412 --> 01:37:59,208
I hope you'll feel the same one day,

1127
01:37:59,291 --> 01:38:02,294
feel all washed up.

1128
01:38:02,378 --> 01:38:05,214
<i>It'll</i> look different then.

1129
01:38:05,631 --> 01:38:08,884
You're so damned stupid.

1130
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:12,972
It could be so lovely,
just the two of us.

1131
01:38:14,306 --> 01:38:17,768
You'll understand one day.

1132
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:21,272
But it'll be too late then.

1133
01:38:21,355 --> 01:38:24,525
Much too late.

1134
01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:27,486
Believe me <i>I'll</i> show you -

1135
01:38:35,578 --> 01:38:38,914
Happy birthday, Mother,

1136
01:38:38,998 --> 01:38:41,917
Gaby!

1137
01:38:47,172 --> 01:38:50,426
- Isn't Grandmother here yet?

1138
01:38:50,509 --> 01:38:52,595
I've so much to tell you.

1139
01:38:52,678 --> 01:38:55,931
Of course, my child.

1140
01:38:57,057 --> 01:38:59,768
Marlene, make tea for us.

1141
01:39:05,274 --> 01:39:07,985
What a flight.

1142
01:39:08,068 --> 01:39:11,280
It was so bumpy I felt sick.

1143
01:39:11,864 --> 01:39:16,493
Mother, it's ages since I saw you.

1144
01:39:16,577 --> 01:39:19,121
Dearest Mother.

1145
01:39:19,622 --> 01:39:21,790
Four months.

1146
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:24,835
Isn't Karin here?

1147
01:39:26,462 --> 01:39:27,963


1148
01:39:29,632 --> 01:39:32,134
But she's coming later?

1149
01:39:32,968 --> 01:39:35,304
I don't think so.

1150
01:39:35,387 --> 01:39:37,014
Doesn't matter.

1151
01:39:37,097 --> 01:39:39,767
I didn't like her particularly.

1152
01:39:41,143 --> 01:39:43,062


1153
01:39:43,145 --> 01:39:45,189
Well, you know,

1154
01:39:45,272 --> 01:39:49,693
she's rather common, isn't she?

1155
01:39:54,114 --> 01:39:57,034
No, she's not.

1156
01:39:57,493 --> 01:39:59,620
It's not important anyway.

1157
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:09,505
Mother, I'm so unhappy.

1158
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:12,841
Unhappy?

1159
01:40:14,301 --> 01:40:15,886


1160
01:40:17,012 --> 01:40:19,723
Actually, I'm terribly happy.

1161
01:40:21,183 --> 01:40:23,310
I don't know.

1162
01:40:23,769 --> 01:40:26,397
It's all so difficult.

1163
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,525
What is, my child?

1164
01:40:29,983 --> 01:40:34,321
Mother, I'm in love.

1165
01:40:34,697 --> 01:40:36,365
You're -

1166
01:40:38,951 --> 01:40:40,994
How funny.

1167
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:43,580
You, in love?

1168
01:40:45,165 --> 01:40:48,043
Your reaction is terrible.

1169
01:40:48,335 --> 01:40:50,379
Terribly bourgeois.

1170
01:40:50,462 --> 01:40:52,715
I'm sorry, my dear.

1171
01:40:53,465 --> 01:40:56,719
You were always my little girl.

1172
01:40:56,802 --> 01:41:00,222
I must get used to the fact
that you're growing up.

1173
01:41:00,305 --> 01:41:02,057
Please do.

1174
01:41:04,351 --> 01:41:08,188
Tell me about your boyfriend, Gaby.

1175
01:41:08,856 --> 01:41:11,442
That's just it, Mother.

1176
01:41:11,525 --> 01:41:14,069
He isn't my boyfriend yet.

1177
01:41:14,153 --> 01:41:17,072
He doesn't even know I love him.

1178
01:41:17,656 --> 01:41:20,576
He's so obstinate.

1179
01:41:20,659 --> 01:41:23,662
For three weeks,
I've been trying to flirt with him,

1180
01:41:23,746 --> 01:41:25,831
but he just snubs me,

1181
01:41:25,914 --> 01:41:28,625
behaves as if I don't exist.

1182
01:41:29,251 --> 01:41:31,837
It's so difficult.

1183
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,339
<i>It'll</i> work out, Gaby.

1184
01:41:34,423 --> 01:41:36,425
Believe me.

1185
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:40,763
He's so handsome.

1186
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:43,807
You've no idea how handsome he is.

1187
01:41:43,891 --> 01:41:45,434
Yes, I do.

1188
01:41:45,517 --> 01:41:49,021
He's very tall, slim,

1189
01:41:49,104 --> 01:41:51,857
has long fair hair

1190
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:54,693
and looks a bit like Mick Jagger.

1191
01:41:54,777 --> 01:41:57,237
How do you know?

1192
01:41:58,113 --> 01:41:59,531
I'm not saying-

1193
01:41:59,615 --> 01:42:02,159
You're so clever, Mother.

1194
01:42:02,242 --> 01:42:05,162
You're the cleverest mother
in the world.

1195
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:14,421
Who was it?

1196
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:18,884
What's the matter?
Say something.

1197
01:42:18,967 --> 01:42:20,886
Don't cry.

1198
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:22,721
What's happened?

1199
01:42:22,805 --> 01:42:24,139
Nothing, Gaby.

1200
01:42:24,223 --> 01:42:26,725
Nothing's happened.

1201
01:42:26,809 --> 01:42:28,060
Stop crying-

1202
01:42:28,143 --> 01:42:30,771
There's nothing wrong at all.

1203
01:42:39,822 --> 01:42:44,034
Get the cake and cream.

1204
01:42:45,953 --> 01:42:48,205
Get the hell out of here

1205
01:42:48,288 --> 01:42:50,374
and get the cake and cream!

1206
01:42:50,457 --> 01:42:52,084
Or are you deaf?

1207
01:42:52,167 --> 01:42:54,628
Get lost!

1208
01:43:03,846 --> 01:43:07,266
Why do you treat her so badly?

1209
01:43:07,349 --> 01:43:09,893
She doesn't deserve any better...

1210
01:43:10,978 --> 01:43:13,355
and she likes it that way.

1211
01:43:13,438 --> 01:43:16,233
She's happy like that, you see?
- No.

1212
01:43:16,316 --> 01:43:18,861
Whatever.

1213
01:43:18,944 --> 01:43:22,698
You don't have to worry
about servants.

1214
01:43:23,031 --> 01:43:26,451
I don't want to argue with you
on your birthday,

1215
01:43:26,535 --> 01:43:31,290
but I want you to know
I don't share your opinion at all.

1216
01:43:31,373 --> 01:43:32,791
That's fine.

1217
01:43:32,875 --> 01:43:35,085
Children have a right
to develop their own ideas.

1218
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:37,212
Isn't that what they say today?

1219
01:43:37,296 --> 01:43:39,381
<i>I'll go.</i>

1220
01:43:53,729 --> 01:43:57,399
May I announce
Baroness Sidonie Von Grasenabb.

1221
01:44:08,201 --> 01:44:10,078
My dear.

1222
01:44:17,836 --> 01:44:20,339
Happy birthday.

1223
01:44:20,422 --> 01:44:22,716
With all my heart, Petra.

1224
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:27,429
Open it later.

1225
01:44:28,263 --> 01:44:31,350
How's school, Gaby?
- Not bad, Aunt Sidonie.

1226
01:44:31,433 --> 01:44:33,477
Satisfactory is satisfactory,
I always say.

1227
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:37,189
Marlene, another cup, quickly.

1228
01:44:37,272 --> 01:44:40,317
- I think Mum treats Marlene badly.
- I don't think so.

1229
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:45,656
I don't think you're old enough
to judge your mother's actions.

1230
01:44:45,739 --> 01:44:48,200
Okay, then I won't say anything.

1231
01:44:48,283 --> 01:44:51,703
How are you, dearest?

1232
01:44:51,787 --> 01:44:54,289
What can I say?

1233
01:44:54,373 --> 01:44:55,916
I'm well.

1234
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:04,132
Pretty.
- isn't it?

1235
01:45:07,636 --> 01:45:09,304
Thanks.

1236
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:14,226
I read about your success in Milan.
Congratulations.

1237
01:45:14,309 --> 01:45:17,312
It's a pain in the backside.

1238
01:45:17,396 --> 01:45:18,897
- Stop laughing.
- Let her laugh.

1239
01:45:18,981 --> 01:45:20,232
Laugh, then.

1240
01:45:20,315 --> 01:45:22,359
I'm fed up with my work,

1241
01:45:22,442 --> 01:45:24,903
designing things and fearing
they won't succeed.

1242
01:45:24,987 --> 01:45:27,155
It's always the same, and for what?

1243
01:45:27,239 --> 01:45:29,074
You have to live.

1244
01:45:29,157 --> 01:45:33,203
You have to work to earn money.
And you need money to live.

1245
01:45:33,286 --> 01:45:36,665
That's just it. Money's everything.

1246
01:45:40,919 --> 01:45:43,338
The cake!

1247
01:45:49,511 --> 01:45:51,930
She's trying to annoy me.

1248
01:45:52,014 --> 01:45:53,765
I don't think so.

1249
01:45:53,849 --> 01:45:58,061
- If only she could.
- Don't talk like that.

1250
01:45:59,187 --> 01:46:03,025
Any news from Karin?

1251
01:46:03,817 --> 01:46:05,777
From Karin?

1252
01:46:05,861 --> 01:46:09,239
No, and you?

1253
01:46:09,322 --> 01:46:13,535
Yes, I know she's working for Pucci.

1254
01:46:13,994 --> 01:46:16,913
Oh, for Pucci?

1255
01:46:17,539 --> 01:46:21,877
She's very talented.
She'll go far, I'm sure.

1256
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,795
Talented?

1257
01:46:23,879 --> 01:46:26,048
That's not talent.

1258
01:46:26,131 --> 01:46:27,966
She just knows how to sell herself.

1259
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:31,470
Aren't you being unjust?

1260
01:46:31,553 --> 01:46:35,348
Maybe you're too subjective.

1261
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:38,268
She's in Bremen today.

1262
01:46:40,312 --> 01:46:41,730
She's -

1263
01:46:44,983 --> 01:46:49,196
You're really well informed, my dear.

1264
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:53,617
To tell the truth,
Karin phoned me this morning.

1265
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:56,328
Otherwise I wouldn't have known.
- Did you -

1266
01:46:56,411 --> 01:46:59,956
Naturally I told her
it was your birthday.

1267
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,918
She said she'd try to drop in.

1268
01:47:03,001 --> 01:47:07,506
But she wasn't sure.
She's terribly busy.

1269
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:14,262
She is terribly busy.

1270
01:47:16,765 --> 01:47:19,392


1271
01:47:20,769 --> 01:47:22,646
I know.

1272
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:38,120
You must get a hold of yourself, Petra.

1273
01:47:46,294 --> 01:47:49,256
It's so easy to go downhill.

1274
01:47:49,548 --> 01:47:51,424
<i>I'll go.</i>

1275
01:48:08,650 --> 01:48:11,736
So sorry,
I just couldn't find a taxi.

1276
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,488
Happy birthday.

1277
01:48:13,572 --> 01:48:15,699
Sidonie, you're looking younger
every day.

1278
01:48:15,782 --> 01:48:17,951
Really, Auntie?

1279
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:21,496
That comes from being happy.

1280
01:48:22,289 --> 01:48:25,876
The traffic in this town
will be the death of me.

1281
01:48:25,959 --> 01:48:29,045
How's school Gabriele?
- So, so.

1282
01:48:30,172 --> 01:48:33,216
- Have you been quarrelling?
- I was forbidden to talk.

1283
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,928
- That's not true, Gaby.
- I was forbidden to have an opinion.

1284
01:48:37,012 --> 01:48:39,598
Nobody forbade anything.
That's a lie.

1285
01:48:39,681 --> 01:48:43,185
- You forbade me to say anything.
- What a terrible child.

1286
01:48:43,268 --> 01:48:45,937
Calm down, children.

1287
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:48,565
Let's be nice to each other.

1288
01:48:54,446 --> 01:48:58,700
You make me sick, all of you.

1289
01:49:00,702 --> 01:49:03,914
- Well, really!
- Stay here, Sidonie.

1290
01:49:03,997 --> 01:49:05,123
What's wrong, my child?

1291
01:49:05,207 --> 01:49:09,878
You're all so fake.

1292
01:49:10,712 --> 01:49:14,674
Dishonest little rats.

1293
01:49:15,383 --> 01:49:17,385
You have no idea.

1294
01:49:19,387 --> 01:49:22,724
You revolting child.
I hate you. I hate you all!

1295
01:49:23,308 --> 01:49:25,060
Don't touch me!

1296
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:33,193
If you only knew
how filthy you are.

1297
01:49:35,362 --> 01:49:36,738


1298
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:44,746
A pack of parasites.

1299
01:49:45,622 --> 01:49:48,500
- What's the matter with her?
- Poor dear.

1300
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:51,670
I'm not poor.
I see you in a new light.

1301
01:49:51,753 --> 01:49:54,256
And what I see
makes me want to throw up!

1302
01:49:54,339 --> 01:49:57,342
Stop it!
You'll smash the whole house.

1303
01:49:57,425 --> 01:50:00,762
So what?
Did you work for it?

1304
01:50:00,845 --> 01:50:05,100
You've not done
a lick of work your whole life.

1305
01:50:05,183 --> 01:50:08,395
First you let father keep you,
then me.

1306
01:50:09,729 --> 01:50:12,190
Do you know what you are?

1307
01:50:12,274 --> 01:50:14,859
A whore, Mother.

1308
01:50:14,943 --> 01:50:19,072
A miserable little whore.

1309
01:50:27,205 --> 01:50:30,333
What I've earned,

1310
01:50:30,417 --> 01:50:32,377
I'll smash as much as I like.

1311
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:33,920
Do I make myself clear?

1312
01:50:40,802 --> 01:50:44,264
I don't understand a thing.

1313
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:47,517
What have we done?

1314
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,894
It's all because of that girl.

1315
01:50:49,978 --> 01:50:53,440
- What girl?
- Karin.

1316
01:50:55,734 --> 01:50:57,527
What about Karin?

1317
01:50:57,610 --> 01:51:00,488
Everyone knows
Petra is mad about Karin.

1318
01:51:03,908 --> 01:51:05,994
Mad?

1319
01:51:06,077 --> 01:51:08,496
I'm not mad.

1320
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,207
I love her.

1321
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:15,337
I love her as I've never loved
anything before.

1322
01:51:16,963 --> 01:51:19,049
You love her?

1323
01:51:19,132 --> 01:51:21,301
You love a girl?

1324
01:51:25,263 --> 01:51:31,436
Her little finger is worth more
than all of you together.

1325
01:51:31,519 --> 01:51:32,896
Mother, please!

1326
01:51:32,979 --> 01:51:34,522
Get lost, you little horror!

1327
01:51:34,606 --> 01:51:37,025
Marlene, gin!

1328
01:51:37,609 --> 01:51:39,277
Ten bottles of gin!

1329
01:51:39,361 --> 01:51:42,072
My daughter loves a girl.

1330
01:51:42,155 --> 01:51:43,990
How peculiar.

1331
01:51:44,574 --> 01:51:46,284
A girl.

1332
01:51:47,535 --> 01:51:49,454
My daughter.

1333
01:52:04,344 --> 01:52:05,804
Karin!

1334
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:12,644
No, I can't stand it anymore.

1335
01:52:13,978 --> 01:52:18,191
<i>I'll</i> smash everything. Everything!

1336
01:52:18,608 --> 01:52:21,027
We must calm her down.

1337
01:52:21,111 --> 01:52:24,155
What do you want?
You get a kick out of this.

1338
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,199
You have enough
to gossip about for a year.

1339
01:52:26,282 --> 01:52:28,410
Shut your mouth.

1340
01:52:28,910 --> 01:52:31,329
I feel so sick.

1341
01:52:31,413 --> 01:52:34,582
Oh God! Oh, God!

1342
01:52:34,666 --> 01:52:38,545
I'm going.
I don't have to put up with this.

1343
01:52:38,628 --> 01:52:40,130
Go then. Get lost!

1344
01:52:40,213 --> 01:52:42,006
Do you think I'm worried about you?

1345
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:46,052
I never want to see you again.
Never again, do you hear?

1346
01:52:46,136 --> 01:52:50,140
You'll pay for this, Petra.
You'll live to regret it.

1347
01:52:50,223 --> 01:52:53,601
I won't pay for anything.

1348
01:52:53,685 --> 01:52:56,521
I've paid for enough.

1349
01:52:57,814 --> 01:53:01,776
Anyone else leaving?

1350
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:03,987
The door's open.

1351
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:05,989
Get out!

1352
01:53:06,072 --> 01:53:10,118
Get it!
I don't want to see you again!

1353
01:53:10,493 --> 01:53:14,622
I've nothing left to give!
I'm all washed up!

1354
01:53:15,623 --> 01:53:19,210
Gin, Marlene, gin.

1355
01:53:20,378 --> 01:53:22,714
Or are you leaving too?

1356
01:53:24,174 --> 01:53:28,219
What are you all crying about?

1357
01:53:32,182 --> 01:53:35,101
You're all so happy.

1358
01:53:35,185 --> 01:53:38,396
Everyone's happy-

1359
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:42,484
My child, my poor child.

1360
01:53:43,443 --> 01:53:46,446
I want to die, Mother.

1361
01:53:46,905 --> 01:53:49,491
I really want to die.

1362
01:53:49,949 --> 01:53:53,828
There's nothing in the world
worth living for anymore.

1363
01:53:55,246 --> 01:53:57,290
In death...

1364
01:53:58,583 --> 01:54:06,508
everything's quiet and lovely
and peaceful, Mother.

1365
01:54:06,591 --> 01:54:09,844
Everything's peaceful.

1366
01:54:10,887 --> 01:54:13,181
I love you so much, Mother.

1367
01:54:14,265 --> 01:54:17,393
You take some tablets,

1368
01:54:17,477 --> 01:54:20,563
drop them in water,

1369
01:54:20,647 --> 01:54:22,982
swallow them

1370
01:54:23,566 --> 01:54:25,610
and sleep.

1371
01:54:27,487 --> 01:54:30,990
It's so good to sleep.

1372
01:54:31,074 --> 01:54:34,827
I haven't slept for so long.

1373
01:54:34,911 --> 01:54:38,206
I want to sleep.

1374
01:54:39,499 --> 01:54:43,461
A long, long sleep.

1375
01:56:04,584 --> 01:56:06,711
Gaby's sleeping.

1376
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:11,966
I'll be my old self again, Mother.

1377
01:56:12,675 --> 01:56:17,555
Where there's turmoil,
human beings are so feeble.

1378
01:56:19,557 --> 01:56:23,144
It's been thirty-five years since you were born.

1379
01:56:24,854 --> 01:56:27,231
Gaby has had a shock.

1380
01:56:27,315 --> 01:56:29,150
Mother, I beg you.

1381
01:56:29,233 --> 01:56:32,654
This isn't a reproach.
You should simply know.

1382
01:56:34,822 --> 01:56:37,283
I visited Father's grave.

1383
01:56:37,784 --> 01:56:41,245
Somebody had laid flowers on it.
I don't know who.

1384
01:56:41,621 --> 01:56:44,165
It's the second time.

1385
01:56:47,919 --> 01:56:52,048
I was afraid you'd despise me
because of Karin.

1386
01:56:52,131 --> 01:56:54,008
I know.

1387
01:56:55,134 --> 01:56:57,095
Perhaps I do.

1388
01:57:00,348 --> 01:57:03,101
It was raining thirty-five years ago.

1389
01:57:05,311 --> 01:57:08,356
The rain was beating
on the window panes.

1390
01:57:08,439 --> 01:57:11,109
I'm so afraid.

1391
01:57:12,944 --> 01:57:15,196
I'm so alone.

1392
01:57:17,573 --> 01:57:21,369
I often visit Father's grave.
Much more than I used to.

1393
01:57:23,287 --> 01:57:25,790
And I go to church again.

1394
01:57:25,873 --> 01:57:32,296
I didn't even enjoy my work
these last six months.

1395
01:57:34,173 --> 01:57:38,886
I had the feeling my head
was bursting with pain.

1396
01:57:40,722 --> 01:57:43,558
You must have
the courage to believe.

1397
01:57:44,642 --> 01:57:47,854
Everyone needs some kind of solace.

1398
01:57:49,021 --> 01:57:50,732
And...

1399
01:57:52,191 --> 01:57:55,027
one is alone without God.

1400
01:57:55,445 --> 01:57:58,990
That's no solace, Mother.

1401
01:58:00,658 --> 01:58:03,828
You have to learn to love
without demanding.

1402
01:58:03,911 --> 01:58:05,872
It's the same thing, believe me.

1403
01:58:05,955 --> 01:58:08,499
I didn't love her.

1404
01:58:09,041 --> 01:58:11,878
I just wanted to possess her.

1405
01:58:12,879 --> 01:58:15,590
That's all over.

1406
01:58:16,966 --> 01:58:19,427
I've learned my lesson...

1407
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:23,264
and it was very painful.

1408
01:58:24,474 --> 01:58:27,226
You must be good to Gaby.

1409
01:58:27,310 --> 01:58:29,228
Children are so sensitive.

1410
01:58:29,312 --> 01:58:31,272
I know.

1411
01:58:32,231 --> 01:58:35,359
She cried terribly
before she fell asleep.

1412
01:58:35,985 --> 01:58:38,780
Don't torture me, Mother.

1413
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:41,866
What good does it do?

1414
01:58:41,949 --> 01:58:44,744
I have to speak my mind.

1415
01:59:00,301 --> 01:59:02,345
Petra Von Kant's residence.

1416
01:59:02,428 --> 01:59:04,222
Who?

1417
01:59:04,305 --> 01:59:06,098
Just a moment.

1418
01:59:08,017 --> 01:59:09,894


1419
01:59:18,903 --> 01:59:20,446


1420
01:59:24,116 --> 01:59:26,536
Yes, of course I minded.

1421
01:59:26,619 --> 01:59:30,581
But that's all over.

1422
01:59:32,291 --> 01:59:35,294
No, it's -

1423
01:59:35,795 --> 01:59:37,964
it's late now and -

1424
01:59:38,631 --> 01:59:40,508
No, I can't make it tomorrow.

1425
01:59:40,591 --> 01:59:42,802
You're off to Paris?

1426
01:59:43,719 --> 01:59:46,764
But <i>we'll</i> see each other sometime.

1427
01:59:46,848 --> 01:59:48,432
Of course.

1428
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:55,606
Take care.

1429
02:00:00,736 --> 02:00:03,614
You can go now, Mother.

1430
02:00:03,698 --> 02:00:06,033
I've calmed down now.

1431
02:00:07,243 --> 02:00:09,871
I've made peace with the world.

1432
02:00:17,753 --> 02:00:19,213
I'll give you a call.

1433
02:00:59,837 --> 02:01:03,424
I have to apologise to you
for many things, Marlene.

1434
02:01:04,759 --> 02:01:09,597
In the future, I would really like us
to work together.

1435
02:01:10,514 --> 02:01:13,351
You'll have what you're entitled to:

1436
02:01:13,768 --> 02:01:15,061
freedom and fun.

1437
02:01:21,442 --> 02:01:23,527
Not like that.

1438
02:01:31,035 --> 02:01:33,621
Tell me about yourself.

1439
02:04:33,467 --> 02:04:36,720
