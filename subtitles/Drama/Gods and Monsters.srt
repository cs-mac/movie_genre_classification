She was nothing

Oh, well, yes.
Why not?

But she tells me
that you haven't been

Well, it's these ridiculous

For instance, the luminal.

going off in a hundred

Well, yes, but today I wanted
to be alert for your visit,

get to the horror movies?

in assuming, mr. Kay,

153
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,032
That it is not me that
you are interested in,

brought you
to hollywood.

I've got
a little proposal.

161
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,064
This line of questioning
is getting old.

162
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,188
Don't you think?

00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,462

interesting for me.

question that you put to me,

167

And in return,
for each answer,

00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:48,174

174
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,154
So the rumors
are true then.

175
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,486
Oh? What rumors
would those be?

176
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,362

forced to retire

177

Because of, um,
a sex scandal.

178
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,399
A homosexual scandal,
you mean.

179
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,265

of that magnitude,

00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,911
You'll have to remove
both your shoes and socks.

181
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,508
You're a dirty old man.

182
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,481
Oh.

183
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:34,815
Oh, it is kind
of you to indulge your
elders in their vices,

184
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:39,791
Just as I indulge
the young in theirs.

185
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,171
No, there was no scandal.

186
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,478
My only other vice.

187
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:03,248
I expect you'd like a fuller
answer to that question.

188
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,820
It'll cost you your jacket.

189
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,960
Too warm
for a jacket anyway.

190
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:16,534
You must understand how
hollywood was 20 years ago.

191
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,100
Nobody cared a tinker's
cuss who you slept with,

192
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,840
So long as you kept
it out of the papers.

193
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:29,444
Well, outside
hollywood who even knows
who george cukor is,

194
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,182
Much less what he gets up

195
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:34,248
To with those boys
from the malt shops?

196
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,447
George cukor?

197
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,348
Who made
"a star is born?"

198
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,920
Take off your shirt, and
I'll tell you all about it.

199
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,931
George is famous for his
Saturday dinner parties.

200
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:57,344
Great writers, artists,
society folk,

201
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,437
All rubbing elbows
with hollywood royalty.

202
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,510
But how many of those
oh-so-proper people

203
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,480
Know about the Sunday
brunches that follow?

204
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,949
Armies of trade eating
up the leftovers,

205
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,480
Followed by some strenuous fun
and frolic in the pool.

206
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:18,086
Can we talk about
the horror movies now?

207
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:22,431
Is there anything in particular
that you want to know?

208
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,499
Will you tell me
everything you remember

209
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,498
About making
"frankenstein?"

210
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,570
[whispers] ohh.

211
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,909
Can that count
as one question?

212
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:37,537
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

213
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,389
Just like going
swimming, isn't it?

214
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,188
Well, maybe you'd like
a swim when we're through.

215
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:56,291
I don't swim myself,
so the pool tends
to go to waste.

216
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,526
Ok. "frankenstein."

217
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,670
Who came up
with the monster's
makeup and look?

218
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:03,937
Oh, my idea, mostly,
from my sketches.

219
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,337
Big, heavy brow.

220
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,908
The head flat on top

221
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,407
So you could take out the old
brain and put in the new

222
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,679
Like tinned beef.

223
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:11,637
[laughs]

224
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:14,345
He's one
of the great images

225
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:18,577
More important
than the "mona lisa."

226
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,075
Oh, don't be daft.

227
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,486
It's just makeup and
padding and a big actor.

228
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,990
It's hardly
the "mona lisa."

229
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:32,962
How did you ever
think of casting him
as the monster?

230
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:37,442
He'd never even starred
in a movie before that.

231
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,284
Mr. Whale?

232
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,284
Is something the matter?

233
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,981
[grunts]

234
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,154
Mr. Whale?

235
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,052
Please excuse me.

236
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,215
Mr. Whale,
are you all right?

237
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,962
[groaning]

238
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,959
Just...

239
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,960
Need to lie down.

240
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,064
Studio.

241
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,025
There's a day bed
in the studio.

242
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,473
[gasps]
oh, my god.

243
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,728
Mr. Whale,
wh-what's wrong?

244
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,166
Is it your heart?

245
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,141
No, head, not heart.

246
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,275
Water.
Glass is in sink.

247
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:24,251
Which ones?
I bring them all.

248
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,480
Luminal.

249
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,771
Mr. Kay, you're not dressed.

250
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,537
I was gonna
go swimming.

251
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,383
So you were.

252
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,339
Mmm.

253
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,546
You should probably go home.

254
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,253
[clicking tongue]

255
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,722
[screen door opens]

256
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,090
[door closes]

257
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,659
[inhales deeply]

258
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,287
You must think
I'm terrible, hanna.

259
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,133
I don't think you're
anything anymore.

260
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,770
Already you're
chasing after boys.

261
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:14,797
Oh, shut up.

262
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:18,101
All we did was talk.

263
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,497
Perhaps I should
get you uphill

264
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:22,106
Before the pills
knock you cold.

265
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,708
No, no, no, no, no.

266
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,740
Please, no.

267
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,214
Let me stay here.

268
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,222
Thank you.

269
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
[soldiers shouting]

270
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,103
[gunfire, bombs exploding]

271
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,773
Man: Quiet on the set, please.

272
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,439
Father: You're
a disgrace!

273
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,808
Mother: Jimmy,
privy needs cleanin'.

274
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:56,407
Mr. Whale.

275
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,408
Open your eyes.

276
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,082
Now look left.

277
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,845
That's right.

278
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,823
And breathe out.

279
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,592
[exhales]

280
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,690
Let's see
what we've got.

281
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,392
You're a lucky man,
mr. Whale.

282
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,164
Whatever damage was
done by your stroke,

283
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,462
It left your motor
abilities relatively
unimpaired.

284
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,326
Yes, dr. Payne, but what
about from the neck upwards?

285
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,565
What's the story there?

286
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,770
That's what I'm
trying to explain.

287
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,812
The central nervous system
selects items

288
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,867
From a constant
storm of sensations.

289
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,836
Whatever was killed
in your stroke

290
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:36,275
Seems to have
short-circuited
this mechanism.

291
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,782
So you're saying there's
an electrical storm

292
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,215
Going on inside my head.

293
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,220
Well, that's as good a way
as any to describe it.

294
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,863
I've seen far worse cases.

295
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,658
What about all the rest?

296
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,859
The killing headaches.

297
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,661
The phantom smells.

298
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,762
My inability
to close my eyes

299
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:55,134
Without thinking
of a hundred things
simultaneously.

300
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,735
I've never
encountered the olfactory
hallucinations before,

301
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,638
But I'm sure they're related.

302
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,810
So, what do I do?

303
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,168
Take the luminal to sleep

304
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,136
And whenever you feel
an attack coming on.

305
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,245
What you're saying is
that this isn't just

306
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,247
A case of resting
until I'm better,

307
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:12,249
But that my condition
will continue

308
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,522
To deteriorate until
the end of my life.

309
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,934
You will take them all,
mr. Jimmy.

310
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,528
Yes.
Don't you worry, hanna.

311
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,561
Good night.

312
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,495
Thank you.

313
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,693
[whispers prayer]

314
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,560
Ohh!

315
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,329
[continues praying]

316
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,927
[chuckles]

317
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,738
[equipment thuds]

318
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,914
[equipment rattling]

319
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,945
Clay: Shit.

320
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,289
Everything all right,
mr. Boone?

321
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,959
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

322
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:25,958
It got away from me.

323
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,959
I was just going
to buzz hanna

324
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,701
To bring down
some iced tea.

325
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:34,327
I'd like it very much
if you'd join me.

326
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,704
I kinda stink to
high heaven right now.

327
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,774
Let me ask hanna
to bring tea for two.

328
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,973
Or would you prefer a beer?

329
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,306
Uh, no.

330
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,010
Thanks. But tea is fine.

331
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,282
Splendid.

332
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,994
Come in, mr. Boone.

333
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,464
This is my workshop,
my studio.

334
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,291
Hardly somewhere where
a sweaty workman

335
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,356
Should feel out of place.

336
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:09,997
Are these your paintings?

337
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,773
Excuse me, but, uh,
are you famous?

338
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,273
Oh, well, you know
what they say,

339
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:17,436
If you have to ask...

340
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,283
Look, I'm just a guy
who cuts lawns,

341
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,879
But, uh, some of these
do look kind of familiar.

342
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,881
Well, that's because
they were familiar
when I painted them.

343
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:28,494
The one you're looking
at is a copy of a dutch
still life

344
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,388
Done nearly
300 years ago.

345
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,361
And there's a rembrandt
here somewhere.

346
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,900
Yeah, copies.
I got ya.

347
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,297
But before I retired,

348
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,569
You might say I had
my time in the sun.

349
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:47,439
Tell me, do you like
motion pictures?

350
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,810
Yeah, sure.

351
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,738
Everybody does.

352
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,382
Why? Were you an actor?

353
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:53,377
Oh, good lord, no!

354
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,649
No. Well, actually,
I was in my youth.

355
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,048
But never in hollywood,
no, no.

356
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:00,691
No, here I was merely
a director.

357
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,787
Really?

358
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:06,419
Well, what were some
of your movies?

359
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,926
The only ones
you may have heard of

360
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,428
Are the
"frankenstein" movies.

361
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,961
And, um, uh,
"bride of frankenstein?"

362
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,396
And son of, and
the other ones, too?

363
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,072
Uh, no. I-I just
directed the first two.

364
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,401
The others
were done by hacks.

365
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,766
Yeah, but still, I mean,
th-those were big movies.

366
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,106
I mean, you must be rich.

367
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:29,011
Look, hanna's here
with our refreshments.

368
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,875
Could you get the door?

369
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,053
Y-yeah.

370
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,804
How are you feeling,
mr. Jimmy?

371
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,397
How's your mind today?

372
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,030
My mind is lovely.

373
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,625
And yours?

374
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:54,406
You remember what
the doctor tells us.

375
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:59,137
I have invited
mr. Boone in merely
for a cup of tea.

376
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,375
[sighs]

377
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,911
We'll have a brief chat,

378
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,915
And then he'll
finish the yard.

379
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:08,817
I am not forgetting
your last "brief chat."

380
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,921
Will you go away?

381
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,623
We can manage.

382
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,125
He looks plenty big.

383
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:17,927
He won't need my help
if anything goes "flooey."

384
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,930
Go.

385
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,069
Avaunt.

386
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,468
[chuckles]

387
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,570
Comic maid.

388
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,976
No, she's a love, hanna.

389
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,008
But when they've
been in your employ
for too long,

390
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,583
Servants begin to think
they're married to you.

391
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:41,892
Please sit down.
Oh, and do help
yourself, mr. Boone.

392
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:50,458
So, what did she mean by
things going all "flooey"?

393
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:54,033
I'm recently returned
from a spell in hospital.

394
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:58,603
Nothing serious.
Touch of stroke.

395
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,474
Huh.

396
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,154
You must excuse
my staring,

397
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:16,491
But you have the most
marvelous head.

398
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,019
Huh?

399
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,963
To an artistic eye.

400
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,488
Have you ever modeled?

401
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:23,663
What, you mean,
like, posed for pictures?

402
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,133
Sat for an artist?

403
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,531
Been sketched?

404
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,002
Mmm...

405
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,240
[laughs] no.
What's to sketch?

406
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,637
You have the most...

407
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,969
Architectural skull.

408
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:39,475
And your nose, it's...

409
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,849
Very expressive.

410
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,484
Broke is more like it.

411
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,515
Mmm.

412
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,787
Oh, sorry to go
on like this.

413
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,820
It's just the Sunday
painter in me.

414
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,525
I quite understand
your refusal.

415
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:56,487
It's a great deal
to ask of anyone.

416
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,496
You mean, you really
want to draw me?

417
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,269
I would pay
for the privilege
of drawing that head.

418
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,798
And it's just my head
you want to draw?

419
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:05,874
I mean, nothin' else?

420
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,612
And what are
you suggesting?

421
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:13,037
If I include a hand
or a bit of shoulder?

422
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:16,105
No, I mean,
you don't wanna...

423
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:19,515
Draw pictures of me in
my birthday suit, do you?

424
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,819
I have no interest in
your body, mr. Boone.

425
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,292
I can assure you
of that.

426
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:29,591
Well, uh...

427
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:30,895
[chuckles]

428
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:35,297
I mean, hell, I could
use the money.

429
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,541
Excellent.

430
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,221
Here are the trade papers
you wanted.

431
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,601
Hi. Look, I know you
already paid me.

432
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,674
I'm just here to...

433
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,642
The master
is waiting for you.

434
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,340
He's down in his studio.

435
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,212
Here. Take this
with you.

436
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,140
Uh, I'm sorry, lady.

437
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:23,276
I'm just here so he
can draw my picture.

438
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:27,022
What you are doing is
no business of mine.

439
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,219
What are you talking about?

440
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,350
What kind of man are you?

441
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:31,786
Are you a good man?

442
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,891
Something about me
make you think I'm not?

443
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,034
You will not hurt him?

444
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,628
Lady, I'm gonna
sit in a chair,

445
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,660
And he's gonna
draw my picture.

446
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:41,825
Is that gonna hurt him?

447
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,101
No.

448
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,343
I'm sorry.

449
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,309
Forget
everything I said.

450
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:49,667
I will take the tray.

451
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:52,275
Yeah, you do that.

452
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,677
Ah, mr. Boone.
Come into my parlor.

453
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:57,681
Ah, hanna. Good.

454
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,953
Thank you.

455
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,685
And, hanna, good-bye.

456
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:05,358
Well, now, I'm sure you
would like to wet

457
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:07,888
Your whistle
while I work. Hmm?

458
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:09,293
Oh. Beer.

459
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,625
And we'll take it,
uh, slowly today

460
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,002
Because this is your
first time modeling.

461
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,071
Oh, hey, did you see this?

462
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,369
They're showing one of
your movies tomorrow night.

463
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,642
You don't say.
Which picture?

464
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,241
Uh, "bride of frankenstein."

465
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:27,142
No, I much prefer
"the invisible man"
or "showboat."

466
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,946
Right. Now,
shall we begin?

467
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,919
Yeah. I'm, uh...

468
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,677
I'm ready when you are.

469
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:36,416
Oh, that shirt,
mr. Boone.

470
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:37,392
Hmm?

471
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,760
Oh, it's new.

472
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:41,958
It's just too white.
It's too distracting.

473
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:45,761
W-w-would it be
asking you too much
to take it off?

474
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:48,865
Well, I'm not wearing
an undershirt today.

475
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,668
I'm not your
aunt tillie. [laughing]

476
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:54,671
You did say that
you just wanted to draw
my face, right?

477
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,414
Oh, well, if it's
going to make you
feel uncomfortable,

478
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:01,750
Perhaps we can find
something else
for you to wear.

479
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:10,746
Yes, we could
drape this across your
shoulders like a toga.

480
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:14,456
Would that help
you overcome your
schoolgirl shyness?

481
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,960
All right, all right.
I'll take the shirt off.

482
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,732
Kinda warm in here anyway.

483
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,970
Oh, yes.
That's better.

484
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,813
Now...

485
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,879
And if you'd like to sit
slightly sideways...

486
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,749
To me.
That's right.

487
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:40,318
And then just put your
arm on the box there.

488
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,789
Just so.

489
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,133
Why don't you
take a picture?

490
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:57,325
It'll last longer.

491
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:01,506
That's exactly what
I'm going to do.

492
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:03,907
[mutters] yeah.

493
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,836
Hmm.

494
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,453
It's just like being
at the doctor.

495
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:15,793
You have to remain
perfectly still

496
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,988
While I examine
and scrutinize you.

497
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,761
[sniffing]

498
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,255
Dripping.

499
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,495
Huh?

500
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,299
Do you ever eat dripping
in this country?

501
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:36,905
The fats from
roast and such.

502
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,839
Kept congealed
in a jar,

503
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,354
And then used
like butter on bread
and toast.

504
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,177
Sounds like something
you'd feed the dog.

505
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:47,023
Only the poorest
families ever ate it.

506
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,289
We used to keep ours

507
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,217
In a large, blue
crockery jar.

508
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:54,262
Your family ate,
uh, dripping?

509
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,030
Oh, of course not.
No, no.

510
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:00,999
As I said, only
the poorest families.

511
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,565
God, it's ironic.

512
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:12,812
I've spent much of my
life outrunning the past,

513
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,552
And now it floods
all over me.

514
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:18,078
There's something about
the openness of your face

515
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,883
That makes me want
to tell the truth.

516
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:25,256
Yes, our family
ate dripping.

517
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,587
Beef dripping.

518
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,433
And four to a bed.

519
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,428
And a privy out back
in the alley.

520
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:35,271
Are you also from
the slums, mr. Boone?

521
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:39,837
Well, we weren't rich, but
w-w-we weren't poor either.

522
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,509
No, well, you were
middle class, hmm?

523
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,168
Like all americans, hmm?

524
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,836
Well, I don't know.

525
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:47,606
I guess you could
say we lived

526
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,313
On the wrong side
of the tracks.

527
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:51,575
Well, in dudley, in
the north of England,

528
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:53,154
There were more sides
to the tracks

529
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:55,592
Than any american
could imagine.

530
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:57,958
Every englishman
knows his place,

531
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:02,227
Our family had no doubt
about who they were,

532
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:05,858
But I was an aberration
in that household,

533
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,295
A freak of nature.

534
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:11,239
I had imagination,
cleverness, joy.

535
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,967
Now, where
did I get that?

536
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:16,043
[chuckles]

537
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,881
Certainly not from them.

538
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,549
They took me out of
school when I was 14

539
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,550
And put me in a factory.

540
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,916
They meant no harm.

541
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,155
They were like
a family of farmers

542
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,988
Who've been
given a giraffe

543
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,564
And don't know what
to do with the creature

544
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:40,902
Except to harness him
to the plow.

545
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,602
Hatred was
the only thing that
kept my soul alive

546
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:51,584
In that
soul-killing place.

547
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,646
And amongst the men I hated

548
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:59,948
Was my own poor,
dear, dumb father...

549
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:05,258
Who'd put me into that hell
in the first place.

550
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,433
Mr. Whale?

551
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,936
[groans]

552
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,078
I apologize, mr. Boone.

553
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:38,594
Since my stroke, I am often
overcome with nostalgia.

554
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,330
Well, I'm not that crazy
about the old man myself.

555
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,487
You know what I mean?

556
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,129
Um...

557
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:55,241
Shall we just have a break
for five minutes, hmm?

558
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,140
[sniffs]

559
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,143
Just what this place
needs tonight.

560
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,646
Couldn't get
any deader, doll.

561
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,379
Set me up.

562
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,254
Your friend
want one?

563
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:11,762
Yeah. One for
what's-his-name here.

564
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,759
I say we let lover boy
watch his movie

565
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:20,002
And be grateful
he's not cuttin'
shirley temple's lawn.

566
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:23,269
Why is everyone breakin'
my balls tonight?

567
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,398
Jesus, boone.

568
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:29,073
'cause
some old coot wants
to paint your picture.

569
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,114
We're just bringin' you
back to earth.

570
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,641
Can't imagine a real
artist wanting

571
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,576
To spend time lookin'
at that kisser.

572
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:43,423
That you couldn't lay
under it a couple of times.

573
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,692
[laughing]

574
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:49,794
I bet he's just
some fruit pretending
to be famous

575
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:52,425
So he can get into
the big guy's pants.

576
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:53,761
What makes you say that?

577
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:59,196
Well, why don't you
just keep your dirty
thoughts to yourself?

578
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,514
He's interested in you
for your conversation.

579
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:05,438
We all know what
a great talker you are.

580
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,078
Fuck you.

581
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:11,621
Not anymore, you don't.

582
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,491
We're watching
the damn movie, harry.

583
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,057
Ok, we're gonna
watch the movie.

584
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:21,057
Calm down.
We'll watch it.

585
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,226
[dramatic score playing]

586
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,107
James whale!
Right there. Huh?

587
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:41,181
What'd I tell ya? Huh?

588
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,082
What should I do then?

589
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,723
Aah!

590
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:50,187
If you don't wanna watch it,
just go wash some glasses.

591
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:51,589
All right?

592
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,132
[growls]

593
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,129
Good old una.

594
00:34:59,131 --> 00:34:59,831
[screaming]

595
00:34:59,832 --> 00:35:01,232
Gobbling like
a turkey hen.

596
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,533
[laughs, imitates
una screaming]

597
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:08,336
Oh, that monster.
How could you be
working with him?

598
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,640
Don't be daft, hanna.

599
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,481
He's a very
proper actor.

600
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:15,847
And the dullest
fellow imaginable.

601
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:20,578
To a new world
of gods and monsters.

602
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:21,846
[laughs]

603
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:23,454
[laughing]

604
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,488
Man: The creation
of life is enthralling.

605
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:28,833
Simply enthralling,
is it not?

606
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:31,427
These old movies
were such a hoot.

607
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,730
They thought
they were being scary,

608
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:33,701
But they're just funny.

609
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,699
Maybe it's supposed
to be funny.

610
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:38,301
Scary is scary.
Funny is funny.

611
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,603
You don't mix them.

612
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:42,305
Woman.

613
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,507
Friend.

614
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,910
Wife.

615
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:49,652
Sick stuff.
Necrophilia.

616
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,278
The monster's lonely.
He wants a friend.

617
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,884
A girlfriend, somebody.

618
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,916
What's so sick about that?

619
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:59,361
Man: Do you know who
henry frankenstein is,

620
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,488
And who you are?

621
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:05,203
Monster: Made me from dead.

622
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,227
I love dead.

623
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,532
Hate living.

624
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:13,665
Man: You are wise
in your generation.

625
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:20,311
It's beating perfectly.

626
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,459
[gasps]

627
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:33,617
Oh, she's horrible.

628
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:37,255
The bride
of frankenstein.

629
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,298
She's beautiful.

630
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,774
Monster: Friend?

631
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,713
[mutters]

632
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,509
You don't want him.

633
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,841
I can't leave them!
I can't!

634
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:56,276
Yes.

635
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,311
Go.

636
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,976
You live!

637
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,224
[growls]

638
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,998
[sniffs]

639
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,227
I'm sorry, mr. Jimmy.

640
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,533
Your movie
is not my teacup.

641
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:21,265
Still, glad it has
a happy ending.

642
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:23,243
The bad people are dead,

643
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,682
And the good people live.

644
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,257
[applause]

645
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,025
My god!

646
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,801
Is the audience
to presume

647
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,569
That colin and I have
done her hair?

648
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,839
I thought we were
mad scientists,

649
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,398
Not hairdressers.

650
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:57,706
Only a mad scientist
could've done this to a woman.

651
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:01,409
Oh, no, my dear. You
look absolutely amazing.

652
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,613
There's no way
I can compete with you.

653
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,015
The scene is yours.

654
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,617
In the sequel, james,

655
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:09,348
Two lady scientists
should make a monster,

656
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:12,324
And our monster
would be gary cooper.

657
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,024
I'd have thought
mr. Leslie howard

658
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,356
Would be more your line.

659
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,361
More your line, I think.

660
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:23,433
My line nowadays
runs to rin tin tin.

661
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:24,625
Colin! Here!

662
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,596
It's time!
How is he tonight?

663
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:31,735
Yes, colin, come see what
they've done to our elsa.

664
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:34,383
I'm not quite
myself today, jimmy.

665
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,679
A touch of the flu,
you know.

666
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,511
Now, you just relax,
dear boy.

667
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,846
You can do this
scene in your sleep.

668
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,392
Hmm?

669
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:49,387
I gather we not
only did her hair,
but dressed her.

670
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:52,504
What a couple of queens
we are, colin.

671
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,427
Yes, that's right.

672
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:54,832
A couple of flaming queens.

673
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,503
Pretorius
is a little bit

674
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,471
In love with
dr. Frankenstein.

675
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:00,571
You know? Hmm?

676
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,842
Uh-huh?

677
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,640
Yes. I think we're
pretty close.

678
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,443
Mm-hmm.
Shall we give it a go?

679
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:09,406
Why not?

680
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,048
Quiet on the set,
please.

681
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,121
[bell rings]

682
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,819
Lights!

683
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:16,651
Sound!

684
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,115
Man: Ok for sound!

685
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,423
And camera.

686
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:22,834
Scene 215, take one.

687
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,131
Action.

688
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:49,386
The bride of
frankenstein.

689
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,474
Well, that was
a weird movie.

690
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:09,141
Let's take
a little walk, huh?

691
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:10,411
What do you say?

692
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,479
A little walk and talk?

693
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:15,907
I really feel like
talking tonight.

694
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,017
This old guy's exactly
the sort of person

695
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,850
I expected to meet
when I moved here.

696
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:26,815
You know? He's really done
things with his life.

697
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,025
Do you realize
you're more interested
in this old goober

698
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,427
Than you ever
were in me?

699
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:31,829
That's different
he's a man.

700
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,930
Besides, you got no business
callin' him a homo. You know?

701
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,903
It never crossed
your mind?

702
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:37,972
He's an artist,
but, you know,

703
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,899
He's too old to be
thinkin' about sex.

704
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:44,105
All the old men
I know think about
nothing but sex.

705
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,038
Hey, hey, hey.

706
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,784
What is eating you tonight?

707
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,479
You picked up that girl
right in front of me.

708
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:53,182
No, I'm actually kind of
glad it happened.

709
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:56,845
It made me wonder
what the hell I was
doin' with my life.

710
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:59,815
I still have time
to get things right,

711
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:02,485
Get married again.

712
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,503
Y-you don't mean...

713
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:10,229
[giggling]

714
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,172
You're not
marriage material.

715
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:20,505
You're not even
boyfriend material.

716
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:21,642
You're a kid.

717
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,876
A big, fun,
irresponsible kid.

718
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,484
No, I'm not a kid.

719
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:28,516
No? What
are you, then?

720
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,550
What'll you be
ten years from now?

721
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:31,855
Still cuttin' lawns?

722
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:35,257
Still bangin'
horny divorcees
in your trailer?

723
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,160
So I guess this means
you don't want to fuck.

724
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:46,139
Is that all this conversation
means to you?

725
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,537
Whether I put out or not?

726
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,639
Yeah, you're damn straight.

727
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,240
I'm tired of playin' games.

728
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,620
Hey.

729
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,719
Look, this is comin'
out all wrong.

730
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,091
Betty!
Forget it, boone.

731
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:08,529
You're just another loser on
the other side of the bar.

732
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:10,857
Hey. Hey!
Hey, betty!

733
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,032
Oh.

734
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,115
Man: We are friends,
you and I.

735
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:38,292
Monster: You hurt
my poor friend.

736
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:41,060
Woman: Isn't
the monster dead yet?

737
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,059
[elsa laughing]

738
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,831
Elsa/shelley: Perfect night
for mystery and horror.

739
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,700
Monster: Bad.
Friend good.

740
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:54,170
Elsa/shelley: The air itself
is filled with monsters.

741
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,002
[electricity buzzing,
crackling]

742
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,679
[groaning]

743
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:23,726
[urinating]

744
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,802
Does the yard man
come today?

745
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:34,002
Of course.
This afternoon.

746
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,012
Hey!

747
00:44:41,312 --> 00:44:45,082
The master wants to know
if you are free for lunch.

748
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:48,793
I tell him you'll be
having other plans,

749
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,187
But he insists I ask.

750
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,418
Well, I do have a lawn
this afternoon,

751
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:54,294
But I'm free until then.

752
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:58,092
Expect nothing fancy.

753
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,199
The master is dressing.

754
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:05,272
I'm to offer you a drink.

755
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,900
There is whiskey.
There is iced tea.

756
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:08,866
Yeah, tea's fine.

757
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,713
No, no, you're
a guest now.

758
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,479
You go sit in
the living room.

759
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:15,137
Um, I'm more comfortable
in here, hanna.

760
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:17,146
It is hanna, isn't it?

761
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,878
[sighs]

762
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:25,964
So, uh, hanna, how long have
you worked here for mr. Whale?

763
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:26,987
Oh, long enough.

764
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,761
Fifteen years.
Yeah?

765
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,960
You have people, boone?

766
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:34,833
They're all back
in joplin, missouri.

767
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,133
Oh, your wife?

768
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:37,774
Uh, I'm not married.

769
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,439
Why?

770
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,873
I don't know.

771
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:41,972
I guess because, uh...

772
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:44,373
No girl in her right mind
would have me.

773
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,835
A man who is not
married has nothing.

774
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:49,346
He is a man of trouble.

775
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:53,347
Are you proposing what
I think you're proposing?

776
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:58,351
Don't you think I'm just
a little bit young for you?

777
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:04,994
Oh, men!

778
00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:06,826
Always pulling legs.

779
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:07,831
Everything is comedy.

780
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:09,832
Oh, how very amusing.

781
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,034
How marvelously droll.

782
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:18,271
So, uh...Have you
ever been married?

783
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,076
Of course.
I'm married still.

784
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:21,378
What does your husband do?

785
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:22,849
He's dead now.

786
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:25,147
Well, then you're
as single as I am.

787
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,850
No, no, I have children,
and grandchildren, too.

788
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:30,053
I visit when I can.

789
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:33,324
Of course, now mr. Jimmy
cannot be left alone

790
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:36,864
For long, so I do
not get out much.

791
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,401
[sighs]
poor mr. Jimmy.

792
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:40,797
There is much
good in him,

793
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:43,869
But he will suffer
the fires of hell.

794
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:44,898
It's very sad.

795
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:45,873
You sure of that?

796
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,900
That's what
the priests tell me.

797
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:51,506
His sins of
the flesh will keep
him from heaven.

798
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:53,339
Hell, everybody's
got those.

799
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:57,154
No. His is the worst.

800
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,594
The unspeakable.

801
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:09,892
The deed no man can name
without shame.

802
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:12,134
What is
the good english?

803
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,060
All I know is "bugger."
he's a bugger.

804
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,825
Men who bugger
each other.

805
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:16,604
A homo.

806
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,401
[chuckling] yes!
You know.

807
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:21,374
That is why he must
go to hell.

808
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:22,872
I do not think
it's fair,

809
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:26,014
But god's laws
is not for us to judge.

810
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,380
So, what you're telling me
is that mr. Whale is a homo.

811
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,451
You did not know?

812
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,350
Uh...

813
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,491
No. I wasn't very sure.

814
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,217
You and he are not--

815
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:39,463
Oh, no, no, no.

816
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:41,317
Hanna.
[laughing]

817
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:42,526
[gasps]

818
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:43,927
That's what I hope.

819
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:46,898
I did not think you
were a bugger, too.

820
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:48,258
Whale: Hanna?

821
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,926
Oh. You must
go in quickly.

822
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:54,904
He would not like
to think I've had
you in the kitchen.

823
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,124
Oh. How are you,
mr. Boone?

824
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:10,647
I'm so glad you could
come for lunch.

825
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:16,586
"her majesty's loyal
subjects in the motion
picture industry."

826
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:21,604
"cordially invited to
a reception at the home
of mr. George cukor."

827
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,269
The pushy little--
[sighs]

828
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:25,669
Horning in on the
queen's little sister,

829
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:29,210
And then offering
to share her with
the whole damn raj?

830
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:32,907
This is a world I
finished with long ago.

831
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:37,581
And I expect them to
return the compliment.

832
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,920
Cheers.

833
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:54,460
I, uh, I watched
your movie the other night
with some friends.

834
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:56,225
Did you, now?

835
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:57,234
Yeah.

836
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:59,335
Did anyone laugh?

837
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:04,067
Pity. People are so
earnest these days.

838
00:49:04,075 --> 00:49:06,005
Why? Was it
supposed to be funny?

839
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,680
Yes, of course.

840
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,649
I had to make
it interesting
for myself, you see.

841
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:14,119
So, a comedy
about death...

842
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,448
The trick is not
to spoil it for anyone

843
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,064
Who's not
in on the joke.

844
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:22,987
But the monster
never receives any
of my jibes.

845
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:27,704
He's noble.
Noble and misunderstood.

846
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:37,641
In korea, mr. Boone...
Did you kill anyone?

847
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,040
I don't like
to talk about that.

848
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:43,206
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

849
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:44,754
In the service
of one's country,

850
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:46,479
Something
to be proud of.

851
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,494
Any jerk with a gun
can kill someone.

852
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,017
Well, that's true, yes.

853
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:56,193
Hand-to-hand combat
is the true test.

854
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,264
Did you ever slay
anyone hand-to-hand?

855
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:01,204
No.

856
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:03,529
But I could have, though.

857
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:07,204
Yes, I believe
you could.

858
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,577
How free is your
schedule this afternoon?

859
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:15,037
Well, I gotta trim
the hedges,

860
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:17,106
And then I got another lawn
out on la cienega.

861
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:20,245
Suppose we say "phooey"
to the hedges.

862
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:25,421
Can you spare
an hour after lunch
to sit for me?

863
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:29,589
Um...I can't.

864
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:31,134
Well, I'll pay
you our going rate,

865
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:34,199
Plus whatever you would
have got for the hedges.

866
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:39,665
I-I just don't feel
like sittin' still today.

867
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,200
All righty.

868
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,541
I understand.

869
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,331
You ever been
married, mr. Whale?

870
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,774
No.

871
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,099
Well, not in
the legal sense.

872
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:16,065
What other sense
is there?

873
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,074
Well, one can live
as husband and wife

874
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:19,776
Without getting
the law involved.

875
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:23,077
So then you did have a wife?

876
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:26,181
Depending on which
of us you asked.

877
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:30,424
My friend david lived
here for many years.

878
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,491
Oh.

879
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:36,130
Does that surprise you?

880
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,430
No, um...

881
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,759
You're a homosexual.

882
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,166
Mmm!

883
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,497
If one must use
the clinical name.

884
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:47,873
I'm not, you know.

885
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,812
I never
thought you were.

886
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,853
You don't think of me
that way, do you?

887
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:59,147
And what way
would that be?

888
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,420
Well, the way that
I look at women.

889
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,790
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

890
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:11,159
Would break my neck
if I so much as laid
a finger on you.

891
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:17,471
Besides,
you're not my type.

892
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,441
So we understand
each other.

893
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:30,175
Hey. Live and let live.

894
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,782
I hope this has
got nothing to do

895
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:36,794
With your refusing
to sit for me today.

896
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:37,917
Oh, no.

897
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:40,922
What are you afraid
of, mr. Boone?

898
00:52:40,925 --> 00:52:44,655
Surely not a frail
old man like me.

899
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,901
Tell me more about
yourself, mr. Boone.

900
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:56,635
Have you
a steady companion?

901
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:59,211
Not at the moment.

902
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:03,580
Well, 'cause I guess
you gotta kiss ass

903
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:05,881
Just to get a piece of it.

904
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:08,183
Nicely put.

905
00:53:08,186 --> 00:53:10,816
A man's gotta
make up his life alone.

906
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:13,661
A philosopher. Mmm.

907
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:15,488
Thoreau...

908
00:53:15,493 --> 00:53:17,533
With a lawn mower.

909
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:21,499
Yes. But do be
careful, mr. Boone.

910
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:25,569
Freedom is a drug,
you know, much like
any other.

911
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,200
Too much can be
a very bad thing.

912
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:32,266
Is that why you and,
uh, your friend split up?

913
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:34,276
'cause he wanted to be free?

914
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:37,408
I know it's why I
stopped making pictures.

915
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,715
You might not think
it to look at me now,

916
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,247
But there was
a time when I was

917
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,952
At the very pinnacle
of my profession.

918
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:44,654
The horror movies
were behind me.

919
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,255
I'd made "showboat."

920
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:47,387
Major success.

921
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,931
So now I was to do
something important.

922
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:53,258
The picture was called
"the road back."

923
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:56,804
It was an indictment
of the great war and
what it did to germany.

924
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:59,441
It was going to be
my masterpiece.

925
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:00,637
What happened?

926
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:02,338
The fucking studio
butchered it.

927
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,240
They brought
in another director
to add some slapstick

928
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:08,675
And the movie
laid an egg.

929
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:12,749
A great, expensive bomb
for which I was blamed.

930
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:15,749
And after that
I was out of fashion.

931
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:18,293
I could
no longer command
the best projects,

932
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:25,289
Why should I spend my
time working in this
dreadful business?

933
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,756
Do you miss it?

934
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,974
Oh, it was all
so long ago.

935
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:32,937
Fifteen years.

936
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:39,307
Making movies
is the most wonderful
thing in the world.

937
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,714
Working with friends,
entertaining people.

938
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:47,745
Yes, I suppose
I miss it.

939
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,315
But I chose freedom.

940
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,755
David,
of course, was still
in the thick of it,

941
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:58,829
A life chockablock
with anxiety and
studio intrigue.

942
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,299
I didn't fancy spending
my golden years

943
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:02,699
As "the friend,"

944
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:08,970
So I finally
drew down the curtain
and closed the show.

945
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:17,010
And, um, when the
fetters are loosened,

946
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:19,084
A certain hedonism
creeps in,

947
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:24,423
Oh, there was a time
when this house was
full of young men.

948
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:25,722
Some of them
even posed for me,

949
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:27,923
Right where
you're sitting now.

950
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,725
Of course, they weren't
nearly so bashful.

951
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:33,398
Oh, no,
this studio was full

952
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:36,397
Of bare buttocks
and pricks. Mmm.

953
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,630
Hard, arrogant pricks.

954
00:55:38,636 --> 00:55:43,536
Isn't it bad enough
that you've told me
you're a fuckin' fairy?

955
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:45,411
And now you're gonna rub
my face in it?

956
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:48,379
Mr. Boone, I assure you,
I didn't mean--

957
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:49,079
Fuck this!

958
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,680
From now on, I'm just
the guy that cuts your lawn.

959
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,884
Got it?

960
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,519
[door swings shut]

961
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,033
Man: Jimmy?

962
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,456
Come on, jimmy.

963
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:11,396
Watch me dive.

964
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,183
Clay: Hey, harry.
Set me up.

965
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:01,122
[jukebox country swing]

966
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:02,148
Where's betty?

967
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:04,553
Took the night off.

968
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:09,755
Some guy she's had her
eye on for a while.

969
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,788
Hey!

970
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,787
Hi!

971
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,962
[panting, moaning]

972
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,982
Hello, helen.
It's clay.

973
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,682
No, I'm not in jail.

974
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:09,054
No, I don't need
any money. Thanks.

975
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:11,223
There's this movie guy
I met out here.

976
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:12,592
She'd get
a real bang out of it.

977
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:15,820
Just let me talk--
where is she?

978
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,263
You don't know.

979
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:23,532
Yeah, I'd give you
my phone number if I had
a phone, wouldn't I?

980
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,733
Put the old man on.

981
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:26,996
Yeah, you know, forget it.

982
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,704
Just let him sleep it off.

983
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:30,006
All right. Yeah.

984
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:31,837
Time's up, helen, now.

985
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,182
[voice on phone, faint]

986
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:36,577
I'm out of dimes.

987
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,510
Uh-huh.

988
00:58:37,515 --> 00:58:39,515
Have one for me.

989
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,630
Mr. Boone.

990
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:58,573
Thank you, hanna.

991
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,742
I wanna sit for you again.

992
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:10,812
Only if you promise to ease up
on the locker room talk, ok?

993
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,576
Scout's honor.

994
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:16,946
[chuckles]

995
00:59:16,954 --> 00:59:18,294
I'm curious, mr. Boone.

996
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,989
What convinced you
to come back?

997
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:22,291
I don't know.

998
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:24,133
I like your stories,
I guess.

999
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:27,558
Oh, everyone's
got stories to tell.

1000
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,225
Not me.

1001
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:33,673
And the fear that you
displayed at our last session.

1002
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:34,701
How did you overcome that?

1003
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:37,005
More like disgust.

1004
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:38,937
Oh, same difference,
mr. Boone.

1005
00:59:38,943 --> 00:59:42,583
All part of the great gulf
that stands between us two.

1006
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,680
Am I right in assuming that
you have little experience

1007
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:48,353
With men of my persuasion?

1008
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:51,322
No teammates in football?

1009
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:52,692
No.

1010
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:56,990
You must think that
the whole world is queer.

1011
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:59,364
Well, you know what?
It's not.

1012
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:01,363
And war certainly isn't.

1013
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:04,865
Oh, there may be no
atheists in the foxholes,

1014
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:07,668
But there are,
occasionally, lovers.

1015
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,371
You're talkin'
through your hat now.

1016
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:12,713
No, I'm not. I was
in the foxholes myself.

1017
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:13,780
You were a soldier?

1018
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,677
I was an officer
in the trenches.

1019
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,650
No, my dear,
the crimean war.

1020
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,080
Well, what do you think?

1021
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:22,115
The great war.

1022
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,689
There were trenches
when I arrived

1023
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:25,347
And trenches when
I left two years later.

1024
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:27,986
Just like in the movies,
only the movies, ahh,

1025
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:31,692
They never get
the stench of it all.

1026
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,895
The world reduced
to mud and sandbags

1027
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:38,628
And a narrow strip
of rainy sky.

1028
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,402
What were we talking about?

1029
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,766
Oh.

1030
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:47,413
Love.

1031
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:50,011
Love in the trenches.

1032
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:52,154
Barnett.

1033
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:55,675
Was that his name?

1034
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,152
Leonard barnett.

1035
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:04,826
He'd come straight
to the front from school.

1036
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,664
From harrow.

1037
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:13,395
And he looked up to me.

1038
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,444
Wasn't like the others.

1039
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:18,709
He didn't care that
I was a working-class man

1040
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:21,009
Impersonating my betters.

1041
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:26,754
How strange to be
admired so blindly.

1042
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,720
I suppose he loved me.

1043
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:34,317
I remember one morning
in particular,

1044
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:37,764
A morning when
the sun came out.

1045
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:43,271
There were days
when the weather was
enough to make one happy.

1046
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:44,827
He and I stood
on the fire step.

1047
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:47,895
I was showing him
the sights of no-man's-land.

1048
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:50,205
It was beautiful.

1049
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,870
Beautiful.

1050
01:01:52,876 --> 01:02:00,046
With a tall, apple-cheeked
schoolboy who loved me...

1051
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,891
And trusted me.

1052
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,498
You will not do
this to me again, mr...

1053
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:20,772
[gasps]
mr. Boone.

1054
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:24,211
You will not set me on
another walk down memory lane.

1055
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:27,838
I...I won't.

1056
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:31,845
[sniffles] oh, why do
I tell you all this?

1057
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:34,249
I never even remembered
it till you got me going.

1058
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:35,751
You started in on this.

1059
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:38,223
You can't understand.
You just sit there.

1060
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:42,392
"yes, the poor old man,"
you're thinking to yourself.

1061
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:43,932
Yeah. "the crazy old poof."

1062
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,387
Why are you here?

1063
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:46,795
Let's get this straight.

1064
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,397
What do you want from me?

1065
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:50,528
You wanted me to model.
Remember?

1066
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:54,044
What do you think I am,
so fucking senile?

1067
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,020
Uh, uh, mr. Whale?

1068
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:11,918
[murmuring quietly]
oh, I'm so stupid.

1069
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,792
Stupid, stupid.

1070
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:16,991
Mr. Whale,
you all right?

1071
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,225
What was I thinking about?

1072
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,932
Oh, would you go?

1073
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:28,236
I'm sorry. Please.

1074
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:31,468
Why don't you just go?

1075
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,814
I just don't get it.

1076
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:35,581
First you creep me out
with this homo shit.

1077
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:38,109
Then you hit me
with war stories.

1078
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:41,275
And now you're
upset with me because
I listened to you?

1079
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:42,915
What do you want?

1080
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,150
I want...

1081
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:50,229
More than anything else,
I want a glass of water.

1082
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:52,457
Sick.

1083
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:01,339
Thank you.

1084
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:04,338
I do apologize. I'm...

1085
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:10,612
I have no business
snapping at you.

1086
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:19,894
It was foolishness to start
this portrait, you know.

1087
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:24,430
You mean you don't
want me to sit
for you anymore?

1088
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,037
Would you like to come
to a party with me?

1089
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,176
A reception
for princess margaret.

1090
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:48,982
I thought you said
you weren't gonna go.

1091
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:51,616
If you don't mind driving...

1092
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:54,062
I'd like to take
you as my guest.

1093
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,187
Yeah, sure,
I'm game. Why not?

1094
01:04:57,194 --> 01:04:58,894
Very good, clayton.

1095
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,956
May I call you clayton?

1096
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:03,404
Clayton?

1097
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:09,667
Yeah, sure.
Clayton's fine.

1098
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:13,913
Mr. Boone, he's
an interesting friend.

1099
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:16,651
I'd hardly call
our yardman a friend.

1100
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:19,577
Oh, no, but someone
you can talk to.

1101
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,023
That needs
pressing, hmm?

1102
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:25,649
Do you miss having someone
to talk to, hanna?

1103
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:27,116
I have my family.

1104
01:05:27,124 --> 01:05:29,264
Also our lord,
jesus christ.

1105
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,989
Tell me, how is
the old boy these days?

1106
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:36,426
We need a hat with that.
There's a panama.

1107
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,203
Oh, maybe in your old room.

1108
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:41,041
No, no,
in the storage closet.

1109
01:05:41,038 --> 01:05:42,668
[sighs]

1110
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:44,943
[ringing continues]

1111
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:48,683
Hello.

1112
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:50,079
Oh, eva.

1113
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,450
[speaking
scandinavian language]

1114
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:19,507
[soldiers shouting]

1115
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:22,539
[gunfire, explosions]

1116
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:24,206
Whale: Gas masks on!

1117
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:25,654
[shouting continues]

1118
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:28,479
[gunfire, explosions
continue]

1119
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,702
Oh, mr. Jimmy.

1120
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:46,068
She said she and her
husband are coming to
town this afternoon.

1121
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:48,499
Here. I'm sorry,
mr. Jimmy.

1122
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:49,665
I will make it short.

1123
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,473
I will be out
myself this afternoon.

1124
01:06:52,476 --> 01:06:54,506
Remember?

1125
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:01,317
I suppose you'd
like the top down.

1126
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:03,178
If that's all
right with you.

1127
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:06,016
Nothing would
please me more.

1128
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:10,531
[engine starts]

1129
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,496
[speaks
scandinavian language]

1130
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:26,109
Whale:
Oh, good old george.

1131
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:29,309
He loves
to put on the dog.

1132
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:31,252
Slim pickings.

1133
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:33,108
Mind you,
it's early yet.

1134
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:38,446
Perhaps this is a good
time for us to go and
pay our respects, hmm?

1135
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:41,085
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

1136
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:42,321
Charming.

1137
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:43,385
[gasps]

1138
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,563
I had no idea
you would be here.

1139
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:47,503
How are you?

1140
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:49,097
Fine.
I'm just fine.

1141
01:07:49,099 --> 01:07:53,539
Splendid, now that I
know that you're around.

1142
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:55,497
Can we get together
while I'm in town?

1143
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:58,535
I so badly want
to sit for you again.

1144
01:07:58,542 --> 01:07:59,772
Sit?

1145
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:00,836
I've changed my hair,

1146
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:02,844
You see, since
our last session.

1147
01:08:02,846 --> 01:08:07,076
Those old snaps look
rather dowdy now.

1148
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:13,688
Oh, dear.
Have I made a blunder?

1149
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,820
The pleasure is mine.

1150
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:18,086
James whale.

1151
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:19,725
I am such a goose.

1152
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:21,829
I mistook you
for cecil beaton.

1153
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:23,262
It's the hat.

1154
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:26,196
You're wearing one of
cecil's hats, you know.

1155
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:28,203
George, james whale.

1156
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:30,735
David lewis's friend.

1157
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,740
I used to make pictures
myself, ma'am.

1158
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:40,123
Without hitting
one of us old
movie directors.

1159
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,477
[both chuckling]

1160
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:48,392
Ma'am, may I introduce
mr. Clayton boone.

1161
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:51,191
My gardener.

1162
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:51,864
How do you do?

1163
01:08:51,862 --> 01:08:53,262
Clay--
clay boone.

1164
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:54,133
Quite.

1165
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:55,501
I adore gardens.

1166
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:57,499
[all chuckling]

1167
01:08:57,501 --> 01:09:00,341
He's never
met a princess.

1168
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:03,507
Only queens.

1169
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:07,909
Well, george, ma'am,

1170
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:09,341
This has been an honor,

1171
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:11,706
And one that
I shall remember

1172
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:14,345
For the rest of my life.

1173
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:24,892
Great place.

1174
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:26,355
Mmm.

1175
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:28,163
[chuckles]

1176
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,201
Hello.

1177
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,902
What was that all about?

1178
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:36,165
Oh, don't worry.

1179
01:09:36,173 --> 01:09:40,843
Just two old men
slapping each other
with lilies.

1180
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,384
I'm sorry.

1181
01:09:42,379 --> 01:09:43,849
[woman laughs]

1182
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:44,947
Who's that?

1183
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:48,818
The friend I thought
was in new york.

1184
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,188
No, the girl.

1185
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:51,947
Oh, it's
elizabeth taylor.

1186
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,955
Oh, thank you.

1187
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,192
Yes, david produced
her last picture.

1188
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:00,656
What are you doing here?

1189
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:03,204
I was just going
to ask you the same thing.

1190
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,270
Thought you were
still in new york.

1191
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:07,838
I was, until last night.

1192
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:10,237
I was going to call.

1193
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:10,970
David lewis.

1194
01:10:10,974 --> 01:10:16,314
Our yardman, who's been kind
enough to serve as my escort

1195
01:10:16,313 --> 01:10:19,253
To george's little do.

1196
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:22,318
Should you be drinking
in your condition?

1197
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:25,789
Oh, david, will you
stop being a nanny.

1198
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:29,559
I think I'm gonna go
and get another beer.

1199
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:37,501
You should've seen george's
face when he saw clayton.

1200
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,630
Oh! [giggles]

1201
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:40,695
You didn't, jimmy.

1202
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:45,544
Mind you, princess margaret's
an absolute doll.

1203
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:48,782
Well, we're all equals
in her eyes...

1204
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:50,608
As commoners, I presume.

1205
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:53,354
You only
embarrass yourself.

1206
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,250
I'll never work
in this town again.

1207
01:10:55,252 --> 01:10:56,882
You know what I mean.

1208
01:10:56,886 --> 01:10:57,986
Your reputation.

1209
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:00,918
I have no reputation.

1210
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:03,294
I am as free as the air.

1211
01:11:03,293 --> 01:11:06,293
But the rest
of us aren't.

1212
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:08,256
Can't you
remember that?

1213
01:11:08,265 --> 01:11:09,025
No.

1214
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:10,632
I never could.

1215
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:15,444
I suppose you regret
having got me invited here.

1216
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:18,608
I didn't ask george
to invite you.

1217
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,638
Oh. Well, then, who did?

1218
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:23,044
I have people here
I need to speak to.

1219
01:11:23,046 --> 01:11:25,846
You'll be all right
on your own?

1220
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:28,279
Yes, yes, perfectly.

1221
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:31,650
I'll drop by tomorrow
for breakfast.

1222
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:33,415
Oh, yes.

1223
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,758
Oh.

1224
01:11:38,762 --> 01:11:40,532
Oh, I say.

1225
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,560
Thank you very much.

1226
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:46,325
Just the one. Hmm.

1227
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,320
[sighs]

1228
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,469
Mr. Whale!

1229
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:24,742
Mr. Whale!

1230
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,341
[high-pitched giggle]

1231
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:28,814
Mr. Whale.

1232
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:32,552
Bet you never thought
you'd see me again.

1233
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:35,919
I didn't know
if you'd be well enough
to come to this party.

1234
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:41,819
I'm the one who got you
on mr. Cukor's guest list.

1235
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:44,385
You, mr. Kay?

1236
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:47,364
But how do you know
george cukor?

1237
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:49,604
I interviewed him
after I met you.

1238
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:51,569
I'm his social secretary now.

1239
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:55,398
Well, assistant
to his secretary.

1240
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:56,695
Yes, I commend you. Yes.

1241
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,636
If you're going
to pursue poofs,

1242
01:12:58,641 --> 01:13:01,441
Go after those who
can do favors for you.

1243
01:13:01,444 --> 01:13:06,084
You just waste
everyone's time when
you court dinosaurs.

1244
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:09,722
Don't think
like that, mr. Whale.

1245
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,149
I love your movies.

1246
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:12,454
That's why I wanted
you to come,

1247
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:15,115
So I could see you
with your monsters.

1248
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,855
My monsters?

1249
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,390
Don't go away.

1250
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,125
[giggles]

1251
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:23,661
Uh, excuse me.

1252
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,126
Miss lanchester.
Yes?

1253
01:13:25,135 --> 01:13:26,825
[whispers]

1254
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:29,036
Elsa.

1255
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,082
Jimmy!

1256
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,089
Elsa.

1257
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,018
How are you?

1258
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:48,923
Mmm.

1259
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:51,188
[giggles]

1260
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:54,504
I saw una o'connor
a few weeks ago.

1261
01:13:54,497 --> 01:13:56,627
She said you'd been
under the weather.

1262
01:13:56,633 --> 01:13:59,473
Oh, well, nothing
out of the ordinary.

1263
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:00,739
Getting old.

1264
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:04,967
Ah, what's our
pesky friend up to now?

1265
01:14:04,974 --> 01:14:06,174
Mmm?

1266
01:14:06,176 --> 01:14:08,536
Is that boris?

1267
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:12,675
Our little chum appears
to be arranging a reunion.

1268
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:13,582
Oh, dear.

1269
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,983
Boris, darling.

1270
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:16,624
Elsa. Elsa!

1271
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,489
And james.

1272
01:14:18,488 --> 01:14:19,218
James.

1273
01:14:19,222 --> 01:14:21,522
How good to see you.

1274
01:14:21,524 --> 01:14:23,094
I didn't know you were here.

1275
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:25,492
These public revels
are hardly up your alley.

1276
01:14:25,495 --> 01:14:29,695
Actually, I'm here
for the sake of miranda,

1277
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:33,199
My great-grandniece.

1278
01:14:33,203 --> 01:14:34,973
Koochie-koo.

1279
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,911
And what do you make
of our royal visitant?

1280
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:39,537
Perfectly charming.

1281
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:43,582
What did you expect,
a hussy in tennis shoes?

1282
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,580
[laughs]

1283
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:46,251
Hey, you,
with the camera.

1284
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:47,819
We got a historical
moment here.

1285
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:48,917
Come, get
a picture of it.

1286
01:14:48,918 --> 01:14:50,948
This is
mr. James whale,

1287
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:52,094
Who made
"frankenstein"

1288
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:53,588
And "bride
of frankenstein,"

1289
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:56,720
And this--forget
the baby a second--

1290
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:59,186
Is...The monster...

1291
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:01,755
And his bride.

1292
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:04,004
Oh, karloff. Right.

1293
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:11,836
Don't you just love
being famous?

1294
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:17,682
To a new world
of gods and monsters.

1295
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,010
[gunfire,
explosions continue]

1296
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,662
[screaming]

1297
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,185
Are you all right,
jimmy?

1298
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:33,194
Yeah. Yeah.

1299
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,555
Got it.

1300
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,211
Clay: Mr. Whale.

1301
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,706
Are you ok?

1302
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,551
I'm tired.
I'm a bit tired.

1303
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:53,748
Are you enjoying yourself?

1304
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:57,620
Actually,
I feel a little
out of place here.

1305
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:01,590
Well, neither of us
really fits in here.

1306
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:06,631
That must've been
funny for you, seeing
your monsters again.

1307
01:16:06,629 --> 01:16:07,329
Monsters?

1308
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,600
The only monsters are here.

1309
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,729
[thunder crashes]

1310
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:13,574
[guests chattering,
screaming]

1311
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:16,200
Oh, fuck.
We left the top down.

1312
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:17,935
You wanna run for it?

1313
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:19,141
"run for it"?

1314
01:16:19,142 --> 01:16:20,742
It's raining.

1315
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,343
Woman: Hurry! Hurry!

1316
01:16:22,345 --> 01:16:24,345
Whoo!

1317
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:27,107
[hooting, laughing]

1318
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,643
Mr. Whale?

1319
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,766
Mr. Whale.

1320
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:56,335
Let's get out
of this fuckhole.

1321
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:58,376
You sure you don't want
to wait it out?

1322
01:16:58,381 --> 01:17:00,751
We aren't made of sugar.

1323
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:02,220
We won't melt.

1324
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:07,688
"oh, that this too, too
solid flesh would melt."

1325
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:12,030
I'm getting you home
before you catch your
death of pneumonia.

1326
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:14,328
Catch my death?

1327
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:17,630
Are you ok, mr. Whale?

1328
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:21,703
Jimmy, please, hmm?

1329
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,644
Call me jimmy.

1330
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,310
[engine starts, revs]

1331
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:31,746
[thunder continues]

1332
01:17:31,748 --> 01:17:33,208
Hanna, we need some towels!

1333
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:34,976
We're soaked to the bone!

1334
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:41,664
Well, if we soil your floors,
it's your own bloody fault!

1335
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:47,404
Oh, I don't believe it.

1336
01:17:47,397 --> 01:17:49,127
Oh, don't worry.
She'll be back.

1337
01:17:49,132 --> 01:17:50,902
She just can't say "no"
to her daughter.

1338
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,670
Well, you certainly
have better things to do

1339
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,340
Than to baby-sit an old man.

1340
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,198
I didn't have
anything planned.

1341
01:17:57,206 --> 01:18:00,106
Well, you go and get
a shower upstairs

1342
01:18:00,109 --> 01:18:02,909
And I'll get you
something dry to wear.

1343
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:05,682
[thunder continues]

1344
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:13,192
Well, what do you think?

1345
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,759
Hmm?

1346
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:18,027
Mr. Whale?

1347
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:24,395
Where are those
clothes you promised?

1348
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,200
Mr. Whale?

1349
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:29,372
He trusts me, you know.

1350
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,705
Mr. Whale?

1351
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,883
Jimmy?

1352
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,452
Oh, yes.

1353
01:18:45,455 --> 01:18:46,915
Mr. Whale?

1354
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:48,763
Huh?

1355
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,833
Yes, of course,
uh, clayton.

1356
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:56,130
Now, I promised to get
you some dry clothes.

1357
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:58,072
The trouble is,
you're so large.

1358
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,497
You wouldn't want to attempt
to get into my pants.

1359
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:02,503
Uh, n-no.
Definitely not.

1360
01:19:02,505 --> 01:19:04,035
Very good, clayton.

1361
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,340
Now...

1362
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:06,811
Oh, I know!

1363
01:19:06,809 --> 01:19:09,039
This--this absolutely
swims on me,

1364
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:11,205
So that should deal
with your upper half.

1365
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:14,984
And now we just need to deal
with the rest, don't we?

1366
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:18,994
Do you have any baggy shorts
or pajama bottoms?

1367
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:20,518
Uh, no.
I'm sorry.

1368
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:22,823
Uh, my pajamas
are all tailored.

1369
01:19:22,825 --> 01:19:23,815
Would it be too
distressing for you

1370
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:28,156
It's hardly more
immodest than a kilt,
you know.

1371
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:31,274
How very sporting
of you, clayton.

1372
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,297
Say, is this, um...

1373
01:19:33,302 --> 01:19:37,272
Yes, it's the only
memento I ever kept.

1374
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,773
My original sketch
for the monster.

1375
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:42,236
Uh, shall we?

1376
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:43,775
Yeah.

1377
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,822
[thunder continues]

1378
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:59,061
If hanna's not back, shall
we try a few more sketches?

1379
01:19:59,061 --> 01:20:01,331
I thought you'd given up
on my drawing.

1380
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,300
Yeah, but I'd
like to try again.

1381
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:06,799
It'll give us something
to do while we wait.

1382
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,972
Tell me something, clayton.

1383
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:18,475
Do you believe
in mercy killing?

1384
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:20,351
I never really
gave it much thought.

1385
01:20:20,349 --> 01:20:23,179
You must've come across
such situations in korea.

1386
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:27,016
A wounded comrade,
or perhaps even an enemy.

1387
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:31,833
You know, someone for whom
death would be a blessing.

1388
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:34,358
I never went to korea.

1389
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:37,603
I never even made it
through boot camp.

1390
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,500
That I was a marine,
which is true.

1391
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:44,174
You filled in the rest.

1392
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,881
Oh, I see.

1393
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:52,882
My old man was a marine.

1394
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:55,582
Lied about his age,
and he enlisted.

1395
01:20:55,585 --> 01:20:57,015
Is this the great war?

1396
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,619
Yeah. Yeah.

1397
01:20:58,621 --> 01:20:59,921
By the time he was
ready to ship out,

1398
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:03,622
So, he felt like
he'd missed out.

1399
01:21:03,626 --> 01:21:06,156
Well, it was
a very lucky thing he did.

1400
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:07,632
That's not
the way he saw it.

1401
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:11,870
To him it was
like his life never
really got started.

1402
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:14,538
Nothing else
seemed to matter.

1403
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:16,896
Certainly
not his family.

1404
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:20,906
Is that why you became a marine,
for your father's sake?

1405
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:23,980
I figured it'd be
the next best thing.

1406
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,210
I mean, but, you know,
I loved it, too.

1407
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,875
It was a chance
to be a part of
something important,

1408
01:21:28,885 --> 01:21:32,885
Something that's bigger
than yourself.

1409
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:34,919
So, what happened?

1410
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:36,964
Didn't have
the guts for it.

1411
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:39,189
Hmm?

1412
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:40,995
Literally.

1413
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,533
My appendix burst.

1414
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:46,402
They gave me
a medical discharge.

1415
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,902
And the only thing
I can think is,

1416
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:51,444
How the hell am I gonna
tell my father?

1417
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:58,184
And you know what
happened when I finally
did tell him?

1418
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:02,517
He laughed at me.

1419
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:11,694
Well, them's
the breaks, huh?

1420
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:15,334
No war stories
for this pup.

1421
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:22,974
That's where
you're wrong, clayton.

1422
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:26,942
You just told me one.

1423
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,313
A very good story indeed.

1424
01:22:28,311 --> 01:22:30,641
[thunder continues]

1425
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:33,976
Whew. This storm
is getting worse.

1426
01:22:33,983 --> 01:22:39,053
"a perfect night
for mystery and horror.

1427
01:22:39,055 --> 01:22:42,515
The air itself is
filled with monsters."

1428
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:45,055
That's from one
of your movies, right?

1429
01:22:45,061 --> 01:22:46,491
Very good.

1430
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:49,625
"the only monsters
are here."

1431
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:52,032
Don't remember that one.

1432
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:55,404
This afternoon at the
party when you said,

1433
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,174
"the only monsters
are here,"

1434
01:22:57,173 --> 01:23:00,073
I was wondering
which "here" that was.

1435
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:03,476
No, I--I don't recall.

1436
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:08,322
Memories
of the war, perhaps.

1437
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,487
Barnett.

1438
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,661
Barnett on the wire.

1439
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:21,061
Your friend.

1440
01:23:21,063 --> 01:23:26,333
He caught his one night coming
back from reconnaissance.

1441
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:29,198
I wouldn't take him,
but mcgill did,

1442
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:32,505
"just to give
the laddie a taste."

1443
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:38,178
They were nearly home when
a maxim gun opened fire.

1444
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:45,049
Barnet's body
landed on this wire

1445
01:23:45,054 --> 01:23:46,154
That was as thick as briers.

1446
01:23:46,155 --> 01:23:47,545
It was hanging there
the next morning.

1447
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:51,426
It was only a hundred yards
from the line, but too far...

1448
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:55,697
For anyone to fetch it.

1449
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,769
So we saw him
every morning stand-to

1450
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:06,340
"good morning, barnett,"
we used to say to him.

1451
01:24:06,342 --> 01:24:08,042
"how's old barnett
looking today? "

1452
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:12,384
"he seemed a little peaked.
Looks a little plumper."

1453
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,051
And if he hung there...

1454
01:24:15,051 --> 01:24:16,251
[exhales]

1455
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:18,692
Well, at least until
we were relieved.

1456
01:24:18,687 --> 01:24:22,317
We introduced him to the new
unit before marching out,

1457
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:26,564
Speaking highly
of his companionship.

1458
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:31,299
God, we were a witty lot.

1459
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,800
Laughing at our dead, feeling
that it was our death, too.

1460
01:24:35,805 --> 01:24:39,265
But I tell you, for each
man who died I thought,

1461
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:44,075
"better you than me,
poor sod."

1462
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:49,647
You know, a whole generation
was wiped out by that war.

1463
01:24:49,652 --> 01:24:50,752
[thunder continues]

1464
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:53,093
You survived it.

1465
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,361
Can't hurt you now.

1466
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:57,117
No good to dig it up.

1467
01:24:57,126 --> 01:24:58,626
Oh.

1468
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:01,727
Friend, it's digging
itself up.

1469
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:05,830
There is nothing in the here
and now to take my mind off it.

1470
01:25:05,835 --> 01:25:07,795
The parties...

1471
01:25:07,803 --> 01:25:09,843
Well, you were there.

1472
01:25:09,839 --> 01:25:12,539
Reading...I can't--

1473
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,371
I-I can't concentrate.

1474
01:25:14,376 --> 01:25:17,476
There's no work, of course,

1475
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:22,620
And, uh, love and,
uh, painting and, uh...

1476
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:29,794
Drawing, I mean.

1477
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,804
Look.

1478
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:40,332
Your portrait, clayton.

1479
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:45,311
It's all gone for me now.

1480
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:47,137
All gone.

1481
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:52,479
They're nothing but the
scribblings of an infant.

1482
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,881
There's nothing.

1483
01:25:54,884 --> 01:25:57,154
Nothing.

1484
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,750
You said you wanted
to draw me like a statue.

1485
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:34,861
There.

1486
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:00,251
It's going to
happen after all.

1487
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:03,245
What did you say?

1488
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:06,251
No, it won't do.

1489
01:27:06,255 --> 01:27:07,345
What won't do?

1490
01:27:07,356 --> 01:27:09,316
You're much too human.

1491
01:27:09,325 --> 01:27:13,225
Well, what do
you expect, bronze?

1492
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:17,262
Don't move.

1493
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:25,267
[grunting noise]

1494
01:27:30,778 --> 01:27:33,308
I want you to wear this.

1495
01:27:33,315 --> 01:27:35,575
Just so I can see
the artistic effect.

1496
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:39,554
Your very human body
against the inhuman mask.

1497
01:27:39,555 --> 01:27:41,415
Oh! Very striking.

1498
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:41,993
Mmm.

1499
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:43,321
I don't know.

1500
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:45,785
Just for a minute, so
I can see the effects.

1501
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:47,434
From the first world war,
isn't it?

1502
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,659
Fasten this
around the back.

1503
01:27:49,665 --> 01:27:51,895
Let me help you.

1504
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,330
There.

1505
01:27:54,336 --> 01:27:55,936
Hmm?

1506
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,741
[sniffing, gasping]

1507
01:27:59,742 --> 01:28:02,512
Uh...

1508
01:28:02,511 --> 01:28:03,511
Now what?

1509
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:05,612
All right,
let's take it off.

1510
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:08,354
Uh, it's too tight.
I can't breathe.

1511
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:11,550
Oh, no, l-l-leave it.
I'll help.

1512
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:14,023
Leave it to me.

1513
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:20,026
Wha-can you--

1514
01:28:20,029 --> 01:28:22,059
I'm still here.

1515
01:28:22,064 --> 01:28:23,804
Um...

1516
01:28:25,566 --> 01:28:27,496
Mr. Whale.

1517
01:28:27,503 --> 01:28:30,643
Oh, what steely muscles
you've got there.

1518
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,409
Just take the fuckin'
mask off me now, ok?

1519
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:37,080
What a solid brute you are.

1520
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:39,679
Hey, just get your
fuckin' hands off me!

1521
01:28:39,682 --> 01:28:41,922
It's no use, clayton.
I can't hear you.

1522
01:28:41,917 --> 01:28:44,377
I can't hear a word.

1523
01:28:44,386 --> 01:28:47,346
Oh, well, then, maybe this.

1524
01:28:47,356 --> 01:28:48,656
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1525
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:51,657
[whale groans]

1526
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,660
Ohh!

1527
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:57,031
How will you ever
get yourself back?

1528
01:28:57,032 --> 01:28:58,732
I told you,
I'm not that way!

1529
01:28:58,734 --> 01:29:01,744
Get it through your
fuckin' head, all right?

1530
01:29:01,737 --> 01:29:05,107
You feel
so good, clayton.

1531
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:07,437
Uhh!

1532
01:29:07,443 --> 01:29:09,413
Didn't even sting!

1533
01:29:09,411 --> 01:29:11,951
[grunting, laughing]

1534
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:14,107
Wait till I tell
my friends about this.

1535
01:29:14,116 --> 01:29:15,446
Won't they be surprised.

1536
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:16,721
I haven't done
anything with you

1537
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:19,919
[gasps] you
undressed for me.

1538
01:29:19,922 --> 01:29:21,422
I've been kissing you.

1539
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:24,423
How will you ever be able
to live with yourself?

1540
01:29:24,426 --> 01:29:25,526
What do you want from me?

1541
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:27,387
[laughing hysterically]

1542
01:29:27,396 --> 01:29:29,526
I want you to kill me.

1543
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:30,701
What?

1544
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:32,499
Break my neck.

1545
01:29:32,501 --> 01:29:35,371
It'll be
so easy to choke
the life out of me.

1546
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:40,071
Come on, clayton.
We've come this far.

1547
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:41,805
I'm losing my mind.

1548
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:43,140
Every day a new piece
of it goes,

1549
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:45,375
And soon there'll
be none of it left.

1550
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:51,391
But if you kill me,
death will be bearable.

1551
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:55,120
You could be
my second monster.

1552
01:29:55,124 --> 01:29:56,494
Come on.

1553
01:29:56,492 --> 01:29:58,962
Please, do it now.

1554
01:29:58,961 --> 01:30:00,791
Make me invisible.

1555
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:03,556
[panting, groaning]

1556
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,800
I am not...

1557
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:11,574
Your monster!

1558
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:16,581
[sobbing]

1559
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:24,077
[grunts]

1560
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:27,916
[sobbing continues]

1561
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:33,588
You're a bloody pussycat.

1562
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:50,178
My deepest apologies.

1563
01:30:50,179 --> 01:30:53,109
Can you ever forgive me?

1564
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:57,615
No, I suppose not.

1565
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:04,123
[exhaling]

1566
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:18,140
I've got to go to bed.

1567
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,154
Are you ok?

1568
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:33,647
Oh, clayton.

1569
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:35,215
Do you need some help?

1570
01:31:35,224 --> 01:31:39,734
Pray, you
undo this button.

1571
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:47,830
I don't seem to be able
to manage it when I'm tired.

1572
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:54,839
Do you believe
people come into our
lives for a purpose?

1573
01:31:57,845 --> 01:32:00,505
Ok, I can manage now.

1574
01:32:04,086 --> 01:32:11,526
When you die, make sure
that your brain is the
last organ to fizzle.

1575
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:15,164
You'll feel better tomorrow.

1576
01:32:15,163 --> 01:32:17,033

1577
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:21,026
[groaning]

1578
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:28,884
Good night.

1579
01:32:30,811 --> 01:32:32,111
Good night.

1580
01:32:32,114 --> 01:32:34,884

1581
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:39,722

1584

[snorts, gasps]

1586
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:13,907
Hanna: Hello?

1587
01:34:13,915 --> 01:34:15,275
Oh, hello, mr. David.

1588
01:34:15,283 --> 01:34:18,423
No, he did not tell me,
but that's no problem.

1589
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,690
I make the breakfast.

1590
01:34:19,688 --> 01:34:21,388
Yes, very good.

1591
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:22,960
Good-bye.

1592
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:24,418
[groans]

1593
01:34:24,426 --> 01:34:25,856
Hanna, this is not
what you think it is.

1594
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:26,931
[shoes land on floor]
aah!

1595
01:34:26,928 --> 01:34:29,698
All I ask is you
get dressed and go.

1596
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:32,198
Hanna, I need to talk
to you about mr. Whale.

1597
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,240
There is nothing you could
say would surprise me.

1598
01:34:35,237 --> 01:34:37,997
Maybe, but I still need
to talk to you about him.

1599
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:43,076
[scoffs] I blame
my daughter for keeping
me out so late.

1600
01:34:43,078 --> 01:34:45,378
I only hope you did not
get him excited.

1601
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:48,350
You could give him
new stroke.

1602
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,350
Why do you do it, hanna?

1603
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:51,282
What I do?

1604
01:34:51,286 --> 01:34:54,746
Like he was your
own flesh and blood?

1605
01:34:54,756 --> 01:34:58,216
I did it when he was
happy. It was easy.

1606
01:34:58,226 --> 01:35:01,356
It's only fair I do it
now he is ill.

1607
01:35:01,363 --> 01:35:02,463
Oh, enough of this talk.

1608
01:35:02,464 --> 01:35:05,734
I must go wake the master.

1609
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:13,441
Mr. Jimmy, good morning.

1610
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:16,042
Mr. Jimmy?

1611
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,784
What have
you done with him?

1612
01:35:21,783 --> 01:35:22,723
You look for him.

1613
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,448
I put him to bed
last night.

1614
01:35:24,453 --> 01:35:25,423
Mr. Jimmy?

1615
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:28,390
Mr. Jimmy!

1616
01:36:04,825 --> 01:36:07,525
[grunting]

1617
01:36:07,529 --> 01:36:09,159
Mr. Jimmy!

1618
01:36:09,164 --> 01:36:11,264
Mr. Jimmy!

1619
01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:13,799
Crazy son of a bitch!

1620
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:17,102
Oh! No! No! No!

1621
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,095
Mr. Jimmy!

1622
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:20,236
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1623
01:36:20,242 --> 01:36:24,542
H-he wanted me to kill him,
and then he did it himself!

1624
01:36:24,546 --> 01:36:26,146
I didn't do this!

1625
01:36:26,148 --> 01:36:28,818
Mr. Jimmy.

1626
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:32,915
It says here,
"good-bye."

1627
01:36:32,921 --> 01:36:34,921
I find in his room.

1628
01:36:34,923 --> 01:36:36,293
Sorry, he says.

1629
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,861
He's had wonderful life.

1630
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:40,860
Oh, my mr. Jimmy.

1631
01:36:40,862 --> 01:36:42,902
Poor, foolish man.

1632
01:36:42,898 --> 01:36:44,798
[moaning]

1633
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:52,311
You could not wait for god
to take you in his time?

1634
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:55,135
You must leave.

1635
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,313
You were not
here this morning.

1636
01:36:57,312 --> 01:36:59,112
Look, I did not do this.

1637
01:36:59,114 --> 01:37:00,314
Police will
not know that.

1638
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:01,815
They will want
to investigate.

1639
01:37:01,817 --> 01:37:04,547
You want them to question
you about mr. Jimmy?

1640
01:37:04,553 --> 01:37:08,353
Please, clayton, it's better
that I find the body alone.

1641
01:37:08,356 --> 01:37:11,556
How are you gonna explain how
you got him out of the water?

1642
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:14,330
[muttering in
scandinavian language]

1643
01:37:14,929 --> 01:37:16,399
You're right.

1644
01:37:16,398 --> 01:37:17,928
[sniffles]

1645
01:37:17,933 --> 01:37:19,373
Uh, we must put him back.

1646
01:37:19,367 --> 01:37:20,897
Wh-uh...

1647
01:37:20,902 --> 01:37:24,842
Oh, mr. Jimmy, we do not
mean disrespect.

1648
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,840
You will keep better
in water.

1654
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,070
Who are you?

1655
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:31,068
I think you're
a stranger to me.

1656
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:33,939
I cannot see you.

1657
01:38:33,942 --> 01:38:35,682
I cannot see anything.

1658
01:38:35,677 --> 01:38:40,677
You must please excuse me,
but I'm blind.

1659
01:38:40,682 --> 01:38:44,252
Blind man:
Perhaps you're afflicted, too.

1660
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:48,053
We shall be friends.

1661
01:38:48,056 --> 01:38:49,916
It's very lonely here,

1662
01:38:49,925 --> 01:38:51,615
And it's been
a long time since

1663
01:38:51,626 --> 01:38:54,626
Any human being
came into this hut.

1664
01:38:54,629 --> 01:39:01,269
I shall look after you,
and you will comfort me.

1668
01:39:07,309 --> 01:39:11,009
No, no.
This is good.

1669
01:39:11,012 --> 01:39:14,452
Smoke. You try.

1670
01:39:15,082 --> 01:39:16,052
Smoke.

[grunting, chuckling]

1675
01:39:30,064 --> 01:39:32,074
I was all alone.

1676
01:39:32,067 --> 01:39:35,027
It is bad to be alone.

1677
01:39:35,036 --> 01:39:38,536
Alone bad.

1678
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:41,040
Friend good.

1679
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:43,242
Friend good!

What did you think
of the movie?

1684
01:39:55,023 --> 01:39:56,123
Pretty cool.

1685
01:39:56,124 --> 01:39:58,424
Better than most
monster movies.

1686
01:39:58,426 --> 01:40:01,686
Yeah? I knew
the guy who made it.

1687
01:40:01,696 --> 01:40:04,656
Is this another one
of your stories?

1688
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,326
No.

1689
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:12,005
It's the original sketch
of the monster.

1690
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:24,517
Is this for real?

1691
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:28,189
Clay, the trash,
before it rains.

1692
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:31,120
