Jim Ferguson, a citizen
of the world.

176
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,400
Holiday-Est?-No.

177
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,000
Observe the decay of the
capitalist system.

178
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,400
Wow.

179
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,300
It has a good example here.

180
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,500
The young heiress kagumi.

181
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,800
That Parsitan!

182
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,700
"I do not approve?"
I'm disgusted.

183
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,700
In any decent society ...

184
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,900
S, maybe they're right.

185

He has too much power.

186

"Lord ..." Thank you.

187

Everything went very quickly.

I'm on my honeymoon.

193

"We're riding with?"
Slo a moment.

199
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,000
Do not worry. I do not intrude.

200
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,800
I know young people.

201
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,100
The target of all eyes.

202
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,900

"Of course.-S.

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
Sorry for the intromisin,

my daughter.

You are Hercule Porridge, the
famous detective francs?

209

Almost.
I am Hercule Poirot, the famous
Belgian detective.

210
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,300

00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,800
lnconfundible.

213
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,600
As I am also.

214
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,800
My mother is Salome Otterbourne,
the novelist.

215
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Otter ... Salom, of course.

216
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Encantado.

217
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,100
Two celebrities in one place.

218
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,100
Three, tell me.

219
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,300
I referaa genius,

220
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,700
not the mere money, Ser.

221
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,600
I present to you Colonel
Race, my old friend.

222
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,200
Ms. .. and her daughter ...

223
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,300
Encantada.

224
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,900
Sintense, ladies and Seorita.

225
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,800
Sb be writing a new book, Madam?

226
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,000
It takes place in Egypt, maybe?

227
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,800
Qu brilliant deduction, Sr.
Porridge!

228
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm here to absorb
the local color

229
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,300
to my great opus,''Snow
on the Sphinx.''

230
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,300
An enigma love ice cream
becomes incandescent

231
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,300
when a girl English, Recinos
graduate school

232
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,800
plays the heartless heart
of a cruel desert sheik.

233
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,700
I think Mr. Poirot

234
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,500
is not a regular reader of
novels romnticas, mother.

235
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,300
Of course s. All the French are.

236
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,000
Not afraid of a good sex.

237
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Unlike our major libraries.

238
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,400
Salome Otterbourne vetoed
by telling the truth

239
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,400
on men and women.

240
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
But she continues.

241
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,400
The truth, s.

242
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,400
It is so difficult
to tell the truth.

243
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,700
Thank you, Lord.

244
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,900
You may dance a tango
with me ...

245
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,000
seorita?

246
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,300
Exercise AFTER dinner.

247
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,200
You dance tango, Colonel?

248
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,800
"Soon, Mrs.
Otterbourne." Teach
him to do well.

249
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,700
As in Spain, when known
as the''girl''

250
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,900
ie with a sensual
and erotic touch.

251
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Damn, Jackie! DJanes quiet!

252
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,800
Waiter.

253
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,400
Poirot Lord!

254
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,100
Poirot Lord!

255
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,300
Linnet I saw it today.

256
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,200
However much you paid
to get away?

257
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Do not accept payment
or accept it.

258
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,700
What dir is friendship.

259
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
Qu have to say?

260
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,300
I do the ridiculous? I'm crazy?

261
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,900
Bury the dead.

262
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,400
Unlike the Egyptians,

263
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,900
keeping body

264
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,600
to ensure the eternity of the soul.
No.

265
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Properly and completely.
Give back to the past.

266
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,200
Slo Look forward.

267
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,000
Remember, time heals everything.

268
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,100
If you think you suffer,
est wrong.

269
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,400
Ms I'm enjoying it.

270
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,600
His pleasure is the worst
part of all this.

271
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,600
I do not care.

272
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,500
Simon was moy loved me.
Then came her ...

273
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,600
It's something Pequeño ...

274
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,000
but is lethal.

275
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,900
And my father taught me
to have a good tip.

276
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,900
Sometimes

277
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,300
I put this gun against his head

278
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,800
and AFTER slowly

279
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
pulling the trigger.

280
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,300
I want that noise
or every damsyms.

281
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,100
S what he feels.

282
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
We all feel sometimes.

283
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,400
But I warn you, seorita ...

284
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,200
D will not login to the
evil in his heart.

285
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Ah is host.

286
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,500
If love can not live ah,

287
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,600

288
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
Qu sad seorita.

289
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,100
Hello, Lord P.

-Back to the hotel? "Adnde ms?

291
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,700
It is a surprise to Linnet.
Feel that you like?

292
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,600
Depends. She smokes?

293
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,400
Slo A. Craven

294
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,400
For purposes upon ...

295
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,300
I spoke with Jackie?

296
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,100
S, a few minutes ago.

297
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,900
Qu good.
I hope it has entered
into reason.

298
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,100
For her, the reason is
the eternal vengeance.

299
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,900
Are you serious?

300
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Whenever I'm serious, my friend.

301
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,200
Jackie is stubborn, I s,

302
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,400
and very possessive.

303
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,200
"But surely ..." Quera possess?

304
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,900
I suppose s.

305
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,500
S.

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,300
Want the reins.

308
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,700
S, and a man can not
allow it, right?

309
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,800
Not at all.

310
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,900
When he meets Linnet ...

311
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,900
How to explain?

312
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,900
It was like the moon
after sunrise.

313
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,600
It does not show.

314
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,500
AFTER to meet you,
Jackie dej exist.

315

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,900
But how to solve your
current dilemma?

317

and guaranteed.

00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,800
"Right?" Lncorrecto.

338
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm Mrs. Van Schuyler

339
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,900
and want to go to my
room immediately.

340
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,800
Bowers will have the cabin
opposite to starboard.

341
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,800
The hot afternoon sun miracles

342
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,000
with bilious cheek and vinegary.

343
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,700
S. Right now, Madam.

344
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,500
S. You must be Dr. Bessner,

345
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,300
with this elegant
mustache German.

346
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,600
I fear that jams become
detective, Ser.

347
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,700
The mustache, indisputably
elegant, is Belgian.

348
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,500
My name is Poirot,

349
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,500
Hercule Poirot.

350
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,900
The famous Mr. Poirot?

351
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,700
I bow before you.

352
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,400
I am humbled.

353
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,400
Give simple names Serams

354
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
and you tell us the cabin.

355
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,300
More simple? S, seorita.

356
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,500
Undoubtedly more simple.
Definitely.

357
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,200
A lack of complicacin brilliant.

358
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,400
At one point, the lead assistant
to their cabins.

359
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Wizard!

360
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,200
We left.

361
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,000
I suggest you take the
LAST look at the city.

362
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,700
Wizard!

363
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,000
We did it.

364
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
We got rid of it, finally.

365
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,500
Qu expect?

366
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,100
You're a genius.

367
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,700
It is not bad for
the Bobito Simon.

368
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,300
Fabulous, right?

369
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,000
You are Miss Ridgeway, right?

370
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,100
And you, Mrs. Van Schuyler.

371
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
I wondered if you break the ice.

372
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,000
They rarely speak to strangers.

373
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,600
And never with strangers
on their honeymoon.

374
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm glad to break his rule.

375
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,700
The rules are to be broken.

376
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
At least the most,

377
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,100
by m.

378
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,400
They are beautiful.

379
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,200
Thank you.

380
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,600
And amazing,

381
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,500
if you know how to occur.

382
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,200
A tiny grain of sand
enters an oyster,

383
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,200
and eventually becomes
a pearl of great price

384
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,800
that adorns the neck of
a cute nia like you.

385
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,100
I never thought of as.

386
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,800
Shall.

387
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,600
The oyster was almost killed.

388
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,700
We go to the cabin.
It is time for your massage.

389
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,600
My Companions, Bowers.

390
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,400
Pele 15 rounds with
Jack Dempsey once.

391
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,100
l would never be the same.

392
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,100
Excuse me, Miss Ridgeway.

393
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,800
Madam Doyle. Madam Simon Doyle.

394
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,200
Will have to forgive Ms. Bowers.

395
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,600
Do not know the marital status.

396
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,600
I saw dazzled by her pearls.

397
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,700
Cllate.

398
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,300
Dara all his teeth
by owning them.

399
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,100
Slo because you have grudge
rather his father,

400
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,800
-You should not be descorts.
"Grudge?

401
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,400
Ridgeway Melhuish
ruined my family.

402
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Well, you should be grateful.

403
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,100
Otherwise, you will not have the
pleasure of working with me.

404
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,200
Slo may kill her for that.

405
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,900
T, Madam?

406
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,500
Salom Otterbourne and I'm
communicating with you.

407
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,200
Since we communicate
by way of lawyers.

408
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,400
It's about that I have
come to beg ...

409
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,200
"Begging" "lmplorar to
appeal if you like.

410
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,100
The writers we are blooming
in our language.

411
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,900
And defamatory in
their writings.

412
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I feel that has been interpreted

413
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,100
Pasin''Under the persimmon
tree''that way.

414
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,200
Slo The intention was to
show a girl's heart

415
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,100
beating to the beat
of primitive drums.

416
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,500
He does not understand that what
I write was really a compliment?

417
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,100
Frankly, Ms. Otterbourne,

418
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,000
I do not consider the comparacin

419
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,200
with a female baboon ninfmana,
a compliment

420
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,000
and suggest that lawyers decide
the appropriate repair

421
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,600
to be the target of his
vulgar stupidity.

422
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,500
Good afternoon.

423
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,300
Philistia.

424
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,600
We show qu is the reputation.

425
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,700
Sorry to interrupt.

426
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
To Andrew.

427
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,700
Those are the documents

428

To Andrew, I have not Ledo.

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,200
No need. Everything is revised

435
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,100
and twice revised by m.

436
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,900
Always read everything
before signing.

437
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,000
My father taught me.

438
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,400
Deca who did not trust
anyone, or lawyers.

439
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,400
Darling Melhuish.
Qu sense of humor!

For m, Ledo in my life

441
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
and I will not start now.

442
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
Do not say.

443
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,400
"It's a bit irresponsible.-S,

to be the honeymoon.

447
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,700
As is done.

448
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,100
Now the next.

449
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,000
I hope not to intrude.

450
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,600
I am a lawyer and I must say
that I admire your attitude.

451
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,300
His father tena reason.

452
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,800
Never sign a document
without reading it.

453
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,600
Sure agree.

454
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,800
Of course.

455
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,500
Sure, no hurry.

456
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
With permission.

457
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,500
I hope I have not offended.

458
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,200
And if he did, Mr. ...?

459
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,000
-Race. Colonel Race.
- And if so, Colonel?

460
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,800
The lawyers know how
to handle offenses.

461
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,600
"We're riding with the bar?" Thanks.
Very nice.

462
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,700
And you, Mr P.?

463
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,800
There is reason for concluding.

464
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,600
My plan to let Jackie
was a success.

465

a telegram.

Give me the money I promised.

478
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
I've been working five years.

479
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,700
That's crazy.

480
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,000
Madam, you promised me.

By God, How are alienates

Even his own lawyer
tries to cheat?

00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,000
Old fox, you notice?

491
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,800

English lawyers working
for Ms Doyle.

Exactly.

502
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,700
I think this time it scared,
but then har qu?

503
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,800
Not only l, either.

504
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,700
Inside the Great
Temple of Karnak

505
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,800
we went through the stands
of many sheep ...

506
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,200
each with an image of Amenhotep the front.
S.

507
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,200
S, are sheep.

508
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,200
Rams libidinous,
FLIC, Enceladus.

509
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,900
Qu noble son!

510
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,300
With his proud flanks,
large necklaces

511
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,600
and shameless curved horns.

512
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
S, come, madam.

513
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,200
Karl Marx said

514
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,600
that the religion was the
opium of the people.

515
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,900
To his mother is sex.

516
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
Not be better to calm a bit?

517
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,100
May harming these animals.

518
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,200
My mother may be mocked by you,

519
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,100
but it is my mother.

520
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,300
I take good care little better.
Do not stop now ...

521
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,000
"Now that qu" "Nothing.

522
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,600
Sorry.

523
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,300
Did not mean to be impertinent,
much less offend.

524
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,800
Seorita, I'm not as
bad as I look.

525
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,200
"No?" Word of honor.

526
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,000
I bothered to offend her?

527
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,400
Linnet Ridgeway is a crab.

528
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,400
A Parsitan of society.

529
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,900
In a perfect world, was killed
as a warning to dems.

530
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,200
"The killed?" That said.

531
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,600
-Sr. ... "Jim Ferguson.

532
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,000
Jim, you can defame the dead?

533
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,300
I do not understand
the question.

534
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,800
It does not matter.

535
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,100
Is not it wonderful?
Ms all of any comprehension.

536
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,500
Temperament artistic, Mr.
Pennington.

537
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,600
Qu takes such e
traordinary ways!

538
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,300
I hope this does not concern me, Mr.
Poirot.

539
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,300
I limit myself to the world
of facts and figures.

540
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,700
The ancient Egyptians knew
facts and figures.

541
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,200
The Grand Vizier Ptahotep,

542
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,400
for example, was crushed under
a thousand pieces of silver

543
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,800
for embezzling the fortunes
of his master.

544
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,700
"I say." As it was.

545
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,200
By God!

546
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,600
Ests right?

547
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,300
Linnet, ESTs right?

548
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,600
Ven. Slowly.

549
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,800
Slowly. Levntate.

550
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,700
Ests right?

551
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,800
Qu pas?

552
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,500
That rock must have
fallen or pushed.

553
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,000
To kill me?

554
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,300
Jackie!

555
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,900
But she is not here.

556
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,700
By God, Madam, was
in grave danger.

557
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,700
Might be a horrible accident.

558
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That rock was 4000 years ah

559
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,600
cay and accurate when bean people down.
No.

560
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,500
Not exactly 4000 years,
Mr Poirot.

561
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,900
The columns were built
in 1788 AC ...

562
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,000
Okay, but has a patient
who attend.

563
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,100
Qu neglect the ma!

564
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,700
"Now ..." I'm fine. Really.

565
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,700
It is better to return to the
ship and rest a while.

566
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,100
Est good.

567
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,200
But only a couple
of hours, Doctor.

568
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,000
I visit the Temple of
Abu Simbel tonight.

569
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,200
It's extraordinary.

570
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,400
The figure of the eastern end
is the famous statue vocal.

571
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,500
- Really?-S.

572
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,800
We arrive on time.
Thank you, Doctor.

573
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,500
At dusk beeps sad and mournful.

574
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,500
-L scares me. "It's harmless.

575
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,400
By God! Fantstico Son!

576
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,600
I find frightening.

577
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,200
They are not.

578
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,800
Think that song for me?

579
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,600
Why not? You are divine.

580
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,900
Welcome to the Temple
of Abu Simbel.

581
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,400
The facade is 25 m longiud.

582
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,900
Each of the statues of Ramss ll

583
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,900
is 20 m high.

584
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,900
Aljate m!

585
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,100
Go!

586
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,000
Aljate m!

587
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,900
Carlo!

588
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,900
She can not ruin everything.

589
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,100
He could not bury their dead.

590
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,800
You can not get away.

591
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,200
No, I can not get away.

592
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,100
Not believe that Simon
tricks cheating me.

593
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,800
I'm sorry to see it
here, seorita.

594
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,900
Disclpeme to say,

595
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,400
but embarks on a dangerous
journey in rough seas

596
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,600
to deal with unfortunately
current unknown.

597
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,500
"Why do you say?" Because
it's the truth.

598
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,900
ECENT Cut the ties that
bind it to safety.

599
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,100
An can repent, if
you really want.

600
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,200
We must continue our
star where we carry.

601
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,800
Even the disaster?

602
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,500
Even in hell itself.

603
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,400
"I forgot my purse.
Be right back. "Well.

604
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,700
Well ...

605
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,700
We are alone, friend of mine.

606
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,300
Bean had no opportunity to
speak with you privately.

607
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,500
From what we have to talk?

608
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,200
From my repute, Madam Doyle.

609
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,700
-Directs the institute in Zurich.
"As is.

610
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,800
And you've said many nasty
things about me

611
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,900
influential people and POSITION.

612
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,500
"I say that is a fake.-Mrs.
Doyle!

613
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,100
"A dangerous fake." Esccheme.

614
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,100
My friend Myra Seligman
heard him too well.

615
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,800
Le dej apply those
horrible shots.

616
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,300
We developed a urine
treatment armadillo.

617
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,000
S. Bean used before
with great success.

618
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,700
In the case of Myra, went mad.
Thank you.

619
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Do not allow this.

620
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,800
Your comments about my treatment
can not continue.

621
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,900
Demndeme, if you dare.

622
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
He knows that is impossible.

623
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,100
One of my clinically escndalo

624
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,800
mean ruin.

625
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,300
Then be his funeral.

626
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,000
Well, hopefully not yours.

627
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,500
Want a chocolate cream
or coercion, maybe?

628
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,400
The above service is very slow.

629
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,600
No, thanks.

630
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,500
Qu time?

631
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,200
Ah there is a clock.
Use your eyes.

632
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,000
Your mother taught you
that the servants

633
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:53,900
difference is the eccentricity
of the impolite?

634
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,800
"My mother was a lady." Quality
that did not inherit.

635
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,100
Bedtime.

636
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,000
Good. Where to est my stole?

637
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,700
I have not seen.

638
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,900
"Sure the tena?" Of course s.

639
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,700
I have not seen.

640
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,300
Use your eyes.

641
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,000
Mr. Poirot.

642
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,300
I hope that one day

643
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,200
can tell some of their cases,

644
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,700
the more juicy.

645
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,900
"The more juicy?"
The more bloody.

646
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,400
When you wish, Madam.

647
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,100
"Good evening, Ser."
Good evening.

648
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,100
"Excuse me." Do not worry.

649
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,900
It looks very sooliento
tonight, Mr Porridge.

650
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,100
S, I have a lot ...

651
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,000
The dream overwhelms me.
S why would not I can hardly

652
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,300
keep your eyes open.

653
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,400
Fool. Neither do I.

654
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,200
May accompany up to my cabin?

655
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,800
For here, as you know.

656
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,900
I suppose this little rough and
trying to seduce you arrive.

657
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,600
Do not leave without at least
give a semblance of fight.

658
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,200
The persecution is
very important.

659
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,700
Mother!

660
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
No, here is better.

661
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,900
There is a dangerous escaln.
Always stumble.

662
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,600
No. it is the ro.

663
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,200
The old est Nile
restless tonight.

664
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,200
That's right.
There are disturbing trends.

665
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,100
Here we are.

666
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,200
No, no. Adentro.

667
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,100
"Good evening." Good
evening, Madam.

668
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,000
Hello.

669
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,800
"You were on the ground?-S.
The moon is beautiful.

670
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
A night of honeymoon.

671
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,500
If the daughter of slo
clrigo drink water,

672
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,500
finished safely in Geneva.

673
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,600
A diamond.

674
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,900
"Simon, we're waiting."
Excuse me.

675
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,000
It's your turn.

676
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,300
"Double." Qu?

677
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,300
He was her man

678
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,800
but he Háqqah wrong.

679
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,600
I accompanied?

680
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,800
No, thanks.

681
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,500
You can repeat your bet?

682
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,800
Excuse me.

683
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,500
If the main season of the vicar
has not touched liquor

684
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,100
expect to find the champagne.

685
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,700
White Background.

686
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,400
Sorry, Carian, was not thinking.

687
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
They swore to be faithful
to each other ...

688
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,700
I fear that we won.

689
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,000
I go to sleep.

690
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,700
It's bedtime.

691
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,000
I second the idea.

692
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,000
Good night.

693
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,000
That bed bugs do not bite!

694
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,000
- Vienna, Simon? "No slow.
Pick up a little.

695
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,400
"Good evening." Good evening.

696
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,800
"It's late.
I lie. "No, come on, syntactic.

697
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,100
Cuntame you.

698
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,900
I have not much to tell, really.

699
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,200
I am the daughter of
Otterbourne Salom.

700
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,900
If the wife of a God who
has never touched wine,

701
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,700
can bet to finish in whiskey.

702
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,800
More. Were ...

703
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,000
saying something about
someone's daughter.

704
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,800
In Salom Otterbourne,
the novelist.

705
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,200
Salom?

706
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,600
It did him behead a man?

707
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,400
Must happen to someone I know.

708
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,200
"Enough." Enough qu?

709
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,500
"Liquor." Liquor.

710
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,700
Perhaps your business?

711
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,700
"I guess not." Right.

712
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,700
Qu going, Simon? Ests scared?

713
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
"Afraid of qu?-Scared ...

714
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,200
that this lady tell the
story of my life.

715
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,900
S Now I must go.

716
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,200
No, wait.

717
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,800
It is a very sad story.

718
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,500
As a three-hanky, if
you're sentimental.

719
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,200
For the love of God, Jackie.

720
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,600
Qu?

721
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,600
Go to sleep and stop doing
the ridiculous.

722
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,100
''Simon says''I'm doing
the ridiculous.

723
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,600
Simon says ... I go to sleep.

724
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,400
Sleep.

725
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,500
T're disgusting!

726
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,800
Go to sleep!

727
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,300
As I can try!

728
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,700
Listen, Jackie!

729
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,000
Kill you first!

730
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,300
Jackie!

731
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,000
Quickly. Aydelo.

732
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,400
"By God." Heavens!

733
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,700
Bring to Dr. Bessner.

734
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,400
Llvela to his cabin.
Tranquilcela.

735
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,000
Qu did?

736
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,100
The seorita Bowers
is a nurse, right?

737
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,800
PDAL to look after her.

738
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,300
Come.

739
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,300
Simon ...

740
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,300
That it is not alone.

741
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:05,600
Then look at health
surveillance.

742
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:06,900
Quickly.

743
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,900
Acustese.

744
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,300
Bring to Ms. Bowers.

745
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,400
"Simon!" Relax.

746
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,200
Rosalie was by Ms.
Bowers.
She is a nurse. She's caring.

747
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,600
Take too long.

748
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,400
Ms. Bowers is bean bed. Coming.

749
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,700
"Between ms sooner the
better." How est?

750
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,700
How you can stay after
shooting his ex-lover?

751
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,000
How can he be so heartless?

752
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,600
Quiet. Here comes Ms. Bowers.

753
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,400
Estars well.

754
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:09,900
Estars well.

755
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,700
This is Doyle.
There was an accident ...

756
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,500
S. Ms. Otterbourne inform me.

757
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,900
I believe that an injection
of morphine calm.

758
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:25,100
It is effective if Mrs.
Van Schuyler gets nervous.

759
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,000
Ferguson, call Alemán health
surveillance in next door.

760
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,900
-PDAL that meets
Doyle.-S, right.

761
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,800
This looks bad.
Get another napkin.

762
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,000
Quiet.

763
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,700
The bones are broken.
There are many losses of blood.

764
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,500
Est good.

765
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,300
Aydemir take him to my cabin.

766
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,000
I'm afraid of blood

767
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,700
as a woman?

768
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,600
Mr. Ferguson, Aydemir a lift.

769
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,900
I stay with her tonight.

770
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,700
We do not know how to react.

771
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,200
-Ms. Bowers, est bien? "As is.

772
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,500
I applied morphine.

773
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,900
Do not be left alone.

774
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,200
Good.

775
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,400
Young girl, come with me.

776
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,900
Be more useful than this fool
who is afraid of blood.

777
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,600
Open my door.

778
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,100
As, slowly. Care. Very good.

779
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,000
We're fine.'re Almost there.

780
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:00,900
Very good.

781
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,500
Get a towel for the head fra, s?

782
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,000
S, Doctor.

783
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,400
Search the revlver.

784
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,000
There should be at ah, right?

785
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,700
-S.-S.

786
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,900
Jackie.

787
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,900
It should not be alone.

788
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,800
It is not alone. Do not worry.

789
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,600
For God's sake, everything
has been blamed ma.

790
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,600
The treated badly.

791
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,300
Saba not what Háqqah.
She was drunk.

792
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,600
That hurt.

793
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,900
Not be better tell your wife?

794
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,500
S.

795
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,300
S, please.

796
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,500
No, Djel sleep.

797
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,300
Do not worry until tomorrow.

798
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
The best I can do is sew.

799
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,800
There is no exit wound.

800
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,000
The bullet embedded est.

801
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,300
There will have to wait
to get to Wadi Halfa.

802
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,600
Sbale sleeve.

803

Lmpielo with this.

804
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,100
Ask splints

805
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,600
and then splinting

806
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,500
when he is asleep.

807
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:30,900
Thank you, Doctor.

808
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,700
Now, do not worry.

809
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,200
Everything will be fine.

810
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,300
It is not.

811
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,300
Qu?

812
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,200
The weapon, he is not.

813
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,700
Quin can have it?

814
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,700
Esclqueme.
I hope it is not important.

815
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,000
Sometimes''

816
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,900
I put this on his head revlver

817
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:06,400
AFTER and slowly pull
the trigger.''

818
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,600
Qu?

819
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,100
Nothing.

820
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,700
Speak to the manager.
I am in charge of the case.

821
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,400
We will be responsible
until reaching port.

822
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,600
"I am at your disposal." Thanks.

823
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,100
What can I say about this?

824
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,400
He was shot with a
bullet very minor,

825
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,800
22 gauge, I think.

826
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,100
The revlver was near the head.

827
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,800
Here we can see the whole
versengen''.''

828
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,700
Curse, unable to speak Inglês?

"It means scorching.-S,
singeing.

Excuse ...

01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,500
Well, well ...

-Qu conclude, then? "Qu?

I think it's CFLI.

834
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,900
Ms. Doyle was dying.

835
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,600
Quera for us to identify
the murderer.

836
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,000
Unt finger with his own blood

837
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,200
and''J''wrote on the wall.
Jacqueline.

838
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,500
What he says is stupid.

839
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,400
She died instantneamente.

840
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,600
"Really?-S. No time to write.

841
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,000
No.

842
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,500
It was a joke?

843
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,800
Very small and not very
good taste, I fear.

844
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,100
But the''J''est on the wall.
We have to explain qu.

845
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,700
Cândido melodramtico
is a gesture.

846
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,700
Cul is the hour of death?

847
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,900
Been dead at least six hours

848
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,400
and no more than eight.

849
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,600
That is, between 12
and as two o'clock.

850
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,200
"Which is extraordinary." Why?

851
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,600
Because it means that Ms.
Jacqueline

852
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,100
could not.

853
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,300
T told me yourself, Colonel,

854
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,800
that Ms.
Doyle went out of the living
room shortly before 11:45

855
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,400
to go to bed.

856
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,700
Since then,

857
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:13,700
Jackie was in sight of Ms.
Murray and Mr. Doyle

858
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,700
or Mr. Ferguson and Ms. Bowers,

859
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,900
he was injected with morphine

860
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,400
and accompanied in his
cabin all night.

861
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,900
Simon Doyle is ruled out because
of his broken leg.

862
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,100
I guess not pruning
walking wounded?

863
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,200
Not one step, I assure you.

864
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,300
Great!
DISPOSAL eyelet process
as follow.

865
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,800
I am afraid not, Colonel.

866
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,300
Almost everyone in this boat

867
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,600
Why saban hated Miss
Ms Jackie Doyle.

868
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:46,000
It was precisely the person
for confabulacin''.''

869
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,700
At least, Mr, you can
not suspect m.

870
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,900
Why not?

871
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,800
Tena a motive to kill her, according
to I discovered last night.

872
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,900
Then s listening.

873
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,300
But it was not a cause.
Habra could sue.

874
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,600
And risk the ruin?
Murder is more expensive.

875
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,000
And safest, if not discovered.

876
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,900
"But as something can
be done." I disagree.

877
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,500
At the time of the shooting to Mr.
Doyle,

878
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,400
you might be on deck

879
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,700
quiz suffering from insomnia.

880
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,900
Voices could have odo,

881
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,000
look out the living room window

882
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,800
and see what happens.

883
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:28,900
Go to sleep!

884
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,700
As I can try!

885
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,200
Listen, Jackie!

886
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,100
Kill you first!

887
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,600
Jackie!

888
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,600
He could remember the position
of the revlver.

889
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,800
Then, when he was called
from his cabin

890
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,200
could collect revlver

891
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
Heed while Mr. Doyle.

892
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,200
Ms later, when all was quiet

893
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:57,700
could leave the cabin without
his patient's knowledge,

894
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,500
go to the cabin of Mrs. Doyle

895
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,500
and kill her.

896
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,500
No, Doctor, I can not dismiss.

897
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,400
What it suggests is
ubermssig''.''

898
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,000
lnjurioso, s.

899
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,500
I'm not here to be insulted.

900
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,400
Find anything in glaze?

901
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:59,200
Not catch flies with vinegar.

902
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:02,000
"Qu said?" An old proverb francs

903
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:05,300
too long to explain.

904
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,100
Preparmonos for investigation

905
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,700
Customer justifying it.

906
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,000
How long pas, according
to their clculos,

907
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,400
between the time you
and the Doctor

908
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:22,300
removed Mr. Doyle's living room

909
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,200
and when he came back
to find the revlver?

910
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,900
"About three or four minutes."
Three or four minutes.

911
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,800
You were next to the living
room when the shot oy.

912
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,100
It could be entirely
possible that you

913
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,800
notice the position
of the revlver.

914
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,800
Agreed. Totally possible.

915
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,400
Also entirely possible that you

916
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,700
wait until the salon
was emptiness,

917
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,000
it removed the revlver

918
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,000
and AFTER you say no bean found.

919
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,300
Yluego, before reporting to Dr.
Bessner of prdida,

920
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,000
use it to kill Ms. Doyle.

921
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,000
I could have done all
that, but I did not.

922
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,500
And you, seorita,

923
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,500
revlver could pick up
before leaving here

924
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:18,000
while Mr.
Ferguson attend to Mr. Doyle.

925
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,300
-Lr by Ms. Bowers. "Well.

926
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,200
When he went to find Ms. Bowers,

927
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,800
could pass through the cabin of Mrs.
Doyle

928
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:43,800
and murder.

929
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,900
A minute or two ms of delay.

930
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,600
Miss Bowers, wake up.
Seorita Bowers.

931
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,500
What will happen?

932
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,600
Come, please.
There was an accident.

933
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,500
Why we had to take it?

934
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,300
Tenamos no reason to kill.

935
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,400
But it was''a crab,

936
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:14,200
a Parsitan in the
skin of society''

937
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,600
it deserves to be killed.

938
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,900
-S, but ...-S, she was killed

939
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,000
as an example for the dems.

940
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,000
Nasty Spanish francs.

941
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,500
Belga, Belgian space,
please lord.

942
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,900
And you, seorita,

943
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,600
was anxious to avoid major
damage to his mother.

944
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,800
I may not have done that.

945
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,800
He consulted two days ago.
Was the reply.

946
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,800
You're right, seorita,

947
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:43,100
you can not defame the dead.

948
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,900
You are horrible.

949
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:50,000
Pretend to be nice and respectful
yslo intended deceive.

950
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,100
I find what he is
hiding, seorita.

951
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,400
The truth.

952
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,900
AFTER giving her the morphine
to Miss Jackie,

953
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,500
"She did not move
at all?" Exactly.

954
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,600
Reaccin nervosa, alcohol
and morphine together.

955
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,400
Have sunk the Titanic.

956
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,200
Undoubtedly it could
not be the killer?

957
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,300
No, no way.

958
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,600
But you may s.

959
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:20,900
I?

960
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,800
S, you seorita.

961
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,700
Suppose I was on deck
when they fired.

962
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,400
Saw what was happening

963
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,500
and learned in the revlver
Where to qued.

964
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,300
Young girl, come with me.

965
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,700
Be more useful than this fool

966
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,300
who is afraid of blood.

967
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,400
While Mr.
Ferguson and Ms. Rosalie

968
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,500
helped Dr. Bessner,

969
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,200
he could leave his patient
and go up the gun.

970
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,700
Had enough time

971
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,700
before Mr.
Ferguson returned to find him.

972
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,600
Port could go down to the cabin of Mrs.
Doyle

973
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,500
and murder.

974
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,700
It's absurd.

975
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,500
Why kill Mrs. Doyle?

976
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,200
Because his father was
Melhuish Ridgeway,

977
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,700
unscrupulous dealings which
ruined his father

978
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,500
and condemned to a
life of servant.

979
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,000
Nonsense.

980
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:33,600
Quin said that?

981
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,200
You yourself, seorita
makes three days.

982
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,300
How dare listen to a private
conversation?

983
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,400
Some voices are heard from afar.

984
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:43,800
Is that true?

985
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,100
S.

986
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:49,900
Ve?

987
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:54,100
Why would kill her for something
that happened years ago?

988
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:58,900
It still suffers because
its effects deeply.

989
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,200
No, seorita unfortunately

990
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,800
I am not convinced
their protests.

991
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:08,300
Tena means, motive, opportunity,
and what is more,

992
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,000
the disposal to kill.

993
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,300
I finished, Mr. Poirot?

994
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,500
For the moment,

995
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,600
but ms preprese to answer
questions if necessary.

996
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,300
I will start.

997
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,900
Poirot Lord ...

998
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,500
It is true about Linnet?

999
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,800
Absolutely true.

1000
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,400
I do not mat.

1001
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,800
S we all believe, but I did not.

1002
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,300
Quiet, seorita.

1003
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,200
We know that it was ace.
We have evidence.

1004
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,400
-Tests. "Thank God.

1005
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,600
But Simon, est bien?

1006
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,300
The Doctor seems satisfied
with her condition.

1007
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,200
It was crazy last night.
I could have killed him.

1008
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,600
Thinking I forgive?

1009
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,300
It is very probable.

1010
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,000
S that men are less Enticed

1011
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,600
to women who treat them well.

1012
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:14,200
Miss Bowers, acompela
to his cabin.

1013
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:19,300
Ms afternoon take a visit.

1014
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,200
Thank you.

1015
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,400
I think we should visit first.

1016
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,200
He must be awake.

1017
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,700
Good idea.

1018
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,100
What more ...

1019
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,100
confuses me is the revlver case.

1020
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,400
"The gun?" Disappeared Why?

1021
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,900
I do not understand the importance.
In many cases this happens.

1022
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:01,400
Even when attempting confabulacin?
No.

1023
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,600
Why taking the trouble

1024
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,200
J''''writing on the
wall with blood

1025
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,400
and then hid the
revlver of''J''?

1026
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,200
I understand what you say.
They found something.

1027
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,300
One thing is certain:

1028
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,200
Mrs Doyle mat not a fish.

1029
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,800
Est good?-S, thanks.

1030
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,500
Deb lost consciousness.

1031
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,800
Eat something. We give strength.

1032
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,800
Thanks. Do not want to see food.

1033
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,600
Do not want to see?

1034
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,900
-I? "Please. Go ahead.

1035
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,800
I can not believe it.

1036
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,000
Linnet est dead.

1037
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,400
It is a hard blow.

1038
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:32,000
I guess that Jackie
is quite dicult,

1039
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,400
but it s not as commit a murder.

1040
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,300
Rest assured, Ser.

1041
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,900
We know that it was Miss Jackie.

1042
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,600
Thank God.

1043
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,100
Any idea of who might be?

1044
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,200
Well, almost anyone.

1045
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,100
Yesterday, she said

1046
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,100
all in this boat were
his enemies.

1047
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,700
We have reason to believe
that he was right.

1048
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,700
Lord ...

1049
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,100
Sorry.

1050
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,800
I came to see if it
was easier for you.

1051
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,200
So ease in as I can.
Thanks, Louise.

1052
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,000
You find the body.

1053
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,400
Quiz can give us some light.

1054
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,900
Sorry ...

1055
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:24,200
Est accusing me?
At a respectable young man?

1056
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:27,500
"I swear by my dead mother
..." Hush, Louise.

1057
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:31,000
No stories.
You have to tell the truth.

1058
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:32,800
Syntactic.

1059
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,900
Lord detective, Cramer.

1060
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:42,800
A poor Mrs.
Doyle all loved her. It was ...

1061
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:47,000
He was young, beautiful.
No one will want to kill her.

1062
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,400
Louise, that's not true.
Lncluyndote ...

1063
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,200
They may talk about something
that we all understand?

1064
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,200
He says that everyone loved to Ms.
Doyle.

1065
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,100
At least it is something new.

1066
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,900
Cundo Mrs. Doyle was alive?

1067
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,200
Last night, Mr.

1068
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,100
I was in his cabin, ayudndola
to undress.

1069
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,200
AND AFTER adnde was?

1070
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,400
In my cabin. Adnde ms?

1071
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,800
And there was not anything
that can help oy?

1072
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,100
How, Lord?

1073
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,500
My cabin is on the other
side of the boat.

1074
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:25,000
Of course, if you
could not sleep,

1075
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:27,400
if he had gone to the roof

1076
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,600
Perhaps it would have
been the murderer

1077
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,300
enter and exit the
cabin of the Lord.

1078
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,900
But as was ...

1079
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,700
Lord, please understand
my situation.

1080
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,300
"I can say what else?" Nobody
accuses you of anything.

1081
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,800
Do not worry, Louise.
I will protect.

1082
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,900
"The lord is good." But ...

1083
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:53,400
If it had not returned after
leaving the cabin,

1084
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,300
would have had time

1085
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,400
to witness the agresin Mr.
Doyle in the living room.

1086
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,800
-No.-S.

1087
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,900
Would have been able to walk
on deck, see everything

1088
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,400
and in a timely manner,
collect revlver,

1089
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,300
back ...

1090
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,700
and kill Ms. Doyle.

1091
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,800
Lord, I am accused unjustly.

1092
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,200
Why do something so bad?
Contsteme.

1093
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,600
Louise ...

1094
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,400
S all of you,

1095
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,800
Your romance

1096
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,700
and Ms Doyle oposicin when
you wanted to go.

1097
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,400
But I have no money
and no references.

1098
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,400
My only option was to stay.

1099
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,700
Precisely. The hated that.

1100
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,400
But the mat.

1101
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,700
One last question, Louise.

1102
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,000
In Where are the pearls of Mrs.
Doyle?

1103
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,200
Their pearls?

1104
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,300
The tena made last night.

1105
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,500
The leave in the table
next to her bed.

1106
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,900
Ah were in the morning?

1107
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,500
By God! Even mir.

1108
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,900
I went to bed, I saw the Lord,

1109
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,900
grit and salt ran
out of the cabin.

1110
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,300
Not even looked!

1111
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:13,100
But I, Hercule Poirot, I have
eyes to notice it all.

1112
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,200
Pearls were not on the
table this morning.

1113
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:19,100
Had experienced evaporated

1114
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,000
vanished.

1115
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,100
Disappeared.

1116
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:41,000
"We must find the revlver."
And the pearls.

1117
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,000
S. That should not
be very dicult.

1118
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,600
It's hot.

1119
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,900
You are right.
Lr to change my shirt.

1120
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,800
Let us pause to refresh.

1121
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,800
And rest to small cells; gray.

1122
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,100
Since we last met.

1123
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:52,000
I thank you for the
very timely rescue.

1124
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,500
It was a pleasure. Or your SOS.

1125
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,400
"You think he went to purposes
upon?" Certainly.

1126
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,900
But a simple snake will not
stop the investigation ...

1127
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,700
Hercule Poirot.

1128
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:07,800
How is the research?

1129
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:10,900
With intelligence and discrecin?

1130
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,300
"No one to fifteen to wives?"
It still does not.

1131
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:21,800
There are all dead cobra.

1132
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,500
Hgame the favor of removing it.
Thank you.

1133
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,200
Come Race.

1134
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,000
A cobra? No way!

1135
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:33,400
Bean never seen a snake
in a cabin first.

1136
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,000
Jams.

1137
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,100
Quin's next?
Pennington? Know how is it.

1138
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,600
He's a menace.

1139
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,900
Poirot Lord, I presume?

1140
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,400
Disclpenos, Madam.

1141
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Quiz allow the accom.

1142
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,200
Of course.

1143
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
"Well?-Est with Mrs. Doyle?

1144
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:37,400
-As is.
"Heard something strange
last night?

1145
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,600
Of course I have a dream
lightweight s.

1146
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:44,300
and I woke up something
like a pop.

1147
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,000
A burst?

1148
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,900
S. Like a champagne
cork as it exits.

1149
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,900
A champagne common, clear est

1150
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,100
not a great harvest.

1151
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,200
're making a noise much
more discreet.

1152
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:03,300
It could have been a weapon
pequeay not a cork?

1153
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,900
Very possibly.

1154
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,900
But must take into account

1155
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:11,100
my limited knowledge
of firearms.

1156
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:19,900
We found him.

1157
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,100
We found it! Qu good!

1158
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,700
Qu wonderful success!

1159
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,800
The hump of the camel.

1160
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,100
And without a misguidance.

1161
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:33,900
Lord!

1162
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,200
Lord, I am sure that we
find what they seek.

1163
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
"Thanks.
Mr. Chowdhury. "Willingly.

1164
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,200
Without doubt, the weapon
of Miss Jackie.

1165
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,100
A new 22 Derringer.

1166
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,700
"Four shots." Two bullets fired.

1167
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,300
A tissue of man. It seems blood.

1168
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:09,700
An ashtray mrmol to sink.

1169
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,300
And I stole.

1170
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:13,600
It's yours, madam?

1171
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:17,000
Sure, it's ma.
The loss last night
at the salon.

1172
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:21,900
The murderer wrapped revlver
to dampen noise.

1173
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,700
Qu impertinence!
"The crown prince Carol

1174
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,900
I stole this regal in Romania.

1175
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:31,400
People have no respect for
property from others.

1176
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:34,500
Not for the gems from others.

1177
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,900
A qu concerns, Mr?

1178
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,500
I refer to pearls
Potsdam, Madam,

1179
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,900
that they belonged to Ms.
Doyle and were stolen.

1180
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,300
Stolen?

1181
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,700
Birla.

1182
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,200
Stolen.

1183
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,500
Stolen.

1184
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,300
And look at me qu

1185
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,100
with that known expresin
continental?

1186
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,900
How pearls are related to me?

1187
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:06,900
I am the ugly space
intruder, my Lord.

1188
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,800
Or that he greatly admired
the pearls, which give

1189
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:14,000
''All his teeth by
owning them.''

1190
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:16,500
Bowers Damn!

1191
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,500
My Teora is that you have an
obsessive love for jewelry,

1192
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,500
they coveted the jewels of Mrs.
Doyle

1193
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,600
and was determined to possess

1194
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:27,800
even by theft

1195
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:31,100
o. .. the murder.

1196
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,800
Do not deny it, madam?

1197
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:37,300
I imagine her walking on the
deck yesterday evening,

1198
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,400
waiting for Ms. Doyle to sleep.

1199
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:41,700
Go to sleep.!

1200
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,800
By chance, see what
the living room.

1201
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,000
Listen, Jackie.!

1202
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,700
Kill you first.!

1203
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,000
Jackie.!

1204
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:50,900
By being vacuum the living room,

1205
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:53,500
advantage to take the gun.

1206
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,600
Go to the cabin of Mrs. Doyle

1207
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,300
knowing that their
husbands will be.

1208
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,500
He shoots

1209
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:11,900
and then steals the pearls
from her bedside table.

1210
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,600
Remove your words

1211
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,900
or sue for libel with
the utmost vigor.

1212
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,200
Not even the force

1213
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,600
to which register this boat

1214
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,900
especially his cabin, looking
for those pearls.

1215
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,600
I wish you a great evening.

1216
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:32,200
Totally obnoxious
upstart francs.

1217
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,800
Belga, please, Madam.

1218
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,500
You should be so rude
to the lady?

1219
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,700
"You seem to acknowledge them
all." With reason, Colonel.

1220
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,200
Think the elderly do not kill?

1221
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,200
Sure it has the pearls.

1222
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:51,300
The question is,
mat to get them?

1223
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,500
Chowdhury Lord!

1224
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:54,200
Suerte.

1225
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,400
"Colonel?" We sail immediately.

1226
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,700
I have already given the order.

1227
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,300
At this time the Engineers
stokes the boiler.

1228
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,400
Hurry?

1229
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:08,700
Dude, I feel the presence
of evil around me.

1230
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,600
The sooner we reach Wadi
Halfa, the better.

1231
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,500
Keep this in safety.

1232
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,400
Began The search for pearls.

1233
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:31,500
It is the last cabin.
Perhaps the bot overboard.

1234
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,100
You forget that we lack
the cabin Pennington.

1235
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,400
Revismoslo now.

1236
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:40,200
Hello, guys!

1237
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,400
Our trip Cont.

1238
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,100
Good afternoon, Madam.

1239
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,400
I accompanied with a drink?

1240
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:49,000
This wonderful young

1241
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,500
just prepare for the 
xtraordinary mixture ms

1242
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,700
native fruit juice.
Sebek is called Golden

1243
01:33:55,900 --> 01:34:00,000
in honor of the God of the ancient
city of Cocodrilpolis.

1244
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:01,900
For me no thanks.

1245
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,500
I pluck the hair of the dog,
but not scale the crocodile.

1246
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,500
Race ...

1247
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,200
How is going with
its investigation

1248
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,000
tragically this event, Mr.
Porridge?

1249
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,400
Normally, as they say, Madam.

1250
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,500
The crime of passion,

1251
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:20,100
primitive instinct to kill,

1252
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,800
as related to the
sexual instinct.

1253
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,200
I feel compassion for the
poor alienated Jackie,

1254
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,400
altered emotions,

1255
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:31,300
Latin blood boiling

1256
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,500
wanting revenge on who
would rob her man.

1257
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,700
S, of course, but could
be someone else

1258
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,100
with good reason too.

1259
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:42,300
Quin?

1260
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,200
You, Mrs. Otterbourne.

1261
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,600
"Qu said?" Oh, your daughter
and you know

1262
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,500
not defame the dead.

1263
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,600
No longer have to pay the
claim for damages.

1264
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:57,600
-S, but not kill for that. "No?

1265
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,000
Another of those things golden.

1266
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,000
Mrs Otterbourne ...

1267
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,400
I see her looking in the living
room, among the windows

1268
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,000
to that, as you say,

1269
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,900
alienated poor Jackie,
disparndole Mr Doyle.

1270
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,500
Yluego, when everyone left,

1271
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,600
going to pick up the revlver

1272
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:27,000
and AFTER going quietly to kill Ms.
Doyle.

1273
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,400
No! My world is the love,
romance Pasinya,

1274
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,100
not murder.

1275
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,100
Now, Jem quiet.

1276
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:37,700
If we bothered, both sorry.

1277
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,700
Life can be so cruel!

1278
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,600
It takes courage to face
the slander of life.

1279
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:47,900
Bartender!

1280
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,000
This croc lost its scales.

1281
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,300
Qu woman so annoying!

1282
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,500
Why not kill, I wonder?

1283
01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:00,400
Quiz algnda subscribers
libraries

1284
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:03,000
together and hire a murderer.

1285
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:33,400
Mrs. Van Schuyler is so stupid

1286
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:36,200
he wants to play Hercule Poirot.

1287
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,800
You know you have no evidence
that the rob her?

1288
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,200
The pearl devolucin
not mean jams

1289
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,200
mat not to steal them initially.

1290
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,000
Pennington?

1291
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,400
We tried to find the document

1292
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,800
to sign on to Ms. Doyle.

1293
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:23,700
Qu's this?

1294
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:25,600
"Poirot." S?

1295
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:30,300
Miss Jackie was not the unique
passenger traveling armed.

1296
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,200
It was not that mat to Linnet.

1297
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,900
Obviously not.

1298
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,700
Qu mess!

1299
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:46,100
T look better. Dime.

1300
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:51,800
Qu hell is going on?

1301
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,500
We check your private documents, Ser.
Is not it obvious?

1302
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:57,400
They do qu?

1303
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:02,300
Perhaps it Pars requisition in the affairs
of others, but we're not in Paris.

1304
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:03,800
Brussels, Mr ...

1305
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,600
I do not care if Borneo.

1306
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,200
They have no right to be here.

1307
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,500
We have every right.
While waiting for the Police,

1308
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:15,200
the Compaa we handle
the investigation.

1309
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,800
Do not have to do with
my documents.

1310
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:21,400
They prove that, despite the marriage of Ms.
Doyle,

1311
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,400
It still tried to control
your money.

1312
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,700
Y qu?
There is no law that prohba.

1313
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,100
The scam is against customers

1314
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,600
and we do not like
to be infringed.

1315
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,400
Yours? Quines?

1316
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:38,000
The English lawyers of Ms.
Doyle.

1317
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,500
We are not satisfied
with how do you

1318
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,100
and his partner manage
their affairs.

1319
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,200
"Vyasa to hell!" One moment.

1320
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:48,200
"Everything is in perfect order."
I wish it were true.

1321
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:52,200
But I think it came to
signing this power

1322
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,500
and failed.

1323
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:56,600
It was, then, the
Temple of Amun.

Climb to the top of
the pillar ms high.

and, recently, the kills.

1327
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,000
You can not blame that.

1328
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,400
Get out of here!
Longer sufficient or trash.

"Order a new bottle." Why?

Of course.

1391

I can sit down?

1392
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,100
Poirot, in my view it
all could do it.

1393
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,400
All tenan a reason to do so.

1394
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:39,700
It's incredible.

1395
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,800
Absolutely.

1396
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,600
Good night.

1397

Good evening, Madam. Please ...

You know qu is it?

01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:09,500
Money.

1403
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,900
It looks like a piece of
thousand-franc note.

1404
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:13,400
It must be blackmail.

1405
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,700
Saba something the murderer
of Linnet Doyle.

1406

The saba.

Qu said this afternoon?

1409
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,800

Quiz''had seen the murderer

1412
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,700
entering or exiting the
cabin of Doyle Madam.''

1413
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,700
That's what happened.
He saw the murderer.

1414
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,700
And because of their greed,
now he is dead.

1415
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,100
How does that help us?

1416
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:53,300
An quin we do not know the mat.

1417
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:55,500
No. That's not exactly true.

1418
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,200
we were in the wrong
address, you and me.

1419
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,200
We know almost everything
there is to know.

1420
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,400
But what we think ...

1421
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,500
seems incredible.

1422
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:13,400
Impossible.

1423
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,100
Assassinations.

1424
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,500
Murder!

1425
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,900
All the time killing.

With a thin knife.

1429
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:41,700
Like this one.

1430
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,100
Very interesting, Doctor.

1431
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,300
Sure any of his absence?

1432
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:48,800
Qu?

1433
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:54,200
Then think I, Ludwig Bessner,

sculpture with matters
of the lower classes?

1438

"Take the body to the
room fro.-S, Ser.

1441

You think you know.

1442
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:25,300
I confess that I
have no clarity.

1443
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,400
Dr. Bessner told me what
happened with the maid.

1444
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:32,200
I talk to you and Mr
Doyle immediately.

1445
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,700
I do not enter.
Dr. Bessner est upset.

Who knows quin mat to Louise?

1452
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,500
Quiet. Do not yell.

1453
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:54,400
Mrs Otterbourne,
can not be here.

1454
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:56,000
My patient rests.

1455
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,800
It is vitally important.

1456
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,200
It s all. Everything, Cramer!

1457
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:02,800
Look, do not tolerate the elbow.

1458
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,600
Mr. Doyle, I say that
I, Salom Otterbourne,

1459
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,000
I have succeeded where
others have failed.

1460
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:12,200
I'm even better than the great
detective Hercule Poirot.

1461
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:15,000
Mrs Otterbourne, by God, clmese.

1462
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:19,100
Now cuntenos the story
from the beginning.

1463
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:23,100
"I refuse to speak to
l." Then do not talk.

1464
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,900
Outside, now.

1465
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,100
"The fever rises with
excitement." Doctor,

1466
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:30,100
e are up more if
you have to say.

1467
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:33,800
-Sr. Doyle. "It's about my wife!

S, est bien.

01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:39,300
You can stay for three minutes.

1470
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,800
Three minutes.

1471
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:43,700
And you lower your voice, okay?

1472
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,800
Qu woman!

1473
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,600
Antiptico man.

I understand that has evidence mat quin Mrs.
Doyle?

You have understood and I have.

1476
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,300
I guess I agree

1477
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,600
that whoever mat Louise Bourget

1478
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:05,200
Also mat to Linnet Doyle.

1479
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:06,900
It is quite possible.

1480
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,700
Well ...

1481
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:11,800
I saw Louise Bourget quin mat

1482

Please contine, Madam.

1484
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:26,400
I was in the stern of the boat
talking to a crew member

1485
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:29,400
I showed some fascinating

1486
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:33,900
a Buffalo and a camel together
in a team, plowing the ground.

1487
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,300
All I saw the light of the
moon, of course, Madam?

1488
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,300
S, as it was.

1489
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:42,600
I have a beautiful view.

1490
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,200
Well, I walked away ...

1491
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,800
And suddenly, when he went
down the corridor,

1492
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,600
or cry.

1493
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:53,400
Sali's cabin Louise Bourget.

1494
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,500
Then I saw you open
the cabin door.

1495
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,600
When the door opened ms

1496
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,500
I saw it ..

1497
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:19,900
The Pennington.

1498
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:36,500
Or a loud bang.

1499
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:37,800
Qu pas now?

1500
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:40,000
Mrs Otterbourne shot.

1501
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,800
-Sr. Pennington.-S?

1502
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:49,600
Is your gun, I think.

1503
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,300
Anyone could get it
out of the cabin.

1504
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:53,900
Saban was ah.

1505
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:56,700
Recently I have been told
revlver when I travel.

1506
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,600
The killings must stop.

1507
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,300
Unfortunately, I have
delayed a lot.

1508
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:06,200
I would like to see everyone
in the living room,

1509
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,400
where everything to be revealed

1510
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:10,400
in a few ...

1511
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,100
thirty minutes.

1512
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:21,400
I can not believe it.

1513
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:23,600
My mother died.

1514
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,700
Why?

1515
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,100
Debi discovered something.

1516
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:30,900
By God! Poor thing!

1517
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,900
He loved her, despite
everything.

1518
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,000
And now it was.

1519
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,200
I can not assimilate.

1520
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:42,600
Suddenly qued ...

1521
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:45,300
Sola.

1522
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,000
No, it's ace.

1523
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,800
I'll take care of.

1524
01:51:53,900 --> 01:51:55,100
Jim ...

1525
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:58,200
Poor mother.

1526
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:01,100
It will not have escaped

1527
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:03,900
while alive.

1528
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:28,800
Madam, seoritas, ladies ...

1529
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:31,300
the game ends.

1530
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:33,200
I, Hercule Poirot,

1531
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,500
s now, without a shadow of doubt, quin mat to Ms.
Doyle,

1532
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:39,600
Louise Bourget and Mrs.
Otterbourne.

1533
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,900
Awkwardly, start the research
with the preconceived idea

1534
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:47,000
Bean attended that
scene agresin,

1535
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:50,100
between Miss Jackie
and Simon Doyle.

1536
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:54,400
Bean that person got the gun

1537
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:57,900
AFTER that all left
the salon Haban

1538
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,800
and the bean used to kill Ms.
Doyle

1539
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:04,800
and try to incriminate Ms.
Jackie.

1540
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:10,200
As podrn see, no lack of
suspects among you.

1541
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:15,300
May be someone who tried
to smear his mouth shut.

1542
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:19,400
Or that he attributed his ruin to the father of Ms.
Doyle.

1543
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:23,000
Or someone obsessed with
the idea of a robbery.

1544
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:27,700
Or someone angry with the
heirs of fortunes.

1545
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:31,600
Or someone with a firm Decision
to save his mother

1546
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,400
from financial ruin.

1547
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,000
Or even

1548
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:40,700
someone eager to avoid the penalty
as curator fraudulent.

1549
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:46,700
Or someone who mistook the
identity of the victim.

1550
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,100
And then ...

1551
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:57,100
record is very important.

1552
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,700
That night we slept soundly,

1553
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,100
not lightly, as is my custom.

1554
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,100
Why?

1555
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:06,700
Because my wine is drugged bean

1556
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,700
someone who does not
want to be present

1557
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
in the events of the night.

1558
01:54:12,700 --> 01:54:13,900
Quite easy.

1559
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,800
Opened bottles left
on the tables.

1560
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:18,700
T, Colonel,

1561
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,200
return the bottle saying,
using your own words,

1562
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,200
he was''rusty.''

1563
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,600
This, s,

1564
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:29,000
implies premeditacin by someone.

1565
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,800
It means that yesterday

1566
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,700
before 7:30, the crime had
already been decided.

1567
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,300
Haba something that confused
me from the beginning.

1568
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:45,000
If the intention was to
blame for Miss Jackie,

1569
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:49,000
Why was not the gun in the bedroom of Mrs.
Doyle?

1570
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:50,800
And then entend.

1571
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,700
The murderer bean removed the weapon because l.
..

1572
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,900
or she had to withdraw.
haba No other reason.

1573
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,100
And some more beans.

1574
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:03,000
Dr. Bessner,

1575
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,500
you examined the body of Ms.
Doyle.

1576
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:08,900
S.

1577
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:13,500
Remember the scorched
around the wound.

1578
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:17,300
The revlver was very close
to his head when shot.

1579
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,400
That's right.

1580
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:23,800
But when we recovered the
weapon of the Nile

1581
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:27,300
This scarf was wrapped
in brocade.

1582
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:30,600
Obviously, tan shot atravesndola

1583
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:33,600
presumably to muffle the
noise of the shot.

1584
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:35,600
Doctor Bessner,

1585
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,400
if it had been fired from
among the stole,

1586
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,300
there were charred temple of Ms.
Doyle.

1587
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,900
That is, the shot that could
not shoot the mat

1588
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:49,600
among the stole.

1589
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,700
So maybe it was the other.

1590
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,100
Jackie Bellefort who
shoots Simon Doyle.

1591
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:57,800
Jackie!

1592
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:03,200
But tenamos witness.
Sabamos as it was not.

1593
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,600
Therefore, there was
a third shot.

1594
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:13,500
In one we know nothing.

1595
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:17,200
However,

1596
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:21,400
slo revlver had two bullets.

1597
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:33,400
The following curious
circumstance

1598
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:36,600
this happened in the cabin of Mrs.
Doyle.

1599
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:40,900
Ah found two bottles
of nail nails.

1600
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:43,100
One bottle was marked "Rosa"

1601
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:45,800
but the few drops that were ah

1602
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,500
were not pink, but red.

1603
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:51,800
And instead of the usual
smell of enamel,

1604
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,200
vinegar.

1605
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,900
Friends, it was red ink

1606
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:00,800
tena inevitable that
a wired connection

1607
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:04,100
this hanky could find

1608
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,600
together with the revlver
wrapped in a stole.

1609
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,100
The ink out of fabric fcilmente

1610
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,600
leaving a pink stain PLIDA.

1611
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:16,000
Then something happened

1612
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:18,800
need to rinse off,
leaving no doubt.

1613
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,100
Louise Bourget was killed

1614
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,200
because blackmailing
the murderer.

1615
01:57:25,900 --> 01:57:30,200
We know this does not only by the
fragment of thousand-franc

1616
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:34,400
we find between your
fingers dead

1617
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,400
but Also curious for words said

1618
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:41,000
this morning.

1619
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,100
Naturally,

1620
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:45,000
if you could not sleep ...

1621
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:48,400
Of course, if you
could not sleep,

1622
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,800
if it had been on the cover,

1623
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:53,100
Perhaps it would have
been the murderer

1624
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:56,400
entering or exiting the
cabin of the Lord.

1625
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:01,100
Qu, exactly, that we deca?

1626
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,500
Qu, exactly, she told us ...

1627
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,200
with that?

1628
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:13,500
S he stayed on deck

1629
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,000
was the murderer.

1630
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:18,400
S. But still you do not understand
qu I mean, Colonel.

1631
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,500
Why do we say that to us?

1632
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:23,500
As a key?

1633
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:27,000
As a key, of course,
but for us qu?

1634
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:30,500
Quin know the murderer.

1635
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:34,100
You can do one of two things:
decrnoslo or shut up

1636
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:37,500
to demand money to the
person involved.

1637
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:39,700
But it does neither.

1638
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:42,200
Use the conditional
tense, please.

1639
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:44,300
Had I been ...''''

1640
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,700
Slo may mean that was a key

1641
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:50,200
but it was a key
to the murderer.

1642
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:53,700
In other words, was present
at the time.

1643
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,500
But, on top of you and m,

1644
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:01,800
slo else was present.

1645
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:05,000
Precisely. Simon Doyle.

1646
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:08,200
Qu?

1647
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:15,000
S.

1648
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:18,300
The Doctor always accompanied him.
She tena to talk.

1649
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:21,200
-Quiz tenams no option.
"Do not be so ridiculous.

1650
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:24,900
I do not think that is ridiculous.
I remember his response.

1651
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,300
Protect you''.''

1652
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:30,300
''No one accuses you
of anything.''

1653
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:34,300
Exactly the security that it we want y.
..

1654
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:35,700
he obtained.

1655
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,400
Lord P. ..

1656
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:44,700
This time he made the
ridiculous, no doubt.

1657
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,500
I have witnesses to prove that
I could not kill Linnet.

1658
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,800
S that has

1659
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:53,000
but it s the mat

1660
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:55,200
and saw Louise Bourget.

1661
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:58,800
Qu nonsense! I say, Mr. Doyle

1662
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,600
pruning does not move
with a broken leg.

1663
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:06,100
He testified before any
court in the world.

1664
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:10,100
And I have to say that his testimony is ...
irrelevant.

1665
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:12,500
lrrelevante?

1666
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,600
l-Pierre-le-te-van.

1667
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:17,300
lrrelevante?

1668
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:19,700
I?

1669
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:22,900
I have witnessed

1670
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:26,300
sicolgicos where more complex
of the century.

1671
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,200
My testimony alone had
saved Strutzrumple ...

1672
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:33,900
The murderer of Dresden,
the execution.

1673
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:35,500
Quiet.

1674
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:37,500
Slo say it is irrelevant

1675
02:00:37,700 --> 02:00:39,700
because he began to meet Mr.
Doyle

1676
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,400
five minutes AFTER he was shot.

1677
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,700
He could not move during
those five minutes.

1678
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:49,200
True, if you already triggered Haban.
But it was ace?

1679
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:54,900
Note the bean is actually seen.

1680
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:57,700
Ms. Jacqueline Rosalie saw fire.

1681
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,900
Doyle saw fall to the floor.

1682
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,700
Yluego went out to seek help,
met with Ferguson,

1683
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:06,600
that habaodo shooting.

1684
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:12,200
Doyle saw lslo pressing
a red hanky in his leg.

1685
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:15,300
Doyle figured that
he shot Haban,

1686
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:18,200
but the presumption was wrong.

1687
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:21,700
The bullet is not enough to Doyle.
Was elsewhere.

1688
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,500
Qu Yahor happens?

1689
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,900
Jackie Doyle insists that
the bear to his cabin

1690
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:30,000
and not be left alone.

1691
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:36,100
Ms. Murray and Mr. Ferguson's
accompanied to the cabin.

1692
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:37,300
AFTER,

1693
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:40,600
Ms. Rosalie seeks
to Miss Bowers.

1694
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:46,400
Andall the attention focuses
on the starboard side.

1695
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:47,500
Ms. Bowers!

1696
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:01,500
Doyle slo needs two minutes.

1697
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:04,100
He takes off his shoes.

1698
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,500
Collect revlver from
under the sofa,

1699
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:10,500
Jackie bot where
to find him not,

1700
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:13,500
runs like a hare
by the port roof

1701
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:17,400
and enters the cabin
of his wife.

1702
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:04,200
Then take the shawl of Mrs.
Van Schuyler

1703
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:07,800
that hidden bean, wrap the gun

1704
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:11,400
to dampen noise and
prevent scorching,

1705
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:14,600
fires a bullet into his own leg.

1706
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:28,200
Remove one of the
cartridges used,

1707
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:29,900
to dispose of,

1708
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:33,000
and introduces a new

1709
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,500
indicating whether
the revlver is,

1710
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:38,600
slo that two bullets were fired.

1711
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,100
Wrap again stole the gun,

1712
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:58,100
Add the stained hanky

1713
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:02,100
and an ashtray mrmol for
everything collapses,

1714
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:05,600
and throws the package out
the window, the Nile

1715
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,400
You lie on the sofa

1716
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:12,700
pressing the wound with
another hanky,

1717
02:04:13,600 --> 02:04:16,400
this time in real agony.

1718
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:27,700
Extraordinary, is not as?

1719
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:29,800
Impossible.

1720
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:31,200
I can hardly believe it.

1721
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:33,800
S. Of course, absolutely
impossible.

1722
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:35,400
Why do you ask?

1723
02:04:35,700 --> 02:04:38,100
T odo said yourself
beans gentle steps.

1724
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,800
Why someone will run?

1725
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,600
The s, but do all
of that impulse?

1726
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:46,900
Once and for all, Sir,
was not impulsive,

1727
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:48,900
was carefully planned.

1728
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,000
By Doyle?

1729
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:52,900
Slo Doyle plays a role.

1730
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:55,300
For his accomplices,

1731
02:04:55,600 --> 02:04:58,100
Ms. Jacqueline de Bellefort.

1732
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:04,100
You must be crazy.

1733
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,000
No, I'm not crazy.

1734
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:09,400
It's true.

1735
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:12,200
Quin Doyle gave an alibi?

1736
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:14,700
You, by firing a shot.

1737
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:17,700
And quin gave you his alibi?

1738
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:19,700
Doyle,

1739
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:23,300
insisting that accompanied
all night.

1740
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,800
Not true! It is not!

1741
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:29,700
S is true. To deny qu?

1742
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:33,500
You and Doyle were lovers.

1743
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:35,800
It still are lovers.

1744
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:38,100
The plan was that Simon
killed his wife,

1745
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:41,800
inherit the money, and
then at a later date

1746
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:44,700
to marry his old flame.

1747
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,700
A brilliant concept.

1748
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:50,100
His persecution of Ms. Doyle,

1749
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:52,600
simulated wrath of Simon,

1750
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:55,800
the choice of Miss Rosalie
as a witness,

1751
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:58,700
the whole development
up to the crime,

1752
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,900
the exaggerated hysteria ...

1753
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,300
Actually, they are merely
taking a risk:

1754
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:08,400
tena Simon wound to disable it.

1755
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:12,700
And disclpeme, but for m
s there was a nonsense.

1756
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:16,100
The writing was nonsense

1757
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:18,300
the''J''in the wall
of the cabin.

1758
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:20,600
Something to melodramtico
that tena

1759
02:06:20,900 --> 02:06:22,500
to exonerate you.

1760
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:26,200
And quin will want to
do that except ...

1761
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:28,100
one accomplices?

1762
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:30,500
But then ...

1763
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:34,100
The plan began to unravel,

1764
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:35,700
as it is?

1765
02:06:36,300 --> 02:06:38,500
Louise Bourget est unveiled.

1766
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:41,600
Doyle sees run to the
cabin of his wife.

1767
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,300
Hey shot

1768
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:47,000
and sees him return
to the salon.

1769
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:52,100
It offers the silence
in exchange for money

1770
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:55,600
and in doing so, he signed
his own death.

1771
02:06:56,800 --> 02:07:00,700
Mr. Doyle could not kill, because
it could not move.

1772
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:04,500
I swear. And to be right.

1773
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:06,600
Miss Jackie the mat.

1774
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:11,000
No!

1775
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,300
S. I fear that there
is no doubt.

1776
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:18,000
Just before dinner, I asked to see Mr.
Doyle.

1777
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:22,400
Foolishly, s now accepts and
brings them together.

1778
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:25,800
The one apparently remorseful
and upset,

1779
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:27,900
and the other encouraging.

1780
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:30,500
Simon, I'm so sorry.

1781
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:31,700
Easy.

1782
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,100
I am sure that when we

1783
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:37,200
the tone changes.

1784
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:39,700
All is well, Vicar.
It almost succeeded.

1785
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:42,700
Think so. Louise knows.

1786
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,600
I saw. Try and blackmail.

1787
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:49,300
You'll have to stop it.

1788
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:54,300
"We can not pay?" All my life?

1789
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,100
Jackie, ESTs safe?

1790
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:09,000
Give me money.

1791
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,400
"To qu?" I hope so.
The distracting.

1792
02:08:13,700 --> 02:08:16,200
"On est Where to?" In my jacket.
In the closet.

1793
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:35,700
"I love you." I s.

1794
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:37,900
Are we crazy?

1795
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:40,100
No s, but we can not stop.

1796
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:43,500
Jackie ...

1797
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:46,900
Desam luck.

1798
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:02,100
Unfortunately, in their haste

1799
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:06,100
Forgot leaves a fragment
of a thousand-franc note

1800
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:08,300
between the fingers
of the dead woman.

1801
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,500
But it is an unfortunate ms:

1802
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:13,600
Mrs Otterbourne seen
leaving the cabin.

1803
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:16,400
She does not realize

1804
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:18,700
and returns to the cabin of Dr.
Bessner

1805
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,700
to return the scalpel.

1806
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:26,400
Then, ready for dinner, somewhat
flustered and agitated,

1807
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:29,400
quickly reaches the dining room.

1808
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:32,100
As for Mrs. Otterbourne,

1809
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:36,800
when Dr.
Bessner him of the
murder of Louise,

1810
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:40,200
realizes that the killer was

1811
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:43,000
alejndose the crime scene.

1812
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:44,100
Qu?

1813
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:46,400
He says he knows quin
mat to Louise?

1814
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:48,100
Quiet. Do not yell.

1815
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:51,000
Mrs Otterbourne, can not be here.
What prohbo.

1816
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:53,000
It seemed strange

1817
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:56,700
that Mr.
Doyle was shouting at
Mrs Otterbourne.

1818
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,200
S now that what was to
warn Jackie Háqqah

1819
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:01,900
in the cabin next door.

1820
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,500
Mrs Otterbourne, by God, clmese.

1821
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:08,500
Now cuntenos the story
from the beginning.

1822
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:12,600
Qu Ypor from the beginning
and the whole story?

1823
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:16,100
To give time for Jackie to act

1824
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,300
which he did immediately.

1825
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:20,400
Mr. Doyle.!

1826
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:22,600
It is the murderer of my wife.!

1827
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,300
Mr. Pennington?

1828
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,700
Boasted that his father
taught to fire bean.

1829
02:10:46,900 --> 02:10:49,100
And its not in vain boast.

1830
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:50,600
I saw that was ...

1831
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:56,700
Solt the revlver and ran
to his cabin next door.

1832
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:58,800
It was very risky,

1833
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,300
but it was her only option.

1834
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:08,900
My friends ...

1835
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,800
that's all.

1836
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:19,600
Congratulations, Mr. P.,

1837
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:23,700
-For a fun Teor.
"It's more than a theor.

1838
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,000
Unfortunately,

1839
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:28,300
is the truth.

1840
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:32,500
Y qu pas with the first bullet?

1841
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,200
The Jackie dispar me?

1842
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,500
Good question, s.

1843
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,500
They see all this table?

1844
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:41,700
It has a bullet piercing
recently here.

1845
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,600
You had time to take the bullet

1846
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,700
and throw into the Nile

1847
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:50,200
-Qu nonsense! "It is nonsense.

1848
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:52,700
We have evidence that
the three bullets

1849
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
are the weapon of
Miss Jacqueline.

1850
02:11:55,500 --> 02:11:57,100
Suppose that.

1851
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:59,800
How to prove that Simon
mixed the other two?

1852
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:01,900
Right.

1853
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:03,500
No evidence.

1854
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:06,100
Absolutely no proof.

1855
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:09,100
The find, easy. No escape.

1856
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:10,600
No?

1857
02:12:10,900 --> 02:12:13,600
Not convince a jury
without evidence.

1858
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:17,200
And Where to go to get them out, Mr.
P.?

1859
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:18,600
In Linnet?

1860
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:22,200
No. Not Linnet.

1861
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:25,100
You.

1862
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:28,300
Qu mean?

1863
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:30,000
Brag, Simon.

1864
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:32,300
Far from boasting,

1865
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:34,200
is a simple test

1866
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:37,600
now accepted as evidence in
any court in the world.

1867
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,100
It is called the
test''Moulage.''

1868
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:43,000
The''test''Moulage?

1869
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:45,600
S,''''Moulage.
When shooting a gun

1870
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:51,100
remain in the skin plvora grains
that can be removed

1871
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,300
with a thin layer of wax.

1872
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,900
sa is the''test''Moulage.

1873
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:01,600
Colonel, you do it?

1874
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:03,900
When you say.

1875
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Guess who is willing to
submit to the test?

1876
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:12,900
It does not hurt, we only
feel something ...

1877
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,700
heat.

1878
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:27,700
Jackie, qu ...?

1879
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,300
What can we do?

1880
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:40,600
Nothing.

1881
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:42,700
All over.

1882
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:54,100
Do not worry so much, Mr.

1883
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:56,500
For m, I mean.

1884
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,700
S cares, right? A little?

1885
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:01,400
S.

1886
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,200
Simon And do not judge too hard.

1887
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:06,900
He never had money and Linnet

1888
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:09,600
dazzled him with their wealth.

1889
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:13,900
Simon, remember what you said?

1890
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:15,800
I said if it were a story,

1891
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:19,200
Linnet marry me, she moriray
I inherited everything.

1892
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:22,900
It was when I knew I
conceived the idea.

1893
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:25,500
I was terrified.
Saba to try something

1894
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:27,000
perfectly absurd.

1895
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:29,500
He even had the idea of putting
the cobra in his bed.

1896
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:34,400
And you will find another use
for the snake, seorita.

1897
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,100
I'm glad I had not killed, Ser.

1898
02:14:40,300 --> 02:14:41,800
Honestly.

1899
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:46,100
So ...

1900
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:49,100
like watching ...

1901
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:52,000
tena to help him.

1902
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,900
I've always had to help.

1903
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:59,300
Jackie, I love you.

1904
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:01,700
I love you, you.

1905
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:10,800
Detnganse!

1906
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:16,500
Poirot Lord.

1907
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:31,900
Qu tragedy!

1908
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,400
A esplndido work, Poirot,
I must say.

1909
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:54,300
Could not have done the
test''Montage.''

1910
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:56,300
I have no wax.

1911
02:15:56,600 --> 02:16:00,300
Amaze me, Colonel.
"Totally amaze me.

1912
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:05,200
Adis, Mr Poirot.

1913
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:09,100
I fear that the description
of their cases have to wait

1914
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:10,800
until another time.

1915
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:12,500
Lstima Qu, Madam!

1916
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:16,000
He longed to tell you
my recent experience

1917
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:18,200
on the Orient Express.

1918
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,800
Come, Bowers. It's time to go.

1919
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,800
This place starts to
look like a morgue.

1920
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:29,100
Thank God, be in one soon.

1921
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:31,700
"Old fossils." Qu
genius, Bowers!

1922
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:34,400
Need a refreshing holiday.

1923
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:38,900
I thought a trip to
the Gobi Desert.

1924
02:16:42,700 --> 02:16:45,200
Mr. Poirot, I want to
be the first to know.

1925
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:47,300
We have just engaged.

1926
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:49,300
Congratulations, seorita.

1927
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:51,300
Lord ...

1928
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:53,800
"Congratulations.
And good luck. "Thanks.

1929
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:55,900
-Adis, Mr. Poirot. "Adis, Ser.

1930
02:16:56,100 --> 02:16:57,900
Colonel Race. "Good luck.

1931
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:01,900
My little ones!

1932
02:17:02,900 --> 02:17:04,300
A tip ...

1933
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:06,500
As they say in America:

1934
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:08,600
Calmly''.''

1935
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:10,700
We'll try.

1936
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:20,600
In qu think?

1937
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:23,100
I thought Moliro.

1938
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:30,200
Eyelet were talking
sb known language.

1939
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,400
Ambicin''The great women

1940
