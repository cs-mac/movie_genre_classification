{2461}{2576}1937
{5088}{5154}Gentlemen, I wanna welcome|you medical schoolmen...
{5159}{5206}...to our new operating theatre.
{5210}{5281}As you can see,|it isn't exactly what you'd call new.
{5285}{5345}Used to be a library|when this was a school...
{5349}{5426}...and maybe before that|some kind of a sugar warehouse.
{5430}{5504}Makeshift or not, the important|thing is that we got it.
{5509}{5581}The first to be devoted|to psychosurgery in this state.
{5585}{5637}And that is a great step forward.
{5642}{5698}Now you're going|to witness an operation...
{5703}{5775}...never performed before|in this state.
{5779}{5822}A lobotomy on a woman's brain...
{5826}{5898}...suffering from acute|schizophrenic withdrawal.
{5903}{5978}Our new staff member,|Dr. John Cukrowicz from Chicago...
{5982}{6036}...will perform this operation.
{7015}{7040}Swab.
{8573}{8608}Sew up, will you?
{8701}{8790}You have just witnessed a delicate|operation on the human brain...
{8794}{8879}...performed under the most|primitive surgical conditions...
{8884}{8961}...that I hope any of you|will ever encounter.
{9170}{9210}Excuse us, please.
{9374}{9434}- Son, I know how you feel.|- For six months...
{9438}{9505}...I have listened to you|promise me this and that.
{9509}{9565}- But I am not...|- I know, I know, I know.
{9569}{9651}You are not the state board of health.|I am not a witch doctor.
{9655}{9714}I need properly trained assistants.
{9718}{9790}I need an operating room|that doesn't fall apart.
{9795}{9837}At least lights that stay lit.
{9842}{9903}I know, but this is a state hospital.
{9907}{9955}There just isn't|enough money for us.
{9959}{10020}I can't promise|that there ever will be enough.
{10062}{10130}I'll go back to Chicago|or someplace where there is.
{10134}{10159}John.
{10186}{10260}Before you do that,|read this.
{10462}{10502}Who is Violet Venable?
{10506}{10564}You reveal your ignorance|of our fair city...
{10568}{10629}...of which Mrs. Venable|is the richest lady.
{10633}{10738}At one time, her husband owned most of|it. Now she's a widow and she owns it.
{10743}{10831}"...and was very interested|in the work of your Dr. Cukrowicz."
{10835}{10905}She must have read your|write-up in the "Herald".
{10910}{11001}"And I wonder if the foundation|I am establishing...
{11006}{11062}...might be of some assistance."
{11085}{11138}Son, with one signature|on one check...
{11142}{11206}...she can solve|all the problems we got.
{11218}{11284}"Also there is a matter|of some urgency...
{11289}{11347}...I should like to discuss with him.
{11359}{11431}Would 4:30 on Tuesday be convenient?"
{11439}{11472}That's today.
{11486}{11530}What is her urgency, do you know?
{11534}{11614}No, but I know what ours is.|Lack of money. Her money.
{11619}{11654}She is serious?
{11659}{11706}4:30 this afternoon, you'll know.
{11711}{11747}I can tell you this much.
{11752}{11834}I've been trying for years|just to see the Venable lawyers.
{11839}{11919}You've been invited by her.|That's a command performance.
{11924}{11978}That's how serious I think it is.
{11985}{12032}And this is serious too.
{12037}{12150}More than 1200 mental cases|Lions View can't afford to handle.
{12465}{12490}Good afternoon.
{12494}{12551}- Dr. Cukrowicz.|- Yes, sir.
{12619}{12690}- Take a seat, please.|- Thank you.
{13042}{13069}Mrs. Venable?
{13074}{13146}I am Miss Foxhill,|Mrs. Venable's secretary.
{13150}{13200}And you are Dr. Cukrowicz?
{13205}{13275}- Your appointment was for...?|- 4:30.
{13280}{13368}You are 23 seconds early.|Sit down, please.
{13382}{13412}Thank you.
{13496}{13564}Sebastian always said,|"Mother, when you descend...
{13569}{13623}...it's like the goddess|from the machine."
{13631}{13739}- Mrs. Venable's on her way down.|- I feel just like an angel...
{13744}{13813}...coming to earth|as I float, float into view.
{13828}{13853}Sebastian...
{13869}{13948}...my son, Sebastian, was|very interested in the Byzantine.
{13952}{14009}Are you interested|in the Byzantine, Dr...?
{14018}{14044}Cukrowicz.
{14048}{14104}I don't know very much|about the Byzantine.
{14110}{14203}The emperor of Byzantium,|when he received people in audience...
{14207}{14271}...had a throne which,|during the conversation...
{14275}{14383}...would rise mysteriously in the air|to the consternation of the visitors.
{14387}{14462}As we are living in a democracy,|I reverse the procedure.
{14466}{14507}I don't rise. I come down.
{14512}{14578}How do you do, Dr...?|Oh, I'm sorry, your name?
{14582}{14609}Cukrowicz.
{14615}{14682}It's a Polish word meaning "sugar."
{14708}{14800}Am I only wearing one earring?|Have I forgotten my lip rouge?
{14809}{14849}Excuse me, I...
{14854}{14929}I guess I had been told|you were a widow.
{14936}{14988}I am. I'm in mourning.
{14993}{15052}White was my son's favourite colour.
{15057}{15116}Perhaps, Dr. Sugar...
{15121}{15175}...you expected an old widow.
{15179}{15242}With a garnet brooch, a cane|and an ear trumpet.
{15246}{15294}I have all that|to look forward to.
{15299}{15407}Life is a thief. Sebastian always|said, "Life steals everything."
{15412}{15460}I want to show you his garden.
{15464}{15522}Are you sure you should go out,|Mrs. Venable?
{15526}{15580}Quite sure.|They treat me like an invalid.
{15584}{15712}You see, last spring I had a tiny|convulsion of a tiny blood vessel.
{15716}{15754}What did your doctor call it?
{15758}{15790}A malady of living.
{15794}{15900}After all, I've buried a husband|and a son. I'm a widow and a...
{15910}{15957}Funny, there's no word.
{15962}{16015}Lose your parents, you're an orphan.
{16020}{16098}Lose your only son and you are...
{16135}{16162}...nothing.
{16202}{16228}Foxhill.
{16262}{16301}Where are they?
{16318}{16361}I put them in the patio.
{16366}{16462}They sent them parcel post from|Pensacola. That's why they were late.
{16466}{16554}Another day and we'd have starved|to death. Come on, doctor.
{16578}{16652}In your letter,|you said an urgent matter.
{16656}{16741}I must say, you're handsomer|than your photograph in the paper...
{16745}{16818}...without that awful paraphernalia|you doctors wear.
{16823}{16888}Your son's favourite colour, white.
{16893}{16950}Such extraordinary eyes.
{16955}{17023}So like his. You must...
{17028}{17140}I almost said, "You must meet|my son Sebastian." Force of habit.
{17145}{17179}Is he the son who died?
{17184}{17222}Yes, last July, in Europe.
{17227}{17267}He must have been young to die.
{17271}{17299}All poets...
{17304}{17391}...whatever age they may seem|to others, die young.
{18170}{18254}- It's unexpected.|- Like the dawn of creation.
{18259}{18304}It was Sebastian's idea.
{18309}{18396}Part of his lifelong war|against the herbaceous border.
{18401}{18494}Not unlike a well-groomed jungle|and, frankly, a little terrifying.
{18499}{18542}So was creation.
{18546}{18626}So is creation.|Listen to them buzz, buzz.
{18630}{18666}What's in there?
{18670}{18735}This way, before our poor lady|dies of hunger.
{18740}{18810}The Latin names to the plants|are printed on tags...
{18814}{18866}...attached to them,|but the print's fading.
{18870}{18940}Those ones there|are the oldest plants on earth.
{18945}{19030}Survivors from the age|of the giant fern forest.
{19035}{19077}And here's my poor lady.
{19100}{19137}They never get away.
{19142}{19262}The lady exudes this marvellous|perfume which attracts them.
{19267}{19358}They plunge into her chalice.|And they never come out.
{19370}{19429}This operation|you perform is called...?
{19457}{19485}Lobotomy.
{19489}{19540}- That's an unusual...|- I hate these flies.
{19544}{19574}Foxhill!
{19579}{19607}Foxhill!
{19620}{19705}She loves feeding our wicked lady.|Foxhill's rather a brute.
{19709}{19787}Such an extravagance, really,|from early fall to late spring...
{19791}{19836}...lady must be kept under glass...
{19841}{19926}...and we have to provide her|with flies flown in at great expense.
{19930}{19982}Foxhill, you do the honours.
{19987}{20074}- Lady's very hungry today.|- Of course, Mrs. Venable.
{20078}{20172}I've never seen an insectivorous|plant before. What is it called?
{20177}{20228}The Venus flytrap.
{20235}{20283}A devouring organism...
{20288}{20366}...aptly named|for the goddess of love.
{20389}{20474}What was your son's work?|I mean, aside from this garden.
{20478}{20554}As many times as I've had|to answer that question...
{20558}{20608}...it still shocks me|a little to realize...
{20612}{20684}...that Sebastian Venable the poet|was quite unknown...
{20688}{20766}...outside of a small coterie|of friends, including his mother.
{20770}{20850}- Your son was a poet?|- His life was his occupation.
{20855}{20918}Yes. Yes, Sebastian was a poet.
{20922}{20995}That's what I meant|when I said his life was his work.
{21005}{21113}Because the work of a poet|is the life of a poet. And vice versa.
{21118}{21173}I mean, you can't separate them.|I mean...
{21178}{21251}...a poet's life is his work.
{21256}{21360}And his work is his life,|in a special sense.
{21467}{21544}- Are you all right?|- Right as rain, however right that is.
{21559}{21625}This operation of yours,|does it really work?
{21636}{21679}Yes, yes, it does.
{21684}{21733}However, it is very experimental.
{21738}{21836}I was struck by something|you said in the paper.
{21841}{21908}About the sharp knife in the mind.
{21912}{21956}That kills the devil in the soul?
{21981}{22032}I'm afraid I got a bit carried away.
{22054}{22158}No, what you said|was almost poetic itself.
{22190}{22291}Mrs. Venable, the work|of a doctor is his life too.
{22296}{22407}But we need help, particularly|in a field as experimental as mine.
{22412}{22500}Particularly at a state hospital|like Lions View.
{22518}{22576}We have very little money,|practically none.
{22580}{22618}Yes, I know.
{22629}{22654}Doctor...
{22665}{22709}...I have a niece by marriage...
{22714}{22761}...at a place called St. Mary's.
{22766}{22798}I've heard of it.
{22806}{22857}It's a custodial home for the insane.
{22862}{22948}She suffers from something|called dementia praecox.
{22953}{22981}From dementia praecox?
{22986}{23056}Which is to say, she's mad|as a hatter, poor child.
{23060}{23112}Would you like to|see Sebastian's studio?
{23116}{23202}It's at the end of the jungle|in what used to be the "garçonnière.
{23206}{23246}An old New Orleans convenience.
{23251}{23325}A place where the young men|could go to be private.
{23330}{23372}You're not from New Orleans?
{23377}{23483}No, Chicago. Actually, dementia|praecox is a meaningless phrase...
{23488}{23582}Chicago. I've always wanted|to see two places before I die.
{23586}{23616}Hong Kong...
{23621}{23662}...and Chicago.
{23674}{23724}Now I shall never see either.
{23730}{23826}Because I must use every inch and|ounce of what little strength I have...
{23830}{23890}...in doing just what I'm doing.
{23895}{23935}The foundation you referred to?
{23940}{24005}Building a memorial to my son.
{24010}{24116}You see, Sebastian had|no public name as a poet.
{24121}{24169}He didn't want one.
{24174}{24225}He refused to have one.
{24230}{24327}He abhorred the false values|that come from being publicly known...
{24332}{24422}...from fame,|from personal exploitation.
{24426}{24517}He'd say to me, "Violet, Mother,|you're going to live longer than me.
{24522}{24606}When I'm gone, it will be yours|to do whatever you please with."
{24614}{24685}Meaning, of course,|his future recognition.
{24709}{24790}- You're very like him, doctor.|- In what way?
{24795}{24864}Because you, a doctor, a surgeon...
{24869}{24938}...are dedicated to your art.
{24946}{25022}Yes, to your art.|It is an art, what you do.
{25027}{25078}Using people the way he did.
{25083}{25136}Grandly, creatively.
{25147}{25205}Almost like God.
{25210}{25270}I'm afraid my art is to help.
{25275}{25335}Not to use, but to be used.
{25381}{25452}Well, it comes to the same,|doesn't it?
{25457}{25511}I mean, in the end.
{25534}{25582}Oh, I don't know what I mean.
{25602}{25688}There is the atelier,|Sebastian's studio.
{25702}{25749}Most people's lives...
{25757}{25823}...what are they|but trails of debris?
{25828}{25883}Each day more debris, more debris.
{25888}{25971}Long, long trails of debris...
{25980}{26064}...with nothing to clean it all up|but, finally, death.
{26088}{26119}I guess...
{26131}{26225}...quiet desperation|is the word for most lives.
{26256}{26304}But ours were different.
{26309}{26362}Sebastian's and mine.
{26377}{26460}I know it sounds|hopelessly vain to say...
{26465}{26519}...but we were a famous couple.
{26524}{26595}People didn't speak of Sebastian|and his mother...
{26600}{26662}...or Mrs. Venable and her son.
{26666}{26713}They said, "Sebastian and Violet.
{26718}{26802}Violet and Sebastian are at the Lido.|They're at the Ritz."
{26812}{26898}And every appearance,|every time we appeared...
{26903}{26962}...attention was centred on us.
{26970}{27017}Everyone else eclipsed.
{27028}{27100}My son, Sebastian...
{27110}{27150}...and I...
{27155}{27203}...constructed our days.
{27208}{27310}Each day, we would carve each day|like a piece of sculpture.
{27345}{27404}We left behind us a trail of days...
{27409}{27465}...like a gallery of sculpture...
{27493}{27582}...until suddenly, last summer...
{27603}{27636}Your son died?
{27827}{27921}You say that your niece suffers|from dementia praecox.
{27926}{27983}There must have been|a more exact diagnosis.
{28002}{28065}Such a pretty name for a disease.
{28070}{28129}Sounds like a rare flower,|doesn't it?
{28134}{28196}Night-blooming dementia praecox.
{28244}{28304}What form does her disturbance take?
{28309}{28337}Madness.
{28349}{28394}Obsession, memory.
{28398}{28462}She lacerates herself with memory.
{28466}{28502}Memory of what?
{28507}{28564}Visions, hallucinations.
{28582}{28627}It all started last summer.
{28632}{28749}The first I knew, there was a cable|from this clinic in Paris...
{28754}{28829}...saying, "Your niece is out|of her mind. What shall we do?"
{28833}{28885}I was almost out of my mind|last summer.
{28889}{28976}Sebastian had just died, I was ill,|but I did everything I could.
{28981}{29049}I said, "Send her straight home|with a nurse."
{29054}{29118}So they put her on the "Berengaria"...
{29129}{29194}...locked in her stateroom|like a wild animal.
{29198}{29253}She was taken straight to St. Mary's.
{29258}{29354}And now they can't keep her there,|they can't help her...
{29358}{29408}...or cope with her fits of violence.
{29413}{29499}Her babbling.|Her dreadful, obscene babbling.
{29504}{29600}- What kind of babbling?|- Fantastic delusions and babblings...
{29605}{29641}...of an unspeakable nature.
{29646}{29702}Mostly taking the form|of hideous attacks...
{29707}{29786}...on the moral character|of my son, Sebastian.
{29792}{29873}And now they tell me at St. Mary's...
{29878}{29924}...the Mother Superior tells me...
{29929}{29994}...that we must find|another place for her.
{30058}{30118}And then I read about you...
{30126}{30205}...about your operation,|and I thought:
{30210}{30267}"This may be the answer|to all our prayers."
{30277}{30330}You must realize|the operation I do...
{30334}{30401}...is only for the unapproachable,|for the hopeless.
{30405}{30485}If she isn't unapproachable|and hopeless, I don't know who is.
{30489}{30526}- The things she says.|- What?
{30530}{30582}- Terrible, obscene things.|- Such as?
{30586}{30630}Oh, anything.
{30634}{30665}Such as?
{30685}{30724}All right, you asked.
{30729}{30789}This happened recently at St. Mary's.
{30794}{30877}Catherine accused an elderly gardener|of making love to her.
{30882}{30938}They questioned the gardener,|an old man.
{30942}{30978}It was the other way around.
{30982}{31070}Catherine had made advances to him,|spoken obscenely to him.
{31074}{31146}When confronted with her lies,|she fought and screamed.
{31150}{31196}It took four nuns to control her.
{31200}{31293}Now I'm put on notice that they|won't keep her there after this week.
{31297}{31336}You see why I said urgent.
{31341}{31381}Yes, I do. I certainly do.
{31385}{31445}It's important I see her|as soon as possible.
{31449}{31515}And help her. If you can't,|I'm at my wits' end.
{31519}{31601}I can transfer her to Lions View.|She won't be as comfortable...
{31605}{31634}I understand.
{31639}{31691}But the important thing|is you, doctor.
{31695}{31758}You'll be happy to know|that at this very minute...
{31762}{31856}...my lawyers are working on the|Sebastian Venable Memorial Foundation...
{31861}{31948}...to subsidize the work|of young people like yourself...
{31953}{32026}...who are pushing out|the frontiers of art and science...
{32030}{32072}...but have a financial problem.
{32084}{32180}Mrs. Venable, loving your niece|as you do, you must know...
{32185}{32254}...there's great risk|in this operation.
{32258}{32366}When you enter the brain with a foreign|object, even a needle-thin knife...
{32371}{32427}...in the hands|of the most skilled surgeon...
{32449}{32518}...there still is|a great deal of risk.
{32525}{32585}But it does pacify them,|I've read that.
{32590}{32669}It quiets them down.|It makes them peaceful.
{32674}{32766}- Yes, that it does do, but...|- But what?
{32771}{32858}Well, it will be years before we know|if the benefits...
{32863}{32925}...of the operation are lasting...
{32932}{32991}...or maybe just passing|or perhaps...
{33005}{33099}There's a strong possibility that|the patient will always be limited.
{33104}{33186}Relieved of acute anxiety,|yes, but limited.
{33191}{33292}But what a blessing to them, doctor,|to be just peaceful.
{33326}{33402}To be just suddenly peaceful.
{33421}{33469}After all that horror...
{33477}{33528}...after those nightmares...
{33540}{33625}...just to be able to lift up|their eyes to a sky...
{33630}{33686}...not black with savage,|devouring birds.
{33691}{33769}You said a sky filled|with savage, devouring birds?
{33774}{33799}Did I?
{33804}{33892}How odd. I hadn't thought|about all that in years.
{33897}{33943}Now, why should I suddenly...?
{33948}{34050}Yes, we saw those birds|one summer in the Pacific.
{34055}{34150}You see, my son|Sebastian was looking for...
{34155}{34249}- Looking for what?|- Rare, hungry birds.
{34256}{34349}- That's not what you started to say.|- You're too quick for me.
{34354}{34458}I was going to say my son|Sebastian was looking for God.
{34463}{34535}I stopped myself.|I thought you'd think:
{34540}{34646}"What a pretentious young crackpot."|Which Sebastian was not.
{34657}{34735}This is something|I've never told anyone before.
{34740}{34781}Something so terrible.
{34786}{34890}Forgive me if I sound quite mad,|but it's true all the same.
{34895}{34969}Sebastian saw the face of God.
{34977}{35026}I'd like to hear about that.
{35035}{35097}Yes, yes.
{35122}{35230}One long ago summer,|sitting right here in this garden...
{35235}{35302}...Sebastian said,|"Mother, listen to this."
{35308}{35388}And he read me|Herman Melville's description...
{35392}{35483}...of the Encantadas,|the Galapagos Islands.
{35488}{35583}He read me that description|and said we had to go there.
{35588}{35640}So we did go there that summer...
{35645}{35704}...on a boat,|a four-masted schooner...
{35709}{35798}...the sort of boat that Melville|would have sailed on.
{35803}{35856}We saw the Encantadas.
{35861}{35924}But on the Encantadas|we saw something...
{35929}{35981}...that he hadn't written about.
{35990}{36062}We saw the sea turtles|crawl out of the sea...
{36067}{36116}...for their annual egg-laying.
{36121}{36196}Once a year, the female|of the sea turtles...
{36201}{36287}...crawls out of the sea|onto the blazing sand beach...
{36292}{36389}...of a volcanic island|to dig a pit in the sand...
{36394}{36455}...and deposit her eggs there.
{36460}{36560}It's a long and dreadful thing,|the depositing of the eggs in the sand.
{36566}{36605}And when it's finished...
{36610}{36748}...the exhausted female turtle|crawls back to the sea half-dead.
{36753}{36805}She never sees her offspring.
{36825}{36854}But we did.
{36859}{36971}Sebastian knew exactly when|the sea turtle eggs would be hatched.
{36976}{37051}- We returned in time for it.|- You went back?
{37056}{37180}In time to witness the hatching|and their desperate flight to the sea.
{37185}{37297}The narrow beach, the colour|of caviar, was all in motion.
{37302}{37387}The sky was in motion,|full of flesh-eating birds.
{37392}{37437}And the noise of the birds...
{37442}{37500}...their savage cries|as they circled...
{37505}{37556}...over the beach|of the Encantadas...
{37561}{37636}...while the new sea turtles|scrambled out...
{37641}{37701}...and started their race to the sea.
{37706}{37789}- Race to the sea?|- To escape the flesh-eating birds...
{37794}{37860}...that made the sky almost black.
{37865}{37989}And I said, "Sebastian, no.|No, it's not like that."
{37997}{38094}But he made me look.|He made me see that terrible sight.
{38099}{38158}- What was not like that?|- Life.
{38166}{38204}I said, "No.
{38209}{38293}No! That's not true!"
{38298}{38336}But he said it is.
{38341}{38434}He said, "Look, Violet.|Look, there on the shore."
{38439}{38547}And I looked and saw the sand|all alive, all alive...
{38552}{38630}...as the new-hatched sea turtles|dashed to the sea...
{38635}{38717}...while the birds hovered|and swooped to attack...
{38722}{38796}...and hovered and swooped to attack.
{38817}{38892}They were diving down|on the sea turtles...
{38897}{39024}...turning them over|to expose their soft undersides...
{39029}{39102}...tearing their undersides open...
{39113}{39206}...and rending and eating their flesh.
{39262}{39342}Sebastian guessed that possibly...
{39347}{39424}...only a hundredth|of one percent of their number...
{39429}{39473}...would escape to the sea.
{39532}{39614}Nature isn't created|in the image of man's compassion.
{39619}{39659}Nature is cruel!
{39672}{39757}Sebastian knew it all along,|was born knowing it, but not I.
{39762}{39874}I said, "No, no, those are|only birds, turtles, not us."
{39879}{39931}I didn't know then it was us.
{39936}{40053}That we are all of us trapped|by this devouring creation.
{40058}{40149}I couldn't, wouldn't face|the horror of the truth...
{40154}{40216}...even that last day|in the Encantadas...
{40221}{40266}...when Sebastian left me...
{40271}{40345}...and spent the whole|blazing, equatorial day...
{40350}{40438}...in the crow's-nest,|watching that thing on the beach...
{40442}{40496}...until it was too dark to see.
{40501}{40605}When he came down the rigging,|he said, "Now I've seen him."
{40610}{40695}- And he meant God.|- Do you believe he saw God?
{40700}{40787}He saw the whole thing there|that day on the beach.
{40792}{40859}But I was like you. I said no.
{40864}{40914}I refused to believe...
{40919}{41026}...until suddenly, last summer,|I learned my son was right.
{41040}{41135}What he had shown me|in the Encantadas was the horrible...
{41140}{41200}...the inescapable truth.
{41553}{41578}Violet, honey.
{41594}{41658}- You gave me a turn.|- Hi, Aunt Vi.
{41672}{41704}Why are you two here?
{41709}{41792}We came for Sebastian's|clothes, like you said.
{41797}{41890}- Remember? Like you said.|- So we just kind of let ourselves in.
{41895}{42028}- I must have got hold of this letter.|- Caught on your sleeve probably.
{42033}{42156}That's Mrs. Holly, mother of the|St. Mary's girl, and that's her son.
{42161}{42252}Apparently, I said|he could have Sebastian's clothes.
{42257}{42364}You haven't forgotten what you said|at Elaine Tutweiler's?
{42369}{42411}Since I was going to college...
{42415}{42491}...I could have Cousin|Sebastian's clothes.
{42496}{42528}You did say that.
{42533}{42589}You said|that Son here could have...
{42601}{42684}I'm accused of generosity.|Now will you please...?
{42690}{42783}Aunt Violet is generous,|so generous to her family, Mr...
{42788}{42819}What's your name?
{42824}{42894}- Dr. Cukrowicz.|- Are you a doctor?
{42899}{42956}- Violet, you're not ill again?|- No, Grace!
{42961}{42996}I'm so relieved.
{43001}{43112}I was afraid you had another of those|strokes of yours. Those seizures.
{43117}{43248}I've never had a seizure nor a stroke.|We were discussing your daughter.
{43253}{43321}My poor lamb, my poor little girl.
{43326}{43401}- Can you help her?|- I'm gonna try to, if I can.
{43406}{43481}Mama, look here! White silk.
{43502}{43538}"Made in Rome."
{43543}{43617}Oh, boy, is this one gonna|pick up lipstick!
{43622}{43703}Take the clothes.|Don't flaunt them in my face.
{43708}{43780}Why don't you both let yourselves out?
{43785}{43899}- Get the rest another time.|- It won't take two seconds to finish.
{43904}{44016}It's impossible that Sebastian|won't walk through that door again...
{44021}{44098}...with all those bright people|he used to know.
{44103}{44147}All laughing, carrying on...
{44152}{44252}...saying those witty things|that were way over my poor head.
{44257}{44316}He was such a tease too.|You know...
{44321}{44406}...he told me that the piece of lace|on this table...
{44411}{44525}...was made by these blind nuns|in Belgium. Imagine!
{44530}{44613}- I thought I'd gone through everything.|- Who is that?
{44618}{44716}- It's the girl.|- Why, that's my poor angel, Catherine.
{44722}{44809}- I wonder why he put it there.|- Maybe he liked her.
{44826}{44916}George, take your plunder|and get out of here.
{44922}{44999}- Okay.|- This must've been taken last spring.
{45004}{45066}She's wearing her Mardi Gras gown.
{45071}{45169}Remember how lovely she was?|You loaned her your fur coat.
{45174}{45227}I remember everything.
{45248}{45323}I guess it was not exactly|a happy evening.
{45332}{45441}- What did happen?|- She was, she is a lovely girl.
{45446}{45513}And I must say, of all my relations...
{45518}{45630}...my delightful relations,|she was the one most like me.
{45642}{45688}That's why you've got to save her.
{45692}{45772}Because madness is the most horrible|doom on this earth.
{45777}{45872}Every item here has been inventoried|by the insurance people.
{45877}{45953}They'd be upset|if anything were missing.
{45959}{46072}- What do you think I am?|- On that subject, my lips are sealed.
{46081}{46133}Now, both of you, please go.
{46138}{46195}- It's almost 5:00.|- That's right.
{46200}{46266}Violet always has,|I mean, used to have...
{46271}{46341}...her 5:00 daiquiri|here with Sebastian.
{46346}{46389}Now I have it here alone.
{46399}{46460}Well, we must fly now.
{46465}{46554}I do pray you can help my poor Cathy.|Goodbye.
{46559}{46667}Violet, bye now.|Say thank you, George.
{46672}{46743}Bye, Aunt Violet.|Thanks for everything.
{46748}{46854}Aren't they awful?|Sebastian and I used to speculate...
{46859}{46910}...on how those Neanderthals...
{46915}{46994}...could've produced a girl|as rare as Catherine.
{47006}{47121}You would have liked Sebastian|and he would have been charmed by you.
{47126}{47219}He wasn't a family or a money snob,|but he was a snob.
{47224}{47306}He was a snob about loveliness|in things...
{47311}{47413}...about personal charm|and physical grace in people.
{47418}{47462}We always had a perfect troupe...
{47467}{47580}...of beautiful people around us|always, whenever we travelled.
{47604}{47674}- May I sit here?|- Sebastian's seat.
{47679}{47738}- Oh, well...|- No, no, please.
{47743}{47854}It's a court jester's chair.|A rare one, 500 years old.
{47863}{47919}Please, sit on it.
{47929}{48023}Say something funny.|Make me stop wanting to cry.
{48050}{48127}I'm afraid I'd make|a miserable jester.
{48137}{48222}I get concerned when|people stop wanting to cry.
{48227}{48289}Time for your medicine and daiquiri.
{48294}{48341}In that order.
{48367}{48441}Isn't it nice of the drugstore|to keep me alive?
{48446}{48479}- Thank you.|- Foxhill...
{48484}{48597}See the Hollys off the premises.|They're apt to remove the silver.
{48601}{48638}Yes, Mrs. Venable.
{48643}{48737}He would sit in his chair,|I in mine, at 5:00 every day...
{48742}{48833}...and we'd have daiquiris|with St. Sebastian brooding above us.
{48845}{48907}But you stayed here last summer.
{48913}{48997}I did. I wasn't well.|He took Catherine with him.
{49002}{49052}- And he died.|- Of a heart attack.
{49057}{49090}Was she with him?
{49095}{49209}She was there with him when he died,|and that day she lost her mind.
{49214}{49273}When will you see her, doctor?
{49281}{49334}As soon as I can.
{49347}{49461}What can I tell Dr. Hockstader|about your interest in helping us?
{49466}{49524}Can't that wait until|you've met my niece...
{49529}{49616}...and decided if you think|your operation could help her?
{49621}{49670}Yes, of course it can wait.
{49675}{49737}Surely there's no connection between...
{49742}{49853}Aren't we more interested in something|that concerns us personally?
{49862}{49907}Aren't we, doctor?
{49926}{49966}I understand.
{50032}{50080}I can find my way out.
{50094}{50194}Millions of years ago, dinosaurs fed|on leaves of those trees.
{50199}{50270}They were vegetarians.|That's why they became extinct.
{50276}{50334}They were just too gentle|for their size.
{50341}{50421}Then the carnivores,|the ones that eat flesh...
{50426}{50489}...the killers inherited the earth.
{50494}{50576}But then they always do, don't they?
{50925}{50997}Catherine.
{51018}{51092}It's Sister Felicity, Catherine.
{51105}{51172}Please get up. You're to come with me.
{52640}{52686}Catherine.
{52718}{52775}I'm not being violent, Sister.
{53208}{53271}What are you doing, Catherine?
{53338}{53382}Just smoking a cigarette.
{53392}{53521}Now, you know we're not allowed|to smoke at St. Mary's.
{53526}{53599}- Please let me smoke. Please.|- Give it here.
{53604}{53694}- Don't be such a bully!|- Disobedience has to be paid for.
{53699}{53779}- I'll pay for it later.|- Now, Catherine.
{53784}{53845}I'm putting out my hand for it.
{53851}{53910}- All right, take it!|- You burned me!
{53915}{53978}- I'm sorry...|- You deliberately burned me.
{53983}{54069}- You said to...|- You stuck the lit end into my hand.
{54074}{54162}I'm so sick of being|bossed and bullied.
{54167}{54206}I'm sick of being...
{54225}{54306}You saw that.|Saw her deliberately burn me.
{54313}{54396}- You better put something on that.|- I can't leave.
{54406}{54485}- Patients classified as violent...|- Sister.
{54490}{54586}Very well, doctor. I'll wait outside.
{54648}{54711}Just outside the door.
{54757}{54843}You're very brave|being in the room alone with me.
{54848}{54921}- Do you plan to burn me too?|- Oh, much worse.
{54939}{54997}I'm classified as violent.
{55002}{55086}I'm apt to attack you|and then accuse you of rape.
{55103}{55202}- Do you do that sort of thing?|- That's why I'm in isolation.
{55218}{55310}I molested an elderly gardener|of great virtue.
{55315}{55408}When he refused my advances,|I denounced him as a lecher.
{55420}{55482}After that, I was punished.
{55488}{55522}Was it true?
{55530}{55583}That I was punished? Yes.
{55588}{55698}- That you accused him unjustly.|- Of course I accused him unjustly.
{55703}{55742}After all, I'm insane.
{55747}{55831}It's the sort of thing|an insane woman would do.
{55843}{55977}Besides, haven't you noticed|how oddly I've been looking at you?
{55985}{56010}Have you?
{56016}{56092}How I've been staring at your eyes.
{56102}{56192}Your beautiful, blue, frightened eyes.
{56197}{56274}Why are they so frightened?|Do you need help?
{56285}{56330}Do you want help from me?
{56370}{56425}I'm making you nervous.
{56430}{56483}You have every reason to be.
{56498}{56612}Because now I'm going|to attack you. Yes, attack.
{56617}{56666}It won't be for your beauty.
{56671}{56752}No, it's for these cigarettes.|Let me have one.
{56757}{56816}Of course. Help yourself.
{56851}{56901}You are good.
{56930}{57016}- Who are you?|- I'm a doctor.
{57024}{57081}- Sent by my aunt?|- Yes.
{57086}{57173}- As I haven't responded to treatment.|- So they say.
{57178}{57289}You've been invited to try|your hand at what is a hopeless case.
{57294}{57394}Is it hopeless? What do you think?
{57457}{57524}- Where are you from?|- Lions View.
{57670}{57721}The state asylum.
{57745}{57793}Where they have the Drum.
{57798}{57884}What you call the Drum|is not a torture chamber.
{57889}{57961}It's really a recreation hall.
{57973}{58041}They'll keep me there forever.
{58046}{58116}Like an animal in a cage.
{58142}{58218}- She is merciless, isn't she?|- Who?
{58222}{58293}Aunt Violet. Why else|do you think I'm here?
{58297}{58354}Where no one can see me, hear me?
{58359}{58427}You sound as if you think|she hates you.
{58432}{58459}Doesn't she?
{58464}{58516}Do you hate her?
{58524}{58573}What, hate?
{58578}{58666}No. I don't understand what hate is...
{58671}{58744}...or how anyone could hate|and still be sane.
{58749}{58812}I really do think I am sane...
{58817}{58897}...despite considerable evidence|to the contrary.
{58902}{59048}- Your aunt, Mrs. Venable...|- Can no more help herself than I could.
{59053}{59113}Help herself? How do you mean?
{59134}{59193}You see, we all loved Sebastian.
{59198}{59305}Women, men, children, animal,|mineral, vegetable...
{59310}{59396}Sebastian was a vocation, not a man.
{59427}{59499}Poor Aunt Vi was hooked|from the beginning.
{59504}{59579}Loved Sebastian and nobody else.
{59584}{59660}She gave up everything for Sebastian.
{59665}{59710}Even her husband.
{59715}{59785}What was Mr. Venable like?
{59790}{59850}Mr. Venable was a good man...
{59855}{59936}...but dull to the point of genius.
{59967}{60020}That was Sebastian talking.
{60025}{60097}From him,|it wouldn't have sounded cruel.
{60101}{60219}When I talk like him or when Aunt Vi|talks like him, we sound heartless.
{60224}{60322}And we're not really.|Though we do terrible things.
{60327}{60401}What do you consider terrible?
{60414}{60500}Aunt Vi let her husband die|because of Sebastian.
{60505}{60576}Killed him, some people thought.
{60582}{60637}How, killed him?
{60642}{60746}Once, Sebastian decided to give up|the torments of this world...
{60750}{60831}...and become a Buddhist monk.|That was in Tibet.
{60836}{60939}He shaved his head, was given|a wooden bowl and was happy.
{60944}{60987}Till Aunt Vi came.
{60992}{61040}Why? What did she do?
{61045}{61148}Lived in a hut, even took vows,|or whatever women do.
{61153}{61261}Anything to be near him,|to get to him, to make him come home.
{61267}{61319}While there, word came.
{61324}{61404}Mr. Venable was dying.|He had to see her.
{61414}{61454}And she chose to stay?
{61477}{61571}She chose to let her husband|die alone.
{61576}{61681}If you'd known Sebastian, you'd|understand she had no choice...
{61686}{61813}...how none of us ever had a choice,|once Sebastian had decided we were...
{61822}{61861}...to be used.
{61866}{61900}Used?
{61905}{61973}You mean he used people?
{61978}{62016}Yes.
{62033}{62123}Isn't that what love is?|Using people?
{62128}{62245}And maybe that's what hate is.|Not being able to use people.
{62251}{62301}- Go on.|- Go on where?
{62306}{62349}Anywhere.
{62354}{62451}To the first memory you come to.
{62461}{62502}My first memory?
{62525}{62586}It was once at a Mardi Gras ball.
{62599}{62655}The Mardi Gras ball? Yes?
{62693}{62756}My very first memory.
{62762}{62816}It was last spring.
{62821}{62946}Before last spring,|I remember nothing. Nothing at all.
{62954}{63071}It's as if my life began|and ended that night.
{63143}{63193}Tell me about it.
{63206}{63266}At the ball...
{63308}{63404}I was taken there by some boy|who got too drunk to stand.
{63409}{63488}I wanted to leave.|My coat was in the cloakroom.
{63493}{63590}They couldn't find the check for it,|so I said, "Let it go"...
{63595}{63662}...and started out for a taxi.
{63668}{63739}Then somebody took my arm and said:
{63744}{63809}"I'll drive you home."
{63815}{63923}As we left, he took off his coat|and put it around my shoulders...
{63928}{63993}...and then I looked at him.
{63998}{64091}I don't think I've ever seen him|before then, really.
{64107}{64201}He took me home.|But he took me another place first.
{64216}{64307}Near the Duelling Oaks at the end|of Esplanade Street.
{64312}{64431}We stopped. I asked what for.
{64438}{64487}He didn't answer.
{64492}{64560}Just struck a match|to light a cigarette...
{64565}{64671}...and I looked at him,|and I knew what for.
{64722}{64853}I think I got out of the car before|he got out of the car, and we...
{64858}{64985}...walked through the wet grass|toward the great misty oaks as if...
{64990}{65046}...as if somebody were...
{65051}{65131}...calling for help there.
{65221}{65274}And after that?
{65390}{65430}I lost him.
{65462}{65541}He took me home.
{65546}{65636}Then he said an awful|thing to me. He said:
{65649}{65702}"We'd better forget it.
{65707}{65821}My wife's expecting a child, and..."
{65886}{65981}I just entered the house|and sat there thinking a while.
{65998}{66103}I called a taxi and rushed|to the Roosevelt Hotel ballroom.
{66108}{66157}The ball was still going on.
{66162}{66268}I thought I'd gone back|to pick up my coat. But I hadn't.
{66272}{66406}I hadn't gone back for that at all.|I'd gone back to make a scene.
{66411}{66513}I didn't pick up Aunt Violet's|silver fox in the coatroom.
{66518}{66630}I rushed right into the ballroom,|spotted him on the floor...
{66635}{66700}...ran up to him and started...
{66705}{66821}...to beat him in the face|and the chest with my fists till...
{66886}{66951}...Cousin Sebastian took me away.
{67010}{67056}Miss Catherine?
{67206}{67251}Miss Catherine?
{67287}{67381}She's here. Miss Catherine's here.
{67387}{67464}In spirit as well as flesh.
{67469}{67549}And now you want to play a game.|Look at pictures?
{67554}{67664}Tell you the first thing that comes|into my mind, my poor deranged mind.
{67669}{67709}All right.
{67752}{67847}That shadow on the wall.|What does it look like to you?
{67876}{67928}Like a shadow on a wall.
{67933}{67983}I thought we were gonna play a game.
{67996}{68025}All right.
{68045}{68116}I see forests.
{68121}{68178}Trees, a girl.
{68191}{68267}And those trees|are the Duelling Oaks...
{68283}{68392}...and that tormented figure|is the girl, Catherine, losing her...
{68397}{68427}...honour.
{68453}{68511}I'm trying to make you|feel sorry for her.
{68523}{68602}- I hope I am.|- I am sorry.
{68631}{68703}I believe you really are.
{68765}{68831}Tell me about your cousin, Sebastian.
{68873}{68948}He liked me, so I loved him.
{68953}{69030}How? I mean, in what way|did you love him?
{69051}{69099}The only way he'd accept.
{69199}{69292}- I tried to save him, doctor.|- Save him from what?
{69327}{69446}Completing a sort of image|he had of himself...
{69469}{69573}...as a sort of a sacrifice|to a terrible sort of a...
{69577}{69626}- God?|- Yes.
{69646}{69732}Sebastian, who was gentle, kind...
{69737}{69822}...saw something not gentle,|not kind, in the universe.
{69827}{69870}Something...
{69874}{69976}- Something terrible in himself.|- What was it? Can you tell me?
{70016}{70097}- One day at Cabeza de Lobo...|- Where?
{70163}{70258}That's where we were last summer.|That's where...
{70271}{70323}That's where Sebastian died?
{70346}{70374}Yes.
{70390}{70415}How did he die?
{70462}{70568}They say a heart attack,|but I don't remember. I really don't.
{70573}{70669}You see, afterwards,|I was hysterical, taut.
{70693}{70737}Said things I don't remember.
{70750}{70789}That's why I'm here.
{70795}{70878}Because I say things people don't...
{70883}{70953}...and then I don't even remember.
{70958}{70999}Try to remember.
{71091}{71189}You and Sebastian, last summer...
{71211}{71250}Try to remember.
{71451}{71533}The beach was very white.
{71566}{71620}Oh, how the sun burned.
{71651}{71763}It was like the eye of God|watching us.
{71775}{71828}Burning, burning.
{71854}{71909}There was no air that day.
{71914}{71983}The sun had burned up all the air.
{72007}{72107}Outside it was like inside a furnace.
{72189}{72269}- Then they came.|- Who came?
{72296}{72351}From all parts of the beach.
{72391}{72445}And that awful noise they made.
{72478}{72586}The noise of musical instruments|all made of tin.
{72601}{72633}Who is "they"?
{72691}{72759}And that, that music.
{72790}{72833}That awful music.
{72875}{72923}I hear that music!
{72943}{72993}I still hear it!
{73010}{73087}It's getting closer and closer!
{73111}{73172}Sebastian! Help!
{73253}{73371}- What happened? What happened then?|- I don't remember after that!
{73389}{73447}Stop that this minute.|Stop that noise.
{73451}{73515}- Doctor, I must see you at once.|- Get out of here.
{73525}{73607}Sister, get out and don't|come back until I call you.
{73787}{73857}I can't remember.
{73862}{73962}- I can't remember!|- It's all right.
{73971}{74076}- Don't worry, it's all right.|- But I have to, I want to!
{74082}{74116}Then you will.
{74122}{74159}Will you help me?
{74164}{74238}- Lf you let me.|- Yes.
{74342}{74385}I shouldn't have done that.
{74390}{74458}Why not?|It was a friendly kiss, wasn't it?
{74488}{74520}Maybe it wasn't.
{74546}{74600}Maybe now you'll think|that all those...
{74604}{74675}...stories about the gardener|are true.
{74680}{74735}Whatever's true, we'll find.
{75070}{75178}I want you to know that|I can look attractive...
{75191}{75241}...if I had my hair done and if...
{75283}{75347}When I'm at Lions View,|may I wear a pretty dress?
{75351}{75386}If you like.
{75459}{75557}Just imagine, once again|to be able to do...
{75562}{75627}...one thing I'd like.
{76143}{76215}Come out here, son.|I want you to see something.
{76392}{76511}Take a good long look.|Tell me, what do you see?
{76525}{76620}Old tires, tin cans,|and a "Drink Nehi" sign.
{76625}{76670}That's the past you're looking at.
{76675}{76737}Thanks to a certain young man|from Chicago...
{76742}{76799}...there'll be a new building|on that lot...
{76804}{76922}...devoted to psychosurgery, dedicated|to the memory of Sebastian Venable.
{76946}{76996}I wish I were that optimistic.
{77041}{77107}I've been working with|the lawyers and accountants.
{77111}{77159}And we're getting, listen to this...
{77164}{77267}...in big, round, beautiful figures,|$1 million.
{77272}{77363}- Just like that, no strings attached?|- No strings attached.
{77368}{77452}She wants you, and nobody else,|to do the operation on her niece.
{77457}{77533}You can't blame her for that.|There isn't anybody better.
{77582}{77667}Something horrible happened|to that girl last summer.
{77684}{77797}Some dreadful, traumatic experience|of some kind.
{77802}{77831}What?
{77843}{77897}I don't know.|I haven't found out yet.
{77915}{77991}And she refuses to allow herself|to remember.
{78006}{78071}She's gonna have to be made|to remember.
{78112}{78137}Come in.
{78145}{78183}Excuse me, Dr. Hockstader.
{78188}{78263}Mrs. Holly and her son are here|to see the new patient.
{78270}{78327}Have them wait in my office, will you?
{78331}{78385}- How's Miss Catherine?|- She looks lovely.
{78390}{78486}She had her hair done this morning.|She's wearing her own clothes.
{78491}{78591}I've never seen clothes like|that girl's got. From Paris! And...
{78608}{78683}Thank you, Miss Benson.|I'll be along.
{78703}{78788}But she's a patient. You can't|let her wear her own clothes.
{78794}{78872}I put her in the nurses' wing.|I don't want her in the ward.
{78877}{78919}The nurses' wing?
{78927}{78982}I know I'm taking a risk...
{78987}{79066}...but for a while I don't want her|to feel she's a patient.
{79071}{79170}I want her to feel she's free of|restrictions, free of being watched.
{79175}{79207}This is very unorthodox.
{79215}{79264}So is insanity.|That's why we're here.
{79269}{79352}Seems your whole approach|has little to do with neurosurgery.
{79367}{79451}- For the time being.|- That's what this new building is for.
{79459}{79555}- Dedicated to neurosurgery.|- Yes, I know.
{79560}{79666}Mrs. Venable thinks you're prepared|to go ahead with the operation.
{79691}{79726}Yes, I know.
{80097}{80147}Cathy's in there?|George, hold me now.
{80151}{80228}I'm so nervous, I could jump|clear out of my skin.
{80233}{80285}Well, don't, Mama.
{80451}{80545}- Kitten!|- Miss Benson, you can go to lunch now.
{80550}{80661}- Thank you, doctor.|- My poor baby. My angel.
{80666}{80753}- In this place.|- It's all right, Mama. I'm just fine.
{80758}{80829}You look pretty good,|Cathy, considering.
{80834}{80911}- So do you, George, considering.|- We wanted to see you.
{80916}{80986}But Violet said no,|not while you were at St. Mary's.
{80991}{81099}The doctors there didn't want|anybody to see you, so we didn't.
{81104}{81149}My, that's a pretty dress.
{81154}{81245}- When did you get that?|- In Paris. Sebastian bought it.
{81250}{81330}Yeah? I'm wearing one of his suits.
{81335}{81384}Yes, I recognize it.
{81389}{81466}Wasn't it sweet of Vi to give George|his wardrobe?
{81470}{81526}Not that she could've done|anything with it.
{81531}{81622}It's the thought behind the deed|that matters.
{81629}{81683}Have you seen Aunt Vi recently?
{81688}{81758}Yes, we saw her last night.|At her house.
{81763}{81829}She invited us to a private supper.
{81834}{81921}She's had this elevator installed.|Cutest thing you ever saw...
{81927}{81971}We've got business to talk about.
{81976}{82054}I know, son. You know|how children are. They're critical.
{82061}{82117}What did Aunt Vi say last night?
{82122}{82206}That you were|in extremely capable hands.
{82211}{82283}And I can tell they are capable too.
{82288}{82354}Mr. Brossard, the new lawyer we got...
{82359}{82427}Such a nice man too,|a tower of strength...
{82432}{82506}...in all these months|since Sebastian's been gone.
{82511}{82593}It nearly killed Violet.|I know, I was there.
{82598}{82728}You didn't see her the way I did,|grieving like a madwoman.
{82759}{82825}I mean, like her heart would break.
{82870}{82968}He was her whole life. She worshipped|the ground beneath his feet.
{82973}{83066}When she got this letter|from that place with the funny name...
{83071}{83096}What letter?
{83101}{83206}From the authorities, telling about|what happened to him at...
{83211}{83287}What was the name of that place,|honey, where he passed on?
{83295}{83334}- Cabeza de Lobo.|- That's it!
{83339}{83378}- Did you see the letter?|- No.
{83384}{83470}But I guess it told about|how he had this heart attack...
{83475}{83565}...and how Catherine was|not quite herself, poor baby.
{83570}{83643}I'm myself now, Mama.|Aren't I, doctor?
{83659}{83692}Of course you are.
{83697}{83756}Don't worry a thing about|what people say.
{83760}{83832}Nobody in the city knows about|what you've been through.
{83837}{83878}Do they, George? Not a thing.
{83883}{83945}Nobody even knows you've come back|from Europe.
{83950}{83996}When they question us|or inquire...
{84001}{84103}...we just say that you stayed abroad|to study something or other.
{84120}{84226}- Can we talk to Catherine alone?|- Yes, on a private family matter.
{84231}{84348}Just some papers gotta be signed.|Some business.
{84387}{84424}Is that all right?
{84430}{84533}Don't worry. Since I've been allowed|to smoke, I've become a perfect lamb.
{84537}{84633}My little girl was|always a perfect lamb.
{84669}{84713}Thank you.
{84907}{85006}- Cathy, Sebastian left a will.|- A generous, thoughtful will.
{85011}{85095}He bequeathed to us,|to you and to me, $50,000 each...
{85099}{85144}...after taxes are paid.
{85149}{85224}- Sebastian always was very kind.|- Isn't that the truth?
{85229}{85262}But there is a problem.
{85267}{85371}It's very complicated, but|Mr. Brossard, this new lawyer, is...
{85376}{85478}...trying to get it through probate.|- Only it won't go through probate.
{85483}{85524}- Why not?|- Aunt Vi won't let it.
{85528}{85627}Well, you see, it has to do with you.|With your being ill.
{85647}{85759}- She doesn't trust me with the money?|- 50 grand is chickenfeed to Aunt Vi.
{85764}{85848}- Then what is it?|- When you went off your rocker...
{85853}{85950}Shut up, Mama. Cathy's not|that far gone. Are you, Cathy?
{85955}{86038}- When I went off my rocker...?|- Yeah. You said something.
{86043}{86105}You made up some crazy story|about Sebastian.
{86110}{86169}- When she heard whatever it was...|- Last night...
{86174}{86261}...not a word would she say,|except that you babbled.
{86266}{86364}That's her word for it. You babbled|some story about Sebastian...
{86369}{86445}...and how he lived and...|- Died...
{86466}{86528}...in a place called Cabeza de Lobo.
{86539}{86606}What you said gave her a real turn.
{86611}{86727}When doctors decided you were crazy,|she wanted you to stay at St. Mary's.
{86732}{86824}Or even right here.|This seems such a nice place too.
{86829}{86904}- With that nice, capable doctor.|- Go on.
{86909}{86971}Written permission was needed|to keep you here.
{86986}{87079}So that was the point|of the private supper.
{87083}{87124}You've gotta understand...
{87128}{87194}This 100 grand is important to us.
{87199}{87271}It means George will have all sorts|of advantages now.
{87276}{87376}Things we couldn't give him, since 1929|killed your father and our nest egg.
{87381}{87451}Mother, you didn't sign those papers?
{87456}{87536}- You didn't commit me to Lions View?|- Not yet.
{87541}{87631}But, Cathy, the way Aunt Vi put it,|there was no choice at all.
{87636}{87668}Mama's gotta sign.
{87673}{87767}Besides, honey, it's not like|it was for always.
{87772}{87842}In no time,|after the little operation...
{87847}{87924}...you'll be able to...
{87941}{88008}What little operation?
{88013}{88053}Oh, Cathy!
{88123}{88212}There's only one little operation|they perform here.
{88217}{88293}It's on the brain.|It's called a lobotomy.
{88298}{88373}You may have heard of it|or read about it. I have.
{88378}{88452}It's that nice young doctor's|specialty.
{88464}{88536}In cases of hopeless lunacy...
{88541}{88636}...he bores holes into the skull|and operates on the brain!
{88642}{88738}Oh, honey, please don't|talk about it. Please!
{88743}{88842}- You can't let them!|- Stop. It's not the end of the world!
{88847}{88914}- Don't sign that paper!|- They say it don't hurt.
{88919}{88984}- Don't let them!|- No worse than tonsils.
{88989}{89078}And then, afterwards,|you're all right again.
{92039}{92108}Miss Catherine.
{92126}{92184}- Those faces!|- Look, for the love of...
{92189}{92283}- You get her back to her room.|- What are you doing here?
{92383}{92432}We've just come from your office.
{92437}{92522}- What is all that noise? Is it fire?|- What happened?
{92527}{92630}I don't know. We were having this chat|about your treatment.
{92635}{92723}All of a sudden my poor baby flew|out of the room and down the hall.
{92728}{92832}I'm sure it's the right thing,|what you and Violet are doing.
{92837}{92890}- It is the right thing.|- Come on, Mama.
{92895}{92953}- We're so grateful to you.|- Come on.
{92958}{92998}Having you look after her and...
{93003}{93060}Will you get me Dr. Van Vitch?
{93065}{93093}- Yes.|- Thank you.
{93216}{93280}I'm sorry they upset you.
{93285}{93362}Miss Catherine, don't ever run away.
{93367}{93436}Where will you cut, doctor?
{93443}{93558}- I'm not at all sure that I will.|- Where will you cut my brain, doctor?
{93563}{93599}In front?
{93605}{93713}Or further back?|I suppose I'm to have my head shaved.
{93733}{93830}It seems such a waste, seeing as how|I had my hair fixed this morning...
{93835}{93911}...then to have it all cut off|right after it.
{93916}{93973}I tell you, it's funny.
{94011}{94112}And you were the one who was|going to help me. Help me.
{94122}{94147}Help me!
{94152}{94189}Don't talk like that.
{94194}{94263}Why not?|Now I sound insane, don't I?
{94268}{94328}- Are you trying to?|- No, and I'm not.
{94333}{94413}You've got to believe me, doctor.|I am not.
{94418}{94505}Insane is such a meaningless word.
{94510}{94578}But lobotomy has a precise meaning,|hasn't it?
{94583}{94703}Are you going to operate? Tell me,|doctor, please, are you going to?
{94708}{94770}I don't know yet.
{94839}{94883}Poor doctor.
{94910}{94968}I bother you, don't I?
{94973}{95018}Yes, you do.
{95023}{95093}Well, I'll try not to anymore.
{95173}{95247}- Three cc, please.|- Yes, doctor.
{95252}{95308}Must I take off my pretty dress?
{95313}{95353}Of course not.
{95457}{95509}I want to help you.
{95515}{95546}Trust me.
{95572}{95638}I want to trust you.
{95646}{95752}It seems to me that|I need help very much.
{95947}{96025}- His eyes are so blue.|- Who?
{96030}{96073}The doctor.
{96089}{96144}Wonder why he isn't blond.
{96148}{96212}They usually are blond,|with eyes that blue.
{96217}{96266}- I'm blond.|- Are you?
{96271}{96366}Funny. We were going to blonds next.
{96371}{96430}Blonds were next on the menu.
{96435}{96543}You just relax now.|Let yourself go.
{96568}{96679}All last summer,|Sebastian was famished for blonds.
{96686}{96736}Fed up with the dark ones.
{96744}{96858}Famished for blonds.|The travel brochures he picked up...
{96863}{96964}...were advertisements of blond|northern countries.
{96969}{97073}Think he'd already booked us|to Stockholm and Copenhagen.
{97083}{97198}Fed up with the dark ones,|famished for the light ones.
{97206}{97308}That's the way he talked about people,|as if they were...
{97313}{97375}...items on a menu.
{97380}{97453}That one's delicious-looking.
{97458}{97521}That one's appetizing.
{97526}{97618}Or that one is not appetizing.
{97647}{97731}I think really he was half-starved...
{97736}{97815}...from living on pills and salads.
{97851}{97913}You just relax, now.
{98002}{98083}We'll fly north, little bird.
{98090}{98158}It's what he called me sometimes.
{98164}{98213}Little bird.
{98238}{98378}We'll walk under those radiant,|cold northern lights.
{98400}{98498}I've never seen the aurora borealis.
{98549}{98583}Well...
{98616}{98703}He never saw those northern lights.
{98743}{98852}Who said, "We're all of us children...
{98857}{98928}...in a vast kindergarten...
{98934}{99088}...trying to spell God's name|with the wrong alphabet blocks"?
{99617}{99648}Thank you.
{99715}{99770}Mrs. Venable, I do|want to speak with you...
{99775}{99864}Oh, this forgetfulness,|my greatest failing, doctor.
{99869}{99936}I have a little gift for you,|this book.
{99940}{99978}Thank you.
{99996}{100062}- "Poem of Summer".|- By my son, Sebastian Venable.
{100067}{100150}That volume contains only one poem,|as do the others I have.
{100155}{100238}Each with the title "Poem of Summer"|and the date of the summer.
{100243}{100307}If you like that one,|I'll bring the others.
{100312}{100353}He wrote one poem a year?
{100358}{100442}One for each summer|that we travelled together.
{100447}{100540}The other nine months of the year|were really only a preparation.
{100545}{100581}Nine months?
{100586}{100632}The length of a pregnancy, yes.
{100653}{100719}I gather the poem was hard to deliver.
{100724}{100800}Even with me. Without me, impossible.
{100805}{100922}- Doctor, he wrote no poem last summer.|- But he died last summer.
{100927}{100968}Without me, he died.
{100974}{101018}That was his last summer's poem.
{101049}{101157}Mrs. Venable, how exactly|did your son die?
{101178}{101251}I told you, a heart attack.
{101256}{101317}Is that what the letter said?
{101322}{101397}How did Catherine know|I received a letter?
{101415}{101481}Catherine? She knows very little.
{101486}{101526}She can't remember.
{101531}{101634}That's her illness. She was there,|but she can't remember.
{101639}{101719}- Mrs. Holly told me about it.|- So you've seen her too, have you?
{101723}{101780}I must say, you have been observing.
{101785}{101847}There was no letter,|only a death certificate.
{101852}{101895}- I'd like to see that if...|- Why?
{101911}{102014}I think it's important. I want to know|what happened the day your son died.
{102027}{102094}You shall have it tomorrow.
{102099}{102187}And tomorrow you shall also have|the permission to operate.
{102192}{102232}And now I'd better go.
{102237}{102296}I've got lawyers waiting for me.
{102301}{102418}You'd think giving you a building was|simple. Apparently, I must sign papers.
{102423}{102499}But I'm used to it.|Sebastian never signed anything.
{102504}{102572}- He must have suspected...|- Mrs. Venable.
{102589}{102617}Your son...
{102638}{102670}What about my son?
{102693}{102768}What sort of personal life|did he have?
{102797}{102831}He was chaste.
{102848}{102948}- You mean he was celibate?|- Yes.
{102973}{103026}You don't believe me, do you?
{103031}{103093}- Do you believe that he never...?|- Yes, never.
{103098}{103237}As strictly as if he'd taken a vow.|This sounds like vanity, doctor...
{103242}{103314}...but I was actually|the only one in his life...
{103319}{103396}...that satisfied the demands|he made of people.
{103401}{103469}Time after time, he'd let people go,|dismiss them...
{103473}{103544}...because their attitude|toward him was not as...
{103549}{103635}- As pure?|- As pure as my son demanded.
{103643}{103713}Would you want to see Catherine?
{103735}{103763}Is that wise?
{103770}{103805}It might help me.
{103811}{103867}But the lawyer.
{103872}{103951}Surely you've kept the lawyer|waiting before.
{103956}{104008}Yes, I have.
{104013}{104054}Such a strong...
{104058}{104142}...such a persuasive doctor.
{104528}{104621}She's been under sedation.|She's just coming out of it.
{104639}{104710}She looks lovely, doesn't she?
{104715}{104753}Doesn't she?
{104938}{105011}- Miss Catherine?|- Where are we going?
{105016}{105061}His eyes...
{105066}{105138}This one's eyes are so blue...
{105143}{105207}...such strange, frightened...
{105329}{105430}I'm sorry. I must have been dreaming.
{105441}{105488}Hello, Catherine.
{105578}{105676}I thought... we would have|seen each other before this.
{105685}{105754}At St. Mary's, they wouldn't|let any of us see you.
{105775}{105832}Mama was here today.
{105837}{105939}That was today, wasn't it? I lose|track of time with all these shots.
{105944}{105985}You look very well, Catherine.
{105999}{106129}Mama told me how you got her|to agree to commit me here...
{106133}{106206}...and then let them...|- She seems disturbed, doctor.
{106214}{106316}Aunt Violet! I am disturbed.
{106329}{106415}Don't you think I have|every reason to be?
{106420}{106486}Forcing my mother|into signing a paper...
{106491}{106561}I've never forced anybody|to do anything.
{106566}{106600}Oh, yes, you have.
{106605}{106648}Always.
{106660}{106717}And now you're holding $100,000...
{106721}{106806}...under Mother and George's|poor greedy noses...
{106811}{106903}...to force her to sign a paper|authorizing this doctor to...
{106909}{106998}Doctor. I see no purpose in my|remaining here listening to this.
{107003}{107068}I'll wait for you in that sun room.
{107851}{107917}Doctor, I wanted to speak|to you alone.
{107922}{107999}Miss Catherine wanted to see you again|before you left.
{108015}{108094}I didn't want to take your place|last summer.
{108099}{108157}Please believe that, Aunt Vi.
{108162}{108217}But Sebastian insisted. He said...
{108222}{108322}...you weren't well enough to travel|with him, and he couldn't travel alone.
{108326}{108427}So he insisted that I go along|with him in your place last summer.
{108438}{108489}And he died last summer.
{108539}{108655}Aunt Violet, would you like me|to tell you...?
{109127}{109196}You fell in love with Sebastian,|didn't you?
{109201}{109281}I tried to give him|what you had always given him:
{109286}{109351}The tender understanding|and the love you gave...
{109356}{109474}My son and I had a rare and wonderful|love and trust between us.
{109479}{109522}A covenant between us...
{109527}{109599}- I know about the covenant.|- He broke that covenant...
{109604}{109691}...when he took her, not me,|to travel while he created his poem.
{109696}{109781}Even when I was with him,|he'd sometimes be frightened.
{109786}{109824}But I'd know what of.
{109829}{109914}I'd reach across a table|and touch his hands.
{109919}{110021}Say not a word, just look,|and touch his hands with mine.
{110054}{110141}Then, in the morning, the summer poem|would be continued...
{110146}{110182}...until it was finished.
{110187}{110254}- I couldn't help him.|- Naturally not, he was mine.
{110258}{110306}I knew how to help him.|You couldn't.
{110311}{110342}- I tried.|- I'd force him.
{110347}{110386}All right, I failed him.
{110391}{110484}I knew that the day we flew down|to Cabeza de Lobo from...
{110489}{110541}...where he'd given off|writing his poem.
{110546}{110629}- Because he had broken...|- Yes, something had broken.
{110634}{110714}- That string of pearls old mothers...|- Old?
{110719}{110768}- Hold their sons by!|- Yes, from death.
{110773}{110817}No! Hold them from life!
{110822}{110884}You were the stranger, the destroyer.
{110889}{110950}- We were life.|- You fed on life.
{110955}{110998}Both of you. Taking!
{111003}{111138}People were objects for your pleasure.|That's what you taught each other.
{111143}{111250}- You were superior to mere mortals.|- We needed no one but one another.
{111267}{111379}Sebastian only needed you|while you were still useful.
{111384}{111478}- Useful?|- I mean young, able to attract.
{111483}{111526}She's babbling and lying.
{111531}{111597}- He left her home because she...|- You stole him!
{111602}{111648}Lost her attraction!
{111653}{111726}What would attraction have to do|with a son and mother?
{111735}{111843}- Is there no way to stop these lies?|- Yes! Have my brain cut.
{111848}{111881}This was a mistake.
{111886}{111961}The mistake was my going|with Sebastian.
{111966}{112049}- When he left her, she had a stroke.|- Not a stroke!
{112054}{112096}A hysterical stroke.
{112104}{112176}Sebastian left her home|like a toy he tired of.
{112181}{112290}And he took me with him|like a new toy. On his last voyage.
{112294}{112368}- Lies. All lies.|- You see, doctor, we both...
{112403}{112451}- We were decoys.|- Decoys?
{112456}{112531}For Sebastian. He used us as bait!
{112547}{112657}When she was no longer able to lure|the better fish in, he let her go.
{112662}{112725}Bait? For what?|What were the better fish?
{112730}{112774}We procured for him.
{112786}{112896}She'd do it in the smart, fashionable|places they went before last summer.
{112901}{113006}Sebastian was shy with people.|She wasn't. Neither was I.
{113011}{113085}But we both did|the same thing for him.
{113090}{113142}We both made contacts for him.
{113147}{113259}I can't listen to this obscenity.|Stop her, doctor.
{113263}{113352}Cut the truth out of my brain,|is that what you want?
{113357}{113434}You can't. Not even God|can change the truth.
{113439}{113495}- That we were nothing but a...|- Doctor!
{113499}{113566}- It's the truth!|- See how she destroys us?
{113580}{113640}Cut this hideous story|out of her brain!
{113645}{113741}How much are you willing|to pay for that, Aunt Vi?
{113746}{113812}Get me away from her. Out of here.
{113817}{113860}Out of this...
{113943}{114028}- Nurse, some spirits of ammonia.|- Yes, doctor.
{114033}{114082}- What happened?|- She fainted.
{114087}{114152}No. No, she didn't.
{114166}{114213}Just a little...
{114218}{114274}...dizziness, that's all.
{114279}{114370}Dr. Hockstader, will you|help me to my car?
{114375}{114505}- I don't think that's a good idea.|- Whether it is or not, I'm going home.
{114958}{115027}Tomorrow, I want that girl|operated on.
{115032}{115156}That decision belongs to the doctor|in charge, who is also the surgeon.
{115161}{115261}I don't want to hear from you again|until the operation has been performed.
{118566}{118618}No! No!
{118686}{118714}Please, no!
{118849}{118930}- You trying to ruin this hospital?|- You know better than that.
{118935}{119011}Can you imagine what would happen|to us if she'd jumped?
{119016}{119048}She was frightened. She...
{119053}{119118}Patients are here|because they can't think.
{119140}{119187}After 24 hours observation...
{119192}{119299}During which she tried to kill herself,|incited the men's day room to a riot...
{119303}{119371}- She opened that door by mistake.|- Trying to get away.
{119375}{119485}There was a riot, and she caused it.|Don't invent excuses for her.
{119490}{119542}And from that Paris clinic:
{119556}{119610}Delusions the world|was devouring her...
{119614}{119695}...that she was being raped by a man|with duelling pistols.
{119699}{119763}- The Duelling Oaks.|- Here's more of her erotomania.
{119768}{119825}At St. Mary's, they couldn't|keep her. Why?
{119830}{119886}Because of her obscenity and violence.
{119891}{119951}She sexually attacked|a 60-year-old gardener.
{119956}{120003}It was the other way around.
{120007}{120087}She tried to burn one of the Sisters|with a cigarette.
{120092}{120156}She was provoked.|I was there, I saw it.
{120161}{120236}Provoked? Who would provoke|a disturbed patient?
{120241}{120275}You'd be surprised.
{120280}{120343}And to top it, she attempts suicide.
{120347}{120427}Cogent proof of sanity,|wouldn't you say?
{120440}{120481}I need time.
{120503}{120576}When will you want|the operating room tomorrow?
{120580}{120652}I said I need more time.
{120664}{120704}I heard you.
{120815}{120902}Get me Dr. Glen Kilmer|at the Seattle Clinic.
{120916}{121005}You know I want that building|as much as you do.
{121010}{121051}I'll hold on.
{121073}{121190}Give me one more day to see if I can|break through that block to the truth.
{121195}{121239}This is a medical emergency.
{121243}{121275}I want to try something.
{121280}{121355}I want to try something tomorrow,|at Mrs. Venable's.
{121366}{121417}- Why Mrs. Venable's?|- I don't know.
{121421}{121504}I feel somehow that in that garden...
{121509}{121607}...maybe in that jungle,|we might find...
{121611}{121687}Look, you don't want Mrs. Venable|giving her money...
{121692}{121747}...to the Seattle Clinic, do you?
{121751}{121855}And you don't want anybody to be able|to say that we acted hastily...
{121860}{121915}...or unethically, do you?
{121972}{121999}Cancel the call.
{122023}{122107}But be sure you know where|I can find Dr. Kilmer.
{122908}{122959}Mrs. Venable will be right down.
{122967}{123063}- The others are here, as you asked.|- Show them into the sun room, please.
{123073}{123112}Of course, doctor.
{123155}{123183}Cathy, honey...
{123188}{123226}Later, Mrs. Holly.
{123231}{123289}Doctor, I have the things you wanted.
{123294}{123356}- In the dining room.|- Oh, thank you.
{123517}{123559}What's going on here?
{123574}{123627}Sorry to keep you waiting,|Dr. Cukrowicz.
{123631}{123708}I had to get those papers you wanted.|I mislay everything.
{123719}{123783}My son always said,|"Mother, if you..."
{123816}{123895}What are you two doing here?|And where is Dr. Cukrowicz?
{123900}{123947}Why, I thought you invited us.
{123952}{124016}Dr. Cukrowicz asked me|to ask them to come.
{124038}{124070}Of course.
{124075}{124112}Dr. Hockstader...
{124125}{124188}...I want you to meet|my sister-in-law, Mrs. Ho...
{124193}{124260}- Where is Catherine?|- In the sun room.
{124272}{124347}Could Mrs. Holly and her son|wait for us in the garden?
{124352}{124397}Of course. Foxhill?
{124407}{124478}I don't know why everybody|is being so mysterious.
{124483}{124557}I brought you some of Sebastian's|papers. Odds and ends.
{124561}{124643}- And this, the thing you wanted.|- Your son's death certificate?
{124647}{124735}- This must be painful for you.|- Lf you don't read Spanish, I have...
{124740}{124778}I read Spanish.
{124805}{124847}Well, I have a translation.
{124851}{124895}As you see,|there was no mystery...
{124899}{124979}...no matter what the girl said|at the time or any other time.
{124983}{125039}It says the body was somewhat...
{125045}{125099}...damaged in falling.|Where did he fall?
{125104}{125192}On the ground. Where else do you fall|when you die in the hot sun...
{125196}{125246}...in the street|of a godforsaken village?
{125257}{125285}Did you see his body...?
{125289}{125359}It was a primitive country.|The coffin came sealed.
{125363}{125388}Sealed?
{125396}{125427}Were there any rumours?
{125431}{125508}There were no rumours.|His heart stopped and he fell.
{125516}{125589}I'll wait in the garden now.|That is where you want me?
{125593}{125632}Yes, if you will.
{125659}{125691}Dr. Hockstader...
{125701}{125768}...let me show you my son's garden.
{125773}{125877}It's very unusual.|Like the dawn of creation.
{125943}{125991}Sebastian's garden.
{126041}{126093}I can still cry.
{126124}{126170}Am I dreaming this?
{126175}{126226}It doesn't seem real.
{126284}{126390}Would you take off your jacket?|It's time for another injection.
{126421}{126464}What is it this time?
{126483}{126552}- Something different.|- The truth serum?
{126557}{126630}Yes, except there is no such thing.
{126637}{126668}As truth?
{126673}{126703}Or the truth serum?
{126711}{126789}There is truth, all right. Somewhere.
{126799}{126831}Sit down.
{126887}{126955}Now you want me to start|counting backwards from 100?
{127015}{127121}- Do you enjoy counting backwards?|- Oh, I love it. Just love it.
{127195}{127229}100...
{127234}{127318}...99, 98, 97...
{127322}{127393}...96, 95...
{127467}{127516}I feel it already.
{127520}{127595}- How funny.|- Close your eyes for a minute.
{127907}{127962}I want you to give me something.
{127967}{128018}Name it, it's yours.
{128030}{128086}I want you to give me|all your resistance.
{128097}{128144}Resistance? To what?
{128150}{128175}To the truth.
{128207}{128283}Truth is the one thing|I have never resisted.
{128290}{128360}People think they don't resist it,|but they still do.
{128369}{128414}Sebastian said:
{128430}{128522}"Truth is at the bottom|of a bottomless well."
{128557}{128589}Why did...?
{128661}{128701}Open your eyes.
{128754}{128800}Why did you try to kill yourself?
{128851}{128903}Isn't that what everybody wants?
{128907}{128950}Me out of the way?
{128968}{129024}Mother and George|would get their money.
{129029}{129078}You'd get your building.
{129083}{129114}Aunt Vi...
{129131}{129160}Go on.
{129196}{129255}You know what I think|you're trying to do?
{129287}{129344}I think you're trying|to hypnotize me.
{129368}{129404}You're looking at me so...
{129409}{129441}...straight.
{129458}{129587}You're doing something strange|to me with your eyes. Your eyes...
{129595}{129676}- Is that what you're doing?|- Is that what you feel I'm doing?
{129690}{129755}I feel... peculiar.
{129816}{129886}It doesn't just have to do|with what you gave me.
{129978}{130023}I'm putting out my hands.
{130027}{130136}I want you to put your hands into mine|and give me all your resistance.
{130140}{130231}Pass all the resistance|from your hands into mine.
{130265}{130313}Here are my hands...
{130326}{130375}...but there's no resistance in them.
{130379}{130416}You'll tell the true story?
{130435}{130480}Yes, I'll try.
{130491}{130559}Nothing not spoken.|Everything told exactly?
{130569}{130619}Everything exactly.
{130651}{130703}Because I have to.
{130837}{130862}Can I...?
{130869}{130899}Can I get up?
{130903}{130990}Yes, of course, but be careful.|You'll feel a little dizzy.
{131029}{131062}I can't.
{131137}{131175}Tell me to.
{131189}{131228}Then I think I could.
{131233}{131273}Stand up.
{131449}{131485}Now I can.
{131502}{131608}- Oh, I'm dizzy. Help me.|- It's all right. You're all right.
{131684}{131724}Hold me.
{131728}{131780}I've been so lonely.
{131887}{131919}Let me.
{131924}{131952}Let me.
{132147}{132227}I suggest you bring her outside,|if you don't mind, doctor.
{132231}{132273}We'll be right out.
{132447}{132486}Are you ready?
{132847}{132890}Hello, Catherine.
{132914}{132950}Now, Catherine...
{132955}{133017}...you're going to tell|the true story.
{133022}{133113}- Where do I start?|- Wherever you think it started.
{133127}{133170}I think it started...
{133174}{133229}...the day Sebastian was born|in this house.
{133233}{133264}- Cathy.|- I don't mind.
{133269}{133381}Let's start later than that.|Why don't we begin with last summer?
{133386}{133414}Last summer?
{133419}{133472}Last summer. How did it begin?
{133481}{133517}It began...
{133529}{133563}...after the Duelling Oaks.
{133568}{133669}- Don't tell about that, Cathy...|- Mrs. Holly, don't interrupt.
{133689}{133739}After that happened...
{133746}{133823}...the next morning,|I started writing my diary...
{133827}{133880}...in the third person singular,|such as:
{133885}{133963}"She is still living this morning."
{133974}{134026}Meaning that I was.
{134031}{134113}"What's next for her? God knows."
{134125}{134195}I couldn't go out anywhere.
{134200}{134255}That's true.|She wouldn't leave her room.
{134260}{134294}Shut up, Mama.
{134299}{134387}I would write,|"She woke up early this morning.
{134402}{134471}She had her coffee, dressed...
{134475}{134511}...went for a brief walk."
{134520}{134572}- Who did?|- She did.
{134611}{134643}I did.
{134672}{134732}From Esplanade|to Canal Street...
{134737}{134816}...as though being pursued|by a pack of Siberian wolves.
{134833}{134933}Went through all the stop signs.|Couldn't wait for the green signals.
{134947}{135057}"Where did she think she was going,|back to the Duelling Oaks?"
{135122}{135155}Everything...
{135165}{135214}...chilly and dim.
{135243}{135279}But that hot...
{135285}{135315}...ravenous mouth.
{135331}{135383}He was a very ordinary married man.
{135393}{135418}And then?
{135459}{135550}One morning, Cousin Sebastian|came in and said, "Get up."
{135555}{135674}Well, if you're still alive after|dying, then you're obedient. I got up.
{135682}{135759}He took me down to a place|where they take passport photos.
{135780}{135843}He said, "Mother can't go|with me this summer.
{135850}{135920}You're going with me this summer,|instead of Mother."
{135925}{136020}- Except that it was her idea, not his.|- Mrs. Venable.
{136040}{136070}And your cousin?
{136087}{136147}He helped bring me back to life...
{136152}{136219}...in Paris, Barcelona, Rome.
{136223}{136316}All those lovely foreign cities|I'd never seen, we saw together.
{136320}{136390}And those...|What did he call them?
{136395}{136443}Those sunshine days...
{136447}{136535}...where it's always noon,|and we cast no shadows.
{136540}{136596}- But then...|- But then what?
{136610}{136650}At Amalfi...
{136670}{136768}...high above the Mediterranean,|in a garden, I took his arm.
{136787}{136828}You took his arm. Yes...?
{136832}{136914}It seemed like such a natural thing|to do, but he pulled away.
{136919}{137000}How he must have loathed|being touched by her.
{137010}{137112}I only did it to try and show|my appreciation for his kindness.
{137117}{137155}I didn't want to...
{137171}{137220}There was nothing else.
{137263}{137297}Anyway...
{137309}{137368}...it was there in Amalfi...
{137373}{137469}...suddenly, last summer,|that he began to be restless and...
{137491}{137531}Go on.
{137576}{137615}He couldn't go on.
{137620}{137677}He couldn't write his summer poem.
{137684}{137757}I have his notebook here. See?
{137762}{137860}Title, "Poem of Summer".|And the date of the summer: 1937.
{137865}{137963}And after that, blank pages,|blank pages. Nothing but nothing.
{137967}{138021}A poet's vocation rests|on something...
{138025}{138077}...as fine and thin as a spider's web.
{138085}{138142}It's all that holds him|out of destruction.
{138147}{138195}Very few are able to do it alone.
{138199}{138261}Great help is needed.|I did give it. She didn't.
{138265}{138320}She's right about that.|I failed him.
{138324}{138380}I wasn't able to keep|the web from breaking.
{138384}{138435}I saw it breaking,|I couldn't save it.
{138440}{138535}Now the truth's coming out. Maybe|she'll admit what really happened.
{138541}{138619}- What did happen?|- How she killed him.
{138623}{138690}How she murdered him|at Cabeza de Lobo. Ask her.
{138820}{138866}What did really happen?
{138878}{138935}Suddenly, last summer...
{138940}{138989}...he wasn't young anymore.
{138994}{139037}We went to Cabeza de Lobo...
{139045}{139117}...suddenly, he switched|from the evenings to the beach.
{139124}{139157}Evenings to the beach?
{139167}{139272}I mean, from the evenings|to the afternoons.
{139277}{139377}Suddenly, Cousin Sebastian changed|to the afternoons in the beach.
{139386}{139454}What kind of a beach was it?|Was it a public beach?
{139459}{139497}Yes, public.
{139502}{139565}Little statements like that|give her away.
{139585}{139679}After all I've told you about his|fastidiousness, can you accept...
{139683}{139774}...that Sebastian would go to some|dirty public beach near a harbour?
{139779}{139855}Whatever she wants to say,|I want her to say it.
{139870}{139897}Go on.
{139911}{139972}I don't want to go on.
{139977}{140089}Every afternoon, you and your cousin|would go to this free public beach?
{140104}{140206}It wasn't the free one.|The free one was right next to it.
{140211}{140268}There was a fence|between the free beach...
{140273}{140347}...and the beach that we went to|that charged admission.
{140351}{140410}Did anything happen there|that disturbed you?
{140441}{140486}- Yes.|- What?
{140491}{140573}He bought me a bathing suit|I didn't want to wear.
{140578}{140626}I laughed.|I said, "I can't wear that.
{140631}{140708}Why, it's a scandal|to the jaybirds."
{140713}{140768}What do you mean?|Was this suit immodest?
{140773}{140875}It was a one-piece bathing suit.|Made of white something.
{140880}{140933}But the water made it transparent.
{140938}{141005}I told him I didn't want|to swim in it...
{141010}{141095}...but he just grabbed my hand|and dragged me into the water...
{141099}{141142}...all the way in...
{141147}{141217}...and I came out looking naked.
{141222}{141308}Why did he do that?|Do you know why he did that?
{141313}{141350}Yes.
{141355}{141452}- To attract attention.|- Because he thought you were lonely?
{141465}{141541}Did he think he could shock you|out of your depression?
{141559}{141647}You know why I was doing it.|I told you.
{141651}{141713}I was procuring for him.
{141746}{141822}Sebastian was lonely, doctor.
{141827}{141933}That empty blue jay notebook|got bigger and bigger.
{141938}{141996}So big, it was big and empty...
{142000}{142095}...like that big, empty,|blue sea and sky.
{142151}{142256}And before long, when the weather|was warmer and the beach so crowded...
{142261}{142326}...he didn't need me anymore|for that purpose.
{142344}{142455}The ones from the free beach climbed|over the fence or swam around it.
{142475}{142575}So now he let me wear|a decent dark suit.
{142579}{142657}I'd go to a faraway end|of the beach and write post cards...
{142661}{142746}...and letters and keep up|my third person journal...
{142751}{142850}...until it was time to meet him|outside the bathhouses on the street.
{142867}{142942}He would come out... followed.
{142957}{142996}Who'd follow him?
{143001}{143116}The hungry young people that climbed|over the fence from the free beach.
{143144}{143210}He'd pass out tips among them,|as if they'd all...
{143215}{143308}...shined his shoes|or called taxis for him.
{143313}{143376}Each day the crowd got bigger...
{143381}{143454}...noisier, greedier.
{143459}{143535}At last, we stopped going out there.
{143540}{143632}And after that? After you stopped|going to the public beach?
{143637}{143667}Then one day...
{143672}{143782}...a few days after we'd stopped|going out to the beach...
{143787}{143859}...it was a blazing white day.
{143864}{143973}Not a blazing hot blue day,|but a blazing hot white one.
{143988}{144091}We had a late lunch at a shabby,|lonely restaurant by the sea there.
{144096}{144154}Sebastian was white as the weather.
{144159}{144277}He had on a white silk suit,|a white tie, a white Panama.
{144285}{144382}And he kept touching his face|and his throat here and there...
{144387}{144435}...with a white silk handkerchief...
{144439}{144514}...popping little white pills|into his mouth all the time.
{144518}{144615}I knew he was having a bad time with|his heart and that it frightened him.
{144620}{144667}"Let's go north," he kept saying.
{144671}{144771}"I think we've done Cabeza de Lobo.|I think we've done it, don't you?"
{144776}{144811}I thought we'd done it.
{144815}{144892}Then there were those children|along the beach...
{144897}{144987}...which was fenced off with wire|from the restaurant.
{144991}{145092}Our table was less than a yard away|from the wire fence.
{145097}{145149}And those children...
{145153}{145209}There was a band of them.
{145213}{145269}They looked like a flock|of plucked birds...
{145274}{145334}...and they came darting up|to the wire fence...
{145338}{145398}...as if they'd been blown|there by the wind...
{145402}{145465}...by the hot, white wind|from the sea.
{145470}{145555}They were all calling out,|"Pan! Pan! Pan!"
{145560}{145599}They were calling for bread?
{145604}{145667}They made gobbling noises|with their mouths...
{145671}{145743}...stuffing their fists|into their mouths and making...
{145747}{145829}...gobbling noises|with frightful grins.
{145855}{145958}We were sorry we'd come to the place,|but it was too late to go.
{145963}{146004}Why was it too late to go?
{146009}{146135}I told you. Cousin Sebastian|wasn't well. His eyes looked dazed.
{146139}{146212}But he said, "Don't look|at those little monsters.
{146216}{146275}Beggars are a social disease|in this country.
{146279}{146343}If you look at them,|you get sick of the country.
{146347}{146409}It spoils the whole country for you."
{146441}{146481}Go on.
{146539}{146572}Go on.
{146672}{146712}Go on.
{146725}{146783}I am going on.
{146788}{146873}The band of children began|to serenade us.
{146878}{146938}- Began to what?|- Play for us on instruments...
{146943}{147032}...make music, if you|could call it music.
{147037}{147142}Their instruments were the instruments|of percussion, know what I mean?
{147147}{147215}Yes, instruments of percussion,|like drums.
{147220}{147336}As far as I could make out in|the white blaze of the sand beach...
{147341}{147433}...the instruments were tin cans|strung together...
{147438}{147499}...and bits of metal,|other bits of metal...
{147504}{147580}...that had been flattened out|and made into...
{147592}{147641}- Into what?|- Cymbals, you know?
{147655}{147717}- Brass plates hit together.|- That's right.
{147722}{147823}Tin cans flattened out|and clashed together. Cymbals.
{147839}{147935}The others had other things.|All sorts of things.
{147940}{148059}Things that they'd made or picked up|on the beach to make a sort of noise.
{148084}{148147}A music made out of noise.
{148151}{148178}Go on.
{148182}{148239}I am going on.|Nothing could stop me now.
{148244}{148339}Your Cousin Sebastian, was he|entertained by this concert?
{148344}{148396}- Terrified of it.|- Terrified, why?
{148401}{148490}I think he recognized some|of the musicians.
{148495}{148527}Some of the boys.
{148546}{148601}Between childhood and older.
{148606}{148664}Did he complain to the manager|about it?
{148677}{148765}What manager? God?|You don't understand my cousin.
{148775}{148800}How do you mean?
{148835}{148934}He accepted all as how things are...
{148939}{149057}...and thought nobody had any right|to complain or interfere whatsoever.
{149062}{149150}Even though he knew what|was awful was awful...
{149155}{149204}...that what was wrong was wrong.
{149209}{149322}He thought it unfitting to ever take|any action about anything whatsoever...
{149327}{149414}...except to go on doing|as something in him directed.
{149419}{149491}What did this something in him|direct him to do?
{149495}{149597}He suddenly pushed himself|away from the table and said:
{149601}{149675}"They've got to stop.|Make them stop. I'm not a well man.
{149679}{149755}I have a heart condition.|It's making me sick."
{149760}{149843}That was the first time that|Cousin Sebastian ever attempted...
{149847}{149911}...to correct a human situation.
{149916}{150031}I think that|that was his fatal error.
{150035}{150144}He stalked out of the restaurant after|throwing paper money on the table.
{150149}{150202}He fled from the place.
{150206}{150231}I followed.
{150235}{150343}It was all white outside.
{150347}{150404}White hot. A blazing white hot, it...
{150409}{150507}You followed Sebastian out of the|restaurant onto that hot, white street?
{150512}{150544}Running along the beach...
{150549}{150620}- You ran along the beach?|- No, no. We didn't.
{150625}{150663}We didn't move either way.
{150721}{150828}I rarely made any suggestion,|but this time I did.
{150833}{150872}What did you suggest?
{150877}{150976}Sebastian seemed to be paralysed|near the entrance at the café.
{150982}{151056}So I said, "Let's go."|I remember I said:
{151062}{151144}"Down that way is the harbour,|we're likely to find a taxi there.
{151150}{151231}Or why don't we go back in|and have them call us a taxi?
{151236}{151298}Oh, let's do! Let's do that.|That's better."
{151303}{151404}And he said, "Are you mad?|Go back in that filthy place? Never!
{151409}{151500}That gang of kids shouted vile|things about me to the waiters."
{151505}{151572}I said, "Well, let's go down|towards the harbour.
{151577}{151691}Let's not try to climb that hill|in this dreadful heat."
{151695}{151761}And Cousin Sebastian shouted,|"Please shut up!
{151766}{151864}Let me handle this situation, will|you? I want to handle this thing."
{151897}{152004}And he started up the steep street|with a hand stuck in his jacket...
{152009}{152107}...where I knew he was having|a pain from his palpitations.
{152112}{152227}But he walked faster|and faster in panic.
{152232}{152271}The faster he walked...
{152276}{152350}...the louder and the closer it got.
{152355}{152423}- Closer what got?|- The music!
{152427}{152489}- The music again?|- The music!
{152494}{152553}The noise of the following band.
{152558}{152638}They were following.|They were following...
{152643}{152707}...up the blazing white street.
{152712}{152819}Up. Straight up. That was the only|way open, so he went that way.
{152826}{152893}He tried to escape from those streets?
{152898}{153000}He tried to escape|from those streets...
{153004}{153124}- He couldn't find a way out?|- He couldn't find a way out.
{153129}{153179}Did the band of children...?
{153183}{153257}When he tried to escape...
{153266}{153308}...from those streets...
{153325}{153431}...down those little side streets,|between the buildings...
{153435}{153496}...they came from everywhere.
{153501}{153559}So the only way was up.
{153564}{153613}The only way was straight up...
{153618}{153665}...up those steep, white streets...
{153670}{153776}...in the sun, that was like a great|white bone of a giant beast...
{153780}{153830}...that had caught on fire in the sky.
{153835}{153892}And Sebastian kept|running straight up.
{153896}{153956}I don't know how he still ran.|He never ran...
{153960}{154020}...but he ran and he ran and he ran...
{154025}{154085}...where it was whiter and emptier.
{154090}{154123}What was emptier?
{154128}{154211}The light. The sky and the light.
{154215}{154336}Those steep, white streets and the sun,|and everything blazed white and empty.
{154340}{154407}Where did those streets lead to?
{154411}{154436}Nowhere!
{154440}{154465}He never reached...?
{154470}{154582}He never reached the end.|They stopped nowhere! Never!
{154587}{154647}Except, except...
{154651}{154695}- Except?|- At the...
{154704}{154763}At the very top of the hill.
{154767}{154876}Something. A place, a ruin.
{154881}{154928}Broken stones. Like...
{154933}{154960}Like what?
{154965}{155051}Like the entrance...
{155055}{155147}...to a ruined temple...
{155151}{155240}...some ancient ruined temple...
{155245}{155312}...which he entered.
{155355}{155415}And they...
{155422}{155468}...overtook him.
{155527}{155576}There, in that...
{155591}{155662}And you, Catherine,|what did you do then?
{155692}{155748}I heard Sebastian scream.
{155843}{155900}He screamed just once.
{155935}{155964}Then I...
{156042}{156085}Then I...
{156108}{156159}Help!
{156185}{156243}Help!
{156253}{156293}Help!
{156312}{156347}And then? Then?
{156351}{156407}I ran. They let me run.
{156411}{156468}- They didn't even see me.|- Run where?
{156472}{156497}Down.
{156502}{156574}The waiters, police, people...
{156579}{156654}...ran out of buildings,|back up to where...
{156659}{156750}...to where Cousin Sebastian...
{156799}{156903}He was lying naked...
{156908}{156974}...on the broken stones.
{157013}{157091}And this you won't believe.
{157095}{157213}Nobody, nobody could believe it.
{157292}{157356}It looked as if...
{157361}{157442}...as if they had devoured him!
{157469}{157535}As if they had torn or cut...
{157540}{157624}...parts of him away|with their hands...
{157639}{157775}...or with knives or those jagged|tin cans they made music with.
{157806}{157888}As if they'd torn bits of him away...
{157892}{158024}...and stuffed them|in their own gobbling mouths!
{158091}{158207}There wasn't a sound anymore.
{158211}{158288}There was nothing...
{158321}{158379}...but Sebastian...
{158443}{158553}...lying on those stones...
{158558}{158663}...torn and crushed.
{158920}{158962}Oh, Cathy.
{159087}{159127}Mrs. Venable.
{159263}{159312}There you are.
{159317}{159361}I thought you were still on deck.
{159366}{159475}And where's your hat?|Oh, dear, you'll get fever.
{159479}{159557}A whole day up there in the rigging|in the hot sun.
{159562}{159646}Watching those awful, hungry birds.
{159651}{159725}I don't know what you see|in such terrible sights.
{159730}{159813}It's too much for both of us,|my darling.
{159818}{159872}That horrible sun.
{160573}{160616}Of course God is cruel.
{160621}{160721}We didn't need to come to the|Encantadas to find that out, did we?
{160725}{160767}We've always known about him.
{160771}{160883}The savage face he shows to people,|and the fierce things he shouts.
{160888}{161007}It's all we ever see or hear|of him now. Nobody seems to know why.
{161015}{161042}The difference is...
{161046}{161130}...we know about him, the others don't.|That's where we're lucky.
{161134}{161170}Go rest, my darling.
{161175}{161223}Look out for that fever.
{161227}{161332}I'm going to see the captain and tell|him to change our course for home.
{161337}{161399}Oh, Sebastian.
{161404}{161495}What a lovely summer it's been.|Just the two of us.
{161499}{161542}Sebastian and Violet.
{161547}{161591}Violet and Sebastian.
{161596}{161659}Just the way it's always going to be.
{161664}{161726}Oh, we are lucky, my darling...
{161730}{161803}...to have one another|and need no one else, ever.
{162139}{162242}There's every possibility|that the girl's story is true.
{162375}{162437}George, tell her she's got|to come home with us.
{162441}{162491}- Doctor?|- Catherine will be all right.
{162495}{162555}- Can she come home?|- Don't worry, she will.
{162559}{162655}- Why don't you take your mother?|- Sure. Come on, Ma.
{162907}{162932}Miss Catherine?
{162959}{163005}She's here, doctor.
{163049}{163099}Miss Catherine's here.
