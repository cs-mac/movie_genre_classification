I still think
it's too low.

I want her
all to myself. It's very distracting.

Will you give me--
You want the camera?

Yes.

00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,480
I guess I'm not.

501
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,984
I'm just not used
to driving Steve's car.

502
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:25,486
Why didn't we take ours?

503
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,740
He said just
to take his.

It's not my fault,
is it?

514
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:24,545
No, no, don't
be ridiculous.

515
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,798
A little bit?

516
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,802
No, don't even
think that way.

517
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:34,806
I should have done
something...

In class,
he seemed so nice,

even when somebody did
something really dumb.

521
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:44,816
I hope he hasn't
screwed up your head

522
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,818
like he screwed up mine.

Come on, let's go.

Chris, I'm sorry.

No, he can't get back here

Yes.

Hello,
Chris. Hi.

And, Kathy?
Hello, Sister.

00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:17,658
Martin...
Go with Sister.

539
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:20,161
Kathy, we're having

Go, Kath.

KATHY:
Thanks for treating me like a child.

CHRIS:
God, if I could only say what I feel.

00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:42,183
What do you feel?

545
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:44,685
Anger.

546
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:48,189
Goddamned anger.

547

Yeah, okay.

551
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,197
And him?

552
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,202
A lot more than anger.

553
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:03,204
That's right, love.

554
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:07,208
Keep your head down,
take a deep breath.

555
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,711
Breathe deeply, dear.

556
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:16,217
My mother and father...

I've been thinking
about them.

When they died...

559
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:26,727
I was at Mary Elizabeth's
house--

560
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:30,231
my friend.

561
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:34,735
They were coming to pick me up.

562
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:37,739
They crashed.

563
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:40,241
They got in a crash.

564
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:46,748
I felt...

565
00:32:46,748 --> 00:32:50,251
It was worse.

566
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:52,753
I mean, it was different.

567
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:58,259
But it...
it was sort of like now.

568
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:10,772
The police, they asked her
such awful questions.

569
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:15,776
No question about it?

570
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:16,778
CHRIS:
No.

571
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:18,780
This is the man that raped you?

572
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,781
Yes.

573
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:25,286
What are you so quiet for,
Miss McCormick?

574
00:33:25,286 --> 00:33:26,787
Nothing to shout about.

575
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:28,790
Yeah, I know,
but you sound uncertain,

576
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,791
and that worries me.

577
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:32,543
Are you sure this is the guy
that raped you?

578
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:33,544
I'm sure.

579
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,047
I told the police
why he was there.

580
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,549
Yeah, I know.
You invited him.

581
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,801
He's a teacher
at Kathy's school.

582
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:41,803
I have all that.

Yes?

There's a gentleman here
to see Miss McCormick.

Was it raining
in Seattle?

Let me see.

594
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,082
She lives alone, huh?

595
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,084
With our kid sister.

596
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,085
And that's it?

00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,586
Yeah.

598
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,472
Have they got the guy?

599
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,974
Yes.

600
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,595
Please come in,
Father.

601
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,596
I'm Carla Bondi.

602
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,097
Where have you
got the guy?

603
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,600
Please, sit down.

604
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,106
Mr. Stuart is in jail,

605
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,609
but we can only keep him
there for 48 hours.

606
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,611
Then he's got
to be released,

607
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,613
unless we decide
to prosecute.

608
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,866
And we won't decide
to prosecute

609
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:46,367
unless <i>you</i> decide
to testify.

610
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:47,869
Now, do you understand that?

611
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,372
Well, you,
you should.

612
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:53,374
You should, sure.

613

Good.

615
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:00,514
Do you think I should testify?

616
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,017
Yes, of course I think
you should testify--

617
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,518
you've been raped.

618
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,772
Miss McCormick,
every human being

619
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:12,276
has the right of simple
consent-- even women.

620
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,895
But I must tell
you something.

621
00:35:14,896 --> 00:35:16,647
If you plan to go ahead
with this,

622
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,650
you better be prepared to be
abused again in court.

623
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,400
What do you mean?

624
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,403
I mean that his
lawyer's going

625
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:23,654
to try to terrify you,

626
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,657
degrade you, control you,
humiliate you.

627
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,160
Why do you think there are only
10,000 rapes reported every year

628
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,662
in California?

629
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,663
MARTIN:
<i>Only</i> 10,000?

630
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,665
Out of no less than
50,000 committed, Father.

631
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,301
What is it, Mr. Edison?

632
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,303
Do you want to ask me something?

633
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,921
Uh, yes, I do.

634
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,925
What chance is there the rapist
will actually go to prison?

635
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:47,428
Two out of 100 serve time.

636
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:51,432
So, even if Chris goes through
all that, there's no guarantee?

637
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:52,683
Never a guarantee.

638
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,070
What's in this for you,
Mrs. Bondi?

639
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,188
What do you mean?

640
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,573
Well, what I mean is,

641
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,577
I think there's a hell of a lot
you can get out of this--

642
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,194
we know there is.

643
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:04,695
I think you're
ambitious, aren't you?

644
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,697
Aren't you?

645
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,698
Yeah, but I'm not...

646
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,199
Come on, Steve.

647
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:16,456
I... I thought you
wanted me to press charges.

648
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,459
EDISON:
I do. I-I did, but...

649
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,462
Oh, look, this is
going to get ugly.

650
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:23,213
It <i>was</i> ugly.

651
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:26,467
I know.

652
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:29,470
But taking him
to court--

653
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,972
what's that going
to do for you?

654
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:34,976
Aw, look, things have been going
so beautifully, haven't they?

655
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:37,228
I mean, you're
the hottest model in the country.

656
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,729
The agency's happy.

657
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,230
If you go ahead
with this thing,

658
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,732
that's all going
to be wiped out.

659
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,234
And for what?
You're going to win this case,

660
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,486
and you're going
to feel worse.

661
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:46,988
Excuse me.

662
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,490
You know, she doesn't win
the case.

663
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,992
The People of the State
of California do--

664
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:53,995
to protect them from a rapist.

665
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:56,130
Chris McCormick
is a witness, that's all--

666
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,133
in the People's case
against Gordon Stuart.

667
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,385
If we have a case.

668
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,886
Oh, what...?

669
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,389
Mrs. Bondi, what do you mean,
"If we have a case"?

670
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,891
There's enough evidence,
isn't there?

671
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,393
Gordon Stuart is
one of the People

672
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,894
of the State of
California, too.

673
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,264
And we owe him his case.

674
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:17,768
And his case says...
here's a pretty woman

675
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,771
who, let's say,
comes on... and on,

676
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,273
and then
changes her mind.

677
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:24,775
What?

678
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,777
All right, she has a right
to change her mind...

679
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,278
but then she cries rape.

680
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,281
I didn't encourage him.

681
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,782
I told him to get out.

682
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,533
Yeah, but that can sound like,
"Come on in."

683
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:34,668
You didn't
throw him out.

684
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,670
It was too late to call...

685
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,171
When did it get
to be too late?

686
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,422
When it began to feel good?

687
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,923
It never did!

688
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,425
Gordon says you loved it.

689
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,042
He's a liar.

690
00:37:42,543 --> 00:37:43,043
It was horrible.

691
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:44,929
Let's go, Chris. Come on.

692
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,798
He forced me down, and made me
smear lipstick all over...

693
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,299
Aw, drop it,
Chris.

694
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,552
Isn't that what you do?

695
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:53,053
Peddle lipstick?

696
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:54,805
Isn't that
what you do, too?

697
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,690
You hard sell her
all over this country.

698
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,694
And we're allowed to look
and we're allowed to buy,

699
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,195
but don't touch.

700
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,697
And all it takes for rape
is one man like Gordon Stuart.

701
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,816
Why should Chris McCormick
risk all the good luck

702
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,317
she's had
just to...?

703
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,320
Because it happened to her!

704
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,321
( <i>sighs</i> )

705
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,323
And because she can help.

706
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,825
All right, so you
know what you want.

707
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,328
Steven, you know
what <i>you</i> want.

708
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:19,580
But what do
you want, Chris?

709
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,583
He wanted to kill me with it.

710
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,584
BONDI:
With what? That's enough, damn it!

711
00:38:24,085 --> 00:38:25,086
With his cock!

712
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:30,091
I hate him! I hate him,
and I want him to die in jail!

713
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:32,093
I want them to do it
to him in jail!

714
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,980
( <i>crying</i> )

715
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,482
Okay.

716
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,984
I'm sorry I had
to do that to you,

717
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,486
but I had to find out.

718
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,489
You're going to be
a terrific witness.

719
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,491
And we'll get
a conviction.

720
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,786
Oh, here they are.

721
00:38:58,786 --> 00:39:01,171
REPORTER:
There they are up there. Okay.

722
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:03,290
Where's
the boyfriend?

723
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,176
He's not coming in.

724
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,679
REPORTER 2:
Is that Steve Edison, the boyfriend?

725
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,681
Miss McCormick, have
you had any contact

726
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,182
with Gordon Stuart
since the alleged rape?

727
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,684
No.

728
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,686
Not even at
the pretrial investigation?

729
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,054
Father McCormick,
are you willing

730
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,189
to give a statement
on this matter?

731
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,559
Mr. Stuart-- you supposedly
saw him attack your sister?

732
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,194
He was your music teacher
at school, wasn't he?

733
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,697
Do you think he was a nice man,
Kathy?

734
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,469
Any statement,
Miss McCormick?

735
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,225
Button your blouse.

736
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,726
Don't let
the newsmen see it.

737
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,632
BONDI:
What did you do then?

738
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,134
KATHY:
Nothing. I just cried.

739
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,636
Then we called the police.

740
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:44,141
I had to dial the number
'cause Chrissy couldn't see.

741
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,642
Thank you, Kathy.

742
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,145
Sorry I had to
put you through it all again.

743
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,279
Your witness,
Mr. Cartright.

744
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,781
CARTRIGHT:
Kathy, what time

745
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,283
did you get home from
school that afternoon?

746
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,786
KATHY:
About the time I usually get home.

747
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:58,405
You usually get home from school
at the same time?

748
00:40:58,405 --> 00:40:59,906
I sometimes stop
at a friend's.

749
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:01,408
It was quite often.

750
00:41:01,408 --> 00:41:03,159
Four out of five afternoons
the previous week.

751
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,661
So your sister might
easily have assumed

752
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,663
you might be late
that afternoon.

753
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,665
BONDI:
I object, Your Honor. I don't think so.

754
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,917
Counsel is asking Kathy to state
what was in her sister's mind.

755
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,169
Sustained.

756
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,420
Kathy, in direct testimony,

757
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,923
when you were questioned
by the deputy district attorney,

758
00:41:16,924 --> 00:41:18,926
you testified he was raping her.

759
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:21,428
Do you know what it means,
the word "rape"?

760
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:27,183
It's when somebody puts force
on somebody to have sex.

761
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,069
If your sister hadn't told you
she'd been raped,

762
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,571
from what you saw, would you
have been able to determine

763
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,073
if it was done
without her consent?

764
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,074
BONDI:
Objection. Objection.

765
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,076
JUDGE:
Objection sustained.

766
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,579
CARTRIGHT:
Now, Kathy, if she had said nothing to you that afternoon,

767
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,583
would you have thought that
the behavior of the defendant

768
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,700
and your sister,
in her bed,

769
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,202
constituted this crime?

770
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,203
BONDI:
Objection.

771
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:46,836
The witness is not competent

772
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,339
to determine
what constitutes a crime.

773
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,456
Yes, I am.

774
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:50,840
JUDGE:
Sustained.

775
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:54,211
You said you opened
your sister's door,

776
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,712
and saw her on the bed

777
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,715
with Mr. Stuart.

778
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,717
When you looked through
that door,

779
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:00,718
was she struggling?

780
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,102
She was tied up.

781
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,604
Ah, but, Kathy, your sister's
a very strong woman.

782
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,107
You think that somebody,
all by themselves

783
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,358
could have tied her up?
BONDI: Objection, Your Honor.

784
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,227
That calls
for speculation.

785
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,728
JUDGE:
Sustained.

786
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,234
If he had a gun or a knife.

787
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,736
Kathy, did you see a knife
in the defendant's hand?

788
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,739
Did you see a gun?

789
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,243
Still, she was tied up,
wasn't she?

790
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,748
Do you like to read?

791
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,753
Yes. I like to read.

792
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,255
Do you sometimes read books
you're not supposed to?

793
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,389
Books on the list?

794
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,891
KATHY:
Sometimes.

795
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,643
Have you read a novel
entitled <i>The Story of O?</i>

796
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,145
No.

797
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,646
Have you heard
of it?

798
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,648
Yes.

799
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,149
From friends?

800
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,650
One friend.

801
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,152
So you know
from this friend

802
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,405
that there are people
who derive sexual pleasure

803
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,157
from being
physically restrained.

804
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,160
Tied up. Some of them
even enjoy being beaten up.

805
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,529
Not my sister.

806
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:04,280
The answer to my question,
though, Kathy, is...

807
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,783
Not my sister.

808
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:07,534
Please, Your Honor.

809
00:43:08,035 --> 00:43:09,036
Let it pass, Mr. Cartright.

810
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:10,537
You've made your point.

811
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:12,672
Not my sister.

812
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,176
CARTRIGHT:
<i>Miss McCormick,</i>

813
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,045
surely you have experienced
oral copulation in the past.

814
00:43:19,046 --> 00:43:21,048
BONDI:
The witness' sexual history is inadmissible.

815
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:22,549
JUDGE:
Objection sustained.

816
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:24,300
I hope I haven't
given the impression

817
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,303
that I believe you
to be a promiscuous person.

818
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,304
I object.

819
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,307
Well, yes, you did,
by your questions.

820
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,058
Then I want to state
quite emphatically

821
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:33,560
that Mr. Stuart's defense

822
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,562
does not depend upon
your promiscuity.

823
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:37,196
I object to these
gratuitous comments

824
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,698
by the defense attorney.

825
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,817
Sustained.
This is cross-examination,

826
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,319
Mr. Cartright, not argument.

827
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,071
Mr. Bailiff,
could you get the board, please?

828
00:43:45,072 --> 00:43:46,573
Your Honor,

829
00:43:46,573 --> 00:43:47,824
I have defense exhibits

830
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,827
which I've already marked
"B" through "G,"

831
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,829
and which I believe
Mrs. Bondi has already seen.

832
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,332
If it please, Your Honor,
may we approach the bench?

833
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,835
Yes, you may approach.

834
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:02,589
I object, Your Honor,

835
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:05,091
to the introduction
of these photographs.

836
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:06,593
On what grounds, Mrs. Bondi?

837
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:08,094
As not being relevant
to the case.

838
00:44:08,095 --> 00:44:09,596
JUDGE:
Mr. Cartright?

839
00:44:09,596 --> 00:44:11,598
CARTRIGHT:
At least one of these frames is from a film commercial

840
00:44:11,598 --> 00:44:12,982
that was photographed

841
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,985
the day before
the alleged attack.

842
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,486
Now, it's acknowledged

843
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,989
that Mr. Stuart was
present on that occasion.

844
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,490
They'll be received in evidence.

845
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,993
Proceed, Counselor.

846
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,995
Now, this is a frame
from the film commercial

847
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,998
that was photographed the day
before the alleged attack.

848
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,499
Is that correct?

849
00:44:29,616 --> 00:44:31,117
BONDI:
Objection. Yes.

850
00:44:31,118 --> 00:44:32,369
These are rejects
out of hundreds,

851
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,870
perhaps thousands,
of work prints.

852
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,372
They're called outtakes,

853
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,374
and they're not meant
for general distribution.

854
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,375
( <i>gavel pounding</i> )

855
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,376
JUDGE:
Overrulled.

856
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,878
Are spectators normally
permitted to watch the filming?

857
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,380
No. Not from close.

858
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,382
But Mr. Stuart
was present, was he not?

859
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,015
CHRIS:
Yes.

860
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,517
CARTRIGHT:
So he must have been there

861
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:48,518
by your invitation.

862
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,020
CHRIS:
No. Well, he was going...

863
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,022
CARTRIGHT:
No, just answer the question.

864
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,523
Was he there at
your invitation?

865
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,893
Yes.
And you knew he was there

866
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,778
when you posed
like this?

867
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:02,649
It's my work,
and I do what I'm told.

868
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:03,650
Everything you're told?

869
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,653
If you were told to perform
certain sexual acts...?

870
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:07,787
Objection, Your Honor.

871
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,289
That's argumentative
and irrelevant.

872
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,790
JUDGE:
Sustained.

873
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,660
I want you to look
at this frame once again--

874
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,663
remembering, of course,
that it's one frame

875
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:19,165
from a long,
slow, continuous action--

876
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:21,168
and I want you
to tell me--

877
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:24,171
we're none of us here
experienced with this...

878
00:45:24,171 --> 00:45:25,672
with this kind of work--

879
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:28,174
can you tell me
how someone managed

880
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:29,676
to look as
seductive as this?

881
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,678
As suggestive
as this?

882
00:45:31,678 --> 00:45:34,430
Do you have
to think certain things?

883
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,567
Bring certain
images to mind?

884
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,569
Yes.

885
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,570
Images of men,

886
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,571
I assume?

887
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,072
Yes.

888
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,573
And these are
really meant

889
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,076
to make you hot,
isn't that true?

890
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,077
Excite you a bit?

891
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,695
Very well.
A little.

892
00:45:49,196 --> 00:45:50,697
Sexy thoughts
that are meant...

893
00:45:50,697 --> 00:45:51,698
I object, Your Honor.

894
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:52,699
That's vague
and ambiguous.

895
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:53,700
JUDGE:
Objection overruled.

896
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,701
I'm going to allow that.

897
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:55,702
Answer the question.

898
00:45:55,702 --> 00:45:57,203
What's the question, please?

899
00:45:57,204 --> 00:45:59,206
Do you use
sexy thoughts

900
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:01,208
to make you
a little bit hot?

901
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:03,210
Thoughts of oral sex?

902
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:08,214
Yes.

903
00:46:09,216 --> 00:46:10,350
Sodomy?

904
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,851
No.

905
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,103
No. Oral sex, yes.
Sodomy, no.

906
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,104
BONDI:
I object, Your Honor.

907
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,105
That's not a question.

908
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,106
Sustained.

909
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,108
Do you have daydreams
of being overpowered?

910
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:18,858
Objection.

911
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,360
JUDGE:
Overruled.

912
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,612
Sometimes.

913
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,616
So the answer is yes.

914
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,118
Yes. Yes.

915
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,121
So, one afternoon,
you invite this young man

916
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,624
to watch you
going through these

917
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,126
erotic daydreams
of being raped...

918
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,127
Objection.

919
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:38,629
of being overwhelmed...

920
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:42,132
to see these sexual fantasies
on the beach-- helpless,

921
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,751
half naked,
lusting.

922
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:45,752
And, the very next afternoon,

923
00:46:46,253 --> 00:46:47,754
you invite this young
man to your apartment.

924
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:51,007
The man of your choice,
in the place of your choice.

925
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:51,892
And you expect this jury
to believe

926
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,893
that he had to brutalize you...

927
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,894
Objection!
to make you perform these sexual acts?!

928
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,013
JUDGE:
Sustained! Objection!

929
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,016
I have only one
more question, Miss McCormick,

930
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,018
and I believe
the jury has only one more question:

931
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,770
In spite of everything,
were you sexually aroused?

932
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,521
Objection! Objection!
Objection! Objection!

933
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:06,773
And did you not,
in fact, reach a sexual climax?

934
00:47:07,274 --> 00:47:08,275
Objection!
No! No!

935
00:47:08,775 --> 00:47:10,777
JUDGE:
Sustained. Jury will disregard both question and answer.

936
00:47:10,777 --> 00:47:13,529
Your Honor, it must
be made absolutely clear

937
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,533
that there has been
no admission of orgasm.

938
00:47:16,783 --> 00:47:18,785
And, in any case, such
a reaction would have no bearing

939
00:47:18,785 --> 00:47:20,787
on whether or not a crime
has been committed!

940
00:47:20,787 --> 00:47:22,789
JUDGE:
Do you have any further questions,

941
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:24,540
Mr. Cartright?

942
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,043
No, Your Honor.

943
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,179
JUDGE:
Any redirect, Mrs. Bondi?

944
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,681
BONDI:
Yes, I certainly do.

945
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,937
Did you pose in this manner

946
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,941
because you knew that
Gordon Stuart was present?

947
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,059
No.

948
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,062
Why was he present?

949
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:47,564
My sister had him come

950
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:52,068
because she wanted me
to hear some of his music.

951
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:55,572
BONDI:
So then you did not, in fact, personally invite him?

952
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,074
No. I only told her

953
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,078
that she could bring him
if she wanted to.

954
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,579
( <i>crying</i> )

955
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,581
Then will you tell us why...

956
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,583
on this occasion...

957
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,220
you allowed yourself
to be photographed like this?

958
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:14,724
I'm... I'm a model.

959
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:15,842
You mean you sell yourself?

960
00:48:15,842 --> 00:48:17,844
Your body, your dreams,
your fantasies?

961
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:18,845
No.

962
00:48:18,845 --> 00:48:20,096
What do you sell?

963
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,099
Lipstick.

964
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,100
To men?

965
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,101
To women.

966
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,488
Then why like that?

967
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,239
( <i>sighs</i> )

968
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,742
'Cause I'm supposed to look like

969
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,746
what every... woman
wants to look like.

970
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,747
( <i>sighs</i> )

971
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,248
( <i>murmuring</i> )

972
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:42,252
STUART:
<i>I'm not proud</i> <i>of what happened--</i>

973
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:43,370
what I did.

974
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,873
But I love to teach;
it's my career.

975
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:50,376
And I need a job,
it's a job, too.

976
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:54,380
It's the, it's the teaching.

977
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:56,383
What did you do?

978
00:48:56,383 --> 00:48:59,886
I said, "You'll have to show me
what you want."

979
00:48:59,886 --> 00:49:02,638
CARTRIGHT:
Then what happened?

980
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,140
STUART:
She said...

981
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,143
"It'll be
my pleasure.

982
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,144
( <i>murmuring</i> )

983
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,645
( <i>bangs gavel</i> )

984
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,647
She led me into the bedroom.

985
00:49:10,897 --> 00:49:12,398
She, uh...

986
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:19,656
she had, uh... soft silk,
silk s-scarves

tie her with so that
they would leave no marks.

would be...

Carla... can't you do
something about him?

992
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,303
Please, please.
Will you stop him?

Rape is an act of violence,

998
00:49:41,428 --> 00:49:43,430
But she wanted this violence,
and...!

00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,682
She's...

1000
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,067
She's... she's a beautiful,
lovely woman

1001
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,569
and I-I-I'd look at her,

1002
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,571
and I'd <i>want</i>
<i>to make love to her.</i>

1003
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:52,572
But love!

1004
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,074
In an affectionate way, not...

1005
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,083
She wants something else.

Do you recognize this

It's her bedroom.

Chris McCormick's
bedroom?

1023
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,319
Yes.

1024
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,821
A mess, isn't it?

1025
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,442
These pictures
on the floor.

1026
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,944
Tell me, how did
they get smashed?

1027
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,449
You happen
to remember?

1028
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,453
Um, no, it was...

1029
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,955
There was a lot
going on.

1030
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:33,456
Yes, of course.

1031
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,958
But I was just
wondering what part

1032
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,960
of Chris McCormick's
sexual perversion

1033
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,961
is satisfied by
the smashing

1034
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,462
of family
photographs?

1035
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,464
I wouldn't know.

1036
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,965
But you did
smash them. No.

1037
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,967
Well, I must have
misunderstood.

1038
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:46,219
I thought all the
acts of violence--

1039
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:49,222
sheets ripped, smeared
with lipstick and blood,

1040
00:51:49,222 --> 00:51:50,723
mirrors smashed--

1041
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:51,858
weren't they
all done by you

1042
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,860
for Chris McCormick?
No, no.

1043
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,112
Well, I was sure
that's what you testified.

1044
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,732
Shall I have it read back?

1045
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,126
I did do all that.

1046
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,627
For her.

1047
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,629
I just don't remember

1048
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:13,746
smashing the priest's picture.

1049
00:52:13,747 --> 00:52:15,749
Who's picture?

1050
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:18,001
A priest?

1051
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:21,504
I can't make out any priest.

1052
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,639
Her brother's a priest.

1053
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,640
How do you know that?

1054
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,641
She told me.

1055
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,642
Why?

1056
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,011
I don't know. Ask her.

1057
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,013
Did you ask about him?

1058
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,014
No.

1059
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,516
Then, uh, how did
he get brought up?

1060
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:34,768
I don't remember.

1061
00:52:34,768 --> 00:52:36,269
And you don't
remember

1062
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:37,770
how his pictures
got smashed.

1063
00:52:37,771 --> 00:52:39,272
No.

1064
00:52:39,272 --> 00:52:40,773
Now, about the music.

1065
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:43,276
How you doing?

1066
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:44,777
Pardon?

1067
00:52:44,778 --> 00:52:47,280
With the music--
how far along are you?

1068
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,283
No, you don't understand.
I-I just teach music.

1069
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:51,417
Oh, I see. So, you are
not a composer,

1070
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:52,919
and you are not a player.

1071
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:57,673
No. Uh, yes. I do some
composing for myself.

1072
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,926
Well, perhaps that's why
you wanted Chris McCormick

1073
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:00,927
to hear your tape.

1074
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,044
Why?

1075
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:05,548
Well, she might be in
a position to help you.

1076
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:07,551
I didn't...

1077
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,552
I didn't think about that.

1078
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:11,554
Well, think about it now.

1079
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,306
CARTRIGHT:
Objection, Your Honor.

1080
00:53:13,306 --> 00:53:14,807
JUDGE:
No, I'm going to allow it.

1081
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:20,814
Well, uh...

1082
00:53:20,814 --> 00:53:23,817
I suppose she could get my stuff
to the right people.

1083
00:53:23,817 --> 00:53:26,069
Ah, so you haven't quite
given up, have you?

1084
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:28,321
I guess not.

1085
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:31,207
You took this

1086
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,210
to Chris McCormick's
apartment that afternoon.

1087
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,211
Yes, ma'am.

1088
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,212
To play this tape.

1089
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,213
Right.

1090
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,714
And this tape you made?

1091
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,833
I did.

1092
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:40,583
I can't quite make out

1093
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,085
what you've written
here on the side.

1094
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,587
Can you make that out?

1095
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,222
I know the tape.

1096
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,724
What's it called?

1097
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,727
You did name it,
didn't you?

1098
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,729
I mean, after all
it is your, um,

1099
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,230
your fabrication.

00:53:59,853 --> 00:54:01,354

That's an
interesting title.

1108
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,249
Is it from something,
a poem?

1109
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,117
It's from me.

1110
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,501
If it please the court,

1111
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,003
I would like to play

1112
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,505
some of Mr. Stuart's music
for the jury.

1113
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,374
Do you have any objections,
Mr. Cartright?

1114
00:54:21,374 --> 00:54:24,377
I'm a great admirer
of the defendant's composition,

1115
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:25,878
Your Honor, but is it relevant?

1116
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:28,882
Very relevant, Your Honor,
and it's all set up.

1117
00:54:28,882 --> 00:54:30,016
You may proceed.

1118
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,517
The machine is a little small,

1119
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,519
so I've made arrangements

1120
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,521
to have it plugged into
another speaker or two

1121

for all of us to hear.

1122
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:39,642
What setting do you suggest,
Mr. Stuart? Six decibels?

1123
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,778
It was done
for eight.

1124
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,279
Eight.

What were you doing
while it played?

1131
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,443
Listening.
What do you think?

1132
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:31,827
Was she listening, too?

1133
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,829
Yes.

1134
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,830
All the time?

1135
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,701

It wasn't for me.

Nothing.

1147
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,472
What did she do?

1148
00:56:01,975 --> 00:56:04,978
She... she went into
the bedroom with him.

1149
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,732
With the phone, you mean.

1150
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,233
No. Yes.

1151
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,870
She took the phone
into the bedroom.

1152
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,123
Couldn't she have asked him
to call back if she was busy?

1153
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,624
Maybe she had
to talk to him.

1154
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,126
Maybe she was glad
the call came.

1155
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,127
Is that possible?

1156
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,128
That's her business.

1157
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,130
Get her off the hook
and away from the noise.

1158
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,632
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1159
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,134
How did you feel,
Mr. Stuart?

1160
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,135
Who cares?

1161
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,138
Hell, noise.
The music's good.

1162
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,140
If she doesn't want to listen,
it's her damn loss.

1163
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,141
Yes, it is,

1164
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,143
but I asked you
how you felt.

1165
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:40,146
Weren't you furious
that she ran out on you?

1166
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,148
CARTRIGHT:
Objection, Your Honor. No.

1167
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,149
JUDGE:
Overruled.

1168
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,650
Isn't that why
you punished her,

1169
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,153
because you knew
she wasn't interested in you or your music?

1170
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,154
No, no!

1171
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,155
Because she'd rather
talk to somebody else

1172
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,157
and be with somebody else
than this music of yours?!

1173
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,158
Listen!
That's all, Mr. Stuart.

1174
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,659
You can play my music all day
and all night,

1175
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,162
and it won't make me into a man
who will rape anybody!

1176
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,663
I have no further
questions, Your Honor.

1177
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,665
And it won't convict me of rape!

1178
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,282
JUDGE:
You may step down, Mr. Stuart.

1179
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,791
Uh, I don't know
the rules here, Your Honor.

1180
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,793
Who do I tell--
If it please the court...

1181
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:10,927
Mr. Stuart.

1182
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,296
It happened the way I said.

1183
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:14,680
Tell them!
Your Honor!

1184
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,049
The prosecution provoked
this outburst, Your Honor,

1185
00:57:16,049 --> 00:57:17,433
by harassing the defendant!

1186
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,435
Why? Why, Chrissy, why?

1187
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,302
Why did you do it?

1188
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,304
JUDGE:
Mr. Stuart, will you restrain yourself?

1189
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,305
( <i>banging gavel</i> )
Why?

1190
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:23,189
Bailiff!

1191
00:57:24,557 --> 00:57:25,057
It could've been s...

1192
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:35,318
( <i>gavel bangs</i> )

1193
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:36,819
If it please the court,

1194
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,824
the defense wishes to recall
a single prosecution witness

1195
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,826
for further cross-examination.

1196
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,577
Which witness,
Mr. Cartright?

1197
00:57:44,577 --> 00:57:47,830
Miss McCormick, Your Honor.

1198
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,965
Miss Kathy McCormick.

1199
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:52,835
JUDGE:
Has the prosecution any objection?

1200
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,838
Uh, none, Your Honor,
except it is unfortunate

1201
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,339
to subject a young person

1202
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:57,973
to needlessly painful,

1203
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,476
sometimes pointless questioning.

1204
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,980
I can assure you, Mrs. Bondi,
no pointless questions.

1205
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,616
You're still
under oath, Kathy.

1206
00:58:23,616 --> 00:58:25,117
Yes, sir.

1207
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,123
You had your own key
to the apartment, did you?

1208
00:58:30,123 --> 00:58:31,124
Yes.

1209
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:34,627
So that afternoon
you let yourself in.

1210
00:58:34,627 --> 00:58:36,128
Yes.

1211
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:37,630
Now,

1212
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,381
please tell us again
what you saw and heard

1213
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,384
the moment you closed
the door behind you.

1214
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:45,271
Nothing.

1215
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,272
It was quiet.

1216
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:49,275
It was quiet?
No sounds at all?

1217
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:52,778
Some music...
coming from somewhere.

1218
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:56,783
In the apartment?

1219
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,284
I'm not sure.

1220
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:01,787
Was it coming from
your sister's bedroom?

1221
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,790
I couldn't tell.

1222
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,291
What happened
next, Kathy?

1223
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,546
I said, "I'm home."

1224
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,047
You called out?

1225
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,049
Yes, but not loud.

1226
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,550
Why not?

1227
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:19,422
Sometimes Chrissy takes a nap
in the afternoon.

1228
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:23,809
CARTRIGHT:
I see. That's how quiet it was.

1229
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,679
Now, when your sister
didn't answer you,

1230
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:28,180
what did you do?

1231
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:30,683
I went to look
into Chrissy's room.

1232
00:59:30,683 --> 00:59:33,569
Why?

1233
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:38,191
( <i>sighs</i> )

1234
00:59:38,191 --> 00:59:40,693
You went toward
your sister's room.

1235
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:41,694
Why?

1236
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,948
KATHY:
I went out on the terrace...

1237
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,950
I opened that door.

1238
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,957
And I saw her.

1239
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:57,843
Saw them.

1240
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,847
And then I went
back to my room.

1241
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,848
Did you close
your sister's door first,

1242
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:03,850
before you went
back to your room?

1243
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:04,850
Yes.

1244
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:05,851
Why?

1245
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:08,354
I just did.

1246
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,857
Well, why
do you think?

1247
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,360
I don't know. Privacy.

1248
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:15,978
For your sister's privacy?

1249
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:19,866
It was closed before,
so I just closed it again.

1250
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,371
And then you telephoned the
police from your own bedroom.

1251
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,872
No.

1252
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,375
You didn't telephone the police?

1253
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,743
No.

1254
01:00:30,743 --> 01:00:32,745
Or call downstairs
for some help?

1255
01:00:32,745 --> 01:00:33,746
I should have.

1256
01:00:33,746 --> 01:00:35,247
But you didn't,
did you?

1257
01:00:35,248 --> 01:00:37,250
'Cause you didn't believe
your sister was in danger.

1258
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,501
That's the truth,
isn't it?

1259
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:39,635
Did you think for an instant

1260
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,637
your sister was being harmed?

1261
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,005
I didn't know.

1262
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,506
You would have
called for help

1263
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,007
if she'd been
in danger. Yes.

1264
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,010
You would have
telephoned the police. Yes.

1265
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,011
Anyone,
wouldn't you?

1266
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,012
Yes.

1267
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:51,264
But from what you saw,
she wasn't being harmed.

1268
01:00:51,264 --> 01:00:52,898
She wasn't struggling.

1269
01:00:53,266 --> 01:00:54,267
She wasn't
being beaten.

1270
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:55,268
She didn't scream.

1271
01:00:55,768 --> 01:00:57,770
She was quiet,
wasn't she?

1272
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:00,273
You looked into your sister's
bedroom, Kathy,

1273
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:01,774
and you saw her making love.

1274
01:01:01,774 --> 01:01:03,776
In some way,
she wanted to make love,

1275
01:01:03,776 --> 01:01:05,778
with a teacher
you liked and admired.

1276
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:07,780
No, he was raping her.

1277
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,782
BONDI:
Objection. This calls for a conclusion.

1278
01:01:09,782 --> 01:01:12,284
He was raping her!

1279
01:01:12,285 --> 01:01:14,287
JUDGE:
Sustained.

1280
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,541
You did like Mr. Stuart,
didn't you, Kathy?

1281
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:20,793
It's not true.

1282
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,295
You didn't like him?

1283
01:01:23,796 --> 01:01:25,297
No.

1284
01:01:25,298 --> 01:01:26,299
Didn't you?

1285
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:30,303
No. Yes, but...

1286
01:01:30,303 --> 01:01:32,805
Did you like him
or didn't you?

1287
01:01:32,805 --> 01:01:34,306
He raped my sister.

1288
01:01:34,307 --> 01:01:36,809
No, you mean your sister
told you she'd been raped.

1289
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:37,944
He raped her.

1290
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,946
Look, that is the
accusation, Kathy,

1291
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:40,947
but Mr. Gordon Stuart

1292
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,448
is not guilty of rape.

1293
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,950
That requires evidence,
and there is no evidence.

1294
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:45,818
You were an
eyewitness, Kathy,

1295
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:47,319
but you didn't see
anything violent

1296
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,821
or you would have
called the police.

1297
01:01:48,821 --> 01:01:49,822
BONDI:
Your Honor, I demand

1298
01:01:49,822 --> 01:01:50,956
that you admonish counsel

1299
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,458
to stop using
this child as a tool

1300
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,459
for his closing argument!

1301
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,960
A jury, not
this witness,

1302
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,463
will determine that
violence was done,

1303
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:00,215
that Chris McCormick was raped.

1304
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,968
Your Honor, I agree that there
was a rape that afternoon

1305
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,470
in Miss McCormick's apartment.

1306
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,473
From this evidence, from the
testimony of the one eyewitness,

1307
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,474
it is impossible to tell,

1308
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,976

He was raping her!

He was!

Your Honor, I have
no more questions.

1312

She told me!

Your Honor,
I have no more questions.

1314

She told me!

She never lies to me!

We have, Your Honor.

happened, Miss Bondi?

Will anyone hire
you after this?

Will you
continue to model?

Gordon Stuart!
Yeah.

1329
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,405
Gordon Stuart,
can we have a picture

of you
and Chrissy together?

1331

How does it feel
to be a free man?

1332
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,910
Mrs. Bondi, have you had it
with the D.A.'s office?

1333
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,412
I've had it
with 18th century juries.

1334
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,917
How about a retrial?

What do you want?
What do you want?

You want to follow them
in the ladies' room?

You want more rape?

Come on, come on.
Just trying to get in.

Do you still believe
Chris's story?

1341

We're certainly innocent.

a little bit.

Try a little
harder, Chrissy.

Just remember
the way we used to do it.

to do, though.

to cool it,

to finish it today.

But they fired you.

You said.

It's okay.

It's not just a question

There's a lot more to it

Starving.

1402

We'll be the first sister team
to make a living by starving.

We couldn't starve.

Why not?

Chris?

01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,431
Mm-hmm.

1410
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,934
Will they take him back
at school?

1411

You heard the verdict.

Not guilty.

1413
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,825
They'll probably
throw him a party.

1414
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,828
How could they believe him?

1415
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:03,945
Even the kids

1416
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:05,697
at my new school.
What?

1417
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:09,201
They look at me.

1418
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:11,086
You know, funny.

1419
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:28,354

didn't he?

1420
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,222
Yeah, right.

1421
01:08:30,222 --> 01:08:32,224
Steve.

1422
01:08:32,224 --> 01:08:33,225
Steve, who said

1423
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:35,727
I was the hottest
model in the business.

1424
01:08:35,728 --> 01:08:39,364
And the jury
agreed with him.

1425
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,869
Why didn't the jury believe you?

1426
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,382
Kathy...

1427
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,887
I have to ask you a question.

1428
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:06,391
After the jury--
what they said,

1429
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:10,763
do you think maybe it...
it didn't happen?

No.

1431

KATHY:
How long is it going to take this time?

1432
01:09:29,114 --> 01:09:30,865
Don't worry about it.

1433
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:32,868
We'll have
plenty of time

1434
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:36,371
to get to the
mountains afterwards.

1435

When are you
going to know?

1436
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:39,875
Know what?

1437
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,376
If we come
back to L.A.

1438
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:43,128
or go home
to Colorado.

1439
01:09:43,128 --> 01:09:45,130
Well,
in the mountains,

1440
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:47,132
there'll be
some fresh air,

1441
01:09:47,132 --> 01:09:49,634
and then we'll
be able to make

better. Right?

How are you?

1446
01:10:13,158 --> 01:10:14,409
Good to see you.

1447
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:15,911
Where have you been?

1448
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,414
Can you come
watch us rehearse?

1449
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,416
No, I'm here with Chris.

1450
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,918
She's working.

1451

We're doing

It's really neat.

1453
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,423
Come on. Can't you
come watch us rehearse?

1454
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,426
Come on, Kathy.
Come on. Please?

1455
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,560
Kathy, come on!

1456
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,179
Please?

1457
01:10:34,179 --> 01:10:36,181
No, I've got to be with Chris.

1458
01:10:36,181 --> 01:10:38,183
Okay. We'll see
you later, okay?

1459
01:10:38,183 --> 01:10:40,568
Bye!

1460
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,571
What time you going
up to the mountains?

1461
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,072
Right afterwards.

1462
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,574
When we're
finished shooting.

1463
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,693
I'll bet you can't wait
to get out of here.

1464
01:10:47,693 --> 01:10:49,194
Marvelous! Marvelous!

1465
01:10:49,194 --> 01:10:51,196
In five years,
I'll hire you.

1466
01:10:51,196 --> 01:10:54,082
There! Now, let's see.
What can I do?

1467
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,585
There! Like Dietrich.
Marlene Dietrich.

1468
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,087
Very languorous. Dietrich.

1469

Oh, this is the most

That's it. Just

Oh, she just got bored.

She's up exploring
the place.

Just check everything,

01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:19,694
Gordon?
Huh?

1636
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:21,696
You should be
very proud.

1637
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,197
It's going to be
a knockout.

1638
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:36,461
CHILDREN:
Bye, Mr. Stuart!

1639

( <i>keys jingling</i> )

1640
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:51,285
( <i>gunshot</i> )

1641
01:25:32,076 --> 01:25:33,961
( <i>rifle clicking empty</i> )

( <i>rifle clicking empty</i> )

1643

( <i>handcuffs clicking</i> )

1646
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:35,390
CARLA BONDI:
<i>I did not leave the district</i> <i>attorney's office</i>

1647
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,392
<i>to extenuate</i>
<i>the crime of murder.</i>

1648
01:26:37,392 --> 01:26:39,894
<i>I'll tell you what Clarence</i>
<i>Darrow wrote some time ago.</i>

1649
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:45,399
<i>"Crime is to be expected,</i>
<i>since humans are never perfect,</i>

1650
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:50,905
<i>"but the failure of justice</i>
<i>may be more damaging to society</i>

1651
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:52,907
<i>than crime itself."</i>

1652
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:57,912
<i>Then where is law and order?</i>

1653
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:00,915
<i>I say your verdict to acquit</i>
<i>Chris McCormick</i>

1654
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:05,419
<i>is</i> law and order...

1655
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,923
...and justice.

1656
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:12,426
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your attention.
