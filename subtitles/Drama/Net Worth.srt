1
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:13,612
A
J&H Entertainment
Release

2
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:42,612
Well, thanks for the information.
I appreciate it.

3
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:46,165
There's no chance a mistake
could've been made? A misreading?

4
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:48,759
Human error? It happens.

5
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:52,955
Oh. Well, that sort of
rules that out then, doesn't it?

6
00:00:53,022 --> 00:00:55,543
So this really is reality.

7
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:02,102
Mr. Secretary, your car.

8
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:04,444
Oh, yes. Thank you.

9
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:20,155
Eddie, let's take the parkway.

10
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:28,791
Okay, buddy. Final offer.
Nonnegotiable.

11
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:31,448
For every buckle-down hour
you give Algebra Two...

12
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,814
you get two with quality time
with Nintendo and Sega.

13
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,419
Deal? Just whatever you do,
don't tell your mother.

14
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:41,876
Good. Now, put her back on.

15
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:48,408
Okay, hon. Number-one son
back on the straight and narrow.

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,703
Me? Fine. Just needed
a little field trip to clear the head.

17
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:55,157
Bit of a nightmare day.

18
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:59,356
I'll see you in a bit.
You bet.

19
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:01,279
I love you, Liz.

20
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,961
This is a very dynamic game,
Mr. Dapina.

21
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:36,158
You can be honest, Angela.
This game is as bloody as it gets.

22
00:03:36,227 --> 00:03:38,496
Believe me,
the kids will eat this up.

23
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:41,017
First, tell me what keeps crashing
the damn thing.

24
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:48,920
You have been virused, Mr. Dapina,
and a not so very nice one.

25
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,297
You're the best.
I knew I could count on you.

26
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:52,890
What should we do?

27
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:55,777
Don't hit the escape key
on any of your systems for a while.

28
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:57,697
One keystroke will wipe out
your whole system.

29
00:03:57,762 --> 00:04:00,993
I don't know how these things happen.
I just ordered that security program.

30
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,481
What's it called?
Gatekeeper?

31
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:05,977
That's what they all say.
Did you install it?

32
00:04:06,052 --> 00:04:09,150
Absolutely.
The minute we got it, I think.

33
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,708
Everything's under control.
It's gonna be okay.

34
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,806
You're the best. Will we be able
to get this in stores by week's end?

35
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:18,047
Absolutely.
Everything but the virus.

36
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:21,465
A friend of mine collects them.
I don't know, some people save string.

37
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,889
You are a genius, Angela.
I can't thank you enough.

38
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,582
You might think differently
once you get my bill from Cathedral.

39
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:31,330
Whatever it is, it's worth it.
I'd love to show you my appreciation.

40
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,666
Take you out to dinner tonight,
some drinks.

41
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,675
Get you out of the house.

42
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:38,171
Oh, I'm very flattered
and appreciative, but I...

43
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,153
You gotta eat.

44
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:43,392
Unfortunately, I already
have dinner plans, so...

45
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,526
How about tomorrow?
The next day?

46
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:49,913
These plans are kind of
a standing arrangement.

47
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,858
But I appreciate it.
Thank you.

48
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:55,137
- You're still the best.
- I'll speak to you soon. Bye-Bye.

49
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:09,055
Large.

50
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,093
Garlic?

51
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:16,578
Thank you.

52
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:04,062
No one leaves the house anymore.

53
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:06,306
No one has sex.

54
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,993
The net is ultimate condom.

55
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:14,113
Come on.
Talk like that, Iceman...

56
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:16,834
could lead to the eventual
extinction of our species.

57
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:20,678
My sympathies exactly, Angel.

58
00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:22,784
Let's have a date and procreate.

59
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:26,303
Not me. In two days,
I'm off on vacation.

60
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:31,460
Just me, the beach and a book.

61
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:36,358
I'm there, babe.
Look no further.

62
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:38,879
Sorry. Not my type.

63
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:43,780
I'm crushed.
So what do you want in a man?

64
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,310
Butch.

65
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:50,879
Beautiful.

66
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,453
Brilliant.

67
00:06:57,544 --> 00:06:59,486
Captain America...

68
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,870
meets Albert Schweitzer.

69
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,935
Spends all day dashing into fray...

70
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,613
while making world...

71
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,780
safe for democracy.

72
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:20,999
At night, playing Bach cantatas...

73
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:25,222
while curing cancer.

74
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,802
Settle for a guy
who puts the seat down?

75
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:32,546
Listen, Angel, you're dreaming.

76
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,432
- You're one of us.
- We accept you.

77
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,601
We accept her.
You're one of us.

78
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:38,818
One of us.

79
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:42,980
Yeah, I know.

80
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,905
It's beautiful.

81
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,036
- I love Chopin.
- You know this piece?

82
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:22,823
Well, I should.
You taught it to me.

83
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,817
Brought you something.

84
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:33,891
Just don't let the nurses
eat it all this time.

85
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:37,159
My favorite.
How did you know?

86
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:45,763
Do you wanna...
We could play it together.

87
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,888
I'm going on vacation
for about a week to the Yucatan.

88
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:21,259
If for any reason
you need to get in touch with me...

89
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:25,100
I don't know if they have phones there,
but you can talk to one of the nurses...

90
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,205
You must be one of my students.

91
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,862
No, Mom.
My name's Angela.

92
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:37,575
Can you bring me some candy
when you come again?

93
00:09:40,556 --> 00:09:43,851
- My favorites are those...
- Almond Roca.

94
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,251
Yeah, I know
what your favorites are.

95
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,422
- Angela Bennett!
- Who is it?

96
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:02,731
- FedEx.
- Coming.

97
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:06,595
Thank you for using our reservation
service. Have a pleasant flight.

98
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:15,436
Line five, please.

99
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,965
- Oh, I have another one going out.
- Okay. Here you go, ma'am.

100
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,100
And here's your virus, Dale.

101
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:35,876
- Can I use your pen?
- Yeah, sure.

102
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,358
This is a nice place.

103
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:41,126
Thanks.

104
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,932
- Have a nice day, ma'am.
- You too.

105
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:18,571
Mozart's Ghost!
The hottest band on the Internet.

106
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:29,486
- Cathedral Software.
- Dale Hessman, please.

107
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:30,762
Please hold.

108
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:33,898
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Angela.

109
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:38,027
Angela? FedEx had you signing
for that disk three minutes ago.

110
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:40,398
- What took you so long?
- I was having way too much fun...

111
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:42,766
with this Mozart's Ghost.

112
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:47,087
By the way, I sent you a whopper
of a virus for your hall of fame.

113
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:49,541
Just be a little careful
with the escape button.

114
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:53,926
Look, here's the problem.
Pop yourself into concert information.

115
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,277
All right.

116
00:11:56,945 --> 00:12:00,906
Houston Utilities. Dale, I think
you took a wrong turn here.

117
00:12:00,977 --> 00:12:04,392
Not quite Ticketmaster, is it?
See anything unusual?

118
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:08,712
No, looks like a normal web page to me,
except for that...

119
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:10,891
little icon at the bottom
of the screen.

120
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,295
Click on it, and then
press control-shift.

121
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:23,304
- My God.
- So, what do you make of all this?

122
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:25,515
Simple.
It's a programming glitch.

123
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:28,520
It's a futzed keystroke that sent you
the wrong Internet address.

124
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:32,489
Last night it sent me to Amtrak's
central mainframe and the Mayo Clinic.

125
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:34,472
Neither of them
are on the same subnet.

126
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,329
Angela, I've accessed
a system I shouldn't have.

127
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:40,558
If someone gets ahold of that disk,
they'd have an awful lot of power.

128
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,244
Why don't you just crawl in there,
find the program error and delete it?

129
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:45,681
Not quite ready to do that yet.

130
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:48,812
Look, what's your day like tomorrow?

131
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:50,889
Oh, no. No.

132
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:53,929
I'm going on my first vacation
in six years.

133
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:56,904
I just confirmed my reservation.
There are no refunds.

134
00:12:56,978 --> 00:13:00,394
- What time is your flight?
- 12:00. But I have to pack.

135
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,888
I'm gonna be a complete madwoman.

136
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:06,126
- Why don't you wait till I get back?
- I don't think so.

137
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:09,543
- Just tell me what this is about.
- I'd rather not on the phone.

138
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:13,449
I can fly down tonight in my Cessna,
be there by breakfast.

139
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:15,694
We'd have five hours.

140
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:17,901
You know this shit
better than anyone.

141
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:23,401
Fine. Fine.
I'll see you at 7:00.

142
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,599
Great. So,
they finally get to meet.

143
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,739
I'll be the tall guy.

144
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:34,416
I'm gonna be the one with "Spineless
Simp" tattooed to her forehead.

145
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:37,070
Bye. See you tomorrow.

146
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:41,742
Why do I do this?

147
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:47,730
Burbank Tower.
Cessna 739 Mike Bravo.

148
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:51,724
Intercepting approach course
I. L. S., runway eight.

149
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:56,723
Three-nine Mike Bravo,
we've lost radar contact.

150
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:58,795
Say your position and altitude.

151
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:02,512
Just passing the middle marker
at 1,300 feet.

152
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,363
Three-nine Mike Bravo,
that's a negative.

153
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,730
Verify your position
and check your instruments.

154
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:10,699
All normal, for crying out loud.
You must be able to see my lights.

155
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:14,515
That's a negative.
Execute a missed approach immediately.

156
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:16,915
Contact approach control on 124.5.

157
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,915
Okay, Burbank, but still
everything looks ok...

158
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,483
Shit!

159
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:23,466
God!

160
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:11,251
- Cathedral Software.
- Hi. Russ Melbourne, please.

161
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:14,963
- One moment, please.
- Mozart's Ghost!

162
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,886
- Russ Melbourne here.
- Hi. It's Angela.

163
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:18,926
I thought you'd be long gone.

164
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:21,071
No, I was getting ready to leave.
That's why I'm calling.

165
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:24,274
I'm glad you're still going,
but when you get back, we need to talk.

166
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:27,572
We're really desperately short
of your genius up here.

167
00:15:27,638 --> 00:15:29,908
Oh, please. I'm far
from being a genius, Russ...

168
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:32,789
especially with a room full of people
looking over my shoulder.

169
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:35,473
- That's not the reason I called.
- Just think about it, will ya?

170
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:38,293
The honchos up here aren't
gonna let me replace Dale...

171
00:15:38,358 --> 00:15:42,321
on such short notice, not with all the
security breaches we've had in the past.

172
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:45,425
Replace Dale. Okay.
What? You're kidding, right?

173
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:48,049
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd heard.

174
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,806
What? What happened?

175
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,568
Angela, Dale's dead. His plane
crashed last night outside L. A.

176
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,917
I just talked to him yesterday.
He was coming to see me.

177
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,447
Kind of puts things
in perspective, doesn't it?

178
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:06,062
Let's talk when you get back, huh?

179
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:09,484
And try to have a good vacation.

180
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:12,626
Okay. I'll talk to you soon, Russ.

181
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,738
Plenty of time. Ain't nothin' comin' in
or goin' out for the last hour.

182
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:43,796
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

183
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:45,720
We are sorry to announce...

184
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:48,948
there is a computer malfunction,
and all flights have been temporarily...

185
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:51,766
- The whole airport is down.
- When we get further information...

186
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,295
we will advise you.

187
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,256
Thank you very much.

188
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,677
- We will let you all know.
- Excuse me.

189
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:09,745
I understand.
We're doing the best we can.

190
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:16,239
A blood test taken last week...

191
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:19,030
at Bethesda Naval Hospital
did in fact reveal...

192
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:22,065
that Undersecretary of Defense
Mike Bergstrom...

193
00:17:22,138 --> 00:17:24,408
was infected with the AIDS virus.

194
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,929
You okay?

195
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:30,133
Yeah. It's all these people.

196
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:33,813
No, I meant are you okay with your soda?
Would you like a refill?

197
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,599
- No, I'm fine. I've had three.
- The malfunction has been repaired.

198
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,415
One more, and I'll be able
to fly myself to Mexico.

199
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:42,613
Looks like you won't have to.
Enjoy your flight.

200
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:30,619
- Mozart's Ghost!
- Waiter, I'd like a gibson, please.

201
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:34,513
It's a martini with an onion
instead of an olive.

202
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:38,003
Is that okay?
Thanks.

203
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:42,617
Excuse me.
Could I have one too, please?

204
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:44,822
I'll take mine up at the bar.

205
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:49,974
Didn't think anybody else
drank those anymore?

206
00:18:50,044 --> 00:18:54,517
I guess I'm not as unfashionable
as I once thought I was.

207
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:01,499
Is that business or pleasure?

208
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:03,801
Is there a difference?

209
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:06,357
Not a great deal
if you're a hacker.

210
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:13,495
That's a nice piece of hardware.
I assume you're in the business.

211
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,987
Isn't everybody?

212
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,816
Nope.

213
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:22,683
God, we're pathetic, aren't we?

214
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:27,645
Excuse me?

215
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,201
Well, we're here.

216
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:34,517
We're sitting on the most
perfect beach in the world...

217
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,307
and all we can think about
is where...

218
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:40,189
Where can I hook up my modem?

219
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:42,108
Yeah, exactly.

220
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,200
Um, I'm Jack Devlin.

221
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:56,436
- Angela Bennett.
- Angela?

222
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,542
My most embarrassing secret.

223
00:20:08,766 --> 00:20:10,654
You know Breakfast At Tiffany's?

224
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:13,621
- Very well. It's my favorite film.
- Right.

225
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:15,833
I wore out my membership renting it.

226
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:18,771
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Yes. Very much so.

227
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:20,537
When I was about 13...

228
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:26,009
I had this sort of
identity crisis.

229
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:29,817
I used to think
I was one of the characters.

230
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:31,927
You thought
you were Audrey Hepburn?

231
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:36,413
- No, I used to think I was the cat.
- The cat?

232
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,552
I'd sit there...

233
00:20:38,623 --> 00:20:42,038
and I'd play out
the last scene of the movie.

234
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,308
I'd just play it
over and over again.

235
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:49,979
- You know the last scene?
- Yes, I know the last scene.

236
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,348
Out in the pouring rain,
out in the alleyway.

237
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:54,935
I'm soaked to the bone,
and I'm scared.

238
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:58,528
And I'm...

239
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:02,715
abandoned.

240
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:04,672
I'm alone.

241
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,845
That's it.

242
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:17,207
Moon River

243
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,768
Wider than a mile

244
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:28,864
Would you have dinner
with me tonight?

245
00:21:31,553 --> 00:21:34,368
Come on.
It's your last night.

246
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:35,807
You know what?

247
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:40,128
I would... I would actually
really love to.

248
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:42,048
Great.

249
00:21:43,873 --> 00:21:47,735
- It's a company perk.
- God, this is a company perk?

250
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,697
- Yeah.
- Some perk.

251
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:52,543
I think I got a calendar
one year from Cathedral.

252
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,527
Where are you from?
Colorado?

253
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:12,569
Yes, it has to be.
The eastern...

254
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:16,254
Maybe it's the southeastern part
of the state.

255
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:19,355
The teeming metropolis
of La Junta, population 50.

256
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:22,622
- La Junta?
- That's pretty good.

257
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,690
Is my accent that strong
after all these years?

258
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,828
- No, it's just a trick I do.
- Oh.

259
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:33,437
Why "after all these years"?
How long have you been gone?

260
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:36,671
Oh, boy.
It seems like a lifetime.

261
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,910
Let's see. I was, uh...

262
00:22:38,978 --> 00:22:41,696
I was 15 going on 10...

263
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:46,367
and we moved from La Junta
to San Jose...

264
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:48,290
Tulsa, um...

265
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:50,209
So your father
got transferred a lot?

266
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:53,887
No, not really. No. He, um...

267
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:58,527
I don't know. He just, you know...
He just transferred out one day.

268
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,482
What? What are you looking at?

269
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:09,665
You.

270
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:12,543
Me?

271
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,681
Computers are your life,
aren't they?

272
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:22,141
Yes. Perfect hiding place.

273
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:25,698
Thanks.

274
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:30,107
- Well, yeah, okay.
- Nice one of you.

275
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:34,779
I have one or two other interests,
I'll have you know.

276
00:23:34,852 --> 00:23:38,650
Such as? What's your speciality
in computers?

277
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,765
Oh, anything, pretty much.

278
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,324
Beta testing, mostly,
but pretty much anything.

279
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:47,226
- That's way over my head, I'm afraid.
- No, no.

280
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,807
You just go into people's systems,
you find the faults and you fix it.

281
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:54,430
What happens if they don't
have any faults?

282
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:57,151
Don't believe I've met one yet.

283
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:02,339
You must be a bit cold.

284
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:05,154
Not really.
Well, yeah, a little bit.

285
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:11,965
- Here.
- What?

286
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:13,980
It goes around here.

287
00:24:19,462 --> 00:24:20,836
Better?

288
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:37,407
- Want one?
- Oh, God, I used to smoke those.

289
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:39,582
But you quit, right?

290
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,069
Well, I refuse to.

291
00:24:45,574 --> 00:24:48,957
I reckon you gotta try a few things
in life without a safety net...

292
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,202
or how else you gonna know
you're alive?

293
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,823
Well, I take my share of risks.

294
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:56,709
I don't always floss.

295
00:24:56,774 --> 00:24:59,840
I rip the tags off my pillows
when they're new.

296
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:04,643
- My kind of woman.
- Yeah, well...

297
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:08,389
Pretty adventurous?

298
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:12,033
I don't know.
What did you have in mind?

299
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:14,078
Dare you risk it?

300
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:17,725
Shit! My purse!

301
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,654
- Fuck!
- No! Don't!

302
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,693
- It's not worth getting killed over!
- Come back!

303
00:25:21,768 --> 00:25:23,742
- Jack, come back here!
- You! Stop!

304
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,413
- It's not here.
- It's not in hotel.

305
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,047
I look everywhere.

306
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,836
So I come here. I do like you say.
Whoosh, like magician.

307
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:40,002
Oh, yeah.
You're the midget Houdini.

308
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,761
Okay. Now the dinero.

309
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:29,444
God, I had everything in that bag.
I had my passport, my credit cards.

310
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:31,586
- Ow.
- Sorry.

311
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,599
Thanks for doing this.

312
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:36,160
Well, you're the one
bleeding to death.

313
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:40,127
I am the one crying
about my MasterCard.

314
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,721
I apologize
for having been a jerk.

315
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:46,437
What do you mean?
I'm the jerk.

316
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,736
Only trying to impress you.

317
00:26:51,338 --> 00:26:53,574
Well, for future reference...

318
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:57,220
you should know that the living tend
to interest me more than the dead do.

319
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,679
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

320
00:26:59,754 --> 00:27:02,022
I suppose that's quite healthy.

321
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:13,733
I suppose we ought to call up
the Cancun police on the ship-to-shore.

322
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,509
It's not working.
We'll have to head further out.

323
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:26,313
You can head to Morocco for all I care.
It's beautiful out here.

324
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,304
How we doing?

325
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:46,470
Still no dice.

326
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:11,786
I'm just going down below.
I won't be a minute.

327
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:40,199
Maybe we didn't go out far enough.

328
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:42,374
No, this should do it.

329
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:51,946
Tonight's been
so out of control, huh?

330
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:53,387
Yeah.

331
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,306
I hope you don't
take this the wrong way...

332
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:25,959
but this isn't exactly my style.

333
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,896
I thought you liked taking risks.

334
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:35,275
Well, yes, but I mean...

335
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:38,157
- You know what I mean.
- What?

336
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:40,327
- You know, first date.
- Yeah.

337
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,569
- Sex, one-night stand.
- Oh, sex.

338
00:29:42,638 --> 00:29:44,875
Yes, that sort of thing.

339
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:47,659
You've always been
a relationship kind of girl.

340
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:50,028
Absolutely.
Both times.

341
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,655
So when was the last time?

342
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,543
Um, 1933.

343
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:00,037
Oh, I see.

344
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:04,999
And who was he?
Your college boyfriend?

345
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,631
Yeah, I bet he was the...

346
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:13,551
He was the captain
of the drinking team.

347
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:17,093
Wasn't ready for a relationship.

348
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:20,102
Oh, I wish I had been that lucky.

349
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:23,023
No, it was my shrink, actually.

350
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:26,765
You know the story.

351
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:30,923
I thought I was lonely,
and he forgot he was married.

352
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:35,174
That's okay.
It didn't last very long.

353
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:40,453
My mom developed Alzheimer's
around then, so it was really...

354
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:45,711
You know what?
I'm gonna shut up right now.

355
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:49,256
- I'm just gonna be quiet.
- It's okay.

356
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:53,157
No, actually, it's me
who doesn't want to hear it.

357
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:59,755
Sorry. I'm rambling a little bit
because I'm a little nervous.

358
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:06,026
You want a drink?

359
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,912
Yes. That'd be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.

360
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:55,728
So, what's this for?

361
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,774
It's, uh...
It's for shark fishing.

362
00:32:01,842 --> 00:32:05,487
Shark fishing?
With a silencer?

363
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:07,660
Yeah.

364
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,753
You certainly
seem to know your ordnance.

365
00:32:12,818 --> 00:32:15,306
Colorado.
You grow up with guns.

366
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,345
Yeah.

367
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:22,863
So, who are you, Jack?

368
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,446
Who am I?

369
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:28,816
I'll tell you who I am.

370
00:32:28,882 --> 00:32:31,784
I'm Captain Goddamn America
meets Albert Schweitzer.

371
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:34,543
That's who I am.
Isn't that what you always wanted?

372
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:36,203
It is. I remember.

373
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:38,643
It was butch...

374
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,952
beautiful...

375
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:41,546
brilliant,
spends all day...

376
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:42,764
dashing into the fray...

377
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,202
fists flying.

378
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:48,715
Sorry, I don't know
any organ cantatas.

379
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:50,031
Was that it?

380
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:54,344
And if you'll excuse me...

381
00:32:55,252 --> 00:32:57,641
it's time to make the world
safe for democracy.

382
00:33:08,212 --> 00:33:09,969
Where's the clip?

383
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,327
Give me that!

384
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:18,002
Bitch.

385
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,424
Somebody, I need help.

386
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:26,953
Somebody? Hello?

387
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:28,851
Please, somebody,
I need help.

388
00:33:32,821 --> 00:33:34,282
Keys. Okay.

389
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,630
What? No.
How did I get here?

390
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:23,598
How'd I get here?

391
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:26,192
A fisherman found you.
He brought you here.

392
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:29,047
You were very lucky
they came by.

393
00:35:29,112 --> 00:35:30,968
How long have I been here?

394
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:33,007
Three days.
Try not to talk too much.

395
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,119
Oh, we found a man's wallet...

396
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:38,486
filled with pesos
and a lot of U. S. dollars.

397
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:41,171
- We tried to contact him...
- No. He...

398
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,208
No. There was no luck
finding this man.

399
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,149
There was a disk.

400
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:50,291
Green square, plastic disk.

401
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:51,768
Ah, yes.

402
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:55,696
The disk was ruined by the sun.

403
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:58,354
You relax now, hmm?
Get well.

404
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:00,018
- No. I need...
- In a few days.

405
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:04,562
Look at you now.
You haven't got the strength. Please.

406
00:36:04,633 --> 00:36:06,804
My clothes.
How much do I owe you?

407
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,655
Please. You have to relax now.
You have to rest.

408
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:11,924
- You need a few days.
- I need my clothes.

409
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:14,001
I have to go.
I just need my clothes.

410
00:36:23,418 --> 00:36:27,444
In national news, we go
to WNN correspondent Daniel Schorr.

411
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:30,362
- Hi. I need...
- Wall Street panicked when prices...

412
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:33,774
appeared to tumble at a rate
reminiscent of the Black Tuesday crash.

413
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,271
Officials suspended trading
when it became clear...

414
00:36:36,345 --> 00:36:39,924
that the losses were fictitious
and caused by computer pranksters.

415
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:43,572
- I need my room key for 2806, please.
- What is the name?

416
00:36:43,642 --> 00:36:46,064
-Angela Bennett.
-Wall Street expects to open tomorrow...

417
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:50,872
with its computers protected by Gregg
Microsystems' latest security program...

418
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:53,524
aptly nicknamed the Gatekeeper.

419
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:55,449
What about that prank downtown?

420
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:59,094
Pranks? Short-sheeting
someone's bed is a prank.

421
00:36:59,162 --> 00:37:02,392
These Praetorians could've done
serious damage to our economy...

422
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:04,563
just as the actions
recently at LAX.

423
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:08,082
No, I'm sorry. Angela Bennett
checked out last Saturday night.

424
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:10,969
No. Sorry, you don't understand.
I'm Angela Bennett.

425
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:12,976
I'm standing right here.
I didn't check out.

426
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:16,084
It's not on the computer here.
Let me check one more thing.

427
00:37:19,547 --> 00:37:21,401
No Angela Bennett.
She checked out last Saturday night.

428
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:25,718
No, I didn't check out.
I would know if I checked out.

429
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:28,504
- I didn't check out.
- According to the computer, you did.

430
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:31,059
There's nothing I can do for you.
Okay? I'm sorry.

431
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:33,980
- Excuse me, sir?
- Step here, sir, please.

432
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,661
That room is fine.
We'll take it.

433
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:40,594
That's for you. Okay.
This one. Excuse me, ma'am.

434
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:45,847
- There you go.
- Thank you.

435
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:48,785
Please dial
your card number again now.

436
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:51,795
The card number you have just dialed
is not valid.

437
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,091
Miss Marx?

438
00:37:56,412 --> 00:37:58,801
Please dial
your card number again now.

439
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:01,179
- Ruth Marx? Excuse me.
- The card number you have just dialed...

440
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,633
- Are you Ruth Marx?
- No.

441
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,834
You're not the woman who was here
about a temporary visa?

442
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,755
No, I am here about a visa, but...

443
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:14,676
Is your Social Security number
915-30-1717?

444
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:18,971
You live at 407 Finley Avenue,
Venice, California?

445
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:20,787
Yeah.

446
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,715
Well, then according
to the computers...

447
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,919
of the California Department
of Motor Vehicles...

448
00:38:24,988 --> 00:38:27,028
you're Ruth Marx.

449
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:30,073
So if that's who you are...

450
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,989
you need to sign your name there,
and we'll issue your visa.

451
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:36,468
- But I'm not...
- You're not what?

452
00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:42,776
I'm not clear about something.

453
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:47,286
Without this, I can't get back
into the United States. Is that correct?

454
00:38:47,357 --> 00:38:48,666
That's correct.

455
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:53,174
So all I would have to do
is just sign Ruth Marx and...

456
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:54,653
Right there.

457
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:52,375
Okay. Think, think.

458
00:40:26,144 --> 00:40:27,606
Oh, my God.

459
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:30,973
Oh, my God.

460
00:40:34,176 --> 00:40:37,046
Where're you runnin'?
Don't run. Take your time. Relax.

461
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:40,503
My name is Stan Whiteman,
Whiteman Realty. Let me show you around.

462
00:40:40,577 --> 00:40:41,951
You'll like it.

463
00:40:42,017 --> 00:40:44,406
Oh, I definitely saw her move out.

464
00:40:44,481 --> 00:40:46,391
Okay, when was this?

465
00:40:46,465 --> 00:40:49,334
Three days ago. Moving van,
moving men, furniture.

466
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:53,599
I've been in Mexico for over a week.
How could I be in L. A. selling my house?

467
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:57,276
It wasn't your house to sell!
It's not her! It's not Angela Bennett!

468
00:40:57,345 --> 00:40:59,679
- Calm down.
- I am Angela Bennett!

469
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:02,330
The real Angela Bennett
had the deed and the mortgage papers!

470
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:05,881
I got 20,000 in computers.
I checked every record. It's not her!

471
00:41:05,952 --> 00:41:10,656
Ma'am, it would help if you could
produce some form of identification.

472
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:12,576
You know what?
I agree with you.

473
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:14,813
But as I have told you
1,000 times today...

474
00:41:14,882 --> 00:41:16,736
I had everything stolen in Cozumel.

475
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:19,900
Please. Ask her how she got
across the border without a passport.

476
00:41:19,971 --> 00:41:22,206
- I had a temporary issued.
- Do they do that?

477
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:26,846
- I don't think they do that.
- Oh, my God. This is ridiculous.

478
00:41:26,914 --> 00:41:29,150
Here. Here it is.
This is it.

479
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:31,706
It's just that
it's under a different name.

480
00:41:31,778 --> 00:41:34,811
- Why's that?
- Because they think I'm not me.

481
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:37,021
- Is this your signature?
- Well, no.

482
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,985
It's my handwriting, but I just signed
a different name that they gave me.

483
00:41:41,058 --> 00:41:42,946
It's a federal offense
to forge a visa.

484
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:45,946
Oh, really? It is?
And what is it to steal an entire house?

485
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:49,335
- Yo, Mike. You wanna run this?
- I'll be right back.

486
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,418
It's not gonna make any difference,
because what they've done is...

487
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:54,109
they've screwed with my information
and my fingerprints.

488
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:57,213
- Who's they?
- I have no idea.

489
00:41:57,282 --> 00:42:00,381
Where do you work?
Do you work around here?

490
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:03,931
Yeah, I work in my house,
but my office is in San Francisco.

491
00:42:04,002 --> 00:42:07,002
But I've never been there.
I work out of my house.

492
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:10,654
You don't know one person in a town
you've lived in for four years...

493
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:13,625
who can vouch you're Angela Bennett...
not a mother, a father?

494
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,896
My mother is not well.
My father is...

495
00:42:16,963 --> 00:42:19,200
No.

496
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:23,937
There's, uh...
There's my therapist Alan Champion.

497
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:26,687
- Your therapist?
- My ex-therapist, all right?

498
00:42:38,563 --> 00:42:41,410
Yeah, we've got a Ruth Marx
trying to run a scam at a house.

499
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:44,543
She's wanted for prostitution
and narcotics.

500
00:42:44,613 --> 00:42:47,330
We're gonna bring her in.

501
00:42:47,396 --> 00:42:49,982
Um, would you excuse me?

502
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:53,762
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm just gonna use...

503
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,427
Mrs. Raines...

504
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:02,564
is she or isn't she?

505
00:43:02,629 --> 00:43:04,930
She kept to herself,
didn't talk to anybody.

506
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:08,100
- Where's the girl?
- She's...

507
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,400
Where's my phone?
Anybody seen my phone?

508
00:43:26,629 --> 00:43:29,498
Excuse me, sir. Did you see
a young woman running out of here?

509
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:32,476
- No, sir. I haven't seen anyone.
- Thanks.

510
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,535
- Yeah?
- What the hell happened, Devlin?

511
00:43:57,607 --> 00:44:01,534
Don't worry. We'll get hold of the disk.
We'll find who she's been speaking to.

512
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:04,672
She's out here on her own.
She's feeling pretty vulnerable.

513
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:08,387
We don't want another Cozumel, Devlin.
She's your responsibility. Deal with it.

514
00:44:08,454 --> 00:44:11,105
I said I'd take care of her,
all right?

515
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:22,407
- Cathedral Software.
- Russ Melbourne.

516
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,335
- Cathedral Software.
- Russ Melbourne.

517
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:26,116
Mr. Melbourne is no longer
with the company.

518
00:44:26,183 --> 00:44:27,677
What do you mean?

519
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:30,653
May I connect you
to someone who could help you?

520
00:44:30,727 --> 00:44:32,702
I've never dealt with anybody
in operations.

521
00:44:32,775 --> 00:44:36,190
- I don't know anybody else.
- Who may I connect you with?

522
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:39,165
Head of Security Systems.
Tell them that it's Angela Bennett.

523
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:41,378
Thank you. I'll put you through
to Miss Bennett.

524
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:44,578
What? No.
I am Angela Bennett.

525
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:48,773
This is Angela Bennett.

526
00:44:55,335 --> 00:44:58,500
- Who is this?
- This is Angela Bennett. Hello?

527
00:45:03,561 --> 00:45:06,975
This is someone that can help you.
Give us the disk, Angela.

528
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:10,693
You have the wrong person.
I don't know what you're talking about.

529
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,575
Just give us the disk,
and we'll give you your life back.

530
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:17,917
I don't understand. I don't have
your disk. I don't know what you mean.

531
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:20,327
Give us the disk, Angela.

532
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,438
- What's the number?
- 555-7605.

533
00:45:34,504 --> 00:45:37,538
- Did you get the address?
- It's 3100 California.

534
00:45:46,281 --> 00:45:48,484
Hi. This is Dr. Alan Champion.
I can't come to the phone right now.

535
00:45:48,553 --> 00:45:51,204
- Please be home.
- Please leave your name, your number.

536
00:45:51,272 --> 00:45:53,129
You know the drill.

537
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,319
Are you screening?
Please be screening.

538
00:45:57,385 --> 00:46:00,451
- Hello? Hello. I'm home.
- Hi. It's me.

539
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,898
I need your help.
I'm in a lot of trouble.

540
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,409
- Shit.
- I'm not sure what you want me to do.

541
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:12,516
Hold on.
This is a cell phone, right?

542
00:46:12,585 --> 00:46:15,006
Yeah, so we can't put
a normal trace on it.

543
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:17,700
Listen. There's no problem. No.

544
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,625
- Just get the number.
- Right.

545
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,111
But don't dial it.
Just send out a signal.

546
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:24,040
- Send it from the base?
- Yeah.

547
00:46:24,105 --> 00:46:27,237
Then find me two repeater cells
that can pick it up.

548
00:46:27,307 --> 00:46:30,689
Give me the bisect, and it'll find it
within a few hundred yards.

549
00:46:30,763 --> 00:46:32,618
- Okay.
- Go.

550
00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:03,267
- Go, go.
- Nice to see you too.

551
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:05,707
- I'm sorry. Just go.
- Come on. I'm not a cab.

552
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:08,106
- Say hi.
- Hi. Can we go now?

553
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:10,408
Yeah, now we can go.

554
00:47:10,475 --> 00:47:13,575
Listen, do you still have
that laptop that I gave you?

555
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:15,782
- Uh-huh. I'm wearing it.
- I'm serious. Do you have it?

556
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:19,593
- Yes, I have it.
- We need to get it and go to a hotel.

557
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:22,081
- Now that's doable.
- Alan, just go.

558
00:47:22,156 --> 00:47:25,189
Just go, go, go.

559
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,555
I swear to God. I asked for a quarter,
and she gave me a telephone.

560
00:47:28,621 --> 00:47:31,174
Yeah, that's right.
I'm calling everybody.

561
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:32,772
Clever girl.

562
00:47:34,604 --> 00:47:36,676
Voila. Ouch.

563
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:43,018
Alan, you don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

564
00:47:43,084 --> 00:47:45,735
I'm sure that...
God, what's her name?

565
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:48,969
Amy. Don't worry.
It's over with Amy.

566
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:55,049
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be, dearie.

567
00:47:55,116 --> 00:47:57,537
We're not.
This is bizarre.

568
00:47:57,612 --> 00:48:00,167
I haven't seen you in so long.
What are we even doing here?

569
00:48:00,238 --> 00:48:02,376
I just figured you would be safe.

570
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:06,275
Oh, great. So I've gone from being
a self-centered asshole to safe.

571
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,902
Thank you very much.

572
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:12,999
No, I just figured that they couldn't
trace me to you and that your...

573
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:16,004
Your patient records
are confidential, right?

574
00:48:16,077 --> 00:48:19,558
My patient records.
Yeah, I knew I had my subtle charms.

575
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:22,597
It's just you're the only person
I have to turn to right now.

576
00:48:22,669 --> 00:48:27,525
And you know what, Angie?
I'm gonna take that as a big compliment.

577
00:48:27,597 --> 00:48:30,532
Guess what time it is.
Gibsons.

578
00:48:30,605 --> 00:48:33,324
Almost. We have no onions,
so we'll have to use these.

579
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,773
Seldane, the antihistamine
of champions.

580
00:48:37,774 --> 00:48:39,749
I could always make you laugh,
couldn't I?

581
00:48:39,822 --> 00:48:41,678
You know what?
I'm gonna pass.

582
00:48:41,743 --> 00:48:43,149
- No drink?
- No drink.

583
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:46,797
All right.
I come bearing gifts.

584
00:48:46,862 --> 00:48:49,415
Some of Amy's clothes for you here.
Try these on.

585
00:48:57,646 --> 00:49:00,461
This is such a nightmare.
It's like I'm not even me anymore.

586
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:02,436
Hey, come here.

587
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:05,478
Come on. Look at me.
You're freaking me.

588
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,656
You gotta take a breath,
take a pause.

589
00:49:08,687 --> 00:49:12,462
Okay, if you're not you,
tell me who you think you are.

590
00:49:12,527 --> 00:49:14,730
- Christ, you're not even listening.
- I am listening.

591
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:16,970
But come on.
Somebody stole your purse.

592
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:19,941
- I didn't expect you to believe me.
- I do believe you.

593
00:49:20,015 --> 00:49:22,568
That's not true.
You know what I believe?

594
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:24,941
I believe you're
a very frightened woman.

595
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:26,862
In general, you're disconnected
from the human race.

596
00:49:26,926 --> 00:49:29,163
I think you're way out there
on your own.

597
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:31,500
- You mix in your father leaving...
- Oh, no.

598
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:35,047
My father has nothing to do
with the fact that my car's missing.

599
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,738
It has nothing to do with the fact
that my house is empty.

600
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,077
It has nothing to do with the fact
that the police department...

601
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,512
is chasing after me and that
somebody out there wants to kill me.

602
00:49:42,577 --> 00:49:45,708
I believe something happened,
but that just doesn't make sense.

603
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:48,427
I don't want to be simplistic...

604
00:49:48,496 --> 00:49:51,463
but I think you're reaching out.

605
00:49:51,536 --> 00:49:53,924
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

606
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,007
I'm reaching out
to anybody who knows me...

607
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,381
anybody who will listen to me
and believe me...

608
00:49:58,447 --> 00:50:00,782
be my friend
and somebody to trust.

609
00:50:00,848 --> 00:50:02,987
Hey, Angie, I'm sorry.

610
00:50:03,055 --> 00:50:07,049
Sometimes it's easier for me
to play doctor than it is to listen.

611
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,212
I just don't understand. Why me?
I am nobody. I am nothing.

612
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:13,321
But they knew everything about me.

613
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:16,524
They knew what I ate, what I drank,
what movies I watched.

614
00:50:16,592 --> 00:50:20,270
They knew where I was from. They knew
what cigarettes I used to smoke.

615
00:50:20,337 --> 00:50:23,719
And everything they did,
they must have watched on the Internet.

616
00:50:23,793 --> 00:50:25,833
I don't know.
Watched my credit cards?

617
00:50:25,905 --> 00:50:28,905
Our whole lives are on the computer,
and they knew that I could be vanished.

618
00:50:28,977 --> 00:50:32,108
They knew that nobody would care
and it wouldn't matter.

619
00:50:32,177 --> 00:50:35,689
It's going to be okay.
What can I do?

620
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:38,444
I need for you to take my mom
and just put her anywhere.

621
00:50:38,513 --> 00:50:40,423
I don't care where.
Just put her under a different name.

622
00:50:40,497 --> 00:50:44,043
I don't know what these people will do.
You can do that 'cause you're a doctor?

623
00:50:44,115 --> 00:50:47,081
I can put your mom
in a sanitarium for observation.

624
00:50:47,153 --> 00:50:49,008
How's that?

625
00:50:49,073 --> 00:50:53,067
That would mean a lot to me,
'cause she's all I got left right now.

626
00:50:53,138 --> 00:50:54,992
All that you have left?

627
00:50:55,058 --> 00:50:58,670
Christ, Angie, they've really
gotten into your head with this.

628
00:50:58,738 --> 00:51:02,861
Put yourself in my shoes.
I don't hear from you for a long time.

629
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:05,744
I get a phone call,
this convoluted story. Come on.

630
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:09,609
I'm not buying the whole package,
but I'll tell you what I can do.

631
00:51:09,682 --> 00:51:12,072
I have a friend in the federal building.
His name's Ben Phillips.

632
00:51:12,147 --> 00:51:14,285
He's an FBl agent.
Why don't I...

633
00:51:14,354 --> 00:51:17,737
I've been running from the police
ever since I got back in this country.

634
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:20,626
- That's the last thing that I need.
- Well, that's great, Angela.

635
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:24,139
Why don't you just live the rest
of your life in this hotel room?

636
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,404
Well, do you trust him?

637
00:51:27,474 --> 00:51:30,376
Yeah. I used to hold his head
over the toilet at frat parties.

638
00:51:30,451 --> 00:51:32,458
Come on. I'm serious.
Do you trust him?

639
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,603
Yeah, I trust Ben. I do.

640
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,702
Let's formulate our plan.
I'm gonna go back to my place.

641
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,032
I'll figure out the best way
to transfer your mom to the sanitarium.

642
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,946
Then I'll calI Ben. If I get any
information, I'll get back to you.

643
00:51:46,675 --> 00:51:49,741
Don't be so down. Come here.
It's gonna be okay.

644
00:51:49,812 --> 00:51:51,666
I'm on watch now.

645
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:55,375
You know, this would've never happened
if you had stayed with me.

646
00:51:57,843 --> 00:52:00,363
Hey, Alan, thank you...

647
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:02,442
for everything.

648
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:06,256
You're welcome.
You stay put, kiddo.

649
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:04,715
Merci. Now prompt me, please.

650
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,751
Okay, you carried this around, Devlin,
because it was important.

651
00:53:18,134 --> 00:53:20,141
Bethesda Naval Hospital.

652
00:53:20,214 --> 00:53:21,904
Password.

653
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:26,548
Okay, password.
We're gonna try you.

654
00:53:30,135 --> 00:53:31,661
No. Okay.

655
00:53:31,734 --> 00:53:34,800
Well, you look familiar.
Let's try you again.

656
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:38,543
Come on. Okay.

657
00:53:49,366 --> 00:53:51,439
Bergstrom? What?

658
00:53:57,271 --> 00:53:58,831
Oh, my God.

659
00:54:14,326 --> 00:54:15,440
Yeah.

660
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:18,610
- Someone's on.
- Think it's our girl?

661
00:54:18,678 --> 00:54:21,744
Whoever it is is covering their tracks.
A dozen hops so far.

662
00:54:21,816 --> 00:54:24,467
A pop in Switzerland, a Unix box
in the University of Montana...

663
00:54:24,535 --> 00:54:26,957
five different routers
at Berkeley.

664
00:54:27,032 --> 00:54:29,967
- They know what they're doing.
- How long will it take to track her?

665
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:34,676
Depending how long she stays on,
15 minutes, half hour at most.

666
00:54:34,743 --> 00:54:36,718
Call me the second you find her.

667
00:54:36,793 --> 00:54:38,833
And that other matter?

668
00:54:39,928 --> 00:54:42,067
That's free of charge.

669
00:54:58,489 --> 00:54:59,698
Thanks.

670
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,217
Praetorians?

671
00:56:13,178 --> 00:56:15,731
What? I need more information.

672
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:19,249
"The Big Bad Wolf, Cyberterrorists..."

673
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,786
I need more information.

674
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:29,970
"LAX, Wall Street, Atlanta.
Dangerous. Don't mess with them."

675
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:32,531
They've already
started messing with me.

676
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:37,713
"Meet in IRL. In Private.

677
00:56:38,459 --> 00:56:40,915
In real life."

678
00:56:40,987 --> 00:56:43,289
No, no.
It's gotta be a public place.

679
00:56:44,636 --> 00:56:48,858
Where it's safe
with a lot of people.

680
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:54,616
The Santa Monica Pier by...

681
00:56:54,684 --> 00:56:56,145
Where?

682
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:57,943
The Ferris wheel.

683
00:57:10,044 --> 00:57:13,623
- Any luck?
- 8833 Rosewood in West Hollywood.

684
00:57:13,692 --> 00:57:16,626
Remind me to buy you guys
something nice.

685
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,492
Hello?

686
00:58:14,429 --> 00:58:15,837
Angie!

687
00:58:17,182 --> 00:58:19,735
Come on, let me in.
I'm dying out here with this food.

688
00:58:19,807 --> 00:58:21,464
Sorry.

689
00:58:23,006 --> 00:58:25,211
- I thought, you know.
- Forget it.

690
00:58:26,751 --> 00:58:30,133
I figured you'd be hungry
so I stopped on the way over.

691
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:33,108
I got your favorite.
Chinese.

692
00:58:33,182 --> 00:58:36,860
It's your favorite.
I never cared for it, remember?

693
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,065
That's immaterial. I knew
it was somebody's favorite.

694
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:41,142
- How's my mom?
- Mom is fine.

695
00:58:41,215 --> 00:58:44,476
She's safely ensconced at the
county sanitarium. Everything's good.

696
00:58:44,543 --> 00:58:46,397
- Great. Thank you.
- Listen.

697
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:49,496
About the Chinese.
Let me make it up to you.

698
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:52,120
Let's go to that Greek restaurant.

699
00:58:52,191 --> 00:58:54,329
- I can't. I gotta go.
- Really?

700
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:57,148
Every time I see you now
you're running away.

701
00:58:57,215 --> 00:59:00,183
I'm not. There's a guy
from the Internet...

702
00:59:00,254 --> 00:59:02,393
who might know something
about what's going on.

703
00:59:02,463 --> 00:59:06,293
Can I tell you about Ben Phillips,
the guy you wanted me to talk to?

704
00:59:06,366 --> 00:59:11,157
I told him your story. He wants
to see you first thing in the morning.

705
00:59:11,232 --> 00:59:12,639
Can't you wait...

706
00:59:12,704 --> 00:59:15,770
Does he know about LAX and Wall Street,
and what happened in Atlanta?

707
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:21,470
Of course. Kids black out part of
a power grid and spell "Braves Suck."

708
00:59:21,536 --> 00:59:23,390
Is that a national emergency?

709
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:25,911
Cyberbob's figured it out,
and he knows what he's doing.

710
00:59:25,983 --> 00:59:29,083
- If we don't talk, it'll be too late.
- Listen to you! Cyberbob!

711
00:59:29,152 --> 00:59:34,073
You're meeting a guy named Cyberbob!
Have you ever even seen him?

712
00:59:34,145 --> 00:59:36,511
- I don't want you going alone.
- Come with me.

713
00:59:36,576 --> 00:59:40,320
- Sure. Where are we to meet him?
- Santa Monica Pier.

714
00:59:55,553 --> 00:59:59,033
- Yeah?
- Hi. Bob Fox?

715
00:59:59,105 --> 01:00:02,520
These people are dangerous. They killed
Dale because of what he knew.

716
01:00:02,593 --> 01:00:05,725
- They think I have this program.
- I'm with you.

717
01:00:05,793 --> 01:00:08,345
But first, somebody tries to kill you,
now this guy Dale...

718
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:11,732
They put somebody in my place
at Cathedral to get rid of any traces.

719
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:15,104
Why would anybody want to do this?

720
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:18,847
They would want somebody
in Cathedral's mainframe to set traps...

721
01:00:18,914 --> 01:00:22,394
to make sure
this doesn't happen again.

722
01:00:22,465 --> 01:00:25,084
That would take weeks!
You cannot do that from the outside.

723
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:28,383
Remember that Internet number
that Devlin guy had?

724
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:32,126
I plugged it in, and I'm staring
at the personaI medical files...

725
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:34,397
of the Undersecretary of Defense
Michael Bergstrom.

726
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:36,637
- The guy who blew his head off.
- Yeah.

727
01:00:36,706 --> 01:00:39,968
They said a computer blood test
told him he had AIDS, right?

728
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:42,783
When they did the autopsy,
there was no HIV found.

729
01:00:44,866 --> 01:00:47,900
Maybe when they do my autopsy,
I can finally prove I'm not Ruth Marx.

730
01:00:47,971 --> 01:00:51,200
What's frightening me is I'm starting
to think you're not delusional.

731
01:00:51,266 --> 01:00:53,273
I need to get back to Cathedral...

732
01:00:53,347 --> 01:00:55,713
get on that Mozart's Ghost program,
'cause that's gotta be it.

733
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:59,127
They've got this echo system
on their computers...

734
01:00:59,203 --> 01:01:03,097
where you can retrace your keystrokes
in case you made a mistake.

735
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:05,560
Are you all right?
Alan, what's the matter?

736
01:01:05,635 --> 01:01:07,871
Pull over.

737
01:01:07,938 --> 01:01:09,881
You're scaring me. Come on!

738
01:01:09,955 --> 01:01:11,383
Talk to me.

739
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,306
-Pills.
-What pills? What are you talking about?

740
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,314
Get over here.
We'll go to the hospital.

741
01:01:17,923 --> 01:01:19,833
Be okay, isn't he?

742
01:01:20,868 --> 01:01:23,039
He's allergic to penicillin.

743
01:01:23,108 --> 01:01:26,456
They have him intubated and pumped
full of epinephrine.

744
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:29,565
- I have no idea what you said.
- He's going to be fine.

745
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:32,188
If you like, you can go see him now.

746
01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:34,976
I would like that. Thank you.

747
01:01:47,748 --> 01:01:49,691
How do you feel?

748
01:01:51,268 --> 01:01:54,083
- I'm starving.
- Yeah?

749
01:01:56,485 --> 01:01:59,038
Well, the minute you get out...

750
01:01:59,109 --> 01:02:02,622
I'll cook you the best microwave meal
you've ever had.

751
01:02:03,748 --> 01:02:05,658
How long they gonna keep me here?

752
01:02:05,733 --> 01:02:09,213
I think just another day.

753
01:02:09,284 --> 01:02:13,310
And will you be handling
the outpatient care, nurse?

754
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,552
Do you mind?

755
01:02:17,349 --> 01:02:22,238
Visions of sponge baths
dance in my head.

756
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:34,173
I gotta go.

757
01:02:35,653 --> 01:02:37,180
You gonna be okay?

758
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:42,239
I'll be fine.
I'm more worried about you.

759
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:45,406
I'll be fine.

760
01:02:46,885 --> 01:02:49,274
Wish it was over,
but I'll be fine.

761
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,976
I know.

762
01:02:53,638 --> 01:02:56,737
Come here.
I wanna tell you something.

763
01:02:57,766 --> 01:02:59,457
Come closer.

764
01:03:11,142 --> 01:03:14,011
I've wanted to do that
since yesterday.

765
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,302
Yeah, well...

766
01:03:18,374 --> 01:03:21,669
when you get better,
I might let you do it again.

767
01:03:25,127 --> 01:03:28,956
- Do you still think I'm crazy?
- Sure, I do.

768
01:03:30,183 --> 01:03:31,557
Always have.

769
01:03:57,608 --> 01:04:01,885
Get your cotton candy, fifty cents.

770
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,815
Great picture!

771
01:04:03,879 --> 01:04:05,253
Bye.

772
01:04:06,632 --> 01:04:08,803
How you doin'?
Howdy.

773
01:04:08,873 --> 01:04:12,800
Everybody's a winner!
Step right up.

774
01:04:12,871 --> 01:04:17,028
Honey, wanna dance?
Give Benny a big hug.

775
01:04:17,096 --> 01:04:18,951
Come back here.

776
01:05:40,138 --> 01:05:45,506
It's safer to stay right here.
Sorry, Bob couldn't make it.

777
01:05:46,762 --> 01:05:51,497
Hey! I hope this isn't how you greet
all your old lovers.

778
01:05:51,562 --> 01:05:53,799
That's not exactly the category
you fit into.

779
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:56,233
I'm surprised you didn't kill me,
then fuck me.

780
01:05:57,611 --> 01:05:59,782
It was difficult, right?

781
01:05:59,851 --> 01:06:03,331
I was genuinely attracted to you.
I still am.

782
01:06:03,404 --> 01:06:06,054
I'm gonna genuinely attract
the Santa Monica Police...

783
01:06:06,123 --> 01:06:08,295
if you don't let go of me now.

784
01:06:09,516 --> 01:06:12,166
You've been avoiding them
since you ran out of that house.

785
01:06:13,707 --> 01:06:16,074
They'd still be very interested
in hearing...

786
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:19,969
how you crashed Dale Hessman's plane,
how you tried to kill me.

787
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:23,012
- They'd love to hear about that.
- Go ahead. Feel tree.

788
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,970
They'd be happy
to make your acquaintance.

789
01:06:25,036 --> 01:06:29,542
Do you know that Ruth Marx
has a criminal record?

790
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:31,717
For drugs...

791
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,446
prostitution.

792
01:06:33,516 --> 01:06:39,049
- You've got quite a record.
- Almost as good as Bergstrom has.

793
01:06:39,116 --> 01:06:43,459
I know about Bergstrom's suicide
and I know alI about the Praetorians.

794
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,834
I'm sure they'd love
to hear about that.

795
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,253
Everybody has their button...

796
01:06:50,509 --> 01:06:53,673
and Bergstrom's just happened
to be homophobia.

797
01:06:55,341 --> 01:06:58,723
You have to know people well enough
to know...

798
01:06:58,797 --> 01:07:00,520
which button to push.

799
01:07:02,187 --> 01:07:06,084
I don't have your disk.
If I had it, I would give it to you.

800
01:07:06,157 --> 01:07:08,524
- It was ruined in Mexico.
- It's okay.

801
01:07:10,158 --> 01:07:14,118
But all we need now is what's up here,
so you come with me.

802
01:07:15,597 --> 01:07:18,444
I promise you I'll look after you.
Come on.

803
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:24,997
I don't understand.
What do you want?

804
01:07:25,069 --> 01:07:30,339
It's not about what I want.
It's about what my employers want.

805
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,453
Take a look around you.

806
01:07:32,525 --> 01:07:35,525
Think things are working?
I don't think so.

807
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:38,794
-They think they can make things better.
-By killing people?

808
01:07:38,863 --> 01:07:41,678
I don't ask too many questions.
I suggest you do the same.

809
01:07:41,743 --> 01:07:43,400
Big boy, dance.

810
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:52,293
Don't push!
Hey, you, jerk! Jeez!

811
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:15,952
Dr. Henry to ICU.

812
01:10:19,891 --> 01:10:22,705
Dr. Garcia,
stat to ambulance bay.

813
01:10:33,394 --> 01:10:36,972
Code blue, 515 west.

814
01:10:45,906 --> 01:10:48,778
Everybody clear? Three hundred.
Let's go.

815
01:10:48,852 --> 01:10:51,121
Everybody, clear.
He's got no pulse.

816
01:10:51,187 --> 01:10:53,937
Get her outta here!

817
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:55,979
He's my friend.

818
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:58,385
- Please help me.
- Let me go!

819
01:11:00,627 --> 01:11:03,922
- Hit him again. Clear.
- Alan, no.

820
01:11:03,987 --> 01:11:06,321
Get off of me!

821
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:14,601
- Mrs. Champion, I'm sorry.
- I'm not Mrs. Champion.

822
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:17,326
There were complications.

823
01:11:17,396 --> 01:11:19,250
Would you like me
to call you a cab?

824
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:22,481
You're very upset.
Can someone pick you up?

825
01:11:22,548 --> 01:11:24,753
Ma'am?

826
01:11:24,821 --> 01:11:27,243
Would you like to talk
with a counselor?

827
01:11:28,723 --> 01:11:31,091
Maybe you should lie down for a while.

828
01:11:31,156 --> 01:11:34,124
I don't understand.
You said he was gonna be fine.

829
01:11:34,196 --> 01:11:36,171
I know I did. I'm sorry.

830
01:11:36,245 --> 01:11:39,987
- We think the insulin caused...
- No, he was on penicillin.

831
01:11:40,052 --> 01:11:43,347
Dr. Champion was being held
for the treatment of diabetes.

832
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:47,406
- He went into insulin shock at 9:25.
- He was not a diabetic.

833
01:11:47,476 --> 01:11:50,379
I'm afraid he was.
I can pull up his files.

834
01:13:39,864 --> 01:13:41,107
Hello?

835
01:13:41,176 --> 01:13:45,366
You've no idea what it does to me
hearing the sound of your voice.

836
01:13:45,432 --> 01:13:49,262
Don't hang up. Please.
This is important.

837
01:13:49,336 --> 01:13:50,863
If you would...

838
01:13:50,936 --> 01:13:53,653
just take a step back
from all of this...

839
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:57,298
you'd see that you and I,
we're really not so very different.

840
01:13:57,368 --> 01:14:01,330
We're both loners.
We're both isolated.

841
01:14:01,401 --> 01:14:03,823
We're both really untrusting.

842
01:14:03,896 --> 01:14:08,654
We're both looking
for the same clarity.

843
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:11,185
You've come to mean
a great deal to me.

844
01:14:11,257 --> 01:14:13,232
You mean shit to me.

845
01:14:13,305 --> 01:14:14,614
Look...

846
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:18,707
I have to admit an arrogance
in my perceptions of you.

847
01:14:18,776 --> 01:14:21,166
I've come to visit a friend of mine.

848
01:14:22,137 --> 01:14:24,787
An old piano teacher friend
of mine.

849
01:14:24,857 --> 01:14:26,712
You leave my mother alone.

850
01:14:26,777 --> 01:14:29,144
It seems I have no choice.

851
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:32,984
She's being moved by Dr. Champion.

852
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:36,529
The late Dr. Champion.

853
01:14:55,674 --> 01:14:57,648
Shit!

854
01:14:58,778 --> 01:15:02,073
Driver, this is the Highway Patrol.
Reduce speed.

855
01:15:02,138 --> 01:15:04,724
Pull over to the side of the highway
and turn off your engine.

856
01:15:35,003 --> 01:15:36,858
There it is.

857
01:15:44,732 --> 01:15:47,220
There she is! Police!

858
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:50,388
Stop!

859
01:15:56,795 --> 01:15:59,763
My name is Angela Bennett.

860
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:05,041
Freeze! Police!

861
01:16:05,115 --> 01:16:06,970
My name's Angela Bennett.

862
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:12,183
Get down! Get down!
Get your hands around the back.

863
01:16:12,252 --> 01:16:14,586
"You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up that right...

864
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:17,587
anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

865
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:21,272
You have the right to an attorney and
to have him present during questioning."

866
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:54,197
Look, I wanna help you.

867
01:16:54,269 --> 01:16:57,847
I've been appointed to help you,
but everything you say is so farfetched.

868
01:16:57,917 --> 01:17:03,252
They've changed your name,
your friend's medical records because-

869
01:17:03,325 --> 01:17:05,878
Just think about it.

870
01:17:05,949 --> 01:17:09,244
Our whole world
is sitting there on a computer.

871
01:17:09,309 --> 01:17:11,252
It's in the computer.
Everything.

872
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:15,068
Your DMV records,
your Social Security...

873
01:17:15,134 --> 01:17:18,168
your credit cards,
your medical history.

874
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:20,790
It's all right there.
Everyone is stored.

875
01:17:20,862 --> 01:17:23,861
And there's this little
electronic shadow on each of us...

876
01:17:23,934 --> 01:17:27,196
just begging for somebody
to screw with.

877
01:17:27,263 --> 01:17:30,742
They've done it to me,
and they're gonna do it to you.

878
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:32,886
Look, Miss Marx.

879
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:35,195
I'm not Ruth Marx.
They invented her.

880
01:17:35,262 --> 01:17:37,301
They put her on your computer
with my thumbprint.

881
01:17:37,374 --> 01:17:41,781
I hate to tell you this, but the
California Criminal Justice computers...

882
01:17:41,854 --> 01:17:45,946
all of them, have been protected
by the Gatekeeper security programs...

883
01:17:46,014 --> 01:17:47,957
for the last six months...

884
01:17:48,031 --> 01:17:51,293
so nothing that you're describing
could possibly happen.

885
01:17:56,703 --> 01:17:58,907
Oh, my God.
It's the program then.

886
01:17:58,975 --> 01:18:03,448
It's... The Gatekeeper program,
it has a flaw.

887
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:07,927
If they changed my identity and it has
a flaw, then the Praetorians know this.

888
01:18:07,999 --> 01:18:11,512
- That solves it.
- Yeah. Think about it.

889
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:14,715
You want to tell me again
how you ended up in a stolen car?

890
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,791
Okay, listen to me.

891
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:18,969
It's like a Trojan horse,
this thing.

892
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,230
The Praetorians hack into computers,
and they cause this chaos.

893
01:18:23,296 --> 01:18:25,849
LAX. Wall Street.

894
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,269
The Department of Water and Power
in Atlanta.

895
01:18:29,344 --> 01:18:31,897
They do this so
the people buy this program.

896
01:18:31,968 --> 01:18:34,837
They buy this program,
and they get a false sense of security.

897
01:18:34,913 --> 01:18:37,432
Only to find out that they've
unwittingly allowed the Praetorians...

898
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:40,318
free and exclusive access
to the system.

899
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,864
Imagine what they can do with
this power. They can do anything.

900
01:18:43,936 --> 01:18:47,068
This is absolutely fascinating,
Ms. Marx.

901
01:18:47,137 --> 01:18:49,024
Please, my name is Bennett.

902
01:18:49,088 --> 01:18:51,423
Write it down if you want.
It's Bennett.

903
01:18:51,489 --> 01:18:56,061
B-E-N-N-E-T-T.
Bennett.

904
01:18:56,129 --> 01:18:58,976
I have no reason
to make any of this up.

905
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,375
As your court-appointed attorney...

906
01:19:01,441 --> 01:19:03,830
I'm obligated to do what you wish...

907
01:19:03,904 --> 01:19:07,614
so I will call you "Cleopatra,
Queen of the Nile" if you want.

908
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,884
But take some advice.

909
01:19:09,952 --> 01:19:12,374
If you go before the judge
with this craziness...

910
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:16,638
I guarantee you will be found
incompetent to stand trial...

911
01:19:16,705 --> 01:19:20,089
and they will hold you indefinitely.

912
01:19:34,018 --> 01:19:36,701
Hi. This is her daughter.

913
01:19:42,497 --> 01:19:45,280
Hi, Mom.

914
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:46,872
It's me.

915
01:19:48,097 --> 01:19:50,651
How're you doing?
You doing okay?

916
01:19:51,715 --> 01:19:54,715
How's that new nurse treating...
Is she...

917
01:19:57,858 --> 01:20:00,030
It's Angela.
Mom.

918
01:20:02,627 --> 01:20:04,515
It's Angela.

919
01:20:05,603 --> 01:20:08,057
Mom, listen.

920
01:20:08,131 --> 01:20:10,138
I need you to do something for me.

921
01:20:10,211 --> 01:20:13,593
There's a lady here
that I need for you...

922
01:20:13,666 --> 01:20:18,968
She's gonna get on the phone.
I need you to tell her that I'm me.

923
01:20:19,043 --> 01:20:21,629
'Cause she doesn't believe me.

924
01:20:21,699 --> 01:20:25,245
Can you tell her that?
Mom?

925
01:20:25,315 --> 01:20:27,421
Mom, don't. No.

926
01:20:28,548 --> 01:20:30,457
Are you there?

927
01:20:33,092 --> 01:20:36,474
I just want you to know
that I love you and...

928
01:20:43,716 --> 01:20:45,406
Lady?

929
01:20:51,075 --> 01:20:52,537
What?

930
01:20:59,428 --> 01:21:02,047
- Would somebody answer the damn phone?
- Here she is.

931
01:21:02,116 --> 01:21:05,215
Who's come to get me.
Can you just... I just...

932
01:21:05,284 --> 01:21:09,791
Special Agent Ben Phillips, FBl.
I'm Alan's triend.

933
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,999
It's a terrible thing
what happened to him.

934
01:21:12,068 --> 01:21:15,549
I'm so glad that you're here.

935
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:18,075
Two seconds after
Alan told me your story...

936
01:21:18,148 --> 01:21:21,214
the Computer Crimes Division
hit the bricks chasing this down...

937
01:21:21,284 --> 01:21:25,628
beating every bush from here
to eternity trying to find you.

938
01:21:25,701 --> 01:21:28,222
Sorry it ended up
being a place like this.

939
01:21:28,293 --> 01:21:29,951
Me too.

940
01:21:30,021 --> 01:21:32,356
Let's get outta here,
get you someplace safe.

941
01:21:32,422 --> 01:21:35,236
We've got a field office
about 40 minutes from here.

942
01:21:35,301 --> 01:21:37,156
Then what do we do?

943
01:21:37,222 --> 01:21:40,123
Then I'm going fishing.
A shark named Jack Devlin.

944
01:21:40,197 --> 01:21:42,303
- Ring any bells?
- Yeah.

945
01:21:42,374 --> 01:21:47,262
He's their one-man dirty-duty squad.
Smart, efficient, lethal.

946
01:21:47,332 --> 01:21:50,082
Moral conscience of a chain saw.

947
01:21:50,149 --> 01:21:54,459
Scary son of a bitch as he is,
the guys behind the keyboards are worse.

948
01:21:54,533 --> 01:21:55,940
The Praetorians.

949
01:21:56,005 --> 01:21:58,908
Our first good lead.
We've been chasing them for years.

950
01:21:58,982 --> 01:22:03,685
Look, we have to move A. S. A. P. so
start sketching me a quick background.

951
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:05,638
All right?

952
01:22:05,703 --> 01:22:07,360
Like for instance...

953
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:10,081
how the hell did you access
their system in the first place?

954
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:13,696
I didn't. A programmer at Cathedral
sent the disk to me.

955
01:22:15,525 --> 01:22:19,006
Goddamn disk. That's what
kick-started all this, huh?

956
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:23,615
Angie. Tell me.

957
01:22:23,686 --> 01:22:27,483
Did you make a copy of the disk
before it was ruined in Mexico?

958
01:22:39,111 --> 01:22:40,998
Damn!

959
01:22:41,062 --> 01:22:44,062
The disk is only hope we have
of catching these bastards.

960
01:22:44,135 --> 01:22:45,990
Did you talk to anyone?

961
01:22:46,055 --> 01:22:47,997
Give copies of the disk to anyone?

962
01:22:49,063 --> 01:22:51,103
You guys are amazing sons of bitches.

963
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,793
- Excuse me?
- Amazing. Amazing, amazing.

964
01:22:53,863 --> 01:22:57,027
How'd you know it was ruined?

965
01:22:57,095 --> 01:23:00,357
I only told Devlin it was ruined.
How'd you know it was ruined?

966
01:23:00,424 --> 01:23:04,254
What's your name? You're not with
the FBl. It doesn't even matter.

967
01:23:04,328 --> 01:23:07,874
Since I touched that disk, I've been
running from one nightmare to the next.

968
01:23:07,944 --> 01:23:11,206
I'm tired. I am out of it.
I'm so out of it.

969
01:23:13,383 --> 01:23:15,522
What are you doing?
Get off the gas!

970
01:23:15,592 --> 01:23:18,407
Let go! You're gonna kill us both!

971
01:23:18,472 --> 01:23:19,716
Let go!

972
01:23:22,535 --> 01:23:24,804
My seat belt!

973
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:08,322
After what appeared to be playful
but costly computer tampering...

974
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,664
an incident today
has taken a darker turn.

975
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:14,026
We go live to Dermot Conley
in Chicago with that report.

976
01:25:14,091 --> 01:25:17,986
Police were called in as the recent
comedy of computer errors turned ugly...

977
01:25:18,059 --> 01:25:21,441
when six Chicago banks were forced
to shut their doors...

978
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:25,826
due to computer tampering bringing
the city's economic life to a halt.

979
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,754
It's a desperate situation.

980
01:25:27,819 --> 01:25:32,097
City services will be conducted through
the one bank unaffected by the glitches.

981
01:25:32,172 --> 01:25:34,310
That bank, National Fidelity,
sources say...

982
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:38,340
was protected by Gregg Systems'
aptly named Gatekeeper program.

983
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:42,503
- Reporting live, Dermot Conley.
- Thank you, Dermot.

984
01:25:42,572 --> 01:25:45,507
In related news, Jeff Gregg,
billionaire founder of Gregg Systems...

985
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,435
was in Washington
for today's announcement...

986
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,500
by newly appointed Undersecretary
of Defense Calvin Shoemaker...

987
01:25:50,572 --> 01:25:53,801
that the Pentagon will be outfitting
the entire federal government...

988
01:25:53,868 --> 01:25:55,723
with Gregg's touted
Gatekeeper program.

989
01:25:55,788 --> 01:25:59,912
Remember, in this day and age,
information is sacred, is power.

990
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:04,104
And society must protect that
from terrorists.

991
01:26:04,172 --> 01:26:07,304
Ironically, today's announcement
came two weeks to the day...

992
01:26:07,372 --> 01:26:10,668
of the recent suicide of Shoemaker's
predecessor Michael Bergstrom...

993
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:13,450
a vocal opponent
of the Gatekeeper program.

994
01:26:13,517 --> 01:26:17,827
In local news, a spectacular car crash
leaves one unidentified man dead.

995
01:26:17,901 --> 01:26:21,033
We go live to Lynn Blades
at the scene of the crash.

996
01:26:21,101 --> 01:26:24,679
Thank you. I am just yards away
from where the body was found...

997
01:26:24,749 --> 01:26:27,531
with a gangland-style gunshot wound
to the head.

998
01:26:27,597 --> 01:26:30,467
Police are searching
for the passenger of that car...

999
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:34,697
a young woman in her 20s, brunette,
going under the name of Ruth Marx...

1000
01:26:34,765 --> 01:26:37,798
and believed to be wanted on federal
charges of car theft.

1001
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:24,486
All Cathedral employees,
this is a reminder...

1002
01:27:24,558 --> 01:27:26,697
that the Cathedral booth
at the Moscone Center...

1003
01:27:26,767 --> 01:27:29,702
is in the northwest corner
of the convention hall.

1004
01:28:14,576 --> 01:28:16,550
Okay. All right.

1005
01:28:19,729 --> 01:28:22,282
Mozart's Ghost!
The hottest band...

1006
01:28:22,353 --> 01:28:25,931
Don't do this to me. Do not
do this to me. I am Angela Bennett.

1007
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,691
Me.

1008
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,829
- Cathedral Software.
- Angela Bennett, please.

1009
01:28:48,848 --> 01:28:52,493
Programing. Angela Bennett.
Hello?

1010
01:28:52,562 --> 01:28:53,968
Hello?

1011
01:28:54,994 --> 01:28:57,449
Who the hell is this?

1012
01:28:59,761 --> 01:29:03,210
- You got something to say? Otherwise...
- Don't hang up.

1013
01:29:12,978 --> 01:29:14,407
Angela?

1014
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:43,375
All right, Miss Bennett,
now that I know where you are...

1015
01:29:43,443 --> 01:29:46,028
let's see if we can get you
away from your machine.

1016
01:29:51,538 --> 01:29:53,961
How about I start a little fire...

1017
01:29:54,035 --> 01:29:56,207
right here?

1018
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:00,751
This is a fire alarm.

1019
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:03,438
Please proceed
to the nearest emergency exit.

1020
01:30:13,619 --> 01:30:15,529
- Angela.
- What?

1021
01:30:15,603 --> 01:30:18,833
- There's a fire in the building.
- Yeah, just a sec.

1022
01:30:18,899 --> 01:30:22,129
Don't give me a sec.
Let's go!

1023
01:30:25,236 --> 01:30:27,091
Now! Come on!

1024
01:30:45,908 --> 01:30:48,080
Mozart's Ghost!
The hottest band on the Internet.

1025
01:30:48,148 --> 01:30:49,773
About time.

1026
01:31:03,701 --> 01:31:04,650
Password.

1027
01:31:57,942 --> 01:32:00,528
If there's a fire, where's the smoke?
There's no smoke.

1028
01:32:00,597 --> 01:32:02,933
We're looking into it, ma'am.

1029
01:32:10,519 --> 01:32:11,861
What's this?

1030
01:32:11,927 --> 01:32:15,756
"Terminate all Mozart's Ghost files now
and terminate..."

1031
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:18,197
Gotcha, don't I?

1032
01:32:19,671 --> 01:32:22,322
Who is Praetorian?

1033
01:32:30,839 --> 01:32:33,971
Okay, let's search you out.

1034
01:32:38,104 --> 01:32:39,565
It's Gregg.

1035
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:43,764
All Cathedral employees,
return to your workstations.

1036
01:32:43,832 --> 01:32:47,858
The fire department has advised us
this was a false alarm.

1037
01:32:51,799 --> 01:32:54,255
All clear.

1038
01:33:09,753 --> 01:33:12,721
Where are you?
There you go.

1039
01:33:31,321 --> 01:33:33,710
You did do this, didn't you?

1040
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:40,210
Come on!

1041
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,615
You gotta go to the john too?

1042
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:50,191
Disk, where are you?
Where are your disks?

1043
01:33:57,594 --> 01:34:00,344
Virus.
Thank you, Dale.

1044
01:34:28,411 --> 01:34:30,319
Save. Come on, come on.

1045
01:34:32,411 --> 01:34:33,620
Yes!

1046
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:40,372
Thank you.
We are going to the convention.

1047
01:34:53,595 --> 01:34:54,773
Oh, my God!

1048
01:34:57,307 --> 01:34:59,162
Security.

1049
01:35:00,475 --> 01:35:02,646
Had a break-in on the fifth floor
at Cathedral.

1050
01:35:02,716 --> 01:35:07,287
You're looking for a female,
about 5'7", brunette.

1051
01:35:24,476 --> 01:35:27,094
Did you see a brunette?
Did she come by here?

1052
01:35:27,164 --> 01:35:31,256
- Sorry, nobody came by here.
- Only people are firemen.

1053
01:35:32,285 --> 01:35:33,495
Devlin.

1054
01:35:53,437 --> 01:35:55,608
- Where is she?
- She's gotta be with the firemen.

1055
01:35:55,678 --> 01:35:58,230
We have to find her now.
She's copied the disk.

1056
01:35:58,301 --> 01:36:01,879
How the hell did that happen? You were
supposed to get rid of everything.

1057
01:36:01,949 --> 01:36:04,055
You were to put a bullet in her head.

1058
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:06,296
She should never have been alive
to make that copy.

1059
01:36:09,693 --> 01:36:12,409
Smart. Better call Gregg.

1060
01:37:14,847 --> 01:37:17,716
She's gone to the Moscone Center.

1061
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,936
Jesus! She could be anywhere.
Are you sure she's out there?

1062
01:37:35,008 --> 01:37:36,917
She's out there.

1063
01:37:36,992 --> 01:37:39,610
She won't be hiding in some corner.

1064
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:41,785
She came here to use a computer.

1065
01:39:25,794 --> 01:39:28,032
Get away from the computer.

1066
01:39:30,083 --> 01:39:33,793
What did you think you were trying
to do? Save the world?

1067
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:36,063
Not the world, just myself.

1068
01:39:36,132 --> 01:39:39,579
It's too late for that.
The offer's been withdrawn.

1069
01:39:39,652 --> 01:39:41,658
Look at the screen.

1070
01:39:41,732 --> 01:39:45,823
Everything on that disk was just sent
to the FBl. Everything.

1071
01:39:45,892 --> 01:39:47,899
So?

1072
01:39:47,971 --> 01:39:50,753
Proof that the Gatekeeper program
has a back door.

1073
01:39:52,483 --> 01:39:53,857
My, my.

1074
01:39:53,924 --> 01:39:57,371
Proof that Bergstrom and Dale's murder
were orchestrated by Gregg.

1075
01:39:57,443 --> 01:39:59,745
Watch her.

1076
01:39:59,812 --> 01:40:02,812
The beauty of the Gatekeeper system
is that we can get in the FBl...

1077
01:40:02,884 --> 01:40:05,567
like it's the public library.

1078
01:40:05,637 --> 01:40:07,742
It's a beautiful system.

1079
01:40:09,092 --> 01:40:11,644
Let's finish and get out.
These people make me nervous.

1080
01:40:14,436 --> 01:40:16,192
No harm done.

1081
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:20,123
Everything you've done will be wiped out
by just escaping the system.

1082
01:40:20,197 --> 01:40:21,571
Really?

1083
01:40:32,453 --> 01:40:36,130
Goddamn it, you're in the mainframe.
It's eating through Gregg's system.

1084
01:40:36,197 --> 01:40:37,506
Do something.

1085
01:40:38,821 --> 01:40:41,155
It's a virus eating through
the Gatekeeper program.

1086
01:40:41,221 --> 01:40:44,255
There's gonna be nothing left.
Everything will be destroyed.

1087
01:40:46,821 --> 01:40:48,927
Take the far side!

1088
01:41:19,463 --> 01:41:20,607
Stop!

1089
01:41:42,247 --> 01:41:43,294
Shit!

1090
01:42:42,025 --> 01:42:43,879
It's just you and me now.

1091
01:42:45,769 --> 01:42:48,355
Do you realize
you've changed everything?

1092
01:42:50,217 --> 01:42:53,599
Yeah. One little stroke of the key...

1093
01:42:53,673 --> 01:42:57,055
and you've wiped out my employer.

1094
01:42:58,888 --> 01:43:01,540
You've canceled my contract.

1095
01:43:01,609 --> 01:43:04,772
You've reversed everything
they've done to you.

1096
01:43:04,841 --> 01:43:08,190
Taken back your life.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

1097
01:43:27,561 --> 01:43:29,699
I knew you'd do the right thing.

1098
01:44:13,643 --> 01:44:16,458
- It's not responding to anything.
- Try a new password.

1099
01:44:58,028 --> 01:45:00,395
Excuse me, Miss.

1100
01:45:01,452 --> 01:45:04,518
I can't remember
what you told me to plant.

1101
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:09,249
Why don't I come outside
and help you?

1102
01:45:12,748 --> 01:45:15,301
The law caught up with billionaire
Jeff Gregg today...

1103
01:45:15,372 --> 01:45:19,432
as FBl agents escorted him
from his exclusive New York penthouse.

1104
01:45:19,501 --> 01:45:23,559
Gregg will be arraigned tomorrow
on nine counts of conspiracy, fraud...

1105
01:45:23,629 --> 01:45:28,451
and complicity in the death of
Undersecretary of Defense Bergstrom.

1106
01:45:28,525 --> 01:45:31,973
An FBl spokesperson attributes
the surprising arrest...

1107
01:45:32,045 --> 01:45:36,780
to a transmission sent over the Internet
by an Angela Bennett...

1108
01:45:36,846 --> 01:45:39,976
a program systems analyst
from Los Angeles.

1109
01:45:40,044 --> 01:45:43,689
In other news, San Francisco police
are investigating...

1110
01:45:43,757 --> 01:45:47,717
two mysterious deaths
at the Pan-Pacific computer convention.

1111
01:45:47,789 --> 01:45:51,051
A young woman found shot to death
in a back-room area...

1112
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:54,696
has been identified
as 28-year-old Ruth Marx.

1113
01:45:54,766 --> 01:45:59,305
The other deceased, a male
in his 30s, is as yet unidentified.

1114
01:45:59,374 --> 01:46:01,675
Turning now to weather,
the forecast for the weekend...

1115
01:46:01,741 --> 01:46:04,360
is bright and sunny
with patchy early-morning clouds.

1116
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:07,692
It seems like summer
is finally here.
