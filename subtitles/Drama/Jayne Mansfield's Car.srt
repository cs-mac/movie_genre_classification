1
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:53,297
- What do you think?
- What do you want to eat?

2
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,256
- Hell, I don't care.
- Let's get some salmon patties.

3
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,537
Well, shit.

4
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:02,303
- Man: When do we want it?
- Crowd: Now!

5
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,937
No more war! No more war!

6
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:06,898
- Man: When do we want it?
- Now!

7
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,513
- What do we want?
- Peace.

8
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:10,178
- When do we want it?
- Now.

9
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,017
- What do we want?
- Peace.

10
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:13,937
- When do we want it?
- Now.

11
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,179
Assholes.

12
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,939
Man: You should be ashamed
of yourself, Caldwell.

13
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,699
- My cousin's over there now.
- Come on, come on.

14
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:22,191
We don't want your fucking war.

15
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,900
- Hey, smile for the camera.
- One, two, three, four.

16
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,700
We don't want your fucking war.

17
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,340
One, two, three, four.

18
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,140
We don't want your fucking war.

19
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,386
Let's go.

20
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:39,900
I hear Tate Scott
might run for Sheriff

21
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:41,620
if Orville Allen retires.

22
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:44,181
Goddamn Tate Scott.

23
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:45,900
The whole damn bunch
is Yankees

24
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:48,500
got nothing running through
their veins but Cincinnati blood

25
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:50,261
from Ohio. They're from Ohio.

26
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:51,794
You ought to have
to be from here

27
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:53,612
to run for office,
the way I see it.

28
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:58,142
Well, they've been here
some 40-odd years though, Jim.

29
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,702
I don't give a shit.

30
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,023
- Born and bred a Yankee.
- Man: Okay.

31
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,942
- And plus...
- Yeah, yeah, bye.

32
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:06,052
...he got the grin of a queer.

33
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:10,103
Jim, there's a riot going on
down the street.

34
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,463
The police force has arrested
a bunch of hippies.

35
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,152
Your boy's the ringleader.

36
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:15,935
Oh.

37
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:24,663
Would you do the same thing
if we were the Klan?

38
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:26,991
You think the Klan would let
a bunch of dopeheads

39
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,222
like y'all in?

40
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,504
Seriously, man.

41
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:30,624
That's not what I'm saying.

42
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,225
What in God's name's
going on here?

43
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:34,665
You, get up. Come on.

44
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:36,746
Get up. Get up here.
Come on.

45
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:38,705
Come on, come on, come on.

46
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:41,025
Come on. Come on.

47
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:43,105
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

48
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,225
Get up here.
God damn it.

49
00:03:45,386 --> 00:03:46,706
You're making me look bad.

50
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,066
You un-American son of a bitch,
you're making me look bad

51
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:50,945
- out there on the street.
- That's bullshit, Daddy.

52
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,825
No, it's not bullshit. Hey.

53
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:53,944
Hey.

54
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:58,626
Well, that's real brave,
hitting me when I'm handcuffed.

55
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:01,786
Yeah? Well, I'll un-handcuff
you, you little bastard,

56
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:03,867
then I'll beat the living
dogshit out of you.

57
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:06,427
I'm tired of getting you bailed
out of all your monkey business.

58
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:07,667
Now you go to the jailhouse,

59
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:09,987
act like a human being
and apologize.

60
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:13,628
And I'll come post your bail and
I'll try to straighten it out,

61
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,108
if that's possible.
All right?

62
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:19,268
- You're a sad old man.
- Yeah? Oh.

63
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:21,747
- I'll bail myself out.
- All right.

64
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,108
You go your way
and I'll go mine.

65
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,188
Right. Then you go your way
right to the jail.

66
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:29,707
- Take him away.
- Come on, Carroll.

67
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,189
- Take him away.
- Let's go.

68
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,949
Go on, arrest his ass.

69
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,028
Bastard.

70
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:11,951
What's up, baby?
What's up?

71
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,471
Hey. Daddy feed you all right?
Daddy feed you?

72
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:17,592
Daddy feed you, huh?
Did Daddy feed you?

73
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:19,953
Come on. Come on.

74
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,634
What's the word, Jimbo?

75
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:40,793
Jimbo: Shit, I don't know.

76
00:05:57,796 --> 00:05:59,555
Where's Daddy?

77
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,515
Shit, I don't know.

78
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:04,036
He took off in his truck.

79
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,796
He's been acting weird lately
like everybody else

80
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:07,396
in this fucking family.

81
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,998
Skip,

82
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,359
the salad dressing's mixed.

83
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,078
Oh, Skip, if you're gonna be
up all night,

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,799
you're gonna have to
cut down the radio.

85
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,319
I've been listening
to underground music.

86
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,279
Carroll got me
to doing it, yeah.

87
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,119
It's real different kind of
music.

88
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,600
But the program don't start
till midnight,

89
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:06,800
so that's how come
I had to be listening so late.

90
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:10,641
Well, it don't sound
like it's underground.

91
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:13,321
It sounds like it's right
in the room with me.

92
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,002
Carroll says if you listen
to underground music,

93
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:19,082
it'll open your mind up.

94
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:22,601
That means just take LSD...

95
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:25,082
opening your mind.

96
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:27,201
Goddamn Carroll.

97
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,521
That's all this town needs...
a damn hippie peace march.

98
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:34,963
A bunch of filth lying around
the park in their own shit.

99
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:37,802
Carroll says we got no business
being in Vietnam.

100
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:40,762
He says it's in vain
or something.

101
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:42,243
That's easy for Carroll to say.

102
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:43,802
He ain't fighting
the little bastards.

103
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,324
Somebody's got to fight
the bastards.

104
00:07:48,204 --> 00:07:51,764
You know, Carroll actually did
his fighting, Jimbo.

105
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:57,004
What's that supposed to mean?

106
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,084
Tell me, Skip.

107
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:08,404
Uncle Carroll says that he's
fighting for freedom and peace.

108
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:10,365
Shut up.

109
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:12,445
In a peaceful way.

110
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:14,005
Shut up.

111
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,085
Jimbo, come on, honey.

112
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:20,805
You ain't one to talk.
You're 50 years old,

113
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,247
still living at home,
driving up and down the road

114
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,206
in them sports cars
like a damn teenager.

115
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,927
You got no kind of life,
no kind of job,

116
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:31,767
chasing after any old wore-out
whore who will talk to you.

117
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:36,206
You're nearly 50
and you live here too, Dad.

118
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:39,407
I thought I told you
to shut up.

119
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:42,927
Take it easy, honey.

120
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:47,007
Jimbo:
At least I didn't turn out to be

121
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,008
some freak like you
and him did.

122
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,808
Why don't you go live with him,
polish each other's medals...

123
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:57,009
while you're protesting
the damn war?

124
00:09:14,571 --> 00:09:16,690
They say Tate Scott
might run for Sheriff.

125
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:19,770
If that damn Yankee gets in,
we're all screwed.

126
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,611
We'll be eating Cincinnati chili
full of cinnamon in it.

127
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,771
- How would you like that?
- A phone call, Mr. Caldwell.

128
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,250
Well, I'm eating my supper.

129
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,770
Tell them I'll call them back.

130
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:33,011
It's long-distance

131
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,931
from England.

132
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:38,092
- From where?
- England.

133
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,532
England?

134
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:44,252
Hmm.

135
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:47,252
Uh-huh. England?

136
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,812
Hello.

137
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:55,732
Man: Mr. James Caldwell?

138
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:58,813
Yeah. Yeah, this is
Jim Caldwell.

139
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,493
This is Phillip Bedford,
Mr. Caldwell.

140
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:13,935
Well...

141
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:18,415
that was Phillip Bedford...
that son of a bitch's son.

142
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,775
Jimbo:
What the hell did he want?

143
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:27,175
Your mama's dead, son.

144
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,696
Died today of cancer.

145
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:32,056
Yeah.

146
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,575
Wants to be buried here
with her people,

147
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,576
so they're bringing her back.

148
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:37,536
Who's bringing her back?

149
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:39,696
That English bastard
and his kids.

150
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:45,497
Well, they can't come here.

151
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:47,296
They ain't welcome.

152
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:48,536
Well, I ain't happy
about it neither,

153
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:50,457
but we got to put up with it.

154
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:55,178
She deserves to be
with her people.

155
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,258
It don't matter
what she done to us.

156
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,097
So...

157
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:04,578
I believe

158
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:07,258
the funeral's on Saturday.

159
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:09,978
All right?

160
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,658
Tell your brothers

161
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:15,858
and call your sister.
Yeah.

162
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,778
Jimbo: Yes, sir.

163
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,740
Lord have mercy.

164
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,059
Yeah. Yeah.

165
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:33,020
Dorothy:
Poor Miss Naomi,

166
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:35,940
dying all the way over there
in England.

167
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:38,700
I only met her that one time
when I was little.

168
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:42,141
She was a free-spirited woman.

169
00:11:43,982 --> 00:11:47,181
How come her to leave
Mr. Caldwell like that?

170
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:49,141
I love Jim Caldwell,
but he ain't

171
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:51,421
the most romantic man
in the world.

172
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:57,101
And Miss Naomi...
she wanted to travel,

173
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:01,022
see new things.
And he wouldn't take her.

174
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:05,222
So one time she just
up and went by herself.

175
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:07,823
Met that man over there.

176
00:12:07,984 --> 00:12:10,743
Then she come back over here,

177
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,783
divorced Mr. Caldwell,

178
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,783
went back over there

179
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,784
and married Mr. Bedford.

180
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:21,103
I think he thought

181
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:24,304
she'd come back to him
one day.

182
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:33,864
Not like this.

183
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,985
JD, JD.

184
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:37,945
Mm. Yeah, bud?

185
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:39,985
I had some strawberry mescaline
go missing.

186
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:43,346
It wouldn't happen to be
in your brain now, would it?

187
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:45,866
- JD: Got to be.
- Hang on, hang on.

188
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:49,385
Mm-hmm, I got all that good shit
traveling around my brain.

189
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,627
Just play nice next time,

190
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:53,066
partner, and ask.

191
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,027
- What, baby? What?
- Look.

192
00:12:57,187 --> 00:12:59,586
♪ You will bear someone else's ♪

193
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:02,067
♪ Fertile seed... ♪

194
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:05,667
Well, okay.

195
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,507
♪ Evil woman, don't play ♪
♪ your games with me... ♪

196
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:13,147
Hey, buddy.

197
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:15,227
What's going on?

198
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:23,228
Are you okay, buddy?

199
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,668
When did Mama
visit us last time?

200
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:28,869
Was it last 4th of July?

201
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,669
No. No, it was, like,

202
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:34,628
six, seven years ago

203
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,548
when Aunt Mary Beth died.

204
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,510
Remember,
she brought you that hat...

205
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:40,910
that Scottish hat?

206
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,909
Mama died, Carroll.

207
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,590
They called from England.

208
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:58,192
Mama's name is gonna say
"Bedford" on her grave.

209
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:04,312
Yeah.

210
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,872
Do you have any medicine,
Carroll?

211
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:17,032
Yeah, buddy.

212
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:20,112
I got some medicine.

213
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,274
Are you all right, Father?

214
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,233
Yes, yes, I'm all right.

215
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:42,035
Please stop asking me
if I'm all right.

216
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,834
- Bloody fool.
- Good damn it, Neal.

217
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,154
One of these days
your luck is gonna run out.

218
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,075
Hey, girls,
before my luck runs out,

219
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:02,475
why don't y'all hand me
one of those beers back there?

220
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:05,035
- There you go, Daddy.
- Thank you, baby.

221
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,116
That's just what you need.

222
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:10,157
Y'all got another one?

223
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,038
Well, this looks like
it will do fine.

224
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,840
Now everybody stay here

225
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:48,359
and I'll go and register.

226
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,681
- Hello.
- Hi. Can I help you?

227
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:05,680
Yes, yes.
Uh, I have a reservation.

228
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,521
The name's Bedford.

229
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:35,323
Dispatch: We got an accident
on 271, one vehicle.

230
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:36,682
Looks like there's
one fatality...

231
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:40,083
one more car...

232
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:43,723
Let's go see that wreck before
we head to the house, all right?

233
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:47,602
Grandpa, I got to shit
pretty bad.

234
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:49,564
You can shit after a while.

235
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:54,483
Man:
it don't look good, does it?

236
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,326
Well, looky here.
There's Jim Caldwell.

237
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:08,845
I reckon that son of a bitch
shows up

238
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,206
at every wreck there is.

239
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,526
Officer: Rich folks ain't never
got nothing else to do.

240
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:14,845
- Officer #2: Hey, Jim.
- Hey.

241
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:17,206
- Officer: Jim.
- Hey, Peyton, what happened?

242
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:20,566
Hey, Jim. I guess he just
didn't make that curve,

243
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,805
hit that concrete mile marker,
I figure...

244
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:25,446
- Yeah.
- ...as far as I can tell.

245
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:26,566
Yeah, he's dead all right.

246
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:28,326
Nothing we can do till
the coroner gets here,

247
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:29,526
but he's over
at the steakhouse.

248
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:30,886
All right, let's take a look.

249
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,086
Peyton:
They're down there now

250
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:33,848
trying to figure ways
prize him out.

251
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:35,808
- Peyton: Jim, watch your step.
- Deputy: Look right here.

252
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:37,288
You think you can get in there?

253
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:38,728
Man #2:
Come on, Jim.

254
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:40,807
Let me take a look.

255
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:43,008
Yeah, you see, if you could just
go to the other side

256
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:44,128
and we could wedge
his foot out.

257
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,729
If he was a smaller man.

258
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,808
Move over a minute.
Move over.

259
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:50,768
Let me in there.

260
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:53,728
O Lord.

261
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,848
Yep.

262
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,168
Broke his neck, looks like.

263
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,649
Probably didn't know
what was going on.

264
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,369
Deader than Woodrow Wilson.

265
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,808
Grandpa, I gotta go.
I'm serious.

266
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,530
Well, go shit in the woods.
They're all around here.

267
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,130
All right? I'm trying to
figure this wreck out here.

268
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:21,410
He might have been headed
to get some pussy or something,

269
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:23,691
maybe looked up at the trees

270
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,011
for just a second too long.

271
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,931
Yeah.

272
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:30,852
There was a soul in this
Volkswagen a little while ago

273
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:33,371
thinking about something.

274
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:37,212
Now there ain't nothing more
than a voice-thrower's dummy

275
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:39,091
laying there.

276
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,451
Now it's trying to figure out...

277
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:44,091
...why he didn't make it.

278
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:54,373
Carroll: I want you to enroll
in college next semester.

279
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:57,613
Mickey: I don't want
to go to college, Dad.

280
00:18:57,774 --> 00:18:58,814
It's a waste of time.

281
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:00,933
You gotta get that
student deferment, son.

282
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:03,334
They're drafting guys
left and right your age.

283
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,214
- Hello.
- Carroll.

284
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,934
Hey, Donna, what's up?
When did you get in?

285
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:15,054
Donna: Now come on
over here and eat.

286
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:16,294
Daddy's having a cookout.

287
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,254
No, Daddy don't want me
out there.

288
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,215
Donna:
Don't be stupid.

289
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,054
- I got arrested.
- Are you shitting me?

290
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:23,295
- Yeah.
-  Oh my God.

291
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:25,256
I'll tell you about it when I...

292
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,936
Donna: Come on.

293
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,335
- Okay.
- All right.

294
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:29,696
- Okay, yeah.
- All right.

295
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,296
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

296
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:34,096
That was your Aunt Donna.

297
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,216
They just got in.

298
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,536
Neal wants us to come out to
the house and eat with them.

299
00:19:37,697 --> 00:19:39,216
Do I have to go?

300
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:41,697
Yeah, you do.

301
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:44,177
Skip. Hey.

302
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:46,257
Hey, buddy.
Hey, come on, Skip.

303
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,657
- God damn.
- Get up, buddy.

304
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,896
Why don't they just get all
of it while they're in there?

305
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:52,458
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
How are you doing, buddy?

306
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,017
- Oh, hi, man.
- Are you okay?

307
00:19:55,178 --> 00:19:56,737
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- All right, all right.

308
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:58,977
We're heading over to the house
to get something to eat, okay?

309
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:00,779
- Okay.
- Okay, so get yourself good.

310
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,938
- All right.
- Okay.

311
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,019
Yeah, looks like we're gonna set
another sales record

312
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,498
- this year.
- Donna: All right.

313
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:08,859
Of course we set sales records
every year.

314
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,979
Donna:
Bye.

315
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,259
It looked like
we weren't last year,

316
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,379
and then in that fourth quarter

317
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,459
we just started moving
Cadillacs off that lot, man.

318
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,618
- I'm telling you...
- Phillip Bedford just called.

319
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,780
- What did he want?
- He just wanted to let us know

320
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,100
they're here. They're staying
at the Pines Motel.

321
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,819
They're coming over
to eat with us.

322
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,380
I don't believe my goddamn ears.

323
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,780
You invited them bastards
over to our house?

324
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:29,660
Neal: Damn, Donna,
what's the matter with you?

325
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:31,500
They took your mama
away from you.

326
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,860
Ls this your goddamn
business, Neal?

327
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:35,460
What's going on?

328
00:20:35,622 --> 00:20:37,380
Jimbo: Donna invited them
English people over here.

329
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,421
Now she's gonna call them back
and un-invite them.

330
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:40,621
Donna: Like hell I will.

331
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,021
This isn't just about you,
Jimbo.

332
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:43,141
Mama's dead.

333
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:45,022
She's got another family
and we gotta deal with that.

334
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,982
The world don't revolve
around you.

335
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:48,902
Vicky: Oh, I guess it's too busy
revolving around you,

336
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:50,022
ain't it, Donna?

337
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,942
Oh, go make a doily, Vicky.

338
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:59,662
I wish Donna hadn't
shot off her mouth,

339
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:02,182
but now we're stuck with it.

340
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:04,983
Hard to believe

341
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:07,463
I'm fixing to meet that man
face to face.

342
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:10,302
I'm furious with you, Phillip.

343
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:12,544
You put me
in an impossible situation.

344
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,224
We're actually going to go
to this man's house?

345
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:18,784
I'm sorry, Father.
She took me by surprise.

346
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,384
She was very insistent and I
thought it very rude to say no.

347
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,704
You know how much
I detest excuses.

348
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,944
I wasn't making an excuse.

349
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:28,144
What if he attacks me?

350
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:29,304
Oh, please.

351
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:31,865
Naomi told me
some terrible stories

352
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:34,185
about his mood swings,

353
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:36,265
temper... violent temper.

354
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:39,465
Hello. I've come to compare
notes on the bug situation.

355
00:21:39,626 --> 00:21:42,345
I found the most enormous bug
racing around the loo.

356
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:44,265
You must come and see it.

357
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:46,265
We've been invited
to the Caldwell ranch, Camilla,

358
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:48,105
for a cookout.

359
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,786
I wonder if I've brought
the proper clothes.

360
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:53,267
What does one wear
to a cookout?

361
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:57,867
it is so dreadfully hot.

362
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:00,907
I feel as though
I'm swimming in treacle.

363
00:22:02,828 --> 00:22:05,307
Are we just gonna have to
sit here all day?

364
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:07,348
April: Yeah, can we go
swimming or something?

365
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:08,468
Donna:
Well, why don't y'all wait

366
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,108
for Uncle Carroll and Mickey
to get here?

367
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,628
Uncle Carroll always loves
to swim with y'all.

368
00:22:15,188 --> 00:22:17,308
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey, baby.

369
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,388
Hey.

370
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:37,350
They're here.

371
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:45,231
Fantastic.

372
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:47,471
It's like "Gone with the Wind."

373
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:50,270
Hi, everybody.
Are you Phillip?

374
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:51,750
Yes, yes. Donna?

375
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,790
That's right.
And this is my brother Skip.

376
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,111
God damn, he's
a good-looking son of a bitch.

377
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:58,231
You have any trouble
finding the place?

378
00:22:58,392 --> 00:23:01,152
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Your directions were impeccable.

379
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,151
Well, y'all come on in,
meet everybody.

380
00:23:03,312 --> 00:23:05,433
Hi, guys.

381
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,512
Come on.

382
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:11,113
This is my brother Jim, Junior...
everybody calls him Jimbo...

383
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:12,273
his wife Vicky,

384
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,512
my husband Neal,
our daughters Autumn and April.

385
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:17,233
And, let's see, Jimbo's son Alan
is somewhere around here.

386
00:23:17,393 --> 00:23:20,033
My son too... me and Jimbo.

387
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:22,673
Yep, came right out of me.

388
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:26,953
Well, I suppose it's my turn.
My name is Phillip.

389
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:30,354
This is my father Kingsley
and my sister Camilla.

390
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:32,633
Where'd Daddy go?

391
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:38,474
This is Daddy...
well, Jim, Senior.

392
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:41,234
Daddy, this is Kingsley...
I mean, Mr. Bedford.

393
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:43,115
Mm-hmm.

394
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,555
How do you do, Mr. Caldwell?

395
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:49,635
Fine. Just fine.

396
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,275
Kingsley: Well...

397
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:57,756
you have a lovely house.

398
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:01,995
Donna:
Oh, hi, guys.

399
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:03,956
This is my brother Carroll

400
00:24:04,117 --> 00:24:06,197
and his son Mickey.

401
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:08,756
- Jim: Yeah. Yeah.
- How are y'all doing?

402
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,476
A good picture
of you in the paper...

403
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:15,717
a nice, big picture, front page.

404
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:23,358
Hey there.
Phillip, isn't it?

405
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,119
Yes. And you're Neal,
Donna's husband.

406
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,438
Neal Baron.
I'm Donna's husband.

407
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:29,398
She's the daughter,

408
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:31,838
Jim and Mrs. Caldwell's
daughter...

409
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:33,759
or Belford, I guess it is,

410
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,478
or was.

411
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,398
Boy, it's a shame
about her moving on.

412
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,359
She's in a better place now,

413
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,599
better than England anyway,
from what I know of it.

414
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,919
I'm just fucking with you, son.

415
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,559
But not really. God damn,
it's miserable over there.

416
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,839
I went over there once
on business and, God damn,

417
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:50,679
I don't see how y'all do it.

418
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,920
You can't get so much
as one good meal over there.

419
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:55,760
They wouldn't know a grill
if one bit them on the ass.

420
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:59,080
And musty, God damn,
cold, shitty.

421
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:02,561
Boil everything.
They boil a goddamn Clark Bar.

422
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:04,721
Anyway, I don't mean to be
running your place down.

423
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:07,000
Well, that's quite all right.
The...

424
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:09,081
the food can be a challenge.

425
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:12,442
I'd rather live
in West Virginia as there.

426
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:15,041
Well, listen,
pleasure talking to you.

427
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:16,801
I'm gonna grab a drink,
if you'll excuse me.

428
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:18,602
Hell yeah,
let's get a cocktail.

429
00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:19,721
I'm in the car business.

430
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:22,562
I got six lots in the greater
Atlanta area, new and used.

431
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,762
Of course, I don't know
what they've told you about me.

432
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,402
Nothing actually,
but you're doing a fine job.

433
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:29,522
I'm a two-time pro baller,
defensive end.

434
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:31,482
I played six seasons
with the Lions.

435
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:34,043
I got drafted by Baltimore,
but when I got traded,

436
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:36,404
I come into my own
with the Lions.

437
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:38,003
I had two pretty bad
knee injuries.

438
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:39,164
That's what did me in.

439
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:40,883
I'll show you
the operation scars later.

440
00:25:41,044 --> 00:25:42,444
They're monster.

441
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:45,484
Hey, Neal, don't you
talk poor Phillip's ear off.

442
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:48,564
Now Donna was Miss Alabama
back in the day.

443
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:52,324
Boy, you ought to have seen her.
She looked real good back then.

444
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:53,483
Donna:
Are you doing all right?

445
00:25:53,645 --> 00:25:54,604
Of course she had the kids,

446
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:57,724
and that's hard on them...
childbirth.

447
00:25:57,885 --> 00:25:59,885
Yeah, I robbed the cradle.

448
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:01,884
I got her barefoot and pregnant
right off the bat.

449
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:04,085
- That gave her something to do.
- Well, she's lovely.

450
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,405
Yeah, she's a good gal
sometimes... Donna.

451
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,045
Hey, listen, me and the girls

452
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:09,566
are headed back
after the funeral.

453
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,526
Donna's gonna stick around
for a couple of days.

454
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:14,287
But there's a big Falcons
pre-season game on Sunday.

455
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,686
I know everybody
in the organization,

456
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:18,446
being an ex-player, and I'm
kind of a big deal around there.

457
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:21,207
Do you want to go?
40-yard line. You want to?

458
00:26:21,368 --> 00:26:23,327
I'm not really familiar
with American football,

459
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:24,807
but thank you.

460
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:27,206
Oh, that's right, y'all call
kickball "football" over there.

461
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,207
Well, you ought to come with me,
watch some real football

462
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:31,968
where people don't wear
short britches.

463
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:37,527
I'm told that you are
quite the expert

464
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:39,608
of the barbecue grill.

465
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,527
What did you do to your hoof?

466
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,648
My hoof?

467
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,408
Yeah. You're on
that walking stick.

468
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,369
Oh. Yes.

469
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,929
It's been my constant companion

470
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,889
since the Great War.

471
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,769
- I was wounded in France.
- Oh.

472
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:00,169
I fixed up a lot of soldiers
in France.

473
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:03,049
Some of them just got

474
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,450
a snort of whisky
and a prayer though.

475
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,850
So...

476
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:09,810
I was a medic over there,
served under Pershing.

477
00:27:09,971 --> 00:27:12,130
Yes, well, you all did.

478
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,689
Yes, sir, we all did, yeah.

479
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:17,211
Grandpa, can we go swimming?

480
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:18,650
Do what?

481
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:19,971
Can we go swimming?

482
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:21,930
Just so you don't go half-naked.

483
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:24,251
Eh? Eh?

484
00:27:36,893 --> 00:27:39,172
Whoo!

485
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,697
What are you doing?
Eating corn?

486
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:56,618
- Mm-hmm.
-  Yeah.

487
00:28:56,779 --> 00:28:59,458
I'm Skip, the one that met you
on the porch a while ago.

488
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:01,578
I remember.

489
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:15,020
- I got three airplanes.
-  Really?

490
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:17,500
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Wow.

491
00:29:17,661 --> 00:29:21,780
I got a GTO, a Corvette
and a Chevelle.

492
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:27,821
Got a lot of lung cancer
and gall bladder trouble

493
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:30,421
in England, is what I read.

494
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:36,740
Your thoughts are so random.

495
00:29:40,942 --> 00:29:43,182
I am a thinker,
always have been.

496
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:52,262
Funny. Very funny.

497
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,582
- Do you want to go see my cars?
- Absolutely.

498
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,903
Alan: There you go, brother.

499
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:05,783
Camilla:
Mm. Oh, it's lovely.

500
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:08,302
Shit, somebody's
in my damn shop.

501
00:30:08,464 --> 00:30:10,103
- Camilla: Hmm?
- I hear music in there.

502
00:30:10,264 --> 00:30:11,623
- Somebody's in my damn shop.
- Oh.

503
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:18,064
Hi. What are y'all doing?
Smoking?

504
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:20,784
- Smoking a little reefer?
- Yeah.

505
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,304
Sorry, Uncle Skip.
We'll get out of here.

506
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:24,903
We ain't messing
with nothing.

507
00:30:25,065 --> 00:30:26,866
Just, you know, take your time,
have fun.

508
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,145
Just don't let Jimbo and Daddy
catch you, all right?

509
00:30:30,426 --> 00:30:32,225
- All right?
- You got it.

510
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:33,625
- Skip: All right.
- Camilla: Ciao.

511
00:30:33,787 --> 00:30:35,185
Maybe turn the music down
or something.

512
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:36,626
- All right.
- Camilla: Not too much.

513
00:30:36,787 --> 00:30:38,346
Can you turn
the music down?

514
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:42,226
Oh, man,

515
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:43,985
Grandpa would kill us
if he caught us.

516
00:30:45,588 --> 00:30:47,706
I mean, really kill us probably.

517
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:53,946
Yeah, your old man and Grandpa
are both real uptight.

518
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:56,947
One time Grandpa
sees me lighting up

519
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:59,547
is when he's dragging my ass off
to a car wreck

520
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,506
or a drowning.

521
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:04,948
That's some weird shit, man.
He brought me out to see when...

522
00:31:05,109 --> 00:31:06,988
when Floyd Carver
shot that guy

523
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:09,348
from the employment office
in the belly.

524
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:12,067
Oh, yeah.

525
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:14,229
Did he die?
I can't remember.

526
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,149
The dude killed
the shit out of him.

527
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,349
I saw his guts
and everything.

528
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,628
Daddy says Grandpa
needs a trip.

529
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:22,709
He says it might
loosen him up some.

530
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,629
He don't even know
what acid is probably.

531
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,029
Imagine that... Grandpa tripping?

532
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,989
That's some funny shit
right there.

533
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:35,469
You know, I got some acid,
you know.

534
00:31:35,631 --> 00:31:38,110
If you want some,
if you want to try.

535
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,991
Okay.

536
00:31:44,232 --> 00:31:45,550
Yeah.

537
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:47,511
Here we are.

538
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,311
Oh!

539
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:51,471
I feel as if I went
to an art opening

540
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:53,192
for automobile lovers.

541
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:54,591
Oh.

542
00:31:54,752 --> 00:31:56,831
Automobile lovers?
I like the way that sounds.

543
00:31:56,992 --> 00:31:57,952
The fact of the business,

544
00:31:58,113 --> 00:32:00,472
I like the way
everything you say sounds.

545
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:02,752
I wish I could speak English.

546
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:04,272
Anyhow, this here
is the Wildcat,

547
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:05,392
United States Navy.

548
00:32:05,552 --> 00:32:06,752
That's what I flew in the war.

549
00:32:06,914 --> 00:32:08,912
The car's name is GTO,
nicknamed Goat.

550
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:11,112
Why do you compare your cars
to airplanes?

551
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:13,712
Oh, I cook up missions
all over the county...

552
00:32:13,873 --> 00:32:17,113
keeps my head in the clouds.

553
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:20,314
Anyhow, the Wildcat...
the thing about this plane was,

554
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:22,833
it was the very first American
fighter in the Pacific,

555
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:23,953
which is where I fought
in the war.

556
00:32:24,114 --> 00:32:25,074
Oh.

557
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,354
Anyhow, right here...
step on over here.

558
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:29,274
- Camilla: Oh, look at this one.
- Oh, yeah.

559
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:34,275
That's your Hellcat.
The car's name is Chevelle.

560
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,235
You see it right there.

561
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:38,554
Chevelle's a little quicker
than GTO,

562
00:32:38,716 --> 00:32:41,274
handles better too.

563
00:32:42,235 --> 00:32:44,035
And the grand finale
over here...

564
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,114
Oh, I love this one. Oh.

565
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:48,634
It's something.

566
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:50,395
- Does it go fast?
- Yeah, it does.

567
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:51,995
- I bet it does.
- They all do.

568
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:53,636
Mm.

569
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:56,476
Now the Corsair had
11:1 kill ratio.

570
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:57,996
- This... don't sit on it.
- Oh.

571
00:32:58,157 --> 00:32:59,636
- Don't sit on it.
- Terribly sorry.

572
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:01,116
It's okay.

573
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:04,517
Anyhow, the Corsair had
11: 1 kill ratio

574
00:33:04,677 --> 00:33:06,916
and the Corvette...
11: 1 compression ratio.

575
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:08,916
- Isn't that something else?
- Lt is. it really is.

576
00:33:09,077 --> 00:33:11,037
It's a beautiful,
beautiful machine.

577
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,598
I'll tell you what:
I love this thing.

578
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,557
Now see, notice how
the hood's so long,

579
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:17,877
that pretty hood, longer than
the ass end so much, see?

580
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:21,798
Well, in a Corsair, from
the cockpit to the propeller...

581
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,757
14 feet.
See there?

582
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,438
I do. Do you know

583
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:29,919
you're like a little child
when you talk about them?

584
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,559
What do you mean?
A kid can't fly these things.

585
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,360
Well, it's just not any son
of a bitch that can handle them.

586
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:40,840
I mean, you can make a mistake
pretty easy, believe me.

587
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:43,880
Have I upset you?

588
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,840
They're beautiful.

589
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,319
Yes, they are.

590
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,000
I feel real strange about Mama.

591
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:06,482
Dear Naomi...

592
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:09,362
what an eccentric creature
she was.

593
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,441
I wonder why she didn't tell us
she was sick.

594
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:17,882
She just didn't want you
to worry.

595
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:21,762
There was nothing
you could do.

596
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,402
Your accent sure is pretty.

597
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:33,283
I could listen to you talk
all day long.

598
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:41,362
I need to smoke a reefer with my
nephews. You want to go with me?

599
00:34:41,524 --> 00:34:44,485
Yes, I do. Thank you.

600
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:47,204
I noticed you didn't eat much.
You don't like Daddy's cooking?

601
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:49,604
Oh, no, no, no.
It's... it's not that.

602
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:52,485
Um, I'm sure it's wonderful,

603
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:54,725
but I can only eat
a very bland diet.

604
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:57,444
How come?

605
00:34:57,606 --> 00:35:00,165
I was a prisoner during the war,
of the Japanese.

606
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:04,165
The culinary skills of the Jap
cooks left a lot to be desired.

607
00:35:04,326 --> 00:35:06,365
My insides were left
a bit of a wreck.

608
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:08,846
Oh. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be nosy.

609
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,086
No, that's quite all right.

610
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:13,446
All three of my brothers
were in the war.

611
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:15,366
Carroll was in the marines.
He was a medic.

612
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:18,006
Skip was a pilot in the navy.
They both got decorated.

613
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,767
Jimbo was in the army,
but he don't talk about it much.

614
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:22,727
He ran the laundry
at Fort Polk.

615
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,807
He's so damn jealous
of the other boys' medals,

616
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:26,766
you'd think
he was in high school.

617
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:29,367
Well, he shouldn't feel
that way. He did his bit.

618
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,928
Yeah, try telling Jimbo that.

619
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,367
Try telling Jimbo anything.

620
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,368
He's Daddy's boy all right.

621
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:39,208
Families can be difficult.

622
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:42,488
They sure can.

623
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:52,488
So are you married?

624
00:35:52,649 --> 00:35:53,928
Divorced.

625
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:55,409
Oh.

626
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,610
You got any kids?

627
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,250
No.

628
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,290
Is she pestering the shit
out of you, Phil?

629
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,289
No, no, no, not at all.

630
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,770
Neal, get me a beer.

631
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,370
Well, shit, you got legs.

632
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:23,891
Well, may I thank you for your
hospitality, Mr. Caldwell?

633
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:27,771
The barbecue was superb.

634
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:30,251
Yeah, well, see you tomorrow.

635
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:37,373
Hey, sweet ass.

636
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:39,332
Hey, come here a minute.

637
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:41,413
Come here a minute. Yeah.

638
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:47,573
Camilla:
Hey, you're blotto.

639
00:36:49,894 --> 00:36:51,693
Hey, listen, there's something
I was thinking about.

640
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:53,653
I just want to ask you...

641
00:36:56,254 --> 00:36:58,654
This English accent of yours...

642
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,934
there's something about it.

643
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,013
There's just something about it.

644
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:07,815
Now,

645
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:12,175
uh, I know we don't know
each other that good yet.

646
00:37:12,336 --> 00:37:14,255
And I'm sure
that you're not gonna just

647
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:17,216
actually do it
with me yet, but...

648
00:37:17,377 --> 00:37:20,256
But I was wondering

649
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:22,216
sometime can we just slip off

650
00:37:22,376 --> 00:37:24,536
and you get naked

651
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:26,897
and talk English

652
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:28,817
and recite something,
I don't know,

653
00:37:28,977 --> 00:37:31,456
and just let me
beat off to you?

654
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,656
Beat off?

655
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:35,696
Um...

656
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:37,297
beat... beat off.

657
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,257
What, have a wank?

658
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:44,937
See? That's what I'm talking
about... that damned English.

659
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:48,018
Makes me hornier
than Frank Sinatra.

660
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:50,018
"Have a wank?"

661
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:52,539
You're mad as a March hare.

662
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:55,219
I ain't mad.

663
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,498
I just get real focused
on things.

664
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:03,339
- Think about it.
- Okay.

665
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:06,939
Goodbye.

666
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:10,619
Skip:
Hey, think about it.

667
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:12,820
Dispatch:
S.O. to 44A.

668
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:13,979
Man over radio:
44A. Go ahead.

669
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,099
Dispatch: Sheriff, are you
still out at Good Frank's?

670
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,059
Give me a 10-84 to Mr. Meyer's.

671
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,179
Jim:
Mm-hmm, yeah.

672
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,300
He's making threatening phone
calls to neighbors, telling them

673
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:22,660
he's gonna kill their cat.

674
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:24,380
Caller advised
of a possible 10-96.

675
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,621
Sheriff: All right.

676
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:30,021
Dispatch:
Unit 59, 10-20?

677
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,341
- Hey.
- Hey, Daddy.

678
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:35,701
- Hey.
- How are you holding up?

679
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:37,621
Well...

680
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:41,022
all right so far.

681
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:42,781
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

682
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,983
it's all kind of hard
to think about, huh?

683
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:58,583
What?

684
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:02,823
Are you gonna be okay tomorrow,
you think?

685
00:39:02,984 --> 00:39:05,944
Tomorrow? Well,

686
00:39:06,105 --> 00:39:07,424
what about it?

687
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:09,064
The funeral.

688
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,224
Dispatch: All units,
we have a three-car accident

689
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,623
- up on Lance highway...
- Yeah.

690
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,504
- Yeah.
- Four fatalities confirmed,

691
00:39:16,665 --> 00:39:18,904
several injuries,
not real sure how many.

692
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,105
It's a shame about
ol' Naomi, you know,

693
00:39:22,265 --> 00:39:24,465
it really is.

694
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:26,425
Yeah.

695
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:28,144
You ain't fooling me.

696
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:30,904
Yeah? I gotta go.

697
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:34,586
There's a big wreck

698
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,545
right down the road.

699
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:38,506
- See you later.
- Okay, Daddy.

700
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,426
Man over radio:
In five minutes. Lance highway

701
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,587
- and Scott Ranch Road. Over.
- Dispatch: 10-4.

702
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:22,430
Let's bring in that new
mystery challenger.

703
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,239
Woman: God bless you.

704
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,919
Go on in. There you go.

705
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,400
Well, yeah.

706
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:48,040
Yeah. There you go.

707
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:49,960
Dorothy: Mr. Caldwell.

708
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:52,040
- How are you doing, Pops?
- Please.

709
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:55,481
Yeah. Yeah.

710
00:42:57,402 --> 00:42:59,321
Yeah.

711
00:43:02,282 --> 00:43:04,721
Naomi.

712
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:09,281
I forgive you this time.

713
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,442
Bye-bye.

714
00:43:30,205 --> 00:43:32,124
There you go, Mama.

715
00:43:54,285 --> 00:43:56,205
Go on, buddy.

716
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:10,766
Mama?

717
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:14,166
- Da... Daddy?
- Hey, buddy, hey.

718
00:44:14,327 --> 00:44:17,087
- Daddy?
- Hey, it's okay. it's okay.

719
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:20,206
Go on.
Go get with Dad.

720
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,169
Phillip: Father.

721
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,090
- Camilla: Father. Oh my God.
- Phillip: Okay.

722
00:44:51,251 --> 00:44:53,089
Donna: What...?

723
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,449
- Carroll: Yeah, loosen his tie.
- Father. Somebody get a doctor.

724
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,489
- Give him some air.
- Donna: Where's your phone?

725
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,569
Camilla: Father.

726
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,290
Carroll:
Hey, get some water.

727
00:45:04,691 --> 00:45:07,089
Man: There you go.

728
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:10,691
Donna: Well, somebody
ought to go with them.

729
00:45:10,852 --> 00:45:12,891
They're in a strange town.
They don't know anybody.

730
00:45:13,052 --> 00:45:14,931
Donna, we're all headed
over to the church now

731
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:16,091
for your mama's funeral.

732
00:45:16,252 --> 00:45:18,412
All right?

733
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:20,771
Carroll: She's right, Daddy.
Somebody ought to go with them.

734
00:45:20,932 --> 00:45:22,731
Yeah.

735
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,292
Donna: Oh my God,
I hope he's all right.

736
00:45:29,453 --> 00:45:30,493
What if he's dead?

737
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:32,452
Thank you.

738
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:37,372
Neal: Broken teeth and bones
and hair and shit...

739
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:39,332
I mean, it's the hardest fought
game...

740
00:45:39,494 --> 00:45:42,013
He's gonna pinch my last nerve.

741
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:44,613
Neal: We got one point
with one second to go

742
00:45:44,773 --> 00:45:46,894
- and you know what happens?
- L-l don't know.

743
00:45:47,055 --> 00:45:49,454
They missed the dang
extra point!

744
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,413
Oh, hey, babe, did they
get your mama buried all right?

745
00:45:53,574 --> 00:45:54,974
- Yeah.
- Hey, listen, I gotta get

746
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:56,894
something else to eat.
This thing tastes like shit.

747
00:45:57,055 --> 00:46:00,255
- How's your daddy doing?
- He's doing well. Thank you.

748
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:02,254
He had a heart attack
about three years ago,

749
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:03,975
so of course we were worried
about that.

750
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,935
But the doctor said
he just fainted

751
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,575
because of the stress
and exhaustion.

752
00:46:08,736 --> 00:46:10,335
He's resting now.
And Camilla's with him.

753
00:46:10,496 --> 00:46:11,775
Oh, thank God.

754
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,615
How long
are they gonna keep him?

755
00:46:13,776 --> 00:46:17,175
They said they'd release him
in... in... in a bit.

756
00:46:17,336 --> 00:46:19,815
But they don't want him
to travel for a day or two,

757
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:22,216
which means we...
we won't be leaving tomorrow.

758
00:46:22,378 --> 00:46:24,177
Well, he can't stay
at the Pines Motel.

759
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:26,336
I mean, none of y'all should
be there in the first place.

760
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:28,377
That ain't nothing but
an after-prom fuck joint.

761
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:30,336
No telling whose jizz
y'all are sleeping on.

762
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:32,657
Y'all are staying at Daddy's.

763
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:34,777
That's very kind,
but we couldn't possibly.

764
00:46:34,938 --> 00:46:36,177
Oh, yes,
you could possibly.

765
00:46:36,337 --> 00:46:39,096
I think it's a great idea.
Daddy would insist.

766
00:46:39,258 --> 00:46:40,298
Neal: All right, girls,
let's go.

767
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,577
We got shit to do.

768
00:46:41,738 --> 00:46:43,337
Phillip: Neal, thank you so much
for your help at the hospital.

769
00:46:43,498 --> 00:46:44,457
Neal:
Hey, no sweat, slick.

770
00:46:44,618 --> 00:46:45,577
Take care of yourself,
all right?

771
00:46:45,738 --> 00:46:47,138
Donna: Y'all drive safe.
Call me when you get there.

772
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:49,177
Hey, Neal,
keep it on the road.

773
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:50,978
Bye, babies.

774
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:52,978
Neal: Hand me one of
those beers back there.

775
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:54,178
- Aunt Donna.
- Yeah?

776
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:55,858
Uh, Connell's band's
playing tonight.

777
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:56,978
Really?

778
00:46:57,139 --> 00:46:58,820
Yeah, at the main dollar store
parking lot.

779
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,939
And I'm doing the sound
and the lights.

780
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,139
Uh, you ought to come.

781
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,339
- All right.
- All right?

782
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,339
- Okay, I'll see you later then.
- I'll see you there.

783
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Okay.

784
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:10,300
I feel like dancing anyway.
Let's go dance.

785
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:12,380
I should stay here
with my father.

786
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:13,819
You need to relax.

787
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:14,940
There's a whole house
full of people

788
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:16,540
to take care of your daddy.

789
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:19,781
Well, I'm not really a dancer.

790
00:47:19,942 --> 00:47:22,260
Well, you will be
when I get through with you.

791
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,781
Hey, what's going on?

792
00:47:34,261 --> 00:47:38,183
Any gruesome car crashes?
Any homicides?

793
00:47:38,343 --> 00:47:40,622
No, doesn't appear to be, no.

794
00:47:40,783 --> 00:47:42,902
Too bad.

795
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:45,502
Hey, let me ask you a question.

796
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:49,302
How cold can it be in there?

797
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:54,743
Is it really that dark
and cold inside you

798
00:47:54,904 --> 00:47:57,583
that you can't even hug
your own son

799
00:47:57,744 --> 00:47:59,983
on the day
of his mama's funeral?

800
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:03,743
You're drunk. Go home.

801
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:06,503
Yeah. Hey,

802
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:09,024
let me ask you
another question.

803
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:13,185
You remember when I was
wounded on Saipan,

804
00:48:13,346 --> 00:48:15,545
I was in the hospital
for three months?

805
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:16,785
Jim: Of course I do.

806
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:19,145
Yeah, I wrote you a letter

807
00:48:19,306 --> 00:48:21,745
from that hospital.

808
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:23,345
I spilled my guts out to you.

809
00:48:23,506 --> 00:48:25,625
I told you everything
you ever meant to me,

810
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:28,305
about how when I signed up,

811
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:31,386
I became a medic 'cause you were
a medic in World War I

812
00:48:31,546 --> 00:48:33,745
and... and...

813
00:48:33,906 --> 00:48:37,065
and how I didn't mind
getting shot because...

814
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:40,826
'cause I figured that you was
finally, you know, proud of me

815
00:48:40,987 --> 00:48:45,426
and how I admired you more
than anybody else in the world,

816
00:48:45,587 --> 00:48:47,787
even President Roosevelt.

817
00:48:47,948 --> 00:48:49,748
And you never wrote me back.

818
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:51,788
I mean, you never said
one word about that letter,

819
00:48:51,949 --> 00:48:52,947
not to this day.

820
00:48:53,108 --> 00:48:55,668
I never got a letter like that.

821
00:48:57,389 --> 00:48:59,628
You're lying, Pops.

822
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:02,388
Donna told me
she saw you reading that letter.

823
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:05,949
Your sister must be
mixed up or something.

824
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:10,548
Your letter must have got lost,
lost in the mail.

825
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,189
You know,

826
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,428
I used to think
that you were seven feet tall.

827
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:25,630
I spent my whole childhood
just trying to be

828
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:28,991
just... just like you.

829
00:49:29,151 --> 00:49:32,190
God damn, I'm glad
I didn't succeed.

830
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:34,151
Hmm.

831
00:49:34,312 --> 00:49:36,111
Yeah.

832
00:49:36,272 --> 00:49:39,271
You turned out real good.

833
00:50:00,593 --> 00:50:02,753
Man: ♪ I came ♪

834
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:06,033
♪ I saw ♪

835
00:50:07,514 --> 00:50:09,434
♪ He said ♪

836
00:50:10,555 --> 00:50:12,474
♪ He fled... ♪

837
00:50:13,955 --> 00:50:16,073
"'Forward, the Light Brigade!

838
00:50:16,234 --> 00:50:18,033
Charge for the guns!' he said:

839
00:50:18,194 --> 00:50:21,273
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred."

840
00:50:50,517 --> 00:50:52,196
"Cannons to the right of them,

841
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:54,796
Cannons to the left of them,
Cannons in front of them

842
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:56,437
Volley'd and thunder'd;

843
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:59,197
Storm'd at with shot and shell,
Boldly..."

844
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:01,277
I'm glad you came
and loosened up a little.

845
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:05,597
Me too.
I actually had fun.

846
00:51:05,758 --> 00:51:07,197
"Cossack and Russian

847
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:09,157
Reel'd from the sabre-stroke

848
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:11,677
Shatter'd and sunder'd."

849
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:19,838
"Then they rode back,

850
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:21,918
but not the six hundred."

851
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,640
Connell: Man, I gotta
tell you something,

852
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,639
but you can't tell a soul,
especially my grandmother.

853
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:43,999
Mickey: All right, man.

854
00:51:44,161 --> 00:51:46,520
Connell: I got a problem, man.

855
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:49,600
What is it?

856
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:52,080
I mean, I really got a problem
right now.

857
00:51:53,722 --> 00:51:55,201
All right.

858
00:51:56,962 --> 00:51:59,881
I got this in the mail today,

859
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:02,322
thought you should
check it out.

860
00:52:19,044 --> 00:52:20,963
Well, shit, man.

861
00:52:29,124 --> 00:52:31,484
What are you gonna do?

862
00:52:31,645 --> 00:52:33,844
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

863
00:52:44,646 --> 00:52:46,445
Yeah.

864
00:52:46,606 --> 00:52:48,525
Come in.

865
00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:54,765
May I?

866
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:57,405
Oh, Mr. Caldwell.

867
00:52:57,566 --> 00:52:59,005
Yeah.

868
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:03,046
I just

869
00:53:03,207 --> 00:53:06,086
wanted to see
how you were feeling.

870
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:08,486
A great deal better,
thank you.

871
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:10,446
Well, that's...

872
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:12,807
that's good.
Good to hear.

873
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:14,887
Yeah.

874
00:53:18,088 --> 00:53:20,247
Good night.

875
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:22,568
Good night, Mr. Caldwell.

876
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:26,047
Uh...

877
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:29,608
I got a question for you.

878
00:53:31,129 --> 00:53:33,208
Yes?

879
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:36,648
How did y'all meet...
you and Naomi?

880
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:44,329
Well...

881
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,770
I was taking my dog Molly

882
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:53,570
for a walk in Hyde Park
one morning...

883
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,170
a border terrier,
a wonderful dog.

884
00:53:57,971 --> 00:54:00,810
And my wife had died
a year previously.

885
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:04,690
Molly had become
my constant companion,

886
00:54:04,851 --> 00:54:07,371
always trying
to lift my spirits.

887
00:54:09,452 --> 00:54:11,730
I noticed...

888
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:16,491
a very attractive woman
standing by the bronze statue

889
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:18,812
of St. George
slaying the dragon.

890
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:23,252
And she had a camera,

891
00:54:23,413 --> 00:54:25,933
obviously a tourist.

892
00:54:26,093 --> 00:54:28,852
And she spotted me

893
00:54:29,013 --> 00:54:31,772
and she asked me

894
00:54:31,933 --> 00:54:34,373
in a very attractive
Southern American accent

895
00:54:34,534 --> 00:54:36,493
if I'd care to take her picture.

896
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:38,852
Of course
I said I'd be delighted.

897
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:41,052
So she gave me the camera.
And I was expecting her

898
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:43,013
to stand in front of the statue
and smile.

899
00:54:43,175 --> 00:54:45,134
I'd take a snapshot of her,
I'd give her the camera back

900
00:54:45,294 --> 00:54:47,493
and we'd go our separate ways,
but not a bit of it.

901
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:50,613
Not a bit of it.

902
00:54:50,774 --> 00:54:54,893
No, instead she absolutely
astonished me

903
00:54:55,055 --> 00:54:57,135
by climbing on the back
of the horse,

904
00:54:57,296 --> 00:55:00,456
sitting astride it
behind St. George

905
00:55:00,617 --> 00:55:02,536
as quickly...

906
00:55:08,816 --> 00:55:12,335
and as nimbly as a monkey.

907
00:55:15,336 --> 00:55:18,095
Sounds like her, yeah.

908
00:55:18,256 --> 00:55:20,496
I was laughing so much,

909
00:55:20,658 --> 00:55:23,056
I had difficulty in taking
the picture properly.

910
00:55:30,938 --> 00:55:33,297
Anyway...

911
00:55:36,258 --> 00:55:38,538
that's how I met

912
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:40,098
Naomi.

913
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:43,938
I just always
wondered about it.

914
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:46,379
Always wondered.

915
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,459
Yeah.

916
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,579
Hey, kid. What's up?

917
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,740
Just going outside
for a smoke. You?

918
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:13,140
Just having my cereal.

919
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:16,261
You're up early.

920
00:56:16,422 --> 00:56:17,781
Not really.
I ain't been to bed yet.

921
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:19,181
How come?

922
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:22,581
Connell and me
were up all night talking.

923
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,901
Connell got drafted.

924
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:32,981
Shit.

925
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:34,741
Does Dorothy know yet?

926
00:56:34,902 --> 00:56:36,701
No, he ain't told her yet.

927
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:39,102
Man.

928
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:42,062
Poor thing.
She loves that kid to death.

929
00:56:43,623 --> 00:56:45,782
It's weird, Daddy.

930
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:49,022
How can government just come and
tell you what to do like that?

931
00:56:50,704 --> 00:56:53,784
He was gonna go to California,
get in the music scene.

932
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:57,463
- It's fucked up.
- I know. it ain't right.

933
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:00,024
I mean, that's why I'm telling
you you gotta get in college.

934
00:57:00,185 --> 00:57:01,984
That's why I'm against it,
you know?

935
00:57:02,145 --> 00:57:04,824
So a kid like Connell
that has a dream

936
00:57:04,985 --> 00:57:06,303
gets a chance to live it.

937
00:57:08,986 --> 00:57:10,944
But, you know,
there is something cool

938
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:12,145
about it though...

939
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:14,505
Connell being a soldier.

940
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,105
No, son.

941
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:19,225
There's nothing cool about it.

942
00:57:28,547 --> 00:57:31,266
Jimbo: Well, looky there.

943
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:33,466
Here we go.

944
00:57:33,627 --> 00:57:36,667
Nobody else is going to church.
Why do we have to?

945
00:57:37,908 --> 00:57:39,987
'Cause we always go to church.

946
00:57:40,148 --> 00:57:42,266
Because we love the Lord.

947
00:57:42,427 --> 00:57:43,547
Well, we went to church
yesterday.

948
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,027
No, we didn't, God damn it.

949
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:46,947
We went to a funeral.
It's different.

950
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:53,467
Hello.

951
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:02,268
Hello. Good morning.

952
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,629
♪ And then the hydrogen atom, ♪

953
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:08,669

- What are you doing?

954
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:10,389
Getting the car on?

955
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:11,830
I'm just fiddling
around in here.

956
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,989
What are you doing?

957
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:14,749
Oh.

958
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,389
It's hot.

959
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,589
- Skip: Yeah.
- Very hot.

960
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:22,590
So when are you gonna get naked

961
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:25,149
and recite something to me
in your accent, hmm?

962
00:58:26,911 --> 00:58:29,070
Come on, tit for tat.

963
00:58:30,231 --> 00:58:33,631
No is not
an acceptable response.

964
00:58:34,591 --> 00:58:38,071
- Listen, uh...
- Hmm?

965
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:46,871
Yes?

966
00:58:47,832 --> 00:58:49,992
- Hop in.
- Okay.

967
00:59:04,513 --> 00:59:06,433
Yeah.

968
00:59:09,634 --> 00:59:12,072
Kingsley,

969
00:59:12,234 --> 00:59:14,474
you heard of Jayne Mansfield?

970
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,754
- Jayne Mansfield?
- Yeah.

971
00:59:16,915 --> 00:59:18,634
Yeah, the film star,

972
00:59:18,795 --> 00:59:22,594
blonde with those...

973
00:59:22,755 --> 00:59:24,955
Titties. That's right.
That's right.

974
00:59:25,116 --> 00:59:27,274
Well, she was killed

975
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:29,914
a couple of years back
in a car wreck in Louisiana.

976
00:59:30,076 --> 00:59:32,195
And a friend of mine
just called from town.

977
00:59:32,355 --> 00:59:34,555
They have the very car
she was killed in

978
00:59:34,716 --> 00:59:36,316
out at the discount store.

979
00:59:36,476 --> 00:59:38,755
And they're selling tickets.
And it's a big deal.

980
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:41,515
And I darn near forgot
it was today.

981
00:59:43,237 --> 00:59:45,596
Would you like to come with me?
Come on. All right?

982
00:59:45,757 --> 00:59:47,195
- Oh.
- Let's go.

983
00:59:48,477 --> 00:59:50,436
All right.

984
00:59:53,078 --> 00:59:54,997
How grotesque.

985
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,558
it's a good spot.

986
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,838
I come out here
to do my thinking.

987
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:28,680
I used to bring
Patty Overton out here

988
01:00:28,841 --> 01:00:31,120
and just wear her ass out.

989
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:35,000
That was before the war.

990
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:38,520
She married
a Primitive Baptist preacher.

991
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:42,280
She was hare-lipped

992
01:00:42,441 --> 01:00:45,520
and you needed Grandpa's
bifocals to see her titties,

993
01:00:45,681 --> 01:00:47,481
but, you know,
she had a $900 ass

994
01:00:47,642 --> 01:00:49,921
and, God damn, she could take it
right up to the gills

995
01:00:50,082 --> 01:00:51,680
without so much
as a hiccup.

996
01:00:51,842 --> 01:00:53,641
Oh, I think she sounds
like a lovely girl.

997
01:00:53,802 --> 01:00:56,002
Yeah.

998
01:01:02,642 --> 01:01:04,443
Right, enough
beating about the bush.

999
01:01:04,604 --> 01:01:06,403
Let's get on with it, fly boy.

1000
01:01:06,564 --> 01:01:09,963
I think a little
Tennessee Williams

1001
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,282
would be appropriate.

1002
01:01:12,443 --> 01:01:14,723
Do you know
"A Streetcar Named Desire"?

1003
01:01:19,004 --> 01:01:21,323
You hear that?

1004
01:01:23,685 --> 01:01:26,284
No. I don't.

1005
01:01:27,724 --> 01:01:29,643
Birds?

1006
01:01:30,884 --> 01:01:33,204
Silence.

1007
01:01:35,804 --> 01:01:38,003
That's what was hard
to get used to.

1008
01:01:38,164 --> 01:01:40,884
It still is sometimes.

1009
01:01:43,846 --> 01:01:46,005
It's kind of like floating
on a peaceful lake

1010
01:01:46,166 --> 01:01:48,485
with a tornado in your head
or something.

1011
01:01:50,447 --> 01:01:52,766
I never did want to see wrecks.

1012
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:58,325
I didn't want to know
what somebody's last thought was

1013
01:01:58,486 --> 01:02:00,406
before they died.

1014
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:05,646
I never wanted to see dead faces
looking at nothing.

1015
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:10,806
I just wanted to fly.

1016
01:02:12,928 --> 01:02:17,328
When I was a kid,
I read books on it.

1017
01:02:17,488 --> 01:02:19,568
Once in a blue moon
one would fly over

1018
01:02:19,729 --> 01:02:23,408
and I'd watch it
till it disappeared.

1019
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:26,769
So that's how come
I joined in 1940.

1020
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:29,369
We weren't even in the war
at that point.

1021
01:02:32,569 --> 01:02:34,728
I just wanted to fly up there

1022
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:37,169
in the quiet and the still.

1023
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,209
I was a navy pilot.

1024
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:46,810
How about that?

1025
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:54,249
It wasn't quiet and still
though.

1026
01:02:54,411 --> 01:02:57,651
It was loud and crazy

1027
01:02:57,811 --> 01:03:00,651
and scary.

1028
01:03:00,812 --> 01:03:04,051
But you went up
every time you were supposed to,

1029
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:06,611
did what you were
supposed to do.

1030
01:03:08,132 --> 01:03:10,931
And I went up
with three minds.

1031
01:03:11,092 --> 01:03:13,372
One mind was always thinking,
"One way or the other,

1032
01:03:13,533 --> 01:03:17,211
I'm gonna get back.
I'm gonna make it back."

1033
01:03:17,373 --> 01:03:20,491
And then another mind
was always thinking,

1034
01:03:20,652 --> 01:03:23,692
"This is probably gonna be
the last day of my life."

1035
01:03:24,653 --> 01:03:27,252
And then your third mind

1036
01:03:27,413 --> 01:03:29,211
was right down the middle

1037
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:32,373
and didn't think
about anything.

1038
01:03:32,534 --> 01:03:35,133
It wouldn't
let the other two in.

1039
01:03:39,575 --> 01:03:43,014
You know, people say they don't
like to talk about war

1040
01:03:43,175 --> 01:03:44,974
because it brings up
the bad memories

1041
01:03:45,134 --> 01:03:46,933
and the nightmares
and everything.

1042
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:49,174
I don't believe that. I believe
they don't talk about it

1043
01:03:49,336 --> 01:03:51,654
because nobody wants
to hear it.

1044
01:03:59,255 --> 01:04:01,894
See, in the early part
of the war

1045
01:04:02,056 --> 01:04:05,014
the Japanese were good pilots,

1046
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,655
better than we were really.

1047
01:04:06,816 --> 01:04:09,096
Later on we got better, but...

1048
01:04:11,297 --> 01:04:13,336
I made a mistake that day.

1049
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:17,496
It was a clear blue day

1050
01:04:17,657 --> 01:04:19,736
and he got in behind me

1051
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:24,256
and I got hit right here

1052
01:04:24,417 --> 01:04:26,497
and back up there
in the back.

1053
01:04:28,578 --> 01:04:31,817
And I couldn't believe
I'd been shot.

1054
01:04:31,978 --> 01:04:34,377
And at the same time I'd been
expecting it all the time,

1055
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:35,497
you know?

1056
01:04:35,658 --> 01:04:37,178
I... one way or another...

1057
01:04:40,538 --> 01:04:42,859
I bailed out.

1058
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,378
I didn't want to.
I was scared to.

1059
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,418
But I didn't want to burn
to death.

1060
01:04:50,579 --> 01:04:53,179
That's what we were mostly
worried about up there.

1061
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,379
Yeah.

1062
01:05:13,181 --> 01:05:15,580
You know how lucky I am?

1063
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,941
No.

1064
01:05:37,824 --> 01:05:41,622
I landed right in the middle
of the goddamn US marines.

1065
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:46,503
It knocked me out.

1066
01:05:46,664 --> 01:05:48,903
I broke my right leg,

1067
01:05:49,064 --> 01:05:51,503
collarbone, a few ribs, pelvis,

1068
01:05:51,664 --> 01:05:53,983
both hands.

1069
01:05:54,144 --> 01:05:57,663
I don't remember a lot about it,
to tell you the truth.

1070
01:06:01,265 --> 01:06:04,104
November the 12th, 1942,

1071
01:06:04,265 --> 01:06:06,745
Guadalcanal.

1072
01:06:09,186 --> 01:06:11,744
I woke up in a hospital,

1073
01:06:11,905 --> 01:06:15,665
had both my hands in casts
and my right leg,

1074
01:06:15,827 --> 01:06:18,385
just tore to pieces.

1075
01:06:20,026 --> 01:06:22,786
And...

1076
01:06:22,947 --> 01:06:25,506
the hospital got hit.

1077
01:06:29,066 --> 01:06:31,105
And I nearly burned to death.

1078
01:06:33,707 --> 01:06:36,587
I saw a guy coming at me
with a big ol' wet blanket

1079
01:06:36,748 --> 01:06:39,586
or something and he threw it
over my head.

1080
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:41,988
I thought he was trying
to kill me.

1081
01:06:44,388 --> 01:06:47,587
But he saved my face,

1082
01:06:47,748 --> 01:06:51,788
as Jimbo says,
for what that's worth,

1083
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:54,508
and got me out of there.

1084
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,908
Carroll got to come visit me
a couple of times.

1085
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:03,269
That's real special.

1086
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:09,349
And that was the end
of the war for me.

1087
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:14,869
I mean, God damn, honey, you
can't get out of your own skin

1088
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,949
no matter what it is.

1089
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:23,110
Anyhow, it takes

1090
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:25,510
five kills

1091
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,791
to become an ace.

1092
01:07:27,952 --> 01:07:30,910
And I got six.

1093
01:07:33,831 --> 01:07:36,072
I'm an ace.

1094
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,673
Skip.

1095
01:08:01,114 --> 01:08:05,033
Uh, I didn't

1096
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:06,833
beat off.

1097
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,834
Come on, I know a place.

1098
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,396
Jim: Her and her boyfriend
and her chauffeur...

1099
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:36,595
they all got killed in Louisiana
in the middle of the night.

1100
01:08:36,756 --> 01:08:39,196
The kids was in the back seat,
didn't hardly even get hurt.

1101
01:08:39,357 --> 01:08:42,116
A little ol' dog of hers...

1102
01:08:42,277 --> 01:08:44,956
...deader than Rin Tin Tin.

1103
01:08:45,117 --> 01:08:47,396
Kingsley: Yes, I can remember
when it happened.

1104
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:50,397
It's always shocking
when the rich and famous die.

1105
01:08:50,558 --> 01:08:52,597
There's no reason for us
to believe

1106
01:08:52,757 --> 01:08:53,716
that they should have immunity,

1107
01:08:53,877 --> 01:08:56,437
- but we seem to.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1108
01:08:56,597 --> 01:08:58,797
You reckon how many people
would live to ripe old age

1109
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:01,117
if we didn't go anywhere,
'cause transportation

1110
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:02,798
kills a lot of people.

1111
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:06,077
Yeah. What if the last thought
in the world was,

1112
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:08,278
"God damn it, here comes a car
across the center line

1113
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:10,719
about to kill me, 'cause I had
to get out at 10:00 at night

1114
01:09:10,879 --> 01:09:12,318
for a roll of toilet paper.

1115
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,438
Well, I wish I would have
just wiped my ass

1116
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,039
with a sweetgum leaf."

1117
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:22,958
Yes, I've been thinking a lot
about last thoughts recently.

1118
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:25,679
I hope I don't have one.

1119
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,799
Yeah?

1120
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,599
I'd rather go in my sleep

1121
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,519
so there wouldn't be
any conscious thoughts...

1122
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,199
- Oh, that's good.
- ...just a dream instead...

1123
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,760
Yeah.

1124
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:37,759
- ...hopefully a good one.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1125
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,921
Three, please.

1126
01:09:41,282 --> 01:09:43,441
Whew.

1127
01:09:43,602 --> 01:09:45,521
Yeah.

1128
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:48,481
Yeah. Yeah.

1129
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:50,761
Move over, son,

1130
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:53,042
so we get a better look.

1131
01:09:53,203 --> 01:09:55,201
Yeah.

1132
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:57,442
Mm.

1133
01:09:57,603 --> 01:09:59,922
There it is. Whew.

1134
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:02,003
Mm.

1135
01:10:02,163 --> 01:10:04,162
Yeah.

1136
01:10:05,683 --> 01:10:07,442
What they said was, there was...

1137
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:09,682
the car was headed through
a road in the swamps.

1138
01:10:09,842 --> 01:10:13,243
And there was a mosquito truck
on the road spraying pesticide.

1139
01:10:13,403 --> 01:10:15,602
And it comes drifting
across the road like a cloud,

1140
01:10:15,764 --> 01:10:17,563
just this fog of poison.

1141
01:10:17,724 --> 01:10:20,204
And this tractor trailer rig
slowed down

1142
01:10:20,365 --> 01:10:22,524
when it hit the fog.

1143
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,363
And Jayne Mansfield's car
slid right under it.

1144
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:28,044
That was it.
That was all she wrote.

1145
01:10:28,205 --> 01:10:30,004
Yeah. Mm.

1146
01:10:30,165 --> 01:10:32,445
She was decapitated,
wasn't she?

1147
01:10:32,605 --> 01:10:35,124
A lot of people think that,
but it wasn't the whole head.

1148
01:10:35,285 --> 01:10:37,204
No, it was just the top of it.

1149
01:10:37,365 --> 01:10:39,204
Yeah. Mm.

1150
01:10:42,326 --> 01:10:44,605
Kingsley, you spend
a lot of your time

1151
01:10:44,766 --> 01:10:46,204
figuring things out?

1152
01:10:48,647 --> 01:10:50,485
You know, Jim,

1153
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,765
these days I think
I spend more time

1154
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,846
accepting things.

1155
01:10:55,007 --> 01:10:57,326
Not me.

1156
01:10:57,488 --> 01:10:59,766
I spend all of my time

1157
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:01,966
figuring things out.

1158
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:04,007
Yeah.

1159
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,167
Boy:
That ain't her real head.

1160
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:08,607
Shit, don't you think
I know that?

1161
01:11:08,768 --> 01:11:11,487
My daddy says it's probably
not even really her car.

1162
01:11:11,648 --> 01:11:14,528
Ain't you got anything better
to do than to pester me?

1163
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:16,568
Huh? Huh?

1164
01:11:20,128 --> 01:11:22,567
That's right. Yeah.

1165
01:11:22,728 --> 01:11:25,208
- I'll be in the truck.
- Yeah.

1166
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:28,888
Well, mm,

1167
01:11:29,049 --> 01:11:31,529
seen enough?

1168
01:11:32,811 --> 01:11:37,129
Just about. Just about.

1169
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:39,609
Whew. Mm.

1170
01:11:43,211 --> 01:11:45,210
Mm.

1171
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:05,730
Jim: Yeah.

1172
01:12:05,891 --> 01:12:07,691
A dead man's stare

1173
01:12:07,852 --> 01:12:10,132
ain't any different than
that plastic head's stare.

1174
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:12,652
Ain't nothing
in either one of them.

1175
01:12:12,813 --> 01:12:14,972
I saw it on the battlefield
many times.

1176
01:12:15,133 --> 01:12:17,052
I'm sure you did too.

1177
01:12:17,213 --> 01:12:20,172
Yes, I'm afraid I did.

1178
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,532
The fact is

1179
01:12:22,693 --> 01:12:26,492
we all have a crash
of some sort awaiting us.

1180
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:28,973
Yeah. Hey, you hear that?

1181
01:12:29,134 --> 01:12:33,052
Yeah. Yeah.

1182
01:12:36,015 --> 01:12:37,413
I put pieces together
all the time

1183
01:12:37,574 --> 01:12:39,294
and they all fall apart.

1184
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,934
Before I can ever get it all
put together,

1185
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:45,735
they all fall apart.

1186
01:12:45,896 --> 01:12:47,815
Jim: That's it exactly.

1187
01:12:47,975 --> 01:12:49,774
Everything's been turned
upside down.

1188
01:12:49,935 --> 01:12:51,454
Yeah.

1189
01:12:53,055 --> 01:12:55,415
Listen,

1190
01:12:55,576 --> 01:12:57,615
I love my boys,

1191
01:12:57,776 --> 01:12:59,735
but for the life of me
I can't figure them out.

1192
01:12:59,896 --> 01:13:01,375
Jimbo is a good hand
around here,

1193
01:13:01,536 --> 01:13:04,616
turned out normal,
didn't even see combat.

1194
01:13:04,777 --> 01:13:07,296
The other two
was out-and-out heroes,

1195
01:13:07,456 --> 01:13:10,255
turned out to be hardly naught
but hobos.

1196
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,097
You think it'd be
the other way around.

1197
01:13:12,257 --> 01:13:13,216
Yeah.

1198
01:13:14,497 --> 01:13:16,336
Yes, well, I have to say

1199
01:13:16,497 --> 01:13:19,336
that Phillip has been a bit
of a disappointment to me too.

1200
01:13:19,498 --> 01:13:21,577
Yeah, well, times are changing.

1201
01:13:21,738 --> 01:13:24,978
Good life's disappearing.

1202
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:27,137
Sometimes I pray

1203
01:13:27,298 --> 01:13:29,217
I'm not here to see it go.

1204
01:13:29,379 --> 01:13:30,338
Oh my God, do you believe them?

1205
01:13:30,499 --> 01:13:32,098
They're acting like
long-lost buddies.

1206
01:13:32,259 --> 01:13:33,658
I know. I'm amazed.

1207
01:13:33,819 --> 01:13:35,017
Jim: Let's go sit down a bit,
all right?

1208
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:36,137
Kingsley:
it's really quite a storm.

1209
01:13:36,299 --> 01:13:37,298
Jim:
Rest your bones.

1210
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:39,578
Vicky:
Look at them.

1211
01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:42,539
No telling what they was up to
while we was at church.

1212
01:13:42,699 --> 01:13:43,978
Jim: Yeah.

1213
01:13:44,139 --> 01:13:45,858
Phillip:
I'm gonna go freshen up.

1214
01:13:46,019 --> 01:13:47,098
Donna:
Well, hey, sister Vicky.

1215
01:13:47,259 --> 01:13:48,619
Let's take a walk.

1216
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,579
Donna:
We had fun riding.

1217
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,738
It's about my sister.

1218
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,299
- Jim: You what?
- Donna: We had fun riding.

1219
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:55,939
You need to leave her
the fuck alone.

1220
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,980
Well, now, see here, I don't
know what you're getting at.

1221
01:13:58,141 --> 01:14:00,980
No, no, no, no, I'm...
I'm not pissed off at you.

1222
01:14:01,141 --> 01:14:03,140
I don't even like you.

1223
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:05,260
I only get pissed off
at people I like.

1224
01:14:05,421 --> 01:14:07,221
There's nothing in this for me.

1225
01:14:07,382 --> 01:14:09,981
This is for your own damn good.
Don't get mixed up with her.

1226
01:14:14,261 --> 01:14:16,261
The power's out!

1227
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:17,861
Jim:
See what I got to put up with?

1228
01:14:18,022 --> 01:14:21,861
Like I was fixing to tell you,
she ain't a bad gal sometimes.

1229
01:14:22,022 --> 01:14:24,941
But she can suck you down
in the hole

1230
01:14:25,102 --> 01:14:27,141
you'll never be able
to crawl out of.

1231
01:14:27,302 --> 01:14:28,941
Neal used to be
a slim, muscular,

1232
01:14:29,102 --> 01:14:30,262
good-looking,
humble guy.

1233
01:14:30,423 --> 01:14:32,541
Now he runs his mouth off
like a threshing machine

1234
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:34,663
just so he doesn't have to
hear himself think.

1235
01:14:34,824 --> 01:14:36,103
And if you look at him,

1236
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:38,343
he can't even hardly squeeze
into a damn leisure suit,

1237
01:14:38,504 --> 01:14:39,743
eats whatever you put
in front of him,

1238
01:14:39,903 --> 01:14:41,223
drinks two cases of beer a day.

1239
01:14:41,384 --> 01:14:42,743
Donna:
Like all the shit you done.

1240
01:14:42,904 --> 01:14:44,944
Jimbo: You want to have some
spending money in your pocket...

1241
01:14:45,104 --> 01:14:46,823
- Jim: Careful, careful.
- ...and not to have to work

1242
01:14:46,985 --> 01:14:49,983
like a slave,
keep your sanity, let her be.

1243
01:14:50,144 --> 01:14:52,584
She's tricky.

1244
01:14:52,745 --> 01:14:54,824
She's as whiny
as a two-week-old cat.

1245
01:14:57,225 --> 01:14:59,464
Jimbo: I ain't even sure
them's his daughters.

1246
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,624
Jim: ...stop and see
what's going on now.

1247
01:15:01,785 --> 01:15:04,064
- Jimbo: Get me?
- Jim: Hippies, dope, laziness.

1248
01:15:04,225 --> 01:15:06,905
Jim: They call it free love.
It's a free ride is what it is.

1249
01:15:07,065 --> 01:15:09,985
Kingsley: What astounds me
is the lack of respect.

1250
01:15:10,146 --> 01:15:12,786
You know, the people
that we fought

1251
01:15:12,946 --> 01:15:14,745
and that died next to us...

1252
01:15:14,906 --> 01:15:17,265
if they were to see
what was going on today,

1253
01:15:17,427 --> 01:15:19,586
they would literally
spin in their graves.

1254
01:15:19,747 --> 01:15:21,866
It's just a crying shame.

1255
01:15:22,027 --> 01:15:24,626
While our boys are fighting
in the jungle, the hippies are...

1256
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:27,946
they're singing songs
and pissing on our flag.

1257
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,027
Well, don't they realize

1258
01:15:30,188 --> 01:15:33,227
that there is a rising tide
of communism

1259
01:15:33,387 --> 01:15:35,466
that's going to sweep up onto
our shores and overwhelm us

1260
01:15:35,627 --> 01:15:38,787
if it's not stopped in places
like Southeast Asia.

1261
01:15:38,948 --> 01:15:40,947
Exactly what I've been telling
Carroll, word for word.

1262
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:43,147
Phillip: This war is not
about communism.

1263
01:15:43,308 --> 01:15:44,707
It's about nationalism.

1264
01:15:44,868 --> 01:15:46,067
The Vietnamese people
just want to be free

1265
01:15:46,228 --> 01:15:47,189
of foreign domination...

1266
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,188
first the French,
and now the Americans.

1267
01:15:49,349 --> 01:15:50,909
Jim: We ain't trying
to dominate anybody.

1268
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:52,628
We're just trying to bring
freedom.

1269
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:54,508
Phillip:
At the point of a gun?

1270
01:15:54,669 --> 01:15:57,589
Kingsley: Yeah, well, sometimes
violence is a necessary evil.

1271
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,069
That's right. That's right.

1272
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:03,588
It was my turn in '17.

1273
01:16:03,749 --> 01:16:06,469
And then Carroll and Skip had to
go off after Pearl Harbor.

1274
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:09,789
And pretty soon, well,

1275
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:12,349
it's gonna be Alan's turn.

1276
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:14,590
We need to keep Alan
around here.

1277
01:16:14,751 --> 01:16:17,029
We gotta groom him
to take over one of these days.

1278
01:16:17,191 --> 01:16:19,469
Jim: Well, now there's
plenty of time for that.

1279
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:22,190
What, you want him to come home
with a chest full of medals too,

1280
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:24,991
or get killed?

1281
01:16:25,152 --> 01:16:27,471
Or both. Hey.

1282
01:16:27,632 --> 01:16:31,311
Well, I'm just glad
I got girls and not boys.

1283
01:16:31,472 --> 01:16:33,552
Phillip: Don't you think
you've had enough, Father?

1284
01:16:33,713 --> 01:16:35,872
I mean, you're just a day
out of hospital.

1285
01:16:39,352 --> 01:16:42,272
I've had quite enough of you
hectoring me about my drinking.

1286
01:16:42,433 --> 01:16:44,272
It's one of the few pleasures
that I have left.

1287
01:16:49,112 --> 01:16:51,393
And also
I've had quite enough

1288
01:16:51,554 --> 01:16:54,833
of you posing as some sort
of military expert.

1289
01:16:54,993 --> 01:16:56,912
Well, I'm no expert,

1290
01:16:57,073 --> 01:16:59,152
but I do know something
about war.

1291
01:16:59,313 --> 01:17:00,954
I was a soldier too.

1292
01:17:01,115 --> 01:17:03,314
Oh, yes.

1293
01:17:03,475 --> 01:17:05,234
I'd forgot.

1294
01:17:05,395 --> 01:17:09,394
Yes, you fought in the glorious
battle of Singapore.

1295
01:17:09,555 --> 01:17:12,954
- The Nips surprised us.
- Yeah?

1296
01:17:13,115 --> 01:17:15,234
Our heavy artillery
was pointed seaward

1297
01:17:15,395 --> 01:17:18,195
and they came up behind us
through the jungle.

1298
01:17:18,356 --> 01:17:22,515
And we surrendered to a force
a third the size of ours...

1299
01:17:22,676 --> 01:17:25,235
the most disgraceful defeat
in British history.

1300
01:17:25,396 --> 01:17:27,115
And Phillip was a part of it.

1301
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:28,996
It was a botched business,
I admit.

1302
01:17:29,156 --> 01:17:31,955
Yes, well, coward Percival

1303
01:17:32,116 --> 01:17:34,354
should have been
court-marshaled, short.

1304
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:36,636
General Percival was a brave
and honorable man.

1305
01:17:36,797 --> 01:17:38,437
The situation was hopeless.

1306
01:17:38,598 --> 01:17:41,636
The fact is, Phillip,
you spent the war as a prisoner,

1307
01:17:41,797 --> 01:17:43,956
as a mere slave of the Japs,

1308
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:45,637
not as a soldier.

1309
01:17:45,798 --> 01:17:48,517
But I survived
when a great many of us didn't.

1310
01:17:48,678 --> 01:17:51,397
I think I should receive
some credit for that.

1311
01:17:51,558 --> 01:17:54,677
Kingsley: Oh, the will to live
is very powerful

1312
01:17:54,838 --> 01:17:57,117
even among
the lower animals, insects...

1313
01:17:57,278 --> 01:17:58,998
mere instinct.

1314
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:01,117
I surrendered because
I was ordered to surrender.

1315
01:18:01,278 --> 01:18:03,358
You didn't have to surrender!

1316
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,718
You could have
gone off into the jungle

1317
01:18:04,879 --> 01:18:06,037
and fought as a guerilla.

1318
01:18:06,199 --> 01:18:09,477
You haven't the faintest bloody
idea what you're talking about!

1319
01:18:11,558 --> 01:18:13,279
Yeah.

1320
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,279
I am astonished.

1321
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:21,560
What makes you think that you
can speak to me in this fashion?

1322
01:18:21,721 --> 01:18:24,439
What makes you think you can sit
there and spout drunken nonsense

1323
01:18:24,601 --> 01:18:25,959
and not be called upon it?

1324
01:18:26,121 --> 01:18:28,279
Well, face the truth, Phillip.

1325
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,600
You're lazy
and you drift through life

1326
01:18:30,761 --> 01:18:32,560
and then you blame
everything on the war.

1327
01:18:32,721 --> 01:18:34,360
You're insane.

1328
01:18:34,521 --> 01:18:36,360
I've never blamed the war
for anything.

1329
01:18:36,521 --> 01:18:38,480
Kingsley: You really do live
in a fantasy land.

1330
01:18:38,641 --> 01:18:41,121
Fantasy?

1331
01:18:41,281 --> 01:18:43,800
You are a pompous old dinosaur
that's outlived his time.

1332
01:18:43,962 --> 01:18:46,240
I think those Japanese guards

1333
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:49,241
kicked you too many times
in the head.

1334
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:54,962
I really must apologize.

1335
01:18:55,123 --> 01:18:59,083
I have behaved very poorly.

1336
01:18:59,244 --> 01:19:00,563
Don't worry about it.

1337
01:19:00,724 --> 01:19:03,962
I have busted a few glasses
in my day.

1338
01:19:06,003 --> 01:19:07,003
Jim: Yeah.

1339
01:19:10,484 --> 01:19:12,923
Whatever happened
to stiff upper lip?

1340
01:19:13,884 --> 01:19:16,924
Yeah.

1341
01:20:08,528 --> 01:20:10,848
What are you doing, Skip?

1342
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:13,288
I came to see you.

1343
01:20:14,529 --> 01:20:17,408
Just go put a shirt on, get you
some ice cream or something

1344
01:20:17,568 --> 01:20:20,168
and go to bed.

1345
01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:24,368
Yeah.

1346
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,969
You remember me being a kid?

1347
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:33,689
Well, hell yes, you was good
one time, so I remember.

1348
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:35,769
Yeah.

1349
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:39,610
You remember when I was
a little bitty kid?

1350
01:20:39,771 --> 01:20:41,930
I just said, yes, I do.

1351
01:20:42,091 --> 01:20:44,410
Now you're my damn kid

1352
01:20:44,571 --> 01:20:47,011
but, God damn it, I'm going
through some business papers.

1353
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:49,451
Just get you an ice cream now.

1354
01:20:49,612 --> 01:20:50,811
Go to bed.

1355
01:20:56,932 --> 01:20:59,771
You remember any stories
about me when I was little?

1356
01:21:01,772 --> 01:21:04,210
You remember anything,
like one time when you and me

1357
01:21:04,372 --> 01:21:07,172
had a conversation sometime,
something like that?

1358
01:21:11,052 --> 01:21:14,932
Anything?
I mean, just some story

1359
01:21:15,093 --> 01:21:18,052
about me when I was
a little kid, you know?

1360
01:21:18,214 --> 01:21:20,693
'Cause, you know,

1361
01:21:20,854 --> 01:21:24,014
Mama told me one or two
last time I saw her.

1362
01:21:24,175 --> 01:21:26,413
What did she tell you?

1363
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:36,414
Well...

1364
01:21:38,374 --> 01:21:40,133
she told me one
about a cousin of hers

1365
01:21:40,294 --> 01:21:42,334
that was so wild,
they used to tie him to a tree

1366
01:21:42,495 --> 01:21:44,734
while they fed the chickens
and put the wash up.

1367
01:21:46,535 --> 01:21:47,614
Jim: Mm-hmm.

1368
01:21:47,775 --> 01:21:49,934
They called him Precious.

1369
01:21:50,095 --> 01:21:52,855
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1370
01:21:53,016 --> 01:21:55,535
The power's back up.

1371
01:21:57,416 --> 01:21:59,296
Put your shirt on.

1372
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:01,097
Go find something to do.

1373
01:22:02,537 --> 01:22:04,136
Yeah.

1374
01:22:05,217 --> 01:22:06,816
All right.

1375
01:22:24,338 --> 01:22:26,257
Turn that music down!

1376
01:23:24,663 --> 01:23:26,382

1386
01:24:33,907 --> 01:24:36,787
Yeah.

1387
01:24:42,388 --> 01:24:44,708
Donna: What are you
thinking about?

1388
01:24:44,869 --> 01:24:47,308
Phillip: I'm not sure.

1389
01:24:47,469 --> 01:24:49,468
Well, there's no way
it wasn't gonna happen.

1390
01:24:49,629 --> 01:24:52,427
Doesn't it feel good to live?

1391
01:24:54,949 --> 01:24:57,988
Yes. Yes, it feels good to live.

1392
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:00,309
Well, you don't seem
too happy about it.

1393
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,030
Don't get all English
on me again.

1394
01:25:03,191 --> 01:25:05,550
I mean, you can't tell me
that wasn't good.

1395
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:08,509
No. No, I can't tell you that.

1396
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,031
Quit being so weird.

1397
01:25:13,591 --> 01:25:15,990
You are thinking something bad,
aren't you?

1398
01:25:17,671 --> 01:25:19,270
It's not fair to be acting
so weird

1399
01:25:19,431 --> 01:25:21,071
and not tell me what it is.

1400
01:25:22,871 --> 01:25:24,790
Talk to me.

1401
01:25:26,552 --> 01:25:28,630
I'm just tired, just very tired.

1402
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:31,391
Don't make excuses.

1403
01:25:31,552 --> 01:25:33,911
Tell me.

1404
01:25:37,712 --> 01:25:39,713
Okay.

1405
01:25:39,873 --> 01:25:43,752
Those things my father was
saying about me, about the war...

1406
01:25:43,913 --> 01:25:46,712
I was a prisoner, a slave,
but I was still a soldier.

1407
01:25:46,873 --> 01:25:50,353
God.

1408
01:25:50,514 --> 01:25:53,872
That's what you were
thinking about?

1409
01:25:54,033 --> 01:25:57,153
Not about me
or about just now...

1410
01:25:57,314 --> 01:25:59,953
you know, about us?

1411
01:26:01,274 --> 01:26:03,193
You wanted to know.

1412
01:26:03,354 --> 01:26:05,073
Well, the war's over.

1413
01:26:05,234 --> 01:26:06,274
And daddies are daddies.

1414
01:26:06,435 --> 01:26:07,993
They're always yelling
and saying shit.

1415
01:26:08,154 --> 01:26:11,514
I don't want you to think about
anything else tonight but me.

1416
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:18,075
I'm sorry, but you insisted.

1417
01:26:20,196 --> 01:26:21,835
No way you could
really understand anyway,

1418
01:26:21,996 --> 01:26:22,955
there's really not.

1419
01:26:23,116 --> 01:26:25,275
Hey,

1420
01:26:25,436 --> 01:26:27,755
don't treat me like that.

1421
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:30,156
I'm not some idiot.

1422
01:26:33,877 --> 01:26:36,676
Did you really spend
the whole war as a prisoner?

1423
01:26:36,837 --> 01:26:40,235
You didn't ever fight?

1424
01:26:40,397 --> 01:26:42,677
It depends on what you mean
by fighting.

1425
01:26:44,438 --> 01:26:46,876
Fighting the enemy, shooting,

1426
01:26:47,038 --> 01:26:49,477
jumping from foxhole to
foxhole...

1427
01:26:49,638 --> 01:26:51,518
not too much.

1428
01:26:53,118 --> 01:26:55,758
Fighting to survive
every crawling,

1429
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:59,037
filthy, miserable,
horror-filled minute...

1430
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:01,559
yes. Yes, I fought.

1431
01:27:13,839 --> 01:27:16,198
Where are you going?

1432
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,000
I just want a cigarette.

1433
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:30,681
The storm didn't last long.

1434
01:27:32,521 --> 01:27:34,440
They never do.

1435
01:27:36,443 --> 01:27:39,441
Probably way off
in the next county by now.

1436
01:28:00,523 --> 01:28:01,762
Camilla:
My father's a monster.

1437
01:28:01,924 --> 01:28:04,203
Skip: Yeah,
Daddy's a monster too.

1438
01:28:05,444 --> 01:28:07,964
- Skip: You watch much TV?
-  No.

1439
01:28:18,485 --> 01:28:21,004
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey.

1440
01:28:21,164 --> 01:28:23,325
I heard you and Kingsley
are going hunting.

1441
01:28:23,486 --> 01:28:24,484
Yeah.

1442
01:28:24,645 --> 01:28:27,244
We're gonna go out...
out around Ten Mile Creek.

1443
01:28:27,405 --> 01:28:29,204
But it ain't hunting season.

1444
01:28:29,365 --> 01:28:31,525
In my places

1445
01:28:31,686 --> 01:28:33,765
it's always hunting season.

1446
01:28:36,165 --> 01:28:38,084
I'm proud of you.

1447
01:28:39,566 --> 01:28:41,766
How come? Wha...?

1448
01:28:41,927 --> 01:28:44,086
Because of how nice
you've been to Kingsley.

1449
01:28:44,247 --> 01:28:46,726
Yeah, well,

1450
01:28:46,887 --> 01:28:49,087
I hated that man for 20 years,

1451
01:28:49,248 --> 01:28:51,407
blamed him for ruining my life.

1452
01:28:51,568 --> 01:28:53,487
Yeah.

1453
01:28:54,527 --> 01:28:56,766
- What changed?
- Well...

1454
01:28:58,408 --> 01:29:00,127
it started at the funeral home
when they rolled him out

1455
01:29:00,288 --> 01:29:01,247
to the ambulance.

1456
01:29:01,408 --> 01:29:03,207
I looked at him
on that stretcher...

1457
01:29:03,368 --> 01:29:05,727
a strange town,
a long way from home,

1458
01:29:05,887 --> 01:29:09,087
just... his wife just died,

1459
01:29:09,249 --> 01:29:11,647
he's thinking maybe
he's fixing to die too...

1460
01:29:11,808 --> 01:29:14,607
and I just thought, "Well..."

1461
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:17,249
"...that poor devil."

1462
01:29:17,409 --> 01:29:20,249
it was like
I wasn't mad no more.

1463
01:29:47,771 --> 01:29:49,650
What is that?

1464
01:29:49,811 --> 01:29:51,850
Ice tea, hon.

1465
01:29:54,292 --> 01:29:56,931
I made some for your grandpa.

1466
01:29:57,092 --> 01:29:59,691
He and Sir Kingsley
are going hunting.

1467
01:29:59,852 --> 01:30:03,012
Made some hot tea
for Sir Kingsley.

1468
01:30:03,173 --> 01:30:05,332
Want a sip of tea? Eh?

1469
01:30:05,493 --> 01:30:07,292
Not yet. Not yet.

1470
01:30:07,453 --> 01:30:09,372
I'm thirsty.

1471
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:17,572
There was a Civil War battle
fought not far from here,

1472
01:30:17,734 --> 01:30:20,653
called the Battle of Ten Mile
Creek.

1473
01:30:20,814 --> 01:30:22,613
- Really?
- Yeah.

1474
01:30:22,774 --> 01:30:25,012
See, the Yankees

1475
01:30:25,173 --> 01:30:28,373
come swooping down
off the high ground,

1476
01:30:28,534 --> 01:30:31,015
killed just about all our boys.

1477
01:30:32,935 --> 01:30:34,854
You haven't brought
your dogs with you.

1478
01:30:35,015 --> 01:30:38,094
No. We don't need any dogs.

1479
01:30:39,816 --> 01:30:41,255
- Daddy.
- What, Mickey?

1480
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:42,695
I'm trying to meditate.

1481
01:30:42,855 --> 01:30:45,094
That was Alan. He's been
tripping since last night

1482
01:30:45,256 --> 01:30:47,575
and this morning put some
in Grandpa's ice tea.

1483
01:30:49,616 --> 01:30:51,255
Why would he do that?

1484
01:30:51,416 --> 01:30:53,735
'Cause I told him.
I said it'd be a good idea.

1485
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:57,655
Fucking dude.

1486
01:31:01,057 --> 01:31:05,095
Actually I've got a very funny
hunting story

1487
01:31:05,256 --> 01:31:06,857
about Phillip
when he was a small...

1488
01:31:07,018 --> 01:31:09,137
Hold on, hold on.
Hold on.

1489
01:31:09,298 --> 01:31:11,257
- Sorry? Beg your pardon?
- Hold on. What's...?

1490
01:31:11,418 --> 01:31:14,217
What's happening?
What's happening?

1491
01:31:14,378 --> 01:31:16,617
Kingsley:
How do you mean?

1492
01:31:23,338 --> 01:31:24,698
Yeah.

1493
01:31:26,139 --> 01:31:28,298
Everything feels funny.

1494
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:33,019
A little wiggly.

1495
01:31:33,179 --> 01:31:35,698
Do you feel a little wiggly?

1496
01:31:37,579 --> 01:31:39,858
Jim, are you all right?

1497
01:31:40,019 --> 01:31:42,059
Everything's changing...

1498
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:44,380
the ground,

1499
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:47,300
the trees, the sky.

1500
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:53,340
The leaves

1501
01:31:53,501 --> 01:31:54,860
like a wave.

1502
01:31:55,021 --> 01:31:57,140
And...

1503
01:31:57,301 --> 01:31:59,900
I don't have any balance.
I don't have any balance.

1504
01:32:01,222 --> 01:32:03,021
Please tell me

1505
01:32:03,182 --> 01:32:05,381
that you see
that parade of trees,

1506
01:32:05,542 --> 01:32:07,981
the one with waving leaves
up yonder, see?

1507
01:32:09,262 --> 01:32:11,661
'Cause I don't know what...
I don't know what's going on

1508
01:32:11,822 --> 01:32:12,901
or where I'm at.

1509
01:32:13,062 --> 01:32:15,661
Look, look, we've got to get you
back home.

1510
01:32:15,822 --> 01:32:17,181
Yeah.

1511
01:32:17,341 --> 01:32:18,542
No, no, no, don't.

1512
01:32:18,703 --> 01:32:21,423
Whew.

1513
01:32:21,584 --> 01:32:24,542
Look, we've got to get you home.

1514
01:32:24,703 --> 01:32:26,942
- Let me help you up.
- No, no.

1515
01:32:27,103 --> 01:32:29,023
- You can kiss my ass.
- Eh?

1516
01:32:29,184 --> 01:32:31,263
You'll have to kill me first.

1517
01:32:31,424 --> 01:32:33,503
Yeah? How did you get behind...
behind our lines?

1518
01:32:33,663 --> 01:32:35,383
I got a whole company of men
right behind that curtain

1519
01:32:35,544 --> 01:32:38,063
over there, you sorry
sack of Hun shit.

1520
01:32:38,224 --> 01:32:40,023
Drop that weapon!

1521
01:32:40,184 --> 01:32:43,183
Jim, have you... have you
gone completely mad?

1522
01:32:43,344 --> 01:32:44,543
- Jim: Yeah.
- What?

1523
01:32:44,704 --> 01:32:47,264
I'm not a German, Jim.

1524
01:32:47,425 --> 01:32:49,583
It's Kingsley.

1525
01:32:49,744 --> 01:32:52,623
German Jim Kingsley...
good alias.

1526
01:32:52,784 --> 01:32:55,224
Is that how you got back here,
Mr. Alias?

1527
01:32:55,385 --> 01:32:57,465
Let me see your orders now.

1528
01:32:57,626 --> 01:32:59,265
Your orders.

1529
01:32:59,426 --> 01:33:02,825
Who won the 1916 World Series?

1530
01:33:02,986 --> 01:33:05,426
I haven't the faintest idea.

1531
01:33:05,587 --> 01:33:07,585
Boston Red Sox in six.

1532
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:11,825
Ja, ja!

1533
01:33:14,668 --> 01:33:16,866
All right, all right. All right.

1534
01:33:17,027 --> 01:33:20,266
- Yeah.
- Jim, calm down. Calm down.

1535
01:33:20,427 --> 01:33:22,827
Who do you think you's fooling,
you cabbage head?

1536
01:33:24,467 --> 01:33:26,266
Open your mouth.

1537
01:33:26,428 --> 01:33:29,146
No, I'm... I'm English.

1538
01:33:29,307 --> 01:33:31,107
We fought on the same side.

1539
01:33:31,268 --> 01:33:33,348
But it's not the Great War now.
It's 1969.

1540
01:33:33,509 --> 01:33:37,828
So please, please,
please put the gun down.

1541
01:33:45,749 --> 01:33:46,788
Oh my God.

1542
01:33:46,949 --> 01:33:49,268
Kingsley: Heavens.

1543
01:33:50,349 --> 01:33:53,628
Jim!

1544
01:33:53,789 --> 01:33:55,268
Where's Daddy?
Is he back yet?

1545
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:56,388
He's hunting
with the old man Bedford.

1546
01:33:56,549 --> 01:33:57,589
What's going on?

1547
01:33:57,749 --> 01:33:59,510
Alan put LSD
in Daddy's ice tea.

1548
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:02,429
- He fucking what?
- Donna: Where did Alan get LSD?

1549
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:04,389
Did he say
where he was going?

1550
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:06,109
Yeah, they're out
along Ten Mile Creek.

1551
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,749
Okay, come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

1552
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:09,911
- Get your truck.
- Lord have mercy.

1553
01:34:15,071 --> 01:34:20,511
Jim!

1554
01:34:37,193 --> 01:34:38,912
Daddy!

1555
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:40,232
Hey, Daddy!

1556
01:34:40,392 --> 01:34:43,031
Daddy! Hey, Daddy!

1557
01:34:43,193 --> 01:34:45,752
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

1558
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:47,593
- Daddy!
- Carroll: Hey, Daddy!

1559
01:34:47,754 --> 01:34:49,593
- Father!
- Daddy!

1560
01:34:49,754 --> 01:34:52,513
Y'all, shut up.
It ain't kindergarten.

1561
01:34:54,555 --> 01:34:56,313
Daddy!

1562
01:34:58,195 --> 01:35:00,313
All right, Carroll,
you go this way.

1563
01:35:00,474 --> 01:35:02,274
You go that way.

1564
01:35:02,436 --> 01:35:04,354
Carroll: Daddy!

1565
01:35:05,555 --> 01:35:07,874
Donna, you get your ass
over here.

1566
01:35:08,835 --> 01:35:10,594
- Beautiful!
- Kingsley: Jim.

1567
01:35:10,755 --> 01:35:12,755
I never knew it was so
beautiful.

1568
01:35:12,915 --> 01:35:14,235
God, it's so beautiful.

1569
01:35:14,396 --> 01:35:15,834
We really have to return
to the truck.

1570
01:35:17,956 --> 01:35:19,754
Phillip: Father!

1571
01:35:19,915 --> 01:35:20,955
Phillip!

1572
01:35:21,117 --> 01:35:23,116
- I found him!
- Jimbo: Looky here.

1573
01:35:23,277 --> 01:35:25,116
Hey! Come on!

1574
01:35:25,277 --> 01:35:27,076
Come on, Kingsley.

1575
01:35:27,237 --> 01:35:28,796
Jim: Get your skinny
little ass in here!

1576
01:35:28,956 --> 01:35:31,836
- Thank God. Are you all right?
- Yes, yes, I'm all right.

1577
01:35:31,997 --> 01:35:34,397
Poor Jim has completely
lost his mind.

1578
01:35:34,558 --> 01:35:35,676
Jim:
Uh-oh, here comes the police.

1579
01:35:35,837 --> 01:35:36,796
What are y'all looking at?

1580
01:35:36,957 --> 01:35:38,477
Phillip: What on earth
happened?

1581
01:35:38,638 --> 01:35:39,797
Kingsley:
I've been worried about Jim

1582
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:40,917
for the last hour and a half.

1583
01:35:41,078 --> 01:35:43,037
Jim: Come on in.

1584
01:35:46,278 --> 01:35:48,477
I love it. I love it.

1585
01:35:53,918 --> 01:35:56,637
Jimbo: You got a 70-some-odd
year old man out there!

1586
01:35:56,799 --> 01:35:58,717
He could have hurt himself!

1587
01:35:58,879 --> 01:36:00,719
Alan: I didn't know
he was gonna be going hunting.

1588
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,239
Jimbo: Son, he's out there
running around the woods

1589
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,359
with a gun!

1590
01:36:03,519 --> 01:36:05,279
He could have killed
that goddamn Englishman!

1591
01:36:05,439 --> 01:36:07,159
Alan: Yeah, but he didn't, Dad.
It's okay. God.

1592
01:36:07,321 --> 01:36:08,919
Jimbo: Boy, it ain't about
what he didn't do!

1593
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:10,439
It's about
what it could have been!

1594
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,599
Kingsley: Oh, well.

1595
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,478
Jimbo: What the hell
has gotten into you?

1596
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:17,239
I raised you
better than this, boy.

1597
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,360
Did you think of me?
Did you think of your mama?

1598
01:36:19,521 --> 01:36:21,040
What do you think
your mama's gonna think of this?

1599
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,159
How is he?

1600
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,279
Alan:
Exactly what I was thinking.

1601
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,080
- About the same.
- ...you had to live with you.

1602
01:36:25,241 --> 01:36:26,800
According to Carroll,
it could take a long time

1603
01:36:26,961 --> 01:36:27,920
for the drug to wear off.

1604
01:36:28,081 --> 01:36:30,720
Alan: You don't ever care
about nobody but what you want.

1605
01:36:30,881 --> 01:36:32,640
Jimbo: Son, I'm gonna
tell you right now,

1606
01:36:32,801 --> 01:36:33,921
I would never do that
to my father!

1607
01:36:34,082 --> 01:36:35,041
I'm glad you're safe though,
Father.

1608
01:36:35,201 --> 01:36:36,440
Jimbo: I would never do that
to my father!

1609
01:36:36,601 --> 01:36:37,561
I was worried about you.

1610
01:36:37,722 --> 01:36:38,882
Jimbo:
How the hell could you do that?

1611
01:36:39,042 --> 01:36:41,521
Nothing to worry about.
I've been in tighter spots.

1612
01:36:41,682 --> 01:36:44,202
Jimbo: You're disrespecting me
right now!

1613
01:36:44,363 --> 01:36:45,682
You're gonna be
grounded forever!

1614
01:36:45,843 --> 01:36:46,922
- You understand?
- Phillip...

1615
01:36:47,083 --> 01:36:49,601
- Alan: You can't ground me.
- Jimbo: I sure as shit can!

1616
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:51,682
- Last night I...
- Alan: I'll just run away!

1617
01:36:51,843 --> 01:36:54,442
I think I said some things
I didn't really mean.

1618
01:36:54,603 --> 01:36:56,522
- I didn't either, Father.
- Alan: You ain't gonna hit me!

1619
01:36:56,683 --> 01:36:57,682
Alan: You ain't gonna hit me!

1620
01:36:57,843 --> 01:36:59,762
Jimbo: You ain't too big
to spank, you understand me?

1621
01:36:59,923 --> 01:37:00,923
Alan: I'm going away
to Carroll's.

1622
01:37:01,084 --> 01:37:03,843
Let's just put it behind us
and go on.

1623
01:37:04,003 --> 01:37:05,443
Jimbo: You get your ass up
to that room.

1624
01:37:05,604 --> 01:37:06,563
Get your ass up to that...

1625
01:37:06,724 --> 01:37:07,683
Alan: You can't tell me
what to do!

1626
01:37:07,843 --> 01:37:09,402
- Kingsley: Oh, yes.
- Jimbo: I sure as shit can.

1627
01:37:09,565 --> 01:37:10,684
As long as you're
in this house...

1628
01:37:10,845 --> 01:37:12,563
- Go on.
- ...you're mine!

1629
01:37:12,724 --> 01:37:13,924
Alan: Well, I hate this house!

1630
01:37:14,085 --> 01:37:15,484
And I fucking hate you!

1631
01:37:15,645 --> 01:37:18,164
Jimbo: Better don't come out
till I tell you to come out!

1632
01:37:18,325 --> 01:37:20,805
My billfold got wet in the
creek.

1633
01:37:20,966 --> 01:37:23,845
Take all the stuff out,
spread it all out and dry it.

1634
01:37:24,006 --> 01:37:25,605
- Okay?
- Okay.

1635
01:37:25,766 --> 01:37:27,204
- See?
- Where is it?

1636
01:37:27,365 --> 01:37:29,325
It were in there.

1637
01:37:29,487 --> 01:37:33,045
Yeah. Just dry everything...

1638
01:37:33,205 --> 01:37:35,605
my license and whatnot...

1639
01:37:37,287 --> 01:37:39,965
and that damn letter of yours.

1640
01:38:03,528 --> 01:38:06,127
- I don't understand.
- What?

1641
01:38:06,289 --> 01:38:09,007
All these years you've been
carrying this around.

1642
01:38:09,168 --> 01:38:11,448
Why not say
it meant something to you?

1643
01:38:15,369 --> 01:38:18,568
it's not gonna kill you
to talk to your kids, Pops.

1644
01:38:20,289 --> 01:38:22,569
You might be surprised
what happens.

1645
01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:26,089
What's the matter
with your head?

1646
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:28,610
Huh?

1647
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,410
I can't!

1648
01:38:41,572 --> 01:38:44,051
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1649
01:38:44,212 --> 01:38:46,090
- Daddy, Daddy.
- I can't breathe.

1650
01:38:46,251 --> 01:38:47,251
Daddy, it's Jimbo.
I'm right here.

1651
01:38:47,411 --> 01:38:49,451
- I can't breathe.
- I'm right here.

1652
01:38:49,612 --> 01:38:50,571
Let's get you up.
Come on.

1653
01:38:50,732 --> 01:38:51,691
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1654
01:38:51,852 --> 01:38:53,451
Skip, don't just stand there.

1655
01:38:53,612 --> 01:38:55,211
- It's swelling me up!
- Get over here and help me.

1656
01:38:55,371 --> 01:38:56,330
- I can't breathe!
- Let's take him outside.

1657
01:38:56,492 --> 01:38:59,292
Come on.

1658
01:38:59,453 --> 01:39:01,571
It's pretty to look at,
but it ain't good fire though!

1659
01:39:01,732 --> 01:39:04,012
I can't breathe!
Motherfucker!

1660
01:39:04,173 --> 01:39:07,013
I can't breathe! Hey!
I can't breathe!

1661
01:39:07,173 --> 01:39:08,613
- Come on, Daddy.
- I can't breathe!

1662
01:39:08,774 --> 01:39:11,573
- Come on.
- No! I can't! I can't breathe!

1663
01:39:11,734 --> 01:39:13,173
- Come on.
- I can't breathe!

1664
01:39:22,254 --> 01:39:24,053
Watch that step, Daddy.

1665
01:39:31,574 --> 01:39:33,894
- You steady him, Skip.
- What's that?

1666
01:39:34,054 --> 01:39:36,014
I'm gonna go make
some more coffee.

1667
01:39:36,175 --> 01:39:37,455
All right.

1668
01:39:37,615 --> 01:39:39,414
Did you need me
to hold you up, Daddy?

1669
01:39:39,575 --> 01:39:41,735
Uh, hold yourself up.

1670
01:39:41,896 --> 01:39:44,054
Skip.

1671
01:39:44,216 --> 01:39:46,935
Yeah. Yeah.

1672
01:39:49,136 --> 01:39:51,535
You know, there was a...

1673
01:39:51,697 --> 01:39:54,496
there was a time

1674
01:39:54,657 --> 01:39:56,456
when everybody I looked at

1675
01:39:56,617 --> 01:39:59,695
looked like pigs

1676
01:39:59,857 --> 01:40:01,615
with hollowed out eyes.

1677
01:40:01,776 --> 01:40:04,656
And everything
was kind of yellow.

1678
01:40:04,817 --> 01:40:06,976
Yeah.

1679
01:40:07,137 --> 01:40:09,016
Is that when you was
in the war?

1680
01:40:09,177 --> 01:40:10,976
No, about 10 minutes ago,

1681
01:40:11,137 --> 01:40:13,977
or maybe it was yesterday.

1682
01:40:15,378 --> 01:40:16,856
I'll be darned.

1683
01:40:17,018 --> 01:40:19,698
Yeah. Yeah.

1684
01:40:19,858 --> 01:40:22,019
Hey,

1685
01:40:22,179 --> 01:40:23,539
you see down there

1686
01:40:23,699 --> 01:40:25,938
where that fence goes along
with the driveway,

1687
01:40:26,099 --> 01:40:28,378
looks like a big rubber band,

1688
01:40:28,539 --> 01:40:31,339
you know? Huh?

1689
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,659
No, sir. I can hardly see
anything out there,

1690
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,258
to tell you the truth.

1691
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:37,219
Well, I was putting barbed wire
up along there.

1692
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:38,339
You must have been
about seven or eight.

1693
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:40,059
And I had you helping me.

1694
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:42,219
And I got all tangled up.
I ended up falling,

1695
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:46,539
getting all rolled up in it.

1696
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:50,420
And it was all stuck
in my hair even,

1697
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:53,619
my shirt and my pants.

1698
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:56,140
And I asked you to help me
get out of it.

1699
01:40:56,302 --> 01:40:58,741
And you started bawling
and run off.

1700
01:40:58,902 --> 01:41:00,701
I said, "Why, you little shit."

1701
01:41:03,142 --> 01:41:05,540
And in a minute or two
you come back just hauling ass,

1702
01:41:05,702 --> 01:41:08,541
still crying,
with a pair of wire cutters.

1703
01:41:08,702 --> 01:41:12,141
I said, "God damn, Skip, I done
got wire cutters right here.

1704
01:41:12,302 --> 01:41:15,262
I just need you to help me
get out of this."

1705
01:41:15,423 --> 01:41:18,062
You...

1706
01:41:18,223 --> 01:41:20,262
you always...

1707
01:41:20,423 --> 01:41:23,022
you always panicked
when somebody got hurt.

1708
01:41:23,183 --> 01:41:27,183
You never could see anything
get hurt, you never did.

1709
01:41:27,343 --> 01:41:29,622
Yeah.

1710
01:41:32,344 --> 01:41:34,144
You said I was about
seven or eight?

1711
01:41:34,305 --> 01:41:35,624
Yeah.

1712
01:41:35,785 --> 01:41:37,584
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

1713
01:41:37,745 --> 01:41:39,784
What are you doing?

1714
01:41:39,944 --> 01:41:42,505
I was just kind of putting
my arm around you a little.

1715
01:41:42,666 --> 01:41:45,024
Well,

1716
01:41:45,185 --> 01:41:47,384
huh.

1717
01:41:47,545 --> 01:41:49,784
Feels strange.

1718
01:41:52,585 --> 01:41:54,384
- Yeah.
- All right.

1719
01:41:54,546 --> 01:41:58,425
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1720
01:41:58,586 --> 01:42:00,304
Are you wet?

1721
01:42:00,465 --> 01:42:02,265
- Wet?
- Yeah.

1722
01:42:02,427 --> 01:42:04,585
No, sir. I'm...

1723
01:42:04,746 --> 01:42:06,425
Do you feel wet?

1724
01:42:17,228 --> 01:42:18,907
Jimbo: if we was
Old West outlaws...

1725
01:42:19,068 --> 01:42:20,947
I was thinking about this
the other day...

1726
01:42:21,108 --> 01:42:24,147
I'd be Jesse James,

1727
01:42:24,308 --> 01:42:26,547
Carroll would be Pat Garrett...

1728
01:42:28,989 --> 01:42:31,107
Skip, you'd be Billy the Kid.

1729
01:42:32,068 --> 01:42:33,947
Carroll:
Pat Garrett wasn't an outlaw.

1730
01:42:34,109 --> 01:42:35,387
Jimbo: Yeah, he was.

1731
01:42:35,548 --> 01:42:37,547
He changed his mind
and he switched over.

1732
01:42:37,709 --> 01:42:39,508
How come I'd have to be
Billy the Kid?

1733
01:42:39,669 --> 01:42:40,948
Jimbo: 'Cause.

1734
01:42:45,229 --> 01:42:48,469
Because he was just a dumb-ass
who got lucky and killed a few.

1735
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:53,509
There's this one picture of him.

1736
01:42:53,670 --> 01:42:55,590
I saw it.

1737
01:42:58,351 --> 01:42:59,350
He's lopsided.

1738
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:01,469
Looks like he's licking the snot
off his nose.

1739
01:43:04,231 --> 01:43:06,270
What if I throw a low, hard one
down there,

1740
01:43:06,431 --> 01:43:08,430
bounce it up in your nuts?
How would you like that?

1741
01:43:08,591 --> 01:43:10,270
Jimbo: I don't think
I'd like that too much.

1742
01:43:10,431 --> 01:43:12,949
I was just kidding.
I'm just fucking with you.

1743
01:43:15,112 --> 01:43:16,110
Shit.

1744
01:43:16,271 --> 01:43:18,271
Carroll:
Hey, can we take a break?

1745
01:43:18,431 --> 01:43:20,031
'Cause I'm tired
of just standing here.

1746
01:43:20,192 --> 01:43:22,872
I don't know about you.

1747
01:43:23,033 --> 01:43:24,832
Hey.

1748
01:43:24,993 --> 01:43:26,112
- What?
- Hey.

1749
01:43:26,273 --> 01:43:28,832
Oh. One of the dogs has been
shitting on the porch.

1750
01:43:28,992 --> 01:43:31,112
I think it's this
damn Penelope.

1751
01:43:31,273 --> 01:43:32,913
Where did everybody go?

1752
01:43:33,074 --> 01:43:36,353
Well, Jimbo's out back
someplace there.

1753
01:43:36,514 --> 01:43:38,592
No, I mean,

1754
01:43:38,753 --> 01:43:40,512
where's the Bedfords?

1755
01:43:40,674 --> 01:43:43,392
Well, they left already
about an hour ago. Yeah.

1756
01:43:43,554 --> 01:43:45,433
- They left?
- Yeah.

1757
01:43:45,593 --> 01:43:47,632
Well, why didn't anybody
wake me up?

1758
01:43:47,793 --> 01:43:50,153
I reckon nobody
thought about it.

1759
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:53,794
Good girl.

1760
01:43:53,954 --> 01:43:56,353
Well, what did they say?

1761
01:43:56,514 --> 01:43:58,514
They said, "Bye.
We had a good time,"

1762
01:43:58,675 --> 01:44:00,875
you know, stuff like that.

1763
01:44:01,036 --> 01:44:04,035
Dorothy gave them some chicken
and biscuits to eat on the road.

1764
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:06,275
- Well...
- Good girl.

1765
01:44:06,435 --> 01:44:09,475
Did anybody say,
"Tell Donna goodbye"

1766
01:44:09,636 --> 01:44:13,155
- or something?
- Not that I remember, no.

1767
01:44:15,716 --> 01:44:17,036
No.

1768
01:44:17,197 --> 01:44:19,116
Well...

1769
01:44:21,436 --> 01:44:23,635
You're a good girl
most of the time.

1770
01:44:23,796 --> 01:44:25,995
Don't shit over there now.

1771
01:44:26,157 --> 01:44:30,436
Uh, I'd better see

1772
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:33,476
what Jimbo's up to.

1773
01:44:33,637 --> 01:44:35,397
Okay.

1774
01:44:35,558 --> 01:44:37,477
Jim: Yeah.

1775
01:44:44,839 --> 01:44:47,918
It'll be good to get home, hmm?

1776
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:49,998
Yes, Father.

1777
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:01,958
Well, Skip, you finally got
some decent pussy, didn't you?

1778
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:16,800
Well, maybe
I'm in love with her.

1779
01:45:16,961 --> 01:45:18,680
What do you think of that?

1780
01:45:20,801 --> 01:45:22,601
- What?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

1781
01:45:22,762 --> 01:45:25,320
I'm sorry, that's just funny
for some reason.

1782
01:45:29,281 --> 01:45:30,762
Hey...

1783
01:45:32,882 --> 01:45:35,041
- Nah.
- Shit, man, Daddy did acid.

1784
01:45:35,202 --> 01:45:37,121
- No.
- He said he figured out

1785
01:45:37,282 --> 01:45:39,402
everything he ever
wondered about.

1786
01:45:39,562 --> 01:45:41,562
Then he said that when he puked
he forgot all of it.

1787
01:45:43,442 --> 01:45:45,282
Hey, Jimbo,

1788
01:45:45,443 --> 01:45:48,643
what did you put
in Mama's casket?

1789
01:45:48,804 --> 01:45:50,283
I saw you put something
in there.

1790
01:45:53,604 --> 01:45:56,243
It's just something
between me and her.

1791
01:45:57,404 --> 01:45:59,803
Come on, man, what was it?

1792
01:46:06,605 --> 01:46:09,164
It was a letter I wrote her
and never sent her.

1793
01:46:20,405 --> 01:46:22,284
Boy, this shit's strong.

1794
01:46:25,847 --> 01:46:28,206
What?

1795
01:46:28,367 --> 01:46:31,405
What, you don't think
I never smoked dope before?

1796
01:46:31,566 --> 01:46:33,486
What do you think I am,
a caveman?

1797
01:46:35,407 --> 01:46:37,646
Shit.

1798
01:46:37,807 --> 01:46:40,526
I just don't like it.
It ain't good for me.

1799
01:46:40,687 --> 01:46:43,287
I start thinking
the FBI is chasing after me.

1800
01:46:43,448 --> 01:46:45,246
My heart starts racing so fast,

1801
01:46:45,407 --> 01:46:47,687
I'm worried it's not gonna stop
till I'm dead.

1802
01:46:55,088 --> 01:46:57,127
Hey, Jimbo, me and Carroll...
we don't care

1803
01:46:57,288 --> 01:47:00,047
that you never did see combat,
just so you know.

1804
01:47:00,207 --> 01:47:03,209
We really don't.

1805
01:47:03,369 --> 01:47:06,448
I mean, you're our brother
and we love you to death

1806
01:47:06,609 --> 01:47:09,088
and you're our flesh and blood,
you know.

1807
01:47:09,248 --> 01:47:11,489
And we're glad you didn't.

1808
01:47:14,489 --> 01:47:17,009
There ain't no reason
to be jealous about it.

1809
01:47:18,010 --> 01:47:20,769
You don't have any idea.

1810
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:23,409
So, um...

1811
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:28,490
you ought to be happy

1812
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:30,330
about it.

1813
01:47:32,531 --> 01:47:35,089
I mean, me and Carroll's proud
of what we did and everything,

1814
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:37,690
but it's a goddamn
nightmare, Jimbo.

1815
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:41,291
So you ought to just let it go.

1816
01:47:45,412 --> 01:47:48,491
See, you can work

1817
01:47:48,652 --> 01:47:50,932
and sleep and be thought of
as normal.

1818
01:47:51,092 --> 01:47:53,371
Me and him can't, you know.

1819
01:47:53,533 --> 01:47:56,132
I mean, you see
how Daddy treats us.

1820
01:47:58,293 --> 01:48:00,812
What little sleep I get,

1821
01:48:00,972 --> 01:48:03,092
I wake up

1822
01:48:03,253 --> 01:48:05,492
thinking I'm on fire.

1823
01:48:05,653 --> 01:48:07,572
Now how would you like that?

1824
01:48:26,095 --> 01:48:27,894
God damn, buddy,
I love you to death,

1825
01:48:28,055 --> 01:48:31,054
but sometimes, man, you can
really fuck up a free meal.

1826
01:48:31,215 --> 01:48:32,374
Now what did you have
to say that for?

1827
01:48:32,535 --> 01:48:35,615
I mean, he was actually smoking
with us and talking to us.

1828
01:48:35,776 --> 01:48:37,614
Now why did you have to
say that, man?

1829
01:48:37,775 --> 01:48:39,974
It just felt right.

1830
01:48:50,937 --> 01:48:52,536
Here.

1831
01:48:52,697 --> 01:48:54,936
Put this on your face.

1832
01:49:00,778 --> 01:49:03,376
Now that's why
you'd be Billy the Kid.

1833
01:49:03,538 --> 01:49:05,617
He got shot when he was 21

1834
01:49:05,778 --> 01:49:08,258
for being too big for his
britches and not thinking.

1835
01:49:08,419 --> 01:49:11,578
You just need to think sometimes
before you open your mouth.

1836
01:49:16,858 --> 01:49:18,778
I do think, Jimbo.

1837
01:49:18,939 --> 01:49:20,858
No, you don't.

1838
01:49:23,578 --> 01:49:25,818
I try not to.

1839
01:49:28,619 --> 01:49:30,419
Hey, hey,

1840
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:33,019
let's go get some cheeseburgers

1841
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:36,019
and go hang out at my place.

1842
01:49:38,541 --> 01:49:40,460
Let's go.

1843
01:49:42,301 --> 01:49:44,220
All right.

1844
01:49:46,781 --> 01:49:48,700
Let's go.

1845
01:50:01,181 --> 01:50:02,941
You drive.

1846
01:50:04,822 --> 01:50:06,461
You shitting me?

1847
01:50:06,623 --> 01:50:08,702
No. Go ahead.

1848
01:50:08,863 --> 01:50:10,622
Carroll:
Are you sure, buddy?

1849
01:50:10,783 --> 01:50:12,463
Yeah.

1850
01:50:25,823 --> 01:50:27,462
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1851
01:50:27,623 --> 01:50:29,023
Let's do it.

1852
01:50:32,065 --> 01:50:34,543
Skip: Jimbo, stop. Stop the car.
Stop the car.

1853
01:50:34,704 --> 01:50:37,383
God damn it.
I c... I'm sorry.

1854
01:50:40,185 --> 01:50:42,465
I'm sorry, Jimbo,
it just don't feel right.

1855
01:50:42,626 --> 01:50:44,945
Jimbo:
Well, God damn it, Skip.

1856
01:51:25,469 --> 01:51:27,107
Daddy.

1857
01:51:27,269 --> 01:51:28,708
Hey.

1858
01:51:30,309 --> 01:51:32,227
What's up?

1859
01:51:36,029 --> 01:51:39,429
I went to the recruiting office
yesterday

1860
01:51:39,589 --> 01:51:42,628
when you were over
at Grandpa's

1861
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:44,589
and I joined the army.

1862
01:51:48,949 --> 01:51:51,308
The sergeant said they'll keep
me and Connell together.

1863
01:51:58,311 --> 01:52:00,630
Everybody in the family
did it, Daddy.

1864
01:52:02,312 --> 01:52:04,231
I saw this picture

1865
01:52:04,392 --> 01:52:06,750
of some guys in 'Nam
hanging out

1866
01:52:06,911 --> 01:52:08,430
with some palm trees,
with their shirts off

1867
01:52:08,591 --> 01:52:10,311
and guns slung
over their shoulders.

1868
01:52:13,992 --> 01:52:16,271
Looked so fucking rock 'n' roll.

1869
01:52:18,391 --> 01:52:21,031
I want to do
something cool, Daddy.

1870
01:52:21,192 --> 01:52:23,432
I don't want to rot here.

1871
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:31,632
I'm 18.

1872
01:52:31,793 --> 01:52:34,153
I don't need your permission.
