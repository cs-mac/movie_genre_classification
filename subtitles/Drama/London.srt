1
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,490
Tell me when you're gonna come.

2
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:55,312
-Are you coming? You're coming?
-Yeah.

3
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,204
Hello.

4
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,173
Hey, bro, what's up?

5
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,050
I'm crashed out.

6
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,524
What are you doing?

7
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,628
What party?
What are you talking about?

8
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,160
Are you fucking kidding me?

9
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,829
Are you fucking kidding me?

10
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,805
Where?

11
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,071
Fuck!

12
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,075
Fuck!

13
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,083
The number you have reached has
been disconnected, if you feel you--

14
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:13,055
No fucking way!

15
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,450
Where's the phone? Payphone.

16
00:04:56,628 --> 00:05:00,120
Straight to the back,
past the bathrooms, on the left.

17
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:09,569
Hey, Mallory.

18
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,174
Oh, hey, Syd, what's up?

19
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:24,680
You gonna go
to Becca's thing tonight?

20
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:27,689
Yeah, you know, I was gonna go
and say goodbye.

21
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:30,118
Why, you going?

22
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:33,526
Yeah, I think so.
Thinking about it. Yeah.

23
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,627
So you still talk to London?

24
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:40,703
Yeah, you know,
here and there. Why?

25
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:44,808
Oh, you know, I was just a little
surprised to hear she was moving.

26
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:49,411
Did she get a place out there?
Is she staying with somebody?

27
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:52,481
She didn't tell you where
she was staying? Come on, Mal.

28
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,676
I mean, she said something
about moving in with her boyfriend...

29
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:59,449
...or something, but, I mean,
that's pretty much all I know.

30
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:02,053
-Can I get you a drink?
-Yeah.

31
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:04,593
Can I have a vodka? A large one.

32
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:06,821
Naked, please.

33
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:15,932
Excuse me. One second here.

34
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,375
Here you go.

35
00:06:19,544 --> 00:06:22,945
Thanks. Hey, look, I didn't--
I didn't mean to be rude.

36
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:25,242
It's okay.

37
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:29,786
-Hey, Syd, I gotta go cash out, so....
-Yeah.

38
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,785
-See you tonight.
-Yeah.

39
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:35,915
Listen, I'm gonna get a bit of sniff,
so if you want some, just let me know.

40
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:38,221
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

41
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,727
How much is it?

42
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,559
Oh, no, don't worry. Just find me.

43
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:44,395
Don't tell London.
You know she hates that shit.

44
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:47,037
Yeah, like I'm gonna say something.

45
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:50,663
-All right, well, see you later.
-Yeah, I'll see you.

46
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:04,284
Your name wouldn't happen
to be Bateman, would it?

47
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:08,792
-Unfortunately, yes.
-Hey. Syd.

48
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,053
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming down.

49
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:14,323
I know you don't deliver this far down.
I just had a shitty day.

50
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,558
I have to clear my head out.

51
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:18,395
No worries, mate.

52
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,560
So where do you wanna do this?

53
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,308
We don't want to go in the bathroom.
It's horrendous in there.

54
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,705
I drove. You wanna use my car?

55
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,940
Your car? Why not?

56
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:40,420
So how is this shit? It's pretty good?

57
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:43,356
Can't say I've sampled
any of this batch...

58
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:47,430
...but considering the source,
I imagine it to be pretty clean, yeah.

59
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:53,670
So is this like a full-time gig for you?
A full-time job?

60
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,829
No, mate, I'm a banker.

61
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:58,305
Foreign exchange dealer.
Currency trader.

62
00:07:58,476 --> 00:08:01,877
-Currency trader?
-Euros, pounds, arbitrage, yeah.

63
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,775
Okay, so you're not a dealer.

64
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:06,712
Mate, I ain't a fucking dealer.

65
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:08,876
Strictly a buyer.

66
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,544
I was uptown, you were on my way.
It's just a favor.

67
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:15,988
Gotcha. Well, whatever it is,
I really appreciate it, man.

68
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:22,659
Here we go.

69
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,631
So a currency trader, huh?

70
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:26,793
How's the money in that, good?

71
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:29,337
Not if you get stuck on this shit, no.

72
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,408
Yeah, I know.
God, what a stupid fucking drug.

73
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:37,307
I don't know what you're doing after
this, if you got plans or anything...

74
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:41,145
...but a friend is having a party two
blocks from here, if you're interested.

75
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:43,844
No, thanks, mate,
but I've had a shit day, believe me.

76
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,650
I just figured, you know,
you came down this whole way.

77
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:48,689
It'll probably be pretty good.

78
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,192
What kind of party is it, exactly?

79
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:52,989
Actually, it's a....

80
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:58,693
It's a going-away party for this girl,
for my ex-chick.

81
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,034
But it'll be good, you know,
free booze, free food, hot chicks.

82
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:06,267
I really shouldn't. Thanks anyway.
I appreciate the offer.

83
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:15,412
Fuck it, Syd. I'm gonna go.
Take it easy.

84
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:17,952
Why are you gonna go?
Don't go. You just got here.

85
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:20,215
You walked all the way down here.
Why leave?

86
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,051
Because I've had a horrendous day.

87
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:26,026
I've decided not to go because I don't
want to meet a loft full of strangers.

88
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:28,596
-You enjoy yourself.
-Come in for five minutes.

89
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:30,757
-Get a drink.
-No, man. You go, fuck it.

90
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:32,925
What do you got
that's better than this?

91
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:35,071
Girls, free booze, do a line.

92
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:38,140
I've just come out of the most
psychotic therapy session...

93
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:41,573
...I've had in fucking years.
Almost smacked some cunt for a taxi.

94
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:44,111
I really don't know
if I'm ready for this shit.

95
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,876
Just come in for five minutes.
You don't like it, you can leave.

96
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:49,780
One fucking drink, bro.

97
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:52,080
Mallory will be here.

98
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:53,720
One drink?

99
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:55,722
One fucking drink.

100
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:03,558
-How you doing, man?
-Evening.

101
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,895
-What is it, 501 1?
-Yes.

102
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:07,730
Thanks, man.

103
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:12,333
-Hey, Maya.
-Hi, Syd.

104
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,773
-How you doing?
-Good.

105
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:18,108
-It's been a while.
-Yeah. How you doing?

106
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:20,307
I'm good.
Bateman, this is Maya. Sorry.

107
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:22,475
-Maya, Bateman.
-Nice to meet you.

108
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:24,780
How you been?
What you been up to?

109
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:30,891
In hell, man. I fucked up on the SATs,
I gotta retake them.

110
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:33,988
-That's it, you know?
-Right.

111
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:37,133
Just wanna kill myself. Yeah.

112
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:50,873
Well, you know, if you want to get out
of SAT mode, I picked up a lot of:

113
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:53,949
-You know, so....
-Are you dealing now?

114
00:10:54,117 --> 00:10:58,781
Yes, I'm dealing. No, I'm not dealing.
I got more than I need, so if you're....

115
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:01,117
-All right, man, thanks.
-Just come find me.

116
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,785
-I might take you up on that.
-Did anybody--?

117
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,364
Coming.

118
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:20,332
-Hello.
-Hello.

119
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,171
-Hey, baby.
-How are you?

120
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:25,473
-I'm good. Hey, Syd, how are you?
-This, my darling, is for you.

121
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:28,242
Oh, you guys, shut up. Thank you.

122
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:31,682
-You know you are the best.
-Nobody's here yet.

123
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:33,914
Grab a drink.
Make yourself at home.

124
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,217
Hello? Syd and London.

125
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:39,589
-Don't disrespect them in public.
-ln public.

126
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:41,354
Let's go upstairs.

127
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:44,898
Why? Who's upstairs?

128
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:48,332
Very bad. Catch me.

129
00:12:10,593 --> 00:12:12,788
You're crazy.

130
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:19,228
What is this?

131
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:20,767
It's for you.

132
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:26,008
-For me? For me?
-For you.

133
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,979
Oh, my God, Syd, I love it.

134
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:37,016
Thank you.

135
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:45,124
I love you.

136
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:51,158
I love you.

137
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:59,575
Come on, "l love you too, London,"
you fucker.

138
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:01,733
You can say it.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

139
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:03,742
-London, don't.
-What? What am I doing?

140
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:05,574
-This.
-What am I doing wrong?

141
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:09,514
Whatever this is, this obsession
to put a verbal label on everything.

142
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:12,519
-It's not about words.
-No, it is about words.

143
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:15,681
Because if we didn't have words,
we'd be living in caves...

144
00:13:15,858 --> 00:13:17,985
-...and still talking with our hands.
-Stop.

145
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:19,958
We haven't even
come close to a fight.

146
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:23,155
If we can avoid that first fight,
by theory we'll never fight.

147
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,664
Okay? Please.

148
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,961
It's been so perfect till now.
Don't do this.

149
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:29,604
It's been perfect for you. For you.

150
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:32,570
London.

151
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:41,716
Coming.

152
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:44,615
Wait a minute,
someone's at the door.

153
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,783
-Hello.
-Hi.

154
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,950
Wow, you look beautiful.

155
00:13:51,127 --> 00:13:53,288
You look hot.
Nice hat, nice boots.

156
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:55,124
Thanks.

157
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:58,233
-Hey.
-Hey, Becca.

158
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,638
-Rebecca.
-Bateman. Friend of Syd's.

159
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:04,899
-Nice to meet you.
-Nobody's here yet, guys.

160
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:07,303
So just come on in
and make yourself at home.

161
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,913
Okay, so you're not gonna believe
who's just fucking shown up.

162
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:18,687
Great party, mate.

163
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:22,757
Oh, it'll be better. It'll be better.
Trust me. I promise you.

164
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:24,553
Okay, I've gotta go.

165
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:30,499
Please tell me
you did not bring Syd here.

166
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,158
Oh, my God, I just rode up
in the elevator with him.

167
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:35,668
-Why? He's not invited?
-He's so not invited.

168
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:40,436
He's fucking touching
my Buddha's head.

169
00:14:40,644 --> 00:14:42,236
Hey, London, it's me.

170
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:46,508
Give me a call as soon
as you get this, okay? Okay, bye.

171
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,917
Fuck it.

172
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:52,577
Hey, Syd. Do us a favor, yeah?
Don't touch the Buddha.

173
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:55,752
Okay?

174
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:58,751
He's a fucking cocksucker.

175
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:00,624
Where did you get your hat?

176
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:02,389
It's so cute on you.

177
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:12,640
He's fucked.

178
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:16,609
To show up at someone's party.
He isn't even fucking invited.

179
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:32,251
Did they just go upstairs?

180
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:34,863
Right. Nice. Nice of them to ask.

181
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:46,237
Wait, I'm confused, did you say
you do believe in God or you don't?

182
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:50,640
"God" might not be
the appropriate word for it, actually.

183
00:15:51,648 --> 00:15:53,138
It's more of an epiphany.

184
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:54,977
Epiphany?
What was your epiphany?

185
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:58,177
Well, for me, an epiphany
is when you really see the universe...

186
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:00,254
...in all it's splendor and beauty...

187
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,653
...and you suddenly
understand everything.

188
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:04,816
-What does that mean?
-Fucking everything.

189
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:08,327
Everything you can imagine. You don't
know what "everything" means?

190
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:11,695
I know what it means. I don't know
what you mean by "everything."

191
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:15,133
It means everything, doesn't it?
You know, everything.

192
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:18,468
-So, what's your problem?
-For someone who's seen the infinite...

193
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:21,838
...you're vague. You'd think
with someone who's had a revelation...

194
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:24,878
-...you'd be more specific.
-It's not about specifics.

195
00:16:25,048 --> 00:16:28,381
It's an energy that hits you between
the eyes and you're enlightened.

196
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:30,815
-You see everything?
-You don't see everything.

197
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:33,387
You see nothing.
But you understand everything.

198
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,122
And you know what
got me the most?

199
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:40,160
-ls that I understood time horizons.
-What's a time horizon?

200
00:16:46,202 --> 00:16:48,898
It's like this. I understood
where I stood in relation...

201
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:51,870
...to where the Romans and the Jews
were 2000 years ago...

202
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,009
...and why I was here now.

203
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:56,008
Then I felt this enormous
compassion...

204
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:59,740
...for the struggle of the human race
and what it had to go through for us.

205
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,680
You know, for life as we know it
to come to this point.

206
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:07,016
It's truly remarkable, but at the same
time, it's utterly fucking disturbing.

207
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,216
I mean, we're the same people
that were living in Roman times...

208
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:14,261
...throwing boiling oil on each other
and crucifying Christians.

209
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,830
Not that that's entirely a bad thing.

210
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,830
Hey, Syd, are you in there?
It's Maya.

211
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:21,331
Oh, fuck! Fuck me.

212
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:25,702
-Fuck, fuck. Give me one second.
-What the fuck have you done?

213
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,502
-Sorry. Fuck.
-You clumsy bastard.

214
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:29,412
-What have you fucking done?
-Shit.

215
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:34,014
Look at that.

216
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,013
It's covered in fucking beer.

217
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:37,618
-Fuck.
-Oh, my God.

218
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,583
What are you gonna do?

219
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:42,553
-Goddamn it, Syd.
-lnstant karma.

220
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,249
-I got it.
-That's enough to give up blasphemy.

221
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:46,520
-Get up here.
-No, we can totally save this.

222
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:49,027
What are you gonna do,
eat food off the floor?

223
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:50,722
-Fucking gross.
-Do me a favor.

224
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,097
-God fucking damn it.
-God, is this it?

225
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,897
-Yes.
-Are you kidding?

226
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,972
-No, it's my fucking fault too.
-Just snort it off the floor.

227
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:02,633
You don't wanna do that. I shouldn't
have put it by the fucking sink.

228
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:11,552
What are you doing?

229
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:26,496
-What's that?
-As I said, all is not lost.

230
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:30,833
-Bateman, Jesus Christ.
-Oh, my God, you fucking rock.

231
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,837
-Do you know this painting?
-No.

232
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:34,908
It's Van Gogh's
Wheatfield with Crows,

233
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:37,568
The most significant painting
the man's ever painted.

234
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:39,475
-Oh, well, then.
-Fuck, it's true.

235
00:18:40,483 --> 00:18:42,314
That'll do for starters, won't it?

236
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:46,114
Look, this is the last painting
the man did before he killed himself.

237
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:49,815
It's his suicide note. He even put
his left ear in the fucking clouds.

238
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:52,927
There is his mutilated left ear.

239
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:56,428
Can you see it? Not everyone sees it,
of course, but there it is.

240
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,500
He mutilated his left ear
and put it in the fucking painting.

241
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:01,135
What does that mean?

242
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:10,141
Maya, I'm curious.
Do you believe in God?

243
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:12,337
You guys have been doing
too many drugs.

244
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:14,483
Answer the question. Yes or no?

245
00:19:15,217 --> 00:19:18,186
God, that's a really long
conversation...

246
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:21,949
...but I will tell you something I read
the other day that freaked me out.

247
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:23,557
I don't remember where it was.

248
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:26,456
It was like Russia or Germany
or one of these places...

249
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:29,359
...but these scientists,
they took this pregnant rabbit...

250
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:34,661
,,,and they hooked up to,
like, a heart monitor and an EEG,,,

251
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,532
...which sensors your brain waves.

252
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:40,163
And, like, the second after she gives
birth, they take these babies...

253
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:43,709
...and they jump in a van
and they start shooting them...

254
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:47,240
...one by one in the back of the head
with, like, a.22 rifle.

255
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:49,314
From, like one mile away:

256
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,817
Five miles away:
Twenty miles away--

257
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:54,683
Don't tell me people are
killing little bunny rabbits.

258
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:57,553
What's so interesting
is that every time they'd shoot...

259
00:19:57,726 --> 00:20:00,251
...one of these poor babies
in the back of the head...

260
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:03,590
...the mother's heartbeat
and brain waves would go crazy.

261
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:07,896
So I'm just saying there's,
you know, shit like that, and then--

262
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,368
The mother knew the babies
were getting shot--

263
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:13,838
Yes. Every fucking time. Exactly.

264
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:18,002
I mean, there's all that stuff, you know,
like those weird identical twins, right?

265
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,512
One of the brothers is
walking down the street...

266
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:22,583
,,,gets stabbed
by some serial killer,

267
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:29,214
Wait. So he gets stabbed, right?

268
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:33,020
And then 900 miles away,
at the exact same time...

269
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:35,925
,,,his twin brother falls down,

270
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:37,759
Weird, it's very weird, yes.

271
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:40,060
Do you want to let me finish
what I'm saying?

272
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:42,465
-Please, please, finish.
-Okay, he falls down.

273
00:20:42,638 --> 00:20:45,106
Gets hospitalized
due to heart palpitations...

274
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:47,469
...at the same time
his brother was stabbed.

275
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:50,271
-Why are you shaking your head?
-You sound like London.

276
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:52,971
-It's coincidence.
-How is it a coincidence?

277
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:55,946
I've had this conversation before.
I'm not having it here.

278
00:20:56,118 --> 00:21:00,248
Well, then, let's not. Then don't
ask me about God, okay, Syd?

279
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:05,390
Hey, is London here yet?

280
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:08,593
No, I don't think so.

281
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:10,322
Did you meet her boyfriend?

282
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:13,296
Yeah, a couple of times. He's nice.

283
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:19,336
Is he, like, an attractive guy?
Is he good-looking?

284
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:22,672
Are you asking me
if he's an attractive guy?

285
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:24,512
I guess.

286
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:28,639
You guess?
What do you mean, you guess?

287
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:30,341
I mean, I guess.

288
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:34,579
All right, so I'm curious. Do you think
he's more or less attractive than me?

289
00:21:35,257 --> 00:21:36,588
Syd, I don't know.

290
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:40,618
Well, you do know.
You just aren't telling me.

291
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:44,862
I don't know, Syd. You guys just--
You have totally different looks.

292
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,160
All right, yes.
We have very different looks.

293
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:49,702
But whose do you like more?
His or mine?

294
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:53,573
This is stupid, Syd.

295
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,141
Okay, fine.

296
00:21:57,312 --> 00:21:59,837
I guess, on some level,
I find him attractive.

297
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:01,880
That doesn't mean that I find him...

298
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:04,518
...any more or less attractive
than I find you.

299
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:08,847
Okay?

300
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:11,992
I won't lie to you.
Just because we're going out...

301
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,957
...doesn't mean I'm gonna,
you know...

302
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:17,462
...suddenly not be attracted
to the opposite sex.

303
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:21,396
He's a friend
who happens to be attractive.

304
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:24,868
It was one lunch.
Why are you freaking out?

305
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,806
You don't see me going to lunch
with a bunch of attractive people.

306
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:34,142
Okay. First of all,
it was one guy, not a bunch.

307
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:38,912
And it's really not my problem that
you don't have female friends, is it?

308
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:43,023
Because no one's stopping you
from having female friends.

309
00:22:46,395 --> 00:22:48,158
I love this, by the way.

310
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:56,701
-So for the sake of conversation....
-Syd.

311
00:22:56,872 --> 00:22:59,841
-Let's just pretend you and l...
-Please, can we just drop it?

312
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:02,169
...don't know each other.
Just listen to me.

313
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:06,110
Let's pretend for five minutes
you don't know me, I don't know you.

314
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:08,112
Me and what's-his-name
are in the room.

315
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:10,376
-Who do you pick?
-I do know you, Syd.

316
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:12,019
Remove that from the equation.

317
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:14,553
-You can't.
-Gun to your head. Who do you pick?

318
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:18,215
I would pick you.
I would pick you in any equation.

319
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,855
Are you all right in there?

320
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:23,554
Everything is fine. Thank you.

321
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:29,194
Syd, literally, this has got to be one
of the most insane conversations...

322
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:31,168
...I've ever had with you.

323
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:33,971
I don't want to fuck him. I don't.

324
00:23:34,176 --> 00:23:35,575
-Fuck him?
-lt was one lunch.

325
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:37,405
Who said anything
about fucking him?

326
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:40,742
-I didn't say fucking, I said attracted.
-That's what you meant.

327
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,781
-It's not.
-Please keep your voice down.

328
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:44,748
I meant attracted, you said fuck.

329
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,582
Can you just fucking
shut the fuck up?

330
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,579
What do you want?

331
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:53,095
I want you to answer
the fucking question.

332
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:02,231
Syd, you're a cute guy. You are.
You really, really are, but I don't know.

333
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:05,238
He has this angular, sexy,
Diesel-ad thing going on.

334
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:06,841
But I don't even know him.

335
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:09,068
-So maybe he's an asshole.
-You know what?

336
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:12,581
Fuck you, Maya. If you were my friend,
you would've lied.

337
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:15,945
Syd. Syd, you are at
her going-away party.

338
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:18,280
If you don't calm down,
you'll drive me...

339
00:24:18,454 --> 00:24:23,949
...and you, and everyone else,
and her at this fucking party crazy.

340
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:27,096
Just say goodbye and let her go,
because she's gone.

341
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:30,323
She's gone, man.

342
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:36,271
Line, anyone?

343
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:42,043
No. No, thank you.
But do you have a cigarette?

344
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:43,974
I'm sorry.

345
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:16,174
Light. I'm sorry.

346
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:24,211
All right, all right, you know what?
I'm gonna go.

347
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:27,049
-Are you leaving?
-Thank you. Thank you for everything.

348
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:28,986
-Really.
-Listen, do me a favor.

349
00:25:29,158 --> 00:25:32,525
Don't tell London I'm doing blow
in here. That'll really screw me.

350
00:25:32,695 --> 00:25:35,664
You know, Syd, yeah,
you know, I'll try to remember that.

351
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:37,492
Maya, I'm serious. Please?

352
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:51,277
Hey, please tell me you're not doing
coke in my parents' bathroom.

353
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:53,415
-What?
-I saw you go upstairs.

354
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,448
-Where did you go?
-To the bathroom.

355
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:58,382
Swear to God, you're not doing coke
in my parents' house.

356
00:25:58,554 --> 00:25:59,919
Oh, my God, I swear to God...

357
00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:02,887
...I'm not doing coke
in your parents' house.

358
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,390
Okay, I'm sorry, darling.

359
00:26:06,062 --> 00:26:09,395
All right.
Have a good time. I'm sorry.

360
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:18,264
How long were you two together?

361
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:22,070
Who? Me and London?
Two and a half years.

362
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:24,877
-You split when?
-Six months and a few days ago.

363
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:27,481
You're counting, Syd.
Not a good sign, mate.

364
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:30,245
Why? Why do you say that?

365
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:35,154
Joking.
I mean, what's the girl's name?

366
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:37,757
-Maya. Can I have one of those?
-Maya.

367
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:39,724
Maya.

368
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:41,795
I'd do some terrible things to her.

369
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:45,098
She's like an X-rated Barbie doll.

370
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:47,966
-How old is she?
-I don't know, like 1 6, 1 7.

371
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:49,468
Seventeen?

372
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,000
-Now I really wanna fuck her.
-You'd fuck a 1 7-year-old?

373
00:26:54,677 --> 00:26:56,508
What, you wouldn't?

374
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,747
If it's not against the law,
what's the problem?

375
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:01,974
You can fuck a 1 5-year-old
in France.

376
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:03,914
Does that make them
all pedophiles?

377
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:07,419
Right situation, right country,
you'd fuck one too, believe you me.

378
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,458
Right, right. International waters,
deserted island, shit can happen.

379
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:14,994
But if any of my female friends
knew I fucked a 1 7-year-old...

380
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:17,462
-...they'd lose it.
-What's the matter with you?

381
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:20,329
If we told women a tenth of
the things we think and do...

382
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:22,164
...do you think we'd ever get laid?

383
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:25,273
-Like when I asked a girl to piss on me.
-To piss on you?

384
00:27:27,276 --> 00:27:30,109
Yes, mate, but I was on
a horrible amount of X at the time.

385
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,179
Did she piss on you?

386
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,950
Actually, no...

387
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:39,447
...she pissed in my mouth.

388
00:27:42,024 --> 00:27:43,651
She pissed in your mouth?

389
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:45,953
It was not a pleasant experience,
believe me.

390
00:27:48,029 --> 00:27:49,496
How the fuck does that happen?

391
00:27:49,664 --> 00:27:53,794
What is the conversation that leads to
a girl having to piss in your mouth?

392
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:55,560
It was a fucking mistress.

393
00:27:55,737 --> 00:27:59,195
-You paid an S & M chick?
-Many times.

394
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:02,566
"Many times."

395
00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:07,244
Listen, it's an expensive hobby,
both mentally and financially.

396
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:09,848
So, what's the deal?
How does it work?

397
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:13,880
I don't know if I want
to go there, you know?

398
00:28:14,055 --> 00:28:17,684
Come on, explain it. No one cares.
Did you get your shit wet? Me too.

399
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:21,818
It's my fucking Savile Row suit.
It's fucking 5 G's.

400
00:28:21,996 --> 00:28:25,454
I've kept it out of the rain all day.
Look at the state of it.

401
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:28,228
Look, I don't wanna go there.
All right, Syd?

402
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:29,836
Come on. I'm not gonna tell.

403
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:32,404
-Why the fuck do you wanna know?
-How does it work?

404
00:28:32,573 --> 00:28:36,031
-You just go over there?
-Look at you, you fucking dirtbag.

405
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,371
-You brought it up.
-You wanna go there...

406
00:28:38,546 --> 00:28:41,879
...you fucking go there. Leave my
fucking demons to myself, mate.

407
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,041
-Where is it?
-Tribeca, you cunt.

408
00:28:44,218 --> 00:28:46,550
Explain it. How does it work?
You just walk over?

409
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:50,286
Look, you phone from downstairs,,,

410
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:54,894
,,,and magically they let you in
through these enormous iron gates,

411
00:28:57,065 --> 00:28:58,089
You get all excited,

412
00:28:58,266 --> 00:29:01,201
You get all wrapped up,
You can't wait to get in there,

413
00:29:03,938 --> 00:29:06,930
The whole thought of it just
gets amongst your fucking veins,

414
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:08,598
You're into it, you know?

415
00:29:08,776 --> 00:29:10,744
All of a sudden,
they give you a form.

416
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:14,575
it's a five-page disclaimer
in fucking triplicate,

417
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:18,048
And you're like, "Hold on.
What is this? Paperwork?

418
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:19,914
I've come here
to get my dick sucked.

419
00:29:20,088 --> 00:29:22,454
I didn't come here to sign forms."
It's hilarious.

420
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:26,081
You don't pay them,
you give them a fucking donation.

421
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,889
I mean, that is so American, isn't it?
Come on.

422
00:29:30,064 --> 00:29:33,556
And then they give you a list and
a little pencil, like in the sushi bar,

423
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:36,726
You start checking off the
requirements, Whipping, spanking--

424
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:42,833
Come on, you fucking dirty
shit-cunt whore. Fucking whip me!

425
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:45,069
--nipple clamps, coprophilia,

426
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:47,578
-What's coprophilia?
-When they shit on you.

427
00:29:47,982 --> 00:29:49,415
Shit in your mouth.

428
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:52,849
You can have it in the mouth
or you can have it over a glass table,

429
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:56,353
Can you imagine? They fucking
wheel out a glass table and they just,,,

430
00:29:56,557 --> 00:29:59,355
...shit all over it,
and you're just like:

431
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,460
"You dirty bitch!"

432
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:04,996
Who the fuck
asks for that fucking misery?

433
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,532
I hope not you.

434
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:09,135
Yeah, what about me?

435
00:30:11,506 --> 00:30:14,771
Anyway, you know, there's a lot--
I mean, the list is long, mate.

436
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:17,376
-lnfantilism, you've got--
-What's infantilism?

437
00:30:17,578 --> 00:30:19,603
They make you a baby,
give you a bottle,

438
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,772
Put you in diapers, nurse you,
turn you into an infant.

439
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:27,520
I mean, it's the sickest,
most twisted place you'll ever go.

440
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:29,121
I mean, they claw your balls.

441
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,349
They'll tie your cock up
with a shoelace...

442
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:36,589
...stick truncheons up your ass.
It's twisted. It's fucking twisted.

443
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:39,629
But I'm telling you,
the moment you come....

444
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,859
The moment you come,
you are so sober.

445
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:46,537
i mean, so fucking sober,

446
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:51,007
You're like, "What have i just done?
What the fuck have i just done?

447
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,808
i've just paid $275
for some stranger,,,

448
00:30:54,982 --> 00:30:57,644
,,,some chick i don't even know,
to, like, whip me,,,

449
00:30:57,818 --> 00:30:59,649
,,,and piss on my head, "

450
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:03,816
So where's the upside?
Why do you do it? I don't get it.

451
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:08,223
Well, on a physical level,
it can be rather pleasurable.

452
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,827
Psychologically-- This is without
getting too deep here.

453
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,094
--I think it has a lot to do
with pain and self-flagellation...

454
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,602
...both literally and metaphorically.

455
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:21,435
I mean, I don't know whether
it's the culture or what...

456
00:31:21,642 --> 00:31:25,169
...but the English, in general,
are very into pain and spanking.

457
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:27,211
The English? Really?

458
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:30,009
Yeah, you're always reading
some story in the papers...

459
00:31:30,184 --> 00:31:32,778
,,,about some judge or vicar
bent over a hooker's knee,

460
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:37,523
I didn't know the English
were so fucked up.

461
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:40,217
Mate, the English are very...

462
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:43,386
...I mean, very fucked up.

463
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,402
Yeah, one sec.

464
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:54,468
Sweating like a fucking rapist.

465
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:58,969
Syd.

466
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,909
Come and have a look at the view.

467
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:06,082
Yeah. It's Mallory,
the girl from the bar. I'll hook you up.

468
00:32:06,254 --> 00:32:07,653
-Come back in.
-Who?

469
00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:09,619
Mallory. The girl from the bar.

470
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,156
-She's hot. I'll hook you up.
-No, no, mate, no.

471
00:32:12,326 --> 00:32:15,090
I'm too-- I'm wanked, mate.
I can't be fucking with girls.

472
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:16,890
So what? So am l.

473
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:19,464
I've been drinking this piss.
No, I can't, fuck it.

474
00:32:19,634 --> 00:32:21,465
-I can't operate like this.
-Who cares?

475
00:32:21,636 --> 00:32:24,127
-I'm fucking dizzy.
-She'll be in and out.

476
00:32:24,305 --> 00:32:26,398
You help yourself to that,
I'm gonna leave.

477
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:28,769
-It's been a fucking pleasure.
-Don't leave.

478
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:31,673
Please don't fucking leave.
Go get a drink, come back.

479
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,837
-No, mate, no.
-Bateman, one fucking drink.

480
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:36,347
Come right back.
Work Mallory, she's hot.

481
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:38,610
Fuck you. A drink of what?
What do you want?

482
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:40,981
Anything. A bottle.
Jack, tequila, whiskey.

483
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:42,986
You're staying, though, right?

484
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:45,521
-One fucking drink.
-One fucking drink.

485
00:32:45,726 --> 00:32:49,628
Fine, fine, just don't go anywhere.
You'll fucking thank me.

486
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:03,271
I haven't had a bump
in like three hours.

487
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:05,275
Bateman, this is my friend Mallory.

488
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:07,641
Mallory, this is Bateman.

489
00:33:07,815 --> 00:33:09,612
Hey.

490
00:33:09,784 --> 00:33:11,547
You're the guy from the bar, right?

491
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:13,846
Mallory, yeah?

492
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:15,489
Bateman.

493
00:33:15,657 --> 00:33:17,454
Nice to meet you.

494
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,388
-Sorry.
-Excuse me.

495
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,393
-What a clumsy idiot.
-Sorry.

496
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:26,125
Well, how do you guys
know each other?

497
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:29,064
A friend of a friend.

498
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,897
What friend?

499
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:36,033
I don't know, Mallory.
What's with the 20 Questions? Fuck.

500
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,974
Just asking. So, what,
are you leaving or something?

501
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:42,378
I'm just gonna grab us a drink
and then...

502
00:33:42,784 --> 00:33:45,810
...I'm coming back.
Do you want one?

503
00:33:47,088 --> 00:33:49,488
Sure, I'll have another one.

504
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:51,352
-I'll see you in a minute.
-Good.

505
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:53,084
I'll see you in a minute, Syd.

506
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:01,063
Damn, kid.

507
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:06,434
So how do you know that guy?

508
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,608
He got this blow. He's not
a dealer, he just knew the guy.

509
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:13,405
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Good guy, right?

510
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:16,846
-Yeah.
-Hey, you don't know if London's here.

511
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:18,781
Yeah, she got here like a minute ago.

512
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:21,683
What'd she say?
Does she know I'm here?

513
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:24,950
No. She didn't say anything.

514
00:34:33,034 --> 00:34:36,697
I can't believe she's leaving tomorrow.
That's just so fucked up to me.

515
00:34:36,871 --> 00:34:41,137
Well, instead of staying here all night,
why don't you go out and talk to her.

516
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:43,742
-I'm sure she'd love to talk to you.
-I doubt that.

517
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:47,074
Why wouldn't she wanna talk to you?
You guys in a fight?

518
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:49,739
A fight? Mallory, she hasn't
called me in two months.

519
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:52,613
I wasn't invited tonight.
Don't you think it's odd...

520
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:55,915
...she wouldn't tell me she's moving
across the fucking country?

521
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,421
-She didn't call you?
-No.

522
00:34:57,592 --> 00:34:59,890
-That's fucked up.
-Didn't even leave a message.

523
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:04,088
-I know that girl better than anybody.
-When's the last time you talked?

524
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:07,393
-I don't know, two months.
-Really?

525
00:35:07,735 --> 00:35:11,227
-I'm sure she was gonna call you.
-When? I just checked my messages.

526
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:15,466
-ls she gonna call me from LAX?
-Dude, I don't fucking know. Man.

527
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:17,634
Fucked up!

528
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:22,775
Hey, Syd, can I ask you
something personal?

529
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,508
What?

530
00:35:24,986 --> 00:35:26,920
Well....

531
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:32,289
It's probably-- I don't know if it's true,
that's obviously why I'm asking...

532
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,952
...and since we're cool and all,
I just figured-- I'm kind of concerned.

533
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,123
But l-- Anyway, I kind of heard that--

534
00:35:40,301 --> 00:35:43,429
-What? Something about London?
-I heard-- It's probably bullshit.

535
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:46,334
-But I heard you--
-What, Mallory? Spit it out. Fuck.

536
00:35:46,507 --> 00:35:50,967
Dude, I kind of heard that
you tried to kill yourself.

537
00:35:51,312 --> 00:35:54,475
-What? Who told you that? London?
-No, it wasn't London.

538
00:35:54,649 --> 00:35:56,844
-Who told you that? Who?
-Dude, I don't know.

539
00:35:57,018 --> 00:35:58,383
I don't even remember.

540
00:35:58,553 --> 00:36:00,714
London's the only person
that knew about that.

541
00:36:00,922 --> 00:36:03,914
So any way you heard it,
it's pretty fucked up.

542
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:08,458
-So, what? It's not true?
-No, it's not fucking true.

543
00:36:09,163 --> 00:36:11,529
Dude, I don't get it.
What the fuck happened then?

544
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:16,193
You tell me what you heard happened,
then I'll tell you what really happened.

545
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:19,565
Just after this bump. Hold up.

546
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:22,999
All right. Okay.

547
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:26,977
I heard that, like, you guys had a fight
or something, and you broke out...

548
00:36:27,148 --> 00:36:29,673
...she drove to your place,
found you unconscious...

549
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:33,378
...next to some sleeping pills, and you
had to get your stomach pumped.

550
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:37,046
Okay, now do you wanna know
what really happened?

551
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:39,522
Yeah. I mean, that's why I asked.

552
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:41,525
-You know my dog, Toker?
-Yeah.

553
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:44,324
-Yes, well, he's epileptic.
-Okay.

554
00:36:44,498 --> 00:36:48,264
-So the vet prescribed phenobarbital.
-Pheno--? What the fuck is that?

555
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:50,994
They're barbiturates.
They're downers, for his fits.

556
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:55,700
Wait a minute. Your dog has epilepsy
and got prescribed--?

557
00:36:55,877 --> 00:36:57,242
Let me finish. Anyway...

558
00:36:57,411 --> 00:37:00,380
...it was our two-year anniversary
and she thought I'd forget.

559
00:37:00,548 --> 00:37:02,573
-So--
-Syd, you always forget, Always,

560
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:07,249
Oh, fuck.

561
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:14,720
-I feel like such a bitch.
-Well, you are a bitch.

562
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:17,088
Open it.

563
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:20,028
-Open it.
-Okay.

564
00:37:30,812 --> 00:37:33,042
Oh, my God.

565
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:36,545
This is so gorgeous. How did
you know I wanted this dress?

566
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:41,120
I saw you drooling all over it
last time we were at Valentino.

567
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:43,257
I love it!

568
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:46,655
Oh, it's so beautiful.

569
00:37:48,663 --> 00:37:52,292
Thank you so much, baby.

570
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,631
There's more.

571
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:02,139
-What is that?
-It's a basketball.

572
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:07,938
What--? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

573
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:14,510
Hi, little guy. Hi, little guy.

574
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:16,554
Oh, baby.

575
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:22,687
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

576
00:38:22,864 --> 00:38:26,766
Look at him.
I can't believe you did this. I--

577
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:31,601
Thank you. Okay. Okay.

578
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:34,468
Hello?

579
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:38,609
Hey. Can I just call you back?

580
00:38:38,946 --> 00:38:41,039
No, I'm just
in the middle of something.

581
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:43,479
All right, bye.

582
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:46,947
-Who was that?
-lt was Mallory.

583
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:49,821
Look at his paws.

584
00:38:54,795 --> 00:38:58,458
-What? What is it? What's wrong?
-I heard a guy's voice on the phone.

585
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:02,529
What? Are you fucking crazy?
That was Mallory.

586
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:04,898
You swear to God?

587
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:08,375
Yes, I swear to God.

588
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:12,511
If you don't fucking believe me,
go ahead and call her.

589
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,172
Syd. Are you really gonna
fucking call her?

590
00:39:17,685 --> 00:39:19,710
Yeah, is Mallory there?

591
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:23,246
This is London's boyfriend.
Who the fuck is this?

592
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:27,150
London, what the fuck is this?
Who was that? Why did you lie?

593
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:30,024
-Let me just explain.
-You better fucking explain.

594
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:32,359
What? Why did you lie?
Are you cheating on me?

595
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:34,660
No, no. Listen.

596
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:37,167
I was really fucked up.
I was out with the girls.

597
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,602
-Fucking perfect.
-Are you gonna let me explain?

598
00:39:39,774 --> 00:39:42,072
Yes, yes, you better
fucking explain, London.

599
00:39:42,243 --> 00:39:47,010
Okay, the clubs were closing, we went
back to Becca's boyfriend's loft.

600
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:50,173
I fucking passed out.
I wake up the next morning...

601
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:53,184
...and the guy-- There was someone
lying in bed next to me.

602
00:39:53,354 --> 00:39:54,685
Then he didn't try anything?

603
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:57,346
You're fucked up in his bed,
he didn't try anything.

604
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:00,221
I find that hard to believe.
And don't fucking lie to me.

605
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:03,591
If you fucking lie to me,
I'm walking out the fucking door.

606
00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:07,097
He tried to kiss me. But there was
nothing because I pushed him away.

607
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:09,361
-lt was not a big deal--
-Define "tried."

608
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,630
I wanna know
every single fucking detail.

609
00:40:11,806 --> 00:40:14,639
Were you on or under the covers?
Was his hand on your tit?

610
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:17,801
No, Syd. He tries to kiss me
and I pushed him away.

611
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:20,641
-You pushed him away?
-Yes. I walked outside.

612
00:40:20,815 --> 00:40:23,113
Mallory called me a cab,
and I went home.

613
00:40:23,284 --> 00:40:25,149
If you went home,
why is he calling you?

614
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:27,446
-How does he have your number?
-I don't know.

615
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:30,785
Maybe Becca's boyfriend
gave him the number.

616
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:33,324
But I definitely didn't give it to him.

617
00:40:33,928 --> 00:40:38,763
Nothing happened. I swear to God.
Don't you fucking believe me? Please.

618
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:40,298
I don't know what to believe.

619
00:40:40,468 --> 00:40:42,459
You swore that was
Mallory on the phone...

620
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:44,332
...and it wasn't.
So, what the fuck?

621
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:47,770
We've dated for two years. I believed
everything you said until now.

622
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:49,933
Now I don't know
what the fuck to believe.

623
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:52,773
It's like your words are meaningless.

624
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:55,442
I just don't trust you anymore,
London.

625
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:58,278
I made a mistake.
I made a fucking huge mistake.

626
00:40:58,452 --> 00:41:01,012
-I'm sorry.
-lf it was one fucking mistake...

627
00:41:01,222 --> 00:41:03,452
...why did you say
you were gonna call back?

628
00:41:03,624 --> 00:41:05,819
Why would you tell a guy
who you don't know...

629
00:41:05,993 --> 00:41:08,826
...whose number you don't have,
you're gonna call him back?

630
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:10,327
What the fuck is that?

631
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:14,758
So I took a couple
of Toker's phenobarbital.

632
00:41:16,336 --> 00:41:19,100
Wait, you took
your dog's medication?

633
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:22,640
Phenobarbital is phenobarbital.
It doesn't matter if it was for my dog.

634
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,439
People have been taking it
recreationally for years.

635
00:41:26,613 --> 00:41:27,944
Smoke that.

636
00:41:28,115 --> 00:41:31,312
So wait a minute,
what does it do to you?

637
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:33,646
They make you feel good.
They're like downers.

638
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:35,618
-Okay.
-Anyway...

639
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:38,519
...I was pretty drunk
and I took like five or six of them.

640
00:41:38,692 --> 00:41:41,684
-Five or six doggy downers?
-Toker's 50 pounds, he takes two.

641
00:41:41,862 --> 00:41:45,559
-I'm 1 70, five or six seems pretty good.
-Shit.

642
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:48,894
The problem is that if you're drunk,
you can fall into a coma...

643
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:51,560
-...if you're not careful.
-You went into a coma?

644
00:41:51,772 --> 00:41:55,173
-What's wrong with you?
-No, I didn't go into a fucking coma.

645
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:57,537
London came back
to apologize or whatever.

646
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:01,478
Syd? Syd!

647
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,679
Syd! Somebody, please, help!

648
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:10,916
It's so fucked up. The fact she's telling
people that makes me so furious.

649
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:13,855
I would never do that to anyone.
It's just fucking rude.

650
00:42:14,027 --> 00:42:16,928
-They never pumped your stomach?
-No, I went to the hospital.

651
00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:20,157
I took a few coherency tests.
That's it. That's all.

652
00:42:20,334 --> 00:42:23,895
Do you see how reality gets twisted
when little fucking girls gossip?

653
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:27,336
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess.

654
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:31,908
-What? Do you not believe me?
-No, of course I believe you, Syd.

655
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,412
That's why I asked. I was concerned.

656
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:37,516
Makes me so livid
that she's out there...

657
00:42:37,684 --> 00:42:40,676
...telling people this warped version
of what happened.

658
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:45,214
You know what? Just please don't
go out there telling her I told you this.

659
00:42:45,392 --> 00:42:46,882
That's the last thing you need.

660
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,585
The last thing I'm gonna do
is mention your name.

661
00:42:49,763 --> 00:42:53,290
Well, honestly, if I were you, I wouldn't
even bring the shit up, okay?

662
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:56,027
It's her last night here.
Focus on something positive.

663
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:58,364
She don't wanna hear that shit.

664
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:03,070
Fuck.

665
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,803
What? What's wrong?

666
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:07,779
I don't know, I don't know.

667
00:43:07,948 --> 00:43:11,714
Because I start sweating
and my heart starts pounding...

668
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:14,877
...and I feel like my head's spinning
and the world's crashing.

669
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:18,991
And I get pulled down,
further into, like, the darkest...

670
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,152
...meanest places of my brain,
and I start suffocating.

671
00:43:23,363 --> 00:43:24,990
And you feel like you're dying.

672
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:32,666
What? What? Say something.

673
00:43:33,006 --> 00:43:36,942
-What would you like me to say?
-Anything. Something. I don't care.

674
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,111
I can't be your crutch, Syd.

675
00:43:41,281 --> 00:43:44,773
Oh, you are such a miserable
fucking human being.

676
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:47,010
Miserable in what way?

677
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:50,280
The way that you're sitting there,
taking my fucking money...

678
00:43:50,457 --> 00:43:53,984
...and I'm dying. Nothing you do
helps me. The Prozac doesn't help.

679
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:57,653
The lithium doesn't help. The Zoloft
doesn't help. Nothing you do helps.

680
00:43:57,831 --> 00:44:00,493
You're kind of a fucking asshole.

681
00:44:04,504 --> 00:44:08,600
I just wanna fucking
turn the pain off, you know?

682
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:12,142
Just give me something that
the pain can go away with, you know?

683
00:44:12,312 --> 00:44:15,281
Can you do that? Don?

684
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:19,849
I think you're doing great.

685
00:44:20,987 --> 00:44:23,114
When that anxiety hits,
it's terrifying...

686
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,815
...because you're like,
"Maybe I'm really going crazy.

687
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:28,290
Maybe I've finally
fucked with my head enough...

688
00:44:28,462 --> 00:44:30,293
...that I just detached from reality."

689
00:44:30,464 --> 00:44:32,796
-You have these horrible revelations.
-Like what?

690
00:44:32,966 --> 00:44:35,560
I started freaking out about death.
I became obsessed.

691
00:44:35,736 --> 00:44:38,728
I couldn't conceptualize not
being here. Just not being here.

692
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:42,204
One day, Mallory, you and l
are gonna be dead. Buried. Gone.

693
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:45,641
You think about religion. People are
just swallowing these concepts.

694
00:44:45,812 --> 00:44:48,542
Like God and heaven,
just to suppress our deepest fears...

695
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:51,479
...that we don't know why we're here.
It makes no sense.

696
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:53,016
It totally makes sense, okay?

697
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:57,350
At the same time it allows people
to go on living their everyday lives...

698
00:44:57,524 --> 00:45:00,823
...without constantly obsessing over
these things. These realities.

699
00:45:00,994 --> 00:45:04,430
Life, death, heaven, hell.
Existence, why we're here.

700
00:45:04,598 --> 00:45:08,398
You know, who knows,
it's possible that a god does exist.

701
00:45:08,568 --> 00:45:12,004
Energy, force, spirit, whatever
you wanna call it. I believe that.

702
00:45:12,172 --> 00:45:14,436
Fair enough.
So, what happens when you die?

703
00:45:14,608 --> 00:45:18,169
I don't know. You fucking die. Why
does there have to be an answer?

704
00:45:18,345 --> 00:45:21,405
Why can't there just be mysteries?
I don't know. Your body dies.

705
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:26,041
Your actual physical being dies,
but your spirit, I do believe, lives on.

706
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:30,019
It lives on in the world. Man, it's this
continuing thing of existence.

707
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:32,351
It doesn't have to have
a perfect answer why.

708
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:35,086
I buy that a little bit more
than an invisible guy...

709
00:45:35,262 --> 00:45:37,628
...taking checks and balances
on 6 million people.

710
00:45:37,798 --> 00:45:39,789
That sounds like Santa Claus to me.

711
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,197
It's like a fairy tale for adults
who can't handle death.

712
00:45:46,072 --> 00:45:48,267
Yeah, because if you think about it...

713
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:51,774
...there was a time that we didn't know
that the world was round...

714
00:45:51,945 --> 00:45:54,812
...or that the atom existed
or whatever, right...

715
00:45:55,014 --> 00:45:57,608
...because we didn't have
the technology to observe it.

716
00:45:57,784 --> 00:46:00,753
And then...one day we do, right?

717
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,754
So, I mean, it's totally
conceivably possible...

718
00:46:04,924 --> 00:46:10,624
...that in our lifetime, we will have
the technology to observe God...

719
00:46:10,797 --> 00:46:15,166
...or whatever it is that created us
and the planets...

720
00:46:15,335 --> 00:46:18,429
...and the universe
and everything else. Right?

721
00:46:18,605 --> 00:46:21,733
It's important to at least have faith
in the possibility...

722
00:46:21,908 --> 00:46:25,002
...of a higher being
or something, or whatever...

723
00:46:25,178 --> 00:46:26,839
...because otherwise, you're just--

724
00:46:27,046 --> 00:46:29,674
You're gonna drive yourself
completely fucking insane.

725
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:32,647
Right, but that really is
the operative word isn't it?

726
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,844
What do you mean? What word?

727
00:46:35,054 --> 00:46:38,683
"Faith." Because without faith,
what do you have? You have nothing.

728
00:46:38,858 --> 00:46:42,259
You got a few stories written 1 00
years ago, thousands of years ago...

729
00:46:42,428 --> 00:46:44,623
...by people who are more
clueless than we are.

730
00:46:44,798 --> 00:46:48,256
The same people who were crucifying
people who said the world was round.

731
00:46:48,434 --> 00:46:52,530
So, you know. I just need more proof.
I need logic to support this religion.

732
00:46:52,705 --> 00:46:55,469
Okay, if you want proof,
I will give you proof.

733
00:46:55,642 --> 00:46:59,009
There was a study that was done
in Japan with physicists, okay?

734
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:02,148
They took two vats of rice...

735
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,340
...they put one in one room,
and one in another room.

736
00:47:05,518 --> 00:47:09,716
They put a time-lapse camera on it
so they could observe it for a month.

737
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:13,547
They let all these people
come into one room...

738
00:47:13,726 --> 00:47:18,288
,,,and they would say, "i love you,
rice, You are the best rice,

739
00:47:18,464 --> 00:47:22,161
You are the most beautiful,
most gorgeous, sexy rice there is."

740
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:25,327
And in the other room,
they say, "l fucking hate you, rice.

741
00:47:25,505 --> 00:47:29,566
i hate you, You're the worst rice,
Fuck you, rice, you're the worst rice, "

742
00:47:29,742 --> 00:47:35,180
After a month, the rice that they
said "l love you" to? Still edible.

743
00:47:35,348 --> 00:47:38,545
The other rice looks like
fucking black sludge.

744
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:43,380
I saw the pictures. I saw, you know,
the time-lapse video.

745
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:45,990
It's a study. It's real.
I saw it with my own eyes.

746
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,925
That's your proof right there. I mean,
it's energy. We're affecting something.

747
00:47:50,129 --> 00:47:53,997
-God is energy.
-London, you're talking about rice.

748
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:57,398
Rice. It has nothing to do with religion.
Nothing to do with God.

749
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:01,870
-I gave you proof.
-I'm sorry, I don't find proof in that.

750
00:48:14,587 --> 00:48:18,182
You know what your problem is?
You're so undyingly convinced...

751
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:21,350
...that everything your parents
and teachers taught you...

752
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,587
...you hold it as
this indisputable, almighty truth.

753
00:48:24,764 --> 00:48:27,858
Syd, can we please just drop it?
Can we just fucking drop it?

754
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:30,867
You wanna drop it because
you know I'm right. Admit that...

755
00:48:31,037 --> 00:48:33,369
-...we'll talk about whatever you want.
-Shut up.

756
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:35,370
-Shut the fuck up.
-Just admit it.

757
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:38,704
You're scared to question authority
because what if they're wrong?

758
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:41,073
What if all your parents
and all your elders...

759
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:44,444
...were as scared of death as you,
and brainwashed just like you?

760
00:48:44,617 --> 00:48:46,778
You're just blind to see it.

761
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:50,556
Okay, so I'm brainwashed...

762
00:48:50,723 --> 00:48:53,556
...because I happen to think
that believing in something...

763
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:58,789
...other than meaninglessness
and nonexistence is a positive thing?

764
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:02,594
-Okay. That's really smart, Syd.
-I'm glad you agree with me.

765
00:49:02,769 --> 00:49:05,499
I was being facetious, you dipshit.

766
00:49:05,705 --> 00:49:08,139
Why are you calling me a dipshit?

767
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:14,940
Why are you calling me a dipshit?

768
00:49:15,114 --> 00:49:16,911
Because...

769
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,677
...you always have to be right.
Why do you always have to be right?

770
00:49:21,854 --> 00:49:24,118
And your ego.
Your ego, it's just huge.

771
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:27,817
-It's just out of fucking control.
-There's no need to freak out.

772
00:49:27,994 --> 00:49:29,985
Syd, because you don't know
when to stop.

773
00:49:30,163 --> 00:49:32,927
You keep going
and going and going...

774
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:37,160
...until people just wanna
smash your face in.

775
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:41,000
Okay, okay.
Maybe God doesn't exist.

776
00:49:41,174 --> 00:49:45,873
I guess me and the billions upon
billions and billions of other people...

777
00:49:46,045 --> 00:49:49,139
...who actually pray to something
are completely deluded...

778
00:49:49,315 --> 00:49:52,944
...and you are right.
You are all-knowing.

779
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,111
You're God, Syd. Isn't that what
you wanna fucking hear anyway?

780
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:59,520
-That everyone else is wrong and--?
-Doesn't everybody?

781
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:02,058
And I'm deluded?
And I am fucking deluded?

782
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:04,957
You are-- You're sick.
You're sick, Syd.

783
00:50:05,131 --> 00:50:07,622
You need fucking mental help.

784
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,634
God, you make everybody crazy.
You're making me fucking crazy.

785
00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:16,798
You just-- You blanket people with
your pseudo-intellectual bullshit...

786
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:20,139
...and then they can't fucking breathe.
You just suffocate people.

787
00:50:20,313 --> 00:50:22,304
You don't talk to people.
You talk at them.

788
00:50:22,482 --> 00:50:25,815
At least I talk about real shit.
We've been going out for two years.

789
00:50:25,985 --> 00:50:28,510
What's the most intelligent
conversation we've had?

790
00:50:28,688 --> 00:50:31,384
How many grams of fat
are in a slice of vegetarian pizza?

791
00:50:31,557 --> 00:50:35,152
-Fuck you! You're so annoying.
-No, fuck you, London!

792
00:50:35,328 --> 00:50:36,761
You are more annoying than me.

793
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:39,022
You get away with it
because no one listens.

794
00:50:39,198 --> 00:50:42,599
They stare at your tits,
thinking of ways to fuck you.

795
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:47,068
I can't fucking believe that I ever fell
in love with a fucking asshole like you!

796
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,208
-You're such a fucking asshole!
-Stop!

797
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:52,902
-I fucking hate you!
-London. Take it easy.

798
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:55,445
Stop, stop, stop.

799
00:50:57,517 --> 00:51:00,213
Stop. Stop.

800
00:51:14,267 --> 00:51:15,598
Stop.

801
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:37,347
Baby. Come on, now.

802
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:54,565
I'm not gonna get her back, am l?

803
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:06,446
I don't know.

804
00:52:07,487 --> 00:52:09,182
Why don't you go talk to her.

805
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:13,923
Are you leaving?

806
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:16,823
I'm getting really claustrophobic.
I need to get some air.

807
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:20,454
-I'm not freaking you out, am l?
-No, I'm so high right now.

808
00:52:20,633 --> 00:52:22,464
I need a drink.

809
00:52:22,635 --> 00:52:26,799
-Here, let me give you some of this.
-Can you bring that purse over?

810
00:52:26,973 --> 00:52:29,168
-Yeah, of course.
-Thanks.

811
00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:31,037
Here.

812
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,948
-Oh, thanks, man.
-Here, this is for you.

813
00:52:36,115 --> 00:52:39,312
-That's way too much.
-No, please, take it.

814
00:52:39,485 --> 00:52:41,544
-You sure?
-Yeah.

815
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:45,282
Thanks, man. That's really sweet.

816
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:55,897
So you--? Do you wanna
come out there or what?

817
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:59,038
Yeah, I'll be out there in a minute.
I'm gonna...

818
00:52:59,305 --> 00:53:01,967
-...just hang here for a minute or two.
-All right.

819
00:53:02,141 --> 00:53:04,371
See you out there, okay?

820
00:53:15,087 --> 00:53:17,385
You gotta come out.

821
00:53:22,695 --> 00:53:26,028
Hello, girls. What's your name?

822
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:29,532
We're at a party, come on.
What are you reading a book for?

823
00:53:29,969 --> 00:53:32,062
Fancy a smoke in the little room?

824
00:53:32,238 --> 00:53:35,002
We're reading, actually,
about robopathology.

825
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:37,267
Complicated little thing, aren't you?

826
00:53:37,476 --> 00:53:40,206
I was gonna leave,
then I had to make a beeline to you.

827
00:53:40,379 --> 00:53:42,609
Like I feel I know you
or something like that.

828
00:53:42,782 --> 00:53:45,182
On a one-to-ten scale...

829
00:53:45,551 --> 00:53:47,212
...you're a four. In dim light.

830
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:50,844
One lantern so I wouldn't have to
see your heinous, disfigured face.

831
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:53,184
You are absolutely--
You're beautiful.

832
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:55,925
I have to go.
That's my chopper. But before I do--

833
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,562
-It's picking you up?
-Yeah.

834
00:53:57,730 --> 00:53:59,561
I invented this move:

835
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:01,864
She likes me. She's laughing.

836
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:05,731
-How old are you?
-Eighteen.

837
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:09,002
Eighteen.

838
00:54:11,911 --> 00:54:13,708
Let me just get another drink now.

839
00:54:21,621 --> 00:54:23,987
Stop. I'm not hitting on you.

840
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:26,624
-I like your shoes.
-You do?

841
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:29,226
-Excuse me. Hey, girl, I'm out of here.
-Already?

842
00:54:29,395 --> 00:54:31,590
-I'm gonna miss you.
-I'm gonna miss you too.

843
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:34,062
-Thank you so much for coming.
-You're welcome.

844
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:36,929
-Don't get shallow on me.
-I promise. Are you kidding me?

845
00:54:37,103 --> 00:54:39,503
-I'm sorry. I'll see you later.
-Nice to meet you.

846
00:54:39,672 --> 00:54:42,300
Call us when you get home.
Let us know you're okay.

847
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,415
All right, all right, all right, come on.

848
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,414
Come on, Syd.

849
00:54:53,185 --> 00:54:57,918
You gotta mellow out.
You gotta mellow out.

850
00:54:58,124 --> 00:55:01,355
You need a beer.
You need a bottle.

851
00:55:02,962 --> 00:55:04,623
Okay.

852
00:55:07,133 --> 00:55:09,624
Stop doing blow.
You gotta stop doing coke.

853
00:55:11,137 --> 00:55:15,130
Don't grind your teeth. If she sees
you grind your teeth, you're fucked.

854
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:20,778
Come on, Syd.
Mellow out, mellow out.

855
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:23,081
Be a man. Be a man.

856
00:55:23,616 --> 00:55:25,982
There. Get a drink.
Go out there, get a drink.

857
00:55:26,152 --> 00:55:29,349
What's the worst that can happen?
What's the worst that can happen?

858
00:55:30,022 --> 00:55:32,013
I can see London. So what?

859
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:35,285
Fuck. Fuck.

860
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:40,493
Okay. You fuck up tonight, it's over.

861
00:55:52,678 --> 00:55:54,168
Okay.

862
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:05,820
Come on.

863
00:56:07,526 --> 00:56:09,426
You know I do.

864
00:56:09,628 --> 00:56:12,688
Well, if you do, if you love me,
why don't you just say it?

865
00:56:12,865 --> 00:56:17,564
Why can't you just fucking say it?
Why is it so impossible for you?

866
00:56:17,737 --> 00:56:20,399
It's-- It's three words.

867
00:56:20,573 --> 00:56:24,270
It's-- L-O-V-E Y--
It's eight fucking letters.

868
00:56:24,443 --> 00:56:26,604
You can't say eight fucking letters?

869
00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:29,213
It's not a lot of letters.

870
00:57:03,716 --> 00:57:05,547
Say it.

871
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:21,757
Tell me you were not doing
cocaine in my parents' bathroom.

872
00:57:21,934 --> 00:57:24,402
-What are you talking about?
-Don't "what are you talking about" me.

873
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:28,267
-I saw you go upstairs.
-Yeah, I went to the fucking bathroom.

874
00:57:28,441 --> 00:57:29,772
-Really?
-Yeah, I had to pee.

875
00:57:29,942 --> 00:57:32,775
Well, swear to God
you're not doing cocaine.

876
00:57:35,614 --> 00:57:37,479
Who the fuck is Bateman?

877
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:40,278
That's his friend or some shit.
I don't know.

878
00:57:40,453 --> 00:57:42,080
He's hot.

879
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:45,087
I think I want to have
hot coke sex with him.

880
00:57:45,257 --> 00:57:49,091
You fucking did cocaine!
Don't fuck with me. Are you?

881
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:52,424
Yeah, man, he's hot.
I like guys with accents.

882
00:57:52,598 --> 00:57:54,623
Oh, my God.

883
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:57,666
I gotta go.

884
00:58:03,008 --> 00:58:06,341
-So I met your girl, mate.
-What do you mean, you met her?

885
00:58:06,745 --> 00:58:10,442
Mallory, she introduced us.

886
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:13,444
I didn't say I knew you.
I didn't wanna blow your cover.

887
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:17,149
But, my God,
she is painfully gorgeous.

888
00:58:17,322 --> 00:58:18,653
Yeah, no shit.

889
00:58:18,824 --> 00:58:20,985
I'd go out there
and speak to her immediately.

890
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:24,151
I can't go out there like this.
I'm not thinking right.

891
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:27,196
If she knows I'm on blow,
she won't even talk to me.

892
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:30,392
Fuck! How do I look?
Do I look like I'm on blow?

893
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:33,561
-No, you're fine.
-No, look at me. Look at my eyes.

894
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:39,803
A bit, yeah.

895
00:58:40,912 --> 00:58:43,142
Come on. Drink some more booze.
You'll be fine.

896
00:58:43,348 --> 00:58:47,409
What was I thinking,
getting these tonight? So stupid, Syd.

897
00:58:47,586 --> 00:58:51,181
I just wanted to clear my head out.
Try and think a little bit clearer.

898
00:58:51,356 --> 00:58:54,723
Now I'm so fucking spun
I can't even think straight.

899
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,756
-Fuck.
-Happens, mate.

900
00:58:57,929 --> 00:59:01,592
I've never been particularly social
on this shit, anyway.

901
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,429
It's a lonely, lonely drug.

902
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:07,604
This is fucking crazy.

903
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,430
I should bail. I can't do this.

904
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:12,702
-Should I bail?
-You could.

905
00:59:14,679 --> 00:59:17,671
-I think you'd regret it.
-Why? Why do you say that?

906
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:20,249
Personally, I'd rather
regret something I'd done...

907
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:23,013
...than something
I was too afraid to do.

908
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:26,381
No shit.

909
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:29,921
But I haven't talked to this girl
in two fucking months.

910
00:59:30,095 --> 00:59:33,587
Everybody here hates me.
These are all her friends.

911
00:59:34,232 --> 00:59:40,137
If I go out there, it is gonna get
fucking ugly. Fucking ugly.

912
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,376
You'd think they'd have something to
take the edge off a chick leaving you.

913
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:56,385
That'd be nice.
Look, they have this theory.

914
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:58,284
Maybe it'll help. I don't know.

915
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:02,159
Fuck knows where it comes from.
The broad strokes of it are...

916
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,328
...that it takes a third of the time...

917
01:00:04,496 --> 01:00:08,057
...to recover from a relationship
as the relationship was long.

918
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:11,259
So, for example,
if the relationship lasted a year...

919
01:00:11,436 --> 01:00:13,233
...you'll be good in four months.

920
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:16,772
-Two years, you'll be clean in eight.
-It's not a third, it's a half.

921
01:00:18,577 --> 01:00:22,172
-Mate, it's a third. Trust me.
-No, mate, it's a half.

922
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,905
Maybe in England it's a third.
In America it's a half.

923
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:28,519
I dated her for two years. It's been
six months and it's getting worse.

924
01:00:28,687 --> 01:00:32,817
Six months? Come on.
What are you complaining about?

925
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:34,754
You've got two months to go.

926
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:36,450
Good behavior, maybe a month.

927
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:38,956
Bro, I appreciate the pep talk...

928
01:00:39,131 --> 01:00:41,827
...but if you haven't noticed,
I'm trying to get this girl back.

929
01:00:43,468 --> 01:00:47,097
Look, I don't know if first love
applies to that theory, anyway.

930
01:00:48,173 --> 01:00:52,769
It's been years, I still have these
horribly lucid dreams about Helen.

931
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:57,313
It's almost like your brain is trying
to compensate for the absence.

932
01:00:58,016 --> 01:01:01,850
You know, you think you're
still married, you're still in love...

933
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:05,116
...Iife's just beautiful.

934
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:08,691
All of a sudden, you wake up, look
over and she's been gone for years.

935
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,728
-Fucking horrendous.
-Yeah, no shit.

936
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:18,630
So you were married before?

937
01:01:19,204 --> 01:01:21,172
How long ago?

938
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,535
Divorced three years ago.

939
01:01:24,543 --> 01:01:28,206
-Who divorced who?
-It's not that simple.

940
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:31,340
Well, what happened?
Why did you guys split?

941
01:01:31,516 --> 01:01:36,215
-Long story, mate.
-Give me the abridged version.

942
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:39,585
"The abridged version."
Look, I don't know.

943
01:01:39,758 --> 01:01:43,057
The relationship just didn't work
on so many levels.

944
01:01:43,362 --> 01:01:45,728
We both had one foot out the door
for two years...

945
01:01:45,897 --> 01:01:48,263
...of our two-and-a-half-year
marriage.

946
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,437
You know, but it's weird. You know,
when they tell you they're leaving...

947
01:01:53,605 --> 01:01:55,903
...it's like you don't even
feel the hollowness.

948
01:01:56,074 --> 01:01:57,939
It's an emptiness
within an emptiness...

949
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:00,874
...and you're left with
slightly less than nothing.

950
01:02:01,613 --> 01:02:06,209
The person you were when you met
doesn't exist anymore. You're gone.

951
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:13,587
-So she left you?
-Syd, it's very fucking complicated.

952
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:16,453
What happened?
Did you cheat on her?

953
01:02:16,628 --> 01:02:20,394
-No, no. It's irrelevant.
-lrrelevant? How is it irrelevant?

954
01:02:20,565 --> 01:02:24,228
Besides money, infidelity's the most
relevant reason why people split up.

955
01:02:24,403 --> 01:02:26,303
Yeah, yeah. True, true.

956
01:02:26,938 --> 01:02:28,872
Come on, man.
I thought we were talking.

957
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,032
Let's talk, let's talk.
Why did your wife leave you?

958
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:34,906
Syd, it's not a pleasant scene
for me, please.

959
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:37,742
Oh, my scene's pleasant?

960
01:02:38,016 --> 01:02:40,416
Mate, I've been 21 before.
I know your pain.

961
01:02:40,585 --> 01:02:43,418
But where you're pushing me now
is not a place you wanna go.

962
01:02:43,588 --> 01:02:46,716
Wait. Are you trying to say
that since you're older than me...

963
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:49,156
-...your pain is somehow more?
-That's the case.

964
01:02:49,327 --> 01:02:50,658
Listen, first of all...

965
01:02:50,829 --> 01:02:53,957
...you don't have the slightest clue
what pain I've been through.

966
01:02:54,132 --> 01:02:56,123
Just since you're
a couple decades older...

967
01:02:56,301 --> 01:02:59,236
...doesn't mean that your pain is more
than mine. It doesn't.

968
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:01,304
Secondly, don't make
blind comparisons...

969
01:03:01,473 --> 01:03:04,101
...when you have no fucking clue
what you're comparing.

970
01:03:04,276 --> 01:03:08,804
You think having your heart broken
is pain? You think losing God is pain?

971
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:11,505
Mate, I went through that trivial shit
when I was 20.

972
01:03:11,683 --> 01:03:13,981
I'm 40 now, mate.

973
01:03:14,252 --> 01:03:17,483
Where you're trying to push me now
is not a place you wanna go.

974
01:03:17,656 --> 01:03:22,184
So why don't you do yourself a favor,
and don't fucking go there with me.

975
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:25,920
You're a fucking child.
You're just a kid.

976
01:03:26,097 --> 01:03:27,428
A kid?

977
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,260
Listen, you pompous, limey fuck...

978
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:32,835
...if you had one tenth my pain,
you'd be psychologically crippled.

979
01:03:33,004 --> 01:03:36,838
Mate, seriously, fuck off.
All we're doing is projecting shit here.

980
01:03:37,008 --> 01:03:39,636
Look, take a step back.
Let's relax, shall we?

981
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:43,178
-Do a bit of gear. Come on.
-Fuck the gear. I don't want that shit.

982
01:03:45,484 --> 01:03:47,714
-More for me.
-It's Bateman, right?

983
01:03:47,886 --> 01:03:50,719
-Nice to see your memory is still intact.
-Well, Bateman...

984
01:03:50,889 --> 01:03:55,121
...Iet me give you a glimpse into
my life, insight into my fucking pain.

985
01:03:55,293 --> 01:03:58,729
-Mate, it's not necessary. Truly.
-No, it is necessary.

986
01:03:58,897 --> 01:04:02,162
And if you didn't think it was,
you wouldn't have pushed my buttons.

987
01:04:02,334 --> 01:04:04,495
But you did.
And if you don't wanna hear it...

988
01:04:04,669 --> 01:04:07,638
...stop snorting my shit
and get the fuck out of the bathroom.

989
01:04:07,873 --> 01:04:11,570
Technically, it's my shit,
but I can see you're passionate, so go.

990
01:04:11,743 --> 01:04:13,904
So this fucker...

991
01:04:14,112 --> 01:04:18,048
...this fucking guy out in L.A.,
who my chick is now in love with...

992
01:04:18,216 --> 01:04:21,014
...he's, you know, endowed.

993
01:04:21,186 --> 01:04:24,246
-She told you that?
-Yeah. So I needed to know how big.

994
01:04:24,422 --> 01:04:26,720
Not that I give a fuck
about another guy's dick.

995
01:04:26,892 --> 01:04:29,554
It's one of those things
you feel like you need to know.

996
01:04:29,728 --> 01:04:31,923
So we're in an argument,
and I was pushing her.

997
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,427
I was like, "How big is he?"

998
01:04:33,632 --> 01:04:37,398
She was like, "Let's not make an issue
out of it." And I said, "No, fuck that."

999
01:04:37,569 --> 01:04:40,868
And she says,
"Ten and a half inches."

1000
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,564
-Jesus.
-Yeah, you believe that shit?

1001
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:46,404
She could have at least
rounded it down.

1002
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:49,513
-The girl's trying to hurt you, mate.
-Yeah, no shit.

1003
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:53,549
But it really fucked with me, you know.
Knowing that this guy is in L.A...

1004
01:04:53,718 --> 01:04:57,051
...with the only woman I love,
fucking her with 1 0 and a half inches.

1005
01:04:57,222 --> 01:05:01,352
I'm chasing her around like a puppy,
doing anything I can to get her back.

1006
01:05:01,693 --> 01:05:05,686
And it crushed me!
It still fucking crushes me!

1007
01:05:09,768 --> 01:05:11,599
Sorry, mate.

1008
01:05:13,104 --> 01:05:16,039
-How exactly do you deal with that?
-You don't deal with it.

1009
01:05:16,207 --> 01:05:18,198
It deals with you.

1010
01:05:19,911 --> 01:05:23,312
God, it eats at you
and it eats at you, you know?

1011
01:05:24,482 --> 01:05:27,940
We'd get in these fights,
and I'd say the most horrible things.

1012
01:05:28,253 --> 01:05:31,984
I'd be like, "You just want a fat cock
in your fat snatch, you fucking whore."

1013
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:34,556
You know, l'd--
Just mean, horrible things.

1014
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:37,456
I'd be so fucking angry, you know?

1015
01:05:40,465 --> 01:05:44,492
I used to say the same shit, mate. I
used to say the most horrendous shit.

1016
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,762
Why? What'd she do?

1017
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,733
She didn't really do anything.

1018
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:55,004
You know, I imagine that
a lot of it had to do with me.

1019
01:05:55,213 --> 01:05:58,011
A lot of it had to with my hang-ups
and depression and shit.

1020
01:05:58,216 --> 01:06:02,915
But, my God, I used to say the worst
shit to her. I tormented that girl.

1021
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:06,353
I lived with her for three and a half
fucking years and I hated her.

1022
01:06:06,524 --> 01:06:07,855
So, what was the final snap?

1023
01:06:08,026 --> 01:06:10,586
Did you cheat on her?
Did she cheat on you?

1024
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:12,093
No, no. God, no.

1025
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:15,255
-How do you know?
-Because I didn't, you know? I didn't.

1026
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:18,960
-How do you know she didn't?
-I know she didn't. It wasn't her thing.

1027
01:06:19,137 --> 01:06:20,468
How do you know?

1028
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:23,130
I was with the most beautiful girl
in the universe.

1029
01:06:23,308 --> 01:06:25,970
She didn't fuck me
for two fucking years!

1030
01:06:26,144 --> 01:06:27,941
-Why?
-I don't know.

1031
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:30,638
Because we fought. I was in therapy.

1032
01:06:30,815 --> 01:06:34,182
I don't-- I don't-- Look, I don't know.

1033
01:06:36,621 --> 01:06:38,646
If you wanna know it is, I'll tell you.

1034
01:06:38,823 --> 01:06:40,984
You remember sentences
that people say to you.

1035
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:44,651
They stick in your mind like gunshot
wounds that never fucking heal.

1036
01:06:46,164 --> 01:06:49,190
I remember what my ex-wife
said to me when we started dating.

1037
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:53,895
She said, "l love it when a guy
fucks me four, five times a night."

1038
01:06:54,072 --> 01:06:56,973
-Four, five times a night?
-Yeah. Truly.

1039
01:06:57,142 --> 01:06:58,769
I was like, "You was with some guy...

1040
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:02,037
...who fucked you
four, five times a night?"

1041
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:05,216
-You wanna know what pain is?
-What?

1042
01:07:05,216 --> 01:07:07,185
-I'll tell you what pain is, you fuck.
-Why you calling me a fuck?

1043
01:07:07,185 --> 01:07:08,413
-I'll tell you what pain is, you fuck.
-Why you calling me a fuck?

1044
01:07:08,586 --> 01:07:10,918
Because, my friend,
you brought me here...

1045
01:07:11,088 --> 01:07:14,421
...and I didn't particularly
wanna go here, but now I am.

1046
01:07:14,592 --> 01:07:16,753
If you don't wanna go
where I'm about to go...

1047
01:07:16,928 --> 01:07:19,829
...then tell me right now
and I'll walk out the door...

1048
01:07:19,997 --> 01:07:22,864
...I'll phone my therapist
and that will be it, okay?

1049
01:07:23,034 --> 01:07:26,003
No, fuck that, I wanna hear this.
You're not going anywhere.

1050
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:29,264
-You wanna know what it is?
-Yes, I wanna know what it is.

1051
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,841
Motherfucker, you wanna know
what it is? Pain, my friend...

1052
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:35,740
...is when the woman you love
wants to fuck you...

1053
01:07:35,913 --> 01:07:38,609
...four, five times a night,
and you can't!

1054
01:07:38,816 --> 01:07:42,377
-Why?
-Why? Why?

1055
01:07:42,553 --> 01:07:45,716
I'll tell you why.
Because I'm an impotent man!

1056
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:48,950
Motherfucker, that's pain!

1057
01:07:49,126 --> 01:07:51,287
That's fucking pain!

1058
01:07:51,462 --> 01:07:54,625
When your wife wants
to fuck you four times a night...

1059
01:07:54,832 --> 01:07:56,459
...and you fucking can't!

1060
01:07:56,634 --> 01:07:58,625
You know that some fucker
before you could.

1061
01:07:58,836 --> 01:08:03,239
And you know that some fucker
after you will!

1062
01:08:05,343 --> 01:08:07,868
Well, I couldn't
cope with that, could l?

1063
01:08:08,045 --> 01:08:10,309
That sense of ruination...

1064
01:08:10,481 --> 01:08:13,416
...that insolvency
that burns in your soul.

1065
01:08:13,584 --> 01:08:15,779
I couldn't fuck my wife!

1066
01:08:15,953 --> 01:08:17,978
Do know what
that fucking means, mate?

1067
01:08:18,155 --> 01:08:22,251
Do you understand
what impotent rage really is?!

1068
01:08:22,426 --> 01:08:25,259
-I'm sorry.
-You have no fucking idea, mate!

1069
01:08:28,466 --> 01:08:30,730
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, you're sorry?

1070
01:08:30,901 --> 01:08:32,266
Oh, you're sorry, are you?

1071
01:08:33,271 --> 01:08:37,571
You dare, you fucking dare
ask me if there's a God?

1072
01:08:37,742 --> 01:08:42,839
Well, man, I feel forsaken.
I feel cheated, you cunt!

1073
01:08:43,014 --> 01:08:49,180
I've lost in the big game,
and nothing else fucking matters.

1074
01:08:49,387 --> 01:08:53,187
It doesn't matter what you do.
If you can't hack it in the sack, mate...

1075
01:08:53,391 --> 01:08:56,656
...if you can't hack it
in the game of love and sex...

1076
01:08:56,827 --> 01:08:58,454
...you are shit, my friend.

1077
01:08:58,829 --> 01:09:03,289
Because you can't do what the other
man can do to your fucking wife, mate!

1078
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:12,036
I know what you mean.

1079
01:09:12,209 --> 01:09:15,645
No, motherfucker,
you do not know what I mean!

1080
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:20,314
You couldn't possibly know
what the fuck I mean!

1081
01:09:25,356 --> 01:09:27,449
I failed.

1082
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,059
I fucking failed, mate.

1083
01:09:31,996 --> 01:09:35,625
And I'm still failing
every fucking day of my life!

1084
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,927
Every day.

1085
01:09:40,037 --> 01:09:42,505
Every fucking day.

1086
01:09:57,388 --> 01:09:58,855
You know....

1087
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:01,488
Thought you were gonna
clock me for a minute.

1088
01:10:01,692 --> 01:10:04,820
I wasn't gonna hit you.
I'm projecting.

1089
01:10:04,995 --> 01:10:08,522
You should see my group therapy
sessions. They're fucking psychotic.

1090
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,034
Yeah, I'll bet.

1091
01:10:11,235 --> 01:10:15,672
Mate, do yourself a favor,
please, for me.

1092
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,001
Go and talk to your chick.

1093
01:10:19,043 --> 01:10:22,206
I can't. To be honest, I'm thinking
about making for the elevator.

1094
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:25,508
I can't go out like this.
She doesn't even want me here.

1095
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:28,711
Look, I hate to break it to you, mate...

1096
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,586
...but by now
she knows you're here...

1097
01:10:31,756 --> 01:10:34,247
...and, unfortunately,
time is not on your side.

1098
01:10:34,425 --> 01:10:37,394
What are you gonna do,
wait outside like a fucking stalker?

1099
01:10:37,561 --> 01:10:39,529
Wouldn't be the first time.

1100
01:10:41,265 --> 01:10:45,201
-Go, man, go. Come on.
-No, I can't, I can't, I can't.

1101
01:10:45,603 --> 01:10:47,935
Listen to me. God.

1102
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:51,374
Listen to me, you might not have
a 1 0-and-a-half-inch cock...

1103
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:53,601
...but at least you can still fuck her.

1104
01:10:53,778 --> 01:10:56,246
So quit worrying about
all the bullshit.

1105
01:10:57,948 --> 01:11:00,439
The fact is, she's here, you're here.

1106
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:04,520
Life's too short
to be a pussy, mate. Truly.

1107
01:11:07,224 --> 01:11:08,748
Come on.

1108
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:41,618
I think I would love to do that. I don't
really know a lot of people there.

1109
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:44,693
Not a whole lot going on in L.A.,
but we'll find something.

1110
01:11:44,862 --> 01:11:47,626
Hey, London.
Could I talk to you for a second?

1111
01:11:47,798 --> 01:11:49,459
Yeah. What is it?
What do you want?

1112
01:11:53,337 --> 01:11:56,500
I wanna know if we can go somewhere
and talk for a second, please.

1113
01:11:58,642 --> 01:12:01,475
You don't wanna talk here?
We can't just talk right here?

1114
01:12:02,679 --> 01:12:04,010
Please.

1115
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:06,479
Syd,
A, this is my going-away party...

1116
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:10,313
...and I think it would be pretty uncool
to the people who threw it for me...

1117
01:12:10,487 --> 01:12:13,320
...if I left just because
you wanted to talk.

1118
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:16,186
And, B, I don't know
if you noticed...

1119
01:12:16,393 --> 01:12:19,294
...but we were kind of
in the middle of a conversation...

1120
01:12:19,463 --> 01:12:21,328
...so I don't know what to tell you.

1121
01:12:24,635 --> 01:12:28,469
Listen, I'm gonna grab another drink.
Can l--? Can I get you something?

1122
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,530
Actually, yeah.

1123
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:34,142
I'd love something.
Something strong.

1124
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:35,869
-Fuck me up.
-All right.

1125
01:12:37,614 --> 01:12:40,640
What about you, bruiser?
What are you drinking?

1126
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:44,812
Is that a bottle of cockblocker?

1127
01:12:54,865 --> 01:12:56,492
So....

1128
01:12:56,867 --> 01:13:00,098
I heard you've been snorting drugs
all night. Really productive.

1129
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:02,670
I heard you told people
I tried to kill myself.

1130
01:13:02,839 --> 01:13:05,706
That's really fucking great of you.
I really appreciate it.

1131
01:13:05,876 --> 01:13:08,367
Who the fuck told you that?
I would never say that.

1132
01:13:08,545 --> 01:13:10,877
-You know that.
-The fact is, I have known you...

1133
01:13:11,048 --> 01:13:13,710
...since you were 1 0.
We have been through everything.

1134
01:13:13,884 --> 01:13:15,784
And you don't have
the decency to call--

1135
01:13:16,019 --> 01:13:18,544
-Please keep your voice down?
-What the fuck is that?!

1136
01:13:18,755 --> 01:13:21,553
-You wanna talk? Fine, let's go.
-Get the fuck off me.

1137
01:13:22,693 --> 01:13:24,593
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1138
01:13:25,562 --> 01:13:27,621
-I'm sorry, excuse me. I'm sorry.
-What?

1139
01:13:28,365 --> 01:13:30,595
-London, are you okay?
-Yeah.

1140
01:13:30,767 --> 01:13:32,894
We're just gonna--
We're gonna go and talk.

1141
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:36,733
Yeah? Because if you want, I'll call
security and have him taken out.

1142
01:13:36,907 --> 01:13:39,569
Becca, could you do me a favor?
Stay out of this?

1143
01:13:39,776 --> 01:13:43,542
You've been doing coke in the
bathroom all night so don't tell me...

1144
01:13:43,713 --> 01:13:46,204
...what I can and can't do
in my own fucking house...

1145
01:13:46,383 --> 01:13:48,442
...considering you
weren't even invited.

1146
01:13:48,685 --> 01:13:51,245
It's cool, Bec. We're gonna go.
It's gonna be fine.

1147
01:13:51,421 --> 01:13:54,481
It's not cool, London.
Baby, he wasn't invited.

1148
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:56,784
You didn't want him here,
I didn't want him.

1149
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,554
-No one wants him here.
-Becca, can you relax? Please?

1150
01:13:59,729 --> 01:14:02,721
-Don't tell me to relax.
-Why can't you relax for two seconds?

1151
01:14:02,899 --> 01:14:05,561
-We're leaving.
-You're shouting at my fucking party.

1152
01:14:05,735 --> 01:14:08,169
Also you're psychotic.
You couldn't take a hint...

1153
01:14:08,338 --> 01:14:11,501
...if it smashed you in the face.
She doesn't want to be with you.

1154
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:14,006
-Not even 20 seconds.
-We're leaving. Let's go.

1155
01:14:14,211 --> 01:14:16,475
-Bec, we're leaving. I'm sorry.
-You know what?

1156
01:14:16,646 --> 01:14:19,638
I'm sorry, London, and I'm not
trying to be a bitch here...

1157
01:14:19,816 --> 01:14:22,148
...but when you come back,
you come back alone.

1158
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:25,083
I don't want you
in my house again, all right?

1159
01:14:25,288 --> 01:14:26,619
Or I will call the cops.

1160
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:29,657
Becca, I'm really trying
to be calm here, all right?

1161
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:32,988
Fuck off. I'm so tired of you
and your psycho fucking shit.

1162
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:34,629
You wanna talk about psycho?

1163
01:14:34,798 --> 01:14:37,266
-Let's talk about your fucked-up life.
-Stop it.

1164
01:14:37,534 --> 01:14:40,697
-Fuck you!
-Fuck this! You wanna fuck with me?

1165
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:43,635
You wanna fuck with me?
Let's do it right fucking now.

1166
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:46,968
Why don't you fuck off, alrighty?

1167
01:14:47,144 --> 01:14:49,339
You weren't even invited to this.

1168
01:14:49,513 --> 01:14:53,176
-You wanna fuck with me?
-Stop it. We're leaving right now!

1169
01:14:54,384 --> 01:14:57,114
How many friends did you fuck
freshman year? Fifteen, 20?

1170
01:14:57,287 --> 01:15:00,450
I think I lost count. Was it
the whole fucking pledge class?

1171
01:15:00,657 --> 01:15:02,648
Jay, you never really know
your girlfriend.

1172
01:15:02,826 --> 01:15:04,623
Isn't that a total mind-fuck?

1173
01:15:04,861 --> 01:15:06,692
You're a fucking bastard!

1174
01:15:07,397 --> 01:15:10,855
You fucking wanker! Get the fuck
out of my fucking house!

1175
01:15:12,335 --> 01:15:13,666
Hey!

1176
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,701
-Fuck you.
-Come on, then!

1177
01:15:15,906 --> 01:15:18,670
Fucking prick.
You want some, you fucking slag?

1178
01:15:23,413 --> 01:15:24,812
Hey, Syd!

1179
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:30,581
Here, you cunt.
Have some of that, you fuck.

1180
01:15:30,787 --> 01:15:32,186
Fuck off. Come on, then.

1181
01:15:39,062 --> 01:15:40,689
Hey, Syd!

1182
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:46,928
Get off, you fucking asshole.

1183
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:50,003
You fucker. Get the fuck off him.

1184
01:15:50,173 --> 01:15:52,038
Come on.

1185
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:54,036
Wait a minute, I gotta get Bateman.

1186
01:15:54,211 --> 01:15:57,305
What? Who the fuck is Bateman?

1187
01:15:58,448 --> 01:16:01,940
Come on, you cunts!
You want some, do you? Do you?

1188
01:16:02,118 --> 01:16:04,814
Let's go, Bateman. Come on.

1189
01:16:07,624 --> 01:16:10,286
-My coat. My Burberry coat.
-Fuck it, leave the jacket.

1190
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,587
-I've had it 1 0 fucking years.
-I'll get it.

1191
01:16:12,762 --> 01:16:15,356
-Are you fucking crazy?
-We'll be downstairs.

1192
01:16:15,532 --> 01:16:17,557
Guy's fucking nuts.

1193
01:16:19,202 --> 01:16:20,794
-You're bleeding.
-I am so sorry.

1194
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:22,905
-Where?
-This is fucking insane.

1195
01:16:23,073 --> 01:16:25,098
-You are insane.
-I am so sorry.

1196
01:16:25,275 --> 01:16:27,106
If you wanna go back, I understand.

1197
01:16:27,277 --> 01:16:30,906
-You don't wanna talk?
-Yeah, I wanna talk. I mean....

1198
01:16:31,081 --> 01:16:33,481
Well, where?
Where do you wanna go?

1199
01:16:33,717 --> 01:16:35,981
My car's two blocks away
if you want coffee.

1200
01:16:36,152 --> 01:16:39,121
-Yeah, okay.
-All right. Okay.

1201
01:16:56,172 --> 01:16:59,733
Look, you're probably not
gonna believe this at all...

1202
01:17:01,277 --> 01:17:05,236
...but I was kind of glad
when I heard you were at the party.

1203
01:17:13,823 --> 01:17:16,121
Ever since you and I broke up,
I've wanted...

1204
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:20,695
...to have a normal conversation,
just a normal conversation with you.

1205
01:17:20,896 --> 01:17:25,265
And I just feel like every time
I see you, it just gets so, like....

1206
01:17:25,434 --> 01:17:29,530
Like, weird and chaotic and scrambled,
and I can't organize my thoughts...

1207
01:17:29,705 --> 01:17:33,607
...and I can't even express the most
basic things I want to say to you.

1208
01:17:33,776 --> 01:17:36,472
I know. Me too.

1209
01:17:38,614 --> 01:17:41,549
Whatever we had when we were
together, when we were in love...

1210
01:17:41,717 --> 01:17:46,882
...that feeling of just being able to lie in
bed with someone for days and days...

1211
01:17:47,056 --> 01:17:50,025
...and not give a fuck
about the outside world...

1212
01:17:52,662 --> 01:17:55,130
...is gone.

1213
01:17:55,665 --> 01:17:59,123
And I feel like there's nothing
I can do to ever get it back.

1214
01:17:59,835 --> 01:18:02,326
Do you know how painful that is?

1215
01:18:02,972 --> 01:18:04,872
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1216
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:07,066
I cried for weeks when we broke up.

1217
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:09,405
You cried for weeks?

1218
01:18:09,578 --> 01:18:10,943
Yes.

1219
01:18:11,147 --> 01:18:15,311
The hardest thing
I've ever dealt with in my life.

1220
01:18:18,487 --> 01:18:20,751
How long did you go through that?

1221
01:18:22,024 --> 01:18:25,551
A long time. A long time.

1222
01:18:26,228 --> 01:18:30,824
I mean, the first month,
it was so fucking bad. And then...

1223
01:18:31,567 --> 01:18:35,401
...you know, slowly, it gets better.

1224
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:40,372
That's the difference
between you and me, London.

1225
01:18:43,512 --> 01:18:45,002
I'm still going through it.

1226
01:18:48,851 --> 01:18:53,083
I tried to call you
a dozen times today.

1227
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:56,351
I'm terrified. I'm-- I'm afraid.

1228
01:18:56,525 --> 01:18:58,254
Of what? What are you afraid of?

1229
01:18:58,427 --> 01:19:01,692
I'm afraid of falling in love
with you again.

1230
01:19:15,444 --> 01:19:17,742
-Sorry, Syd.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
01:19:18,714 --> 01:19:20,944
Yeah, man, you fucked
your eye up.

1232
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:23,710
Yeah, great party, mate.

1233
01:19:23,886 --> 01:19:25,979
It was fucking insane.

1234
01:19:26,155 --> 01:19:29,716
-But good chat, seriously.
-Definitely.

1235
01:19:29,892 --> 01:19:32,918
You know, they say the greatest
conversation you'll ever have...

1236
01:19:33,095 --> 01:19:35,655
-...is with a stranger?
-Who says that?

1237
01:19:35,831 --> 01:19:37,230
Some useless cunt.

1238
01:19:39,068 --> 01:19:41,127
You guys need a ride?
We can go uptown.

1239
01:19:41,604 --> 01:19:43,799
Me and Mallory....

1240
01:19:45,608 --> 01:19:48,441
Don't know. We're gonna
catch a late drink...

1241
01:19:48,611 --> 01:19:52,445
...cup of tea, something or other.

1242
01:19:52,615 --> 01:19:54,549
Raise the flag, perhaps.

1243
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,651
Good luck. Thank you.

1244
01:19:58,053 --> 01:20:00,419
That's it. Thank you, mate. Truly.

1245
01:20:07,997 --> 01:20:10,864
London, lovely name, darling.

1246
01:20:11,066 --> 01:20:12,363
-Thanks.
-Nice to meet you.

1247
01:20:12,568 --> 01:20:14,468
-Have a safe flight.
-Nice to meet you.

1248
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:16,599
-Come by the bar, all right?
-I will.

1249
01:20:16,772 --> 01:20:19,206
London, call me. Have a safe flight.

1250
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,104
We're gonna catch a little drink.

1251
01:20:21,277 --> 01:20:23,006
All right.

1252
01:20:39,228 --> 01:20:41,355
Can I ask you something?

1253
01:20:44,667 --> 01:20:46,362
Yeah.

1254
01:20:47,203 --> 01:20:48,966
You do love him?

1255
01:20:51,407 --> 01:20:53,238
I never said I was in love with him.

1256
01:20:56,145 --> 01:20:57,544
Listen, Syd.

1257
01:21:00,115 --> 01:21:02,083
It's gonna be a really,
really long time...

1258
01:21:02,251 --> 01:21:05,084
...before, you know,
I fall in love with anybody...

1259
01:21:05,254 --> 01:21:07,552
...the way that I was in love with you.

1260
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:17,183
What time is it?

1261
01:22:20,429 --> 01:22:23,660
It's like 6:30.

1262
01:22:23,832 --> 01:22:25,891
Six-thirty? Fuck. Shit.

1263
01:22:26,068 --> 01:22:30,562
My plane leaves in like an hour.
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1264
01:23:33,502 --> 01:23:35,663
I will see you again.

1265
01:23:37,205 --> 01:23:39,070
I promise.

1266
01:23:42,344 --> 01:23:44,812
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1267
01:23:46,682 --> 01:23:49,014
I'm gonna miss you too.

1268
01:23:54,823 --> 01:23:56,882
I gotta go.

1269
01:24:09,671 --> 01:24:11,298
Sorry.

1270
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:16,737
-Hello.
-Hi.

1271
01:24:16,912 --> 01:24:20,075
Sorry, I am-- I'm just really late.

1272
01:24:20,248 --> 01:24:23,081
-I don't even know my flight number.
-That's all right.

1273
01:24:23,251 --> 01:24:25,344
Just for one second, okay?

1274
01:24:27,556 --> 01:24:30,286
-Here's my lD.
-Thank you.

1275
01:24:30,459 --> 01:24:33,860
Just give me a few minutes
while I look for your information.

1276
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:37,421
Okay. Bye.

1277
01:24:37,599 --> 01:24:39,567
Goodbye.

1278
01:25:00,088 --> 01:25:01,453
Bye.

1279
01:25:01,623 --> 01:25:03,284
Bye.

1280
01:25:03,959 --> 01:25:06,894
Okay, miss,
I have your flight information.

1281
01:25:07,062 --> 01:25:08,654
Sorry.

1282
01:25:08,997 --> 01:25:12,558
I think I might have missed my plane.
Can you make sure I'll be all right?

1283
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:14,361
London?

1284
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:17,398
I love you.

1285
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:25,371
-Can you give me a second, please?
-Sure. No problem.

1286
01:25:39,494 --> 01:25:42,429
That's the first time you said it first.

1287
01:26:15,797 --> 01:26:18,493
-Here you go. You're all set.
-Sorry.

1288
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:20,225
Okay.

1289
01:26:20,435 --> 01:26:22,198
-So I'm set? Great.
-Yeah.

1290
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:24,702
-Here's your ticket.
-Thank you.

1291
01:26:24,873 --> 01:26:27,865
-I'm not really sure where to go.
-Gate 35. Upstairs.

1292
01:26:28,043 --> 01:26:30,671
Thank you and have a great flight.
