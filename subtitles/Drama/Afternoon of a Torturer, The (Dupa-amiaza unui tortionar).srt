1
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,993
It has to be from downtown.

2
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:39,043
It's handled through this office,
but it requires downtown approval.

3
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:44,505
I don't know.

4
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:51,555
It has been submitted.

5
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,573
Sylvia, can you help me with this?

6
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:28,623
Coming.

7
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:43,027
Closing time. Going in?

8
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:50,076
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

9
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:56,373
I couldn't say.

10
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:01,177
- You the manager?
- It's a matter of policy.

11
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:03,679
It- It looks-

12
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:06,482
Keep talking like nothing was wrong.

13
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:13,532
Listen, let me call you back.

14
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:20,628
Sonny, I'm getting really bad vibes.

15
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:23,264
What are you talking about?

16
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:28,136
Maybe we should take
something smaller, Sonny.

17
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:32,774
You crazy? He started already.
He's got the gun out.

18
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:37,944
Go on, go over by the door.

19
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:44,994
Get over by the door.

20
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,161
Freeze!

21
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:34,465
- Nobody move.
- Get over there!

22
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,601
Okay. All right,
get away from those alarms.

23
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:41,137
Come on, get in the center.

24
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,206
He moves, take his head off.

25
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:46,008
Put the gun on him!
Get out of the center.

26
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,177
Sonny.

27
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:51,180
I can't do it, Sonny.

28
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:55,785
- What?
- I'm not gonna make it.

29
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,087
- What? Put it on him.
- I can't do it, Sonny.

30
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:03,391
Oh, fuck me. Sal.

31
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,461
- What?
- Where are you? He can't make it.

32
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,030
Fuck him. Let him go!

33
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,234
Come on, Sonny!

34
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,401
All right, let him out.

35
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:17,171
- Let him out!
- Do what the gentleman says, Howard.

36
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:21,342
Let him out!

37
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,310
I'm sorry, Sonny.

38
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:26,147
Oh, shit.

39
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,884
- Stevie, don't take the car.
- How do I get home?

40
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,852
Take the subway. We need the car.

41
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:37,257
Stevie, the keys.

42
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:39,259
- I'm sorry, Sonny.
- Right.

43
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,827
All right, lock it.

44
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:47,232
Shit.

45
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:54,282
- What do you want?
- Sonny, there's a girl under that desk.

46
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,582
All right, go.

47
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:07,385
We got rid of him.
So now we just move it along.

48
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,253
- Sal, you got them?
- I got them.

49
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,356
Okay. What'd he say to me?
Wait a minute.

50
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:14,592
Anybody here?
What's this, a squirrel?

51
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:17,595
Hey, you. Come on. Go ahead.

52
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,864
In the back there.
No one's gonna hurt you.

53
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,699
Go ahead, get to the back.

54
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:29,306
- Pull the drapes!
- Howard.

55
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:32,075
Now, you, to the back there.

56
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,944
Go to him, right there.

57
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:38,180
Okay. We're gonna move this now.
Just moving along.

58
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:41,617
Come on. Gotcha. Gotcha.

59
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:46,589
We're moving right along, folks. Gonna
get this thing done in half an hour.

60
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:48,424
We just gotta block...

61
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:50,326
Oh, shit.

62
00:09:50,351 --> 00:09:53,127
Here.

63
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:56,798
Knock out the TV.
There we go.

64
00:09:56,823 --> 00:10:00,401
See? No replay, folks.
No alarms.

65
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:02,637
Let's get you all fixed up
and on your way.

66
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:05,440
- Right. Is the vault open?
- I can take care of that.

67
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:11,011
That's good. Let's go.
Take care of it.

68
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:13,747
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you trying to do?

69
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:18,085
Trip the alarm?
Use the spot key?

70
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,254
- I must've been out of my mind.
- You get your mind right!

71
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,157
I'm a Catholic. I don't wanna
hurt anybody, understand?

72
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:26,292
- Yes, sir.
- No alarms.

73
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:28,027
- No alarms!
- Okay.

74
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:31,464
No games, all right?

75
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,799
Use the other one.

76
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:35,301
Miriam...

77
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:37,937
...open the safe.

78
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:44,986
It's all right. It's all right.

79
00:10:54,077 --> 00:11:01,101
Here. Put it in this.

80
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:13,637
What?

81
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:18,408
That's all there is.

82
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:19,909
What are you talking about?

83
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:22,879
They picked it up today.
There's only $1100.

84
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:26,883
- It's true.
- He's gonna shoot me.

85
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:29,552
I can't believe it.

86
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:33,221
I can't believe it.

87
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:34,723
There's no money here.

88
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:39,928
- Come on, Sonny, let's do it!
- I'm doing it!

89
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:45,067
Too much. This is too much.
This is too much.

90
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:48,335
All right, come on. Let's go.

91
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,438
Somebody- You answer it.

92
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:55,242
Watch him, Sal. You, come with me.
Watch him.

93
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:58,312
- Sit down.
- Who's the head teller here?

94
00:11:58,337 --> 00:12:04,617
- I am.
- Come here.

95
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:09,723
All right, open it up.

96
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:11,358
Nope, not all of it.

97
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:14,761
Look, I worked in a bank.
I know the alarms. All right?

98
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:16,696
Don't play games with me. See.

99
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:19,032
You take one of these,
go like this...

100
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,899
...in here, and out it comes.

101
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:22,601
You got your 100.

102
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:26,138
I'll call you back.

103
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:29,041
No, it's decoy money.
It's marked.

104
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:30,576
It's shit.

105
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:35,214
See?

106
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,882
Cheer up, you'll be
the veterans of a robbery.

107
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:40,852
You know the bank
sends you a dozen red roses?

108
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:45,790
Sal, let him answer it.

109
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:48,493
Hey, you. Manager. Fucker!
Don't get ideas.

110
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,661
I bark, that man there, he bites.

111
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,396
- Believe me, I'm on your side.
- On my side, shit.

112
00:12:53,421 --> 00:13:00,446
Listen, we got young girls here.
You could watch your language.

113
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:03,173
I speak what I feel.

114
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:07,377
"Watch my language. "
Empty the drawer out.

115
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:10,513
I don't know.
You'd have to find out from him.

116
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:13,816
Traveler's checks...

117
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:16,585
...and the register.

118
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,955
The register.

119
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,093
You've got it.
All right, let's go.

120
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:26,995
I'll take that from you.

121
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,599
All right, Sal, here we go.

122
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:38,649
Shit.

123
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:48,615
Come on.

124
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,685
- Shit.
- Sonny, what the hell are you doing?

125
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:57,524
I'm burning the register here.

126
00:13:57,549 --> 00:13:59,959
Moving right along, folks.

127
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:03,129
All right. Okay.

128
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:06,732
We're leaving.
Let me have the keys.

129
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:10,002
Howard, give him the keys.

130
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:12,071
- Come on.
- Howard.

131
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:19,120
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
We're gonna leave.

132
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:22,681
Sonny. Who's that?

133
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:29,731
It's the insurance guy from across
the street. He probably saw the smoke.

134
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:42,576
Please, put out the fire.

135
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,409
- I'll get some water.
- Stay right there!

136
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,347
No, no, please, don't-! Don't do it!

137
00:14:57,372 --> 00:15:00,116
- I'll call you back later.
- Get rid of him.

138
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,253
- Come on, get rid of him!
- Howard.

139
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:10,302
Howard.

140
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:18,810
- Use your head.
- I can handle it.

141
00:15:21,127 --> 00:15:26,941
- Everything's all right?
- Cigarette butt got in the wastebasket.

142
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:30,411
- Well, then you're okay.
- Yeah. Thanks for keeping an eye out.

143
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:36,083
Okay.

144
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:38,251
- Good.
- Go now. We gave you all we've got.

145
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:40,253
Okay, we're going.

146
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:43,023
Answer the phone.
Sal, get them in the vault.

147
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:44,624
Come on, in the vault.

148
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:51,674
- Where's the money?
- I'm getting it. Got it.

149
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:56,735
He's gonna come with us. Okay.

150
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,805
No, please don't close that door.
How can we breathe?

151
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,041
- I can't explain. I'll call-
- Right.

152
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:03,776
Wait a minute.

153
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:05,578
- Wait a minute. Listen.
- What?

154
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:11,349
I'll never make this.
I'll have to go to the toilet.

155
00:16:11,374 --> 00:16:12,784
Honey, it's no joke.

156
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:19,834
I got a terrible fear
of being locked in.

157
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:23,261
- Who has to go to the bathroom?
- I do too.

158
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:27,164
- See, now they all wanna go.
- Look, do you wanna check it out?

159
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:32,602
It's the first door on your right.

160
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:37,174
All right, Mouth, let's go.

161
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,277
First door on my right.

162
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,979
It's Maria!

163
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:45,648
Listen, I- I forgot she's in there.
It's not her fault.

164
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,718
She's always pulling this.
She's supposed to have 10 minutes...

165
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:52,188
- ... she takes 15-
- Shut up! Nobody goes to the bathroom.

166
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:57,159
- Let's go, out.
- We're having a bank robbery.

167
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,160
Mulvaney speaking.

168
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,096
All right, Mouth. Mouth.

169
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,164
- Here's your toilet.
- It's for you.

170
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,335
- What?
- Telephone call.

171
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,385
For you.

172
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,258
Yeah.

173
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,559
- What are you doing in there?
- Who's this?

174
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:38,831
Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti,
asshole. We got you by the balls.

175
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:42,535
I'm looking you right in the eye.
Right now I can see you.

176
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:49,584
- Who is it?
- Cops.

177
00:18:05,614 --> 00:18:07,692
You come to the front door...

178
00:18:07,717 --> 00:18:14,742
Hang it up.

179
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:33,249
Get on the side of the street.

180
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:36,486
Come on, let's go.

181
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:39,421
How'd that happen?

182
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:42,591
Did I do anything to hurt you?
Did I treat you badly?

183
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:46,895
- Look at my salary. I won't be a hero.
- Did you have a plan or what?

184
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,732
What did you do,
just barge in on a whim?

185
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:52,801
- Why'd you have to light a fire?
- I told you to get out...

186
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:55,136
...when you could,
but you had to hang around.

187
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:57,338
He don't have a plan.
It's all a whim.

188
00:18:57,363 --> 00:19:00,141
- Rob a bank, right?
- I had it planned!

189
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,144
Only the money should have
been delivered, not taken away.

190
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:07,348
That fucking Jack, downtown, he gave
me the wrong information. That fuck!

191
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:10,784
What is this Jack supposed to be?
A mastermind or what?

192
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:12,419
I wouldn't be arguing with me.

193
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:18,925
We're all in a barrel together
and we wanna get out of it.

194
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,796
All right, I gotta have time to think.
I gotta think.

195
00:19:22,821 --> 00:19:29,845
Oh, shit.

196
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:44,382
Listen, bastards. You keep away,
or we'll start throwing bodies out...

197
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:49,454
...one at a time. Got that?

198
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:56,504
Who is this?

199
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:03,300
There a Jenny here?

200
00:20:03,325 --> 00:20:06,904
- Who's Jenny here?
- That's me.

201
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:09,873
It's the squirrel.
You got a husband?

202
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:14,178
Yeah? Well, he's on the phone.
Go ahead.

203
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:17,013
Well, what could I tell him?

204
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:19,715
I don't know, tell him whatever.
Tell him the truth.

205
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,019
What a fucking comedy.
W- N-E-W, plays all the hits.

206
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:25,321
Listen. Now, don't hang up.

207
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:27,890
- First off, is anybody hurt in there?
- No.

208
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:32,061
Keep away, or we'll start throwing
bodies out, one at a time. You got that?

209
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:35,730
Don't do that. Let me talk to you for
a while. How many people you got?

210
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:37,332
No, call me back.

211
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:40,835
- Call me back.
- Excuse me.

212
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,506
He said he wants to know
what time you'll be through.

213
00:20:44,531 --> 00:20:51,555
What? Oh, girlie, please.

214
00:20:54,974 --> 00:21:01,999
Come on. Let's go.

215
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:06,459
- Where's the back door?
- It's locked on the inside.

216
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:08,027
Where is it?

217
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:11,931
Through the passageway to the right.

218
00:21:11,956 --> 00:21:15,468
Sal, cover them, cover them.

219
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:22,517
You could just go ahead
and cook whatever's there.

220
00:21:24,568 --> 00:21:28,380
Ready for riot gang.
3-4, sergeant.

221
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:35,430
3-4, sergeant. Is that roof-?

222
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:50,001
- Negative.
- Tell units preset.

223
00:21:50,026 --> 00:21:53,671
Oh, yes, I will. Yes, I will.

224
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:57,307
- Let's go, come on.
- Honey, I've gotta go now.

225
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:59,776
I gotta go.

226
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:02,112
I love you too.

227
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:06,883
All right, inside here.

228
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,920
Sal, I don't know what happened.

229
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:14,189
Maybe somebody tripped an alarm
or something. I don't know.

230
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:16,792
- But there's a way out of this.
- Listen.

231
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:20,763
- Were you serious about what you said?
- About what?

232
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:25,634
About throwing-

233
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:31,105
About throwing those bodies
out the door?

234
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:38,155
- That's what I want him to think.
- I wanna know what you think.

235
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:43,617
Because I'll tell you right now,
I'm ready to do it.

236
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:46,186
Right. Okay.

237
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:50,924
- I mean it. I mean it.
- I know.

238
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,225
All right.

239
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,228
Listen, everybody.
I know we got a problem here, right?

240
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:58,231
But there's a way out of this thing.
I'm telling you.

241
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:01,067
All you gotta do is cooperate with me.

242
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:03,703
Stay cool, and we'll get out of this,
all right?

243
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:06,038
Nobody gets hurt if you listen to me.

244
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:10,343
First, we'll do things a step at a time.
You gotta go to the bathroom, right?

245
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:12,178
She'll get to go to the bathroom.

246
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:15,014
Everybody who has to go
will get to go to the bathroom.

247
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,015
We'll do things together.

248
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,885
Now, stay cool-
What's the matter with him?

249
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,988
He's got asthma.

250
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:30,038
- Asthma?
- Yeah, asthma.

251
00:23:34,923 --> 00:23:38,669
Asthma. Shit.

252
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:41,171
All right, I'll take care of that.

253
00:23:41,196 --> 00:23:42,973
- You, what's your name?
- Mulvaney.

254
00:23:42,998 --> 00:23:46,844
Mulvaney? Come with me.

255
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:50,046
- He's got asthma and he's a guard?
- They go to guard school.

256
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:52,782
To learn what, how to shoot?
He doesn't have a gun.

257
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:56,085
They earn a $105 a week
to fold the flag in the morning...

258
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,488
...straighten up.
I don't know what they learn.

259
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:03,259
All right, I wanna block that door. In
case they try coming in, I can hear it.

260
00:24:03,284 --> 00:24:09,264
All right. Let's move this.

261
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:13,268
Wait a minute. Hold it, hold it.

262
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:20,318
Let's get rid of this.

263
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,143
You got kids?

264
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:24,812
I got two kids and I'd like
to see them again.

265
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:27,715
You'll see them again.
You're being cooperative with me.

266
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,085
I got no complaints
against you, whatsoever.

267
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,954
Whatsoever.
You got bank insurance?

268
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:39,225
You know I do. You seem
to know a lot about bank procedure.

269
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,264
I know a lot about a lot of things.

270
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:49,135
I just wanna get you
out of here safe, right?

271
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,271
What if I take you with me?

272
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:53,039
If you take anybody...

273
00:24:53,064 --> 00:24:55,240
...please take me.

274
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:57,109
They'll shoot you, you know?

275
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:58,610
The cops...

276
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:02,948
...don't care about bank insurance.
See what they did in Attica?

277
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:08,287
Forty-two people, they killed.
The innocent with the guilty.

278
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:12,490
Anyway...

279
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:17,295
I won't take you. I'll take one of
them girls, a married one with kids.

280
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:24,345
Cops don't like it in the papers when
they shoot a married woman with kids.

281
00:25:25,294 --> 00:25:27,838
You're all right.

282
00:25:27,863 --> 00:25:34,888
You won't fuck with me, will you?

283
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:48,491
Come on, set a car.

284
00:25:48,516 --> 00:25:55,541
- Help with those barricades.
- Move them back.

285
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:04,639
There's the FBl.

286
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:11,689
How you doing, Sheldon?

287
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:31,565
Why didn't you wait
and try to take them outside?

288
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,133
I made an error in judgment.

289
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,769
Thought the S.O.B.s would be
remorseful at the sight of a policeman.

290
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:43,819
And you know something?
Nobody said "hostage" yet, understand?

291
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:48,681
- We have a bank robbery here.
- Yeah.

292
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:55,730
How did the press guys
get through the barrier?

293
00:26:57,547 --> 00:27:01,092
We don't know what's up yet.
We're setting up communications.

294
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:04,563
This is Ron Cummins from CBS.
Can you tell me the situation?

295
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:08,165
We got the- We're setting up
communications now.

296
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,034
The perpetrators are in the bank.

297
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:11,669
That's all I can say now.

298
00:27:11,694 --> 00:27:15,806
When I get it, you'll get it.
That's all. Okay.

299
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:18,075
What are you doing
on the fire escape?

300
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:25,124
I said on the roof.
Now, get up on the roof, will you?

301
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:12,792
- Get the phone company?
- It's being set up now.

302
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:19,842
This phone is gonna be
a direct line into the bank.

303
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:28,141
- Mulvaney speaking.
- Moretti here. Let me talk to him.

304
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,110
- Yeah.
- Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti.

305
00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:33,145
- Yeah.
- Okay...

306
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,814
...you're in there, we're out here.
What do we do?

307
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,317
- I don't know. What do we do?
- Listen.

308
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:42,121
- Are the people in the bank okay?
- They're okay.

309
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:47,525
- You alone or you got confederates?
- I'm not alone.

310
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,461
- I got Sal.
- Sal, what's that for, Salvatore?

311
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:53,164
Yeah. Sal, he's a killer.

312
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,634
We're Vietnam veterans
so killing don't mean anything to us.

313
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:58,569
- In the Army?
- In the Army, yeah.

314
00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:03,807
- So there's you, what's your name?
- Why do you wanna know my name?

315
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:10,857
Give me any name.
Just so I got something to call you.

316
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:19,322
Let's be reasonable, okay?
Just give me your name.

317
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:20,523
Call me Sonny.

318
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:22,024
- Sonny?
- Yeah.

319
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,859
Okay. Now listen, Sonny.

320
00:29:23,884 --> 00:29:26,028
I wanna see
if the people are okay.

321
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:27,596
- Right.
- Yeah.

322
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:30,399
Then I wanna work out a way
to get them out of there.

323
00:29:30,424 --> 00:29:32,601
I wanna come over without a gun.

324
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:36,004
You can frisk me so you can trust me.
We'll find a way out of this.

325
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:37,305
Right.

326
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:41,810
I just wanna find some way
that I can trust you too.

327
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:44,546
Not be on the street
where you could just shoot me.

328
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:47,315
- Some sign, right?
- Right. Like what?

329
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,217
How about letting the people out?

330
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:53,187
Come on, now. Who do you think you're
dealing with? A fucking idiot here?

331
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:55,689
They're keeping me alive.
I'm gonna let them out?

332
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:58,525
Talk to me. Just talk to me straight.
I'm ready to talk.

333
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,628
Okay, okay.
How about giving us the women?

334
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:04,098
No, I've got women.
That's all I've got here.

335
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:06,833
Okay. Give me something.
Give me one of them.

336
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:09,402
- Why do you want one?
- It's like a fair exchange.

337
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:11,704
- I'll come over. I won't pack nothing.
- Yeah?

338
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:15,108
I don't know if you'll take me hostage.
It's a sign of trust.

339
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:18,578
- How do I call you back?
- We got a direct line here.

340
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:22,849
Pick up the receiver and I'm here.

341
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:28,086
He wants one.

342
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:31,123
- Him, right?
- Right.

343
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:32,357
- Right?
- Right.

344
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:35,394
- Okay? He goes.
- Okay.

345
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:39,864
Can you get up?

346
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:43,868
What are we dealing with here?

347
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:47,071
Hey, you have to keep
checking me out all the time?

348
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,639
Yeah.

349
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:53,377
- Here you are. Your stomach okay?
- It's all right.

350
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:55,613
He'll need the keys.

351
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:58,681
Got the keys?

352
00:30:58,706 --> 00:31:05,731
- Just the one, Sonny!
- Right.

353
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:18,967
- Hey, don't fire! Don't fire!
- What are you doing?

354
00:31:18,992 --> 00:31:23,138
- Get away from him!
- That's a hostage!

355
00:31:23,163 --> 00:31:26,475
- Don't fire, don't fire. Hold your fire.
- Hold your fire!

356
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,477
We voted to send him out!

357
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:32,180
- He's one of the hostages!
- Get away from him!

358
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:34,916
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a hostage!

359
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:38,653
He's one of the hostages.
What the hell's the matter with you?

360
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:43,424
I don't give a fuck, goddamn it!
Get away. Get out of here.

361
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,525
Hey, Sonny! Wait a minute, Sonny.

362
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,028
That was your fault, Sonny.

363
00:31:48,053 --> 00:31:50,831
You know we had
the communications set up here.

364
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:53,967
We're not set up properly.
We've got 250 cops here.

365
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:56,036
We don't know
what's going on in there.

366
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:59,439
- You almost killed him! Are you crazy?
- That was smart.

367
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:04,443
You say you got nothing but women,
and throw out a guy. What's going on?

368
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:06,545
You wanted a hostage,
I gave you one.

369
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,882
- You gonna deal with us or not?
- I gave you one.

370
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:13,352
You did, but you should have picked up
the phone. Come on out.

371
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:16,655
Look. I ain't packing nothing, see?

372
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,189
I ain't packing nothing.

373
00:32:18,214 --> 00:32:23,561
You can come out and frisk me.
You can tell.

374
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:27,098
- Why you want me to come out?
- To look at something.

375
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:30,401
- To see what you're up against.
- I can see it. Why come out?

376
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:34,272
Come out and see it all, all right?
Come on.

377
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:36,273
All right?

378
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:41,278
Sal is in there with the other people.
Anything happens to me, they'll get it.

379
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:44,615
I don't forget about Sal.
Come out and look. Okay?

380
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,050
Come on. Okay?

381
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:54,099
- I gotta check with him first.
- All right. You don't need that artillery.

382
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,898
Sonny, five minutes.
You tell him that.

383
00:33:01,923 --> 00:33:03,900
Take it easy.

384
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:06,235
Get them back.
He's got a white flag.

385
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,303
All right. Okay.
Everything's all right.

386
00:33:08,328 --> 00:33:12,540
- See that?
- Right, yeah. Okay.

387
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:15,544
- Come on out, Sonny.
- He's too close here.

388
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,512
Get back!
What the fuck are you doing?

389
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,214
- Get them back.
- Get back!

390
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:22,617
- All right.
- Okay. Come on out.

391
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:25,286
Take a look at this. Come on.

392
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:28,055
Here, look. Look up here. Look.

393
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,624
Look.

394
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:36,730
Look over here, huh?

395
00:33:36,755 --> 00:33:43,779
Over there, right?
We got everything here, okay?

396
00:33:57,874 --> 00:34:04,899
You got the militia out here, huh?

397
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:12,164
Let Sal come look.
What hope have you got?

398
00:34:12,189 --> 00:34:14,198
Come on. Quit while you're ahead.

399
00:34:14,223 --> 00:34:16,867
- It's only attempted robbery.
- Armed robbery.

400
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:19,570
All right, armed, then.
Nobody's been hurt.

401
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:23,341
Release the hostages. No one
will worry over kidnapping charges.

402
00:34:23,366 --> 00:34:25,009
The most you'll get is 5 years.

403
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:26,978
- You'll get out in one year.
- Kiss me.

404
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:29,313
- What?
- Kiss me.

405
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:32,482
When I'm being fucked,
I like to get kissed on the mouth.

406
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:35,585
You're a city cop, right?
Bank robbery's a federal offense.

407
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,989
They got me on kidnapping, armed
robbery. They're gonna bury me.

408
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:41,157
I won't talk to somebody
trying to con me.

409
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:43,193
- Get someone in charge.
- I am in charge.

410
00:34:43,218 --> 00:34:47,196
I won't talk to some flunky pig
trying to con me. What's he doing?

411
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:49,198
- Get back!
- Why are they moving in?

412
00:34:49,223 --> 00:34:53,535
Will you get the fuck back there?
Get back there. Get over there!

413
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,971
- Go on back there, man!
- Get over there!

414
00:34:55,996 --> 00:34:58,340
He wants to kill me so bad,
he can taste it.

415
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:02,310
- No one's gonna kill anybody.
- Attica! Attica! Attica!

416
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:06,014
Attica! Attica! Attica!

417
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:09,817
Attica! Attica!

418
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:13,554
Attica! Attica! Attica!

419
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,390
Attica!

420
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:22,229
Attica! Remember Attica!

421
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:26,667
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Your word don't fucking matter!

422
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:32,639
Come on, calm down.

423
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,708
...to put their guns down!

424
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,275
Put your guns down!

425
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,580
Wasn't for the TV guys,
they'd kill us all.

426
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:44,050
Tell them to put their guns down!
Get back!

427
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:46,152
- Put those guns down!
- Put the guns down!

428
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,921
Get back!
Put those fucking guns down!

429
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:52,057
Put those guns down!

430
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:55,060
Put them down! Put them down!

431
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:57,696
Put those fucking guns down.

432
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:02,967
Put those guns down.

433
00:36:02,992 --> 00:36:10,016
Attica! Attica!

434
00:36:15,971 --> 00:36:19,116
You got it, man!
You got it, man!

435
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:22,252
You got it, man!

436
00:36:22,277 --> 00:36:26,889
You got it! You got it!

437
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:31,327
You got it, man! You got it, right?
You got it, right?

438
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:36,065
You got it. You got it.
You got it, right?

439
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,102
- headquarters in Washington-
- Robbing a bank?

440
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:42,104
- What was-? What?
- as to the identity of one of the men.

441
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:45,707
Why didn't he tell me
he needed money?

442
00:36:45,732 --> 00:36:50,812
He should've come to me
if he needed money.

443
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:53,148
I can't believe it.

444
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:57,751
We know that 8 people
are still being held in the bank.

445
00:36:57,776 --> 00:37:01,856
The situation inside the bank
is totally unknown to us other than...

446
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:05,926
...descriptions that have been
obtained from Howard Calvin.

447
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:08,329
Why steal when your mom's a sucker?

448
00:37:08,354 --> 00:37:13,000
We'll switch you now to Ron Cummins
at the bank in Brooklyn.

449
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:15,602
Miss Benson, what's it like inside?

450
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:17,670
They're holding up,
what can you say?

451
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:20,140
- The guy with the gun on us...
- Got a deal?

452
00:37:20,165 --> 00:37:24,777
- ... he's a quiet type.
- Any confidence in Detective Moretti?

453
00:37:24,802 --> 00:37:29,482
They don't know Detective Moretti yet.
I gotta go now.

454
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:31,817
What's this with the hands?

455
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:33,752
She's out, let her stay out.

456
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:40,802
They're my girls.
I'm going back in there.

457
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,501
- Howard, how is he?
- Howard's all right.

458
00:37:50,526 --> 00:37:53,671
- Put the TV on.
- Girls, I was interviewed.

459
00:37:53,696 --> 00:37:57,642
Sal, looks good.

460
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,077
Everybody's out there.
They got the whole media.

461
00:38:00,102 --> 00:38:02,380
Television people. Television people...

462
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:09,429
...they wanna talk to you.
They're out there.

463
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:12,589
Yeah?

464
00:38:12,614 --> 00:38:15,559
Hello, Sonny.
Sonny, you're on the air.

465
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:19,095
- Would you answer a few questions?
- Yeah.

466
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:25,301
Why are you doing this?

467
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:27,002
- Hello?
- See, now...

468
00:38:27,027 --> 00:38:29,104
...I just saw myself there.
What'd you-?

469
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:31,040
- Why am I doing it?
- Yes.

470
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:38,089
- Doing what?
- Robbing a bank.

471
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:41,182
What? I don't know
what you mean by that.

472
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:44,118
I'm robbing a bank
because they got money here.

473
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:47,422
I mean, why do you feel
you have to steal for money?

474
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:50,925
Couldn't you get a job?

475
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,527
No. Doing what?

476
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:57,898
You know- You know, if you want a
job, you gotta be a member of a union.

477
00:38:57,923 --> 00:39:01,435
See. If you got no union card,
you don't get a job.

478
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:06,240
What about non-union jobs?

479
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:08,075
What's wrong with this guy?

480
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,943
What do you mean, non-union?
Like what, a bank teller?

481
00:39:10,968 --> 00:39:13,279
- Know how much a bank teller makes?
- Not much.

482
00:39:13,304 --> 00:39:17,917
Not much. $115 to start, right?
You gonna live on that?

483
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:22,421
I got a wife and kids. How am I gonna
live on that? What do you make a week?

484
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:26,091
- I'm here to talk to you, Sonny.
- No, well, I'm- I'm talking to you.

485
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:29,794
We're entertainment, right?
What do you-? What do you got for us?

486
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:31,930
What do you want to get for it?

487
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:36,234
- Do you expect to be paid?
- I don't need to be paid. Look.

488
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:40,438
I'm here with my partner and nine
other people, see, and we're dying.

489
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:44,074
You're gonna see our brains on the
sidewalk. They'll spill our guts out.

490
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:45,809
Gonna show that on television?

491
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:48,746
Have housewives see that?
Instead of As The World Turns?

492
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:51,282
What do you got for me?
I want something for that.

493
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:52,516
- Sonny.
- Yeah.

494
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:55,386
- You could give up.
- Give up?

495
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:57,787
- Right. You ever been in prison?
- No.

496
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,090
No. Let's talk about something
you fucking know about, okay?

497
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:05,128
- How much you make a week?
- Transmission has been interrupted.

498
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,898
Please stand by, we will return
to our special newscast very soon.

499
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:14,003
Hello? What the fuck happened?

500
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:18,173
Guess he didn't appreciate
your language.

501
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:25,223
Fuck him.

502
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,218
Sal.

503
00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:37,267
Sal.

504
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:51,237
I don't know,
they might deal with us.

505
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:54,674
You know? I mean, I don't know about
that guy out there.

506
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:59,379
But if I get the FBl involved in this,
they might deal.

507
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:06,428
What do you think?

508
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,557
No.

509
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:13,325
- Sal...
- No!

510
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,462
- What's the matter with you?
- You made a promise, didn't you?

511
00:41:16,487 --> 00:41:18,397
- Did you promise me something?
- Yeah.

512
00:41:18,422 --> 00:41:22,400
Did you say either we get away clean
or we kill ourselves?

513
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:25,370
- Did you?
- I'm not talking about that.

514
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,672
- You believe in keeping your promises?
- Yeah.

515
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:29,540
- Then does it still go?
- Yeah.

516
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:35,213
- Well, what are you talking about?
- I'm trying to-

517
00:41:35,238 --> 00:41:42,262
I ain't going back
to that prison, Sonny.

518
00:41:42,577 --> 00:41:44,888
- Yeah.
- Kill them all. Now.

519
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:51,938
- Take your bayonet, jam it into their-
- Fuck you, you fucker.

520
00:42:00,628 --> 00:42:07,653
Shit.

521
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:33,176
We ask for a jet.
What do you think?

522
00:42:35,194 --> 00:42:37,404
We get a helicopter.

523
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,308
We get a helicopter here,
it lands on the roof...

524
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:47,113
...and takes us to a jet.
And we fly the fuck out of the country.

525
00:42:47,138 --> 00:42:50,983
Sal. Sal...

526
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:57,423
...we can do it.

527
00:42:57,448 --> 00:43:00,158
Sal. Sal, look.

528
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:04,663
We got them. We don't even know it.
We got the hostages.

529
00:43:04,688 --> 00:43:08,767
We've been looking at this the
wrong way. We make the demands.

530
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:15,816
They're gonna give us
anything we want.

531
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:24,491
I'm flying to the tropics.
Fuck the snow.

532
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:29,286
Hey, where's the Mouth?

533
00:43:29,311 --> 00:43:33,990
- You ready to go to Algeria?
- Algeria? Yeah, sure.

534
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,892
We're all going to sunny climes!

535
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:39,796
Sal, I can make it happen!
I can make it happen!

536
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:46,846
I made it happen so far, right?
I can make it happen.

537
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,808
- Yeah.
- Give me Moretti.

538
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:55,544
Sarge.

539
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:59,515
All of you, go ahead, make phone calls.
Call home or whatever.

540
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,116
We're all going on a trip.

541
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:03,685
- Yeah, Sonny.
- Yeah. I wanna talk to you.

542
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,988
- And I'm coming out.
- Good, I'll be there.

543
00:44:07,013 --> 00:44:08,923
Let's go. Come on, he's coming out.

544
00:44:08,948 --> 00:44:10,658
Sal.

545
00:44:10,683 --> 00:44:13,561
Now, you gotta understand something.

546
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:17,932
If we leave the country,
there's no coming back here.

547
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:19,567
There's no coming back.

548
00:44:19,592 --> 00:44:22,135
If there's anyone you wanna talk to...

549
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:29,185
...you wanna say goodbye to,
do it now.

550
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,845
No.

551
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,413
No.

552
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:39,218
Is there any special country
you wanna go to?

553
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,755
Wyoming.

554
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,859
No, Wyoming...
That's not a country.

555
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:53,908
That's all right.
I'll take care of it.

556
00:45:12,307 --> 00:45:17,754
All right, put them down!

557
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:21,124
Put them down. You need a gun?
What do I have?

558
00:45:21,149 --> 00:45:24,695
See this here, look.
I got nothing up my sleeve.

559
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,798
I got nothing here either.
Wanna see my pockets? Here.

560
00:45:28,823 --> 00:45:33,236
You need that gun, right? Yeah.

561
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:36,505
Moretti, tell them
to put their guns down!

562
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:43,554
Hey, you, see that?
Put it in your holster.

563
00:45:44,604 --> 00:45:48,583
Put the guns down!

564
00:45:48,608 --> 00:45:52,487
You know what it means
to put a gun down? What's this?

565
00:45:52,512 --> 00:45:55,156
- What's this?
- Put them down.

566
00:45:55,181 --> 00:45:59,426
Right. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

567
00:45:59,451 --> 00:46:02,863
You got it, right?

568
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:05,132
You got it, baby! Hey, Moretti!

569
00:46:05,157 --> 00:46:12,182
You ready to let these-?

570
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:17,110
You got Maria in there!

571
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:19,812
Maria!

572
00:46:19,837 --> 00:46:24,817
He's got a gun in there! Maria!

573
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:28,688
Maria! Maria!

574
00:46:28,713 --> 00:46:31,990
Get him the fuck out of here!

575
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:33,859
How the hell did that happen?

576
00:46:33,884 --> 00:46:36,361
- I got Sal in there!
- Take it easy.

577
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:39,798
- Notify the precinct, all right?
- Who the fuck is that?

578
00:46:39,823 --> 00:46:42,034
No, no, no.
He's one of them Spanish kids.

579
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:43,769
- Who's Maria?
- She's inside.

580
00:46:43,794 --> 00:46:46,571
Sal wants to see Sonny,
says he'll shoot unless he does.

581
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:49,840
- Sal. Sal.
- He's serious. Sonny, he means it!

582
00:46:49,865 --> 00:46:53,844
- He means it.
- It's all right. It's all right.

583
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:57,915
It's all right.

584
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,384
- Hey, man, I'm sorry.
- How'd that happen?

585
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:03,187
You got his girlfriend.
You know the Spanish. You okay?

586
00:47:03,212 --> 00:47:05,288
That fuck tried to kill me.

587
00:47:05,313 --> 00:47:08,291
- You look all squeezed out.
- Squeezed out, I'm squeezed out.

588
00:47:08,316 --> 00:47:11,428
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Wait, let me see.
Let me see your head.

589
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:14,097
- I'm bleeding.
- Let me see it.

590
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,598
Let me see it.

591
00:47:15,623 --> 00:47:21,070
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

592
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:24,873
It's all right. You want to
talk to me about something?

593
00:47:24,898 --> 00:47:27,076
You should've heard that phone call.

594
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:29,545
Calls up, some creep,
says, "Kill everybody. "

595
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,613
Everybody wants to kill everybody.

596
00:47:31,638 --> 00:47:34,416
You're gonna get assholes like that
anyhow, right?

597
00:47:34,441 --> 00:47:39,821
Right.

598
00:47:39,846 --> 00:47:43,758
Yeah, I wanna talk to you.
I got an offer.

599
00:47:43,783 --> 00:47:46,928
I want a helicopter out of here.

600
00:47:46,953 --> 00:47:50,398
And a jet to go wherever I wanna go.

601
00:47:50,423 --> 00:47:52,934
So I don't want a little jet,
I want a big one.

602
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:56,536
One with a bar, a piano.
Maybe I wanna go out of the country.

603
00:47:56,561 --> 00:48:00,707
I don't know, Sonny. I don't know
whether a helicopter'll fit in here or not.

604
00:48:00,732 --> 00:48:02,042
I'll check it out.

605
00:48:02,067 --> 00:48:04,478
- It could land on the roof.
- No, that's asphalt.

606
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:06,780
You know what'll happen,
it'll break through.

607
00:48:06,805 --> 00:48:09,750
I'll call my superiors, you understand?

608
00:48:09,775 --> 00:48:12,084
Why don't you
bring your superiors here?

609
00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:15,154
Why am I talking to you
if you gotta call your superiors?

610
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:18,991
- We don't always see eye-to-eye.
- Yeah, so I'll talk to them.

611
00:48:19,016 --> 00:48:20,593
I'll see what they say.

612
00:48:20,618 --> 00:48:23,996
I talk to them and I ask them,
all right? Then we'll see.

613
00:48:24,021 --> 00:48:29,300
Anything else I can give you?

614
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:32,804
Yeah, I want you to bring
my wife down here.

615
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:35,874
- What do you give us?
- What do you want?

616
00:48:35,899 --> 00:48:38,977
The women hostages.

617
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:41,913
Oh, man. You know,
there's no talking to you.

618
00:48:41,938 --> 00:48:45,482
That's all I got in there,
I told you, is women.

619
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:49,386
You gonna talk to me or what?

620
00:48:49,411 --> 00:48:52,389
I'll give you one hostage
for each thing you give me, see?

621
00:48:52,414 --> 00:48:54,658
Give me the helicopter,
I give you a hostage.

622
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,760
Give me the jet, I give you a hostage.

623
00:48:56,785 --> 00:48:59,529
You give me my wife,
I give you a hostage.

624
00:48:59,554 --> 00:49:03,933
Then the rest come home on the jet.

625
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:06,536
I'll see what they'll do, all right?

626
00:49:06,561 --> 00:49:09,605
In the meantime, you pick out
who you wanna give us.

627
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:13,042
And you tell me where
your wife is, all right?

628
00:49:13,067 --> 00:49:17,212
I'm here minding my own business,
I hear the transistor, go, "Sonny what?"

629
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:19,714
I can't believe my ears.
I grab the kids.

630
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:23,351
I'm telling you, Sonny didn't do it.
It ain't him to rob a bank!

631
00:49:23,376 --> 00:49:27,155
It ain't him to steal or hurt anybody
or do nothing wrong!

632
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,058
He's never done wrong
since the day I know him.

633
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:34,195
Night before last we're at Coney Island.
I'm looking in the glove compartment.

634
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,363
He's got a gun with bullets in it.

635
00:49:36,388 --> 00:49:39,200
Things are adding up
how crazy he's acting lately...

636
00:49:39,225 --> 00:49:42,536
...and in with a bad crowd.
So I look at him.

637
00:49:42,561 --> 00:49:45,573
Go on, get in bed. He's yelling
at the kids like a madman.

638
00:49:45,598 --> 00:49:49,075
Then he wants me to go on a
kiddie ride. I don't wanna go.

639
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,178
He starts screaming at me.
Sweetheart.

640
00:49:52,203 --> 00:49:55,148
He's screaming and screaming.

641
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:58,151
I say, "What are you
gonna do with the gun?

642
00:49:58,176 --> 00:50:00,486
Shoot me and dump me in the river?"

643
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:03,857
I mean, I was scared of him.
I never been scared of him.

644
00:50:03,882 --> 00:50:07,893
His mother says we was always fighting,
the cops was always at our house.

645
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:11,730
I hit him with a jack handle
once in the car.

646
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:13,966
Only I didn't even hit him,
I hit myself.

647
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:17,002
You should've seen the bruise
on my leg, from here to here.

648
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:22,473
He'd put on his hat and coat,
he goes out the door.

649
00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:25,977
So they tell me he did it.
But I don't believe it.

650
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:29,747
Mrs. Wortzik, please, listen to me.
They want you down at the bank.

651
00:50:29,772 --> 00:50:36,797
His body functions might've done it,
but he himself, he didn't do it!

652
00:50:41,783 --> 00:50:46,296
"Dear Abby: Lately I've been dreaming
about falling into water...

653
00:50:46,321 --> 00:50:49,900
...and not being able
to reach the surface.

654
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:54,204
I begin to breathe heavily
and I wake up in a cold sweat.

655
00:50:54,229 --> 00:50:59,608
A friend tells me that my problem
is one of sexual repression. "

656
00:50:59,633 --> 00:51:02,745
- Margaret, are you all right?
- No.

657
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:06,815
What are you, a renegade, a bandit?
What kind of man are you...

658
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,752
...siding with the Indians
against his own people?

659
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:16,801
- What's your grudge against me?
- I'm taking you in for murder, Kilgore.

660
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:20,528
Yeah?

661
00:51:20,553 --> 00:51:24,565
Are you doing anything
to any of those girls in there?

662
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,467
He's back again.

663
00:51:27,492 --> 00:51:31,838
Well?

664
00:51:31,863 --> 00:51:35,142
Who is this?

665
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:39,980
Look at Margaret.

666
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:42,449
What's the matter with her?

667
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:48,454
There's no air in here.

668
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:55,504
What happened to the air conditioning?

669
00:51:56,153 --> 00:52:00,966
- I'm sorry, Syl.
- It's all right.

670
00:52:00,991 --> 00:52:08,016
- Where's the air conditioning?
- The basement.

671
00:52:08,865 --> 00:52:12,444
Sal, I'm gonna go
check the air conditioning.

672
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:19,493
- I'll be right back.
- Sonny.

673
00:52:20,342 --> 00:52:23,153
What?

674
00:52:23,178 --> 00:52:30,203
I never been up in an airplane before.

675
00:52:30,686 --> 00:52:33,896
So? I mean-

676
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:40,870
I mean, it's safe. It's like a car.
It's safer than a car.

677
00:52:40,895 --> 00:52:47,920
It's all right, Sal.

678
00:52:48,403 --> 00:52:55,427
- I'm gonna go check it now.
- Okay.

679
00:53:15,461 --> 00:53:16,737
- Sal!
- What?

680
00:53:16,762 --> 00:53:21,442
- They're coming in the back!
- In the vault! Come on.

681
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:23,276
- Goddamn it, move!
- Back, get back.

682
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:30,326
No, don't shoot!

683
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:36,089
That's it, Sonny! Get her in there!
Do it!

684
00:53:36,114 --> 00:53:39,091
Get her in there!

685
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:42,294
Who fired that shot?

686
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,964
Pick her up by the legs.

687
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:49,068
Who fired the shot?

688
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:51,170
Come on! Move!

689
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:54,073
Okay, legs. I'll bring her.

690
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:58,543
- They're moving good.
- What's that?

691
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,978
Sonny?

692
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:07,452
Sonny! Get me a bullhorn.

693
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:12,923
Sonny!

694
00:54:12,948 --> 00:54:19,930
- You got that bullhorn?
- Right. Here.

695
00:54:19,955 --> 00:54:23,567
Hey, Sonny.

696
00:54:23,592 --> 00:54:26,937
Come on out, Sonny.

697
00:54:26,962 --> 00:54:29,071
- Sonny.
- Sonny!

698
00:54:29,096 --> 00:54:32,908
That's all I need.

699
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:35,277
- Sonny?
- Sonny!

700
00:54:35,302 --> 00:54:38,447
Come on, take care of that, will you?

701
00:54:38,472 --> 00:54:40,916
- Sonny, come on out.
- Sonny, come on out.

702
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:44,586
Go straighten that out,
will you, Carmine? Sonny!

703
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:48,356
Sonny, come on out.

704
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:50,792
- Sonny?
- You did fine.

705
00:54:50,817 --> 00:54:55,730
Sonny.

706
00:54:55,755 --> 00:54:56,931
Sonny!

707
00:54:56,956 --> 00:55:00,468
You son of a bitch,
you wanna get those people killed?

708
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:05,873
Come on out, Sonny.

709
00:55:05,898 --> 00:55:11,845
Sonny, come on out.

710
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:16,450
Come on out here, now.

711
00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:23,499
Come on out, Sonny. Sonny!

712
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:27,994
Sonny?

713
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:31,964
Come on out here, Sonny.

714
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:34,065
All right, I see it, Sonny. Come on.

715
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:40,906
Come on. All right, get back.

716
00:55:40,931 --> 00:55:47,345
Wait, wait. People, wait.

717
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:51,282
Keep going.

718
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:53,551
What's the matter with you?

719
00:55:53,576 --> 00:55:56,387
- What?
- What're you firing that shot for?

720
00:55:56,412 --> 00:55:58,155
We got 250 cops here!

721
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,658
Fuck you! What were
they doing back there?

722
00:56:00,683 --> 00:56:03,861
What the hell's the matter with you?

723
00:56:03,886 --> 00:56:05,329
Are we dealing?

724
00:56:05,354 --> 00:56:07,564
- They were trying to get in, right?
- Who?

725
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:10,200
Come on, don't give me that shit.
You know who.

726
00:56:10,225 --> 00:56:12,368
- What's going on?
- You're full of shit!

727
00:56:12,393 --> 00:56:14,671
Find out what's going on there!

728
00:56:14,696 --> 00:56:17,574
- Honest to God, Sonny, I don't know-
- Bullshit!

729
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,742
Communications aren't set up yet.

730
00:56:19,767 --> 00:56:22,312
- Get someone to talk to me!
- Goddamn it.

731
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,446
I'm not talking to you anymore.

732
00:56:24,471 --> 00:56:27,115
- Let me talk to you.
- You say this, you do that.

733
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,717
Why were they back there?!

734
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:31,220
- I don't know!
- You're full of shit.

735
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:33,355
That's another force, a tactical force!

736
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,124
They like to shoot,
climb through windows!

737
00:56:36,149 --> 00:56:39,327
They like that, right?
Without your orders, right?

738
00:56:39,352 --> 00:56:41,062
No. Yes! Without my orders!

739
00:56:41,087 --> 00:56:43,965
- You're not coming through the roof?
- I tell you we won't.

740
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,702
You're telling me a lot of things,
but you're not doing them.

741
00:56:47,727 --> 00:56:49,237
What were they doing?!

742
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:51,606
- I don't know!
- You can't answer me, right?

743
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:53,341
- You can't answer me.
- What?

744
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:55,109
- You can't answer me.
- Yes, I can.

745
00:56:55,134 --> 00:56:57,444
So tell me what they were doing.

746
00:56:57,469 --> 00:57:00,213
No communications!
I sent someone back there.

747
00:57:00,238 --> 00:57:04,251
I got a guy in there who's gonna kill
somebody. That's your responsibility.

748
00:57:04,276 --> 00:57:07,120
- Not mine, that's yours.
- Wait a minute, hold on. Let's-

749
00:57:07,145 --> 00:57:09,222
- We got everything you wanted.
- Oh, yeah?

750
00:57:09,247 --> 00:57:12,758
Yeah. We can't get a helicopter in here,
but a bus is coming.

751
00:57:12,783 --> 00:57:15,761
We got a jet coming into Kennedy,
all right?

752
00:57:15,786 --> 00:57:19,932
Okay? All right?

753
00:57:19,957 --> 00:57:22,601
Now, we got ahold of your wife.

754
00:57:22,626 --> 00:57:24,169
Your wife is coming.

755
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:27,006
We reached her
and she's coming here, all right?

756
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:29,674
- Okay?
- Where you going? Where you going?

757
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:32,677
I'm right here.
I thought we were gonna talk.

758
00:57:32,702 --> 00:57:34,779
I thought so too.
But we're not talking.

759
00:57:34,804 --> 00:57:36,914
We're trying to get in the back door.

760
00:57:36,939 --> 00:57:40,585
Your wife will be here
in about a half-hour. Okay?

761
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,887
They're still pointing.
They love to point.

762
00:57:42,912 --> 00:57:45,656
Holster that weapon!
Holster it!

763
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:47,958
Holster that weapon!

764
00:57:47,983 --> 00:57:51,461
You too!

765
00:57:51,486 --> 00:57:52,996
All right, come on.

766
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:55,432
- What?
- What else do you want me to do?

767
00:57:55,457 --> 00:57:58,035
How could you do any better?

768
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,603
We got everything you wanted.

769
00:57:59,628 --> 00:58:04,607
I'll do anything I can
to stop anything I can.

770
00:58:04,632 --> 00:58:06,142
Anything else?

771
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:07,977
- Yeah.
- What?

772
00:58:08,002 --> 00:58:10,646
I got some people
in there that are hungry.

773
00:58:10,671 --> 00:58:13,649
- Can you get some food?
- No problem. What do you want?

774
00:58:13,674 --> 00:58:15,484
- Want some pizzas?
- Yeah, all right.

775
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:16,719
Pizzas?

776
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:20,855
Hey, Carmine, get some food,
some pizzas.

777
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,024
Can we get some beer, you think?

778
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:26,061
No beer.
Let's keep it to soft drinks, all right?

779
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,663
Come on. All right? Carmine...

780
00:58:28,688 --> 00:58:31,533
...some soft drinks too, okay?
Cokes.

781
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:33,668
- What else?
- I need some aspirin too.

782
00:58:33,693 --> 00:58:35,836
Some lady's not feeling well.

783
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:38,339
You got it. Anything else?

784
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:42,042
- Just don't fucking con me.
- I'm not. Why would I wanna do that?

785
00:58:42,067 --> 00:58:46,680
I'm in trouble enough as it is.
I'm not trying to create any trouble.

786
00:58:46,705 --> 00:58:53,729
All right?

787
00:58:55,513 --> 00:59:00,860
It's okay.

788
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:04,230
They can't- They can't bring
a helicopter in here, Sal.

789
00:59:04,255 --> 00:59:06,232
Because they can't land it here.

790
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:09,768
But they're gonna get us a limo bus-
A big bus so we can all get in.

791
00:59:09,793 --> 00:59:12,904
And that's how we get to the airport.

792
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:17,476
It's good. It looks good.

793
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:21,680
You people,
I just ordered you some food, so...

794
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:23,914
I even got her some aspirins.

795
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:26,517
Okay? So we're moving it along now.

796
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:29,987
I gotta pay for the food.
Where's the marked fives?

797
00:59:30,012 --> 00:59:34,492
That was a foolish thing
you did back there.

798
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:40,030
Yeah? Foolish thing.

799
00:59:40,055 --> 00:59:42,365
We gonna get the ball rolling?

800
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,801
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?

801
00:59:44,826 --> 00:59:47,137
I'm working on it, right?
What's it look like?

802
00:59:47,162 --> 00:59:49,773
You think it's easy?
I gotta keep them cool.

803
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:51,775
I gotta keep all you people happy.

804
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,210
I gotta have all the ideas
and do it all alone.

805
00:59:54,235 --> 00:59:56,445
I'm working on it.
You wanna try it?

806
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:00,382
Your food is here, Sonny.

807
01:00:00,407 --> 01:00:07,432
You're starting to get on my nerves.

808
01:00:10,951 --> 01:00:17,975
All right. Go on with him there.
You'll be all right. Go right here.

809
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:20,902
- What do I owe you?
- It's all paid for.

810
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:22,537
- It's paid for.
- I paid for it.

811
01:00:22,562 --> 01:00:24,672
No, I got it. I got it.

812
01:00:24,697 --> 01:00:30,811
Here. Keep the change.

813
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:34,648
What?

814
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:39,820
- You want this?
- Yeah!

815
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:46,869
You like it?

816
01:00:51,088 --> 01:00:58,113
Moretti, could you use five?

817
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:08,556
I got a lot for you.

818
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:14,385
Get back!

819
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:19,590
Get back, goddamn it! Get back!

820
01:01:19,615 --> 01:01:26,640
Let him go. Let him go.

821
01:01:34,263 --> 01:01:38,241
More! More! More!

822
01:01:38,266 --> 01:01:45,291
More! More! More!

823
01:01:46,574 --> 01:01:50,019
Could you open it?

824
01:01:50,044 --> 01:01:52,220
Thank you, man.

825
01:01:52,245 --> 01:01:56,157
See you later.

826
01:01:56,182 --> 01:02:03,207
I'm a fucking star!

827
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:24,250
- Okay, kick...
- Right.

828
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:26,419
- ... out, turn.
- Around.

829
01:02:26,444 --> 01:02:31,591
No, just pick her up and hold her.
She'll be okay.

830
01:02:31,616 --> 01:02:38,641
You're getting your kick good. Here.

831
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:45,938
Kick, out...

832
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:49,308
This is where it gets stuck.

833
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,677
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

834
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:52,911
Here.

835
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:57,214
- Miriam's making a fool of herself.
- Out.

836
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:00,685
- Anybody got a cigarette?
- Yeah, I do.

837
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:04,488
Sylvia, you don't smoke.

838
01:03:04,513 --> 01:03:07,225
You don't smoke?

839
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,894
No.

840
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,096
Why-? Why do you wanna start now?

841
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:16,066
I'm scared to death, that's why.
What, you don't smoke?

842
01:03:16,091 --> 01:03:23,116
- No.
- How come?

843
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:25,642
- I don't want the cancer.
- Oh, my God.

844
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:30,713
- Give me the cigarette.
- Go ahead, do what you want.

845
01:03:30,738 --> 01:03:33,315
I just think you ought to
take care of your body.

846
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:38,220
My body? What for?

847
01:03:38,245 --> 01:03:43,592
The body is the temple of the Lord.

848
01:03:43,617 --> 01:03:47,762
You're serious.

849
01:03:47,787 --> 01:03:49,864
So you rob a bank...

850
01:03:49,889 --> 01:03:56,914
...but you keep your body pure.
Is that it?

851
01:03:58,261 --> 01:04:02,940
You gonna smoke or what?

852
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,110
Yes.

853
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:11,160
If I die of cancer,
it'll be half your fault.

854
01:04:12,443 --> 01:04:17,356
- No, it's because you're weak.
- Right, I'm weak.

855
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:20,291
- One, two, three-
- Where's your bullets?

856
01:04:20,316 --> 01:04:24,696
Mulvaney speaking.

857
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:27,699
It's Moretti.

858
01:04:27,724 --> 01:04:31,069
Wants to talk to you.

859
01:04:31,094 --> 01:04:33,705
- Yeah.
- Will you guys hold it down back there?

860
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:40,754
Sonny, they're bringing in your wife.

861
01:04:50,212 --> 01:04:53,055
Step back. Stay back.

862
01:04:53,080 --> 01:05:00,105
- Where's Moretti?
- Probably in the bar.

863
01:05:03,324 --> 01:05:08,303
In the barbershop.

864
01:05:08,328 --> 01:05:10,772
What's that?

865
01:05:10,797 --> 01:05:13,074
We went to Bellevue
where you told us...

866
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:14,743
...said he was his wife.

867
01:05:14,768 --> 01:05:16,778
They were married in a church.

868
01:05:16,803 --> 01:05:18,847
Jesus Christ!

869
01:05:18,872 --> 01:05:23,752
Leon.

870
01:05:23,777 --> 01:05:25,786
Leon!

871
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:27,955
Hey, Leon, over here!

872
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,424
Leon! Hey, Leon!

873
01:05:30,449 --> 01:05:33,327
- Now move it back.
- Leon, over here!

874
01:05:33,352 --> 01:05:40,377
Leon! Happy birthday!

875
01:05:46,064 --> 01:05:52,979
- Hey, give us some room, huh?
- Watch his head.

876
01:05:53,004 --> 01:05:54,848
He's a queer?

877
01:05:54,873 --> 01:05:59,184
Sarge. Sarge, he wants you!

878
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:02,621
Come on, get the shield out of here.
I don't need it now.

879
01:06:02,646 --> 01:06:05,157
Where were you four hours ago,
when I needed it?

880
01:06:05,182 --> 01:06:07,860
He's not gonna shoot.
Yeah, Sonny, what?

881
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:10,295
What happened? Is he all right?

882
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,798
- He's a little groggy right now, okay?
- No, let me talk to him.

883
01:06:13,823 --> 01:06:20,071
Let me get him on his feet and
call you back. Shut the fucking door.

884
01:06:20,096 --> 01:06:23,274
Stop the noise in here.
I don't wanna hear a fucking sound!

885
01:06:23,299 --> 01:06:25,142
Typewriter!

886
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:27,678
- Get off the fucking phone!
- Sarge.

887
01:06:27,703 --> 01:06:29,814
Now!

888
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:34,217
Give me some water, all right?

889
01:06:34,242 --> 01:06:37,587
Leon? Leon.

890
01:06:37,612 --> 01:06:42,526
You all right, Leon? They give you a shot
down at the hospital or something?

891
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:45,862
Oh, God.
They shot me with, like, unreal!

892
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,097
You gotta get ahold of yourself...

893
01:06:48,122 --> 01:06:51,400
...so you can talk to him,
see if he'll come out of the bank.

894
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:53,002
Oh, no.

895
01:06:53,027 --> 01:06:56,005
He's got eight people, and a kid
named Sal. You know him?

896
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:59,542
- No, not really.
- Says he's gonna shoot these eight people.

897
01:06:59,567 --> 01:07:03,378
I can't help it.
I can't stop him from anything.

898
01:07:03,403 --> 01:07:05,313
Who will he listen to, then?

899
01:07:05,338 --> 01:07:08,383
I can't- I can't talk to him.
He won't listen to anybody.

900
01:07:08,408 --> 01:07:12,453
He's been-
He's been crazy all summer.

901
01:07:12,478 --> 01:07:15,690
He's tried to kill me since June.

902
01:07:15,715 --> 01:07:19,226
Yeah. Put a gun to my head.
And he cut me with a knife.

903
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:23,397
- He beat up my friends.
- Did you contact the police?

904
01:07:23,422 --> 01:07:25,399
What good would that do?

905
01:07:25,424 --> 01:07:29,469
It'd just make him mad. They don't
know him. And it wouldn't stop him.

906
01:07:29,494 --> 01:07:36,518
- Somebody's gotta stop him.
- You don't understand. He's crazy.

907
01:07:37,935 --> 01:07:40,780
He's got a wife, children.

908
01:07:40,805 --> 01:07:43,649
He's a wonderful father.

909
01:07:43,674 --> 01:07:44,917
His mother...

910
01:07:44,942 --> 01:07:50,156
...you should see her. Together with
his father, they're like a car wreck.

911
01:07:50,181 --> 01:07:52,857
It just- It just rolls off his back.

912
01:07:52,882 --> 01:07:57,762
He sees them.
He pays the rent. Unbelievable.

913
01:07:57,787 --> 01:08:02,667
I was the one who wanted to get
married. He didn't really want it...

914
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:05,737
...but he did it.
I don't know why.

915
01:08:05,762 --> 01:08:11,375
Why did you wanna get married?

916
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,646
I thought it would help me.

917
01:08:15,671 --> 01:08:17,748
But it didn't.

918
01:08:17,773 --> 01:08:21,185
I- I was so confused.
I was doing...

919
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:23,921
...insane things.

920
01:08:23,946 --> 01:08:30,259
What sort of things, Leon?

921
01:08:30,284 --> 01:08:32,595
After the wedding...

922
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:36,532
...I ran off for 10 days
to Atlantic City.

923
01:08:36,557 --> 01:08:38,901
Sonny was frantic.

924
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:44,206
He knew I'd been drinking. He didn't
know where I was, who I was with.

925
01:08:44,231 --> 01:08:47,609
I couldn't explain the things I did.

926
01:08:47,634 --> 01:08:50,212
So I went to a psychiatrist...

927
01:08:50,237 --> 01:08:52,414
...who told me...

928
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:59,463
...that I was a woman
trapped in a man's body.

929
01:09:03,883 --> 01:09:08,129
So right away Sonny wanted to give me
money for the sex-change operation.

930
01:09:08,154 --> 01:09:10,331
But where was he gonna get it?

931
01:09:10,356 --> 01:09:13,000
$2500?

932
01:09:13,025 --> 01:09:16,002
My God, he was in hock
up to his ears already.

933
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:18,071
He needed the money
for your operation?

934
01:09:18,096 --> 01:09:21,307
It drove him crazy. He-

935
01:09:21,332 --> 01:09:24,644
He would fly into these rages.

936
01:09:24,669 --> 01:09:27,147
And I got more depressed than ever.

937
01:09:27,172 --> 01:09:32,484
I knew I'd never get my operation.

938
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:36,522
So I tried to kill myself.
I took about a half a pound of pills.

939
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:41,593
Blues, reds, yellows, screamers,
uppers, downers, you name it.

940
01:09:41,618 --> 01:09:45,664
And I wound up in a hospital.

941
01:09:45,689 --> 01:09:48,032
And Sonny comes there...

942
01:09:48,057 --> 01:09:51,402
...and he just looks at me.

943
01:09:51,427 --> 01:09:53,337
And he says:

944
01:09:53,362 --> 01:09:55,606
"Why, Leon?

945
01:09:55,631 --> 01:10:02,656
When things were going so good?"

946
01:10:02,905 --> 01:10:05,348
Don't you think-?

947
01:10:05,373 --> 01:10:12,222
Leon, don't you think
he sort of did it for you?

948
01:10:12,247 --> 01:10:15,892
Yeah, I guess so.

949
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:20,296
Don't you think you owe it to him
to try to get him out?

950
01:10:20,321 --> 01:10:24,500
I can't talk to him.

951
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:28,137
You're up to your neck in it, Leon.
You're an accessory.

952
01:10:28,162 --> 01:10:33,409
- No, no. They can't hold me responsible.
- Wait, you could help us a little.

953
01:10:33,434 --> 01:10:34,610
I'm afraid.

954
01:10:34,635 --> 01:10:39,247
Just talk to him for a minute.
How can he hurt you on the phone?

955
01:10:39,272 --> 01:10:43,885
- All you're gonna be is on the phone.
- I can't. I don't know what to...

956
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:50,935
- Just talk with him on the phone.
- I can't. No.

957
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:56,230
You think about it, Leon.

958
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:02,269
Yeah.

959
01:11:02,294 --> 01:11:06,773
- He doesn't wanna talk to you.
- What do you mean, won't talk to me?

960
01:11:06,798 --> 01:11:13,822
- Let me work on it.
- I thought you were doing that.

961
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:25,466
He don't wanna talk to me.

962
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:39,104
Police are questioning Leon Shermer,
a 26-year-old admitted homosexual...

963
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:44,008
...who claims to have married
one of the bank robbers last November.

964
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:47,678
According to sources in the barbershop
where Leon is being held...

965
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:49,480
...Leon has reportedly said...

966
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:54,285
...they were married in an
official ceremony by a Father Burke.

967
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,655
Leon's story has been confirmed.

968
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:02,025
Seven bridesmaids, all male,
Sonny's mother and 70 other guests...

969
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:05,995
...all members of the gay community,
were present.

970
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:12,202
We've been able to obtain
a still photograph of Leon in his gown.

971
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:13,903
Leon has confirmed...

972
01:12:13,928 --> 01:12:20,309
...that the gowns for himself
and his bridesmaids cost $700.

973
01:12:20,334 --> 01:12:22,611
We have not confirmed the story...

974
01:12:22,636 --> 01:12:27,249
...with the priest. But we are told
that he was subsequently defrocked.

975
01:12:27,274 --> 01:12:32,687
Phone calls have arrived from
various factions of the gay community.

976
01:12:32,712 --> 01:12:36,858
Some in support of Sonny and his
actions, others totally condemning...

977
01:12:36,883 --> 01:12:39,760
...the present events
and calling the marriage a farce...

978
01:12:39,785 --> 01:12:46,067
...and, quote, "A case
of sheer exhibitionism. " End quote.

979
01:12:46,092 --> 01:12:49,836
Our coverage of the Brooklyn robbery
where two homosexuals hold hostages...

980
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:52,339
...for their demands of
a helicopter, a jet...

981
01:12:52,364 --> 01:12:55,942
Sonny. Sonny, they said,
"Two homosexuals in the bank. "

982
01:12:55,967 --> 01:12:58,845
- Right on TV. You hear?
- What difference does it make?

983
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:05,894
They're gonna say anything they want.
Let them say it.

984
01:13:07,478 --> 01:13:11,523
Well, I'm not a homosexual.

985
01:13:11,548 --> 01:13:18,573
Tell them to get that right.
That's going out on the TV.

986
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:26,204
Sal, what am I supposed to do? I can't
control what they say on television.

987
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:30,375
What should I do? I'm doing
everything I can. I can't do that.

988
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:34,212
I mean, they're-

989
01:13:34,237 --> 01:13:36,281
Look, Sal.

990
01:13:36,306 --> 01:13:40,550
Forget about it. It's just a freak show
to them, anyway. It don't matter.

991
01:13:40,575 --> 01:13:47,600
Whatever they say, it don't matter.

992
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:55,607
It'll be all right.

993
01:13:59,293 --> 01:14:02,638
What's the matter with you?

994
01:14:02,663 --> 01:14:05,808
You shouldn't let something like that
spoil your fun, you know?

995
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:12,857
You gotta get fun out of life.

996
01:14:13,473 --> 01:14:14,816
Shit.

997
01:14:14,841 --> 01:14:17,919
Where's the goddamn jet?

998
01:14:17,944 --> 01:14:20,922
They're always screaming overhead,
going somewhere...

999
01:14:20,947 --> 01:14:27,971
...when you don't need them,
you know?

1000
01:14:46,804 --> 01:14:52,318
What are you gonna tell the pilot
when you get on the plane?

1001
01:14:52,343 --> 01:14:54,287
You have to know, right?

1002
01:14:54,312 --> 01:14:56,756
- Did you know Holland's pretty good?
- Use this.

1003
01:14:56,781 --> 01:15:00,892
- Holland?
- They sheltered people during the war.

1004
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:02,861
They're good people.

1005
01:15:02,886 --> 01:15:04,563
Where's Holland?

1006
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:10,535
- It's right up...
- It's over there.

1007
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,037
She doesn't have a map.

1008
01:15:12,062 --> 01:15:16,674
It's got good chocolate.

1009
01:15:16,699 --> 01:15:19,343
Come on, get in the vault.
Get in the vault. Come on.

1010
01:15:19,368 --> 01:15:26,393
Quickly!

1011
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:38,995
They're waiting for us
to do something, I think.

1012
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:41,865
Sonny.

1013
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:45,034
- Come on out for a second, please.
- It's him, Sonny.

1014
01:15:45,059 --> 01:15:50,239
Come on out here.
I wanna talk to you a second.

1015
01:15:50,264 --> 01:15:57,289
- Come on, Sonny.
- Sonny.

1016
01:16:00,274 --> 01:16:02,418
Sonny.

1017
01:16:02,443 --> 01:16:05,119
Come on out, Sonny.

1018
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:11,259
Sonny?

1019
01:16:11,284 --> 01:16:14,328
Come on out a minute.

1020
01:16:14,353 --> 01:16:21,377
That's it, Sonny.

1021
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:28,408
Hey, Sonny!

1022
01:16:28,433 --> 01:16:32,112
Moretti!

1023
01:16:32,137 --> 01:16:36,650
What the fuck is going on?
Get the lights back on.

1024
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:39,952
Moretti!

1025
01:16:39,977 --> 01:16:42,488
Who are you?

1026
01:16:42,513 --> 01:16:46,926
FBl, Sheldon.

1027
01:16:46,951 --> 01:16:48,861
Oh, good.

1028
01:16:48,886 --> 01:16:51,997
About time. Maybe we can
get this thing started, huh?

1029
01:16:52,022 --> 01:16:53,965
Look, get the lights back on...

1030
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:57,469
...and the air conditioner.
We got no air conditioning.

1031
01:16:57,494 --> 01:17:01,406
- No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.
- Favors?

1032
01:17:01,431 --> 01:17:04,409
You been doing me favors all night?

1033
01:17:04,434 --> 01:17:10,113
I have a jet, limo will be here
in a half hour.

1034
01:17:10,138 --> 01:17:13,083
I want the hostages.

1035
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:15,519
No, no, no. Bullshit.

1036
01:17:15,544 --> 01:17:18,288
I'd like to work with you on this,
not against you.

1037
01:17:18,313 --> 01:17:22,659
The hostages are
what's keeping me alive.

1038
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:25,696
When do I get them?

1039
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:29,198
Didn't they tell you anything?

1040
01:17:29,223 --> 01:17:33,035
I'd like to hear it from you.

1041
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:38,007
You get one hostage for the
limousine that you bring me in.

1042
01:17:38,032 --> 01:17:41,477
One hos- One hostage for the jet.

1043
01:17:41,502 --> 01:17:45,147
Then I get to the airport.
I go into the plane, check it all out.

1044
01:17:45,172 --> 01:17:49,818
And if it's okay,
then they all come out.

1045
01:17:49,843 --> 01:17:52,420
- I wanna go inside.
- Why?

1046
01:17:52,445 --> 01:17:56,057
- To see if everybody's all right.
- They're all right.

1047
01:17:56,082 --> 01:18:03,106
No, I have to see.

1048
01:18:06,759 --> 01:18:08,469
You got guts.

1049
01:18:08,494 --> 01:18:12,039
Think if we slit their throats,
we're gonna let you out?

1050
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:19,088
I have to see.

1051
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:32,234
I gotta check with my partner.

1052
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:41,776
The FBl, Sal. They're coming in.

1053
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:50,618
Hey, pussycat. There you go.

1054
01:18:52,034 --> 01:18:55,513
You'd like to kill me?
Bet you would.

1055
01:18:55,538 --> 01:18:58,983
I wouldn't like to kill you.
I will if I have to.

1056
01:18:59,008 --> 01:19:02,119
It's your job, right?

1057
01:19:02,144 --> 01:19:03,921
The guy who kills me...

1058
01:19:03,946 --> 01:19:10,970
...I hope he does it because he hates
my guts, not because it's his job.

1059
01:19:14,756 --> 01:19:21,780
Nobody give your right name.
It's the FBl.

1060
01:19:29,470 --> 01:19:33,148
Just wanna make sure all you
young ladies are all right in here.

1061
01:19:33,173 --> 01:19:34,617
- Look...
- We're all right.

1062
01:19:34,642 --> 01:19:37,919
...they asked for the jet hours ago.
Now, what are you doing?

1063
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:41,422
That's being set up.
We'll have you out in a couple of hours.

1064
01:19:41,447 --> 01:19:44,759
- A couple of hours?
- Why not give them what they want?

1065
01:19:44,784 --> 01:19:47,895
They'll get what they want. We
wanna be sure we get what we want.

1066
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,533
That's to get you all out of here safe.

1067
01:19:52,558 --> 01:19:54,135
You two boys too.

1068
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:59,239
That's close enough.

1069
01:19:59,264 --> 01:20:03,677
Tell the TV to stop saying
there's two homosexuals in here.

1070
01:20:03,702 --> 01:20:07,581
I will, Sal.

1071
01:20:07,606 --> 01:20:14,630
Outside for a minute, Sonny?

1072
01:20:34,798 --> 01:20:36,808
You handle yourself well, Sonny.

1073
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:41,112
A lot of men would have choked. We
might have had a death on our hands.

1074
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:44,315
But you handled it. I respect that.

1075
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:48,319
Now, don't you try to take Sal.
We'll handle him.

1076
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:53,991
- Just sit tight and you won't get hurt.
- Wait. What are you talking about?

1077
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:57,361
You just sit quiet.

1078
01:20:57,386 --> 01:21:02,331
We'll handle Sal.

1079
01:21:02,356 --> 01:21:09,381
You think I'd sell him out, you fuck?

1080
01:21:22,075 --> 01:21:25,854
What'd he say?

1081
01:21:25,879 --> 01:21:28,056
He was just talking
about arrangements.

1082
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:31,927
I talked to him about the TV, Sal.
It's gonna be all right.

1083
01:21:31,952 --> 01:21:33,894
That's all?

1084
01:21:33,919 --> 01:21:36,697
Yeah.

1085
01:21:36,722 --> 01:21:39,934
Why couldn't he say that in here?

1086
01:21:39,959 --> 01:21:46,984
I don't know. He wanted to show me
how the bus is coming in.

1087
01:21:55,573 --> 01:21:57,784
What's the matter?

1088
01:21:57,809 --> 01:22:02,188
Somebody get a glass of water.

1089
01:22:02,213 --> 01:22:05,158
Got a hankie?

1090
01:22:05,183 --> 01:22:06,525
They poisoned the pizza.

1091
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:11,096
It's not the pizza.
He's got diabetes.

1092
01:22:11,121 --> 01:22:15,534
He had some Coke before.
Don't give him anything. I'll hold it.

1093
01:22:15,559 --> 01:22:22,583
What can we do for you,
Mr. Mulvaney? Tell us.

1094
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:28,679
Is there a doctor out here?

1095
01:22:28,704 --> 01:22:33,584
We need a doctor in here.

1096
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:37,455
We need a doctor.

1097
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,689
- What's wrong?
- The manager, he's diabetic.

1098
01:22:39,714 --> 01:22:46,739
He don't look good.

1099
01:22:54,962 --> 01:23:00,075
I gotta search you.

1100
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,579
Watch out he don't kiss you, doc.

1101
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:07,750
Looking for an antonym.

1102
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:14,799
Okay.

1103
01:23:15,114 --> 01:23:17,826
Just him.

1104
01:23:17,851 --> 01:23:20,495
Sonny.

1105
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:27,545
I've convinced Leon to talk to you.
He's on the phone now.

1106
01:23:38,036 --> 01:23:45,060
He's coming on.

1107
01:23:48,312 --> 01:23:50,456
Hello.

1108
01:23:50,481 --> 01:23:52,158
Hello?

1109
01:23:52,183 --> 01:23:53,993
Hello, Leon?

1110
01:23:54,018 --> 01:23:57,129
Hello. Hello, Sonny.

1111
01:23:57,154 --> 01:23:58,664
What happened?

1112
01:23:58,689 --> 01:24:01,299
How you-? How you doing?

1113
01:24:01,324 --> 01:24:04,369
Well, I'm out of the hospital.

1114
01:24:04,394 --> 01:24:09,007
Yeah, I know. You know,
I thought you'd never get out.

1115
01:24:09,032 --> 01:24:12,377
Hot. I never thought
I'd get out this way, I'll tell you.

1116
01:24:12,402 --> 01:24:14,312
Yeah.

1117
01:24:14,337 --> 01:24:17,882
So how you doing?

1118
01:24:17,907 --> 01:24:20,384
- I'm a little shaky.
- Oh, yeah?

1119
01:24:20,409 --> 01:24:24,788
Moretti told me that you were
all drugged up...

1120
01:24:24,813 --> 01:24:29,593
...so I figured that's why you didn't
talk to me. I was wondering why.

1121
01:24:29,618 --> 01:24:31,595
It was really terrible, you know?

1122
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:35,031
I mean, you walk in, and right away
they say you're crazy.

1123
01:24:35,056 --> 01:24:38,368
And then they start sticking
things in your arm.

1124
01:24:38,393 --> 01:24:44,107
I mean, how do they expect you to get
uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?

1125
01:24:44,132 --> 01:24:48,111
I'm- I'm just starting
to come out of it now.

1126
01:24:48,136 --> 01:24:52,047
- So...
- So how are you?

1127
01:24:52,072 --> 01:24:55,551
I'm fine.

1128
01:24:55,576 --> 01:25:02,124
This is something, huh?

1129
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:03,959
Yeah, yeah.

1130
01:25:03,984 --> 01:25:07,762
I don't know, Leon, you know?
I'm dying here.

1131
01:25:07,787 --> 01:25:11,098
I'm dying.

1132
01:25:11,123 --> 01:25:14,569
Don't you ever listen to yourself
when you say you're dying?

1133
01:25:14,594 --> 01:25:17,939
- Did you ever listen to yourself?
- What are you talking-?

1134
01:25:17,964 --> 01:25:21,642
What do you mean, what am I
talking about? You're dying.

1135
01:25:21,667 --> 01:25:25,745
Do you know that you say that
to me every day? "I'm dying. "

1136
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:28,949
You're not dying.
You're killing the people around you.

1137
01:25:28,974 --> 01:25:32,652
Leon, don't give me that shit.
I don't need the deep shit now!

1138
01:25:32,677 --> 01:25:35,388
You don't realize what
the things you do mean.

1139
01:25:35,413 --> 01:25:38,358
Yeah? I know what I do.

1140
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:40,292
You stick a gun
to somebody's head.

1141
01:25:40,317 --> 01:25:44,263
- I don't know what I'm doing sometimes.
- Obviously, you don't.

1142
01:25:44,288 --> 01:25:47,466
"Go to sleep
so it won't hurt when I shoot. "

1143
01:25:47,491 --> 01:25:50,302
What do you think
I've been doing in the hospital?

1144
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:53,138
I take a handful of pills
to get away from you.

1145
01:25:53,163 --> 01:25:54,940
- Right?
- Yeah.

1146
01:25:54,965 --> 01:25:57,742
So now I'm talking to you
on the phone again, right?

1147
01:25:57,767 --> 01:26:00,678
I- I- I got no job.
I don't have friends.

1148
01:26:00,703 --> 01:26:05,249
I can't live.
I have to live with people.

1149
01:26:05,274 --> 01:26:07,385
This death business, I'm sorry.

1150
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:10,655
I don't know what I'm getting here
with that shit.

1151
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:15,092
You know, what am I supposed
to say to that shit? This is going on.

1152
01:26:15,117 --> 01:26:17,761
- And you're giving me that shit.
- I'm sorry.

1153
01:26:17,786 --> 01:26:19,696
You know what's happening with me.

1154
01:26:19,721 --> 01:26:22,599
You know the pressures
I've been having, right?

1155
01:26:22,624 --> 01:26:26,136
I got all these pressures. You know it.
You're in that hospital...

1156
01:26:26,161 --> 01:26:29,505
...with them tubes coming out
and want that operation, right?

1157
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:32,308
You're giving me that shit.
Everybody's giving me shit.

1158
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:37,313
Everybody needs money.
So you needed money? I got you money.

1159
01:26:37,338 --> 01:26:41,217
- I didn't ask you to rob a bank!
- I know you didn't ask me.

1160
01:26:41,242 --> 01:26:45,654
Look, I'm not putting this
on anybody, you know?

1161
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:48,857
Nothing on nobody.
I did this on my own. You see?

1162
01:26:48,882 --> 01:26:52,227
All on my own, I did it.
But I just want you to know something.

1163
01:26:52,252 --> 01:26:55,663
I want you to know
that I'm getting out of here.

1164
01:26:55,688 --> 01:26:57,966
I'm getting a plane out of here...

1165
01:26:57,991 --> 01:27:02,136
...and I just wanted you to know it.
And I wanted you to come down...

1166
01:27:02,161 --> 01:27:05,339
...and I wanted to just say
goodbye to you.

1167
01:27:05,364 --> 01:27:08,876
Or, if you wanted to,
you can come with me.

1168
01:27:08,901 --> 01:27:11,812
You're free to do what you want.
That's just what...

1169
01:27:11,837 --> 01:27:15,883
...I wanted to say to you, that's all.

1170
01:27:15,908 --> 01:27:18,484
- I'm- I'm free to do what I want, huh?
- Right.

1171
01:27:18,509 --> 01:27:23,523
I been trying to get away from you for
months and I'm going with you on a trip?

1172
01:27:23,548 --> 01:27:25,958
Where? Where are you going?

1173
01:27:25,983 --> 01:27:30,096
I don't know where yet.
We said Algeria. I don't know.

1174
01:27:30,121 --> 01:27:32,398
So I'll go to Algeria.
I don't know yet.

1175
01:27:32,423 --> 01:27:36,568
Why are you going to Algeria?

1176
01:27:36,593 --> 01:27:39,738
I don't know why. They got
a Howard Johnson's there.

1177
01:27:39,763 --> 01:27:42,874
Howard Johnson's. You're warped, you
know? You're really warped.

1178
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:45,577
I'm warped. I know I'm warped.

1179
01:27:45,602 --> 01:27:50,715
God, Algeria. It's-

1180
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:54,285
You know, they walk around
with masks on, things on their heads.

1181
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:57,722
- They're a bunch of crazy people.
- What am I supposed to do?

1182
01:27:57,747 --> 01:28:01,092
- You could have picked a better place.
- Like where?

1183
01:28:01,117 --> 01:28:05,362
Sweden? Denmark?

1184
01:28:05,387 --> 01:28:09,432
Yeah, I like that. Yeah.

1185
01:28:09,457 --> 01:28:12,802
You know what?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.

1186
01:28:12,827 --> 01:28:17,207
I had to tell him it's not a country.
He don't know where Wyoming is.

1187
01:28:17,232 --> 01:28:24,256
I'm with a guy who don't know where
Wyoming is. Think you got problems?

1188
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:26,281
So, Sal is with you?

1189
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:30,786
Oh, boy.
You'd be better off giving up.

1190
01:28:30,811 --> 01:28:34,389
I'm not giving up, because
why have I done this so far?

1191
01:28:34,414 --> 01:28:38,660
I've gone so far with this,
and why should I give up now?

1192
01:28:38,685 --> 01:28:43,097
I can't give up.

1193
01:28:43,122 --> 01:28:49,170
- Would you do me a favor then?
- Yeah, what?

1194
01:28:49,195 --> 01:28:54,142
These guys that have me
down here, you know...

1195
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:57,644
...they think I'm part of the plot
to rob the bank.

1196
01:28:57,669 --> 01:29:00,847
That's crazy, Leon. That's crazy.

1197
01:29:00,872 --> 01:29:03,583
They're bullshitting you,
giving you a snow job.

1198
01:29:03,608 --> 01:29:06,453
- They told me I was an accessory.
- No.

1199
01:29:06,478 --> 01:29:09,456
That's just a con job on you.
Don't listen to that.

1200
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:13,659
I have to listen to it.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny.

1201
01:29:13,684 --> 01:29:16,629
- Leon, you're not going to prison.
- How do you know?

1202
01:29:16,654 --> 01:29:18,631
Because I know. Believe me.

1203
01:29:18,656 --> 01:29:21,300
- Look, please, just tell them.
- Please what?

1204
01:29:21,325 --> 01:29:22,968
Tell them what?

1205
01:29:22,993 --> 01:29:27,106
That you didn't do it?
Are they on the phone now?

1206
01:29:27,131 --> 01:29:29,674
- Are they on the phone now?
- Yeah.

1207
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:32,610
That's great, Leon.
That's really terrific.

1208
01:29:32,635 --> 01:29:35,380
You talk to me with them on the phone.
Really smart.

1209
01:29:35,405 --> 01:29:37,515
- I have no choice!
- What do you mean?

1210
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:41,686
What am I supposed to do? There's
7000 fucking cops all around me.

1211
01:29:41,711 --> 01:29:43,888
- Who's on now?
- Look, don't lay it on me!

1212
01:29:43,913 --> 01:29:47,191
I'm not, but you knew
that was going on, right?

1213
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:49,393
You knew what was happening, right?

1214
01:29:49,418 --> 01:29:50,894
Yeah!

1215
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:55,399
I wanna know
who's on the phone now.

1216
01:29:55,424 --> 01:29:59,102
Moretti. Moretti, is that you?

1217
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:02,538
Hello.

1218
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:05,975
Will somebody talk to me?
Somebody gonna talk to me or what?

1219
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,879
- They on the phone now?
- They won't talk to you.

1220
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:15,117
All right. He didn't do it, okay?
He had nothing to do with it.

1221
01:30:15,142 --> 01:30:18,019
All right. Now, will you get
the fuck off the phone?

1222
01:30:18,044 --> 01:30:23,158
Are they off the phone?

1223
01:30:23,183 --> 01:30:24,359
Yeah.

1224
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:27,996
Terrific. That really convinced them.
That's what they wanted to know.

1225
01:30:28,021 --> 01:30:30,131
- Did I do it for you?
- Yeah, thank-

1226
01:30:30,156 --> 01:30:33,401
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

1227
01:30:33,426 --> 01:30:36,170
So now what?
What are you gonna do?

1228
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:39,340
Well, I thought...

1229
01:30:39,365 --> 01:30:41,709
...that I would
go back to the hospital.

1230
01:30:41,734 --> 01:30:46,280
They're really nice there. They
seem like they're trying to help me.

1231
01:30:46,305 --> 01:30:49,183
That's good, then.
You found something.

1232
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:53,019
Yeah, I don't know if I have or not.

1233
01:30:53,044 --> 01:30:55,521
So are you gonna still
have the operation?

1234
01:30:55,546 --> 01:30:58,725
Yeah. Yeah.

1235
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:05,775
So then, what am I
supposed to say to you?

1236
01:31:08,392 --> 01:31:11,403
Thanks a lot...

1237
01:31:11,428 --> 01:31:14,239
...and bon voyage.

1238
01:31:14,264 --> 01:31:16,541
Yeah, right.
See you sometime.

1239
01:31:16,566 --> 01:31:19,544
Yeah. I'll see you in my dreams, huh?

1240
01:31:19,569 --> 01:31:25,082
Right, I'll write a song.

1241
01:31:25,107 --> 01:31:32,132
- I don't know. Life's so funny.
- You said a mouthful, sweetheart.

1242
01:31:34,483 --> 01:31:40,096
Well- Goodbye, huh?

1243
01:31:40,121 --> 01:31:47,146
Bye.

1244
01:32:07,815 --> 01:32:09,425
- Yeah.
- Give me- Can I have-?

1245
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:11,927
- Moretti. Moretti.
- Hey. Hey.

1246
01:32:11,952 --> 01:32:15,129
You cut off the incoming calls.
Can I have a line?

1247
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:17,832
I wanna talk to my wife
and to my kids.

1248
01:32:17,857 --> 01:32:21,769
He wants an outside line,
is it all right?

1249
01:32:21,794 --> 01:32:26,040
- I want a line.
- Yeah, Sonny, I'm getting it.

1250
01:32:26,065 --> 01:32:30,243
I could call anybody,
they'd put them on the phone.

1251
01:32:30,268 --> 01:32:33,113
The Pope, an astronaut...

1252
01:32:33,138 --> 01:32:36,049
...the wisest of the wise.

1253
01:32:36,074 --> 01:32:40,253
Who do I have to call?

1254
01:32:40,278 --> 01:32:47,302
I just don't know what to do.

1255
01:32:49,587 --> 01:32:51,530
- Hello.
- Angie.

1256
01:32:51,555 --> 01:32:54,266
Sonny, Jesus!
I was watching it on TV.

1257
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:58,904
- Yeah. So where are the kids?
- I sent them to the neighbors.

1258
01:32:58,929 --> 01:33:02,907
I can't believe. I can't believe.
I mean, it ain't like you.

1259
01:33:02,932 --> 01:33:04,142
I know.

1260
01:33:04,167 --> 01:33:07,178
You've never done anything
like it before in your life.

1261
01:33:07,203 --> 01:33:10,048
I'm dying, you know that?
I'm dying here.

1262
01:33:10,073 --> 01:33:14,986
I blame myself. I notice you been
tense, like something is happening.

1263
01:33:15,011 --> 01:33:18,323
Like that night you're yelling
at the kids like a madman.

1264
01:33:18,348 --> 01:33:20,057
Then you want me to go...

1265
01:33:20,082 --> 01:33:23,027
...on that ride, here
to there, full of those kids.

1266
01:33:23,052 --> 01:33:26,663
It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go,
so you yell at me:

1267
01:33:26,688 --> 01:33:31,201
"You pig, get on the fucking ride!"
Everything fell out of me.

1268
01:33:31,226 --> 01:33:34,838
My heart, my liver just fell to the floor.
I mean, everything.

1269
01:33:34,863 --> 01:33:39,709
You know what it felt like? You yelling
at me in front of all those people?

1270
01:33:39,734 --> 01:33:42,245
You never talked to me
like that before, Sonny.

1271
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:45,181
I think, "He's gonna shoot me,
dump my body in the river. "

1272
01:33:45,206 --> 01:33:48,117
- Will you just shut up?
- I was scared of you!

1273
01:33:48,142 --> 01:33:52,854
Will you shut the fuck up and
listen to me?! Just listen to me!

1274
01:33:52,879 --> 01:33:55,390
You see that?
With the language and everything.

1275
01:33:55,415 --> 01:33:58,026
I'm trying to talk to you, and you-

1276
01:33:58,051 --> 01:34:00,028
A person can't communicate with you!

1277
01:34:00,053 --> 01:34:04,699
I mean, what am I here?
I'm your wife. I'm your wife!

1278
01:34:04,724 --> 01:34:07,335
You know something?
You hurt me.

1279
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:12,039
You hurt me, you know that?
Can you imagine, marrying another man?

1280
01:34:12,064 --> 01:34:14,375
Did I ever do anything
to make you do that?

1281
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,445
Did I ever turn you down or anything?

1282
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:19,480
I know I let myself get fat.

1283
01:34:19,505 --> 01:34:22,950
- Don't call yourself fat.
- You can't stand me to say it.

1284
01:34:22,975 --> 01:34:27,153
Like I can't stand you being
a bank robber. That's what love is.

1285
01:34:27,178 --> 01:34:29,789
Yeah? You know what love is, right?

1286
01:34:29,814 --> 01:34:33,460
If you know what love is so much,
why didn't you come down here?

1287
01:34:33,485 --> 01:34:38,465
- Well...
- Talk to me about love, go ahead.

1288
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:40,166
Sonny, I'm scared.

1289
01:34:40,191 --> 01:34:43,268
I'm scared. Are they
gonna shoot me or something?

1290
01:34:43,293 --> 01:34:44,937
They're not gonna shoot you!

1291
01:34:44,962 --> 01:34:49,108
You should see it on the TV.
They got cannons, machine guns.

1292
01:34:49,133 --> 01:34:51,376
They're after me, Angie, not you.

1293
01:34:51,401 --> 01:34:53,612
It's late already
by the time I find out...

1294
01:34:53,637 --> 01:35:00,661
...it's just you and Sal. I can't
get a babysitter! What'll I do?

1295
01:35:28,637 --> 01:35:35,661
Listen, I think I better take him back
for a cardiac check.

1296
01:35:43,884 --> 01:35:46,694
So, what's the matter?
What, he gonna die or what?

1297
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:53,744
No, no. It's just a precautionary
measure. It's awfully warm in here.

1298
01:36:04,736 --> 01:36:07,881
All right, then. Let's go,
let him out.

1299
01:36:07,906 --> 01:36:10,817
I'm not going. I'm okay.

1300
01:36:10,842 --> 01:36:12,853
I just needed the injection.

1301
01:36:12,878 --> 01:36:17,357
What, you trying to be a hero?
You don't look good. We'll let you out.

1302
01:36:17,382 --> 01:36:20,026
I'm not trying to be anything.

1303
01:36:20,051 --> 01:36:22,161
I just wanna be left alone.

1304
01:36:22,186 --> 01:36:24,263
Okay?

1305
01:36:24,288 --> 01:36:28,768
- No one's bothering you.
- I wish to fuck you never came.

1306
01:36:28,793 --> 01:36:30,269
That's all.

1307
01:36:30,294 --> 01:36:37,318
Don't try to act like
you're some angel of human kindness.

1308
01:36:39,135 --> 01:36:46,160
Out of the closets and into the streets!
Out of the closets and into the streets!

1309
01:36:47,377 --> 01:36:54,401
Out of the closets and into the streets!
Out of the closets and into the streets!

1310
01:37:01,557 --> 01:37:05,202
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1311
01:37:05,227 --> 01:37:08,571
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1312
01:37:08,596 --> 01:37:15,621
Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!

1313
01:37:41,861 --> 01:37:44,772
Ladies.

1314
01:37:44,797 --> 01:37:47,675
Ladies.

1315
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:51,545
I wanna apologize
for my use of language back there.

1316
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:58,594
Why? What did you say,
Mr. Mulvaney?

1317
01:38:00,679 --> 01:38:03,423
- What did he say?
- He said the F-word.

1318
01:38:03,448 --> 01:38:05,258
- What?
- What did he say?

1319
01:38:05,283 --> 01:38:12,308
He said the F-word.

1320
01:38:13,892 --> 01:38:15,601
- Fuck.
- I know, Miriam.

1321
01:38:15,626 --> 01:38:19,571
Fuck.

1322
01:38:19,596 --> 01:38:25,811
But I'm a Christian
and my ears are not garbage cans.

1323
01:38:25,836 --> 01:38:27,479
Come on.

1324
01:38:27,504 --> 01:38:30,948
Oh, Edna.

1325
01:38:30,973 --> 01:38:34,485
- Then we shouldn't go after them.
- Then we won't.

1326
01:38:34,510 --> 01:38:36,854
- What's that?
- Sonny.

1327
01:38:36,879 --> 01:38:40,324
Could you come out, please?
Sonny?

1328
01:38:40,349 --> 01:38:42,360
- Shit.
- What?

1329
01:38:42,385 --> 01:38:45,730
- It's my mother.
- Sonny.

1330
01:38:45,755 --> 01:38:47,864
Someone here to see you. Sonny...

1331
01:38:47,889 --> 01:38:51,968
- ... could you come out, please?
- Oh, who needs this shit?

1332
01:38:51,993 --> 01:38:59,018
Sonny. Sonny,
could you come out, please?

1333
01:39:03,071 --> 01:39:06,549
Mom, what are you doing down here?

1334
01:39:06,574 --> 01:39:09,819
- I don't need you down here.
- Oh, Sonny.

1335
01:39:09,844 --> 01:39:13,355
All of Brooklyn is out here.
Three networks of television.

1336
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:17,026
- I got it all worked out, Ma.
- I talked to the man from the FBl.

1337
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:19,028
Who?
No, don't talk to anybody.

1338
01:39:19,053 --> 01:39:22,697
He says if you come out now,
everything is gonna be all right.

1339
01:39:22,722 --> 01:39:26,000
- I'm trying to get you out of this.
- Don't talk to the FBl.

1340
01:39:26,025 --> 01:39:27,502
I told them everything...

1341
01:39:27,527 --> 01:39:32,540
...how you were in the war in Vietnam,
I told them you always had good jobs.

1342
01:39:32,565 --> 01:39:36,010
I told them you were with Goldwater
in '64 in the convention and-

1343
01:39:36,035 --> 01:39:39,179
Listen, I'm getting a plane
and I'm going to Algeria.

1344
01:39:39,204 --> 01:39:41,382
- I'll write you from there.
- Algeria?

1345
01:39:41,407 --> 01:39:43,884
- I gotta get out of here.
- I don't understand.

1346
01:39:43,909 --> 01:39:47,187
If I stay and talk to you,
they won't send the limousine.

1347
01:39:47,212 --> 01:39:51,658
- They'll think I'll come out with you.
- What's the matter with that?

1348
01:39:51,683 --> 01:39:53,726
Because I'm not coming with you.

1349
01:39:53,751 --> 01:39:58,564
The FBl understands everything,
that it is not you that is doing this.

1350
01:39:58,589 --> 01:40:01,768
It's the pressures from your home life!

1351
01:40:01,793 --> 01:40:05,571
- Don't get on Angie now.
- Did I say one word against her?

1352
01:40:05,596 --> 01:40:08,775
You were going to. She has
nothing to do with it, it's me!

1353
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,043
Your life was sweetness and roses.
And you-

1354
01:40:12,068 --> 01:40:16,815
You wouldn't need Leon if Angie
was treating you right, you know that!

1355
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:20,685
I don't understand why you
wanna sleep with her anyway.

1356
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:23,221
You got two kids on welfare now.

1357
01:40:23,246 --> 01:40:28,392
- You want three kids on welfare?
- I can't talk to you about this now.

1358
01:40:28,417 --> 01:40:30,961
What are you gonna do?
All right, come out.

1359
01:40:30,986 --> 01:40:34,265
I can't come out. I can't.
Sal is in there with the people.

1360
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:37,201
- If I come out, he's gonna kill them.
- Oh, my God.

1361
01:40:37,226 --> 01:40:39,103
Run. Run.

1362
01:40:39,128 --> 01:40:42,572
Run? Where am I gonna run?
Ma, I can't run.

1363
01:40:42,597 --> 01:40:45,308
- Maybe-
- There's no maybe. No maybes.

1364
01:40:45,333 --> 01:40:48,478
You gotta go home. Where's Pop?
He didn't come, did he?

1365
01:40:48,503 --> 01:40:52,649
Is he pissed off at you!
He says he doesn't have a son.

1366
01:40:52,674 --> 01:40:54,918
- He says you're dead.
- He's right.

1367
01:40:54,943 --> 01:40:56,319
- No. No.
- Look, Ma...

1368
01:40:56,344 --> 01:40:59,454
...I'm a fuck-up and an outcast
and that's it.

1369
01:40:59,479 --> 01:41:03,091
You come near me, you're
gonna get fucked over and fucked out!

1370
01:41:03,116 --> 01:41:06,261
Now, I gotta go, Ma.
Get her home, okay?

1371
01:41:06,286 --> 01:41:07,963
Just take her home.

1372
01:41:07,988 --> 01:41:10,799
How beautiful you were
when you were a baby.

1373
01:41:10,824 --> 01:41:15,770
Go home now. Get her home now.

1374
01:41:15,795 --> 01:41:22,820
All right.

1375
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:30,994
Ten minutes.

1376
01:41:41,586 --> 01:41:44,397
Being of sound mind...

1377
01:41:44,422 --> 01:41:46,867
...and body...

1378
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:53,916
You know, what they...

1379
01:41:58,702 --> 01:42:02,348
To my darling wife...

1380
01:42:02,373 --> 01:42:07,385
...Leon...

1381
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:13,224
...whom I love...

1382
01:42:13,249 --> 01:42:15,660
...more than any man...

1383
01:42:15,685 --> 01:42:18,730
...has loved another man...

1384
01:42:18,755 --> 01:42:25,369
...in all eternity.

1385
01:42:25,394 --> 01:42:28,572
I leave...

1386
01:42:28,597 --> 01:42:34,077
...$2700...

1387
01:42:34,102 --> 01:42:41,126
...from my $10,000
life-insurance policy...

1388
01:42:41,409 --> 01:42:44,854
...to be used...

1389
01:42:44,879 --> 01:42:51,904
...for your sex-change operation.

1390
01:42:53,553 --> 01:42:59,634
If there is any money left over...

1391
01:42:59,659 --> 01:43:04,706
...I want it to go to you...

1392
01:43:04,731 --> 01:43:07,742
...at my first-

1393
01:43:07,767 --> 01:43:11,612
At the first anniversary
of my death...

1394
01:43:11,637 --> 01:43:18,662
...at my grave.

1395
01:43:22,615 --> 01:43:24,925
To my wife...

1396
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:27,994
...to my sweet wife...

1397
01:43:28,019 --> 01:43:32,765
...Angela...

1398
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:39,815
...$5000 from the same policy.

1399
01:43:41,833 --> 01:43:44,276
You are the only woman...

1400
01:43:44,301 --> 01:43:51,326
...that I ever loved.

1401
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:57,022
And I repledge my love to you...

1402
01:43:57,047 --> 01:44:04,071
...in this sad moment.

1403
01:44:06,789 --> 01:44:10,835
To little Kimmy...

1404
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:14,171
...and Timmy.

1405
01:44:14,196 --> 01:44:19,976
I hope you remember me, Timmy.

1406
01:44:20,001 --> 01:44:27,026
You are the little man
of the family now...

1407
01:44:31,179 --> 01:44:38,203
...and I hope
you look after them for me.

1408
01:44:38,685 --> 01:44:44,066
To my mother...

1409
01:44:44,091 --> 01:44:51,039
...I ask forgiveness.

1410
01:44:51,064 --> 01:44:56,244
You- You don't understand...

1411
01:44:56,269 --> 01:44:59,547
...the things I said...

1412
01:44:59,572 --> 01:45:04,185
...and did.

1413
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:11,234
But I'm me and I'm different.

1414
01:45:13,552 --> 01:45:20,577
I want a military funeral...

1415
01:45:20,858 --> 01:45:27,883
...and I'm entitled to have one,
free of charge.

1416
01:45:30,234 --> 01:45:34,713
God- God bless you...

1417
01:45:34,738 --> 01:45:40,385
...and watch over you...

1418
01:45:40,410 --> 01:45:47,435
...till we are joined in the hereafter.

1419
01:45:57,793 --> 01:46:04,818
Here, I'll sign.
I'll spell that last name.

1420
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:09,746
- Watch out!
- Watch out over here.

1421
01:46:09,771 --> 01:46:15,618
Look out over here. Watch it.

1422
01:46:15,643 --> 01:46:22,668
Come on, sarge, just one picture?

1423
01:46:25,286 --> 01:46:29,765
Back, back!

1424
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:36,815
All you guys, back up!

1425
01:46:56,682 --> 01:47:01,594
- You're the driver?
- Yeah.

1426
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:07,767
All right. I wanna check it out.

1427
01:47:07,792 --> 01:47:14,817
- These seats come out?
- No, they're bolted.

1428
01:47:18,101 --> 01:47:22,281
All right, here.
Light me on that side.

1429
01:47:22,306 --> 01:47:29,331
Give me light over there.

1430
01:47:29,413 --> 01:47:36,437
All right.

1431
01:47:36,752 --> 01:47:40,231
Jesus, you're the man, huh?

1432
01:47:40,256 --> 01:47:44,135
I was watching. I saw you, man.

1433
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:47,505
You should see yourself,
you wouldn't believe it.

1434
01:47:47,530 --> 01:47:50,874
- I believe it.
- Goddamn, Sheila won't believe it.

1435
01:47:50,899 --> 01:47:52,709
- Who's Sheila?
- My old lady.

1436
01:47:52,734 --> 01:47:55,011
They said, "Gas up a stretch...

1437
01:47:55,036 --> 01:47:58,648
- ... go to 285 Prospect Park West. "
- Give me some light over here.

1438
01:47:58,673 --> 01:48:05,697
I said, "Shit, another load
for the massage parlors. "

1439
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:20,436
It's okay.

1440
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:27,485
My man, I'm gonna remember you.

1441
01:48:29,769 --> 01:48:32,647
This is Agent Murphy.
He'll be your driver.

1442
01:48:32,672 --> 01:48:36,251
No, I want him.

1443
01:48:36,276 --> 01:48:39,419
- Give me the black guy.
- Hey, man, I ain't into that shit.

1444
01:48:39,444 --> 01:48:41,788
Nobody'll hurt you.

1445
01:48:41,813 --> 01:48:44,958
If they would've shot,
they would've shot already.

1446
01:48:44,983 --> 01:48:47,895
- I can't allow that, Sonny.
- You can't allow?

1447
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:52,599
What makes you think you can
say shit to me? I'm running this.

1448
01:48:52,624 --> 01:48:55,401
I'll pay you. What do you want?
A hundred? Two hundred?

1449
01:48:55,426 --> 01:48:58,304
A thousand? Come on.

1450
01:48:58,329 --> 01:49:01,607
Don't look at him, I'm running this.

1451
01:49:01,632 --> 01:49:05,177
Come on.

1452
01:49:05,202 --> 01:49:11,983
Look, it'll be an adventure.

1453
01:49:12,008 --> 01:49:19,033
You men that shoot,
aim for white meat.

1454
01:49:23,586 --> 01:49:26,631
Take a walk.

1455
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:29,967
Give me him.

1456
01:49:29,992 --> 01:49:33,938
You think you're dealing
with a fucking idiot?

1457
01:49:33,963 --> 01:49:40,444
Take a walk, cop!

1458
01:49:40,469 --> 01:49:47,493
Everybody is a con man. Come on.

1459
01:49:47,942 --> 01:49:51,321
I want everyone across the street.

1460
01:49:51,346 --> 01:49:53,956
I want them all back,
on the sidewalk!

1461
01:49:53,981 --> 01:49:56,092
Let's go!

1462
01:49:56,117 --> 01:50:01,630
At least I know
who I'm dealing with now.

1463
01:50:01,655 --> 01:50:08,680
Here's a pen for you. Come on.

1464
01:50:14,301 --> 01:50:19,680
Don't move, okay?

1465
01:50:19,705 --> 01:50:23,851
Sonny, here's your document.

1466
01:50:23,876 --> 01:50:29,123
- Right.
- Oh, you gotta sign it. Here.

1467
01:50:29,148 --> 01:50:32,792
We're taking off. We're going now.

1468
01:50:32,817 --> 01:50:35,495
Okay, Sal. Where is he? Sal?

1469
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,997
Sal.

1470
01:50:37,022 --> 01:50:39,532
That's it, we're going.

1471
01:50:39,557 --> 01:50:42,302
Here, people, let's go. We're going.

1472
01:50:42,327 --> 01:50:49,351
- Can I get my sweater?
- Get what you had when you came in.

1473
01:50:55,873 --> 01:50:59,718
Sal?

1474
01:50:59,743 --> 01:51:03,889
Sal.

1475
01:51:03,914 --> 01:51:06,190
- How you doing?
- Good.

1476
01:51:06,215 --> 01:51:09,560
- Good? We're gonna do it, right?
- Yeah.

1477
01:51:09,585 --> 01:51:11,696
We're gonna do it. Sal, see...

1478
01:51:11,721 --> 01:51:14,532
...you gotta keep your eye on him.
He's the driver.

1479
01:51:14,557 --> 01:51:17,068
- I need it.
- No, it's mine.

1480
01:51:17,093 --> 01:51:24,117
You gotta keep
your eye on him, Sal, see?

1481
01:51:24,332 --> 01:51:31,357
All right, where am I now?

1482
01:52:24,122 --> 01:52:26,934
All right, hold it. Hold it.

1483
01:52:26,959 --> 01:52:29,435
All right, let's go.

1484
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:32,872
Swing around now. Swing around.

1485
01:52:32,897 --> 01:52:39,922
Just keep holding hands.

1486
01:52:41,105 --> 01:52:44,382
Hold it.

1487
01:52:44,407 --> 01:52:47,385
Break it on "three. "
Not yet, don't break yet.

1488
01:52:47,410 --> 01:52:49,254
One...

1489
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:50,989
...two...

1490
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:58,039
- ... three. Go.
- Go.

1491
01:53:03,559 --> 01:53:05,936
Oh, fuck. We did it.

1492
01:53:05,961 --> 01:53:10,107
- We did it.
- Wish us luck.

1493
01:53:10,132 --> 01:53:13,644
Bye-bye.

1494
01:53:13,669 --> 01:53:20,693
- Okay, you got your one.
- Follow my car.

1495
01:53:29,584 --> 01:53:31,194
Sheldon here, get me Kennedy.

1496
01:53:31,219 --> 01:53:35,864
- Sal, we did it.
- Yeah.

1497
01:53:35,889 --> 01:53:38,834
I'll be a son of a bitch, we did it.

1498
01:53:38,859 --> 01:53:44,439
Okay, let's move.
Come on, honk the horn.

1499
01:53:44,464 --> 01:53:46,975
Hey, Sal, do me a favor, will you?

1500
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:54,024
Keep the gun pointed up.
We hit a bump, the gun'll go off.

1501
01:54:00,246 --> 01:54:05,026
All right. You set out there?

1502
01:54:05,051 --> 01:54:07,060
We're leaving now.

1503
01:54:07,085 --> 01:54:11,965
We want no trouble en route.

1504
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:15,969
- Intersection check?
- Check.

1505
01:54:15,994 --> 01:54:23,018
- All right. We'll be starting up right now.
- 10-4.

1506
01:54:51,427 --> 01:54:58,451
It's gonna be all right.

1507
01:55:18,653 --> 01:55:20,296
Sal.

1508
01:55:20,321 --> 01:55:27,346
Sal, you just gotta remember
to keep the gun pointed up.

1509
01:55:47,112 --> 01:55:52,793
You fucking-

1510
01:55:52,818 --> 01:55:59,843
Hey, let him go!

1511
01:57:50,395 --> 01:57:51,938
What's he doing?

1512
01:57:51,963 --> 01:57:58,987
He's still got some
arrangements to make.

1513
01:58:07,845 --> 01:58:10,389
- That's it?
- That's it.

1514
01:58:10,414 --> 01:58:17,438
Sal, see it? There it is.

1515
01:59:10,036 --> 01:59:11,880
Oh, I forgot.

1516
01:59:11,905 --> 01:59:18,853
I forgot to ask if they
got food on board.

1517
01:59:18,878 --> 01:59:25,903
They gonna have food on board?

1518
01:59:26,919 --> 01:59:30,364
There's your jet. We get one more now.
That's the deal.

1519
01:59:30,389 --> 01:59:33,167
Right. Okay, who goes?

1520
01:59:33,192 --> 01:59:36,169
Sylvia?

1521
01:59:36,194 --> 01:59:43,219
Maria.

1522
01:59:45,803 --> 01:59:48,815
I'll pray for you.

1523
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:50,583
Sal...

1524
01:59:50,608 --> 01:59:52,918
...because this is
your first plane trip...

1525
01:59:52,943 --> 01:59:59,968
...don't be scared, okay?

1526
02:00:09,058 --> 02:00:12,503
I didn't eat all day.
Will there be any food on board?

1527
02:00:12,528 --> 02:00:17,675
There'll be hamburgers. Ready?

1528
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:19,911
- Sal.
- What?

1529
02:00:19,936 --> 02:00:22,179
Ready to go?

1530
02:00:22,204 --> 02:00:27,751
Yeah.

1531
02:00:27,776 --> 02:00:32,522
Okay. Let's move it.

1532
02:00:32,547 --> 02:00:34,858
Sal...

1533
02:00:34,883 --> 02:00:38,261
...we don't want any accidents
at this point, right?

1534
02:00:38,286 --> 02:00:42,264
You keep your gun pointed up.

1535
02:00:42,289 --> 02:00:44,400
You ready to get out first?

1536
02:00:44,425 --> 02:00:50,906
I'm ready.

1537
02:00:50,931 --> 02:00:53,909
Don't shoot me.

1538
02:00:53,934 --> 02:00:56,711
Wait, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it, please.

1539
02:00:56,736 --> 02:00:58,379
Okay, it's safe. Come on.

1540
02:00:58,404 --> 02:01:05,429
Put him away, put him away.

1541
02:01:14,586 --> 02:01:21,611
All right, guys, move back.
Come on, back up.

1542
02:01:30,701 --> 02:01:37,016
Now spread them!

1543
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:39,952
No. No, we're all secure here.

1544
02:01:39,977 --> 02:01:47,001
Murphy will report from the car.

1545
02:01:47,350 --> 02:01:49,260
You make the report.

1546
02:01:49,285 --> 02:01:50,929
Put the gun down.

1547
02:01:50,954 --> 02:01:53,098
Back off.

1548
02:01:53,123 --> 02:01:57,202
Get up now, Sonny.
You're under arrest.

1549
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:59,604
You have the right to remain silent.

1550
02:01:59,629 --> 02:02:03,540
You have the right to an attorney
during your interrogation.

1551
02:02:03,565 --> 02:02:07,945
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1552
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:10,214
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer...

1553
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:17,264
...one will be appointed
to represent you if you wish one.

1554
02:02:27,088 --> 02:02:30,833
Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...

1555
02:02:30,858 --> 02:02:34,671
...until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?

1556
02:02:34,696 --> 02:02:35,937
Repeat:

1557
02:02:35,962 --> 02:02:39,641
Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...

1558
02:02:39,666 --> 02:02:44,146
...until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?

1559
02:02:44,171 --> 02:02:51,196
Yeah, I got you.
We'll hold here.
