Everyone remembers
their first job.

24
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,901
This is the story of mine.

25
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,243
I was the youngest
in a family of overachievers.

26
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,532
My father was a world-famous
art historian,

27
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,292
and my brother was ahead
of me in everything.

28
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,875
I was always the disappointment.

29
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:58,088
I found my solace in the small cinema
I went to every Thursday night.

30
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,220
Alfred Hitchcock. Orson Welles.
Laurence Olivier.

31
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,222
These were my heroes.

32
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,600
I wanted to be a part of their world.

33
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,888
When I was 23, I got my chance.

34
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,273
Colin, come in.
Have you met James and Anna,

35
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,775
- my two very brilliant pupils?
- Hello.

36
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,904
- I'm off to London now, Pa.
- Your silly job interview.

37
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,110
Well, bonne chance, dear boy.

38
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,991
I can always get you
a research position at the V&A

39
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:28,451
once you've grown up a bit and got this
film idea out of your system.

40
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,365
- So I'm off now, Ma.
- Off?

41
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,082
- My job interview, Mother.
- Oh! Can't you stay for dinner?

42
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,212
There's nothing to eat, but I'm sure
the conversation will be charming.

43
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,338
I don't want to be late in the morning.

44
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,922
I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be
a famous film director in no time.

45
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,758
I had everything to prove to my
family, but more to prove to myself.

46
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,435
Like every young man,
I had to make my own way.

47
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,931
So I decided to leave home

48
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,146
and join the circus.

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,608
- What do you want?
- A job on your next film.

50
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,192
You're an actor, aren't you?

51
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,948
No, I want to work
on the production side.

52
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,326
We don't start shooting
for another eight weeks.

53
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,988
- Come back nearer the time.
- May I wait until there's a job?

54
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,335
Vanessa!

55
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,716
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,266
There are no jobs.

57
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,177
I'll come back tomorrow
morning just in case.

58
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,346
It's a free country.

59
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,773
- Good morning.
- You're very determined.

60
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,658
Well, I'd do anything
to be in the film business.

61
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,320
Anything?

62
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,830
Sir Laurence Olivier Productions.

63
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,662
No, I'm afraid he's at Notley
till the end of the week.

64
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,871
- Vanessa asked me to...
- Oh, did she?

65
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,508
I need a number for Noel Coward.
It won't be in the book.

66
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,475
- Hello, Vivien.
- Hello.

67
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,733
- Sir Laurence.
- Hughie!

68
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,065
Simply impossible to get Marilyn Monroe
on the telephone.

69
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,323
The darling girl spends
the entire day asleep.

70
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,734
- Hello, boy. Remind me.
- Darling, you remember Colin.

71
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,825
- You met him at the Clark's party.
- Of course. What are you doing here?

72
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,580
You said there might be a job
on your film.

73
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,493
Have a cigarette.
Keep the pack.

74
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,911
Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,253
There won't be a film unless Miss Monroe
gets her splendid posterior out of bed.

76
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,712
The house committee is threatening
to withhold Miller's passport.

77
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,752
They say he's a communist.
No Arthur, no Marilyn.

78
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,467
I'll have a word with
the American ambassador.

79
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:53,225
I'm taking him to see Vivien's play on
Thursday. Terry's rewrites, are they in?

80
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,511
Not all of them, of course.
When did that ever happen?

81
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,682
He's the first actor since du Maurier
to have his own brand.

82
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,523
They pay him an absolute fortune.
I'm afraid they're rather ghastly.

83
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,439
Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?

84
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,277
I suppose he's all right.

85
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:13,036
Darling, you must do something for
Colin. You absolutely promised.

86
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,242
Hughie, let's try to
find him something to do.

87
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,623
- Yes. Of course.
- Come on, darling.

88
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,454
You'll look after my precious
Larrykins, won't you?

89
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,711
- Come on, darling.
- Christ.

90
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,213
Do you like it?

91
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,748
That's absolutely splendid.

92
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,463
- You were absolutely born for it.
- Door.

93
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,423
Sorry.

94
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,010
And could you turn
all the way around, my darling?

95
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,175
- Thank you.
- This is the dress Larry likes.

96
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,685
- There?
- The camera's ravishing you.

97
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,642
Oh, dear. That sounds serious.

98
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,932
- That's wonderful.
- Too much?

99
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,476
- Oh, God. Not for me.
- Arthur Jacobs,

100
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,144
Miss Monroe's publicist,
is flying in tomorrow.

101
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,279
He wants to see the house
where she'll be staying.

102
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,065
Find something suitable.

103
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,154
- Yes, sir.
- More importantly,

104
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,617
- how does it make you feel?
- And leave the bloody tea.

105
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,156
Oh. Sorry.

106
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:03,537
Out of the question. I can't have
a lot of awful film people traveling

107
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,376
- through the house in dirty boots.
- But we'd be paying

108
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,666
a hundred pounds per week
for 18 weeks.

109
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,176
- My wife would never agree.
- That's a pity, Mr. Cotes-Preedy.

110
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,679
I'll have to tell Miss Monroe
to look elsewhere, then.

111
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,262
- Marilyn Monroe?
- Yes.

112
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,054
Suppose I'd have to be introduced.

113
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:27,986
Good morning, Mr. Jacobs.
Hope you had a pleasant flight.

114
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,316
Is this the fucking car?

115
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,708
Who built this place?
Hansel and Gretel?

116
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,870
It's one of the best houses
in the area.

117
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,959
All right. We'll take it.

118
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,715
But ditch the wallpaper.
It's giving me a migraine.

119
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,013
That house was perfect for Marilyn.

120
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,174
- Can't use it now.
- Yes, we can.

121
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,552
I knew that Cotes-Preedy
wouldn't be able to keep this quiet,

122
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,766
so that's why when you asked me
to find a house for Miss Monroe,

123
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,351
I took the precaution of finding two.

124
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,233
So the other one, Parkside,
is much better.

125
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,894
And the owner is very discreet.

126
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,905
So we've got two expensive houses now
where we only needed one.

127
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,737
I thought that someone else
on the production might want it.

128
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,151
Oh, did you?

129
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,411
I guess Milton could use it

130
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,913
and it's near the studio. Near Marilyn.

131
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,918
What are we paying you, boy?

132
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,546
- Nothing, sir.
- Let's see to it, Hughie.

133
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,207
Well done, boy.

134
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,425
Nice job, kid.

135
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,432
Colin Clark,
Laurence Olivier Productions.

136
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,898
The film was then
called The Sleeping Prince.

137
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,019
Marilyn was to play a naive American
showgirl called Elsie Marina

138
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,440
who is seduced by an Eastern-European
prince played by Olivier.

139
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,529
It was the lightest of comedies.

140
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,040
- You in the union?
- No.

141
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,825
Then you can't have a job on the film.

142
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,540
Well, how do I get into the union?

143
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,250
By getting a job on the film.

144
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,006
It's called a closed shop.

145
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,544
I suppose I might be able
to do something for you.

146
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:19,465
The union owe me a few favors.
We don't have a third yet.

147
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:24,306
- A third?
- Third assistant director.

148
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,814
- You do know what the job is?
- Assisting the director?

149
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,975
That's the last thing you do!

150
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,862
third's job is to
do whatever the fuck I tell him.

151
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,316
And what are you waiting for?

152
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,612
Colin!

153
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,282
don't shit
on your own doorstep.

154
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,290
- Got it?
- Got it.

155
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,454
The third always stays nearby.

156
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,748
Not in some bloody palace in London.

157
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,087
Book a room at
The Dog & Duck down the road.

158
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,798
It's a bit rough. You'll get used to it.

159
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,385
Now make yourself useful.
Marilyn needs a bodyguard.

160
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,891
Sort something out.

161
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,432
I'm sure you understand the sensitive
nature of the job, Superintendent.

162
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,019
Something about looking
after a cinema actress?

163
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,026
Well, not just any actress.
Marilyn Monroe.

164
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,482
I never had much time
for the pictures.

165
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,863
Excellent.

166
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,024
For the next four months,

167
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:22,035
you never leave her side.
Day or night.

168
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,242
Her behavior is reputedly
a little erratic.

169
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,748
- She drinks?
- Amongst other things.

170
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,626
- Pills?
- It would be useful if you could, uh,

171
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,038
keep us informed of
her domestic situation.

172
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,126
You want me to spy on her.

173
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,542
Well, the odd early warning
if you know she's going to be late.

174
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,381
That kind of thing.

175
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,562
Hello.

176
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,223
Colin Clark. I booked a room.

177
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,984
Ah, right. Here you are.

178
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,861
Sign this.

179
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,239
What brings you up this way?

180
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,025
I'm working on a film at Pinewood.

181
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,784
Oh. What film is that?

182
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,413
It's called The Sleeping Prince. With
Sir Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe,

183
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,747
so I'll be working with them.

184
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,831
Room's three quid a week.
First week in advance.

185
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,621
Number two.

186
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,509
And, uh, hope you don't mind,
you'll be sharing with Grace Kelly.

187
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,942
This'll work fine for Marilyn. Oh, and,
uh, Paula will need the room next door.

188
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,107
- I beg your pardon?
- Sorry, who is Paula?

189
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,867
Strasberg. Marilyn's acting coach.

190
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,528
She's nuts about the Method.

191
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,947
Arthur, we've spoken about this before.

192
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,162
Stanislavski and the Method are
perfectly fine in the rehearsal room,

193
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,453
but they don't belong on a film set.

194
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,916
Time is too tight.

195
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,543
Larry! Some good news.

196
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,962
House committee have decided
Miller isn't a communist after all.

197
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,380
Of course he is.

198
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,641
All those pain in the ass
New York intellectuals are Reds.

199
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,803
Which means she'll be flying
in next week on schedule.

200
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,313
- Excellent news.
- She'll have to be met.

201
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,475
Well, naturally Vivien and I
will be there to greet her,

202
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,065
but let's keep it low key, shall we?

203
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,480
You join us here at London Airport,

204
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,115
where it is absolute mayhem.

205
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,492
Marilyn! This way! Get out of the way!

206
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,348
With her is her new husband,
America's most celebrated playwright

207
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,013
and author of Death of a Salesman,
Arthur Miller.

208
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,851
Beautiful. You're looking at
tomorrow's front page, boys.

209
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,020
- We'll have to get them into the hall.
- Sir Laurence Olivier

210
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,656
and Scarlett O'Hara herself,
Vivien Leigh, are set to greet them.

211
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:09,285
American acting royalty
meeting British acting royalty.

212
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,035
Gentlemen, it is my especial pleasure

213
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,202
to introduce a woman
who clearly needs no introduction.

214
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,541
Marilyn! How do you like being married?

215
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,880
Well, I like it. I like it a lot.

216
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,383
- Is this third time lucky?
- You bet it is.

217
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,045
Is it true you want to be
a classical actress now?

218
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,134
Well, I want to be
the best actress I can be.

219
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,051
There's a rumor you're going to be in
The Brothers Karamazov, on Broadway.

220
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,187
Ooh.
I'm... considering it.

221
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,563
Which of them will you be playing?

222
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,315
I'll be playing Grushenka.

223
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,477
- Can you spell that?
- Sure. Can you?

224
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,820
Vivien, you created
the role of Elsie on stage.

225
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,905
Have you any advice for Marilyn?

226
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,320
I am sure if Miss Monroe
needs any advice,

227
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,409
she'll get it from her director.

228
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,371
I hear he's terribly good.

229
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,785
Marilyn!

230
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,126
Are you happy with your last film?

231
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,383
Marilyn!

232
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,420
Is it true you wear nothing
in bed except perfume?

233
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,553
Ooh.

234
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,512
Darling, as I'm in England, let's say I
sleep in nothing but Yardley's Lavender.

235
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,320
Smile, Marilyn!

236
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,956
OK, let's get a snap of the newlyweds.

237
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,788
Smile, Arthur. It's not a firing squad.

238
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,795
This is some place you found.

239
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,126
You have my new assistant
Colin to thank for that.

240
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,134
Colin, this is Milton Greene.
You must be very nice to him.

241
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,795
He owns half of
Marilyn Monroe Productions.

242
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,964
- Forty-nine percent, Larry.
- Have a cigarette.

243
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,928
- I don't smoke.
- Really?

244
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,687
- And the studio, they want a new title.
- Nonsense.

245
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,602
Thank you very much.

246
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,150
Marvelous, isn't she?

247
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,986
- She's all right.
- Larry fell desperately

248
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,776
in love with her in New York.
He's determined to seduce her.

249
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,071
Yeah, but she's only
been married three weeks.

250
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,661
I thought you were a man of the world.

251
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,541
Of course, Larry would never leave me,

252
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,373
but if anything were to happen
you would tell me, wouldn't you?

253
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,003
- I'm sure he loves you very much.
- Oh, don't be such a boy.

254
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,463
I'm 43, darling.

255
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:36,182
No one will love me for very much
longer. Not even you.

256
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,908
What a wonderful adventure,
Dame Sybil.

257
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,535
Such a lark.

258
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,038
I long to see her.

259
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,725
Miss Monroe?

260
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,558
Sir Laurence sends his compliments.
He's ready for the read-through.

261
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,438
But Marilyn is not ready.

262
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,978
She's preparing.

263
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,736
Excuse my horrible face.

264
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,285
Ah! Marilyn, my dear.

265
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,452
Everyone is so excited to meet you.

266
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,788
Do... Come along, my darling, my angel.

267
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,413
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Marilyn Monroe.

268
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,253
- Marilyn.
- How lovely you are.

269
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,635
- Here, I kept a place for you.
- I have to be next to Marilyn.

270
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,262
What a good idea.
I wish we could all bring a friend.

271
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,719
One does get so terribly nervous.

272
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,180
It's just like the first day
at school, isn't it?

273
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,188
So, welcome, dear Marilyn,

274
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,691
to our little fraternity.

275
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,102
We may seem a little strange

276
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,613
and, uh, quaint to you at first,

277
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,649
but I hope that in time,

278
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,866
you may come to find your
method in our madness.

279
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,373
So, my very noble
and approved good masters,

280
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,456
may we strive to create a work of art

281
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,747
that, led by your good graces,

282
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,916
will be cherished

283
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:36,632
as long as motion pictures

284
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,464
may be remembered.

285
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,228
Were you surprised
to get my invitation?

286
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,889
I'll say I was surprised.

287
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,275
I was so surprised, I couldn't
hardly think you meant me.

288
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,185
Oh, but of course I meant you.

289
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,322
I had your name most carefully
marked down in my program.

290
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,904
In matters of this kind,
I assure you I'm most methodical.

291
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,444
Who would you think I meant if not you?

292
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,494
Gee, Mr. Sir, I could just
listen to your accent all day.

293
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,375
Oh, you darling, Marilyn.

294
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,127
You're amongst friends now.

295
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,630
Just plain "Larry" will suffice, really.

296
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,462
That's so sweet.
Um, whenever you're ready.

297
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,547
Well, Maisie Springfield.

298
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,804
No, not Maisie Springfield.

299
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,841
She is quite what
I would call "old hat."

300
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,260
Remember why you're
in the embassy, Marilyn.

301
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,145
What does the Grand Duke
want from Elsie?

302
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,308
You came here and you thought...

303
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,396
...from experience, Marilyn.

304
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,653
It's only a read-through, Paula.

305
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,691
Marilyn has to begin
finding the character.

306
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,609
Oh, the character's on the page.

307
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,995
The words, maybe. Not the character.

308
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,366
Aren't we going to have fun?

309
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,463
Well, we'll pick it up
whenever you like.

310
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,749
- We should talk. Just us.
- Yeah.

311
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,041
Thank you so much.

312
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,135
We can't have two fucking directors!

313
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,547
- Marilyn wants Paula.
- Why? She's got me.

314
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,807
Paula's costing us two and a half
thousand bucks a week.

315
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,889
We might as well use her.
Listen, Larry.

316
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,680
Accept Marilyn on her
own terms and you'll be OK.

317
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,564
Try to change her
and she will drive you crazy.

318
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:16,068
- Trust me.
- Christ, what have I got myself into?

319
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,237
- Come out with me tonight.
- I'm working.

320
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,569
- Well, tomorrow night, then.
- I'm washing my hair.

321
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,907
- But your hair's lovely.
- Look, I've got two rules.

322
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,571
Everyone has a lot of rules around here.

323
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,910
One, never touch the talent,

324
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,701
and two, never go out with thirds.

325
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,039
Why not?

326
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,297
Because they're all randy little buggers
who just want some fun during shooting.

327
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,456
I'm not like that.

328
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,385
Really.

329
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,881
I'm free on Saturday.

330
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,182
Colin!

331
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,184
Quiet on set, everyone!

332
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,527
How kind of you to meet us.
Dear me, you do look cold.

333
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,234
They're ready for you
in makeup, Dame Sybil.

334
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,320
How exciting. Don't you love
the first day of a new production?

335
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,735
I don't know, Dame Sybil.
I've never had one before.

336
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,620
Oh, to be young again.

337
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,796
She has kept Dame Sybil Thorndike

338
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,049
and the entire company
waiting in full costume

339
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:24,383
for two hours, Mr. Orton,
and it is simply not fair.

340
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,613
I can't do this.

341
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,619
- What's wrong?
- She's nervous.

342
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,534
I'll deal with it.

343
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,499
Would you like to sit down,
Dame Sybil?

344
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,417
Oh, yes. Colin, how kind.

345
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,929
- Why don't we all sit down.
- Oi!

346
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,384
That chair is a prop.

347
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,844
- Props are NATKE.
- But I was...

348
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,682
If ACTT members are gonna start doing
NATKE jobs, I'm calling my men out!

349
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,845
- He's right.
- Right.

350
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,764
I'm sure we're all good
union members here.

351
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,728
There's no need to fall out
over something so trivial.

352
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,987
It might be trivial to you,
Dame Sybil, but it's my livelihood!

353
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,115
Put the chair down. Now!

354
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,243
I rather think you've made your point.

355
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,075
Solidarity is the most
important thing here.

356
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,082
When unions fall out,
it's management that benefits.

357
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,918
If I see you doing a NATKE job again,

358
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,671
I will close this set down
quicker than you can blink.

359
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,457
- Dave!
- Yes?

360
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,001
Dame Sybil would like a chair.

361
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,886
Right. There you are.

362
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,841
I was on the picket lines
in 1926, you know.

363
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,637
Now that really was a strike.
We were all Bolsheviks then.

364
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,102
Ready. Camera running.

365
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,231
- Very quiet, everyone.
- Speed.

366
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,398
Five, take one.

367
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,654
Action.

368
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,490
Now, before you meet
my mother-in-law,

369
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:16,078
I must remind you she's a little vague
and can be very deaf on occasion.

370
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,538
My dear, such boredom.

371
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:22,079
The decorations hideous
and the music catastrophe.

372
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,465
Our friend, the ex-king
of Moravia, drove me home.

373
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,341
He's now called the Duke of Strelitz.

374
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,127
He cannot, of course,
go to the abbey tomorrow,

375
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,216
but he's most anxious you
should invite him to the room

376
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,097
you have taken at the Ritz for Nicky.

377
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,883
- Maud?
- Yes, ma'am?

378
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,770
There you are. I didn't see you. Give me
a glass of champagne I see over there.

379
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,683
- Olga Bosnia...
- Might I present Miss Elsie Marina?

380
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,819
Yes, my dear, of course.
I remember you well.

381
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,784
- Gee, I forgot my line.
- That's a cut.

382
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,574
- I'm sorry.
- It's so easily done, isn't it?

383
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,617
I'm sure I went wrong somewhere there.

384
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,206
- Shall we have another go, Larry?
- Of course.

385
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,291
Action.

386
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,421
Yes, my dear, of course.

387
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,255
- I remember you well.
- Oh, I'm quite sure you don't,

388
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,215
Your Royal...

389
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,005
I mean Your, uh, Imperial, uh...

390
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,301
- ...Serene Majesty?
- What does she say?

391
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,392
She says she's flattered and compliments
you on your wonderful memory.

392
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,228
I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.

393
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,148
Didn't I have a line somewhere there?

394
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,028
Cut.

395
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,698
- Action.
- Sweetly pretty.

396
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,700
She should use more mascara.

397
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,112
When one is young,
one should use a lot of mascara.

398
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,623
When one is old,
one should use much more.

399
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:45,004
- What do you do, my dear?
- I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.

400
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,256
- Dear?
- She says she's an actress.

401
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,968
- Cut it there.
- Print.

402
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,095
- Check the gate.
- Gate's good.

403
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,975
That was perfect, Marilyn.

404
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,478
You were Elsie to the life.

405
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,982
I wonder, could we practice
our lines together later?

406
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,313
You'd be doing me such a kindness.

407
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,070
At my great age,
it's just so hard to make them stick.

408
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,982
- Why don't you come for tea tomorrow.
- Can I?

409
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,903
Sure.

410
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,908
She's impossible.
I should've cast Vivien.

411
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:25,999
If anyone can make her great,
it's you, sir.

412
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,256
Well let's just hope I'm as
brilliant as you think I am.

413
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,712
Now be a good boy
and keep an eye on her.

414
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,876
Yes, sir.

415
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,381
I can't
figure this stupid movie out.

416
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,050
You were wonderful, Marilyn. The
most gifted actress I have ever known.

417
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,720
- No.
- You were superb, Marilyn.

418
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,981
You were divine.
Have faith in your talent.

419
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,358
He was disappointed in me.

420
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,144
You are a great, great actress.

421
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,315
All my life, I have prayed for a great
actress I could help and guide.

422
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,236
- Oh!
- Like this, I prayed to God,

423
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,951
on my knees, and he has given me you.

424
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,867
You are that great actress, Marilyn.

425
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,909
Trust yourself.
Trust your talent.

426
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,044
- Come on, Paula, get up.
- No.

427
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,421
Not until you admit that you were great!

428
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,081
Oh!

429
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,379
- OK!
- Yes!

430
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,387
- I guess I was.
- Of course you were.

431
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,923
- There you are. Sorry.
- Thank you.

432
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,262
You really were very good, Miss Monroe.

433
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,519
Oh, thank you.

Are you sure you can afford all this?

441
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,964
It's fine.

442
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,750
Must be costing you a week's wages.

443
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,213
You are worth it.

444
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,638
You're not the average third, are you?

445
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,548
I'm not living off my parents,
if that's what you mean.

446
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,092
I want to make my own way.

447
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,226
Will you be signing
on your father's account, sir?

448
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,353
Um, no, I'm gonna pay cash.

449
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,890
- Thank you.
- There you are, sir.

450
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,776
I was always going to pay, you know.

451
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,777
'Course you were.

452
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,484
Do you think Marilyn's beautiful?

453
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,196
Not compared to you.

454
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,285
You don't have to try so hard
to be charming.

455
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,792
You're nice enough as it is.

456
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,829
Well, you could be.

457
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,177
Wait a while, crocodile.

458
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,059
But I really do like you, Lucy.

459
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,846
Maybe. That's my dad.

460
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,898
Time to be thinking about bed,
darling. Early start tomorrow.

461
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,737
Sorry, Daddy. We're just going
over tomorrow's schedule.

462
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,742
Yes, I should be off, sir.

463
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,529
Uh, Colin Clark. Lovely
to meet you, Mr. Armstrong.

464
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:08,449
This is a great place you have here.

465
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,709
Do you know this part of the world?

466
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,120
Um, no. My family
are more country people.

467
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,836
Oh. Well, good night.

468
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,045
Good night.

469
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,889
- Next Saturday?
- Yeah.

470
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,223
- Good morning, Dame Sybil.
- Colin, dear.

471
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,484
I thought you looked cold
so I bought you this.

472
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,736
- Thank you, Dame Sybil.
- Film sets and rehearsal rooms

473
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,238
are coldest places on Earth.

474
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,287
She should be on time
like everyone else.

475
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,164
- She's a star.
- I'm a fucking star.

476
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,620
She's the greatest
piece of ass on Earth.

477
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,252
With tits like that,
you make allowances.

478
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,379
Marilyn, my darling,

479
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,165
you are an angel
and I kiss the hem of your garment,

480
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,085
but why can't you get here on
time for the love of fuck?!

481
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:05,006
Oh.
You have that word in England, too.

482
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,596
Marilyn has to prepare properly.

483
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,932
Acting isn't just a case
of putting on a costume or a false nose.

484
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,471
You must apologize to Dame Sybil.

485
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:17,601
Sybil?

486
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,115
- I'm so sorry.
- My dear, you mustn't concern yourself.

487
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,871
A great actress like you has
many other things on her mind.

488
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,078
You think I'm a great actress?

489
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,870
None of the rest of us truly
know how to act for the camera,

490
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,881
but you do. It's a rare gift.

491
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,881
This poor girl hasn't had
your years of experience.

492
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,048
She's in a strange country
acting a strange part.

493
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,841
Now, are you helping or bullying?

494
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,387
Oh, thank you.

495
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,646
Before you meet my mother-in-law,

496
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,439
I must warn you she's a little vague
and can be very deaf on occasions.

497
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,573
Uh, two is good, Jack. Yeah.

498
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,280
OK, let's cut it there.

499
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,991
- Speed.
- Five, take one.

500
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,201
- OK.
- Action.

501
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,493
When one is old,
one should use much more.

502
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:19,505
- What do you do, my dear?
- I'm The Coconut...

503
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:22,462
And once again, please.
Keep rolling.

504
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:25,719
- I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.
- Excellent.

505
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,926
I do need you to keep your eyes
open if you can, my angel.

506
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,682
Paula, would you give the line, please?

507
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,184
Wait, I know it.

508
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,596
I'm in The Coconut Girl on the Avenue.

509
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,266
- At the Avenue.
- I'm at the Avenue.

510
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,105
It's not at the Avenue.

511
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,487
Uh, Sybil, would you
give her the line again?

512
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,194
- Thank you.
- What do you do, my dear?

513
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,485
I'm in The Coconut Girl at the Avenue.

514
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,750
That one's pretty dam n good.
You knocked it outta the park.

515
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,036
- She says she's an actress.
- When Marilyn gets it right,

516
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,330
you just don't wanna
look at anyone else.

517
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,373
Cut it there.

518
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,136
We've only been shooting for four days.
Already, we're two weeks behind.

519
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,098
So why not only show her the good takes.
She might feel better about herself.

520
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,354
Well, the kid's right.
She could use the confidence.

521
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,516
No one's forcing her to watch.
Besides, she's an experienced actress.

522
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,561
- She should learn from her mistakes.
- But they only upset her.

523
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,230
Not half so much as they upset me!

524
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,569
Leave all that.
Go and find Marilyn's script.

525
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,283
Paula thinks she's left it
in her dressing room.

526
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,993
Yes.

527
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,882
- Your script...
- Oh, I found it.

528
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,851
You can go now, Colin.

529
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,200
David wants to know if you're ready
for the extras in the ballroom scene.

530
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,832
T ell him he can start
sending them up. Women first.

531
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,796
I'm looking forward to Saturday.

532
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,713
- Our date.
- Oh, I completely forgot.

533
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,629
I can't do Saturday.
Marilyn wants to go shopping.

534
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,672
Since when do you work for her?

535
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,135
Next Friday instead.

536
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,894
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll pick you up. Eight o'clock.

537
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,983
- Gee, it's quiet.
- Sure is.

538
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,152
It's a Saturday, so it's early closing,
but at least she can shop in peace.

539
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,948
That's awfully pretty.
Every building here looks like a castle.

540
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,242
Oh, I think so.

541
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,705
Look.

542
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,370
- It's Marilyn!
- It's Marilyn Monroe!

543
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,211
- OK.
- It's her!

544
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,383
Slow down.
You'll get your autograph.

545
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,514
- Whoa!
- You're so kind!

546
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,472
Boy, you're awfully excited.

547
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,386
- OK, guys, let's keep calm.
- Marilyn!

548
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,521
- Hold back a little.
- It's for my son.

549
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,307
Wait your turn!

550
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:31,230
This is too much.

551
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,818
- Oh!
- Colin, get in the car!

552
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,358
Stand back a few feet, please.

553
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,543
Jeez, Marilyn, they really love you.

554
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,223
Well, we're still
the first ones, aren't we?

555
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,270
Gee, this is all right, isn't it?

556
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,809
Cut. Uh, the line is,
"Gee, this is all right, too, isn't it?"

557
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,318
It's a tiny word, my darling,
but it does matter. So we'll...

558
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,946
We'll do it again. Once more, please,
straight away. Thank you so much.

559
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,902
- All right, as soon as we can.
- Turn over.

560
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,696
Well, we're still
the first ones, aren't we?

561
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:23,991
- Gee, this is all right, isn't it?
- Cut.

562
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,744
- Can't we just drop it?
- Well, the thing is, darling,

563
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,915
you've already admired the downstairs
hall in the earlier scene,

564
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:35,552
and now you're admiring
this room as well.

565
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:36,882
If you see what I mean?

566
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:41,054
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

567
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,186
- Turn over.
- Paula?

568
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,766
Christ.

569
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,932
I don't get it.

570
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,600
He's such a strange man,
I think she's already figured out

571
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,770
that he only invited her here
to sleep with him.

572
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,609
I... What...
So, what is the...?

573
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,944
The reason Marilyn can't
remember the line

574
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,155
is because she doesn't believe
the situation her character is in.

575
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,947
Then she should pretend to believe it.

576
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,241
"Pretend"? We're talking
about the difference

577
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,956
between the truth and artificial crap.

578
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,246
We're in absolute agreement.
Acting is all about truth,

579
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,130
and if you can fake that,
you'll have a jolly good career.

580
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,087
Maybe we should try for another take.

581
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,378
Marilyn needs time
to give a great performance.

582
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,796
You should give her as long as it takes.

583
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,805
Chaplin took eight months
to make a movie.

584
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,058
Eight months of this?

585
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,640
- I'd rather kill myself.
- Oh!

586
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,142
I can't do this.

587
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,436
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

588
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,980
You can do it. You can't fail.

589
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,865
You'll have more pain,
you will suffer more,

590
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:43,199
but you will create.
All you need is time.

591
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,955
Think about the things
you like instead of him.

592
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,583
Frank Sinatra. Hmm?

593
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,165
Coca-Cola.

594
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,456
Use your substitutions
and make it work for you.

595
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,749
- OK.
- OK.

596
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,339
Two-eight-one, take 17.

597
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:04,929
Oh, we're still the first ones,
aren't we?

598
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:09,437
Gee, this is all right, too, isn't it?

599
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,976
Then she goes...
She...

600
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,569
Cut! What is the matter now?

601
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,324
You wait! Marilyn, please.

602
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,826
Please, tell me how I can help you.

603
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:27,034
I don't know who Elsie is, and I can't
act her if I don't know who she is.

604
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,451
You have her precisely. You understand
her inside out. I'm in awe of your gift.

605
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,495
- We all are.
- She's not real.

606
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:38,588
Then why not simply rely
on your natural talents?

607
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,221
So are you saying you
don't want me to act?

608
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,509
Marilyn, will you just try to be sexy.
Isn't that what you do?

609
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,387
I want Lee.

610
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,394
I want Lee.

611
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,399
- You've already got Paula...
- I want Lee!

612
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,901
- I'm the director.
- I'm Lee's representative.

613
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,983
It's 5:00 in the morning in New York.

614
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,363
I want Lee!

615
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,485
Oh, now forever,

616
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:08,155
farewell the tranquil mind,

617
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,995
farewell content...

618
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,751
Farewell the plumed troops

619
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:19,918
and the big wars that make
ambition virtue. Oh, farewell!

620
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,793
Paula's not an actress!

621
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,586
She's not a director,
she's not a teacher!

622
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,721
Her only talent is buttering up Marilyn!

623
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,635
Larry, she needs her people.
We're the only family she's ever had.

624
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,055
Do you know what would make Marilyn
Monroe a real actor? A season in rep.

625
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,565
They wouldn't stand for this nonsense
at the Hippodrome in Eastbourne.

626
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,600
Larry, you have to be patient with her.

627
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:41,488
Trying to teach Marilyn how to act
is like teaching Urdu to a badger!

628
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:48,153
I better go see her. She'll need
something to help her calm down.

629
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,996
Christ! Pills to sleep.
Pills to wake up.

630
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,751
Pills to calm her down.
Pills to give her energy.

631
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,164
No wonder she's permanently
ten feet underwater!

632
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,883
- Maybe she's scared.
- We're all scared!

633
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,091
I've spent half of my professional life
in abject bloody terror!

634
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,006
It's what actors do!

635
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,469
But you have the training
to deal with it, sir.

636
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,477
I wouldn't buy the "little
girl lost" act if I were you.

637
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,230
Though heaven knows, it's tempting.

638
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,643
I think Marilyn knows
exactly what she's doing.

639
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:30,245
Look, you better get over to Parkside
and make sure the poor girl's all right.

640
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,633
Marilyn's OK. She's taken
some pills and gone to bed.

641
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:51,720
They like to keep her doped up.
It makes her easier to control.

642
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,892
They're terrified their
cash cow will slip away.

643
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,726
Cheers.

644
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,865
Why does everybody
always think I'm crazy?

645
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm not crazy.

646
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,655
Marilyn, come back to bed.

647
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,995
It's not about you.
It's not what you think.

648
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,835
It's just a few ideas.

649
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,543
Writer stuff.

650
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:17,394
Come on, let's get some sleep
and bring back my book.

651
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,025
Don't touch me.

652
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,413
Good morning, Miss Monroe.

653
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,961
- It's nearly lunchtime.
- She's not feeling the part.

654
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,051
It's a light comedy. How much
feeling can it possibly require?

655
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,716
Just give her a few minutes, Larry.

656
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,556
Boy, will you find out what
the hell is going on, please?

657
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,040
It's Colin. Come in.

658
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,713
Are you all right, Miss Monroe?

659
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,928
- How old are you?
- Twenty-four.

660
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,594
Nearly. I'm... I'm 23.
I'm nearly 24.

661
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,647
Do you know you remind us of
the young king in the movie?

662
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,777
And so...

663
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,238
...uh... sweet.

664
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,574
And innocent.

665
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,240
I'm not sure I'm that innocent.

666
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,671
So, what's your job on this picture?

667
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:12,174
I'm the third assistant director.
So, it's a gofer, really.

668
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,427
"Go for this, go for that."

669
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,381
But you're Larry's assistant, too.

670
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,390
Yes.

671
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,519
What were you doing
in my house last night?

672
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,189
Did he send you?

673
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,770
He was worried about you.

674
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,107
Are you spying on me?

675
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,071
No, of course not.
Why would anyone spy on you?

676
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,037
Colin.

677
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,378
Whose side are you on?

678
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,671
Yours, Miss Monroe.

679
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,888
Call me Marilyn.

680
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,485
Marilyn's got a new boyfriend.

681
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,659
- Larry will get jealous.
- Nothing happened.

682
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:23,321
You were there for ten minutes.
Plenty of time for a kiss and a cuddle.

683
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:30,249
I dreamed last night
that I could hear singing.

684
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,835
And then I realized it wasn't a dream.

685
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:37,503
There was a male voice choir
serenading Marilyn under our window.

686
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,796
At two in the morning.

687
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,511
It's a circus. Freak show.

688
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,097
I'm going back to New York
for a few days.

689
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,351
I need a break.
I need to see my kids.

690
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,062
- That won't help Marilyn.
- I can't help her.

691
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,905
She wants me to protect her,
but... I can't.

692
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,363
She thought I could smash
all her insecurities.

693
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,197
That I can make her a new person.

694
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,033
She read some notes I made.

695
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,290
They were nothing.
Just... Just a few ideas.

696
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,954
- But about her?
- She took them the wrong way.

697
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:18,043
You do... Iove her,
your new bride and all that?

698
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,212
I can't work.

699
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,010
I can't think.

700
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,638
She's devouring me.

701
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,025
Good morning, Vivien.

702
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,277
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
my darling wife.

703
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,110
Hello. I hope Larry isn't
making you all work too hard.

704
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:44,118
I know what a dreadful
slave-driver he could be.

705
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,904
David. He would be lost without you.

706
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,574
- Just doing my job.
- And Jack, of course. Jack.

707
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,334
Oh. I'm getting old, Jack.

708
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,291
More beautiful every year, Vivien.

709
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,628
Well, I need you to work
your miracles on me.

710
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,838
Are you looking after Larry
like I told you?

711
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,422
I'm doing my best, Vivien.

712
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,055
Marilyn, darling.

713
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:10,937
Larry tells me
that you are quite superb,

714
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:14,474
- and I am wild with jealousy.
- Oh.

715
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,735
But everyone says you were
a wonderful Elsie on stage.

716
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,487
Oh, but I'm too old
to play her in the film.

717
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,570
Larry was quite brutal about that.

718
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,362
You see, the truth
is all that matters to him,

719
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,532
and that's why we all
admire him so very much.

720
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:34,202
I must let you work.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.

721
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,506
- Hi, Vivien.
- Goodbye, and you.

722
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,545
I love the mustache. I do.

723
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,088
It suits you. Bye...

724
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,893
So I wasn't addressed.
Who cares?

725
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,347
Bull in the labyrinth. Oop!

726
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,608
Who the heck is Theseus anyway?

727
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,235
I didn't think she
would be so beautiful.

728
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,864
- Disgraceful!
- Oh, she shines on that screen.

729
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,401
Oh, darling.
Puss, don't upset yourself.

730
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,865
You are ten times
the actress she will ever be.

731
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,874
Oh, if you could see yourself.
The way you watch her!

732
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,831
Oh, Vivien, you're imagining things.
Please.

733
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,961
I hope she makes your life hell.

734
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,465
Vivien...

735
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,387
Do you have a cigarette,
please, Colin?

736
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,437
No, not one of my awful things.

737
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,193
Remember, boy,
when it comes to women,

738
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:51,738
you're never too old for humiliation.

739
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,992
Marilyn won't shoot today.
She's gone back to Parkside.

740
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,627
She's upset about
Arthur leaving England.

741
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,504
He's only going to visit his children.

742
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:04,293
You don't leave Marilyn alone.
She can't handle it.

743
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,631
She thinks that everyone's
going to abandon her.

744
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,673
Let's hope she's
changed her bloody mind.

745
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,682
- Yes.
- Sir Laurence?

746
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:17,017
- Roger, what's up?
- Is, uh, Colin there, sir?

747
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,024
- Yes, he is.
- Can I speak to him?

748
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,480
Colin, it's for you.

749
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,113
- Roger?
- Colin.

750
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,448
Miss Monroe.

751
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,157
Why don't you drop by here
on your way home.

752
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,034
- Uh...
- What?

753
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,794
What is Marilyn doing on the phone
with my third fucking assistant?

754
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,331
Yes, I'm sure I could do that.

755
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,124
Good.

756
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,840
Don't tell anyone, though.

757
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,723
Well, is she coming back?

758
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,224
No, she wants to see me.

759
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,351
He shouldn't be talking to her.
He's just a kid.

760
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,514
- Supposing he said something.
- I'm sure Colin knows what he's doing.

761
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,353
Don't you, Colin?

762
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,854
I know you're awfully busy, Colin,

763
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:09,740
but if you could manage to find
me a cup of tea before you leave,

764
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,741
that would be marvelous.

765
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,662
Miss Monroe said
for you to wait.

766
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,246
Help yourself to a drink.

767
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,791
Oh, I'm sorry. I was checking
that you've got everything.

768
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,880
Let me.

769
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,432
Are you frightened of me, Colin?

770
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:39,846
No.

771
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,441
Good. 'Cause I like you.

772
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,109
I want you to help me.

773
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,695
Well, I'm only the third.
I'm just... I'm a messenger, really.

774
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,780
But you know everything
that's going on.

775
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,445
You can see both sides of the situation.

776
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,115
Please tell me everything.

777
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:04,162
- Uh...
- Relax.

778
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,082
I thought you weren't scared of me.

779
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,256
- Are you hungry?
- Uh...

780
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,762
I'll have them send in a tray.
I'm starved.

781
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,263
Oh, go... Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

782
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,143
Am I interrupting something?

783
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,305
Maybe you have a Mrs. Colin
waiting for you at home.

784
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,145
There's no Mrs. Colin.

785
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,356
So we can talk as long as we like.

786
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,656
Why is Sir Olivier so mean?

787
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,826
He talks awful to me.

788
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,612
Like he's slumming.

789
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,699
I'll tell you what's wrong.

790
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,789
It's agony for him
because he is a great actor

791
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,797
that wants to be a film star.
And it's agony for you

792
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:50,925
because you're a film star who
wants to be a great actress.

793
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,383
And this film won't help either of you.

794
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,682
You sure you can handle that?

795
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,435
You don't look old enough to drink.

796
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:05,018
- I'm 23, Miss Monroe.
- Oh, it's Marilyn.

797
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,021
Hmm. I'm 30.

798
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,440
I guess that makes me
an old lady to you.

799
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,696
Seven years is nothing.

800
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,529
You know I've been
married three times already.

801
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,489
How did that happen?

802
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,278
Maybe you're just
looking for the right man.

803
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:23,120
They always look right at the start.

804
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,462
I'll get that.

805
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,545
- Hello?
- Colin, is everything OK?

806
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,881
Everything's fine.
Uh, Miss Monroe, she just...

807
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,296
She had some large packages
she needed handling.

808
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,716
OK, what does she want?

809
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,179
Colin?

810
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,765
- Let me speak to her, Colin.
- Oh...

811
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,100
Let me talk to her. Sh!

812
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,271
Let me speak to her.

813
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,686
What is going on, Colin?

814
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:55,231
I'm afraid she's tied up right now.

815
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,524
Let me talk to her, damn it.

816
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,408
Let me talk to her.

817
00:49:58,579 --> 00:49:59,819
- Colin!
- I'm sorry, Milton.

818
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:03,034
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Colin!

819
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,206
Let's go for a walk in the garden.

820
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,672
Let's go see if we can find any more
reporters in the bushes.

821
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:24,970
Oh, I didn't know
it was so pretty out here.

822
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,854
You should get out more.
You should see the sights.

823
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,607
I am the sights.

824
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,646
You know, we're just like
Elsie and the young king.

825
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:43,033
What would Sir Laurence say
if he could see us now?

826
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,539
I don't think he'd mind.

827
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,876
But he thinks that I'm the enemy.

828
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,958
No, he doesn't understand
your kind of actor.

829
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,215
He's hated the Method ever since
Vivien worked with Elia Kazan.

830
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,251
It's all too strange and new.

831
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,136
So you're the future,
and that frightens him.

832
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,640
You know what?
Every time I walk into the studio,

833
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:07,724
I feel a sense of doom come over me.

834
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:13,606
He gives me the dirtiest looks,
even when he's smiling.

835
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,145
And the crew hates me.

836
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,438
No, that's not true.

837
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,108
The only person I can trust is Paula.

838
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,027
Except for you now, maybe.

839
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,743
Phone call from New York,
Miss Monroe. It's Mr. Miller.

840
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:35,290
- Goodbye, Colin.
- Goodbye.

841
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,708
Thank you for telling me the truth.

842
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,010
You'll be leaving now, I expect.

843
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,513
I don't care if he fucks her sideways.

844
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,770
Perhaps it'll calm her down.

845
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,101
Oh, hello, boy.

846
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,437
Hear you spent
last night with Marilyn.

847
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,523
I didn't spend the night with her.
We just... We had a chat.

848
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,313
- I heard them chuckling.
- Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic,

849
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,356
Marilyn's more likely to behave herself.

850
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,196
- She just wants a chum, that's all.
- A chum?

851
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,157
Jesus Christ, what is this,
Goodbye, Mr. Chips?

852
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,913
Grow up, kid.

853
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:17,039
You know, I thought working with Marilyn
would make me feel young again.

854
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,715
But I look dead in the rushes.

855
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,471
Dead behind these eyes.

856
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,807
I wanted to renew myself through her.

857
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:35,604
But all I see reflected
in that magnificent face

858
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,611
is my own inadequacy.

859
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,902
You know, I admire Marilyn.
I really do, despite her behavior.

860
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,618
She's taken everything
Hollywood can throw at her

861
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,749
and she's triumphed.
That takes some bloody guts.

862
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,254
An actress has to be pretty tough

863
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,882
to get even a tenth as far as she has.

864
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,048
Be careful, boy.

865
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,890
She doesn't need to be rescued.

866
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,925
Not really.

867
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,815
It's you.

868
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,159
Marvelous!
Absolutely marvelous, darling.

869
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,195
That's wonderful. Well done.
Let's check that.

870
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:29,429
Three minutes, ladies
and gentlemen. Three minutes!

871
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,468
Colin! Arthur Miller called me.
He's not happy with you.

872
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,478
- He doesn't even know who I am.
- Marilyn must have said something.

873
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,764
Well, maybe she's trying
to make him jealous.

874
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,738
Listen, kid. I've known
Marilyn for seven years.

875
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,445
I fell in love with her
just as you've done.

876
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,860
We had ten days together,
and that was it.

877
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:53,871
She picked me up, she put me
down, that's what she does.

878
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,282
She breaks hearts.
She will break yours.

879
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,078
My advice to you is quit
before you get burned.

880
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:04,214
- I don't need your advice.
- Have it your way.

881
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,375
You don't see Marilyn again.
You don't even talk to her.

882
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,966
She's completely off limits to you.
Do you understand me?

883
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,256
Yes.

884
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,344
- I waited for you on Friday.
- Lucy, I'm so sorry.

885
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,229
I completely forgot.
I just... I've been so busy.

886
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,310
So I hear.

887
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,646
Well, you know how crews gossip.
There's nothing in it.

888
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:26,233
Of course there isn't.

889
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,863
Marilyn Monroe fancying you?
Come on.

890
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:34,487
- Oh, hi, Colin.
- Hi.

891
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,121
Hi, Lucy.

892
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:47,379
- I thought you were different.
- I really like you, and we have fun.

893
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,386
And now it's time to set
your sights a little higher.

894
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,973
Well, good luck.

895
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,283
- Get in.
- Any problem, Roger?

896
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,294
Uh, no. Just dropped by
to take Colin out to lunch.

897
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,420
You're not taking him to Marilyn.

898
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,753
That would drop us all
in a whole ocean of shit.

899
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,839
No, sir. Been looking forward
to this, haven't we, Colin?

900
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,470
Yeah.

901
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,470
OK. You have a nice time, boys.

902
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:43,688
- Surprise!
- Jesus!

903
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,100
Roger and I decided
to take you on an adventure.

904
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,312
What the hell?

905
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,730
- Colin!
- Oh!

906
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,492
Get back here, you little bastard!

907
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,904
Colin! You're fired! You hear me?

908
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,579
Do you think he saw me?

909
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:04,994
Colin!

910
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,707
Snuggle up. This is fun.

911
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,259
This is the getaway car.

912
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,059
I oughta feel like this every day.

913
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,027
We have today, anyway.

914
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:37,193
We have one day to do
whatever you like.

915
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,861
Then we can go back
to real life tomorrow.

916
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,655
Only one day?

917
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,791
- Well, maybe the weekend.
- Or a week!

918
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,414
What should we do now?

919
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,958
We could go to Windsor Castle,
if you like.

920
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,055
Detective Chief
Superintendent Smith.

921
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,267
I'm escorting this lady
and gentleman for the day.

922
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,726
They'd like to look around the castle.

923
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,892
I need a contact name for the book.

924
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,732
You don't know Her Majesty,
by any chance?

925
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,069
Yes, we met at a movie premiere.
She said my dress was pretty.

926
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,733
I don't think that quite does it, sir.

927
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,697
My godfather works here.

928
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,658
He's the royal librarian.
Sir Owen Morshead.

929
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:46,808
- Hello, sir.
- Colin, my boy! Come in!

930
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:50,065
Forgive the dust.

931
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:53,272
Oh, you are very pretty, my dear.

932
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,778
Oh!

933
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,401
Gee, I'd sure like
to read all these books.

934
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:00,409
Luckily, one doesn't really have to.

935
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,615
A lot of them just have
pictures in.

936
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:07,783
- This is by an artist called Holbein.
- She's beautiful.

937
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,670
She was the daughter
of one of the king's courtiers.

938
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,705
Nearly 400 years ago.

939
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,671
Gee, I hope I look that good
when I'm 400.

940
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,514
These are by Leonardo da Vinci.

941
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,221
Didn't he paint that lady
with the funny smile?

942
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,262
- The Mona Lisa.
- Do you have that one here, too?

943
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,931
Alas, that one got away.

944
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,770
Oh.

945
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,652
- The Queen's sorry to have missed you.
- Really?

946
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,564
Oh, yes! Why, she was only
saying to me the other day,

947
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:43,327
"What must it be like to be
the most famous woman on Earth?"

948
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,046
Colin, look.

949
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,799
Gee, I sure never had a doll's house
like this when I was a kid.

950
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:04,260
- Can I?
- Yes, of course.

951
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,269
This is me.

952
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:17,356
That's you, and these are our kids.

953
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,615
Oh, our daughter's so pretty.

954
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:28,534
All little girls should be
told how pretty they are.

955
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:34,453
Should grow up knowing how
much their mother loves them.

956
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,049
There she is!

957
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,807
Shall I be her?

958
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:58,857
- Are you somebody, mate?
- No. I'm no one.

959
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,328
So this
is your old school, huh?

960
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,497
Did you sing in the school choir?

961
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,384
- No.
- That's a lie, I can tell.

962
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,341
How old were you?

963
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,676
I was sent away to boarding
school when I was eight.

964
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,059
Why? Didn't your parents
like you very much?

965
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:34,221
That's just how they do it in my family.

966
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,515
Well, I'd never send my kids away.

967
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,730
Eton is 500 years old.

968
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:42,021
It was founded by King Henry Vl.

969
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,939
No wonder it's so dusty.

970
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,575
Looks more like a palace.

971
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,532
That room there,
upper school, that's where you're sent

972
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,742
if you don't work hard enough.
You're whipped.

973
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,202
- No.
- Mm-hm.

974
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,833
- That's awful.
- It's Marilyn Monroe!

975
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,088
Oh!

976
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,417
Look who it is!

977
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,635
- Come see Marilyn.
- Well, hello, boys.

978
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,220
- Pleased to meet you!
- Blow us a kiss, Marilyn!

979
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:15,933
Sure. All right, boys. Work hard!
I don't want anyone whipping you.

980
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,223
You can whip me anytime, Marilyn!

981
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,186
Oh!

982
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,356
Oh!

983
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,772
- Maybe we should go.
- It's time to go. Lovely to see you.

984
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:38,623
Hurry up, slowpoke!

985
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:44,795
There's no...
We haven't got our... We can't...

986
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,712
Oh, God.

987
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,805
Oh, God.

988
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,399
This is great.

989
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,819
Oh, my God!

990
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:11,235
What if a boat goes past?
We'll be arrested.

991
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:14,325
Don't worry. Roger will fix it.

992
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,286
- Ooh!
- What?

993
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,002
- I have something in my eye.
- Let me see.

994
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,585
I can't see anything.

995
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:38,311
That's the first time
I've kissed anyone younger than me.

996
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:43,191
There's a lot
of older guys in Hollywood.

997
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:48,112
Ooh.

998
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:05,334
Don't be shy, Colin.
It's nothing you haven't seen before.

999
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:17,142
Oh, Colin. And you, an old Etonian.

1000
01:04:17,312 --> 01:04:19,928
My God, it's cold. It's freezing!

1001
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:31,315
Here. Come here. Let me warm you up.

1002
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,451
Is that better?

1003
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,750
I want this to be the perfect date.

1004
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,504
I haven't had a real date
since I was 13 years old.

1005
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,601
That was nice.

1006
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:11,029
Ahem! Time to go home,
I think, Miss Monroe.

1007
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,336
Be careful not
to get in too deep, son.

1008
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,727
Hi, Milton.

1009
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:37,028
The next time I come on set,
you better make sure Colin is there.

1010
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,408
Take him home.

1011
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,873
You spent the day with her.
What frame of mind was she in?

1012
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,666
- She was fine, sir.
- Oh, how lovely.

1013
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,835
Well, go and find out why
she's not standing here

1014
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,425
right now in front of that.
There's a good chap.

1015
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,590
And perhaps on this splendid
day we can persuade her

1016
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:05,056
to do some of the work that she is
currently paying herself to do.

1017
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:09,681
- Don't start, Dickie.
- You won't get any sympathy from me.

1018
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,521
- She's trying her best.
- Oh, dear.

1019
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,811
Little Colin's in love.

1020
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:22,615
- Colin?
- What's the matter?

1021
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:25,246
It's Marilyn.
She's asking for you.

1022
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,081
She hasn't made a sound
for over an hour.

1023
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,922
- So how many pills did she take?
- Jesus! Who knows.

1024
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,929
- I wasn't counting.
- Marilyn? So how about the window?

1025
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,766
Marilyn, darling?
Open the door, bubbeleh.

1026
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,100
That's her window.

1027
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,531
Marilyn?

1028
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,447
Marilyn.

1029
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,660
Colin?

1030
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,371
Oh, hi, Colin.

1031
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,914
Are you OK?

1032
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,798
Everyone's worried about you.

1033
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,637
Oh, phooey.

1034
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,173
Colin!

1035
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,266
- Get in.
- Colin!

1036
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,523
Colin, come on, open up!

1037
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,103
- Colin?
- Colin!

1038
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,519
Open this door.
She needs me. Colin!

1039
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,688
You don't understand her.

1040
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:40,901
- Come on.
- She's fine, uh...

1041
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:43,316
- Come on, open up!
- I'm gonna keep an eye on her,

1042
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:44,529
and I will sleep on the sofa.

1043
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:47,537
Colin, listen to me.
You can't talk to her.

1044
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,618
I can't find the key.
Look, you can all go home now.

1045
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:53,205
- You don't understand her. Come on.
- Go home.

1046
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,995
Oh, my...

1047
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,939
Colin. What are you doing here?

1048
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,609
Uh, I came in through the window.

1049
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:05,944
Milton thought that you were sick.

1050
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,284
Oh.

1051
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,030
The window.

1052
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,039
How romantic.

1053
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,292
That's just like Romeo and Juliet.

1054
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:22,048
What... Why would
they say that I'm sick?

1055
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,133
Please.

1056
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,595
Please don't take any more.

1057
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:36,387
Who's this? Who's that?

1058
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:40,479
That's my mama.
She bought me a white piano.

1059
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,067
Right before they
took her to the asylum.

1060
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,823
I grew up in other
people's homes, mostly.

1061
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,153
Is that Abraham Lincoln?

1062
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:54,492
That's my dad.

1063
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:59,001
Well, I don't know who my real father
is, so it may as well be him, right?

1064
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:07,840
Do you have a home, Colin?
A real one?

1065
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:12,515
- With a mama and a daddy?
- Yes, I do.

1066
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,721
Do they love you?

1067
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,561
I'm sure that they do.

1068
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:21,941
Mm. You're lucky.

1069
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,526
Yes.

1070
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,155
Do you love me, Colin?

1071
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,742
Yes.

1072
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:38,033
You're like some Greek goddess to me.

1073
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,042
I'm not a goddess.

1074
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,372
I just wanna be loved
like a regular girl.

1075
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,213
- Mr. Miller loves you.
- No, I found his notebook.

1076
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,595
He said the most
horrible things about me.

1077
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:54,599
Writers, they scribble all kinds
of things. It doesn't mean anything.

1078
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,725
No, he wanted me to find it.

1079
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:01,481
He said he wished
he'd never married me.

1080
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:06,194
Why do the people
I love always leave me?

1081
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:09,026
I will never leave you.

1082
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,990
All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe.

1083
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:25,126
As soon as they realize
I'm not her, they run.

1084
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,385
You're different.

1085
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:34,964
You're not like that.

1086
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:43,352
You should date that wardrobe girl.

1087
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,858
She's so pretty.

1088
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,605
I don't want to.

1089
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,489
I love you.

1090
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,572
This is nice.

1091
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,657
It's like spoons.

1092
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:43,078
I used to do this with Johnny.

1093
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,244
- Who's Johnny?
- Johnny Hyde.

1094
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:52,000
He was my agent back in the old days.

1095
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,923
He was thin just like you.

1096
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:05,013
Marilyn, do one thing for me.

1097
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,647
Mm...

1098
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:10,025
Come to the studio on-time tomorrow

1099
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,232
and show everybody what you can do.

1100
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,773
Show Larry that you are a great actress.

1101
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:19,823
OK.

- This is intolerable!
- With deepest respects, sir.

1110
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:27,720
My message was so important,
I had no choice but to intrude.

1111
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:29,434
- Revolution?
- No, sir.

1112
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,519
Miss Marina's aunt has
been in a motor accident.

1113
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,859
What?

1114
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:37,147
Oh, go away, you silly man.

1115
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:40,908
Miss Marina, your aunt. Do you realize
how serious her condition is?

1116
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:44,821
Well, it's her own fault.

1117
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:48,116
She has no right out
this time of night. She's 93!

1118
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:51,957
Cut it there.

1119
01:15:57,303 --> 01:16:00,170
Well, whatever it was you did
to her, boy, keep doing it.

1120
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:05,683
I've never seen her so happy.

1121
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:07,434
- Yes.
- We need Colin

1122
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,015
at the house right away.

1123
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,146
Got a pain in my side,
for Christ's sake.

1124
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:13,979
What are they trying to make me
think I'm crazy or something?

1125
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:18,066
Is that what it is? You know I don't
just rev it up like a Model T.

1126
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,322
I don't just crank it up.

1127
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,360
No one's asking you to just crank it up.
We're worried about you...

1128
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:25,778
Isn't that what you're saying?
I was sick, for God's sake!

1129
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,447
- Can I be sick?
- Colin's here.

1130
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:29,741
Colin.

1131
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,285
Colin.

1132
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:36,456
Colin thinks I'm a good actress.
Don't you, Colin?

1133
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,750
- Yes I do. You were wonderful today.
- See?

1134
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:42,420
- Marilyn's tired now.
- I want him to stay with me.

1135
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,304
And what would Arthur say
if he knew Colin was here?

1136
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:46,761
You heard what she said,
she wants me here. Come on.

1137
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:52,351
You have no idea of your
position in the world, Marilyn.

1138
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:58,524
You are the greatest actress
that has ever been.

1139
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,279
Mm?

1140
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,862
I love you like a daughter.

1141
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:08,700
- Oh.
- My darling girl. I know it's hard now.

1142
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:13,038
But you will survive this and go on
to better things. You're young.

1143
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:17,538
Your life is ahead of you,
just beginning.

1144
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,875
Sit with Colin, mm?

1145
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:24,712
Oh, Paula, I'm sorry.

1146
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,381
- Come here.
- Oh, no.

1147
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,643
Come here. I'm here now.

1148
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,021
Colin?

1149
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:37,149
- I'll look after you.
- Don't leave.

1150
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,684
- I'm not.
- Please don't leave.

1151
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:41,696
- I'm not. Sh.
- Please don't leave.

1152
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:43,731
Please don't leave.

1153
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,285
Oh.

1154
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:06,678
Oh, it hurts, it hurts!

1155
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:11,600
It's a baby! It's a baby!

1156
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,261
I can't lose the baby! Colin!

1157
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,681
Oh!

1158
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,724
Roger! Call a doctor!

1159
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,066
Who's in charge here?

1160
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:31,157
I've given Mrs. Miller an injection
and the bleeding stopped.

1161
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:34,870
But she needs to stay in bed tomorrow,
and after that she'll be fine.

1162
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,701
I suggest someone stays with her.

1163
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,120
She'll be safe with me. Thank you.

1164
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,386
- Thank you.
- Good night, then.

1165
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,806
Was she really pregnant, sir?

1166
01:18:57,233 --> 01:19:00,396
I think that's a private matter
between Mr. and Mrs. Miller, don't you?

1167
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:24,047
Arthur's on his way back.

1168
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,555
When this movie is over,

1169
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:38,266
I'm gonna settle down
and be a good wife to him.

1170
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:44,902
I'm gonna learn to make matzo-ball soup
as good as his dad.

1171
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,987
We have to forget this
whole thing ever happened.

1172
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:57,785
I don't want to forget.

1173
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,371
Let me protect you from all this.

1174
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:07,667
Oh. What are you gonna do?

1175
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,881
- Marry me?
- Why not?

1176
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,546
You could quit this.
Forget Marilyn Monroe.

1177
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:14,465
Forget Hollywood. Let it all go.

1178
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,469
Just let it go.

1179
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,026
I couldn't just give it up.

1180
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,487
Why not?

1181
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,905
Why not, when it drives you crazy?

1182
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,035
You think I'm crazy?

1183
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:39,073
I just meant that you could be happy.

1184
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,833
I am happy.

1185
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,083
Of course you're happy.

1186
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:56,097
You're the biggest star in the world.

1187
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,071
You're right.
We have to forget all this.

1188
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:16,569
So from now on, I'm just
the third assistant director,

1189
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:19,284
and we will never look
at each other again.

1190
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:24,289
Maybe just a wink.

1191
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,502
Once in a while.

1192
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:47,308
My dear. My dear.

1193
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:50,444
- Yes?
- They're ready for you on set.

1194
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,354
- Marilyn?
- Just arrived.

1195
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,024
Only an hour late.
Not bad by her standards.

1196
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,819
Perhaps we'll finish this
bloody film after all.

1197
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:01,868
Five-two-seven. T ake one.

1198
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,373
- Cut it there.
- And check that, please.

1199
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:09,913
Five-eight-four, take two.

1200
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:14,634
T ake five.

1201
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:16,883
Six-four-nine, take two.

1202
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,007
Let's cut it there.

1203
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,174

01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,691
Cut. That's a wrap.

1216
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:27,787
She's there.

1217
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,928
I hope you will all forgive me.

1218
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:52,141
It wasn't altogether my fault,

1219
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,229
but I've been ill.

1220
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,574
I'd like you to remember I tried.

1221
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:41,948
Lucy, um...

1222
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:46,495
I was wondering if you were
doing anything on Saturday.

1223
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:49,827
I'm washing my hair.

1224
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:55,875
Did she break your heart?

1225
01:24:58,594 --> 01:24:59,709
A little.

1226
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,010
Good. It needed breaking.

1227
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,395
We're back, everyone!

1228
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:17,730
All right...

1229
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:43,344
You do look, my son, in a moved
sort, as if you were dismayed.

1230
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:45,674
Be cheerful, sir.

1231
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,513
Our revels now are ended.

1232
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:56,140
We are such stuff

1233
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,185
as dreams are made on,

1234
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:03,231
and our little life

1235
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:07,697
is rounded with a sleep.

1236
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,577
Prospero.

1237
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,201
She's quite wonderful.

1238
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:19,834
No training, no craft to speak of.

1239
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,545
No guile, just pure instinct.
She's astonishing.

1240
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,382
- You should tell her that.
- Oh, I will. But she won't believe me.

1241
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:28,922
President Taft.

1242
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,217
It's probably
what makes her great.

1243
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:35,512
It's almost certainly what
makes her so profoundly unhappy.

1244
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:39,400
Oh, Miss Marina,
won't you have some champagne?

1245
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:42,936
Oh, I don't know, Your Grand Ducal.
You really think I ought?

1246
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:45,606
I tried my best to change her,

1247
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:48,901
but she remains brilliant, despite me.

1248
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:54,244
Maybe just up to... Ah!

1249
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:56,954
Do you know, I think directing a movie

1250
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:59,541
has to be just about
the best job ever invented.

1251
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,710
But Marilyn's cured me
of ever wanting to do it again.

1252
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,341
Well, now I'm back to the theater.

1253
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,252
John Osborne's writing a piece for me.

1254
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:10,673
Sir, I thought you hated
all that Royal Court stuff.

1255
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,809
Well, Miller made me see
things a little differently.

1256
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,138
Thank you, Colin, for all your help.

1257
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:28,698
Glad you ran away to the circus?

1258
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,788
My dear.

1259
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,420
Uh... ow.

1260
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:46,083
I've got a solemn word
of warning for you.

1261
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,842
What is that, my beloved?

1262
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:51,217
You know what's going to happen.

1263
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,425
I'm going to fall in love with you.

1264
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,771
I'm going to fall in love with you

1265
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,058
because I always, always do.

1266
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,547
There you go.

1267
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,940
Buy a girl a drink?

1268
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:49,688
I'll get another one
of those, please, Barry.

1269
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,743
I wasn't going to leave
without saying goodbye.

1270
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:59,080
Don't forget me.

1271
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:03,539
As if I could.

1272
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:06,580
Everybody else on the picture
wishes they could.

1273
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,669
They don't understand you.

1274
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:13,878
Walk me to my car?

1275
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,675
Nice place you got here.

1276
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,129
Thanks for being on my side.

1277
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:04,972
Looking a couple of inches taller
than when I first saw you.

1278
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:15,236
her embrace.

1279
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,200
Her belief in me.

1280
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:21,738
And the joy she gave.
That was her gift.

1281
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:26,953
When I think of her now, I think
of that time when a dream came true.

1282
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:31,374
And my only talent
was not to close my eyes.
