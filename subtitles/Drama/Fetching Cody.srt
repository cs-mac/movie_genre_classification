{673}{791}SEATTLE
{1677}{1702}- Morning.|- Morning.
{1708}{1795}Hey, Dad, we have to discuss|my allowance. I need a raise.
{1801}{1863}Buying a girl gummi bears|won't close the deal.
{1869}{1914}- Like you'd know.|- Alex.
{1920}{2017}But, Mom, Cody's almost 16|and I've had twice as many dates as him.
{2023}{2124}- Sitting in a tree house isn't a date.|- It is when you're playing doctor.
{2130}{2220}Bye.
{2298}{2406}You smell good. Did you shave?
{2424}{2478}- Do your chores.|- I'll do them later.
{2484}{2563}Those poor guinea pigs have been|sitting in excrement for days.
{2569}{2692}Alex, you play with them more than I do.|Let's trade. I'll mow the lawn three times.
{2698}{2806}No way. Just cos I'm ten doesn't mean I'm|an idiot. I know what "excrement" means.
{2812}{2919}Alex! We're eating here.
{3184}{3284}Sweetie, Mommy will be right back.
{4288}{4322}Stop! My baby!
{4328}{4415}My baby's in that car!|Somebody stop that car!
{4421}{4520}Oh, my God! Stop the car!
{5507}{5596}Unlock the door!
{7066}{7199}Next time, please stick with a tricycle.
{7543}{7648}Sweetie, it's OK.
{7677}{7794}- What happened?|- Some kid stopped it.
{8125}{8175}HONG KONG
{8181}{8305}Dr Connors, we've given you|a great deal of money. We expect results.
{8311}{8357}ERIS HEADQUARTERS
{8363}{8505}If you gentlemen would|step this way, please. Gather round.
{8526}{8629}Imagine we're somewhere in Alaska|and a huge oil tanker runs aground.
{8635}{8758}What do we get? An oil spill,|one of the most serious threats to nature.
{8764}{8849}A calamity that could take generations|for sea life to recover.
{8855}{8914}But wait. What's this?
{8920}{9053}Look who's coming. The nanobots.
{9221}{9318}Very impressive.
{9325}{9407}Lovely.
{9444}{9557}Baby seals everywhere|will praise your name, Doctor.
{9602}{9654}So, is that real oil, Connors?
{9660}{9837}Oh, yeah. Yes, here's a sample.|You can test it if you want.
{9856}{9909}Can they be programmed|to eat other things?
{9915}{10044}They can be programmed to break down|any silicone or carbon-based compound.
{10050}{10128}- You have ten days.|- What?
{10134}{10208}- That's impossible.|- He said you have ten days.
{10214}{10296}We have our own agenda, Doctor.
{10302}{10384}- That's impossible.|- Goodbye, Dr Connors.
{10390}{10524}- He has no idea what we hope to achieve.|- Let's keep it that way, François.
{10785}{10863}- I told you no ice. Here.|- I'm sorry, sir.
{10869}{11029}You never know how long it's been|in the freezer. It could be filled with crap.
{11035}{11180}This is Dr Albert Connors, the world's|foremost expert in nanotechnology.
{11186}{11275}Microscopic robots.
{11278}{11321}These robots could be programmed
{11327}{11418}to destroy our most vital communication|and military infrastructure.
{11424}{11544}I'm talking missile-guidance systems,|boats, tanks, planes, biological...
{11550}{11611}We get the point. Before we lost contact,
{11617}{11705}Agent Bolivar confirmed that|Connors is working with ERIS.
{11711}{11803}This is probably my last transmission.|I think they're on to me.
{11809}{11900}Don't send any more agents.|Everyone has been compromised.
{11906}{12046}I'm gonna transmit images now. This is|yesterday at the ERIS Covert Conference,
{12052}{12123}where Dr Connors demonstrated|his latest advancements.
{12129}{12208}And this is Dr Brinkman, head of ERIS.
{12214}{12324}And this, François Molay, his henchman.
{12330}{12440}As far as I understand it, they plan to...
{12559}{12714}We need to know what they're planning.|But Connors is very reclusive, secretive.
{12720}{12806}After his wife died two years ago,|Connors dropped out of public view.
{12812}{12948}His only contact with the outside world|is through his daughter Natalie.
{12954}{13043}I want to get close to this girl.
{13049}{13187}McAIlister, brief the staff|on the Agent Development Program.
{13193}{13347}Under the guise of a summer camp for the|brightest and best, we began to recruit.
{13353}{13408}Welcome to the|Agent Development Program.
{13414}{13538}Since 1987, under secrecy, the CIA has|recruited juvenile agents the nation over.
{13544}{13622}As soon as we received word|that a candidate had been spotted,
{13628}{13735}we brought them into our facilities|under the guise of summer camps.
{13741}{13829}And their parents had no idea|of their real activities.
{13835}{13984}There they were trained in defence,|navigation and explosives diffusion.
{13990}{14067}Our juvenile agents|are stationed all over the nation.
{14073}{14155}They meticulously maintain|the façades of normal childhoods
{14161}{14210}as they await their call for duty.
{14216}{14351}Wait. You're telling me|we're training children to become agents?
{14357}{14505}Teenagers! Let's be clear. The clock is|ticking. This may be our last, best chance.
{14511}{14636}- These kids operate alone?|- Of course not. That'd be irresponsible.
{14642}{14743}One of our most impressive agents|lives not far from Natalie Connors.
{14749}{14821}Smart, resourceful,
{14827}{14921}and, according to my reports,
{14927}{15023}he's quite a lady-killer.
{15045}{15094}Do you...
{15100}{15207}Hi, Cody.
{15320}{15404}Are you in special ed?
{15571}{15606}Hi, Cody.
{15612}{15715}So you think, Amy,|that Friday night we...
{15721}{15908}Cody, I need to study.|So why don't you jump off a cliff?
{16434}{16514}- Cody Banks?|- Yeah.
{16520}{16574}You want "him"?
{16580}{16618}She wants Cody.
{16624}{16745}Quiet! Or you'll all be in trouble.
{16776}{16863}- You, come with me.|- Why?
{16869}{16960}I wanna be in trouble.
{17042}{17177}Well, since you're on the business|of taking towels, take mine too.
{17183}{17240}Could you hold this, please? Thank you.
{17246}{17302}I really hate it...
{17308}{17415}when people talk back!
{17484}{17526}Thank you. Let's go.
{17532}{17639}Who are you? What did I do?
{17680}{17827}Mary had a little lamb,|its fleece as white as snow.
{17859}{17925}Peter Piper picked a peck|of pickled peppers?
{17931}{18028}- Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish.|- How many pieces do you wish?
{18034}{18188}This is what happens when you design|a code book in summer camp.
{18246}{18321}So, I'm being called up?|My country needs me?
{18327}{18397}- Yep.|- Where are we going? The Middle East?
{18403}{18447}Russia? China?
{18453}{18556}Downtown Seattle.
{18926}{18987}I'm in. My first mission!
{18993}{19108}- Didn't think it would happen this soon?|- Plus I didn't think my partner would...
{19114}{19199}Let's get one thing straight.|I am not your partner.
{19205}{19257}I'm your handler.
{19263}{19350}Like in the zoo.
{19408}{19512}You will speak only when spoken to.|You will follow orders without question.
{19518}{19630}If you're lucky, you might get to...
{19647}{19758}Hey. How did you get in here?|There's no school tour today.
{19764}{19847}I'm not on a school tour.|Look, I'm an agent.
{19853}{19941}- I probably left my ID in my other clothes.|- Right.
{19947}{20048}- I'm with Ronica Miles.|- You wish.
{20054}{20141}Here he is.
{20168}{20250}Sir, I just apprehended a trespasser.|It was a bit of a struggle.
{20256}{20303}- What's your name?|- Rosychuk.
{20309}{20369}Come here, Rosychuk.
{20375}{20537}You know, you've just apprehended|the most important kid in America!
{20543}{20609}Mr Banks, this way. This way.
{20615}{20668}What was he thinkin'?
{20674}{20826}You got "agent" written all over you.|I mean, it's in the eyes.
{20832}{20913}You got it, kid. Come on.
{20919}{20981}Welcome to the CIA.
{20987}{21114}You like the Sonics? What about|front-row seats for the play-offs?
{21161}{21237}We've prepared a briefing|to explain nanobots to you.
{21243}{21312}I'm familiar with them.|Tiny weapons, giant potential.
{21318}{21413}Micro-devices, built up of compounds|of polymer cobalt and gold,
{21419}{21514}other times constructed with|fullerene complexes called buckysomes -
{21520}{21586}assemblers that can bond|atoms and computer circuits.
{21592}{21664}The most impressive tests|on microsurgery were conducted
{21670}{21787}at Sweden's Linköping University.
{21822}{21877}Well, I guess we can move on, huh?
{21883}{21950}OK, let's turn to Natalie Connors.
{21956}{22047}Natalie Connors, 15 years old.|Hair blonde, eyes brown.
{22053}{22109}Likes horses, preferably Arabians,
{22115}{22236}pistachio ice cream,|turquoise jewellery, and TS Eliot.
{22242}{22330}Learn everything you can about this girl.|Get close to her.
{22336}{22411}That's my mission?|I have to get close to "her"?
{22417}{22483}Yes. Insinuate yourself into her life.
{22489}{22598}It is imperative you find out|what her father and ERIS are planning.
{22604}{22683}And we'll help.|We've placed you in all her classes.
{22689}{22762}All of them? Isn't that a little creepy?
{22768}{22807}Creepy?
{22813}{22945}We're the CIA.|That's what we do. Right?
{22954}{23002}And...
{23008}{23091}you want me to become her boyfriend?
{23097}{23142}Cody, the plan is simple.
{23148}{23230}She has a birthday coming up.|Her father's throwing her a party.
{23236}{23308}The first step is to get yourself|invited to that party.
{23314}{23424}And be careful. This is not|secret agent Little League any more.
{23430}{23530}This is the show, Mr Banks.|And this is showtime.
{23536}{23669}Now, if you can't handle it,|you just tell me now.
{23689}{23793}You can count on me.
{23836}{23918}Oh, yes.
{23937}{24069}Attention. Rocket launch test.
{24137}{24190}Don't touch anything.
{24196}{24273}Five, four, three,
{24279}{24366}two, one.
{24519}{24621}Mr Banks. Come see me, son.
{24639}{24761}I've prepared a number of dope items|which I think you're gonna be down with.
{24767}{24955}This item here is equipped with a virtual|telephoto lens and low penetration x-ray.
{24969}{25028}Gimme that!
{25034}{25148}This is your cellphone. It's|a state-of-the-art mobile command centre
{25154}{25274}with a holographic audiovisual display|and a personal GPS transceiver.
{25280}{25329}OK.
{25335}{25483}Now, this is a CIA get-outta-trouble watch.|See this silver button?
{25489}{25636}Be very careful with this little silver|button, cos it'll just make people go...
{25646}{25694}What was that?
{25700}{25778}One more time. I didn't get it.
{25808}{25907}I don't even want to know.
{25959}{26027}All right, let's wrap this up.
{26033}{26083}$5,000 cash.
{26089}{26150}What for?
{26156}{26247}I think they buy things with it,|I believe.
{26253}{26334}OK. That's it. Thanks for comin'.
{26340}{26449}- Wait. I think we're forgetting something.|- Oh, no. I'm not forgettin' anything.
{26455}{26575}- What about those wheels?|- No, Cody, you don't need to drive.
{26581}{26689}- I need to impress the girls.|- OK. Well, then we got you fixed up.
{26695}{26817}Look at this. Hm?|This thing is really full of surprises.
{26823}{26896}- Fine.|- I think you're gonna impress the girls.
{26902}{26929}Oh, yeah.
{26935}{27030}- Good luck.|- Thanks!
{27036}{27100}- You're transferring to a prep school?|- Yep.
{27106}{27165}I got a scholarship|to Donovan Prep Academy.
{27171}{27228}A scholarship? Hold on.
{27234}{27308}When did you apply?|Did I sign something?
{27314}{27396}Yeah. A few months ago.|It's always been my dream to go there.
{27402}{27471}It has? But what about your friends?
{27477}{27546}- I'll make new ones.|- With all those spoiled brats?
{27552}{27617}And why would they want "you"?
{27623}{27734}Diversity. At least five per cent|of the students have to be normal.
{27740}{27838}I don't know about this. In fact,|I wanna make something very clear.
{27844}{27975}I am not agreeing to anything|until I meet a school administrator.
{28038}{28098}- Mr Banks?|- Yes.
{28104}{28186}I'm from the William Donovan|Preparatory Academy.
{28192}{28279}I'm an administrator from the school.
{28313}{28412}"Agent"... Banks.
{28425}{28527}I heard you really "closed the deal" with|Amy. Maybe you should try gummi bears.
{28533}{28598}- How do you know about that?|- Everybody knows.
{28604}{28671}- She thinks I'm a loser.|- Duh.
{28677}{28764}Amy, I...
{28838}{28947}Cody is a wonderful student with|extraordinary math and science abilities.
{28953}{29033}- And what is it exactly that you do?|- Dean of admissions.
{29039}{29141}Donovan Academy feels he isn't being|challenged in his current environment.
{29147}{29201}Do you have some paperwork|we might see?
{29207}{29294}Of course.
{29455}{29528}Wow.
{29668}{29715}- Nervous?|- Nope.
{29721}{29803}Got your schedule?
{29813}{29949}"Honours English. Trig. Chemistry."|Hey, I don't think I need all of this.
{29955}{30063}- Can't I just meet her between classes?|- You will attend every class as instructed.
{30069}{30116}You might even learn something.
{30122}{30187}This isn't what I had in mind|when I joined the CIA.
{30193}{30266}Join the club. I didn't think|I'd be chaperoning teenagers.
{30272}{30386}You know, maybe you should try decaf.
{30466}{30620}It's my job to make sure you do your job.|If you screw up, I take the heat.
{30626}{30684}So, I guess she grows on you.
{30690}{30735}Right?
{30741}{30780}Nope.
{30786}{30855}Admission papers. Hat.
{30861}{30895}Hat? What hat?
{30901}{30972}Seattle Seahawks.|They're her favourite football team.
{30978}{31128}You know, it's an icebreaker.|A conversation starter.
{31134}{31256}Look. That guy has a bird on his head.
{31264}{31330}- Guys!|- No, it looks good.
{31336}{31386}I'm not wearing this. I look like an idiot.
{31392}{31571}Guys, it's two minutes till first period.|You don't want to be tardy.
{31616}{31734}- What if she doesn't like me?|- What's not to like?
{32671}{32753}Sorry.
{32807}{32894}Hi, Natalie.
{33077}{33164}Target acquired.
{33225}{33326}New kid. You're the scholarship case|from the other side of town, right?
{33332}{33400}Pleased to meet you.|My name's Cody. Banks.
{33406}{33531}Banks? Hey, we got somethin'|in common, Cody. My dad "owns" banks.
{33537}{33574}Very funny. I gotta go.
{33580}{33638}Not so fast.
{33644}{33709}Check it out.
{33715}{33868}- Come on, give it back.|- What are you gonna do about it?
{34164}{34276}If you're gonna keep my watch, promise|me you won't touch that silver button.
{34282}{34341}- That silver button?|- Yeah, don't touch it.
{34347}{34437}I won't touch the silver but...
{34560}{34657}Told ya not to touch it.
{34966}{35049}- Are those books?|- Yeah.
{35055}{35152}I love books.|I could read all day. Love 'em.
{35158}{35254}Great. Then you're in the right place.
{35260}{35349}I especially love TS Eliot.
{35355}{35406}- You do?|- I think she's amazing.
{35412}{35537}You know, the way she captures the|female perspective. It's just so female-like.
{35543}{35591}It's great.
{35597}{35658}TS Eliot is a man.
{35664}{35760}If you want to get all technical, of course.|But you never know these days.
{35766}{35849}Do you by any chance|happen to be in special ed?
{35855}{35892}I love horses.
{35898}{36011}I think their hair thing is really cool.
{36017}{36104}What a freak.
{36285}{36338}Natalie Connors.
{36344}{36446}Way out of your league.
{36506}{36577}Driver's ed.
{36583}{36638}Oh, my God, it was so cute.|Are you gonna go?
{36644}{36746}Yeah. It's gonna be great.
{36747}{36794}Uh-oh, here comes horse guy.
{36800}{36887}Good luck.
{36909}{36953}You got driver's ed too.
{36959}{37035}What's the deal?|You're in every single one of my classes.
{37041}{37153}I guess great minds think alike.
{37181}{37263}Great. We got Mr Yip.|He doesn't pass anybody.
{37269}{37343}I'm sure if you don't pass,|your dad can drive you around.
{37349}{37420}It's because of my dad|that I need to get my licence.
{37426}{37498}- So you can drive "him" around?|- No. So I can drive "me" around.
{37504}{37561}- Why? Is he busy with something?|- Yeah.
{37567}{37614}He's always doing some experiment.
{37620}{37698}- Like a scientific experiment?|- Yeah, he's a scientist.
{37704}{37747}Cool. With microscopes?
{37753}{37856}You're getting weird again.
{37873}{37944}Good afternoon, children.
{37950}{38038}Driving is a privilege, not a right.
{38044}{38161}I'll be delighted to instruct you|in the operation of motor vehicle.
{38167}{38314}But I have a larger responsibility|to protect society at large
{38320}{38398}from the idiots|and the drug-addled delinquents
{38404}{38515}who call themselves the youth of today.
{38521}{38603}Today!
{38676}{38785}Your name Miss Connors? Yeah?
{38791}{38879}You're first! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
{38885}{38941}Go!
{39005}{39078}Wait! Look left. Look right.
{39084}{39170}You didn't turn on your blink.|I've never seen...
{39176}{39245}This is your left. That is right.
{39251}{39329}No. No, no, no. Get out of the driver's seat.
{39335}{39412}OK, but I...
{39453}{39559}One grandma. Multiple cones, three kerbs.
{39565}{39655}- Who can drive with you screaming?|- You fail, fail, fail!
{39661}{39777}- No. I need to get my licence!|- Next!
{39790}{39907}Damn. The floor mat isn't straight.
{39979}{40072}- All ready.|- Good.
{40172}{40275}Why are you doing that? Don't...
{40701}{40797}What are you doing now?
{41124}{41242}Stop the car! Stop the car right now!
{41344}{41391}- Did I pass?|- Nat, are you OK?
{41397}{41476}He almost rolled over!
{41482}{41562}- Come on.|- Actually, I don't feel so good.
{41568}{41637}- He totally could have killed you.|- Natalie!
{41643}{41715}Just stay away from her.
{41721}{41814}Are you OK?
{41857}{41895}You!
{41901}{41962}I will personally go to DMV.
{41968}{42109}You will not receive a driver's licence!
{42162}{42259}Never!
{42328}{42401}- Mr Yip.|- What?
{42407}{42497}We'd like to have a word with you|about Mr Banks' driver's licence.
{42503}{42567}Immigrations paper OK!
{42600}{42699}My fellow agents.
{42786}{42855}- Good luck.|- Good luck.
{42861}{42909}- He's dead.|- So dead.
{42915}{42959}Hey, Cody.
{42965}{43073}- How'd it go today?|- Great. I've got her eating outta my hand.
{43079}{43123}Fantastic.
{43129}{43277}- So she invited you to the party?|- No, but the vibes are right.
{43391}{43519}- Have you asked her out yet?|- Not yet. But don't rush me.
{43552}{43687}The clock's ticking.|Now, what's wrong with tonight?
{43750}{43849}It's a school night. I got homework.
{43974}{44059}- Cody, what's the problem?|- Nothing. But Natalie's a brain.
{44065}{44171}You got me in all those AP classes.|My workload's insane.
{44177}{44288}- This mission depends on you.|- I know, but...
{44303}{44379}Come on. Tonight I have to do|two chapters of trigonometry.
{44385}{44538}Plus I have to write an essay on "Henry V".|Not to mention my chores.
{44544}{44647}- Of course, if I had a little help...|- I can't believe what we're talking about.
{44653}{44765}All right. The Agency will take care|of your chores and your homework.
{44771}{44880}You focus on the girl.
{45356}{45479}Teams A and B,|commence domestic sanitation.
{45542}{45632}Team three, I need a new sponge.|Repeat: Need a new sponge. Over.
{45638}{45735}You missed a spot.
{45759}{45876}Negative. Negative.|Flammable. Flammable.
{45882}{45972}Which one would you prefer? This one,|or this one? I like this one myself.
{45978}{46060}- Good choice.|- Dust bunnies on the second floor.
{46066}{46184}...to develop a secret weapon.|I'm gonna transmit images now.
{46190}{46381}This is Dr Brinkman, head of ERIS.|And this, François Molay, his henchman.
{46479}{46510}Get outta the house.
{46516}{46603}What? They're not supposed|to be here for another hour.
{46609}{46641}They're here!
{46647}{46714}Move! Move!
{46720}{46825}Move, move! Get out, get out! Go, go, go!
{46995}{47076}Come on, move it. Get outta there.
{47082}{47151}Right there. Let's go!
{47157}{47185}- Get in!|- Get on with it.
{47191}{47343}Wait. Wait, wait. Wait!|You will wait for me!
{47552}{47642}Wow! What are they teaching the kid|at that new school?
{47648}{47733}Oh, my God. Look at this!
{47739}{47826}Holy...
{48003}{48074}Cody?
{48131}{48191}I know it's your dream|to play for the Sonics,
{48197}{48286}but if that falls through|you'd make somebody a good janitor.
{48292}{48357}Well, you told me to do my chores.
{48363}{48475}Honey, we are very impressed.|Here's five bucks.
{48481}{48568}- Thanks, Mom.|- Yeah.
{48828}{48950}Hey, I'm gonna go|take Marvin for a walk.
{49347}{49442}- Your homework to your satisfaction?|- Yeah.
{49448}{49511}Your room is nice and tidy?
{49517}{49588}- Guinea pig cage is clean?|- Yeah.
{49594}{49664}Well, I think we've done our part.
{49670}{49744}Now you do yours. Call Natalie.
{49750}{49804}- In here?|- Yeah.
{49810}{49847}Hurry.
{49853}{49944}I'll do it in my room.
{50025}{50117}He pooped twice.
{50349}{50473}- That wasn't me.|- I don't smell anything.
{50495}{50556}Get out! Everybody out!
{50562}{50661}Hello, Natalie. Guess who.
{50712}{50829}Hey, pretty lady. What's goin' on?
{50852}{50970}Dude. Natalie, how are you doin'?
{51025}{51199}Hi, Natalie. It's Cody. I was just wondering|what you were doing this Saturday.
{51420}{51470}Hello?
{51476}{51583}Hello? Who is this?
{51694}{51740}This mission is screwed.
{51746}{51876}We spent $10 million training this kid, and|we did not teach him how to talk to a girl?
{51882}{51949}Sir, I assure you, we had no idea.
{51955}{52061}- You're shy?|- Cody's a little delicate.
{52067}{52169}My mother's ceramic cat collection|is delicate. This is national security!
{52175}{52256}I'm sorry.
{52262}{52365}I've got reports from the training camp.|You bragged about having lots of girls!
{52371}{52505}It was camp! I exaggerated.|Everyone does.
{52545}{52632}OK. So...
{52721}{52791}What is the truth?
{52797}{52873}Well, when it comes to girls,
{52879}{52975}I suck.
{53023}{53076}Ronica, you met my dad.
{53082}{53138}Well, I'm his son.
{53144}{53310}Ladies and gentlemen, somebody has|gotta teach this kid how to talk to a girl!
{53316}{53379}I understand you're havin'|a problem with women,
{53385}{53483}so I've assembled a team of experts here|to sorta help you along
{53489}{53590}from the point of contact to the point|of closure. You gotta close, Cody.
{53596}{53649}Any species is predicated upon mating.
{53655}{53744}The males and the females must couple,|or the animal will die off.
{53750}{53839}- I'm just tryin' to get a first date.|- Let me tell you how the hyena does it.
{53845}{53940}- You see this thing here?|- There's a lot of laughing involved.
{53946}{54062}It makes you want to give the Good Lord|a standing ovation. You wanna go...
{54068}{54168}Let her know she looks fresh. Pay her|compliments about her hair and her dress.
{54174}{54231}You gotta be smart. Get some dirt on her.
{54237}{54335}They can think out of both sides of|their brain at once. Emotion and intellect.
{54341}{54454}- Check out her previous boyfriends.|- Don't be late. It's a bad start to a date.
{54460}{54547}My grandfather used to say|"Oh, son, women are like cow chips."
{54553}{54618}"The older they get,|the easier they are to pick up."
{54624}{54727}Let's take a few deep breaths|as we turn to the relationship pyramid.
{54733}{54799}You gotta be straightforward,|stern, commanding.
{54805}{54895}- He's dead now.|- Shower before seeing the girl.
{54901}{55005}No, no, no, no. You wanna be dank and|dusky and musky. She's gotta smell ya.
{55011}{55081}My father was married 100 years or so.
{55087}{55143}You gotta smell like a man. Like a beast!
{55149}{55220}He's got a ring in his neck.|You pull it, he goes "My fault."
{55226}{55315}- Like a wild animal. Like the cheetah...|- Excuse me!
{55321}{55402}If you find yourself in a difficult position,|hang on, fight it out!
{55408}{55466}Hole up. Get your energy back|for the final push!
{55472}{55542}Think like a hyena. Be a hyena.
{55548}{55643}In the fog of war, it's the one who wants it|the most that comes out on top!
{55649}{55748}And I don't think you want it the most!|I think you are a pathetic loser.
{55754}{55820}You're a disgrace to these|honourable men and women.
{55826}{55936}How are you gonna hold your head high|when you walk down the street, Banks?
{55942}{56009}- Straighten up when I talk to you!|- Thank you, General.
{56015}{56071}Get off. I'm sorry this had to happen.
{56077}{56188}OK, this one's gonna be good.
{56375}{56529}Cody, don't say I never did nothin' for you,|brother. Look at that.
{56613}{56694}Hey, Cody.
{56697}{56752}Come over here.
{56758}{56859}I'm free tonight. What shall we do?
{57131}{57184}Kid can't even talk to a simulated woman.
{57190}{57335}Maybe I should've started him out|at a more intermediate level.
{57507}{57573}Wait. No. It's a little uneven.
{57579}{57636}Up more on the right.
{57642}{57747}Yeah, that looks good. Just higher.
{58021}{58065}Are you OK?
{58071}{58118}Where did you come from?
{58124}{58212}I transferred from Jefferson High.
{58218}{58271}This'll help.
{58277}{58383}- Nurse Hatchett to the football field.|- Could you just hold this, please?
{58389}{58511}That's good. I'll be right back, OK?
{58530}{58617}You think it's broken?
{58687}{58769}- Definitely not.|- So, you're a doctor now?
{58775}{58870}Just experienced. I've broken my leg,|wrist, a couple of fingers...
{58876}{58953}- Let me guess. Driving accident.|- Summer camp.
{58959}{59063}One of those "go and try to survive|in the wilderness" places. It's crazy.
{59069}{59146}I've only been to camp once -|for gymnastics.
{59152}{59206}They never told me you took gymnastics.
{59212}{59294}Who's "they"?
{59325}{59442}OK. That's it. I have to do something.
{59476}{59543}Sorry.
{59564}{59689}So, you do gymnastics.|That's awesome.
{59711}{59782}Thank you for your help...?
{59788}{59895}- Cody.|- Cody.
{59988}{60064}You know, Cody,|you make a really bad first impression.
{60070}{60125}And a terrible second impression.
{60131}{60225}But the third time, it's really good.
{60231}{60353}- You gotta see my fourth.|- I'd like that.
{60392}{60526}It's kind of short notice, but I'm having|a birthday party this weekend, and...
{60532}{60626}- I'd love to!|- Great.
{60672}{60802}- Hello. Are you all right?|- Yes. I just need to get back to class.
{60808}{60883}- Glad this young man saved you, huh?|- We're OK here, Nurse.
{60889}{60973}- We don't need any help.|- I see here your birthday is coming up.
{60979}{61067}You know, that's none|of your business, "Nurse".
{61073}{61105}I'm gonna go.
{61111}{61215}Are you having a party? Invite Cody.|It's the least you could do. Did you?
{61221}{61310}- Yes, I did.|- You did?
{61313}{61402}Cody, I'll see you on Sunday.|Oh, the theme is Las Vegas.
{61408}{61505}All right. See you there.
{61646}{61757}Not a word. Not a word.
{61763}{61854}Be friendly. But keep a low profile.|You're not there to socialise.
{61860}{61952}ERIS may have inserted their own agents.|Casino dealers, caterers.
{61958}{62033}Anyone is suspect.
{62041}{62184}And remember, these are dangerous men.|They'll think nothing of harming you.
{62190}{62237}So use caution.
{62243}{62348}First floor of the house is a public area.|The second floor is living space.
{62354}{62501}On the beach is Connors' personal lab.|The floor plan is stored in your phone.
{62507}{62635}We'll be watching. We're only|a couple of blocks away. Hold still.
{62641}{62708}That really freaks me out.
{62714}{62805}Sorry. Ready?
{62826}{62871}Yep.
{62877}{62950}Let's go.
{62959}{63056}Why don't "you" take it?
{63160}{63257}- You did get him his licence?|- Yeah.
{63649}{63741}Here he comes.
{63762}{63829}Wait. Wait a minute.
{63835}{63932}He's at the gate.
{63960}{64032}- Name?|- Banks. Cody Banks.
{64038}{64087}You got some ID, Banks?
{64093}{64210}- You mean my driver's licence?|- Yeah.
{64383}{64472}There were no guns at "my" birthday party.
{64526}{64614}- What's this?|- My cellphone.
{64620}{64706}My MP3 player. You know these|stuffy parties. They get boring.
{64712}{64795}Yeah. You have fun.
{64944}{65019}He's in.
{65433}{65499}Oh, yeah!
{65505}{65617}That's what I'm talkin' about.
{65733}{65822}Guys, I'm 15, you know.
{66359}{66456}I'll see you guys later.
{66683}{66740}- Hey, Cody.|- Hey, Natalie. How's your ankle?
{66746}{66840}It's much better, but I think I'll hold off|on the cartwheels for a while.
{66846}{66939}- You don't wanna have too much fun.|- No.
{66945}{67013}Do you want something|to drink or anything?
{67019}{67080}Happy birthday.
{67086}{67178}Thank you.
{67201}{67313}Wow. I love it. It's beautiful.
{67321}{67423}- Can you help me?|- Sure.
{67591}{67638}Sorry.
{67644}{67750}I'm kinda new at this.
{67866}{67924}- Turquoise is my favourite.|- I know.
{67930}{68018}- You're not supposed to know that.|- I know!
{68024}{68170}- What?|- Sorry. Just this stupid voice in my head.
{68224}{68330}I have to go play hostess. Fenster! Why|am I not surprised you're the first person...
{68336}{68388}Don't ever interrupt me again!
{68394}{68431}Watch it, or you're going in.
{68437}{68532}- It won't happen again, I promise.|- Yeah, right.
{68538}{68647}Place your bets.|{y:i}Faites vos jeux.
{68691}{68788}10,000, red seven.
{68798}{68865}10,000, black 13.
{68871}{68950}No more bets.|{y:i}Rien ne va plus.
{68956}{69048}Red seven.
{69074}{69148}Thank you.
{69209}{69316}Sir, it's just play money.
{69930}{70012}Guys.
{70036}{70109}Brinkman.
{70538}{70635}This way, Mr Brinkman.
{70941}{71018}- Let's see what they're up to.|- Wait till it's clear.
{71024}{71132}No, I'll be OK. I'm going down.
{72489}{72615}- I'm on the roof of the lab.|- Be careful. It's full of motion sensors.
{73556}{73673}I hope you haven't spent|all our money on real estate.
{73679}{73804}Please don't touch anything. I'll give you|a demonstration in just a minute.
{73810}{73879}Dr Connors,|are you prepared to mass-produce?
{73885}{73992}Yes, but without freezing temperatures,|I can't control the nanobots.
{73998}{74077}No problem. We'll supply you|with all the ice you'll ever need.
{74083}{74133}Hey! No!
{74139}{74205}In this one cube,|how many nanobots are there?
{74211}{74344}About 40,000. And as soon as it starts to|melt, they destroy everything in their path.
{74350}{74438}Let's find out.
{74485}{74574}See if they can eat this.
{75246}{75299}Temperature's rising. Turning to liquid.
{75305}{75427}- Thermocontainment disabled.|- Entering the chamber.
{75433}{75554}As you can see,|the nanobots are ignoring the glass.
{75560}{75644}They're programmed|to destroy only the metal.
{75650}{75777}But if you stick your finger in, your body|temperature confuses it and you'll lose it.
{75783}{75851}Painfully.
{75857}{75893}Look at those buggers go.
{75899}{76001}They're like little Pac-Men.
{76007}{76076}Now, say, what is that thing, by the way?
{76082}{76193}Just the guidance system to a Russian|SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missile.
{76199}{76297}- Are you getting this?|- The Americans use similar components.
{76303}{76351}Congratulations.
{76357}{76502}You just gave us the power to neutralise|America's entire strategic arsenal.
{76508}{76601}And leave it defenceless.
{76640}{76714}You'll never get the nanobots|into a military facility.
{76720}{76752}Yes, we will.
{76758}{76821}Wait a second. That wasn't the deal.
{76827}{76962}The deal was: You finance the project,|I decide what we do with the technology.
{76968}{77010}No, no, no, no, no.
{77016}{77196}You are going to program them|to march in like a column of ants.
{77202}{77249}Now,
{77255}{77362}shall we join your daughter?
{77412}{77502}Thermocontainment engaged.
{77508}{77611}System activated.
{77662}{77799}- I think they're leaving.|- Get a sample of those nanobots.
{78032}{78121}Goin' in.
{79485}{79562}Bravo, Agent Banks.
{79603}{79716}I've got one thing to say:|Mission accomplished.
{79943}{80023}The ice is melting|and they're eating my shoe!
{80029}{80117}System alert, zone two.
{80119}{80163}What's that?
{80169}{80292}- Seems to be some activity in the lab.|- What sort of activity?
{80345}{80390}Get him back. Get him back!
{80396}{80464}The detectors are sensitive.|It's probably an insect.
{80470}{80559}Or not. François.
{80723}{80833}- Code, Doctor. Hurry up!|- I'm going as fast as I can.
{80839}{80926}Hurry up! Come on!
{80956}{81048}- Come on!|- OK, OK.
{81501}{81563}Ducks!
{81573}{81672}False alarm. All clear.
{81894}{81971}Horse boy! Where'd you steal|that car from? Can't be yours.
{81977}{82092}- You can only afford one shoe.|- Not right now. I'm really fried.
{82098}{82165}Well, maybe we should|cool you off with a swim.
{82171}{82205}- Yeah!|- Let's do it!
{82211}{82303}- You guys, come on.|- Pick him up!
{82309}{82441}- Goin' in!|- Hold on. Let me fix his tie.
{83059}{83156}You're really starting to annoy me.
{83483}{83612}He's in every single one of my classes.
{83745}{83805}His moves are straight|outta the CIA handbook.
{83811}{83938}I thought we got rid|of the CIA with Bolivar.
{83957}{84042}Now they've sent a kid. Very impressive.
{84048}{84110}Commence ERIS|child recruitment immediately.
{84116}{84181}I've never been so good with kids.
{84187}{84335}I've noticed. We've gotta get out of here|immediately. Grab Connors.
{84341}{84513}But I did a really good job! Ronica,|they can't pull me off this mission!
{84519}{84591}Secret Agent Cody Banks.
{84597}{84683}You've made the school newspaper.
{84689}{84791}I think it's safe to say|you've blown your cover.
{84797}{84904}We'll take it from here. You'll stay|at Donovan for another two weeks.
{84910}{84975}And you will stay away|from Natalie Connors.
{84981}{85049}I can't. I can't do that. She trusts me.
{85055}{85164}You can and you will. It's your job. You|knew that when you picked this career.
{85170}{85249}I didn't pick this career! It picked "me".
{85255}{85350}I subscribed to a few spy magazines|and surfed the Net for some cool sites.
{85356}{85451}The next thing I know, I'm going|to a CIA summer camp. I was 13!
{85457}{85566}And now you're old enough|to know the rules.
{85572}{85625}Here.
{85631}{85697}This is for good luck.
{85703}{85811}You might still be in danger.|And we'll keep an eye on you.
{85817}{85936}To keep me safe|or to keep me from Natalie?
{86267}{86388}ERIS THERMO LAB
{86413}{86472}Dr Connors, why is there a slowdown?
{86478}{86548}We gave you every piece|of equipment you've asked for.
{86554}{86675}You have absolutely, unequivocally,|run out of excuses. What's the problem?
{86681}{86786}I will not use science to destroy the world.
{86792}{86891}You pompous, know-all little nerd!
{86897}{87045}François, I think he needs|a little motivation.
{87270}{87357}I'll get it.
{87459}{87545}- Hey, Cody.|- Natalie!
{87716}{87812}Hi, Mr and Mrs Banks.|Hi. Nice to meet you.
{87818}{87875}Nice to meet you too.
{87881}{87918}That was a girl.
{87924}{87961}A hot girl.
{87967}{88113}- Here you go. Two pistachios.|- Thanks.
{88161}{88239}I cannot believe that|you like pistachio ice cream.
{88245}{88305}We have so much in common, Cody.
{88311}{88409}So, tell me again why|we had to sneak out the back door.
{88415}{88509}Natalie, there's something|I have to tell you.
{88515}{88583}You don't have to say anything. I know.
{88589}{88631}You do?
{88637}{88711}Yeah. And...
{88717}{88776}I think I feel the same way too.
{88782}{88931}Oh, man! Natalie, I'm not the person you...
{88956}{89041}Eat your burger.
{89085}{89174}Come on!
{89381}{89468}What is going on here?
{89501}{89556}Get outta the way!
{89562}{89665}Your dad got involved with|some nasty people.
{89792}{89909}- Cody!|- Take care of him!
{90063}{90155}Get in...
{90157}{90267}Get in that car!
{90988}{91033}Wake up.
{91039}{91136}Hello.
{91212}{91341}They took Natalie.|She's been kidnapped! She's gone!
{91347}{91401}You should've stayed away from her.
{91407}{91453}Don't worry. OK?
{91459}{91545}- We're gonna get her back.|- Let me help.
{91551}{91660}The director issued explicit orders.
{91817}{91893}- So, what happens to me?|- Just go to school.
{91899}{92036}Hang out with your friends.|Do your homework. Be a kid.
{92053}{92179}- See you later, man.|- It was good workin' with you, Cody.
{92212}{92291}See you later, kid.
{92426}{92518}{y:i}Buenas noches, Banks.
{92600}{92685}See ya.
{92981}{93046}Are you OK? Where have you been?|What happened?
{93052}{93139}Cody. Cody.
{93176}{93293}- Did that girl do this to you?|- No. The bullies we met. It's no big deal.
{93299}{93373}- And then you protected her.|- Kinda.
{93379}{93448}- What were you doing out so late?|- We just talked!
{93454}{93524}So you're OK? Are you sure?
{93530}{93696}Well, in that case, you are so grounded!|Do you have any idea what time it is?
{93704}{93806}OK, go to your room!
{93813}{93911}- I'm in the fire level. Where are you?|- I'm still on level two...
{93917}{93965}- Alex!|- I gotta go.
{93971}{94028}I told you not to touch my stuff.|Gimme that!
{94034}{94115}- It's a Game Boy. I know what I'm doing.|- This stuff is special.
{94121}{94210}So's the phone. Give it to me!
{94216}{94321}If you want to disable the surveillance|lock, press pound-one-five.
{94327}{94367}To return to the main menu...
{94373}{94431}- Who's he?|- A guy from the phone company.
{94437}{94519}- What guy from the phone company?|- What do you care?
{94525}{94638}You think I'm stupid?|What's going on here?
{94642}{94783}Fine. I'm a junior secret agent working|for the CIA. They gave me this stuff.
{94789}{94894}- Happy?|- Whatever.
{94907}{94949}- What's this?|- I don't know.
{94955}{95114}It's been doing that for a couple of hours.|I think the battery's low or something.
{95283}{95363}- Turquoise is my favourite.|- I know.
{95369}{95481}She still has the microsensor.
{95490}{95592}She's in the Cascade Mountains.
{95598}{95705}Please, the director has gotta talk to me!|This is important!
{95711}{95775}- What about Ronica Miles?|- She's not available.
{95781}{95843}- Can you track her down?|- I'm sorry, Mr Banks.
{95849}{95961}- Will anybody take my call?|- Sorry.
{95967}{96091}- I have to go.|- You can't leave. You're grounded.
{96097}{96132}Alex...
{96138}{96263}how would you like to become|a junior "junior" agent?
{96269}{96348}What's in it for me?
{96780}{96834}Hey, Rosychuk. Open the doors.
{96840}{96890}Yeah.
{96896}{96969}- You don't need to see a badge?|- No. Not from you.
{96975}{97057}Didn't think so.
{97770}{97841}- I'm worried about Cody.|- What?
{97847}{97898}- We haven't heard a peep out of him.|- Who?
{97904}{97962}Maybe I was a little hard on him.
{97968}{98110}- I think I'm just gonna go check on him.|- Alex, go to bed.
{98148}{98203}Hello?
{98209}{98308}Hello?
{98503}{98559}Cody?
{98565}{98614}- You all right?|- I guess.
{98620}{98749}- Are you gonna stay in here all night?|- I guess.
{98755}{98839}- All right, are you mad at me and Dad?|- I guess.
{98845}{98991}Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you gonna|disobey us again and stay out late?
{98997}{99084}I guess.
{99096}{99176}Just kidding.
{99182}{99241}All right, then.
{99247}{99334}Good night.
{100181}{100299}I need to get to Red Face.
{101175}{101252}- He stole the car?|- And a few other items, sir.
{101258}{101305}He's gone after Connors' daughter.
{101311}{101377}- You have to admire his perseverance.|- No, I don't!
{101383}{101454}Resisting orders.|Stealing government property.
{101460}{101581}My camp wasn't training operatives, it|was training hoodlums! This is your fault.
{101587}{101649}Now, you find that punk!
{101655}{101728}Or I'm gonna have your job!
{101734}{101846}- Who let him in here, anyway?|- Me. Rosychuk.

{106645}{106743}Oh, no.
{106775}{106891}- Need any help?|- No, I'm fine.
{107320}{107420}How'd you find me? I threw away|that transceiver you put on me.
{107426}{107559}It wasn't a transceiver. It was an 18-carat|gold pin that my mentor gave to me.
{107565}{107587}Sorry.
{107593}{107764}Don't you think the CIA has LoJack|on its stuff? Even that board has one.
{108005}{108122}- What are you doing?|- What do you think? Getting the board.
{108128}{108183}You can hop on with me instead.
{108189}{108310}Listen, I'm not going back with you.|I'm here to rescue Natalie.

{111942}{112016}So that's how they're doing it.|The ice cubes.
{112022}{112090}That's how they plan|to distribute the nanobots.
{112096}{112218}Everyone uses ice cubes.|No one would know what hit them.
{112411}{112507}It's so difficult to get good sushi|in the mountains, François.
{112513}{112604}- How's the girl?|- She's trouble.
{112610}{112755}She's 15 years old.|How much trouble can she be?

{114166}{114261}It's that kid again.
{114421}{114492}Go get him.
{114498}{114534}It must be love.
{114540}{114696}- You're not gonna propose, are you?|- No, I'm just hiding from the camera.
{114743}{114822}Look, I work for the CIA.
{114828}{114893}- Yeah, right.|- No, really, I'm serious.
{114899}{114992}I'm in the Agent Development Program.|Getting to you was my first job.
{114998}{115143}- And why did you need to get to me?|- To get to your dad.
{115171}{115258}Great! So...
{115275}{115359}So you just used me?
{115517}{115671}I cannot believe what an idiot I am!|Cody, I thought you were different.
{115933}{115982}Listen.
{115988}{116062}In the beginning,|it was just my assignment.
{116068}{116163}But towards the end, they...
{116169}{116256}They what?
{116256}{116341}They pulled me off the job.
{116347}{116424}Why?
{116428}{116505}They pulled me off the job because...
{116511}{116663}I was getting too emotionally|attached to the subject.
{116675}{116756}We gotta go - now.
{116762}{116849}Cody, what is|the school nurse doing here?
{116855}{116995}- Well, I was gonna tell you, but...|- Hello. Ronica Miles, CIA. Let's go.
{117001}{117036}- We gotta go.|- Let's go.
{117042}{117098}Sorry.
{117191}{117319}Hi, fellas. We were just leaving.

{118659}{118745}Where is my dad?
{118751}{118847}I'm not going to tell you.

{119752}{119843}I'm going to place this ice cube|containing thousands of nanobots
{119849}{119907}- on your daughter's forehead.|- No!
{119913}{119983}Program the nanobots|to obey that remote control.
{119989}{120106}If you don't, her body temperature|will cause the ice to melt,
{120112}{120198}releasing the nanobots,|which will eat away indiscriminately.
{120204}{120287}Dad, don't do it!
{120293}{120339}I'll do it. Just let her go.
{120345}{120445}Program the remote,|that's exactly what I'll do.
{120451}{120538}Stay cold, Natalie.
{120631}{120707}Look at the water|on your daughter's forehead, Doctor.
{120713}{120803}I can't do it this quick.|This is a very complicated process.

{120909}{120957}Let her go!
{120963}{121125}- What are you gonna do about it?|- Blow this place up! Now let Natalie go!
