1
00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:02,323
Previously on Sleepy Hollow.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,341
What's this about?

3
00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:05,287
- Who are you?
- Katrina Crane.

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,530
This is a dream?

5
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:08,040
You're the man Abbie
told me about.

6
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:09,585
The Sin Eater.

7
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:13,897
- A family tree.
- You're a descendant of Grace Dixon.

8
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:16,221
- It's time.
- I saw Katrina giving birth.

9
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:17,421
My son.

10
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:19,333
- What did you say?
- I had a vision.

11
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,631
I'm sorry,
you must be mistaken.

12
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,003
She would've told me.

13
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:28,639
She needed to keep
it secret.

14
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:31,556
What happened to my son?

15
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:46,636
Chopping down a
Christmas tree?

16
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:50,080
An altogether
nonsensical concept.

17
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:54,009
Celebrating Yuletide with
a titular display of lumber.

18
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:57,181
Wow. Bah, humbug
to you, too, Ebenezer.

19
00:00:57,214 --> 00:00:58,566
That was all gibberish.

20
00:00:58,597 --> 00:00:59,366
Scrooge.

21
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:00,674
He's a Dickensian character.

22
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,488
A grump.

23
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,058
Well, you guys had Christmas,
right?

24
00:01:04,091 --> 00:01:05,154
Santa Claus...

25
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:06,599
Snowmen...

26
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:07,807
Eggnog.

27
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:12,468
In my era, the term
was "egg and grog."

28
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:14,864
A draught made of rum
that led inevitably

29
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,966
to an aching head,
ergo, "noggin."

30
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,635
Abbreviated to "nog."

31
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:24,507
I get why you're upset.

32
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,443
Do you, now?

33
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:29,512
You find out you had a son...

34
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,648
and you never got to know him.

35
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:34,918
I am sorry, Crane.

36
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:37,787
If I were you, I'd be taking
an ax to something, too.

37
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:40,690
My head is swimming
with questions.

38
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:43,126
What was he like?

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,262
What did he know of me?

40
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:48,197
How did he live?

41
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:55,471
And why did Katrina not tell me
she was with child?

42
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:58,341
She put you in that cave
to protect you.

43
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:02,879
I got to assume she kept it
a secret for the same reason.

44
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:07,583
Moloch hunted them both down
centuries ago.

45
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:09,686
While I'm yet
to know the reason,

46
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,188
it suggests that
their fates will come to bear

47
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:14,390
in our war against him now.

48
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:18,194
That is why we must find out
what happened to my son.

49
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:21,164
And we shall start by
endeavoring to contact Katrina.

50
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:23,499
How do you plan
on doing that, exactly?

51
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:25,702
When she came to me,
it seemed like

52
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:28,171
she had to move mountains
to do it.

53
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:31,574
Those are some
pretty freaky mountains.

54
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:37,080
You expecting company?

55
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:39,182
Indeed.

56
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:42,251
The only man I know capable
of moving freaky mountains.

57
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:47,023
You called Parrish? Why?

58
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:49,258
Put yourself in my place.

59
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,427
How far would you go
for answers?

60
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,363
All the way.

61
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,435
Mr. Parrish,
thank you for coming.

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,005
Don't touch me, please.

63
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,175
Apologies, Mr. Crane.

64
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,078
It's not a good idea
to touch me.

65
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:11,581
Of course.

66
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:13,516
I appreciate
your hasty arrival.

67
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:16,719
Shall we venture indoors?

68
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:19,756
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

69
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,057
I'm a Sin Eater;

70
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:24,160
I-I-I can read, and at times,

71
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:25,928
remove sins, that's all.

72
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:27,263
No, that's not all.

73
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:29,732
You have the power
to reach across realms.

74
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:32,568
You summoned a man long dead
and brought him to me.

75
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:33,803
Summon him!

76
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:35,705
With all your heart!

77
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:38,174
Here into this room!

78
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,643
Now open your eyes.

79
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:43,246
You must have the ability
to reach Katrina.

80
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,547
Purgatory.

81
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:50,253
It isn't anything
I've ever tried before.

82
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:51,921
Please.

83
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:54,424
I beg you.

84
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,059
Yeah, all right.

85
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:58,227
I'll make an attempt.
That's all I can promise.

86
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:00,263
I've never used my gift

87
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:02,799
for a purpose
beyond removing sins.

88
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,001
Now, you listen very carefully.

89
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:07,236
A mortal soul has no place

90
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:10,206
in the realm of the dead.

91
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,408
Your life will be in danger.

92
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:15,745
I will have to put it in danger.

93
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,113
I understand the risk.

94
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:19,682
Oh, no, you don't.

95
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:23,119
Our lives are a tapestry.

96
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:24,821
Each moment

97
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:29,525
is a thread upon which
the next thread is woven.

98
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,094
When you reach

99
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:32,528
beyond this existence,

100
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,832
as you're about to,
you are tempting fate.

101
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:37,767
I cannot say what consequences

102
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,335
will befall you.

103
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:42,705
The consequences of inaction
weigh far greater with me, sir.

104
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,574
Henry.

105
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:48,111
Under the circumstances,
"Henry" will be fine.

106
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:51,280
This will frighten you.

107
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:53,716
Once I begin,
you must not stop me,

108
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,218
no matter how much you want to.

109
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,352
If you have any doubt,

110
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:58,688
now would be a good time
to make your exit.

111
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,492
Thanks for the warning.
We're not going anywhere.

112
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:05,628
Come.

113
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:06,996
Come.

114
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:10,166
Think of your wife.

115
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,669
Summon her with all your heart.

116
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:17,874
What I'm about to do
will bring you closer to her...

117
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,842
and closer to death.

118
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:23,146
I'm ready.

119
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:27,517
Henry!

120
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:30,653
I told you:

121
00:05:30,687 --> 00:05:33,022
the closer he is to death,

122
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:36,092
the shorter distance
he is to travel.

123
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:05,521
Katrina?

124
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:16,199
No, no, no, no.
How are you here?

125
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,100
The Sin Eater.

126
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:19,936
Moloch is always near.

127
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,104
If he learns of
your presence...

128
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,906
Is it true we have a son?

129
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,446
I would have told you
when you first awoke,

130
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,548
but we've had fleeting moments

131
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,317
of precious time.

132
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:36,219
We made a covenant
when we married.

133
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:38,221
You owe me the truth.

134
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:42,725
His name.

135
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,661
Jeremy.

136
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,965
Our son's name was Jeremy.

137
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,870
After your grandfather.

138
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:58,608
I did not know I was with child
when I buried you in that cave.

139
00:06:58,642 --> 00:07:00,776
Fortunately,
neither did my coven.

140
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:03,679
They sought to punish me
for saving your life.

141
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,224
It was only when I fled

142
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:07,209
to Europe in search of a spell

143
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:10,179
to unbind you from the Horseman
that I learned of my condition.

144
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:14,650
When my quest failed,
I returned home

145
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,552
to my coven's
relentless pursuit.

146
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:20,990
If I did not reveal
where I buried you,

147
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,192
they would condemn me
to a fate worse than death.

148
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:29,465
I knew then
they would not stop until

149
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:31,167
they had us both, so I fled...

150
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:37,340
- Fredericks Manor.
- Come on.

151
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,742
- I delivered our son under Lachlan and Grace's care.
- Hurry. Get her inside.

152
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,877
Push!

153
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:44,914
Mrs. Crane, it's a boy.

154
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:48,117
He was the most beautiful
creature I had ever seen.

155
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,586
He had your eyes.

156
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,688
But I couldn't keep him.

157
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,558
Not whilst your coven
was bent on revenge.

158
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:58,561
That would have
endangered his life as well.

159
00:07:58,595 --> 00:08:01,764
I could not condemn our son
to a life as a fugitive.

160
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,232
To protect him,

161
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:06,202
in order to give him
a brighter future, I...

162
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,404
I had to let him go.

163
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:13,042
One day we'll see each other
again, little lord.

164
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:17,413
And I will hold you in my dreams
every night until then.

165
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:20,883
You are my heart and soul,
Jeremy Crane.

166
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,619
And always will be.

167
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:24,854
I made you a little friend.

168
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,727
He will watch over you
while I'm away.

169
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:35,231
He will make sure
that you are safe...

170
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,200
and that you are never,
ever alone.

171
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,709
I left him in the care

172
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,544
of Grace
and her husband Joseph,

173
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:50,046
a pastor at Trinity Church.

174
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:01,991
And that was the last time
I laid eyes

175
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:03,826
on our son.

176
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,630
This is an echo of that place,

177
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:11,734
purgatory's cruel way of
confronting me with my choice...

178
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:13,335
until I am freed.

179
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,371
So I come here once a day

180
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:16,639
and I light a candle

181
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:19,175
in memoriam,
and I pray for his soul.

182
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,312
Your own coven
banished you here?

183
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:25,948
I was put here by sisters
with great power,

184
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,417
known as
"The Four Who Speak As One."

185
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:31,087
I am so sorry, my love,

186
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:33,222
but I had no choice
but to give him up

187
00:09:33,256 --> 00:09:34,457
in order to save him.

188
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,560
I will find out what happened
to our son.

189
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,929
I will free you from this hell.

190
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:44,066
We will defeat Moloch
and we will be together again.

191
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,734
I swear.

192
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,756
You must leave.
Release your will

193
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:55,845
to be here and you will
return to your realm.

194
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,214
Do it now! Go!

195
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,152
Crane?

196
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,153
Crane?!

197
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,421
He'll be all right.

198
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:08,491
His... his body is experiencing
a physical reaction.

199
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:12,161
You strangled me.

200
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,197
He means "thank you."

201
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,169
Your ancestor Grace...

202
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,538
she took custody of my child.

203
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:26,075
It seems your fates were merged
before you met.

204
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:29,512
And the fate of my son
remains a mystery.

205
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,180
We'll do everything
we can to find out

206
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,015
what happened to him, Crane.

207
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:35,918
I promise.

208
00:11:27,943 --> 00:11:29,383
We don't even know if any

209
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:30,384
of your descendants
are still alive.

210
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,587
Well, if Jeremy married

211
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,055
and had three children,

212
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,423
the average at the time,

213
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:39,594
then we compound that number
over eight generations...

214
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:44,465
I could have as many as...

215
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,901
6,000 offspring.

216
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:48,936
6,000 little Ichabods.

217
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:50,705
I have an idea.

218
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:54,108
The Historical Society Library.

219
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:56,944
They have a rare records
collection dating back

220
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:59,614
to Revolutionary-era
Sleepy Hollow.

221
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:00,848
That's where we start.

222
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:02,016
Officer Mills!

223
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,085
My train leaves in 18 minutes.

224
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:06,187
We're five minutes away.

225
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:07,521
You'll be all right.

226
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:10,491
Well, if it's all the same,
I'd rather not presume.

227
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:14,595
Mr. Parrish...

228
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,596
Henry...

229
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:18,432
I beg you a further request.

230
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,835
Please, Mr. Crane.

231
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:24,572
The 8:05 p.m. train, seat 15B.

232
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,774
I do my crosswords,
they settle me.

233
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:28,542
You saved my life.

234
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:30,578
You granted me
passage to Katrina.

235
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,582
You have a purpose with us.
My purpose

236
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:36,250
was to separate you
from the Horseman

237
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:38,152
so that you could continue

238
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:41,155
the work for which
you have been called.

239
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:42,790
Both of you.
And that is where

240
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:44,825
my contribution ends.

241
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,960
Henry.

242
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:48,229
You know...

243
00:12:48,263 --> 00:12:51,232
when I found your file
the first time,

244
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,400
I noticed...

245
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:54,602
your mother, she died
when you were young.

246
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:57,505
Cancer.

247
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:59,540
Such a perfect word for it.

248
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:00,775
Your father

249
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:03,477
has been in a nursing home
the last ten years.

250
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:05,313
Alzheimer's, I think it is.

251
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:07,348
You have no other family?

252
00:13:07,382 --> 00:13:09,583
We're pretty thin
on it ourselves.

253
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:11,919
If we don't find out more

254
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:14,088
about the little
that we did have...

255
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:16,791
Crane's son
and how we're all connected...

256
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:18,626
we may not be able to do

257
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,161
the work that we have
been called to do.

258
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:21,362
And then all your
incredible help

259
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:23,130
will be for nothing.

260
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:30,771
There's a train

261
00:13:30,806 --> 00:13:35,142
that leaves at 12:44 a.m.

262
00:13:35,177 --> 00:13:37,978
Give me your word I'll be on it.

263
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:40,014
You have my word.

264
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,009
Frank, what brings
you back to the church?

265
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:12,113
I remember a sermon
you gave once...

266
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:13,547
about the two witnesses,

267
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,683
prophets of the Apocalypse.
Mm-hmm.

268
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:16,751
"Two olive trees

269
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:19,086
who stand before
the Lord of the Earth."

270
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,622
Symbolism, allegory...

271
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:22,623
literal?

272
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:23,858
You could ask those questions

273
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:25,393
about all the Scriptures.

274
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:27,294
Some people believe
they're absolute truths,

275
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:29,397
others see them as parables.

276
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,098
What happens to the witnesses?

277
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,334
According to the New
Testament, "witness"

278
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:34,969
means "martyr."

279
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:36,804
They're destined to die
for their testimonies.

280
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:40,393
What happens to the people
that follow them?

281
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:43,577
Apostles usually suffer
the same fate as the martyr.

282
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:47,381
You know I joined the service
because I wanted to help people?

283
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:52,887
Then my little girl
got hit by a car.

284
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:57,825
When I joined the force,

285
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:59,860
I was gone so often
my wife left me.

286
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:05,166
And now you're telling me

287
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,802
that the grand prize
for a life of public service

288
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:09,937
might be death.

289
00:15:09,971 --> 00:15:12,406
You have to have faith
in the Lord's plan, Frank.

290
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:14,442
He always has a plan.

291
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:17,745
Oh...

292
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:20,181
If God has a plan, who's it for?

293
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,018
Me or him?

294
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:29,757
Frank...

295
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,125
what aren't you telling me?

296
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,526
What's happening to you, Frank?

297
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:34,595
I remember why
I stopped coming here.

298
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:39,967
From the 18th century?

299
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:41,135
No.

300
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:42,736
I don't think
we have any records

301
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:44,004
on Trinity Church.

302
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,475
Madam, this town has existed
since Adriaen van der Donck

303
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,144
dubbed it
"Sleeper's Haven" in 1655.

304
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:52,613
Surely there must
be some reference

305
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:53,948
to its many houses of worship

306
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:56,183
in the town's
Historical Society.

307
00:15:56,218 --> 00:15:58,285
You speak with such
authority on the past.

308
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,653
Without books,

309
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:02,456
we have neither
a past nor a future.

310
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:04,225
I would've thought
a librarian above all

311
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,593
would comprehend that.

312
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:11,899
If we have anything
on Trinity Church,

313
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:14,301
it would be in that
section over there.

314
00:16:14,336 --> 00:16:15,703
Feel free to look.

315
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:19,073
I'll be in the back.

316
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,750
Mistletoe.

317
00:16:29,784 --> 00:16:31,685
That, you recognize.

318
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:35,356
An enduring tradition,

319
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,260
to the imminent peril
of all the pretty housemaids.

320
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:42,596
Let's get to work.

321
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:45,766
I found it.

322
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:49,136
Grace Martha Dixon.

323
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,740
Born 1751...

324
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:54,742
died 1784.

325
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,010
She was a young woman.

326
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:58,245
It says here, according
to eyewitness accounts,

327
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,047
there was a fire.

328
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:01,081
They were trapped inside.

329
00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:03,517
The local townspeople

330
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:04,552
were afraid of Jeremy.

331
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:06,453
People claimed
they had seen him

332
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:08,255
start fires...

333
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,256
just by crying.

334
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:13,027
Katrina's powers...

335
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:14,728
He inherited them.

336
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:16,263
After the house burned down,

337
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:17,898
they found the boy
the next morning,

338
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,633
completely unhurt.

339
00:17:19,668 --> 00:17:20,968
People came to believe

340
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:22,636
he was some kind of monster.

341
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:24,538
After that, he was
sent to a home

342
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:26,574
for orphan children of the war.

343
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,243
What happened to my child?

344
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:30,911
It doesn't say.

345
00:17:32,414 --> 00:17:34,181
My son...

346
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:37,117
was responsible for
the death of your ancestors.

347
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:39,019
It's not your fault.

348
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:40,588
There's nothing
you could've done.

349
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:41,755
I could've been there.

350
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,390
That is a not a choice

351
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,426
you were given, my friend.

352
00:17:46,861 --> 00:17:48,596
I'm so sorry.

353
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,197
To both of you.

354
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:53,667
I feared opening
these doors would be painful.

355
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:56,070
The home to which
my son was sent...

356
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:57,404
does it have a name?

357
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,405
There's nothing here.

358
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,740
And don't count on Miss Helpful

359
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:01,141
guiding us in
the right direction.

360
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,710
Oh...

361
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:04,511
she knows more
than she's telling.

362
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:08,549
Lying is a sin.

363
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:12,820
I can sense a sin a mile away.

364
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:19,860
She's gone.

365
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:23,597
Outside.

366
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:38,479
God...

367
00:18:38,513 --> 00:18:40,381
What could've done this?

368
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:43,550
I won't be catching
that later train, will I?

369
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:50,434
Macey, your dad is here.

370
00:18:50,468 --> 00:18:52,502
Okay, Mom. In a minute.

371
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:53,904
So how's life in the small city?

372
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:55,238
Big city was quieter.

373
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:56,340
Well, that's you in a nutshell.

374
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,075
Whenever you were here,
you wanted to go.

375
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,510
Whenever you were gone,
you wished that

376
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:01,945
you were here.

377
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:06,917
Cynthia...

378
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:08,552
I know that I made
it hard on you.

379
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:10,087
Always being gone.

380
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:12,556
I just want you to know...

381
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,726
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,728
You deserve better.

383
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:25,335
You know, if you would've
told me that a year ago...

384
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,771
you would still be living
in this house.

385
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:30,374
I do now.

386
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:32,943
Popski!

387
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:35,078
Little Bean!

388
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:40,817
Bye, Mama.

389
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:42,152
Bye-bye, honey.

390
00:19:42,186 --> 00:19:43,553
You have fun, okay?

391
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:45,122
Okay.

392
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:46,823
Bye.

393
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:53,630
The librarian's personal effects
just came in from impound.

394
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:57,100
These are all of the
archivist's possessions?

395
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:00,604
Just from her office at work.

396
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:02,239
Apparently, she has
a personal safe.

397
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:04,307
You doing crosswords?
As I said,

398
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:05,909
it distracts me
from my troubles.

399
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,844
A good puzzle

400
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:08,845
misleads you.

401
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,380
It sends you in one direction,

402
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:12,749
fools you into thinking
you know what's going on.

403
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:16,353
But once you've
discovered the trick,

404
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:18,789
you see that there's often
a hidden meaning.

405
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:20,991
Just as the librarian
was trying to conceal

406
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:22,626
something from us.

407
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,127
You don't, perhaps,

408
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:26,396
know an unusual word for

409
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:27,831
"fidgety and restless," do you?

410
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:28,965
Gumplefik.

411
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:31,368
Gumplefik?

412
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:32,702
A perfect fit.

413
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:34,104
I'm still reconciling

414
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,839
today's language
and its advancements.

415
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,174
For example, in my era,

416
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,376
a "toilet" was
a vanity cabinet,

417
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,679
"intercourse" was simply
"social conversation,"

418
00:20:42,713 --> 00:20:45,382
"awful" meant
"awe-inspiring"...

419
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,151
So if I went out with a guy
and we had "awful intercourse,"

420
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:49,653
we'd be going on a second date?

421
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:52,222
Disconcerting, yet accurate.

422
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:53,490
That's just weird.

423
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:57,828
What's wrong?

424
00:20:57,862 --> 00:20:59,663
The box...

425
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:02,332
it's filled with pain.

426
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:05,368
This symbol...

427
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:08,472
it's the crest
of Katrina's coven,

428
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:10,340
the Sisterhood of

429
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:11,374
the Radiant Heart.

430
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:12,509
Only a member of the Sisterhood

431
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:14,344
would possess such an item.

432
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:15,679
Seriously?

433
00:21:15,713 --> 00:21:18,882
The librarian from the
Historical Society was a witch?

434
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,218
Just as Reverend Knapp
was before her,

435
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:24,387
embedded in Sleepy Hollow
for centuries.

436
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:26,590
It explains her expression:

437
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,024
recognition.

438
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,526
She knew who you were.

439
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:34,431
Whatever is in there,

440
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:36,900
it reeks

441
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:38,535
of anger

442
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:40,637
and pain and death.

443
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:42,405
It's stronger than anything

444
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
I've felt in years.

445
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:48,011
He will make sure
that you are safe.

446
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,550
This drawing...

447
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:58,722
it's familiar.

448
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:00,690
I've seen this doll.

449
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:03,360
When Katrina came to me
in the dream or the vision

450
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:04,561
or whatever it was,

451
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:05,695
there was a baby carriage.

452
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,098
The doll was in it.

453
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:09,599
May I see it, please?

454
00:22:19,644 --> 00:22:22,412
The pain,

455
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:24,214
the misery inside that box...

456
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:27,017
I think it's your son's.

457
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:32,455
The priest who governed
the orphanage...

458
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,926
I can feel the darkness
of his heart.

459
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:38,929
No food until penance.

460
00:22:38,963 --> 00:22:40,430
The priest believed

461
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:42,032
there was only one way

462
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:43,700
of purging
the boy's affliction.

463
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:46,436
Until one day,

464
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,607
the child's pain
swelled in him so deeply,

465
00:22:50,641 --> 00:22:53,243
he summoned the promise
of his mother's wish.

466
00:22:53,277 --> 00:22:55,078
And with a single drop
of blood,

467
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:59,316
discovered the true strength
of his power.

468
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:38,521
Jeremy...
manifested his rage,

469
00:23:38,556 --> 00:23:39,956
his grief,

470
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,993
in the absence of someone
to protect him.

471
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:46,863
He made real a champion
to keep him safe.

472
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:49,466
This violence we've seen,

473
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,301
I believe it's the handiwork
of this champion.

474
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:52,402
You don't know that.

475
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:53,837
I've seen this creature before

476
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,438
in Katrina's purgatory.

477
00:23:57,508 --> 00:24:00,510
When I returned
to the cabin, I...

478
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:01,978
I could still feel

479
00:24:02,013 --> 00:24:03,513
its presence.

480
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:05,382
It followed me back.

481
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,718
I was afraid something like this
would happen.

482
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:11,855
I warned you not to tempt fate.

483
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,456
Even if you're right,

484
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:14,891
why would it kill this witch?

485
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:18,361
She was a member of the coven
that banished Katrina...

486
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:20,797
that robbed the boy
of his mother.

487
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,499
There are more in the coven,

488
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,501
more who may still be alive.

489
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,838
This death, I fear,

490
00:24:28,873 --> 00:24:31,741
may be the first
of many more to come.

491
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,834
It's called a "vine,"

492
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:39,537
but it has absolutely nothing
to do with shrubbery?

493
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:41,939
Yeah, it's a video,
eight seconds long.

494
00:24:41,974 --> 00:24:43,341
On YouTube?

495
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,676
No, YouTube videos are,
like, three minutes long.

496
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:47,145
No one has time for that.

497
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,814
Yeah, I'm having a dad moment.
Thanks.

498
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:02,560
You know, when we looked into
that wheelchair sports camp

499
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:04,295
at the Y last year,
we never followed up.

500
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:05,429
I can give 'em a call.

501
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:09,066
Dad, you get this sound
in your voice,

502
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:12,603
it makes me feel
kind of helpless.

503
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,872
I'm sorry.

504
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:17,475
I mean, no matter
how scary it gets,

505
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:20,044
I'm not gonna let this thing
beat me, right?

506
00:25:20,078 --> 00:25:22,246
I'm gonna keep fighting.
Remember you said that?

507
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:24,949
Yeah, that I did.

508
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,586
And I think it'd be
easier to fight it

509
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,523
if I had some hot chocolate
with lots of marshmallows.

510
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:34,058
Oh, understandable.

511
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:39,330
Oh, my God! Popski...

512
00:25:39,364 --> 00:25:42,500
You can have a hot chocolate,
not a puppy.

513
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:46,504
Give me two hot chocolates
with peppermint.

514
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:48,906
She seems like a strong kid.

515
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:49,907
She is.

516
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:51,075
How strong is she?

517
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:52,143
Sorry?

518
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:55,079
I said, how strong
is your daughter?

519
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:59,150
Is she strong enough
to fight for her soul?

520
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,285
What did you say to me?

521
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,554
God may have a plan, Captain,

522
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:05,156
but we have one, too.

523
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,991
Who the hell are you?!

524
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:09,660
How did you know what I said?!

525
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:11,128
What the hell
are you talking about?

526
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:13,130
How did you know what I said?

527
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:14,332
I don't know! I'm sorry!

528
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,433
I don't know who the
hell you are, man.

529
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,001
Hey! What's going on here?

530
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,536
This guy just attacked me.

531
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,870
Step back, sir.

532
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:21,305
I'm New York State Police.

533
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,541
I'm reaching for my badge.

534
00:26:27,746 --> 00:26:29,780
Sorry.

535
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,484
What's wrong with you?

536
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:34,585
Let's go.

537
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,494
We have one, too.

538
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,265
The contents of the
librarian's safe have arrived.

539
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:49,367
Anything of use?

540
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,802
All the lieutenant's found
so far are ticket stubs

541
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:56,307
from traveling carnivals over
the last hundred years.

542
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:57,375
Strange.

543
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,776
Mm.

544
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:04,282
You're troubled.

545
00:27:06,985 --> 00:27:11,255
My father *** say to me,

546
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,958
"When you have a child,

547
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:18,396
he will follow your example
more than your advice."

548
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:23,200
Yet my son had
the benefit of neither.

549
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:28,039
I know that the choice
was not mine...

550
00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:32,443
but it brought his rage
into the world...

551
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:34,578
then and now.

552
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:40,918
It is a father's task
to impart wisdom.

553
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:45,523
Mine taught me
not to fear my power.

554
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:51,595
I wished I could have
thanked him for this gift

555
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,998
while his mind was still intact.

556
00:27:54,032 --> 00:27:56,334
Whatever became of your son,

557
00:27:56,368 --> 00:28:00,004
you speak for him now.

558
00:28:01,073 --> 00:28:02,440
I believe he was

559
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:04,675
a good man, Ichabod.

560
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,413
He was, after all,
molded from your clay.

561
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:15,953
Washington's Bible...

562
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,421
molded from clay.

563
00:28:18,223 --> 00:28:19,423
Katrina buried this with me.

564
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,459
She said
it would provide answers

565
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,828
for the challenges
which lay ahead.

566
00:28:25,297 --> 00:28:29,867
Psalms 139,
"And your eyes did see

567
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:31,902
my substance being
yet unformed."

568
00:28:31,937 --> 00:28:33,571
A reference in both

569
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:35,773
the Bible and the Judaic Talmud

570
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:37,041
to an enchanted being

571
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:38,709
made animate from
inanimate matter.

572
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:42,980
Like the first son of God,
born of mud.

573
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:45,716
A golem.

574
00:28:46,818 --> 00:28:48,819
I remember it
from Sunday school.

575
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:51,222
It's like a magical attack dog.

576
00:28:51,256 --> 00:28:53,290
Forceful enough to crush
Miss Hudson's vehicle

577
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:55,993
using merely its fists.

578
00:28:56,027 --> 00:29:00,431
A creature imbued with its
creator's most ardent passions.

579
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:01,665
Jeremy's doll

580
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,733
became the golem.

581
00:29:02,768 --> 00:29:06,337
Of course, he created
a protector.

582
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,142
Wait a minute.

583
00:29:11,176 --> 00:29:15,312
These four veiled women,
I've seen them before.

584
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:19,316
When I saw Katrina and the doll,
they were there, too.

585
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:21,252
"The Four Who Speak As One."

586
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:23,621
The librarian must have
visited them at different carnivals:

587
00:29:23,655 --> 00:29:27,191
Philadelphia,
New Orleans, Chicago.

588
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:30,161
These are the women who banished
Katrina to purgatory.

589
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:32,463
If the golem has been made real

590
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:35,733
and seeks revenge against those
who hurt the boy...

591
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:37,535
then surely they'll be next.

592
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:40,471
And if they put Katrina
in purgatory...

593
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:43,374
it stands to reason
they could bring her back.

594
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:45,876
And it'd strike a powerful blow
against Moloch.

595
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:48,612
We must find them
before the golem does.

596
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:51,382
The last ticket stub,
dated two days ago,

597
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:54,385
a carnival in Dobbs Ferry,
right outside town.

598
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,986
That's where they are.

599
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:07,498
Wait here.

600
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:09,233
You're not going in there alone.

601
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:10,568
These women
imprisoned my wife

602
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:13,370
and left my son abandoned
without hope.

603
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:16,407
I think I'm entitled
to a private word

604
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,309
before we take them to safety.

605
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:19,743
It seems we've been relegated

606
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,246
to the part of gongoozler,
you and I.

607
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,747
I'm not even gonna ask.

608
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,149
Gongoozler means

609
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:27,084
"idle spectator."

610
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,986
Oh, great.
That's just great.

611
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,588
You go. It's cool.

612
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,323
Henry and I will sit back here

613
00:30:32,357 --> 00:30:35,259
and gongoozle our asses off.

614
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,194
Now who's the Scrooge?

615
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:40,231
Be careful, Crane.

616
00:30:58,216 --> 00:30:59,683
Who's there?

617
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:02,453
As you so proudly boast
of your clairvoyance,

618
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,723
your query suggests you're lying
or merely playing coy.

619
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:07,024
Show yourselves.

620
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:16,200
Curious.

621
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:17,535
Your aura, it's...

622
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:19,870
Displaced, fractured...

623
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:20,871
Unreadable.

624
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:21,872
Your palm,

625
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:23,107
bring it here.

626
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,821
Your lifeline was interrupted
long ago...

627
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:38,822
Then revived.

628
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,124
There is but one mortal...

629
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:42,226
With such a curious fate.

630
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,666
You are Ichabod Crane.

631
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,101
We've waited centuries
for this moment.

632
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:52,836
It was foretold...

633
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,940
That your arrival
would seal our fate.

634
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:58,409
Seal your fate?

635
00:31:58,443 --> 00:32:00,244
I don't understand.

636
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:05,349
You will.

637
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:08,018
For tonight... we die.

638
00:32:16,085 --> 00:32:17,653
If what you're
saying is true,

639
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,021
I can take you to safety,

640
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:21,924
but only if you release Katrina.

641
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,692
If our destiny is to die...

642
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:26,762
We must accept it,
whatever form it takes.

643
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:28,096
Nothing you can offer...

644
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:29,364
Will change that.

645
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:33,628
Well, then here's some
clairvoyance for you:

646
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:35,280
Death will come for you tonight

647
00:32:35,314 --> 00:32:37,982
in the form of a creature
known as a golem.

648
00:32:38,017 --> 00:32:39,884
Accept my offer, or your demise

649
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,954
will be most painful indeed.

650
00:32:42,988 --> 00:32:44,489
The golem... has returned?

651
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:45,824
How?

652
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:47,325
It followed me back
from purgatory.

653
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,894
You found a way
between realms...

654
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:52,664
And in so doing,
repeated your wife's mistake...

655
00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:54,666
By altering the ordained path.

656
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,669
I don't believe fate befalls us
however we act.

657
00:32:57,703 --> 00:32:59,637
Only unless we act.

658
00:32:59,672 --> 00:33:01,306
Then you've learned nothing.

659
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,408
Katrina defied fate as well.

660
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:04,976
Your death would've spared her.

661
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,311
And your child.

662
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:07,979
Of all the pain they endured

663
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:09,380
after you were laid to wait.

664
00:33:09,415 --> 00:33:11,216
It was not
your decision to make!

665
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:16,187
A coven is meant
to be a source of good.

666
00:33:16,222 --> 00:33:18,556
Yet you delivered
my wife into captivity

667
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:20,058
in the hands of the enemy.

668
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:23,194
Necessity makes
strange bedfellows.

669
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:24,996
And it was our sacred duty...

670
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,332
To rectify
what Katrina had undone.

671
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:30,835
Rumors of Jeremy's
fearsome companion spread.

672
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,103
And so they were hunted.

673
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,176
The creature killed
in defense of his master.

674
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,844
A mindless thing
that murdered anyone

675
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:43,114
who came close to the boy.

676
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:44,916
When we learned
who your son was,

677
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,117
what he had created...

678
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:47,452
We offered our help.

679
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,221
But he refused beyond control.

680
00:33:50,256 --> 00:33:51,589
He chose to be alone.

681
00:33:51,624 --> 00:33:52,790
With his golem.

682
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:55,293
He was afraid.

683
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,295
The creature was
his only means of defense.

684
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:59,464
That is why they both
had to be stopped.

685
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:00,798
What did you do to him?

686
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,967
The golem could not
be destroyed by our spells.

687
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:05,637
So we imprisoned
the creature in purgatory.

688
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,071
But your son was immune to us.

689
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:08,973
His power had grown too great.

690
00:34:09,008 --> 00:34:10,375
We offered him a place

691
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,744
in our coven.
But he again refused.

692
00:34:12,778 --> 00:34:14,445
With no other choice,

693
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,147
the Sisterhood
bound together...

694
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:17,882
And invoked a hex...

695
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:20,151
To stop his heart.

696
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:32,497
You murdered my son.

697
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,232
Death begets death.

698
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:35,934
That is the price we now pay.

699
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:37,168
Our fate is sealed,

700
00:34:37,203 --> 00:34:39,571
our time run out.

701
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:46,144
How do I kill the golem?

702
00:34:46,178 --> 00:34:48,012
Your son's blood gave it life.

703
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,315
Only his blood can end it.

704
00:34:52,184 --> 00:34:53,651
Run!

705
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:58,953
- Crane!
- The Golem!

706
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,342
Where is he?

707
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:06,331
Where are the sisters?

708
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:12,704
They've met a just fate.

709
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:14,806
Did they tell you
how to stop it?

710
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,774
Only that my son's blood
gave it life,

711
00:35:16,809 --> 00:35:18,610
and only his blood can end it.

712
00:35:20,145 --> 00:35:22,013
I'm gonna get
these people out of here.

713
00:35:30,222 --> 00:35:32,156
This way.

714
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:39,063
What hellish form
of torment is this?

715
00:35:39,898 --> 00:35:41,499
Funhouse mirrors.

716
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:43,568
When did irony
become a national pastime?

717
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,280
You're hurt.

718
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:11,362
You said...

719
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:12,897
blood...

720
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:15,767
gave the doll life.

721
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:19,537
Your son's blood is your blood.

722
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:21,739
Your blood can destroy it.

723
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:29,280
Crane?

724
00:36:30,316 --> 00:36:32,150
Stop!

725
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:39,290
I'm Jeremy's father.

726
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,827
You exist because I did not.

727
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:45,463
If there was any way

728
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,765
I could go back and change this,
believe me,

729
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,968
with all my heart, I would.

730
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:55,606
But fate bestowed
this task on you.

731
00:36:55,641 --> 00:36:57,842
His only friend.

732
00:36:57,876 --> 00:37:00,912
His guardian.

733
00:37:00,946 --> 00:37:03,981
And in many ways,
a father to him.

734
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:07,685
For that, I owe you my life.

735
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:12,023
But now I'm begging you to stop.

736
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:15,893
Jeremy is gone.

737
00:37:15,928 --> 00:37:18,529
There's nothing left
for you to protect.

738
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:21,099
You have to let him go.

739
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:24,435
We both have to let him go.

740
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:01,439
You've endured enough pain.

741
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:06,344
Bear it no more.

742
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:09,080
My son.

743
00:38:10,649 --> 00:38:12,650
Be at peace.

744
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,621
Be at peace.

745
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,071
Ichabod.

746
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,942
He's gone.

747
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:45,183
It's over.

748
00:38:57,855 --> 00:39:00,015
I'm glad you're all right.

749
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:01,149
And I'm...

750
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:03,251
sorry to make a hasty exit.

751
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:04,686
But...

752
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,522
the next train leaves
in 18 minutes.

753
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:09,457
Mr. Parrish...
Oh, please.

754
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:11,927
It's Henry, remember?

755
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:14,162
And if I may, you were right.

756
00:39:14,197 --> 00:39:17,432
- About?
- I've been called to help you

757
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:18,733
in your mission.

758
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:21,236
If I hadn't separated your
blood from the Horseman,

759
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,105
you would not have been able
to put the golem to rest.

760
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:27,008
Or your son.

761
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:34,015
Thank you for availing me
of your gift.

762
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:39,354
It seems no matter
how hard we both tried,

763
00:39:39,388 --> 00:39:41,823
one cannot turn from fate.

764
00:39:41,858 --> 00:39:43,525
No.

765
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:46,595
And yet,
for the first time, I...

766
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:49,865
I feel that fate
has delivered me a blessing.

767
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,835
By bringing you both
into my life.

768
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,837
It's our privilege, Henry.

769
00:39:58,774 --> 00:40:01,843
We never bury the dead, son.

770
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:03,912
Not really.

771
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,947
We take them with us.

772
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,419
It's the price of living.

773
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:22,998
I got you something.

774
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:26,201
Oh.

775
00:40:26,235 --> 00:40:28,536
♪ Ah-ha, ha. ♪

776
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:31,907
I was gonna give it to you
on Christmas Eve, but...

777
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:33,708
you look like you
need a little boost.

778
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:38,680
Oh.

779
00:40:41,183 --> 00:40:42,450
You've em...

780
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:46,054
you embroidered my name
on some oversized hosiery.

781
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:47,856
How... odd.

782
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,191
It is a Christmas tradition.

783
00:40:50,226 --> 00:40:51,693
Is it?

784
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:54,863
Merry Christmas, Crane.

785
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:57,866
Merry Christmas, Lieutenant.

786
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:03,238
I'm starving.

787
00:41:03,272 --> 00:41:05,840
I'm gonna go get
some comfort food.

788
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,876
I'll be back in ten.

789
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:37,939
Reveal yourself!

790
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:42,310
Katrina?

791
00:41:42,345 --> 00:41:44,646
Not Katrina!

792
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,648
Come out and face me, Moloch.

793
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:50,785
Or are you afraid?

794
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,356
I offer this warning.

795
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,293
A saint's name is a sign.

796
00:41:58,327 --> 00:42:00,996
When you know my meaning,

797
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,998
war will take form.

798
00:42:03,032 --> 00:42:05,934
And the End of Days begins.

799
00:42:05,968 --> 00:42:08,670
There will be no End of Days.

800
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:10,138
You hear me?!

801
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:12,507
Your death is assured.

802
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:15,677
You and the second witness.

803
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:18,279
Face me, coward!

804
00:42:21,884 --> 00:42:25,120
I touched her soul once.

805
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:28,323
Soon it will be mine forever.

806
00:42:28,357 --> 00:42:31,326
And you will give it to me.

807
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,405
Crane?

808
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:45,473
What happened?

809
00:42:45,508 --> 00:42:48,710
Moloch.

810
00:42:48,744 --> 00:42:51,312
He's coming for your soul.

811
00:42:53,482 --> 00:42:55,216
He says I will deliver it
to him.
