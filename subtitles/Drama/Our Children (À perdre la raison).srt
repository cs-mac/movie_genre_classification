1
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,283
Our Children

1
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:33,583
You'll bury them in Morocco?

2
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,754
We'll see what we can do.

3
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,894
You'll bury them in Morocco?

4
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:59,483
You have to tell their father.

5
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:04,780
You have to tell Mounir.

6
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:09,744
You have to bury them...

7
00:02:10,494 --> 00:02:14,874
You have to bury them in Morocco.

8
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:29,673
- I have to get rid of the sand for him.
- Don't worry.

9
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:01,620
- What?
- I just...

10
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:08,544
Are you OK?

11
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:14,133
I want to marry you.

12
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:22,767
- What did you say?
- You heard.

13
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:27,854
- What did you say?
- You heard me, right?

14
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,149
No, I didn't hear.

15
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:33,819
I want to spend my life with you.

16
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:04,182
- There's no bread?
- Bread? Just a second.

17
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:10,689
After you.

18
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,984
- See you next week.
- Thank you.

19
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,945
Drive safely.

20
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:20,198
How are you lovebirds?

21
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:25,620
- Good evening, sir.
- Call me André.

22
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:28,372
I've heard a lot about you.

23
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,583
How about that?

24
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:34,211
- You've cooked?
- I asked Mounir what you'd like.

25
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:36,840
He told you I liked lasagne?

26
00:06:36,923 --> 00:06:40,259
He's too much.
Lasagne is his favourite dish.

27
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:42,261
You've got a nerve!

28
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:44,931
- You do like lasagne, though?
- You bet I do.

29
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,349
When it's made with love.

30
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,562
But I just had an urgent call.
I need to see a patient.

31
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:55,149
- So I can't...
- Can't it wait? We just...

32
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:59,445
I already had a bite to eat. I'm sorry.

33
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,989
- You won't hold it against me?
- No.

34
00:07:03,658 --> 00:07:06,702
If he's any trouble, call me.

35
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:09,747
I'm sorry.

36
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,167
Be good.

37
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:25,846
Mounir, where are the keys?

38
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,766
It's OK, I've got them.

39
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:35,104
I'm OK, it's just...

40
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,943
- We do all this and he just leaves.
- It doesn't matter.

41
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,861
Next time.

42
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:47,951
"A crocodile in the city sewers."

43
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,495
- Yes?
- I think that's non-verbal.

44
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:53,539
That's right.
And how do we modify it?

45
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:57,043
- "A crocodile is in the city sewers."
- Great, Celine.

46
00:07:57,586 --> 00:08:00,088
Now...

47
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:04,259
"There has been an earthquake
in France."

48
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:06,344
A verbal or non-verbal phrase?
Margaux?

49
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:11,516
- A verbal phrase.
- How do we make it a non-verbal one?

50
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,975
"Earthquake in France."

51
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,394
The concentration is easy.

52
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:18,189
- It's matter divided by...
- I don't care!

53
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:21,025
I don't care any more.

54
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:25,780
I'll never manage it in a week anyway.

55
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:34,288
You don't want to end up
working at the practice with me.

56
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,959
Why not? Would that bother you?

57
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:50,554
Right.

58
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:56,267
I'll do it for you.
But reread it or you'll look stupid.

59
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,001
Surely you expected it?

60
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,172
My internship report was good.

61
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:27,924
Yes, you did a good internship.

62
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:33,346
But let's face it,
the skills just aren't there.

63
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:42,521
It's no big deal.
I'm sick of it. I quit.

64
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:47,026
- I want to earn a living now.
- Be a youth worker again.

65
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:51,614
- I'm not baby-sitting all my life!
- You get on so well with kids.

66
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:55,701
- I'm sure you could do it.
- Not for such crap pay.

67
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:01,582
My offer still stands anyhow.

68
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,085
What offer?

69
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:07,254
I've needed someone
at the practice for months.

70
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:10,173
You mean...

71
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:13,260
Mounir could work with you?
Part time?

72
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,804
No. Full time.

73
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:19,642
He can start tomorrow if he wants.

74
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:23,103
That's great, isn't it?

75
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:26,482
I don't know about him,
but I'd like that.

76
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,720
I think...

77
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:42,723
- I think I want to marry her.
- Hold on, Mounir.

78
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:46,560
No, I'm serious, I swear.

79
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,651
Being in love is no reason
to marry the first girl who blows you.

80
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,739
Stop it, André.

81
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:05,871
It's not the same thing, there's...

82
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:10,291
A difference in cultures
is never easy to deal with.

83
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,628
I know. But you and I get along.

84
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,212
It's not the same.

85
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:16,881
- It is the same.
- Cut it out.

86
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:26,058
You do like her, don't you?

87
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:37,610
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

88
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:41,698
I've never seen Mounir like this.

89
00:12:47,495 --> 00:12:51,916
I know he'd never dare to ask me,
but I get the impression

90
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,002
he'd like you to live with us.

91
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:59,799
So if you want to move in,
that's fine by me.

92
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:04,678
But... Didn't he tell you?

93
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:09,099
No. What?
Mounir's pretty independent.

94
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:13,646
Besides...

95
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:16,398
It would make me happy too.

96
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:22,905
What's up?

97
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:28,869
- Am I disturbing you?
- Let us have our little secrets.

98
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:05,112
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

99
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:08,158
Just a second, André.

100
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:11,869
- We have something to tell you.
- You do?

101
00:14:13,663 --> 00:14:15,206
Shall I?

102
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,835
Alright, André,

103
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,504
we wanted to ask you

104
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:25,675
if you'd be the witness
at our wedding.

105
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:36,102
That's wonderful. Excuse me.

106
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:39,647
Congratulations. Of course.

107
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:44,651
Have you set a date?

108
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:48,322
Maybe this summer
but nothing's final yet.

109
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:49,948
Will you have a little trip?

110
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:52,660
We talked about it, but we'll wait.

111
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:55,913
- Not right away.
- Why not?

112
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:59,166
Because we need to save up for it.

113
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:04,171
That can be my wedding present,
your honeymoon trip.

114
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:08,217
- That's too much.
- Why? It's my present, period.

115
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:10,302
That's quite a present!

116
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:13,722
- Let's have a drink to celebrate.
- Yes.

117
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,141
I'll be right back.

118
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:25,316
We accept, but only if you come too.

119
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,611
Where?

120
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,487
- On our honeymoon.
- You're crazy!

121
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:31,489
Why am I crazy?

122
00:15:32,574 --> 00:15:34,201
- You're kidding.
- Not at all.

123
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:37,578
We'll only accept if you come too.

124
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,085
In that case, of course I accept.

125
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:47,422
It'll do you good too.

126
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:52,469
Here's to the two of you.

127
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,096
To your future.

128
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:58,182
To us. To everything.

129
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,560
Cheers.

130
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:50,275
Francoise.

131
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:56,031
- Francoise!
- Coming.

132
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:07,417
Well?

133
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:10,545
- Is my hair OK?
- You look fabulous!

134
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,677
It's pretty cushy here.

135
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,931
- What do you mean by that?
- Nothing.

136
00:17:22,015 --> 00:17:24,225
The doctor coughs up for it?

137
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,728
You have a real problem with that.

138
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,274
It's true.

139
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:37,238
- Can't I have a laugh any more?
- Cut it out now.

140
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,406
You're jealous, are you?

141
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,118
No one's forcing you to stay, OK?

142
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:43,744
Nice!

143
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,956
You could've told Mum, at least.

144
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:47,891
- Thank you, my daughter.
- She's thanking you.

145
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:50,351
You're beautiful. Very beautiful.

146
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:54,439
And you'll have
very beautiful children, inch'Allah!

147
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:56,983
She says you're beautiful

148
00:18:57,066 --> 00:19:00,445
and that you'll have
very beautiful children with Mounir.

149
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:04,240
She says that about me too.
Don't you, Mum?

150
00:19:04,407 --> 00:19:06,492
You say that about me too.

151
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:08,411
Of course, my daughter!

152
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,128
I'm the only one left then?

153
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,213
We'll work something out.

154
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:22,091
My neighbour is afraid.

155
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:24,718
She's hesitating
and wants more money.

156
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:27,513
- How much does she want?
- 100,000.

157
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:28,973
Can you imagine?

158
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:31,475
For three trips to the town hall.

159
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:33,018
What are you talking about?

160
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:36,063
We're looking for someone for Samir.

161
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,232
Enough! Stop talking about it!

162
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,361
Are you serious? It's easy for you.

163
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:43,612
Don't start.

164
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:46,531
Cut it out. You're brothers.
Calm down, you!

165
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:51,411
Samir wants to get married?

166
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:54,582
Yes and no. He has to find someone
to get his papers.

167
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:57,042
I was the same.

168
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,463
Without André,
I'd still be stuck back there.

169
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:04,257
- He helped you?
- Yes, we're married.

170
00:20:04,341 --> 00:20:09,846
But it's hard for Samir now
because people are more wary.

171
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,640
It makes it harder.

172
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:14,852
It's a little tougher.

173
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:18,021
For us, it's not just about the papers?

174
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:21,316
Murielle, it's not the same.

175
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,860
You two are in love.

176
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:26,362
Excuse me!

177
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:29,908
Why do you shame me like this?

178
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:33,869
- It's easy for you.
- Like I told you, be patient.

179
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,706
It's easy for you.
I'll die back in the village.

180
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,794
You and Fatima...
Poor things, you act innocent.

181
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:42,295
You don't give a damn!

182
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:47,216
When you're with the doctor,
you always show off.

183
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:48,760
Why did he take you?

184
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:50,636
I don't know. I didn't choose!

185
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,222
- Why you and not me?
- I don't know.

186
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:58,811
He married Fatima,
took you with him and left me.

187
00:20:58,894 --> 00:21:00,772
I don't exist!

188
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:03,774
Just be patient
and it'll all work out.

189
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:08,029
Besides, everyone knows.

190
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:13,533
Knows what?

191
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:16,120
People talk.

192
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:18,122
About me?

193
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:22,293
You and the doctor.

194
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:30,884
What do they say?

195
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:33,845
They never stop.

196
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:38,433
They say, "See what's happening
with that dumb doctor?"

197
00:21:38,517 --> 00:21:41,020
"He took your sister and your brother."

198
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:44,773
Don't I exist?
I'm sick of it, sick of them!

199
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:47,608
- And you believe them?
- I'm sick of the village.

200
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:51,529
Mounir, Samir, what's going on?

201
00:21:51,613 --> 00:21:54,741
- I'll tell you something...
- You're mad today!

202
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:58,036
You just have to ask for something
and he gives it to you!

203
00:21:58,161 --> 00:21:59,537
That's not the problem!

204
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,416
When he talks about you,
it's like he's talking about his woman!

205
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,626
For God's sake!

206
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:08,505
- The way you talk! Shut your mouth!
- Mounir, just go!

207
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:11,174
- Tell him to shut up!
- Samir, cut it out.

208
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:14,553
- Enough.
- Come on, let's go back.

209
00:22:27,356 --> 00:22:31,235
- My little shark!
- You're the shark.

210
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:41,137
Dr Pinget's office.

211
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:46,350
Yes, I'm just filling them out.

212
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:49,646
They'll be in this evening's mail.

213
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:54,985
With the certificates, of course.

214
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:59,613
I'll ask him to call when he gets in.

215
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,704
Very good.

216
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:09,791
Goodbye, Mr Hénard.

217
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,253
- He was moving all day.
- Moving?

218
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:19,008
- Come with me.
- I just came to give you a kiss.

219
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:28,350
Here. Come on...
Put your hand here.

220
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:31,603
- Shit!
- Did you feel that?

221
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:33,438
It's crazy!

222
00:24:34,147 --> 00:24:36,317
How's it going, sonny?

223
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:39,444
It's not necessarily a boy.

224
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:41,863
- What?
- It might not be a boy.

225
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,491
It's a boy, alright.
See how he moves?

226
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:51,039
- Feel that?
- Yes.

227
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,666
Don't mind me.

228
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:59,130
If you put it like this,
you'll hear better.

229
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,676
Well?

230
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,304
When are you seeing Lefévre again?

231
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,224
I have an ultrasound next week.

232
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:17,691
Mounir... Phone.

233
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:25,073
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

234
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,783
A little bleeding. Is that normal?

235
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:32,205
A little brownish?
Don't worry, it'll pass.

236
00:25:34,456 --> 00:25:37,251
He just moved.

237
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:42,340
- She's cute, isn't she?
- You bet.

238
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,258
Alright.

239
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:48,972
This calls for a little present.

240
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,434
Thank you.

241
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:03,736
- You like it?
- Yes! You shouldn't have.

242
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:08,365
And for your little treasure...

243
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,287
She's sleeping. I won't wake her.
Give it to her later.

244
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,460
- Look at this, baby.
- What is it?

245
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:24,506
- Look... It's her bracelet.
- That's so cute.

246
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,924
Thank you, André.

247
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:28,426
With this, her dad
won't be late for work

248
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,513
if he spends too much time with her.

249
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:38,895
- Thank you, André.
- No.

250
00:26:38,979 --> 00:26:42,106
- The same as yours!
- Don't thank me.

251
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:45,276
The best gift is her!

252
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,571
- It's beautiful.
- I'll leave you now.

253
00:26:50,365 --> 00:26:52,492
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, André.

254
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:56,705
See you tonight.

255
00:27:02,877 --> 00:27:06,923
This is a fancy one.
Seen it, sweetheart?

256
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,471
Can you put the necklace on for me?

257
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:27,359
- Can you manage?
- Lift your hair.

258
00:28:00,475 --> 00:28:04,062
Don't rock her all night,
you'll be exhausted.

259
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:07,107
- I don't know what's wrong.
- Let me try.

260
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,614
- Is this OK?
- Yes.

261
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,705
Thank you.

262
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:02,678
- Go on!
- Go on, Jade!

263
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:04,181
Head up the hill!

264
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:07,767
- Faster!
- Just a few more metres!

265
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,769
Excellent!

266
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:13,815
- Coming back?
- Go and see Mum. A kiss first.

267
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:18,153
Back to Mummy now.

268
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,369
What do you want?
Want to see the baby?

269
00:30:27,912 --> 00:30:31,582
You want to see him?
You won't see him there.

270
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:35,127
Baby?

271
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:37,380
Where is he?

272
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:40,424
- He's here. You saw him?
- Yes.

273
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:43,760
Really? Come and see!

274
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:48,932
What's he doing? Is he hiding?

275
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:53,687
Look, this is Sohane,
your little sister.

276
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:59,068
Well?

277
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:02,737
You're already jealous?

278
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:06,617
You are. It's alright.

279
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:10,453
Mummy loves you too.

280
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,789
Mummy's with Sohane now.

281
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,338
- Daddy?
- A hen.

282
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,756
- Can you give it to her?
- Sure.

283
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,718
- Let's go.
- No.

284
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,178
Yes.

285
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,312
Mummy's coming back.

286
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,277
That's so good.

287
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,656
One for Daddy.

288
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,571
Get to sleep now, girls.

289
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:33,827
Murielle!

290
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,079
Coming.

291
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,562
One always wakes the other.

292
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,655
- Wait.
- What?

293
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,575
- The girls.
- They'll go to sleep.

294
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,285
Stop it!

295
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,205
Not here!

296
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,124
Stop it, Mounir!

297
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,251
- Not here!
- Why not?

298
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:27,171
- Not in André's room.
- Who cares?

299
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,049
Stop it, OK!

300
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,303
Stop it!

301
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,723
Not in André's room!

302
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,777
Can you watch Jade?
I won't be long.

303
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:52,363
See you later, sweetheart.

304
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:54,031
Got a kiss for me?

305
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:56,658
Be good with Daddy. Bye.

306
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:58,828
See you later.

307
00:34:04,624 --> 00:34:06,627
Mummy!

308
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:28,982
What's wrong, my baby? What is it?

309
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:32,861
What happened, my love?
What have you done?

310
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:37,115
What happened?
What happened, my love?

311
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:42,787
- It's nothing.
- Go for an X-ray at the hospital.

312
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,538
Go for an X-ray right away.

313
00:34:44,622 --> 00:34:46,833
I'll look after the baby.

314
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,086
- Where are the car keys?
- On the desk, to the left, I think.

315
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:53,590
- I keep telling you to close the gate.
- I know.

316
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:57,885
For six months, I've been saying
she could have a fall!

317
00:34:57,968 --> 00:35:00,680
- I know!
- So why don't you close it?

318
00:35:00,763 --> 00:35:03,140
I'm sorry, I thought you...

319
00:35:03,224 --> 00:35:05,310
You thought what? Look at this.

320
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:07,728
Maybe she's cracked her skull!

321
00:35:09,647 --> 00:35:11,148
- Mummy?
- Yes, sweetheart?

322
00:35:11,231 --> 00:35:13,067
- Daddy?
- I'm sorry.

323
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:15,194
- Daddy?
- Yes.

324
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:18,405
Daddy's driving
to check everything's OK.

325
00:35:18,488 --> 00:35:20,950
How many steps did she fall?

326
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:23,702
About ten.

327
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:26,539
Five or six. Five or six of them.

328
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:31,168
- How many bumps did you hear?
- At least two.

329
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,632
- Has she been sick? Lost consciousness?
- No.

330
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:39,260
- How did it happen?
- Here.

331
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:41,845
Thank you.

332
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:47,351
I went out
and I forgot to close the gate.

333
00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:51,813
I should have checked.
It's all my fault.

334
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:56,193
- Oh, sweetheart!
- It happens every day.

335
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,946
It's nothing. She's fine.

336
00:35:59,488 --> 00:36:02,157
I see loads of kids
who've fallen down the stairs.

337
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,994
Even my son fell once. She's fine.

338
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,246
Just keep an eye on her.

339
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:11,165
If she's sick or loses consciousness

340
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:13,960
and is apathetic, come back.
But it should be OK.

341
00:36:14,044 --> 00:36:16,379
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome.

342
00:36:16,462 --> 00:36:17,547
Thank you.

343
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,383
Don't mention it.

344
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:23,469
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Jade.

345
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:27,015
Forgive me for blowing my top.
I'm sorry.

346
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,227
When I saw her like that...

347
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:45,616
It's nothing.

348
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,454
It's nothing.

349
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:53,082
It doesn't matter.

350
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:04,593
- Yes, Helene.
- “Michel lends his book."

351
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:07,930
"His book", direct object,
"to his neighbour", indirect.

352
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:09,765
Why? Who can tell me?

353
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,644
- Yes?
- Indirect tells us to whom or to what.

354
00:37:13,727 --> 00:37:16,521
- And the direct who and what.
- Very good.

355
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:20,401
You can do
the exercises I gave you now.

356
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:25,780
Ma'am, is your baby a girl or a boy?

357
00:37:25,864 --> 00:37:28,033
I don't know. It's a surprise.

358
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,585
It's time to sleep now, Jade.

359
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:41,671
Mummy will be back tomorrow
with your little sister.

360
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:44,924
So have a big sleep now, OK?

361
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:50,680
- Good night.
- Good night, sweetheart.

362
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:54,059
You go to sleep too now.

363
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:38,060
- You left the nightlight on?
- Yes.

364
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,948
Well, then...

365
00:38:52,782 --> 00:38:54,618
To Malika!

366
00:38:58,788 --> 00:39:00,207
What about your office?

367
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:02,251
- Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.

368
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,962
- I love the colour.
- That's your sister's.

369
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,050
Put it down.
Want to give it to her?

370
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,676
Can you put Malika down?

371
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,471
Put her with her toys.

372
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,599
Look at this!

373
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:22,395
Gently, girls. So, have you seen?

374
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:24,772
Can you put Malika down?

375
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:28,109
I'll give her the toy.

376
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:31,154
- Careful, she's sleeping.
- Careful with the baby.

377
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:32,738
Gently.

378
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:35,492
Put it under her arm.

379
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:38,202
- We'll put it here for her.
- Gently.

380
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,997
Seen this?

381
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:43,833
- You three will be fine here.
- Mummy, look.

382
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:47,253
Have you called Mum?

383
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:51,715
- You spoke to her?
- What can I tell her?

384
00:39:53,593 --> 00:39:55,303
You're not mad at me?

385
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,018
Are you managing?

386
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:04,812
I'm doing OK.

387
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:10,567
- Francoise!
- André.

388
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:13,613
It's been a while. How are you?

389
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:16,031
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd love one.

390
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,665
- You know how to live, André.
- I do.

391
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:27,960
If you want to go out one night,
call me.

392
00:40:31,546 --> 00:40:34,091
You do go out now and then?

393
00:40:34,174 --> 00:40:36,176
You don't just see my sister?

394
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,179
You have affairs?

395
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,600
You don't have any flings?

396
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,857
A man like you, if he wanted...

397
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:53,359
Excuse me.

398
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,884
- What's got into you?
- Can't we have a laugh any more?

399
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:22,639
Don't scowl like that!

400
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:44,285
Mummy, it's not working!

401
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,911
Jade.

402
00:41:45,994 --> 00:41:50,582
What are you doing? Always ask me
to put a tape in for you.

403
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:54,420
Dad'll mend it. Go and play now.

404
00:41:54,503 --> 00:41:58,507
Don't touch the video player! Stop it!

405
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,425
- Go and draw.
- It's stuck.

406
00:42:00,508 --> 00:42:03,303
I know. You could hurt yourself.

407
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,641
Off you go! Don't touch it again.

408
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:21,738
I'm coming, my baby.

409
00:42:27,536 --> 00:42:29,329
What's up?

410
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:33,749
Sohane, not on the table!

411
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:39,881
Like this.

412
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:42,092
Put another tape in!

413
00:42:43,301 --> 00:42:45,053
Can you take her?

414
00:42:55,522 --> 00:42:58,816
I don't know why
but the girls are terrible today.

415
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:05,114
I heard it was pretty busy here.

416
00:43:06,282 --> 00:43:08,660
It's got them wound up.

417
00:43:08,743 --> 00:43:12,496
Your sister turns up unannounced,
smokes in front of them...

418
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,751
If André has something to say,
he can say it to my face.

419
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:20,254
This is still his home, remember.

420
00:43:38,939 --> 00:43:41,149
I don't want your sister here again!

421
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,950
If you're exhausted, take a break.

422
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:54,537
Go to Morocco for ten days
to see your mother.

423
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:59,626
Maybe.

424
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:04,047
Murielle's really tired.
I swear, André, she's not well.

425
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,466
I can't leave her with the kids.

426
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:09,970
Murielle's tired, so what?

427
00:44:10,053 --> 00:44:14,140
Tell her your mother's sick
and you need to see her. It's not a lie.

428
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:18,228
Besides, I'll be here.

429
00:44:19,729 --> 00:44:21,898
Good night.

430
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:27,045
Look at the little fish here.

431
00:45:27,795 --> 00:45:31,800
- Those are little fish?
- Yes, of course they are.

432
00:45:31,883 --> 00:45:33,968
Don't you recognise them?

433
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:38,139
Go on, you try.
Show me how to do a little fish.

434
00:45:39,516 --> 00:45:42,686
- Is that it?
- That's the idea.

435
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:45,855
Going to try something else?

436
00:46:01,871 --> 00:46:03,790
That looks kind of like a boat.

437
00:46:03,873 --> 00:46:06,500
- Here's Mummy.
- We'll do the same again.

438
00:46:06,584 --> 00:46:09,963
We've been very good.

439
00:46:10,046 --> 00:46:12,506
- We've been good, haven't we?
- Yes.

440
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:14,216
They're not the same.

441
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,470
Mounir called.
He's staying another week.

442
00:46:17,553 --> 00:46:20,097
His mother's still not well.
He sends his love.

443
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:26,020
- What are you doing?
- I want to take my shoes off.

444
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:28,647
You've done a drawing?

445
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:34,695
- Show me.
- No, it's for Godfather.

446
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:36,781
Thank you.

447
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,741
Very beautiful.

448
00:46:41,618 --> 00:46:45,706
- I didn't sign it.
- She didn't sign it.

449
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:47,958
I didn't sign there either.

450
00:46:48,124 --> 00:46:50,711
You'll have to sign both of them then.

451
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:12,624
Look, Daddy's here.

452
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,293
How are you?

453
00:48:16,796 --> 00:48:18,547
You look well.

454
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:23,385
- What's she crying for?
- I think she's hungry.

455
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:25,387
Come on, give me a kiss.

456
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:28,932
Come here, you.

457
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,851
Come here, Sohane.

458
00:48:31,268 --> 00:48:34,813
- They've missed you.
- It doesn't look like it.

459
00:48:41,694 --> 00:48:43,363
Thanks.

460
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:02,882
- Shit!
- Look, it's broken again.

461
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:05,927
Jade.

462
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:10,390
If it's broken,
play with something else instead.

463
00:49:10,473 --> 00:49:12,975
Now let me watch the football, OK?

464
00:49:19,815 --> 00:49:23,611
- It's broken again, Daddy.
- What did I tell you?

465
00:49:23,695 --> 00:49:26,489
If it's broken, pick another toy!

466
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,118
- What's going on?
- She broke her toy.

467
00:49:30,243 --> 00:49:31,494
Why aren't they in bed?

468
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:35,622
I was seeing to Malika.
Surely you can play with your daughter.

469
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,583
Don't tell me what to do!

470
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:41,170
- Alright, girls.
- Calm down, will you?

471
00:49:41,253 --> 00:49:44,590
I got here five minutes ago
and my head's already throbbing.

472
00:49:44,674 --> 00:49:47,593
I get back and she nags me
about a pony!

473
00:49:47,676 --> 00:49:49,302
They want to play with you.

474
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:53,140
They want what?
They have plenty of toys!

475
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:15,745
It's no good, we're on top
of each other all the time.

476
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:22,126
With our two salaries, we could...

477
00:50:23,712 --> 00:50:25,755
We could find another place.

478
00:50:27,549 --> 00:50:29,217
Don't you think?

479
00:50:31,553 --> 00:50:33,346
Murielle?

480
00:50:34,138 --> 00:50:36,349
We could live in Morocco.

481
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:44,941
Why?

482
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:50,322
For them.

483
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:52,615
I don't know.

484
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:13,010
Why not?

485
00:51:13,094 --> 00:51:16,013
You're right. We need to leave.

486
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,145
We'll think of something.

487
00:51:29,985 --> 00:51:32,196
You don't fancy Morocco?

488
00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:35,365
Yes, you bet I do.

489
00:51:41,163 --> 00:51:44,083
- André, can I have a word?
- Of course.

490
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:50,088
Listen, Murielle and I
keep arguing all the time.

491
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:54,050
With the kids around,
it's not easy, you understand?

492
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:59,055
If you think this place is too small,

493
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:01,015
we'll look for somewhere else.

494
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:05,604
We were thinking it might
be worth trying to live in Morocco.

495
00:52:05,729 --> 00:52:07,897
Life is cheaper there.

496
00:52:16,197 --> 00:52:18,241
And we'd be out of your way.

497
00:52:19,534 --> 00:52:24,539
You do so much, but you don't have to.
It's getting tough with the girls.

498
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,751
You understand?

499
00:52:30,002 --> 00:52:32,922
Yes, that's great.

500
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,925
Morocco is great.

501
00:52:37,009 --> 00:52:38,803
But don't count on me

502
00:52:38,886 --> 00:52:42,097
for anything ever again, understand?
We're through.

503
00:52:42,181 --> 00:52:44,309
André, wait.

504
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:51,315
- Don't react like that.
- How should I react?

505
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,406
I bleed myself dry for you for 20 years
and this is the thanks I get?

506
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:05,162
Don't you think I might be sick of it,
that I'd like to leave too?

507
00:53:05,246 --> 00:53:08,206
That I'm sick of taking care
of you and your tribe?

508
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:14,171
You have a problem with Murielle
and you solve it by dumping me

509
00:53:14,338 --> 00:53:15,755
and then taking off!

510
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,425
I never talked about dumping you!

511
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:21,052
You're crazy to think that. Hold on.

512
00:53:21,136 --> 00:53:22,804
I didn't say that!

513
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:28,268
I have a wife and kids.
I want them to know their grandmother.

514
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:32,564
- And Morocco is my country too.
- "Morocco is my country."

515
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:35,775
What has your country done for you?

516
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,613
What has your family done for you?

517
00:53:40,697 --> 00:53:43,157
Your mother was happy
to let me take you away.

518
00:53:44,451 --> 00:53:47,996
My mother was happy but you, too,
were happy to bring me here.

519
00:53:49,997 --> 00:53:53,376
- Leave my mother out of it. Stop it.
- OK, I'll stop!

520
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:56,712
Get out, all of you. Get out of here!

521
00:53:56,796 --> 00:53:58,673
I don't need anyone.

522
00:54:22,863 --> 00:54:24,614
Are the girls asleep?

523
00:54:27,118 --> 00:54:28,869
Yes, for now.

524
00:54:42,424 --> 00:54:46,637
I've been thinking about Morocco.
Maybe it's not a good idea.

525
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,146
Think of the girls.
It won't be easy for them.

526
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:01,651
- You told him then?
- Who?

527
00:55:03,695 --> 00:55:05,322
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

528
00:55:06,323 --> 00:55:08,825
I've just been thinking.

529
00:55:08,908 --> 00:55:11,620
Besides, what'll I do there?
I won't find work.

530
00:55:11,745 --> 00:55:16,332
Of course you'll find work.
And we won't need two salaries there.

531
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:19,419
You yourself said it was better
for the girls!

532
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:26,259
The thing is, I want my own place
where I can say what I want.

533
00:55:26,343 --> 00:55:28,886
Come on, it's not so bad here.

534
00:55:30,846 --> 00:55:32,515
We don't lack anything.

535
00:55:35,268 --> 00:55:37,144
Yeah, we don't lack anything.

536
00:55:48,364 --> 00:55:50,282
I can't do that to him.

537
00:55:51,283 --> 00:55:52,827
What are you saying?

538
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,080
We can live as a family, can't we?

539
00:56:01,377 --> 00:56:04,046
You wanted space, a garden.
We'll find that.

540
00:56:06,674 --> 00:56:09,092
We'll find that? Who's we?

541
00:56:10,927 --> 00:56:14,014
- We're buying a house with him?
- No.

542
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:19,061
He's buying a house with us.

543
00:56:21,355 --> 00:56:23,648
But I'm not married to him!

544
00:56:25,108 --> 00:56:28,028
You're my children's father.
I want to live with you.

545
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:32,241
You'll live with me.
The house will be ours.

546
00:56:35,619 --> 00:56:38,162
He'll just have a room or two.

547
00:56:45,754 --> 00:56:47,797
We've always found a solution.

548
00:56:49,924 --> 00:56:51,759
We'll find one this time.

549
00:56:58,391 --> 00:57:00,018
Surely we can talk?

550
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:03,563
I'm listening.

551
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,693
- What ideas have you put in his mind?
- Nothing.

552
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:12,489
I put nothing in Mounir's mind.

553
00:57:12,572 --> 00:57:15,616
If he wants to go back to his family,
ask yourself why.

554
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,619
I'm not asking myself why,
I'm asking how.

555
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:20,955
How can he live there?

556
00:57:22,915 --> 00:57:25,125
Do you know what Morocco's like?

557
00:57:26,044 --> 00:57:28,004
Do you know how they raise girls?

558
00:57:28,963 --> 00:57:30,923
Is that what you want for them?

559
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:38,096
Their father's from Morocco
and they're Moroccan too.

560
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,850
Give me a break.

561
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:44,728
The girls were born here,
grew up here, live here.

562
00:57:44,811 --> 00:57:46,856
They don't lack anything.

563
00:57:47,815 --> 00:57:49,316
You don't either.

564
00:57:51,443 --> 00:57:54,988
- I lack time for myself.
- It's a bit late for that.

565
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:58,074
You have three kids
and now you want time too?

566
00:57:58,158 --> 00:57:59,910
Just how old are you, Murielle?

567
00:58:03,121 --> 00:58:06,667
If the apartment is too small,
we'll find somewhere bigger.

568
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:10,462
But one thing is sure.
I won't let you both screw up like that.

569
00:58:22,682 --> 00:58:26,978
Mr Pinget, André, gives this sum
to Mr Moudayeb, Mounir,

570
00:58:27,062 --> 00:58:31,607
for the acquisition and renovation
of a piece of landed property.

571
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:34,611
Mr Pinget will be your tenant

572
00:58:34,694 --> 00:58:38,823
since the sum represents
15 years' payment in advance

573
00:58:38,906 --> 00:58:43,077
for rental of part
of the said property.

574
00:58:44,495 --> 00:58:48,207
You still don't wish to include
a rescinding clause?

575
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:52,628
- No, there's no need.
- Alright, let's sign then.

576
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:57,508
- Go on.
- Initial each page.

577
00:59:04,431 --> 00:59:08,269
- And sign the last one.
- Here?

578
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:13,649
Over to you.

579
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:35,921
Look who's here.

580
00:59:36,755 --> 00:59:38,923
I'm not in quarantine any more?

581
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,760
What's wrong?

582
00:59:41,843 --> 00:59:46,432
Nothing, but I'm a bit worried.
I think my period's late.

583
00:59:46,515 --> 00:59:48,308
It is? Come and sit down.

584
01:00:03,656 --> 01:00:06,075
It's a month and a half already.

585
01:00:06,158 --> 01:00:08,161
Why didn't you say so sooner?

586
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,205
I don't know. I didn't have time.

587
01:00:12,373 --> 01:00:14,709
- Any nausea?
- Yes.

588
01:00:16,544 --> 01:00:19,547
Right... We'll do a blood test.

589
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:29,974
If this is it,
give us a boy this time.

590
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:48,576
Listen...

591
01:00:51,411 --> 01:00:54,957
I have something to say
but you may not agree.

592
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,167
Why wouldn't I agree?
What is it?

593
01:00:59,794 --> 01:01:02,840
I've wanted to say this
for a while.

594
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:06,802
But I didn't know if...

595
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:11,181
It's important.

596
01:01:11,264 --> 01:01:12,807
Go on!

597
01:01:16,395 --> 01:01:18,313
I'm pregnant.

598
01:01:31,784 --> 01:01:34,871
You thought I wouldn't agree?
Are you crazy?

599
01:01:37,332 --> 01:01:39,167
I don't know.

600
01:01:40,794 --> 01:01:43,338
Maybe you wouldn't want to keep it.

601
01:01:43,421 --> 01:01:46,048
You didn't think I'd let you
get an abortion?

602
01:01:49,135 --> 01:01:51,095
Did André mention that?

603
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:55,183
No, he just said
we needed to think it over.

604
01:01:55,266 --> 01:01:57,643
After all, it's our fourth.

605
01:01:57,727 --> 01:01:59,436
He said that?

606
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,272
No, he congratulated me.

607
01:02:01,356 --> 01:02:05,734
He was really happy.
He told me to bring you here.

608
01:02:17,538 --> 01:02:19,122
It's great.

609
01:02:21,042 --> 01:02:24,336
- You're sure?
- Yes, it's great news.

610
01:02:26,254 --> 01:02:29,466
Everything will be easier
in the new house.

611
01:02:41,562 --> 01:02:43,146
You have ten minutes.

612
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,024
- What?
- Silence!

613
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:51,488
Cut that out!

614
01:02:54,158 --> 01:02:56,660
- Need a hand, Arthur?
- No.

615
01:02:56,743 --> 01:02:58,620
- Put the book away.
- Which one?

616
01:02:59,787 --> 01:03:03,250
- Don't make fun of me. Put it away.
- Which book, ma'am?

617
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:05,418
- OK, get out!
- What did I do?

618
01:03:05,543 --> 01:03:07,336
- Take your things!
- Shit, ma'am!

619
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,757
- Watch your mouth! Just get out!
- But, ma'am...

620
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,268
Are you crazy? I pity your kid!

621
01:03:22,352 --> 01:03:24,187
- What?
- I pity your kid.

622
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:26,105
Take that back right now!

623
01:03:49,295 --> 01:03:50,921
It'll be OK.

624
01:03:52,339 --> 01:03:56,135
I'll give you a certificate
to see a therapist.

625
01:03:57,094 --> 01:04:01,057
You can go on sick leave
and be with the children.

626
01:04:01,974 --> 01:04:04,101
Mounir's going to agree with me.

627
01:04:06,812 --> 01:04:09,648
Don't let those little shits
ruin your health.

628
01:04:12,609 --> 01:04:14,194
Just take one.

629
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:30,961
I'm having anxiety attacks again.

630
01:04:32,587 --> 01:04:34,464
Especially when I'm alone.

631
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:36,800
Were you anxious before?

632
01:04:38,885 --> 01:04:40,511
Yes, a little.

633
01:04:42,222 --> 01:04:45,099
What do you think
causes this anxiety?

634
01:04:50,063 --> 01:04:51,606
I don't know.

635
01:04:56,486 --> 01:04:59,405
I'm scared of doing the wrong thing
with the girls.

636
01:05:02,617 --> 01:05:07,121
I'll put you on sick leave
and follow your doctor's treatment.

637
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:18,215
I think we need to plan
on a lengthy analysis.

638
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:21,886
An analysis?

639
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:24,680
Yes, with regular sessions.

640
01:05:24,805 --> 01:05:27,557
To think about all that.

641
01:05:27,683 --> 01:05:30,311
If you want to talk about it, that is.

642
01:05:33,605 --> 01:05:35,691
I think it would be a good idea.

643
01:05:41,822 --> 01:05:43,157
There.

644
01:05:44,158 --> 01:05:45,325
Thank you.

645
01:06:05,512 --> 01:06:07,472
This is perfect.

646
01:06:09,057 --> 01:06:12,185
It will take us through
to your maternity leave.

647
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:17,107
- She's nice anyway.
- I wanted to talk about that.

648
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:22,070
You know, De Clerck...
knows I'm your family doctor.

649
01:06:22,154 --> 01:06:25,948
It's best not to tell her
that we live together.

650
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:29,661
Just in case welfare
runs an investigation and...

651
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:31,663
It could be a problem.

652
01:06:34,582 --> 01:06:38,169
One other thing...
We could hire a cleaner.

653
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:40,129
That would help you out.

654
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:43,007
Do you want to look for someone?

655
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:04,278
What's wrong with her?

656
01:07:05,237 --> 01:07:08,825
Put your hand here.
Stay in contact with her.

657
01:07:10,409 --> 01:07:12,286
I'll get the ultrasound ready.

658
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,042
I'm here.

659
01:07:20,127 --> 01:07:21,920
It's going to be a caesarean.

660
01:07:34,974 --> 01:07:37,686
- I want to give him a kiss.
- A quick kiss?

661
01:07:39,771 --> 01:07:41,231
Gently then.

662
01:07:45,402 --> 01:07:48,362
No, don't cry, son.

663
01:07:49,448 --> 01:07:51,449
This is my son alright.

664
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:53,785
He has my eyes, huh?

665
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:56,121
He has my eyes.

666
01:08:33,616 --> 01:08:35,409
This is fun, huh?

667
01:08:46,837 --> 01:08:49,507
- Like this?
- Yes, my girl.

668
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:53,468
Well done, Murielle.

669
01:09:27,877 --> 01:09:29,420
Here you go.

670
01:09:31,214 --> 01:09:35,259
Tell me, Murielle...
ls Francoise divorced?

671
01:09:36,261 --> 01:09:39,097
- Does she still need money?
- Yes.

672
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:42,725
Do you think she'd marry Samir?

673
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:45,353
I don't know.

674
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:49,231
He can't take it here any more.
He needs papers.

675
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,236
Maybe I can ask her.

676
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:57,532
Thanks.

677
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:02,077
I've found a tiny stone.

678
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:04,705
A white one too.

679
01:10:05,873 --> 01:10:08,083
It's not a stone.

680
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:13,339
- One more, Sohane.
- I fancy a dip. Can you watch her?

681
01:11:08,976 --> 01:11:11,104
In Morocco,

682
01:11:11,187 --> 01:11:13,064
I felt really good.

683
01:11:14,023 --> 01:11:17,736
Some days,
I didn't even take my pills.

684
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,821
It was really great there.

685
01:11:21,489 --> 01:11:23,742
My sister has even agreed

686
01:11:23,825 --> 01:11:28,079
to marry Mounir's brother
so he can get his papers.

687
01:11:29,496 --> 01:11:31,958
You mean a sham marriage?

688
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:33,834
Yes.

689
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,548
A sham marriage
can be a source of stress.

690
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:40,216
No, it's...

691
01:11:40,591 --> 01:11:42,051
You know,

692
01:11:42,134 --> 01:11:46,680
Fatima, Mounir's sister,
has been married to Andre for years.

693
01:11:46,764 --> 01:11:51,602
Her name's Pinget but they don't live
together and there's never any problem.

694
01:11:54,313 --> 01:11:57,817
You mean Dr Pinget is this André
you often mention?

695
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:01,695
Dr Pinget, your family doctor?

696
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:07,367
Yes.

697
01:12:09,911 --> 01:12:12,956
You live with your family doctor?

698
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,500
No. Well, yes.

699
01:12:16,334 --> 01:12:18,295
Well, not exactly.

700
01:12:20,422 --> 01:12:23,508
I'm sorry, Murielle,
but there's a problem.

701
01:12:23,633 --> 01:12:25,010
But...

702
01:12:25,093 --> 01:12:27,262
I know you and he talk, but...

703
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:31,308
I trust him

704
01:12:31,391 --> 01:12:33,476
and we get on well.

705
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,065
I realise that, but I can't work
with a colleague who shares your life.

706
01:12:38,148 --> 01:12:42,527
I don't live with him,
he just shares our house.

707
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:44,988
Your family doctor sends you here,

708
01:12:45,071 --> 01:12:47,365
you're living with him...

709
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:51,911
...under the same roof, OK?
You go on holiday with him.

710
01:12:53,121 --> 01:12:57,667
He's your husband's adoptive father
and your sister-in-law's husband.

711
01:12:59,836 --> 01:13:04,132
And he bought the house
where he continues to live with you.

712
01:13:04,924 --> 01:13:07,051
Yes.

713
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:09,928
And he's bought a house in Morocco too.

714
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:17,269
I can't work with Dr Pinget any more.

715
01:13:18,855 --> 01:13:22,024
So we have to end my therapy?

716
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:25,695
But I need to see you.
I don't want to stop.

717
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:31,992
Don't worry,
I'm not saying we're going to stop.

718
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,037
I'm just saying I can't work
with him any more.

719
01:13:52,721 --> 01:13:54,639
- André?
- Yes.

720
01:13:54,806 --> 01:14:00,520
Actually, my shrink told me
we don't need any more sessions.

721
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:03,898
Really? Why?

722
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:12,866
It's just...
she doesn't think it's necessary.

723
01:14:13,575 --> 01:14:15,576
We've made good progress.

724
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:19,456
And she says I'm doing better.

725
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,210
That's good news.

726
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:28,464
You're going back to work?

727
01:14:31,426 --> 01:14:33,511
I don't know about that.

728
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,722
How'll we manage with the kids?

729
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:42,978
I don't know.

730
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,774
I'll do you another sick note.

731
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:49,151
Yes.

732
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:57,242
You want more eyeshade?

733
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,830
Look how beautiful Jade is.

734
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:06,168
Want some more, Sohane?

735
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:10,922
Let me see.

736
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:13,259
Some pink on your cheeks?

737
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:17,846
- Can we help you?
- No, you'll dirty yourself.

738
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:22,934
- Hold on.
- Don't get my ring dirty.

739
01:15:50,336 --> 01:15:52,297
Bravo, sweetheart.

740
01:15:57,551 --> 01:15:59,679
I'm proud of you, honey!

741
01:16:53,732 --> 01:16:57,944
- Are you OK?
- A little stomach ache.

742
01:16:58,027 --> 01:17:01,656
- You took your medicine?
- No, I forgot.

743
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,283
Hold on, I have some.

744
01:17:08,788 --> 01:17:12,334
You realise what the children feel,
seeing you like this?

745
01:17:15,128 --> 01:17:17,797
Take that and we'll wait for you
in the car.

746
01:17:33,104 --> 01:17:37,441
With the treatment,
it'll soon pass. Drive safely.

747
01:17:37,525 --> 01:17:39,611
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

748
01:17:39,694 --> 01:17:41,195
See you soon.

749
01:17:52,165 --> 01:17:54,667
Can I have a quick word?

750
01:18:04,259 --> 01:18:08,722
I've done the transfer
but go easy with the account.

751
01:18:08,847 --> 01:18:10,641
Sure.

752
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:12,810
Why say that? I'm careful.

753
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:16,855
I don't know.
Tell her to be careful too.

754
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:18,941
I'm not made of money, OK?

755
01:18:45,717 --> 01:18:48,428
- Girls, we're home!
- Shit!

756
01:18:49,346 --> 01:18:51,222
Shit!

757
01:18:52,891 --> 01:18:55,685
Did you do anything nice today?

758
01:18:57,562 --> 01:19:00,440
- What did you do?
- How are my princesses?

759
01:19:02,609 --> 01:19:04,318
- Where's Mum?
- She's asleep.

760
01:19:04,402 --> 01:19:05,904
I'm here.

761
01:19:05,987 --> 01:19:09,407
I fell asleep. Dinner isn't ready.

762
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:11,409
And you left them all alone?

763
01:19:13,244 --> 01:19:16,497
I'll get some pizzas.

764
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:19,208
Does pizza suit everybody?

765
01:19:19,292 --> 01:19:20,793
Shall we buy pizzas?

766
01:19:20,877 --> 01:19:23,879
- Leave it, André, I'll go.
- It's OK.

767
01:19:23,963 --> 01:19:27,425
- Come on, girls, before they close.
- Here's your card.

768
01:19:30,302 --> 01:19:33,222
Thank you. Come on, hurry!

769
01:19:40,104 --> 01:19:42,106
What were you doing with his card?

770
01:19:42,189 --> 01:19:45,567
Doesn't he give us enough money?
How does that make me look?

771
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:49,988
- I'm sorry I fell asleep. I was tired.
- Don't tell me you're sorry!

772
01:19:50,072 --> 01:19:54,118
He pays for everything
and now he has to buy dinner too?

773
01:19:54,201 --> 01:19:55,619
You could've gone.

774
01:20:03,502 --> 01:20:05,378
You're pissing us off!

775
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,425
He doesn't have to do all this!
Show him some respect!

776
01:20:14,346 --> 01:20:16,389
It's just a fly.

777
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:20,519
- It was a fly.
- A fly's nothing.

778
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:23,021
What are you doing?

779
01:20:23,104 --> 01:20:27,150
If there are bees in the house,
they sting, so don't touch them.

780
01:20:28,235 --> 01:20:29,986
There are no bees.

781
01:20:31,529 --> 01:20:33,365
That's too much.

782
01:20:34,241 --> 01:20:36,075
It's too much.

783
01:20:42,874 --> 01:20:47,379
The contracting parties deposited
their wedding contract on May 22, 2005,

784
01:20:47,462 --> 01:20:49,422
with Mr Rémy, a notary in Brussels.

785
01:20:49,505 --> 01:20:52,341
The contract foresees
division of property.

786
01:20:53,008 --> 01:20:56,304
Witnessed by Mounir Moudayeb,
brother of the groom,

787
01:20:56,387 --> 01:20:59,181
aged 26, resident of Brussels,
and Murielle Moudayeb,

788
01:20:59,264 --> 01:21:02,476
sister of the bride, aged 27,
resident of Brussels.

789
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,604
This marriage act was drawn up
in their presence

790
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:09,025
and signed
by the couple and their witnesses.

791
01:21:09,108 --> 01:21:12,861
By the powers vested in me,
I declare you husband and wife.

792
01:21:12,945 --> 01:21:14,697
You may kiss.

793
01:21:31,546 --> 01:21:35,134
Praise God, I'm happy for my children.

794
01:21:35,217 --> 01:21:39,137
I'll never forget
what the doctor has done.

795
01:21:39,262 --> 01:21:43,308
She says she's proud
of her children and her grandchildren

796
01:21:43,392 --> 01:21:47,146
and will never forget
what the doctor has done for us.

797
01:21:47,229 --> 01:21:51,483
You're a good mother.
May God preserve you.

798
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:55,320
She says you're a great mother.

799
01:21:55,404 --> 01:21:58,698
Here. A present for you.

800
01:22:01,493 --> 01:22:03,286
Try it on.

801
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:05,872
You have to try it on.

802
01:22:06,372 --> 01:22:07,833
Thank you.

803
01:23:14,148 --> 01:23:16,150
André!

804
01:23:23,407 --> 01:23:26,618
- What's wrong?
- She fell.

805
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:29,955
I want to go home.
I don't know what's wrong.

806
01:23:30,038 --> 01:23:33,583
- I can't breathe.
- What was that?

807
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:37,629
- She wants to go home. She's in pain.
- Where?

808
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:41,425
- Where does it hurt, Mum?
- I don't know.

809
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,177
I was alone in the bathroom.

810
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:47,806
I thought I was dying.

811
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:50,767
- I saw my own death.
- She was in the bathroom.

812
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:53,352
She says she saw death.

813
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:56,648
She wants to go home.

814
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:59,608
- Lie her down. I have to examine her.
- She can't get up.

815
01:23:59,692 --> 01:24:03,237
- Help me, my son, please.
- Come on.

816
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:08,409
We'll go home tomorrow.

817
01:24:40,065 --> 01:24:42,359
Take care.

818
01:24:49,992 --> 01:24:54,580
You take care.
Try to rest, my daughter.

819
01:24:54,663 --> 01:24:58,041
- She can't understand, Mum.
- Look after the children.

820
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:01,628
May God protect you, my daughter.

821
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,145
- You gave her the medicine?
- Yes.

822
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:20,688
You're sure?

823
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:10,112
<i>So difficult at times</i>

824
01:26:12,281 --> 01:26:16,660
<i>When every single wound</i>

825
01:26:19,371 --> 01:26:23,917
<i>Seems to last forever</i>

826
01:26:26,086 --> 01:26:30,674
<i>Seems to last forever</i>

827
01:26:30,924 --> 01:26:37,514
<i>Women, I love you</i>

828
01:26:38,056 --> 01:26:44,104
<i>Women, I love you</i>

829
01:26:45,355 --> 01:26:50,986
<i>I know no simple ones</i>

830
01:26:52,278 --> 01:26:58,159
<i>I only know fragile ones</i>

831
01:26:59,786 --> 01:27:04,707
<i>And difficult ones</i>

832
01:27:06,626 --> 01:27:11,297
<i>Yes, difficult ones</i>

833
01:27:16,302 --> 01:27:20,598
<i>Sometimes so funny</i>

834
01:27:22,809 --> 01:27:27,312
<i>With a look over the shoulder</i>

835
01:27:30,316 --> 01:27:34,027
<i>Yes, but so funny</i>

836
01:27:36,572 --> 01:27:41,076
<i>With a sidelong glance...</i>

837
01:30:41,795 --> 01:30:44,423
Come on, girls, it's time!

838
01:30:44,757 --> 01:30:48,135
When will Granny be better?

839
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:51,639
- What?
- When will Granny be better?

840
01:30:51,764 --> 01:30:55,308
You know,
when people get very, very old,

841
01:30:55,392 --> 01:30:57,436
they're much more fragile.

842
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,189
But with the good Moroccan air...

843
01:31:01,273 --> 01:31:03,317
Come on, let's go, girls.

844
01:31:04,235 --> 01:31:06,862
You should change, you look ridiculous.

845
01:31:40,353 --> 01:31:44,316
Hello, Dr De Clerck.
It's Murielle.

846
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:46,276
Murielle Moudayeb.

847
01:31:46,776 --> 01:31:48,361
<i>I...</i>

848
01:31:49,487 --> 01:31:52,490
I'm sorry, it's a bit early.

849
01:31:53,116 --> 01:31:55,534
I wanted to talk to you...

850
01:31:59,497 --> 01:32:01,999
These last few weeks...

851
01:32:03,585 --> 01:32:05,670
...I haven't been doing so well.

852
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:10,425
I have gloomy thoughts.

853
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:15,679
I imagine things...

854
01:32:17,098 --> 01:32:19,141
And I...

855
01:32:21,393 --> 01:32:24,939
I'm scared for the children.

856
01:32:26,273 --> 01:32:28,317
I'm not very well.

857
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,903
I'm tired.

858
01:32:31,654 --> 01:32:34,406
And I can't see a way out.

859
01:32:35,657 --> 01:32:40,871
I feel... walled up here.

860
01:32:43,415 --> 01:32:45,042
Mounir is away.

861
01:32:47,002 --> 01:32:51,298
I don't even know
if I should tell Mounir about it.

862
01:32:52,549 --> 01:32:54,926
And then there's Pinget.

863
01:32:57,304 --> 01:32:59,097
And the children.

864
01:33:02,558 --> 01:33:07,355
I'm sorry to take up your time, doctor.

865
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,902
If you want,
you can call me at home.

866
01:33:41,263 --> 01:33:45,268
Godfather, does it hurt
when you have a verruca removed?

867
01:33:45,351 --> 01:33:47,269
No, it doesn't.

868
01:33:47,353 --> 01:33:51,649
What can really hurt, though,
is if you don't have it removed.

869
01:33:51,732 --> 01:33:54,860
- You're sure?
- Yes. Don't worry about it.

870
01:33:56,778 --> 01:33:58,948
I'll be there with you, sweetheart.

871
01:34:28,435 --> 01:34:30,729
Stay near her. Please.

872
01:34:31,146 --> 01:34:35,442
Let me work, madam, please.
Take her hand.

873
01:34:35,525 --> 01:34:37,611
There, like that.

874
01:34:38,904 --> 01:34:41,865
You'll see. You'll hardly feel a thing.

875
01:34:42,573 --> 01:34:44,326
Count to three.

876
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:46,911
One...

877
01:34:48,288 --> 01:34:49,997
Two...

878
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:55,545
Madam?

879
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:57,964
Sit down.

880
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:01,300
- You're having a dizzy turn.
- I'm OK.

881
01:35:03,177 --> 01:35:04,429
Come and sit down.

882
01:35:04,512 --> 01:35:07,682
- Come on.
- I'm OK.

883
01:35:13,229 --> 01:35:14,480
Jade“.

884
01:35:15,272 --> 01:35:18,818
- Are you OK? It didn't hurt?
- Are you OK too?

885
01:35:18,901 --> 01:35:20,986
I'm OK, sweetheart.

886
01:35:21,821 --> 01:35:25,658
Jade, your mummy just felt dizzy.
It's nothing serious.

887
01:35:52,726 --> 01:35:56,938
Murielle, can I have a word? Sit down.

888
01:35:57,022 --> 01:35:59,942
- I'm going to fetch the children.
- Sit down!

889
01:36:11,328 --> 01:36:13,538
Do you know who called me earlier?

890
01:36:15,248 --> 01:36:16,749
No, I don't.

891
01:36:16,833 --> 01:36:18,460
You don't?

892
01:36:19,753 --> 01:36:21,212
Why are you lying?

893
01:36:23,297 --> 01:36:26,509
Why didn't you say
you were still seeing De Clerck?

894
01:36:28,469 --> 01:36:30,680
I didn't lie.

895
01:36:30,763 --> 01:36:34,142
She told me it had to stay between us.

896
01:36:34,225 --> 01:36:35,768
It's her fault then?

897
01:36:39,564 --> 01:36:41,399
What are you doing, Murielle?

898
01:36:44,693 --> 01:36:45,945
Why are you lying?

899
01:36:47,238 --> 01:36:48,781
I'm not lying.

900
01:36:50,699 --> 01:36:52,702
Who do you think you are?

901
01:36:54,787 --> 01:36:56,789
What have we done to you?

902
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:02,253
- Nothing.
- What have we done?

903
01:37:04,504 --> 01:37:05,965
Nothing.

904
01:37:10,218 --> 01:37:12,513
I'll go and fetch the children.

905
01:38:55,864 --> 01:38:57,365
Hello.

906
01:39:07,334 --> 01:39:09,002
Will that be all?

907
01:39:11,046 --> 01:39:14,216
That's 38 euros 60, please.

908
01:39:17,052 --> 01:39:18,761
Thank you.

909
01:39:22,098 --> 01:39:23,725
Here you go.

910
01:39:29,064 --> 01:39:31,023
I want strawberry.

911
01:39:32,734 --> 01:39:37,071
- That one's my cake.
- There.

912
01:39:37,155 --> 01:39:39,616
Want some, Malika?

913
01:39:39,699 --> 01:39:42,243
Can the rabbit have some?

914
01:39:45,287 --> 01:39:49,917
The rabbit can have some cake too.

915
01:41:34,896 --> 01:41:37,648
Malika, honey, come here.

916
01:41:40,151 --> 01:41:42,069
Malika.

917
01:41:42,153 --> 01:41:44,071
Come here, sweetheart.

918
01:41:54,206 --> 01:41:56,000
Come on.

919
01:42:18,438 --> 01:42:20,232
Sohane!

920
01:42:21,191 --> 01:42:23,610
Come on, sweetheart.

921
01:42:29,324 --> 01:42:31,159
I'm coming.

922
01:42:40,168 --> 01:42:42,170
Jade, honey?

923
01:43:35,347 --> 01:43:38,141
I've done something really bad.

924
01:43:39,476 --> 01:43:41,604
I've killed my children.

925
01:43:42,688 --> 01:43:46,399
I wanted to kill myself, but I can't.

926
01:43:47,067 --> 01:43:49,194
But I want to die!

927
01:43:51,029 --> 01:43:52,697
Yes...

928
01:43:54,325 --> 01:43:56,201
My four children.

929
01:44:00,664 --> 01:44:02,332
18...

930
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:05,502
...Rue des Vosges...

931
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:35,502
