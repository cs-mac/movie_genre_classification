1
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,128
Why are you laughing?

2
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:31,428
- I'm not laughing, just...
- No.

3
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:32,728
- But last time I thought...
- No.

4
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:36,829
You told me it would cost $200.

5
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,429
I'll give you a thousand
to take me there on October 20th.

6
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:43,529
But last time I was talking shit
because I thought you were talking shit.

7
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:45,629
I'm sorry, sir.
I apologize for my language.

8
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,029
Sorry about that.
I really never checked out the price.

9
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:49,830
I even forgot...

10
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,730
Yo, what up, player?

11
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,030
Yeah, I'm just chillin' here, man.

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,530
North Side in an hour.

13
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,530
I got you.

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,930
Yo, big dawg,
let me call you back, all right?

15
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,330
I'll call you right back. Peace.

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,331
So you're serious?

17
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:10,631
It's my birthday today, man.

18
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:12,031
- What?
- It's got to be my birthday.

19
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,631
A thousand dollars?
That's a lot of money.

20
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:17,031
I don't give a shit if it's your birthday.
Can you do it or not?

21
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:18,932
You said Blowing Rock, right?

22
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:20,632
You want me to take you
two hours from here

23
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:22,432
on top of some mountain where
you're not meeting nobody,

24
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,732
and you don't want to come back.

25
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:25,732
- That's what you said, right?
- I told you all this before.

26
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:28,832
I don't want to repeat myself to you
and every cabbie in Winston-Salem.

27
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:30,632
Yeah, but, big dawg,
this is kind of strange.

28
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,732
You got to give me that, right?

29
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:33,833
You know?

30
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,033
You want to talk about something?

31
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:36,833
Forget it.
I'll call and get another driver.

32
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,233
- No, big dawg, no...
- Forget it.

33
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,933
I'm your driver. Come on.
I'm your driver, man.

34
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,633
Don't call the other drivers.
They're not good.

35
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,433
I'll telling you, they're not good.
Don't call them.

36
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,533
You know? Just that...

37
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,133
What are you going to do there, anyway?

38
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,634
Are you going to go camping?

39
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,734
Are you going there to chill
with the trees and the birds?

40
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,234
You like birds, big dawg?

41
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:57,734
Are you going to fly away?

42
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:00,634
You're not going to jump, right?

43
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:10,535
You're not going to do that.

44
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:12,135
Tomorrow's going to be
a better day, you know?

45
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:15,435
- You're just going to the movie now...
- How about a hundred-dollar deposit?

46
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:20,236
The rest also in cash on October 20th
when you pick me up.

47
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:26,836
That's fine. That's cool.

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,640
Yo, big dawg!

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,440
Yo, William!

50
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:32,741
That's my cell phone, all right?
Call me on this one.

51
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:35,141
Don't call the dispatch anymore.
It's for my preferred client, okay?

52
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:36,941
Have a good night.

53
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:05,343
64-64. Dropped at
Marketplace Cinemas.

54
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:09,943
All right. Call me on Bobworth,
off of South Main Street.

55
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,343
All right. 6-4 out.

56
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:31,749
What's up, Ken?

57
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:36,749
You want a cab?

58
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:40,950
- All right. Thank you, ma'am.
- Morning, Pork Chop.

59
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,550
- Good morning, Solo.
- How are you doing?

60
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,050
- Fine. And you?
- I'm chillin'.

61
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,650
Listen. Remember the trip
you gave me yesterday

62
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,250
from the Crystal Towers Apartment
to the movie?

63
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,550
If this guy calls again,
please give me that trip, all right?

64
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,151
How am I supposed to know who's calling?

65
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,851
His name is William.
You know, just ask.

66
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:58,951
I can't do it, and you know I can't.

67
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:01,451
- Come on, Cab 1.
- Come on, Pork Chop.

68
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,351
You know I'm not supposed
to give out trips like that.

69
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,251
A beautiful girl like you,
you can do whatever you want.

70
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:07,151
You're rocking this place, you know?

71
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,752
Cab 1, give 1641 B.

72
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:10,852
He's just a friend.

73
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:13,052
- You know what I'm saying?
- 1641 B, Lincoln.

74
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:15,852
Listen, when are we going to have
our steak at O'Charley's?

75
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:18,152
- Steak at O'Charley's?
- And a Tom Collins.

76
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,652
- Tom Collins?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,553
Yo, Mamadou, thank you.

78
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:32,953
All right.

79
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:34,653
So you need a ride for the next trip?

80
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:36,253
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- All right.

81
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:56,255
Morning.

82
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,355
Solo, don't get in our bed
until you take a shower.

83
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:00,355
And your breakfast is in the fridge.

84
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:05,055
Bonjour again.

85
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:06,856
Bonjour again, Solo.

86
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:09,356
"Captain Abisha Slade had a slave...

87
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:10,756
"his name was Stephen...

88
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:14,456
"who produced the first
bright leaf tobacco in 1839

89
00:07:14,556 --> 00:07:17,256
in Caswell County."

90
00:07:17,256 --> 00:07:19,856
That's right here.

91
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:24,557
"The farmer needed sandy soil,

92
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:27,057
and the Appalachian Piedmont has it."

93
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:28,957
- That's here.
- Bijou, can I see this, actually?

94
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,457
No. What about my cell phone?

95
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:32,057
You know what your mom said.

96
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,858
- Bye.
- You smell like smoke.

97
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,360
Cab number 7, Cab 7.

98
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,261
22922.

99
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:37,362
Hey, William, I thought
you were going to the movies.

100
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:39,262
- I am, and be careful with my stuff.
- With your luggages?

101
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:41,462
- What's going on?
- I sold my apartment.

102
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,162
You sold your apartment?
What for?

103
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:45,262
Moving into a motel.

104
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,562
I mean, is that all you have?
Where's your stuff?

105
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:49,263
Don't start your shit with me again.

106
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,763
Let's go.
I don't want to be late.

107
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:53,563
All right, big dawg.

108
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:00,363
I don't get it, man.

109
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:03,464
Isn't it better to go to a motel first,
drop off your luggages?

110
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:05,264
Why am I with you again?

111
00:09:05,364 --> 00:09:07,464
How come it's always you
that picks me up?

112
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:09,864
Because I'm your driver now.
You know what I'm saying?

113
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:13,264
And anyway, I have this
I want to give back to you.

114
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:14,964
- What's this?
- Come on, man.

115
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:17,065
Last time you were just upset,
so I saved it for you.

116
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,265
Are you stupid?

117
00:09:18,365 --> 00:09:20,165
Or you just don't understand English?

118
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:23,365
We have a deal.
Would you just drive?

119
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,965
All right. Okay.
Then you know what?

120
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,865
Could you please call me
on my cell phone from now on?

121
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,566
Because when you call the dispatch,
it's always a problem over there.

122
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:35,266
I don't really give a shit which one
of you people picks me up.

123
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,266
That's not really nice.
We're friends now.

124
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,866
I think I want to know why you want
to go out to that mountain.

125
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,266
Do you ask all your passengers
why they want to go places?

126
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,066
Of course. Sometimes I do.

127
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,567
And when they're fine ladies,
I ask even more, man.

128
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,167
Especially when they have big booties.

129
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:51,467
You like big booties?

130
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,867
I pick up a lot of big booties
here in this cab.

131
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:57,367
You like black women?

132
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,667
I know this black woman, right?

133
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,568
She's shaped like a bottle of soda.

134
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,568
I can hook you up.

135
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:08,668
William, you have family here, right?

136
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:10,468
Why don't you move in with them?

137
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:17,269
Why family don't stay together in America?

138
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:19,469
If that was in Senegal...

139
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:20,869
That's where I'm from.
In Africa.

140
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:22,669
You know where it is, right?

141
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:24,469
Dakar.

142
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:26,369
Family stay together.

143
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:29,170
We take care of our parents, old people.

144
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,070
Even if they don't have teeth
in their mouths anymore,

145
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,270
we take food and we put it
in their mouths.

146
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,970
Then why aren't you there now?

147
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,170
I got to make money
and send it back home, that's all.

148
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,470
You know what I mean?
I'm going to go there when I get old.

149
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,270
They're going to take care of me.
Same thing your people can do for you.

150
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,771
Who said I want to see my people?

151
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,071
Of course you want to see them.
They're your blood.

152
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:49,571
And I'm sure they want to see you.

153
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:11,872
Hi. Can I help you?

154
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,673
No, thank you.

155
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,373
Okay.

156
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:42,175
Hey! Hey, Solo!

157
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:44,875
Hey, William.

158
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,275
What's going on, man?

159
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:48,975
Because of your bullshit we're late.
The movie already started.

160
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,475
You sure you don't want
to see another movie?

161
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,275
I can keep your bags
and come back and get you.

162
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,275
That's not a problem.

163
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,375
Oh, forget it.
Let's find a motel.

164
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:57,276
Okay, but we got to go
pick up someone first.

165
00:11:57,276 --> 00:12:00,076
It's not going to be long.
Are you cool?

166
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:01,576
All right.

167
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:09,876
William, I'm going
to Piedmont Circle Projects.

168
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:12,577
I mean, I'm talking about Homicide Circle.

169
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,477
I don't give a shit.

170
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:16,677
All right, big dawg.
Let's go, then.

171
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,278
- Solo. Yo, who this, man?
- Yo, I'm sorry, man.

172
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:38,878
He's a good friend of mine.
Come on in.

173
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:40,579
Look, you can't be having people
riding with you.

174
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,379
I'm sorry. It's cool, though.
Come on in.

175
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,779
Old timer, slide over, bro.

176
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,879
Chill out, man.
That's my homey William.

177
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,079
Man got to have somewhere to sit.
Know what I mean?

178
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,579
- Damn.
- William, this is Roc.

179
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,079
- What up, player?
- Chillin', man.

180
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,379
All right.

181
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:18,981
Solo, turn right on Broad for me.

182
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,681
- I got you, bro.
- Good look.

183
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:29,182
Don't leave, man.

184
00:13:29,282 --> 00:13:30,582
I got you, man.
I'll be around.

185
00:13:30,682 --> 00:13:33,182
- Give me the wait time if you got to.
- All right.

186
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:39,883
He's not going to be long, all right?

187
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:41,883
Just a couple more stops
and back to his place.

188
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:44,583
You know what I'm saying?
One of my preferred clients.

189
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,784
Big dawg, I got to go take a pee.

190
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:57,484
You know what I'm saying?
Are you all right?

191
00:13:57,484 --> 00:13:58,784
You okay?

192
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,584
I'll be right back.

193
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:22,586
Cab 6-4. 6-4.

194
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:28,386
Solo.

195
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:34,586
Come on, Solo, wake up!

196
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:46,587
- Yo, let's go!
- What's going on?

197
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:47,787
Hey, where's Solo at?

198
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,487
- Pissing.
- Aw, sh...

199
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:51,188
Solo, come on.
Let's go, dawg!

200
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,388
- We got to hurry up!
- Oh, shit.

201
00:14:52,488 --> 00:14:53,688
- Come on!
- What's going on?

202
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:56,088
They tripping, dawg.
We got to get up out of here.

203
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:57,788
Come back here!
Get the fuck back here!

204
00:14:57,888 --> 00:14:58,888
- What happened?
- Solo, let's go!

205
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:01,388
Get me the fuck out of here!
Get me out of here!

206
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:02,888
Drive, man, drive!

207
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:04,388
- Damn!
- Shit!

208
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:05,889
Roc, what's going on?
Why they tripping?

209
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:09,089
- I told you I got the wait time on.
- William, you all right?

210
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:18,089
Hey, Navani! Navani!

211
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:19,790
Did he tell you why he left Winston?

212
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,790
No. He just said it was 30 years ago.

213
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,690
That's it?
No friends, no family?

214
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,990
I already told you,
he didn't say anything else.

215
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,090
He seems cool.
I think he's fine.

216
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,190
Listen. Offer him a round on me, okay?

217
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,790
Okay, babe.

218
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,391
Solo, when you finally
going to get that cab fixed?

219
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,491
I got you.

220
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,191
I'm just waiting for this part, you know?

221
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,091
Listen, man. I told you.

222
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:41,391
I got a connect in Maryland.

223
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:45,891
This girl done told him she got
a 725 on the credit score.

224
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:48,492
Says she can get us 20 Gs
for these cabs now.

225
00:15:48,592 --> 00:15:52,292
I need you to put the drivers
in the car for me.

226
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:53,992
We could have this fire all around the town.

227
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:56,992
Have the whole city smoking good, cuz.

228
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:59,792
- I got a major supply coming in right now.
- It's from Solo.

229
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,493
Cheers, William!

230
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:08,793
Solo, are you hearing me?

231
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:10,293
Yo, man!

232
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:12,293
You paying me any attention, cuz?

233
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:15,193
I need you to get that cab fixed
so we can get this deal going on.

234
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:16,993
I got you, player.
I got you.

235
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,294
You know what?
Let's keep playing.

236
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,094
I need to get my $20 back anyway.

237
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:21,994
All right.

238
00:16:21,994 --> 00:16:23,394
Check this out.

239
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:25,194
That's what I'm talking about.
What you got?

240
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:26,294
I'm going to hit me another.

241
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:28,394
All right, we'll see.

242
00:16:28,494 --> 00:16:31,194
That's the first one you done hit all day.

243
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,097
William.

244
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:07,397
Come on, we're here.

245
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:10,797
Where?

246
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,097
At my place.

247
00:17:13,197 --> 00:17:14,997
What are we doing here?

248
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:18,498
Big dawg, I couldn't
find a motel on the way here.

249
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:19,798
Why didn't you wake me up?

250
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:22,098
I tried, but you wouldn't wake up.

251
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:23,698
You drank too much.

252
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:27,098
Big dawg, it's not a problem.

253
00:17:27,098 --> 00:17:29,198
You got drunk, but we had
a good time, right?

254
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,099
I get drunk all the time.
You know what I'm saying?

255
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,099
Plus, we're already here, man.

256
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,399
Come on, let's go. All right?

257
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,599
I'll find you a nice motel tomorrow,
I promise.

258
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,999
All right?
Let's go, big dawg.

259
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,299
I got you.
You know what I'm saying?

260
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:40,499
I'll get you a nice motel tomorrow.

261
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,900
No, don't worry about that.
Don't worry.

262
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,300
I got it, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

263
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,001
William, this is my wife's place.

264
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,401
- All right?
- Navani?

265
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,501
No. Navani's my ex.

266
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:03,201
She doesn't exist here.

267
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:06,201
My wife's name is Quiera, okay?

268
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,201
William, my wife's name is Quiera.

269
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:10,301
All right!
Keep your dick in your pants.

270
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:14,102
Okay. You know,
just making sure, that's all.

271
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,202
She's pregnant now,
and, you know,

272
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,402
she gets, um...
she gets very sensitive.

273
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:18,802
You know what I mean?

274
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:21,902
This is Machu Picchu.

275
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:24,902
The Inca people, they built it
about 500 years ago.

276
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:26,302
Yeah, I know about it.

277
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:28,003
Really? Wow.

278
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:31,003
I can't believe they did it
with their hands only.

279
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:32,603
You been?

280
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:34,303
No, but I would love to.

281
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:36,903
I hear it's even hard
to breathe over there.

282
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:38,303
There you go.
This is yours.

283
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:41,303
The bathroom's right here.
You need anything else?

284
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:43,404
Do you want a glass of water, anything?

285
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:45,104
No? Okay.

286
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:46,704
Have a good night, William.

287
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:48,304
See you tomorrow morning.

288
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:20,606
Solo, wake up.

289
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:24,806
Solo, wake up.

290
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:26,107
Wake up, Solo.

291
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:29,407
Bonjour, Solo.

292
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:34,007
Mom wants to talk to you.

293
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:42,508
What's up, baby?
You want to talk to me?

294
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,108
- Why you lying to me?
- What's going on?

295
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,908
"Dear Mr. Souléymane Diop,

296
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,708
"your request for a flight attendant
interview with Sun Airlines

297
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,508
has been processed and approved
for October 15, 2007."

298
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,309
- Baby, is this letter you're upset about?
- Solo, this is next week!

299
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:58,009
Yeah, but this letter is three months old.
I just didn't throw it away.

300
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:01,909
But you promised me to give up
this childish dream, remember?

301
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,309
Baby, it's not childish.

302
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,209
Why you got to say that all the time?
It's better than driving a taxi.

303
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,009
Plus, you know I don't
even want to do that anymore.

304
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,910
It doesn't matter what you want to do.

305
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,510
We agreed that it was best for the family

306
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,610
if you drive in the day
so you could be with us.

307
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,110
Seriously, I did not study.
I gave it up.

308
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,110
Who's going to help me
take care of this baby

309
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,710
when you're flying
to Florida or New York

310
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,710
for three or four days?

311
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,310
- Baby, I'm here.
- I need you here!

312
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,910
That's what I'm saying.
I'm here. I didn't study.

313
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,311
And I'm sick of that taxi!

314
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:26,511
I'm going to call my cousins
to come here and fix it.

315
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,611
No, baby. You know I don't want
your cousins in my business.

316
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,611
- Well, fix it!
- I will do it. I'm waiting for...

317
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:33,311
And who the hell is that old man
sitting in my sofa, huh?

318
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:35,511
- Tell me!
- That's my friend William.

319
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,112
I don't want your friend William
in my house, okay?

320
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,112
Quiera...

321
00:20:40,212 --> 00:20:41,312
Quiera, that's not really nice.

322
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,412
I'm sorry, William.

323
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:50,312
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Do you want...

324
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:00,313
Why you don't let my cousins to help?

325
00:21:00,413 --> 00:21:02,713
- They want to, Solo.
- I don't want your cousins in my business.

326
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:04,413
- You know that already.
- You don't do anything.

327
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,513
All you do is hanging out
with your friends.

328
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,114
Baby, calm down.
It's okay.

329
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,615
I had this one, like, for a month.

330
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,115
A week after, it was broken.
I don't even want it.

331
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:29,415
I don't want to drive a cab.
I've been doing that for three years!

332
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:31,515
I had given up my flight attendant thing.

333
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:34,115
She goes through my stuff,
and she doesn't want to believe me.

334
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:39,016
You have any unsalted butter
and mushrooms?

335
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:40,616
I want to make an omelet.

336
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,016
William, did you check in the kitchen?

337
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:43,716
Check in the kitchen.
Take whatever you want.

338
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:45,516
This is your place here. All right?

339
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:47,316
Take whatever you want.

340
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:52,017
William, do you know about cars?
Can you give me a hand here?

341
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:53,417
I rode motorcycles.

342
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,817
- You mean the big ones?
- Harley.

343
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,017
Harley?

344
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:58,817
You were in a gang and stuff like that?

345
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:04,717
William... Open road,
women, biker's bar.

346
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,718
You have a tattoo, right?

347
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:10,918
Oh, my God.
That's what I'm talking about.

348
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:12,218
Original player.

349
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:14,618
Wow, William is chillin'!

350
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:08,122
Alex, you want to buy this DVD?

351
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,222
- I already saw it.
- It's new.

352
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,922
I already saw it.
How much does this cost?

353
00:23:12,022 --> 00:23:13,422
This is under $50.

354
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,722
And actually, they look really good.

355
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:17,823
You go to Silas Creek,
you can pay $70 a piece.

356
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:19,323
Look at this.

357
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:22,123
$70? For that money
I can buy a cell phone.

358
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:23,823
Cell phones are expensive,
but look here.

359
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:25,323
These are really good.
Look at the cloth.

360
00:23:25,423 --> 00:23:27,523
Hey, Alex, what you doing here?

361
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:28,923
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

362
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:30,523
Hey, Solo. What's up, man?

363
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:32,424
Alex is trying to get a cell phone.

364
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:34,124
Don't be selling her your crap.

365
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:35,524
- What's up?
- How you doing?

366
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,924
- Pretty good.
- What's up, Peter?

367
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:40,124
First time you get the taxi,
and you're still late!

368
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:43,024
I'm sorry, madame.
Sorry about that.

369
00:23:43,024 --> 00:23:44,924
If I had a cell phone,
you can just call me.

370
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,325
- Isn't that right, William?
- Yes.

371
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:49,725
Where are we going?

372
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:52,125
God knows where your dad's taking me.

373
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,125
I'm telling you,
this is the best place right here.

374
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,725
You got restaurants all over the place,
you can walk down to them.

375
00:23:57,825 --> 00:23:59,525
- It takes five minutes.
- Bye, William.

376
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,026
Bye, Alex.

377
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:02,926
When is the next time
you're going to the movies?

378
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,126
- I don't know.
- You have my cell phone, right?

379
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:07,226
Okay. You know what,
just give me a call

380
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:08,726
whenever you need anything, all right?

381
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:10,726
Okay?

382
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,126
Bye, William.

383
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:29,927
You think he's okay in there?

384
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:31,828
If he didn't like it, he would just leave.

385
00:24:31,828 --> 00:24:33,528
Yeah, I know, but you don't understand.

386
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:35,728
I understand more than you.

387
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:37,428
- Hey, Malaak.
- Hey, Solo.

388
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:38,428
- How you doing?
- Very good.

389
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:39,628
- How are you?
- I'm good.

390
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,228
- Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

391
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:44,228
Listen, I want to ask you a favor.
Could you keep an eye on my friend?

392
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:46,429
If anybody comes,
if a taxi comes and picks him up,

393
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:47,929
if anything strange happens,
please let me know.

394
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,029
- I will.
- All right?

395
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,029
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

396
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,029
- Hey, Solo?
- Yeah.

397
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:53,129
Can I get a phone card next time?

398
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:54,429
You mean a ten-dollar phone card?

399
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:55,729
- Yes, sir.
- I got you, big dawg.

400
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:56,829
- Bye.
- Bye.

401
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,230
- Have a good night.
- Bye, Alex.

402
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:13,935
Quiera, I'm really sorry,
but it's just not working.

403
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:15,035
No, no, Quiera, I did...

404
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:17,035
Whatever you asked me to do, I did it.

405
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:19,935
Whatever... No, no, no,
I never said that.

406
00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:21,535
No, listen, listen.
No, Quiera, listen!

407
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:23,735
Quiera! Hello? Hello?

408
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:30,836
She doesn't sound good.

409
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:34,136
I'm glad her aunt and her niece
are moving in, because...

410
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,136
What are you doing?

411
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:40,637
Dawg, I don't even know
what I'm doing right now.

412
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:43,737
Who the hell told you to come here?

413
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:46,237
You know I can't go to Navani.
I mean, I just can't.

414
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:48,537
And Roc... Roc is in with some stuff
I'm not interested in,

415
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:50,737
- so I figured maybe for a couple days...
- No.

416
00:26:50,837 --> 00:26:52,237
...I could...
- There's no room.

417
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:53,937
Big dawg, this place is huge!

418
00:26:54,037 --> 00:26:56,038
In Africa ten people can sleep in here.

419
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:57,838
Ten people!
And plus, see?

420
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:59,338
This is all I have.
This is all.

421
00:26:59,438 --> 00:27:00,838
I have nothing else.
See this bag?

422
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:02,538
This is the only thing I have here!

423
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,338
This sofa is perfect.
All I need is a tiny place to study.

424
00:27:05,438 --> 00:27:06,838
I didn't tell you.

425
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:09,138
Check this out.

426
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:10,439
I'm studying for my interview.

427
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,239
And this time, I'm going all the way.

428
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,239
I'm telling you, all the way.

429
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:16,939
No stopping!
Quiera says I can't do it.

430
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:18,839
Why not? I can do it!

431
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,639
I can do it, because you know what?

432
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,039
I want to do it. That's all.

433
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:25,640
So, big dawg, I'm just going
to chill in here and study, all right?

434
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,240
Is that cool with you?

435
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,740
See? I'm sitting here, I'm studying.

436
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,140
Can you see me?
You can't see me.

437
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,440
You're chilling over there, watching TV.
I'm here chilling, man.

438
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,440
You know what I'm saying?
This light over here...

439
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,640
if I turn it off and I don't smile,
you're not gonna notice...

440
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,541
Stay out of my stuff!

441
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:40,541
Keep your shit over there
and leave me alone.

442
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:41,841
Thank you very much, big dawg.

443
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:43,841
That's what I'm talking about.

444
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:45,341
Thank you. I appreciate that.

445
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:46,941
I appreciate it.

446
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:55,942
I have my interview on Monday,
and I'm going to ace it.

447
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,642
I really don't give a shit.

448
00:27:58,742 --> 00:27:59,742
I don't want to know.

449
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:03,642
I don't want to know about Quiera
or anything about your life.

450
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:07,242
Sorry about that.

451
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:24,744
If you like this place, you can keep it
when I leave next week.

452
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,644
Their rates are very fair.

453
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:32,848
6-4, 6-4. Pork Chop.

454
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:35,449
Come on, Cab 64.

455
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:38,249
Have you ever heard of this place
called Blowing Rock?

456
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:40,249
Blowing Rock?
Well, of course I have.

457
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:42,649
It's up in the mountains near Boone.

458
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:45,049
Actually, I know where it is,
but do you know if there's anything

459
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:47,149
happening there on October 20th?

460
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:48,549
Not to my knowledge.

461
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:50,350
We used to go there when we were kids.

462
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,550
It's the only place in the world
where the snow goes upside down.

463
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,250
What? I mean, what do you mean?

464
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:59,350
It's so windy, if you throw a stick
or anything off the rock,

465
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,350
it gets blown back into the sky.

466
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,851
Blown back up to the sky?

467
00:30:03,951 --> 00:30:06,251
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, Cab 64.

468
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:08,451
That's why it's called "Blowing Rock."

469
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:12,551
All right. 6-4 out.

470
00:30:45,853 --> 00:30:48,554
Sorry, William.
I didn't mean to wake you up.

471
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:55,054
I got us some playing cards.

472
00:30:57,054 --> 00:31:01,955
And I know you like DVDs,
so I got you some new releases.

473
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:04,355
We don't have a DVD player.

474
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:06,455
- Now would you be quiet?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

475
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:08,755
Just because I know
you like movies, you know.

476
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:10,355
Sorry about that.

477
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:18,456
Man, I miss them.

478
00:31:20,156 --> 00:31:21,856
Alex is getting ready to go to school now.

479
00:31:21,956 --> 00:31:24,956
She's probably having breakfast
with Quiera in the kitchen.

480
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:40,957
Are you married, William?

481
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:44,857
I was.

482
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:49,058
What happened?
You divorced?

483
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,158
My wife left me 30 years ago.

484
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:54,758
I'm sorry to hear that.

485
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:59,859
And do you have any kids?

486
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,559
No. None.

487
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,059
I'm trying to sleep.

488
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,859
Sorry about that.

489
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:10,259
It's just that I'm going to have
my first kid soon, you know?

490
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,160
Goodnight, William.

491
00:33:03,163 --> 00:33:05,663
"First Aid and the Flight Attendant.

492
00:33:05,663 --> 00:33:07,463
"Flight attendants are not responsible

493
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:10,863
"for diagnosing illness,
but to support life.

494
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:12,764
"No medicines.

495
00:33:12,864 --> 00:33:13,864
"Bleeding.

496
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:15,264
"Burns.

497
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:17,464
Heart attacks."

498
00:33:47,766 --> 00:33:50,866
This is just vitamin C, aspirin,
calcium, and antihistamine.

499
00:33:50,966 --> 00:33:52,466
Antihistamine? What's that?

500
00:33:52,566 --> 00:33:54,366
That's something that's used
to counter histamines.

501
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,867
And what does that mean?

502
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,267
If somebody has allergies.

503
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,767
These are just over-the-counter drugs.

504
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:01,467
So none of those is for anything serious?

505
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:02,567
No.

506
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,667
Like when somebody's
about to die or something?

507
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,167
Excuse me?

508
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:08,467
You know, something like cancer
or something like that?

509
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,868
No. Sir, if you're not feeling well,

510
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,468
I suggest you consult with a physician.

511
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,068
Are you okay?

512
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:19,468
I'm sorry about that, sir.

513
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:20,768
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

514
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,368
Is there anything else I can help you with?

515
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:23,868
No. I'm good.

516
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:26,369
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Okay.

517
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:58,071
There we go.

518
00:34:58,171 --> 00:35:00,371
- William and me, we're in room 213...
- You already told me that.

519
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:01,771
I already put it in.

520
00:35:01,771 --> 00:35:03,571
How did you even learn
the cell phone that fast?

521
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:05,471
It's not hard.

522
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:08,872
Now whenever you need a taxi,
you can call me, all right?

523
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:15,972
Bijou, it's going
to be all right, you know?

524
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,772
Mom says you're going to come back.

525
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:20,072
Whatever happened between Mom and me
has nothing to do with you.

526
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:21,172
You understand that, right?

527
00:35:21,272 --> 00:35:22,673
It doesn't matter if I understand.

528
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:25,873
It doesn't change anything in the past.

529
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,273
When you grow up, you'll understand.

530
00:35:27,373 --> 00:35:30,373
I don't want to grow up
and learn all that bullshit.

531
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:32,273
Where did you learn this word?

532
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,173
You know what?

533
00:35:35,273 --> 00:35:37,774
I bet you can't even use this phone
to take a picture of me.

534
00:35:37,774 --> 00:35:39,374
- Can, too.
- You don't know how to do that.

535
00:35:39,474 --> 00:35:40,574
I'll prove it.

536
00:35:40,574 --> 00:35:43,074
You'll prove it?
All right, there we go.

537
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:52,275
Let me see.

538
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,075
How come this hot dog
looks better than me?

539
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:56,675
That's not fair.

540
00:35:56,775 --> 00:35:58,775
No. You know what?
Show me, show me.

541
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:00,175
How do you do that?

542
00:36:30,277 --> 00:36:31,777
Thank you.
Enjoy the show.

543
00:36:31,877 --> 00:36:33,177
Thank you.

544
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:35,978
Hey, how can I help you?

545
00:36:36,078 --> 00:36:37,878
Yeah, two for Outcast.

546
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:40,378
All right.
That'll be $16, please.

547
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:43,878
Thank you.
Enjoy the show.

548
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:45,178
Thank you.

549
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:48,178
I really liked the movie.

550
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:50,179
- Thanks for recommending it.
- Yeah, no problem.

551
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:51,479
Acting was great.

552
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:52,779
- I'm a big fan of...
- William!

553
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,079
- Good-bye.
- Yep.

554
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,779
Hey, how can I help you?

555
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,980
Come in the front, big dawg.
Come, come.

556
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,180
What did you see?
How was your movie?

557
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,080
Why didn't you call me?

558
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:24,081
You've underlined a lot of words.

559
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:25,681
Yeah, it's because
I don't know the meaning

560
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:27,681
or I don't know how to pronounce it.

561
00:37:27,781 --> 00:37:31,681
Big dawg, why don't you quiz me
on a couple of terms?

562
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,582
Okay, we play for this trip.

563
00:37:35,982 --> 00:37:37,382
Let me break it down for you.

564
00:37:37,482 --> 00:37:40,582
If I win, it's free.
If you win, it's free.

565
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:44,182
Come on, just a few words
till we get to the motel, player.

566
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:49,383
- "Deadhead."
- All right, big dawg!

567
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:51,783
All right.
So you think you can win?

568
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:53,583
Okay. All right.

569
00:37:53,683 --> 00:37:56,383
So, "deadhead."

570
00:37:56,383 --> 00:37:59,883
"Deadhead" is the transport
of an off-duty crew member

571
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:03,384
for the purpose of positioning
for the working of a flight.

572
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:06,884
That's what I'm saying, big dawg.

573
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,784
That's what I'm saying.
I'm on it, man.

574
00:38:08,884 --> 00:38:10,984
I'm on it. I'm acing it.

575
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:12,884
Wow, you better try harder.
You better try harder.

576
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:14,884
I'm telling you,
or you're going to pay for this trip.

577
00:38:17,185 --> 00:38:20,085
"In the event of a water evacuation,

578
00:38:20,185 --> 00:38:23,685
what are the six steps
a flight attendant must take?"

579
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:25,585
Water evacuation.

580
00:38:25,585 --> 00:38:27,585
Okay. One, form a barrier.

581
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:32,186
Two, check conditions
and "rhetoric" if exits are blocked.

582
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:35,886
Three, open exits and inflate slide.

583
00:38:35,986 --> 00:38:37,986
Four, when opening a door exit

584
00:38:38,086 --> 00:38:40,386
to evacuate an aircraft...

585
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,986
That's strange.

586
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:48,887
Yo.

587
00:38:48,987 --> 00:38:51,487
This is cool.

588
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:53,387
You got to check this out.
Alex sent me that.

589
00:38:53,387 --> 00:38:55,587
I didn't know you could do that.

590
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:00,788
That's cool, right?

591
00:39:02,988 --> 00:39:04,488
Wow.

592
00:39:06,788 --> 00:39:08,788
How do you do that?

593
00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:10,488
How do I do that?

594
00:39:10,688 --> 00:39:12,888
How do you take a picture
and send it on a phone?

595
00:39:12,888 --> 00:39:16,289
I don't know.
That's why I'm kind of surprised.

596
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:19,189
She took my picture, but I didn't know
you could send it through the phone.

597
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:21,389
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

598
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:24,889
- "Redirect."
- "Redirect."

599
00:39:24,889 --> 00:39:26,989
Okay. I got you, big dawg.

600
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:30,990
"Rhetoric" is... it means
a whole different thing.

601
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,190
- Okay.
- "Redirect."

602
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,894
Yo, William, what's up?
How you doing?

603
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,194
Where the hell are my clothes?

604
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:42,195
I'm just going to wash them, big dawg.

605
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:45,095
The place is a little smelly
right now, that's all.

606
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:47,495
I hope you're not going
to take a nap right now.

607
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:49,595
I just want to go to the Laundromat.

608
00:40:49,695 --> 00:40:52,195
I'll be right back, okay?

609
00:40:53,295 --> 00:40:54,695
I'll see you in a second, eh?

610
00:40:54,795 --> 00:40:55,996
Bye.

611
00:41:15,297 --> 00:41:17,997
Malaak. Aw, man.

612
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:19,597
Hey, Solo.

613
00:41:19,697 --> 00:41:21,197
You got it?

614
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:28,698
- See you, dawg.
- Bye, Solo.

615
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,500
Give me a sentence.

616
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,700
ELB... Emergency Locator "Beckon."

617
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,700
"Beacon," not "Beckon."

618
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,200
"Beacon." It's a signal light.

619
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,000
"Beacon."

620
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,801
Alex?

621
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:13,901
- Get me some napkins.
- Okay.

622
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:16,901
Another word is "floo..."

623
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,701
"fl-flooter."

624
00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:21,401
"Flooter"?

625
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:23,602
"Flutter"?

626
00:42:23,702 --> 00:42:27,702
To move quickly, like a butterfly.

627
00:42:27,802 --> 00:42:30,702
That's kind of cool.

628
00:42:30,702 --> 00:42:32,702
Take that to Solo.

629
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:36,902
Thanks, Alex.

630
00:42:37,002 --> 00:42:39,803
Big dawg, thank you very much.

631
00:42:39,903 --> 00:42:41,103
That's cool.

632
00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:45,503
Thank you. Bon appétit.

633
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:52,804
Good sandwich, William.

634
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,904
Thank you.

635
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:58,104
I'm used to talking to all kinds of people
and I get along with them.

636
00:42:58,104 --> 00:42:59,904
People are happy in my cab,

637
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:02,904
and I also know how to handle
the ones that aren't so friendly.

638
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:04,404
Says here you speak French.

639
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:06,104
I speak French.

640
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:07,505
I speak English, as you can see.

641
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:09,605
I speak Wolof.
I speak Spanish.

642
00:43:09,605 --> 00:43:12,105
I mean, I'm getting better.
My wife is Mexican.

643
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:14,705
I also speak ten other African languages.

644
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:16,105
I'm a very curious person.

645
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:17,805
I like to learn about people's culture,

646
00:43:17,905 --> 00:43:20,605
and I think that's
very important for this job.

647
00:43:20,705 --> 00:43:23,006
That's true. Sounds good.

648
00:43:23,106 --> 00:43:25,506
Let's go ahead and begin the examination.

649
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:28,106
- I'm ready. Let's do it.
- Okay.

650
00:43:38,807 --> 00:43:41,007
William! William!

651
00:43:47,807 --> 00:43:49,507
Well?

652
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:51,608
I aced it, man! I killed it!

653
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,208
They're going to let me know in two days.

654
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:55,008
Get your jacket.
Let's go, let's go!

655
00:43:55,108 --> 00:43:57,008
It's party time tonight!
Get your jacket!

656
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:13,909
- You like this music right here?
- Yeah, it's okay.

657
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:16,609
I grew up in the rock and roll era.

658
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:17,809
It's the same, man.

659
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:19,910
You know, this is reggae,
rock and roll.

660
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,110
Big dawg, it's the same music.

661
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:23,510
But I got you.
You want some rock and roll?

662
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,210
If you can find it, yeah.

663
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,110
Here we go. Sure.

664
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,210
I like a little country now and then.

665
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,710
All right, no problem.

666
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,711
There we go, big dawg.

667
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:37,611
I don't know much
about this kind of music,

668
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:39,511
but it sounds good to me, too.

669
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:42,511
Well, then you've probably
never heard of Hank Williams.

670
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:44,511
- Hank Williams?
- Yeah.

671
00:44:44,511 --> 00:44:46,211
No, not really.

672
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:47,611
Not really. Who is that?

673
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:50,312
The greatest country writer
there ever was.

674
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,512
Wow. Okay. All right.

675
00:44:52,512 --> 00:44:54,312
I'll check him out.

676
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,613
Vargrave's that way.

677
00:45:09,713 --> 00:45:11,513
Damn, big dawg.

678
00:45:11,613 --> 00:45:13,913
Know what?
Let me make a U-turn up there.

679
00:45:14,013 --> 00:45:16,313
Good looking out, big dawg.

680
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,614
Good looking out.

681
00:45:19,914 --> 00:45:21,714
See if you can hit something.

682
00:45:21,714 --> 00:45:23,814
Not with your hand, man.

683
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:25,414
Not with your hand, with the stick.

684
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,414
All right.
Let's see that.

685
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:29,414
William, another one for you.

686
00:45:29,414 --> 00:45:30,914
Thank you.

687
00:45:31,014 --> 00:45:34,015
All right. Thanks, girl.

688
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:36,515
You know, your ex,
she's got a really nice ass.

689
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:38,815
Yo, big dawg!

690
00:45:38,815 --> 00:45:42,215
- Oh, my, my.
- Come on, Roc.

691
00:45:42,315 --> 00:45:43,815
William, what you got?

692
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:46,916
It's all that shit he's been smoking.
He can't even see the ball.

693
00:45:48,716 --> 00:45:51,416
- Oh, big dawg!
- I believe I scored.

694
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,616
Give me five, give me five!

695
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,116
That's what I'm talking about!

696
00:45:55,216 --> 00:45:56,316
Yo, man, here's your money.

697
00:46:01,417 --> 00:46:03,017
Yo, William, man.

698
00:46:03,017 --> 00:46:04,517
I know this place.
You want to go?

699
00:46:04,617 --> 00:46:06,017
You want another round?

700
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:07,317
Might as well.

701
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:08,817
All right!
That's what I'm talking about!

702
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:10,217
That place, the music is dope.

703
00:46:10,217 --> 00:46:14,117
And they have girls with big booties.

704
00:46:15,718 --> 00:46:17,718
You like the big booties, don't you?

705
00:46:33,019 --> 00:46:35,019
- Oh, yeah!
- Hey, hey, hey!

706
00:46:35,019 --> 00:46:36,319
Okay, Solo.

707
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,319
Yeah!

708
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:43,019
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Way to go, Solo!

709
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,420
- And that...
- They're light.

710
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,020
- That... Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

711
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,620
I can't believe what they do now.

712
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,620
That's kind of, like, just crazy.

713
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,220
I need to get one of those myself.

714
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,220
You know what I'm saying?
Tired of those...

715
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,520
Hello? Hey, William?

716
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,021
William, it's you?

717
00:46:59,121 --> 00:47:00,921
Yeah, I have my taxi.

718
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:02,121
To the bank? Yeah.

719
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:04,121
No problem.
I got you, all right?

720
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:05,321
- Yo!
- What's up?

721
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:06,821
Can you take me somewhere?
Just five minutes.

722
00:47:06,921 --> 00:47:08,221
I got to go pick up a friend.

723
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:09,821
After that, you can drop me off at Willard.

724
00:47:09,921 --> 00:47:11,621
- I got a trip right now.
- Come on, man.

725
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:12,721
I got you. Don't worry.

726
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:14,822
- I got your back, all right?
- All right, I'll take you.

727
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:16,422
- See you guys!
- All right, guys.

728
00:47:30,623 --> 00:47:31,623
Here we are, gentlemen.

729
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,023
No, William.
We'll wait for you.

730
00:47:33,123 --> 00:47:34,123
- Seven dollars.
- It's fine.

731
00:47:34,223 --> 00:47:35,423
Come on, man.
We'll wait for you.

732
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:37,223
It's okay.
You're not going to be long.

733
00:47:37,223 --> 00:47:39,823
- I'm closing my accounts.
- Thank you very much.

734
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:43,224
William, what do you mean
you're closing your accounts?

735
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:50,024
So we going back to Willard?

736
00:47:55,224 --> 00:47:57,825
You know we will wait for you.
I have to take a nap anyway, all right?

737
00:47:57,925 --> 00:47:59,825
- I got stuff to do afterwards.
- That's great!

738
00:47:59,925 --> 00:48:01,325
Wait for me.
I'll be right back.

739
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:02,825
I'll go get my cab.

740
00:48:02,825 --> 00:48:04,325
Wait for me here, okay?

741
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:18,926
Man, I don't know what's going on here,

742
00:48:18,926 --> 00:48:20,626
but I got someone waiting on me.

743
00:48:20,726 --> 00:48:23,426
Do you want me to take you
back to Willard or not?

744
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,926
Come on, Souléymane.

745
00:48:25,026 --> 00:48:27,527
Let's go, man. Let's go.

746
00:49:08,429 --> 00:49:10,430
Yo, Solo!

747
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:12,130
Yo!

748
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:27,431
Solo, you left your jacket
in Oz's cab last night.

749
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:30,431
That's William's.
Thank you.

750
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:32,331
Yes, sir. Thank you.

751
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,334
William?

752
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:16,034
William, are you there?

753
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,148
William.

754
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:43,748
William, are you awake?

755
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:47,749
No.

756
00:53:49,049 --> 00:53:50,349
What's wrong?

757
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:52,349
Please tell me what's wrong with you.

758
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:55,549
I can't do this anymore.

759
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:57,249
I know you don't want me to say that...

760
00:53:57,249 --> 00:53:59,950
It's late. I'm sleeping.

761
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:07,450
I'm sorry. I went through your stuff
and I took your pills to the pharmacy.

762
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:11,050
There's nothing wrong with you.
It's only vitamins.

763
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:13,451
I didn't want to, but I had to.

764
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:16,351
Things are good, and you still want
to go and close your account.

765
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:18,951
Why do you want to do this?

766
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:25,651
I went to the cinema tonight.

767
00:54:26,951 --> 00:54:28,652
The boy was there.

768
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:34,352
William, I saw his photo in your jacket.
You left it in the taxi.

769
00:54:34,352 --> 00:54:36,852
Who is he?

770
00:54:36,852 --> 00:54:39,152
You told me you had no kids.
Why are you lying to me?

771
00:54:39,252 --> 00:54:40,852
I'm telling you everything.

772
00:54:43,753 --> 00:54:45,253
Is he your grandson?

773
00:54:54,353 --> 00:54:55,753
William.

774
00:54:57,554 --> 00:54:58,654
William, I want to help you.

775
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,754
Did you talk to him?

776
00:55:02,754 --> 00:55:03,854
William, please.

777
00:55:07,354 --> 00:55:10,354
- Did you fucking talk to him?
- No, I didn't.

778
00:55:10,354 --> 00:55:11,855
But he doesn't know
who you are, does he?

779
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:12,955
Why don't you tell him?

780
00:55:13,055 --> 00:55:16,655
I want you to get your shit
and get the fuck out of here.

781
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:18,655
William, why are you speaking this way?

782
00:55:22,255 --> 00:55:24,755
- William.
- Get the fuck out!

783
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:27,156
We're friends now, and you want
to leave me and him, the boy?

784
00:55:27,256 --> 00:55:29,356
Who the fuck told you
you could get into my life?

785
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:30,756
Who the fuck do you think you are

786
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:32,356
that you can touch anything
that belongs to me?

787
00:55:32,456 --> 00:55:33,656
I got to tell him.

788
00:55:33,756 --> 00:55:35,956
I got to bring him here
so you're not going to...

789
00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:40,457
You're not going to tell him a damn thing.

790
00:55:40,557 --> 00:55:42,057
You understand me?

791
00:55:42,157 --> 00:55:46,157
I told you from day one,
stay the fuck out of my life!

792
00:55:51,257 --> 00:55:52,357
I put the photo back.

793
00:56:06,758 --> 00:56:10,559
William, please, don't leave.

794
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,359
I want you to stay.

795
00:56:12,459 --> 00:56:15,259
Alex wants you to stay
and the boy wants you to stay...

796
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:16,859
if you tell him.

797
00:56:20,359 --> 00:56:21,559
I got to get some ice.

798
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:23,760
- No, I'll get it for you.
- Sit down and shut up!

799
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,160
Sit down!

800
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,360
I want you to get your things,
leave, and don't come back.

801
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,760
- But, William...
- No!

802
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,860
Our deal for the 20th is off.

803
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,360
You're no longer my driver.

804
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:33,764
Shit. Fucker.

805
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:35,464
Slow down, man.

806
00:57:35,564 --> 00:57:37,865
Jesus Christ.

807
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:25,168
Mom saw the letter.
She doesn't want you to come in.

808
00:58:26,968 --> 00:58:28,868
- Did she open it?
- No.

809
00:58:28,968 --> 00:58:31,768
- What happened to your eye?
- I just fell.

810
00:58:31,868 --> 00:58:34,469
It doesn't look like you fell.
Did someone hit you?

811
00:58:36,769 --> 00:58:39,169
- I miss you, Alex.
- I do, too.

812
00:58:39,169 --> 00:58:40,169
I need to start going.

813
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:41,369
Wait, wait.
You don't want to know?

814
00:58:41,469 --> 00:58:43,569
Yeah, you can just text me!
Good luck!

815
00:58:43,669 --> 00:58:45,169
Bye, Alex.

816
00:59:20,272 --> 00:59:23,772
Hi, William.
It's me, Solo.

817
00:59:23,872 --> 00:59:26,972
I wanted to tell you I got
the results of my interview.

818
00:59:28,072 --> 00:59:29,872
William, I failed.

819
00:59:31,272 --> 00:59:33,973
I thought you'd want to know.

820
00:59:33,973 --> 00:59:37,173
Yeah, you were clear,
but I thought you'd want...

821
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,773
Yeah, but...

822
00:59:55,074 --> 00:59:58,574
Come in, Cab 75. 75.

823
01:00:00,574 --> 01:00:02,275
75.

824
01:00:03,675 --> 01:00:08,575
75, get 941. 941J.

825
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,475
Holland Avenue.

826
01:00:10,475 --> 01:00:12,875
Alex, what are you doing up so late?

827
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:15,475
What? Right now?

828
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:16,976
I'm going to be there!
I'll be there right now!

829
01:00:17,076 --> 01:00:18,376
Pork Chop.

830
01:00:18,376 --> 01:00:20,276
Please, give me the keys.
Give me the keys for 64.

831
01:00:20,376 --> 01:00:22,176
- What's wrong, Solo?
- Girl, I got to go!

832
01:00:22,276 --> 01:00:24,676
- Please give me the keys, girl!
- I can't do it.

833
01:00:24,776 --> 01:00:26,676
No, I'm not going to do it.

834
01:00:26,776 --> 01:00:28,376
- You need to calm down.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

835
01:00:28,476 --> 01:00:30,076
Don't be running up in here,
acting like that.

836
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:31,377
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the keys back.

837
01:00:31,477 --> 01:00:33,577
I told you you couldn't get the keys.

838
01:00:37,277 --> 01:00:39,577
Hurry up, Solo.
Where were you?

839
01:00:40,977 --> 01:00:42,677
- Hurry up!
- How is she?

840
01:00:42,677 --> 01:00:44,377
- She's fine. It's a boy.
- It's a boy?

841
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:45,478
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

842
01:00:45,578 --> 01:00:46,678
Where is she?

843
01:00:46,878 --> 01:00:48,878
She's over there,
but I need to check in.

844
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,278
- Over there?
- This is my step-dad...

845
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:52,078
Come on, let's go.
Is this Quiera Diop?

846
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:54,278
- Yes, that hallway.
- Okay.

847
01:00:54,378 --> 01:00:55,978
Wow, how's the baby?
You see the baby?

848
01:00:58,078 --> 01:00:59,779
I got a boy.

849
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,080
Quiera, you all right?

850
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:21,180
I told you a hundred times
we are both fine.

851
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,580
I like that you speak Spanish to him.

852
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,381
He's going to grow up
speaking four languages.

853
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:30,981
And how is he supposed
to learn French and Wolof, huh?

854
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:33,181
Tell me.

855
01:01:33,281 --> 01:01:35,281
I just don't understand.

856
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:37,381
I saw how happy you were
holding the baby

857
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:39,481
in your hands just now.

858
01:01:39,581 --> 01:01:41,081
You know we love you.

859
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:43,882
And you know that we want
what's best for you.

860
01:01:43,882 --> 01:01:45,982
And I know you love us.

861
01:01:46,082 --> 01:01:47,882
You can't leave.

862
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:01,483
Solo, you have to trust me.

863
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:04,983
I wish you could trust me, too.
And that's the problem.

864
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:08,283
Quiera, you know I love you,
and I'd do anything for the family.

865
01:02:08,283 --> 01:02:10,183
But I've always tried things your way,

866
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:12,484
and you never gave my way a chance.

867
01:02:12,484 --> 01:02:14,184
And I wish you can understand that.

868
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:17,884
I'm going to come back.

869
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,684
I'm going to call you to see if you need
anything else before I come.

870
01:02:22,884 --> 01:02:24,384
Have a good night.

871
01:03:33,489 --> 01:03:35,089
Hey, can I help you?

872
01:03:36,489 --> 01:03:38,790
Sir?

873
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:41,190
- Hi.
- Hey.

874
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:47,090
You work here, right?

875
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,590
Excuse me?

876
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:51,090
- You work at night.
- Sometimes.

877
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,391
Would you like to see a movie?

878
01:03:55,991 --> 01:03:56,991
Sir?

879
01:03:57,091 --> 01:04:00,391
Do you know this old man called William?

880
01:04:00,491 --> 01:04:02,791
Excuse me, who are you talking about?

881
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,191
We have some screenings in an hour.

882
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:05,791
Would you like a ticket?

883
01:04:07,892 --> 01:04:08,892
Sir?

884
01:04:10,592 --> 01:04:12,992
- Sir?
- Sorry.

885
01:04:13,092 --> 01:04:15,192
Forget about it.
Sorry about that.

886
01:04:15,192 --> 01:04:16,492
Okay.

887
01:04:42,794 --> 01:04:45,094
6-4, 6-4.

888
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:47,094
Come on, Cab 64.

889
01:04:47,194 --> 01:04:50,294
Pork Chop, who's been
to the King's Inn Motel since yesterday?

890
01:04:50,394 --> 01:04:52,395
Come on now, 64.

891
01:04:52,495 --> 01:04:54,695
No, really, girl.
You got to help me out here.

892
01:04:54,695 --> 01:04:56,595
34 picked that trip up.

893
01:04:56,595 --> 01:04:58,995
Mamadou.
A half an hour ago.

894
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:01,895
Mamadou?
And where is he at?

895
01:05:01,995 --> 01:05:05,295
Around the Baptist area.

896
01:05:05,295 --> 01:05:06,596
All right, 6-4 out.

897
01:05:11,796 --> 01:05:14,996
3-4, 3-4, this is 6-4.

898
01:05:15,196 --> 01:05:17,196
3-4, 6-4.

899
01:05:18,796 --> 01:05:20,797
Mamadou, this is Solo.

900
01:05:24,297 --> 01:05:27,697
3-4, 3-4, this is 6-4.

901
01:05:28,697 --> 01:05:31,797
3-4, 3-4, this is 6-4.

902
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:37,298
3-4, 3-4, 6-4.

903
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:53,899
3-4, Mamadou.

904
01:05:53,999 --> 01:05:56,399
This is Solo, 6-4.

905
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,100
Mamadou!

906
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,900
Pull over, pull over!

907
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,100
Mamadou, unroll your window.

908
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,300
What do you want?

909
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,001
I want to ask you something.

910
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:20,301
Pull over!
Pull over right here.

911
01:06:20,401 --> 01:06:22,301
I can't do it.
I got customers in my car.

912
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:26,101
I got to talk to you.
Mamadou, I got to talk to you.

913
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:28,501
All right, fine.
Follow me.

914
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,603
Hey, man, what's going on?
I got a trip.

915
01:06:49,703 --> 01:06:51,303
I want to ask you something real quick.

916
01:06:51,403 --> 01:06:53,303
Listen, did you pick up
an old man 30 minutes ago

917
01:06:53,303 --> 01:06:55,403
- at the King's Inn Motel?
- Yeah. So what?

918
01:06:55,503 --> 01:06:57,003
Did he offer you a trip
for tomorrow morning?

919
01:06:57,103 --> 01:06:58,603
- No.
- Why are you lying?

920
01:06:58,703 --> 01:07:00,103
What the fuck is going on?

921
01:07:00,203 --> 01:07:01,904
Okay, whatever deal
you guys have is cancelled.

922
01:07:02,004 --> 01:07:04,404
- The deal is not fucking cancelled.
- Mamadou, the deal is cancelled.

923
01:07:04,504 --> 01:07:07,704
- The man paid me $200 deposit, man.
- I don't give a shit about his $200.

924
01:07:07,704 --> 01:07:09,604
And plus, you see?
You're a fucking liar.

925
01:07:09,604 --> 01:07:11,304
- Are you calling me a fucking liar?
- You're a liar!

926
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:12,604
Mamadou, I'm talking to you.

927
01:07:12,604 --> 01:07:14,404
- Don't fucking grab me.
- I'm talking to you...

928
01:07:16,305 --> 01:07:17,505
Hey, come on, you guys.

929
01:07:20,905 --> 01:07:23,105
Mamadou, I don't care
about the money, all right?

930
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,805
But you're going to tell me
where you dropped him.

931
01:07:24,905 --> 01:07:26,205
Fuck you, man!

932
01:07:26,305 --> 01:07:28,105
I swear you're going to tell me
where you dropped him.

933
01:07:28,305 --> 01:07:30,405
- Hey, man. Easy.
- Come on, chill out, man.

934
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,806
- Come on, dawg.
- Mamadou, where did you drop him?

935
01:07:32,806 --> 01:07:33,806
Hold on. Hold it, man.

936
01:08:13,908 --> 01:08:15,809
What do you want?

937
01:08:15,809 --> 01:08:17,809
I'm here to take you
where you want to go.

938
01:08:17,809 --> 01:08:20,309
Where's my driver?
I didn't ask for you.

939
01:08:20,309 --> 01:08:23,209
William, I'm here to take you
wherever you want to go.

940
01:08:27,909 --> 01:08:29,410
Where to?

941
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:33,110
The motel.

942
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:56,911
William, I saw the other driver
and he canceled the trip with you.

943
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:58,412
I'll take you tomorrow morning.

944
01:08:58,612 --> 01:09:00,312
That was our deal.

945
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:11,212
What time should I pick you up?

946
01:09:22,513 --> 01:09:24,213
8 a.m.

947
01:11:47,823 --> 01:11:49,723
William.

948
01:11:52,024 --> 01:11:53,024
Good morning.

949
01:11:53,124 --> 01:11:54,824
Morning.

950
01:11:54,924 --> 01:11:56,424
Thank you.

951
01:11:56,624 --> 01:11:59,824
You want to wash up?
Then we'll be leaving.

952
01:13:17,729 --> 01:13:21,930
"I made a joke about
how bad a film was,

953
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:26,630
"and when he laughed,
his lip twitched.

954
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:29,130
He looked just like his mother."

955
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:54,832
"He's studying hard.

956
01:13:54,832 --> 01:13:57,432
"I'm trying to help him the best I can.

957
01:13:57,532 --> 01:13:59,732
I think he will pass."

958
01:14:30,134 --> 01:14:34,935
"I don't think Solo knows
that Alex fixed the curtains.

959
01:14:34,935 --> 01:14:37,035
"She is so smart.

960
01:14:37,035 --> 01:14:39,635
I wonder who she will become."

961
01:15:26,038 --> 01:15:27,638
Isn't that nice?

962
01:15:27,738 --> 01:15:29,139
See? Almost new.

963
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:30,739
You like that?

964
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,839
It's very nice.

965
01:15:37,839 --> 01:15:40,239
Thank you.

966
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,040
William, I have a favor.

967
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,541
- I want Alex to come with us.
- No.

968
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:03,841
William, I just can't come back alone.

969
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:06,641
I can't believe you're saying that. No.

970
01:16:08,841 --> 01:16:11,641
I need Alex with me.

971
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:13,542
Please allow me that.

972
01:16:35,743 --> 01:16:37,343
Hi, William. Hi, Solo.

973
01:16:37,443 --> 01:16:40,043
- Hi, Alex.
- You ready?

974
01:18:55,153 --> 01:18:56,853
Come on, hurry up.

975
01:18:59,453 --> 01:19:01,353
Hurry up, slowpokes.

976
01:19:26,155 --> 01:19:28,055
Blowing Rock's this way!
Come on!

977
01:19:28,155 --> 01:19:29,755
Hey, Alex, don't you want
some ice cream?

978
01:19:29,855 --> 01:19:31,355
No. I want to go to Blowing Rock.

979
01:19:31,355 --> 01:19:33,055
We will, but let's go get
some ice cream first.

980
01:19:33,155 --> 01:19:34,155
They have cookies and cream.

981
01:19:34,255 --> 01:19:35,556
- They do?
- Yeah.

982
01:19:35,556 --> 01:19:38,556
Wow! Come on, William.
What are you going to get?

983
01:19:38,556 --> 01:19:40,956
Alex, William has to go meet a friend.
He's going to be late.

984
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:43,556
- So let's go, and we'll meet him later.
- Are you sure?

985
01:19:44,756 --> 01:19:45,756
Yes.

986
01:19:45,856 --> 01:19:47,556
Okay. Bye, William.

987
01:19:47,656 --> 01:19:50,057
Bye, Alex.

988
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:13,758
Hurry up, Solo!

989
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:20,159
Solo, come on.

990
01:20:29,459 --> 01:20:30,859
Come on.

991
01:20:32,559 --> 01:20:35,260
Isn't this place so pretty?

992
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:40,860
I'm going to get two scoops of ice cream.

993
01:22:16,567 --> 01:22:18,167
Pretty cool, huh?

994
01:22:23,267 --> 01:22:25,167
Do you know if you throw
a stick off Blowing Rock,

995
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:26,267
it comes right back to you?

996
01:22:26,367 --> 01:22:28,667
- For real?
- Yeah.

997
01:22:28,767 --> 01:22:29,768
Cool! Come on, let's go.

998
01:22:29,868 --> 01:22:31,968
- We'll go later.
- No, come on!

999
01:22:32,068 --> 01:22:33,368
Alex.

1000
01:22:33,468 --> 01:22:34,968
Come on.

1001
01:22:35,068 --> 01:22:36,568
Alex, wait.

1002
01:22:38,168 --> 01:22:39,768
Alex, come back.

1003
01:22:43,568 --> 01:22:45,769
Hurry up, Solo.

1004
01:22:45,769 --> 01:22:48,769
Watch out, Alex.
I don't want you to fall down.

1005
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,369
Hurry up, Solo.
There's Blowing Rock!

1006
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:01,570
Hold on. Watch out.

1007
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:03,070
Hurry, up!

1008
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:11,370
Hurry up, Solo.

1009
01:23:16,771 --> 01:23:18,471
Look, Solo, look!

1010
01:23:21,471 --> 01:23:23,171
- No.
- But I want to see.

1011
01:23:23,171 --> 01:23:25,471
You're going to fall.
It's dangerous.

1012
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:27,371
Then let me go get another stick.

1013
01:23:27,371 --> 01:23:29,872
Yeah, but be very careful, okay?

1014
01:24:53,477 --> 01:24:56,378
Hey, Alex, be careful!

1015
01:24:56,378 --> 01:24:58,478
No, it's too dangerous.
I don't want you to come here.

1016
01:24:58,578 --> 01:24:59,578
It's too dangerous.

1017
01:24:59,578 --> 01:25:01,978
Then here, Solo.
You throw it.

1018
01:25:45,981 --> 01:25:47,981
Is this your textbook?

1019
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:49,281
Yes.

1020
01:25:49,381 --> 01:25:51,981
Are you going to try again?

1021
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:55,582
I think so.

1022
01:25:55,682 --> 01:25:58,082
Let me give you a little quiz right here.

1023
01:26:00,582 --> 01:26:04,082
Let's see.
What is "XLV"?

1024
01:26:05,582 --> 01:26:09,183
Aw, come on, Solo.
I know you know it.

1025
01:26:09,283 --> 01:26:10,683
"Extra Life Vest."

1026
01:26:10,683 --> 01:26:11,983
You see?
You got it right.

1027
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,883
Bravo!

1028
01:26:13,983 --> 01:26:15,583
Let me find another one.

1029
01:26:17,883 --> 01:26:19,483
I'm sure you can get this one.

1030
01:26:19,483 --> 01:26:21,984
"In the event of a water evacuation,

1031
01:26:22,084 --> 01:26:26,884
what are the six steps
a flight attendant must take?"

1032
01:26:26,984 --> 01:26:29,784
Come on, Solo, I know you.

1033
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:32,284
You can get them.

1034
01:26:32,384 --> 01:26:35,684
One, form a barrier.

1035
01:26:35,784 --> 01:26:39,085
Two, check conditions and redirect

1036
01:26:39,185 --> 01:26:41,185
when exits are blocked.

1037
01:26:41,185 --> 01:26:46,085
Three, open exits and inflate slides.

1038
01:26:46,085 --> 01:26:48,085
You're doing great right now.

1039
01:26:48,085 --> 01:26:52,586
Four, when opening a door exit
to evacuate an aircraft,

1040
01:26:52,686 --> 01:26:55,486
rotate the handle
in the direction of the arrow

1041
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:57,486
and open the door forcefully enough

1042
01:26:57,586 --> 01:27:00,886
that it locks against
the side of the fuselage.

1043
