00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,138
Did you give your friend
back his stuff?

3
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:22,226
Oh, yeah. He wasn't there,
so I left it in his room.

4
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,311
How'd you get in
if he wasn't there?

5
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,355
His roommate
let me in.

6
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,441
What kind of question
is that?

7
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,444
I thought you broke in
or something. I don't know.

8
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,628
Now, don't worry
about this tablecloth.

9
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,257
Oh, that's beautiful.

10
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,052
Oh, that is really nice.

11
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,222
Don't be nervous. She's the one
who's supposed to be nervous.

12
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:03,559
Yeah, well, if her family
just wasn't so rich.

13
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,936
<i>She's not marrying Matt
for his money.</i>

14
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,064
That's good, because if she is,
she's in for a terrible surprise.

15
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,403
Matt was saying that he didn't think
she'd ever seen artificial fabric...

16
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,405
before she went to college.

17

- [Laughing]
- Oh.

18
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,704
This is so nice. I wish somebody had gone to all
this trouble for me when I was getting married.

19
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,141
- Give me the glasses.
- I got'em.

20
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,143
You smell like alcohol.

21
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,562
Take the back way, go up
the stairs to the shower...

22
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,940
run it hot until it's all gone
and you've sweated the liquor out.

23
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:56,778
Well, if I'm such a screw up that I can't even
go in the front door of my own house...

24
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,448
You want to go in the front door, Tim?
You go ahead.

25
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,909
Go in the front door
and go hug your mother.

26
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,412
Is that what you want to do?
Then why don't you do it?

27
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,790
- I said I was sorry.
- I'm tired of you being sorry, Tim.

28
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,834
I am worn out
with sorry.

29
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,880
Instead of being so damn sorry all the time,
you might just try a little discipline.

30
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,107
<i>[Woman]
Phil, is that you?</i>

31
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,151
Tim?

32
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:40,072
- You're late.
- Oh, yeah.

33
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,784
Oh, good.
You remembered the glasses.

34
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,621
And the shrimp.
Aren't you good.

35
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,624
Yeah.

36
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,502
I thought we weren't gonna make
a big deal of this.

37
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,422
<i>Matt said that we shouldn't
make a big deal of things.</i>

38
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:02,511
Oh. Phil, a tablecloth
isn't a big deal.

39
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,597
A tablecloth is a tablecloth.
Where's Tim?

40
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:10,811
- Upstairs. He's, uh...
- What?

41
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,816
Nothing. Uh...
The toilet had a thing today.

42
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,318
Somebody stuffed it
with little creamer packages.

43
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,321
I could have brought you
a tablecloth from the restaurant.

44
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,825
For this size table?
What are you talking about, Phil?

45
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,828
Come on. Allison
is used to nice things.

46
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,414
Did you have to call
the plumber?

47
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,209
For what?

48
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,380
- For the toilet.
- Oh. No. No, uh...

49
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,424
Tim got it.
He just kept at it.

50
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:44,928
See? I don't know why you
worry about him so much.

Thank you.

56
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,790
We almost did find a tenant, but he got
arrested two days before he moved in.

57
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,251
So I guess it turned out
to be a good thing.

58
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,879
<i>Except that we turned down
a really nice couple.</i>

59
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,466
Karen, uh, cut the celery in half
before you slice it.

60
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:26,011
- What?
- In half.

61
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,472
Here.
Like this.

62
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,724
Oh. Okay.

63
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,602
Anyway, this nice couple
would have been great...

64
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,648
except they tried to bargain with us,
which irritated Tom.

65
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,151
I would have tried to bargain too.
You never know. It doesn't hurt to ask.

66
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,154
Considering we don't get free rent
unless the whole place is full...

67
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,490
we can't really afford
to hold a grudge.

68
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,826
Anyway, when we called them back,
they'd already found...

69
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,915
What do you think?

70
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,544
Should I put these out now, or should I
wait until Matt and Allison get here?

71
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,797
- Uh, whatever.
- Hmm.

<i>Having children is
an economic thing too, though.</i>

73
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,600
You have to
plan for it.

74
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,021
And have
some kind of savings.

75
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:21,024
I've always thought that if you've
got the love, then everything else...

76
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,902
Lisa quit teaching school
the moment Karen was born.

77
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,363
It was a decision
we were prepared to make...

78
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,824
<i>because we had worked
and saved for it.</i>

79

That's what you have to do.

Right. Right.

81
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,266
So...

- Is this it?
- Yes. This is it. This is it.

Wow.

You've seen the pond
where I twisted my ankle. Right?

85
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,695
You've seen the church
where I was confirmed. Right?

And I scored so well
on my National Merit Test...

97
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,571
that I got
a scholarship to Yale...

One month

One month of behind-the-wheel

Well, not the most important part.

- Okay.
- But, uh... You know, I, uh...

All right.

364
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:16,850
What I want to know here is if you are
really and truly committed to Allison.

365
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:21,063
- For better, for worse and all that?

I mean... Well...

369

Sometimes, uh,
we feel like we're...

I don't know.

You should talk about it

00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,519
You're saying my father
told you I can't...

S200 missing from petty cash.

- Blackmail?

436
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,975
I noticed the day after
the health inspector came...

437
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:53,645
you borrowed
S150 from petty cash...

438
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:56,940
and you listed it
as cleanup expenses.

439
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,485
- We can list it as that.
- What's the point of this?

440
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:02,529
I'll tell you what the point is.

441
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:05,908
I'm tired of pretending, you know,

<i>Nick?</i>

447
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:32,184

Are you satisfied?

Oh, yeah.
I'm really satisfied.

<i>- You've made my life worth living.</i>
- Oh, for God sakes.

452
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:54,831
You know, I resent...

453
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:57,501
I really resent the way
you look down on me.

454
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:01,296
I try. I'm here.
I'm doing something.

455
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:05,092
It's not like you're so much better
than me. It's not like you're perfect.

456
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,970
<i>And if I want a drink
in the afternoon right now...</i>

457
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:10,097
then I think
I should have it.

I'm through explaining things to you!</i>

I've done my time
on Maple Drive. Okay?

460
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,942
So I flunked out of school.
So what?

461
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,945
Why couldn't we have just
told Mom I flunked out of school?

462
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:26,989
Huh?
I didn't kill anyone.

463
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,283
I had a bad time.
So what?

464
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,494
Why can't we tell her
and just move on? Why?

465
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:36,832
What's gonna happen? What's gonna happen
if we just sit down and say it out loud, Dad?

466
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,130
Look...
[Chuckles]

467
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:46,550
If I have to live this way...

468
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,303
I think I deserve
a drink now and then.

469
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:51,471
If I want it. Okay?

470
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:53,557
I think it's what I deserve.

471
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,106
Why do you do it here?

472
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,108
Why don't you do it
somewhere else?

473
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,194
Why do you
force me to watch it?

474
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,658
Because I think
it's what you deserve.

475
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,166
What I deserve?

476
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,128
I think you should know, Tim...

477
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:26,298
the last few days,
every time I have seen you...

478

every time
I have looked at you...

479
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:34,681
the only response I have had is
to thank God I have another son.

480
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,105
You have all the advantages.

481
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,191
That doesn't work for me.

482
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,028
I look at you,
and there isn't anyone else.

483
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:50,280
You're the only father I've got.

484
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:55,160
Which one of us
is worse off? I wonder.

- But I think he's gonna be okay.

[Phil] Uh-huh. Did he say anything?
Is he conscious?

I was wondering, what was
the alcohol level of his blood?

761

the blood alcohol level

just frozen there, and I-I...

turned the steering wheel
and I hit my brake.

next time, kill the dog.</i>

but we couldn't find
the right number...

816

<i>and I'm pretty sure her parents
have unlisted phones.</i>

They have
unlisted addresses, Mom.

818
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,974
That's all right. I called her
this afternoon, and, uh...

819
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:56,435
she wanted to come up,
but I told her not to.

anyone here before I came back.

Well, why didn't
you say something?

<i>The telephone pole
Matt ran into.</i>

880
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:40,737
Curious thing about it was that you
could follow the path the car took...

<i>once it went off the highway...</i>

I didn't have a car accident, Andy.
I drove my car off the road on purpose.

What? Why would you
do something like that?

01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:27,523
Get away with what?
[Scoffs]

1051
01:17:27,606 --> 01:17:29,650
What am I letting him
get away with?

1052
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:32,694
With embarrassing us.

1053
01:17:32,736 --> 01:17:34,696
With humiliating us.

1054
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:39,701
Maybe it's not about us.
Maybe it's about him.

1055
01:17:39,785 --> 01:17:42,829
What are you t...

1056
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:46,166
Of course it's about us.

1057
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,293
All of it.

1058
01:17:48,377 --> 01:17:51,630
I... I've spent
my entire life sacrificing...

1059
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:55,008
so m-my children
can have a future.

1060
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:58,762
So they can be something.

1061
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:02,933
Don't... Don't tell me
it's not about us.

1062
01:18:03,016 --> 01:18:05,185
It is us. This is us.

1063
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:09,189
What do you
want from him, Lisa?

1064
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:11,733
Would you rather have his brains
smashed around the street?

1065
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:14,653
Or see him hanging in the garage?
What is it you want?

1066
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,957
Do you love
your children, Lisa?

1067
01:18:29,418 --> 01:18:33,172
<i>Whatever they are,
they're our children.</i>

1068
01:18:38,385 --> 01:18:40,804
It's a lie.

1069
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:43,432
It's all a lie.

1070
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:46,685
No, it's not a lie.

1071
01:18:49,688 --> 01:18:51,899
This is a lie!

1072
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,151
- And that's a lie.
- Lisa! Lisa.

1073
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:56,278
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- And this is a lie...

1074
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:59,072
- No. No, it's not a lie.
- This is...

01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:21,970
Please what?

1078
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:28,435
It seemed like...
What choice do I have?

1079
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:31,772
Tom, it's my body.

1080
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:35,108
Fine. This is my body,
and I can do with it what I want...

1081
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:38,320
and right now,
I want to take it home.

1082
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:42,074
<i>- I wanted to tell you.</i>
- Well, now you don't have to.

1083
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:45,702
I didn't want to go
behind your back.

1084
01:19:45,786 --> 01:19:50,958
But you did,
and I can't live like that.

1085
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:55,003
I'll make allowances for you 'cause I know
that's the way you were raised, but, uh...

1086
01:19:57,089 --> 01:20:01,051
I'm not your parents.
So why lie to me?

1087
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:06,682
- 'Cause I'm afraid.
<i>- Of course you are.</i>

1088
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:10,269
Maybe we're not meant to be parents,
but we have to discuss it, Karen.

1089
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:15,691
First, you have to
come to a decision...

1090
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:18,986
because I've put you first
in this marriage all along.

1091
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:22,739
I love my parents
a lot, but, um...

1092
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:25,868
I'm your husband first,
and they know that.

1093
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:32,457
I'm sorry, Tom.
I'm sorry.

1094
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:35,043
I know.

1095
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:47,222
I want to have it. I do.

1096
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:49,308
Really. I do. I just...

1097
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:55,981
What if I end up being like her?
I don't wanna be like her.

1098
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,033
Hey.

- It could be worse.

1100
01:21:10,746 --> 01:21:12,956
What if I got to be
like your dad?

1101

- [Laughs]
- [Chuckles]

1102
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:21,423
You know I'm a mess.
I'm gonna worry 100% of the time.

1103
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:24,760
[Sniffles]
I'll have to take off work for a while.

1104
01:21:24,843 --> 01:21:28,305
I told you a hundred times
I'd get an extra job.

1105
01:21:28,388 --> 01:21:30,307
And I meant it.

1106
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:32,518
It would help if you
wouldn't be so nice.

1107
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:34,895
[Chuckles]
Let's go ask your parents how nice I am.

1108
01:21:34,978 --> 01:16:51,653
- No. I think we'd better just get out of here.
- Yeah.

1109
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:49,952
Mom.

1110
01:21:52,955 --> 01:21:57,668
I just wanted to say I'm sorry for wrecking
the car and hurting myself the way I did.

1111
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:02,548
<i>I know you had to go
to a lot of extra trouble.</i>

1112
01:22:03,799 --> 01:22:06,134
<i>And I'm sorry this
wedding thing has happened too.</i>

1113
01:22:10,347 --> 01:22:12,933
I know you don't understand.

1114
01:22:13,016 --> 01:22:15,477
<i>I don't expect you to, Mom.</i>

1115
01:22:16,645 --> 01:22:19,815
But I did want you to know
that I was sorry.

1116
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:25,821
[Sniffles]
I don't...

1117
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:30,284
I don't understand how anyone
could choose to be like this. It's just, uh...

1118
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:35,581
It is not to be understood.

1119
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:38,834
I didn't choose this.

1120
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:41,128
I am this.

1121
01:22:41,211 --> 01:22:44,131
<i>Mom, I didn't
choose to be gay.</i>

1122
01:22:44,173 --> 01:22:47,801
Do you think I'd choose to be this different
from everyone else...

1123
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:51,263
that I'd choose to make
you and Dad this upset...

1124
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:55,684
and I'd choose to lose someone
as beautiful and wonderful as Allison?

1125
01:22:55,767 --> 01:22:57,686
And what about AIDS?

1126
01:22:57,769 --> 01:23:00,189
<i>I mean, suppose somebody
wanted to be gay.</i>

1127
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:03,233
Would they want to be gay now?

1128
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:09,364
I don't know.
And I don't want to know.

1129
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:14,828
Then you don't
wanna know me either.

W-W-Wait. Don't hang up.

Uh...

I'm really sorry.

01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,936
And I was calling
to say that... No.

01:25:02,978 --> 01:25:05,189
I'm callin'
from a pay phone.

1137
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:07,900
Well, things are a little nuts
at my house right now.

1138
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:10,152
I'll talk to you about that
later if you want.

01:25:10,235 --> 01:25:13,906
But, uh...

1140
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:16,491
What I was wondering
is if...

1141
01:25:16,575 --> 01:25:19,620
Uh... What I'd
like to know is if...

1142
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:23,373
we could possibly
go for a cup of coffee?

1143
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:25,959
'Cause I really
need to talk to you. Please.

1144

- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

1145
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:48,982
Whatcha doin'?

1146
01:25:49,024 --> 01:25:53,153
Oh, I don't know. Waiting for you
to come home, I guess.

1147
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,990
You didn't have to do that.

1148
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:01,328
Look, you have a son
who almost kills himself...

1149
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:05,165
and then write a book about what you're
supposed to do and how you're supposed to react.

1150
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:08,544
- How about that?
- Sorry.

1151
01:26:08,627 --> 01:26:10,546
Yeah, it's been hard on you.

1152
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:12,881
It's your bad luck to be
born into a family...

1153
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:16,969
where people don't always know
the right thing to do or say.

1154
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:20,180
I got it.

1155
01:26:28,021 --> 01:26:29,940
Homosexual.

1156
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:36,196
There. I said it.

1157
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:40,826
Didn't make me sick or anything.

1158

That's pretty good, Dad.

1159
01:26:45,289 --> 01:26:48,000
I-I think the word, uh,
"gay" is a little easier.

1160
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,335
I don't like that word.

1161
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:53,922
That's a perfectly good word
that's been destroyed, and I don't like it.

1162
01:26:54,006 --> 01:26:56,216
Okay.

1163
01:26:58,427 --> 01:27:02,055
Since I have said the word...

1164
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:04,600
uh, can I ask you
a few questions?

1165
01:27:04,683 --> 01:27:07,394
Because...
I mean, do you mind?

through this properly.

01:27:16,069 --> 01:27:18,947
Okay. Go ahead.

1169
01:27:21,033 --> 01:27:23,452
I mean...

1170
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:27,456
I've been thinking about this
because I've heard it before.

1171
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:29,458
What do you say
about this thing...

1172
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:32,336
about God
hating homosexuals...

1173
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:37,633
about homosexuals being unnatural or...
or going to hell?

1174
01:27:37,716 --> 01:27:39,718
What do you say
about that?

1175
01:27:44,348 --> 01:27:46,433
I don't know.

1176
01:27:46,475 --> 01:27:48,477
I can't tell you, Dad.

1177
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:53,357
Well, I think we should
look into that, don't you?

1178
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:58,946
No, not really.
I don't believe that.

1179
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:02,950
Well, what you believe
isn't factual.

1180
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:07,162
If you go around telling people that
you're a... that you're a homosexual...

1181
01:28:07,246 --> 01:28:09,164
sooner or later,
someone's gonna say this...

1182
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:11,667
and you should know
how to defend yourself.

1183
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,294
<i>That's all I'm saying.</i>

1184
01:28:16,672 --> 01:28:20,467
I'm not thrilled about this, and I don't
want to give you the wrong idea.

1185
01:28:21,927 --> 01:28:24,137
I would rather
you be normal.

1186
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:26,723
I think I am normal.

1187
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:30,185
Don't quibble with me.
You know what I mean.

1188
01:28:30,269 --> 01:28:31,728
Yes, sir.

1189
01:28:36,692 --> 01:28:40,654
But whatever you are,
you're my son.

1190
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:45,617
And l...

1191
01:28:50,455 --> 01:28:52,374
I'm, uh...

1192
01:28:55,794 --> 01:28:57,796
That's all.

1193
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:02,885
You're my son.

1194
01:29:09,892 --> 01:29:12,227
And I don't think
I want people...

1195
01:29:12,311 --> 01:29:16,773
saying things like that
about my son...

1196
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:18,775
without knowing
how to respond.

1197
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:28,785
So we should look into that.

1198
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:40,881
You may not know this,
but Alexander the Great...

1199
01:29:43,008 --> 01:29:46,512
who I happen to think
was a damn good general...

1200
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:52,518
Alexander the Great
