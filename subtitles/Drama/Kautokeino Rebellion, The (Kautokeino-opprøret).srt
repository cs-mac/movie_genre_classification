1 
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,420 
Planet Aradius 

2 
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:11,061 
The Arid people, believers of the Wei, 
have been enslaved and oppressed by humans for over a millennium.

3 
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:13,401 

4 
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:17,893 
In recent years, 
the planet's declining population has become plagued by infertility

6 
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:23,831 
the ruthless human viceroy--Griffin--has begun an unyeilding campagin to find and kill the arid rebel leader--Moss--who speaks of rebellion...

7 
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:28,299 
Arid to the rebel leader, Moss, who speaks 
an uprising, to find and kill ... 

8 
00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:47,080 
Where is Moss? 

9 
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,074 
Where is Moss? 
- Do what you gotta do. 

10 
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:11,059 
Moss. 
- We never betray our people. 

11 
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,562 
Neither do we. My King, such acts 
for those who are suitable for it. 

12 
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:21,869 
Arid or human. 
They must all admire you. 

13 
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,970 
Admired for a short time. 
- Think of the economy. 

14 
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:28,524 
At this moment there are no strong men, 
both work and leisure. 

15 
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,520 
Take him to the pit. 

16 
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:37,960 
Rest assured, I will find Moss ... 

17 
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:41,235 
and if I do, I will destroy him. 

18 
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:44,009 
And his crazy followers.

21 
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,500 
They are close. 

22 
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,800 
Human Rights. 
- I can see. 

23 
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,400 
Hirokin. 

24 
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,500 
It's not like we know each other. 

25 
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000 
These people come to our planet ... 

26 
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,200 
they steal our resources, 
they spread infertility ... 

27 
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:52,700 
among our women. 

28 
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,100 
And what do we do? 

29 
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,400 
We still fight against ... 

30 
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,600 
how long we allow 
Griffin enslaves us ... 

31 
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,450 
for our men to take ... 

32 
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:02,800 
our women to abuse ... 

33 
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,900 
Are we so different from the people? 

34 
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,600 
Because our palms shows our blood? 

35 
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,500 
How is it that some people 
the Arids so warm welcome. 

36 
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,600 
No one is alike. 

37 
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,400 
Wait here. 

38 
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000 
My Lord, what do you want us to do? 

39 
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,200 
And? 

40 
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,600 
With this uranium are your weapons sharp. 

41 
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300 
My people need not be pointed out 
on the properties of their own uranium. 

42 
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,100 
So? 
- I have the solution here. 

43 
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,500 
Deacons. 
- You. 

44 
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,900 
What? 
- I knew we could not trust people. 

45 
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,600 
I did not. 
- Help us. 

46 
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,800 
Kill them all. 

47 
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,300 
My advice to you, run. 

48 
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,500 
Pick the one with the mask, 
then he must withdraw. 

49 
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,100 
If Wood gets the mask in time, 
the rebels will fail. 

50 
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,600 
Yes, sir. 

51 
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:23,701 
Do not touch her, man. 

52 
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,600 
Is everything okay? 
- Yes. 

53 
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400 
What is wrong? 

54 
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,300 
Finley. 

55 
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,800 
That was seven years ago. 

56 
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,200 
I know. 

57 
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,200 
Do you ... 

58 
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,400 
we do not have to do. 

59 
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,900 
I'm back for the first meal. 

60 
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,300 
We came so close ... 

61 
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,100 
we can not turn around. 

62 
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,300 
We are really close to the horde. 

63 
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,100 
Deacons can here everywhere. 

64 
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,700 
We can not go back. 

65 
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,700 
If I can solve this ... 

66 
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,800 
we can go live. 

67 
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,800 
And you will have a future. 

68 
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,300 
A tea. 

69 
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,700 
We all do what we must do. 

70 
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,700 
I heard your name today fall 
in connection with the slaughtering. 

71 
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,900 
Do you believe everything you hear? 

72 
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,200 
Less than half of what I see. 

73 
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,400 
That's not what we had discussed. 

74 
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,249 
This is better. 
- It is not yours to decide. 

75 
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,700 
This is all I have. 

76 
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,100 
Hirokin ... 

77 
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,000 
You're the only one in the neighborhood with the drug. 
- Then you understand its value. 

78 
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,300 
Grace, brother. 

79 
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,900 
Grace. 

80 
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,600 
My child is sick. 

81 
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,700 
She has that medicine. 

82 
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,000 
Those not willing to help 
can not be helped. 

83 
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,300 
I know who you are. 

84 
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,500 
Is that so? 
- How can you be so selfish? 

85 
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,300 
We all do what we must do. 

86 
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,700 
Deacons, get out. 

87 
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,400 
Nora. 

88 
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,000 
Nora. 

89 
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,200 
Ga. 
Go inside. 

90 
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,600 
It is time to exercise 
in practice. 

91 
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,300 
Hurry up please. 

92 
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700 
Complete silence as we had practiced. 

93 
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,900 
Show yourself. 

94 
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,200 
Come on out. 

95 
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,000 
Human Rights. I am a man. 

96 
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,800 
We thought you were vandals 
So we hid. 

97 
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,600 
We want no problems, 
we are just passing through. 

98 
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,500 
Do you have a Arib seen 
named Moss? 

99 
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,100 
No. 

100 
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,800 
I see that they Arids ribbon wearing. 

101 
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,200 
Is it that child birth? 

102 
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,700 
Yes. 

103 
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,600 
We are just passing through. 

104 
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,400 
Let's have a long journey. 

105 
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000 
Which side are you on? 
- East. 

106 
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800 
The food chase. 

107 
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,600 
I have something for you, calm down. 

108 
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,500 
It is at least a hundred gigs worth. 

109 
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600 
Earlier thousand. 

110 
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,900 
Let us go and it's yours. 
- I decide what is mine. 

111 
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,800 
We do not want problems. 

112 
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,600 
Problems? 

113 
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,000 
My friend, anyway. 
You're in a world problem. 

114 
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,800 
Racing. 

115 
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,000 
No. 

116 
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,100 
Take it to the pit. 

117 
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,100 
Maybe he does it better there. 

118 
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,000 
Attention, the games begin 
ten marks. 

119 
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,100 
Attention. 
Place your bets. 

120 
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,500 
The matches start on ten marks. 

121 
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,866 
My daughters. 
This is the last place I wanted to see them. 

122 
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,300 
They want to know what you 
are willing to die. 

123 
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,600 
Keep walking, inside. 
- Come on, faster with those rows. 

124 
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,100 
That is enough. 
Bye, the next one. 

125 
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,100 
Keep walking. 
Here you go. 

126 
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,500 
All right. 
- Here he comes. 

127 
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,800 
There, HONSu. 

128 
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,100 
They say he is a sympathizer. 
- He is a sympathizer? 

129 
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000 
Befriend the rebel leader Moss. 

130 
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,200 
Hey, I got an idea. 

131 
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,300 
We sell him the sword 
that the man brought. 

132 
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,922 
Yes, but what if he lit us again? 

133 
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:54,387 
Simple, whatever he asks, we deliver it. 

134 
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,800 
Beautiful. 
- Note. 

135 
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,300 
And what have the men for me today? 

136 
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:03,302 
A love stick. 

137 
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:06,305 
Attention, the games begin 
five marks. 

138 
00:19:06,306 --> 00:19:07,406 
A gay stick? 

139 
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,500 
Are you going to watch it all day? 

140 
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,000 
It suits you. 

141 
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700 
It really brings your eyes forward. 

142 
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,700 
Two palm woods for this. 

143 
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,100 
Five. 

144 
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,100 
He is worth at least five. 

145 
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:38,500 
Five? 
Really? 

146 
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,600 
What man wants a Arib sword? 
He is way too heavy to use. 

147 
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,900 
No, no, you do not. If you were there 
much interest in, it's worth a lot. 

148 
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,565 
You're going we do not light up again. 

149 
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,700 
You light up? Gentlemen, have you forgotten 
what valuables I brought you? 

150 
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,300 
I remember it. 

151 
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,600 
Yes, that was really nice stuff. 

152 
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,200 
Really nice. 

153 
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,100 
Two. 

154 
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600 
I think two is good. 
Let's take those two. 

155 
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700 
But you wanted four. 
- Yeah, okay ... 

156 
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,500 
but I think two is good. 

157 
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,400 
Two, and then we are equal. 

158 
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,400 
Almost, but why do we ... 

159 
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,100 
this little strap at ... 

160 
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,100 
and we have a deal. 
- Two blue. 

161 
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,600 
Two for two. 

162 
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,700 
Okay, it's a deal. 

163 
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,700 
Is this yours? 

164 
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,700 
They say you have a 
Arid woman and a child protected. 

165 
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,700 
That's right, I said Arid ... 

166 
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,900 
I do not call anyone a gig. 

167 
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,800 
Arids are always better, right? 

168 
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,100 
Then I am in your debt. 

169 
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,300 
I always do. 

170 
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,800 
That keeps me alive. 

171 
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,300 
For a bit of force. 

172 
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,200 
Walk strong in the Wei friend. 

173 
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,300 
Attention, the games begin now. 

174 
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,200 
Civilization has a delicate balance. 

175 
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,100 
It shows what the people want 
and what I need. 

176 
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,900 
And I need stability, 
order and discipline. 

177 
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100 
And for that ... 

178 
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,700 
I give their Orange. 

179 
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,400 
She is very beautiful. 

180 
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,260 
Have you enjoyed last night. 

181 
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,243 
I really enjoyed it. 

182 
00:22:57,797 --> 00:23:01,792 
A good barrel, but empty. 

183 
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,942 
I'm more than a vessel, 
once you understood that. 

184 
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,039 
Anyone with insight could understand that. 

185 
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,902 
Maybe I'm blind. 

186 
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:16,624 
I will give you an heir. 
It's only a matter of time. 

187 
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:20,823 
Obedience to my orders ... 

188 
00:23:20,939 --> 00:23:24,775 
Is my freedom. 
- I am a father of a civilization ... 

189 
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:26,892 
I will not be forgotten. 

190 
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,685 
Hirokin. 

191 
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:58,423 
I will not fight. 
I will not kill other Arid. 

192 
00:23:58,591 --> 00:24:00,241 
Then you will die. 

193 
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:13,724 
Well, you people know the rules. 
Kill your enemies ... 

194 
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:18,115 
and save your loved ones from the point. 

195 
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,092 
I love you. 

196 
00:25:24,181 --> 00:25:26,061 
Impressive. 

197 
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:48,062 
Mama! 
Dad! 

198 
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:54,978 
No! Father! 

199 
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:12,892 
Kore, you say that your man together 
with that whore grabbed it. 

200 
00:27:13,195 --> 00:27:15,143 
And her child. 

201 
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,817 
Let her go. 
- He won the fight, according to the rules ... 

202 
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:27,164 
the woman Fri 
- Indeed. 

203 
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:30,549 
Rules. 
Where would we be without them. 

204 
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:36,202 
Yes, master. 

205 
00:27:39,445 --> 00:27:41,253 
Do not let go. 

206 
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,398 
No, Hirokin, no! 

207 
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:48,223 
Moss and his remaining rebels 
have a low threat. 

208 
00:28:48,324 --> 00:28:50,024 
Find him, Kore. 

209 
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:55,593 
Each underrated invisible enemy. 
- Moss will continue to hide. 

210 
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,204 
Be sure of that, he and his people 
in due time will appear. 

211 
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,405 
So it is. 
- I will find him. 

212 
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:07,006 
Maybe you should just come back 
if you have it. 

213 
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,800 
That would make sense. 

214 
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,579 
As you wish. 

215 
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,773 
My lord. 

216 
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,214 
Death. 

217 
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:26,729 
Death. 
- It's still breathing. 

218 
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,867 
Not any more. 

219 
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,888 
Have you seen that man in the pit? 
- The skinny? 

220 
00:29:35,912 --> 00:29:37,915 
Or that fat. 
- Was there a fat man in the pit? 

221 
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:41,270 
No! Sometimes I do not 
why I'm with you. 

222 
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:43,719 
I like them, if she's a little meat 
to themselves. 

223 
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,513 
What do you like, with "a little meat on them? 

224 
00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:49,131 
People, Arids, it does not matter, 
as long as they show a little flesh to themselves. 

225 
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:54,400 
And what do you do when you're done with them? 
- When I'm done that? 

226 
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:55,952 
With them stabbing death. 

227 
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:57,685 
Wait, what did you 
I was talking about? 

228 
00:29:57,785 --> 00:30:00,148 
I do not know where you're talking about, 
every time you change. 

229 
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:03,907 
First you talking about a skinny man in the pit 
And now you're talking about stabbing death. 

230 
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,056 
It is very confusing. 

231 
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:09,285 
Why? 

232 
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,181 
I do not know. 
- Is he not? 

233 
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:16,124 
He's a bit skinny, right? 
- Yes, he could use some meat on its use. 

234 
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:21,435 
You know what I heard? 
I heard that he was the Arids. 

235 
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:24,810 
And he is a murderer. 
- Killer. 

236 
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,813 
A piece or eleven or something. 

237 
00:30:26,913 --> 00:30:28,568 
They say that he 
Arid has a bunch of rebels slain. 

238 
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,013 
That Griffin will be appreciated it. 

239 
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:34,172 
If you call that appreciation ... 

240 
00:30:34,242 --> 00:30:39,068 
Well, I have him stabbing. 
- Beware, do not stay stuck. 

241 
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:42,990 
Exactly, yes. 
What was that? 

242 
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,007 
That sounded good. 

243 
00:30:56,821 --> 00:31:00,423 
It's good. It is well 
you who live at root, my friend. 

244 
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:03,643 
Otherwise, this' n very one-sided conversation. 

245 
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:07,129 
My boy. 
- No time to grieve. 

246 
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:10,484 
Now it's time to flee. 

247 
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:12,550 
Why are you helping me? 

248 
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:15,365 
We all have our motives. 

249 
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,667 
A friend of mine had a vision. 

250 
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,574 
And I think it was about you. 

251 
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:25,177 
Quick, we must hurry. 

252 
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:56,121 
Good. 
- Where are we? 

253 
00:31:56,722 --> 00:31:58,402 
A half day of the Horde removed. 

254 
00:31:59,972 --> 00:32:02,329 
I'll take you so far back. 

255 
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:06,250 
See that red star? 

256 
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,159 
Stay in the direction of that star walk. 

257 
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,438 
Eventually you will find a friend of mine. 

258 
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:15,960 
His name is Moss. 

259 
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:21,656 
If he managed to escape the Deacons, 
he will help you. 

260 
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:25,524 
Here. 

261 
00:32:29,504 --> 00:32:31,369 
To support you. 

262 
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:40,731 
Walk strong with the Wei, my friend. 

263 
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:33,344 
Is this life worth living? 

264 
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:58,852 
I bet you wish you were dead. 

265 
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:11,920 
He is a man you can not trust him. 
He would not be here. 

266 
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:14,399 
He puts us in danger. 

267 
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:18,169 
We would have to leave him immediately. 
- He needs our help. 

268 
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:20,371 
HONSu him with "a reason sent to us. 

269 
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:22,472 
How do we know this rig 
the medallion has not been stolen. 

270 
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,295 
Maybe he HONSu be killed. 
- There is little danger to help him. 

271 
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:30,296 
Help him bring our tribe in danger. 

272 
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,947 
It brings your daughter in danger. 

273 
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,563 
You need a drink. 

274 
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:45,094 
Here. 

275 
00:35:51,175 --> 00:35:52,395 
Good. 

276 
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:07,824 
Gabriel, go find your father. 

277 
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:17,405 
Water? 

278 
00:37:18,212 --> 00:37:19,810 
Go ahead. 

279 
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:25,567 
We constantly search for water. A tribe sought 
nearly two moons without 'n drop to find. 

280 
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,037 
The water will be coming. 
Because we are strong in the Wei. 

281 
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:32,995 
Come. 

282 
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:37,681 
We grind the thorns, and 'n drugs 
liquid that helps with injuries. 

283 
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:45,957 
See? Look. 

284 
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:50,314 
This is how the Arid itself. 

285 
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:54,980 
If, in a part of the system rooted. 
In order to keep together the whole. 

286 
00:37:56,362 --> 00:37:58,692 
Maren. Water. 

287 
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:02,948 
See? 

288 
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:16,063 
Our thoughts, our words. 
Our words ... 

289 
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:23,056 
our words, our actions. 
Our actions were our habits. 

290 
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:29,086 
Our habits, our values. 

291 
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,711 
Our values ??... 

292 
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:40,696 
our values, our destination. 

293 
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:45,358 
Moss, what you ask us, is suicide. 

294 
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:48,573 
The renegade will not save a single soul. 

295 
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:51,061 
It will only show a matter of time, 
before they find us. 

296 
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:53,649 
Time. 

297 
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,517 
We must unite as a tribe, Cain. 

298 
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:04,193 
If we do not like a candle 
want to be blown. 

299 
00:39:04,406 --> 00:39:10,122 
You can not save everyone. 
- The tribes will unite with Dead Rock. 

300 
00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:17,213 
Has your own life for meaning 
when nobody else is ... 

301 
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:19,233 
for the light to communicate? 

302 
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:23,155 
And what is the meaning of death? 

303 
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:42,731 
He will give us the first chance 
he gets, revealing as a reward. 

304 
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,728 
I trust that you keep an eye on him. 
And Maren also. 

305 
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:03,968 
Homemade liquor with spines. 

306 
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,183 
But a few tribes make it. 

307 
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,580 
We trade it for what we need. 

308 
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:26,661 
It tastes terrible. 

309 
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:30,810 
But it frees you from your problems. 

310 
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:44,026 
We have saved your life, 
the least you can do is talk. 

311 
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:55,781 
Yes, Maren, I appreciate the 
what your tribe did for me. 

312 
00:40:55,881 --> 00:40:57,332 
What is your band? 

313 
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,825 
I am the second oldest daughter of my tribe. 

314 
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:05,966 
Goodness gracious! 
I thought you were much older. 

315 
00:41:07,603 --> 00:41:10,809 
Thanks for the drink spiked. 
I really enjoyed it. 

316 
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:21,124 
Good night Maren. 

317 
00:41:22,955 --> 00:41:25,964 
Second oldest daughter of our tribe. 

318 
00:41:49,543 --> 00:41:51,406 
Maren. 

319 
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,746 
I missed you last night in singing. 
- I also missed the singing. 

320 
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,277 
I must help him, Cain. 

321 
00:42:03,893 --> 00:42:06,608 
Help him or help us? 

322 
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:09,135 
Maybe it's the same. 
- I wish ... 

323 
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:15,327 
that things were simple, Maren. 
But life is never. 

324 
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:33,128 
Beautiful, is not it? 

325 
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:37,291 
I do not know, it feels cold. 

326 
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,290 
Lonely. 

327 
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:43,281 
Amazing how such a small thing 
many may determine. 

328 
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,373 
Some say the lines 
tell our future. 

329 
00:42:46,754 --> 00:42:48,623 
Does that mean I have no future? 

330 
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:52,967 
I can not go a day longer life. 

331 
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:56,737 
To the outside world. 
None Arid, not man. 

332 
00:42:57,306 --> 00:42:59,170 
I mean, who are we? 

333 
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:00,810 
We are in the outside world, 
because we do not belong. 

334 
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,611 
You chose this life, not me. 

335 
00:43:14,355 --> 00:43:17,579 
Audowen? 
- They bleed. 

336 
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,232 
She is bleeding everywhere. 

337 
00:43:37,378 --> 00:43:40,438 
Please, my baby. 

338 
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:43,759 
Here is the baby. 

339 
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:01,921 
Audowen? 

340 
00:44:03,231 -> 00:44:05,640 
Audowen? 

341 
00:45:18,743 --> 00:45:19,943 
Each ribbon a song. 

342 
00:45:21,656 --> 00:45:23,963 
A ribbon for every life 
what we are blessed. 

343 
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:31,485 
Blessed. Even in death there is life. 

344 
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:10,298 
Moss is near. 

345 
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,113 
I leave at dawn. 

346 
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:40,615 
Go back to your Horde? 

347 
00:46:46,091 --> 00:46:46,951 
Why? 

348 
00:46:47,797 --> 00:46:50,593 
Revenge. 
- The senseless revenge. 

349 
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:55,781 
Why people do not understand 
that we all breathe the same air? 

350 
00:46:57,707 --> 00:46:59,097 
We drink the same water. 

351 
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:01,098 
We cry the same tears. 

352 
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:04,585 
I've seen, my friend. 

353 
00:47:05,732 --> 00:47:09,963 
I've seen ... 
on the battlefield of my mind. 

354 
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:13,714 
You are sent to the tribes to unite. 

355 
00:47:15,134 --> 00:47:17,100 
I'm not the answer you're looking for. 

356 
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:20,775 
Am I crazy? 

357 
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:26,061 
The Wei have brought him here. 

358 
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,437 
Much suffering comes with believing in the Wei. 

359 
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:36,665 
Suffering, what do you now suffer? 

360 
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:44,197 
It is our tribe, which is haunted. 

361 
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:47,271 
Like the night follows the day ... 

362 
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,743 
it's coming, my friend. 

363 
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:52,811 
No hope ... 

364 
00:47:53,869 --> 00:48:00,286 
You can change it, 
the world ... 

365 
00:48:01,623 --> 00:48:07,489 
My friend, stay with us and learn our trade. 
- No, thank you. 

366 
00:48:07,524 --> 00:48:13,356 
No hope and no change 
unless you unite the tribes. 

367 
00:48:14,198 --> 00:48:16,360 
No, thank you. 

368 
00:48:41,297 --> 00:48:43,074 
Maren. 

369 
00:48:43,558 --> 00:48:47,916 
Clothing to keep you cool, 
there is more than you need. 

370 
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:55,752 
Nothing kills our spirit. 

371 
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:02,614 
Cain? 
- Cain clings too tightly. 

372 
00:49:02,972 --> 00:49:04,742 
Sometimes you something to cling 
all you can do. 

373 
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:07,802 
What you can do is accept the truth 
and release. 

374 
00:49:08,093 --> 00:49:09,443 
How do you do that? 

375 
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:13,740 
You just do. 

376 
00:49:36,694 --> 00:49:38,206 
It's time for me to leave. 

377 
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:45,836 
I'm getting old by depression. 

378 
00:49:46,742 --> 00:49:52,193 
Hirokin. 
That's what your name means in the old city. 

379 
00:49:52,774 --> 00:49:54,162 
Held. 

380 
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:59,819 
He who fights for more than himself. 

381 
00:50:00,468 --> 00:50:02,920 
I fight for them. 
- They are dead. 

382 
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:07,851 
They are now free. 

383 
00:50:09,264 --> 00:50:11,930 
But that's not me. 
- No, not you. 

384 
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:14,969 
Not until the Griffin dead. 

385 
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,772 
The Griffin will 
your limbs torn apart. 

386 
00:50:18,937 --> 00:50:20,779 
Let me see it. 

387 
00:50:23,344 --> 00:50:24,887 
Do you think it is a game? 

388 
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:28,012 
Come, put your hand up. 

389 
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:30,938 
Let's play. 

390 
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,741 
Push me over. Do your best. 

391 
00:50:46,771 --> 00:50:50,922 
Nice is not it? This game. 

392 
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:05,004 
What was that? 

393 
00:51:05,946 --> 00:51:09,606 
I call not a massacre. 

394 
00:51:09,641 --> 00:51:10,805 
You're not ready. 

395 
00:51:15,391 --> 00:51:17,349 
Stop. Hold on. 

396 
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:20,397 
Show it to me. 
- What should I show you. 

397 
00:51:25,976 --> 00:51:28,349 
I will not leave my sheep, 
like a wolf. 

398 
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:48,622 
Until you learn the secrets of the Wei ... 

399 
00:51:48,657 --> 00:51:51,766 
you're just a slaughter 
Grif for Finnish gang. 

400 
00:51:55,552 --> 00:51:58,142 
You're not ready. 

401 
00:52:06,785 --> 00:52:12,090 
She was your wife ... is not it? 
You wonder why you could not save her. 

402 
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,518 
Accept, the Wei. 

403 
00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:32,658 
I can tell you 
that suffered by the Wei. 

404 
00:52:33,386 --> 00:52:37,032 
When I turn, there is a fatherless child 
because you loved Wei. 

405 
00:52:37,278 --> 00:52:40,708 
Do not turn around so it means for you 
what you think it means. 

406 
00:52:41,012 --> 00:52:44,624 
Yes ... 
Yes, that is the fire. 

407 
00:52:49,539 --> 00:52:53,051 
The power of imagination, my friend ... 

408 
00:52:53,792 --> 00:52:55,698 
is a powerful tool. 

409 
00:52:56,458 --> 00:53:01,372 
Do me a favor, imagine a leaf. 
Think of a jasmine leaf. 

410 
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:06,751 
Do it for me ... 

411 
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:16,664 
Do your best, it is important to visualize 
I'm going to tell you so. 

412 
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,923 
We have a huge connection Arids 
with the world around us. 

413 
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:26,055 
The air, land, 
these are the foundations ... 

414 
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:32,178 
This is the Wei. 
It is no coincidence that the Arids believe in this. 

415 
00:53:32,499 --> 00:53:36,041 
Our visual side 
is quite different from the human. 

416 
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,224 
It is fully connected to our environment. 

417 
00:53:40,937 --> 00:53:46,210 
A millennium ago, there was an elite group 
so connected with reality ... 

418 
00:53:46,245 --> 00:53:50,389 
that they were able to 
ontraffelen times. 

419 
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:54,533 
Decisions were seen 
for they were made. 

420 
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:58,724 
This special gift made 
the people are terrified ... 

421 
00:53:58,725 --> 00:54:02,285 
A campaign was started 
for us to eradicate. 

422 
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,863 
All knowledge of our gift was wiped out. 

423 
00:54:06,564 --> 00:54:09,407 
After a thousand years of 
slavery and genocide ... 

424 
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:12,285 
the Arid varieties forget who we are. 

425 
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,750 
See the future was a myth. 
The scorched planet ... 

426 
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:21,215 
made our women infertile. 

427 
00:54:21,377 --> 00:54:26,188 
We are the light, 
it's not beyond. 

428 
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:30,999 
But it is in here. 
It flows out to the world. 

429 
00:54:31,324 --> 00:54:34,255 
So who are you? 

430 
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:39,130 
A man. 

431 
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:44,063 
Have you not known, 
I am able to read your thoughts? 

432 
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:50,237 
I am able to feel your connection 
since the day we took you from the desert. 

433 
00:54:50,841 --> 00:54:54,577 
You were born in this world, 
not quite human and not quite Arid. 

434 
00:54:54,904 --> 00:54:58,106 
Your association with the Wei ... 

435 
00:54:58,544 --> 00:55:01,846 
is the strongest I have ever encountered. 

436 
00:55:02,250 -> 00:55:07,005 
If you follow me in my mind ... 

437 
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:12,336 
do you go along with the flow 
or you fight against me? 

438 
00:55:16,642 --> 00:55:19,375 
Amazing 
something so small that many can identify. 

439 
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:25,251 
I handle it. 
- No, you will not. This is who you are. 

440 
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:28,849 
You shame haunts you. 

441 
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,628 
Let it go. 

442 
00:55:34,004 --> 00:55:37,260 
We create our own reality, my friend. 

443 
00:55:37,811 --> 00:55:40,598 
Reality creates us. 

444 
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:44,380 
That is useful. 
- Convenient? 

445 
00:55:45,035 --> 00:55:49,293 
Do you? 

446 
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:53,680 
That boy ... 

447 
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,436 
these are just memories now. 

448 
00:56:03,632 --> 00:56:07,421 
I tried everything I am. 

449 
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,752 
But I could not ... 

450 
00:56:12,982 --> 00:56:18,156 
I could not ... 
I could not save him. 

451 
00:56:32,037 --> 00:56:33,970 
You are what you create, right? 

452 
00:56:35,565 --> 00:56:38,263 
The light hiding inside you. 

453 
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:41,649 
Let it flow. 

454 
00:56:45,422 --> 00:56:51,893 
For the times to unfold 
let all your fears, emotions and thoughts. 

455 
00:56:52,984 --> 00:56:57,565 
That is Wei. 
Start times to see ... 

456 
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:02,962 
See selections. 

457 
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:18,991 
Allow your senses to move forward, 
hear the sounds. 

458 
00:57:19,844 --> 00:57:22,715 
Belief in a choice without a doubt. 

459 
00:57:27,676 --> 00:57:30,943 
That faith and that choice ... 

460 
00:57:32,117 --> 00:57:34,505 
will it really make. 
It's all in your mind. 

461 
00:57:34,969 --> 00:57:38,005 
You just need the pieces in a fit. 

462 
00:57:45,431 --> 00:57:51,240 
Your vision creates your reality. 

463 
00:58:01,127 --> 00:58:02,374 
You let him leave? 

464 
00:58:04,101 --> 00:58:05,447 
The time has come. 

465 
00:58:07,007 --> 00:58:11,073 
I go with him. 
- That's a dead weight between two suns. 

466 
00:58:17,009 --> 00:58:19,204 
If you go to the Griffin, take me along. 

467 
00:58:25,366 --> 00:58:29,517 
Give me your hand. 

468 
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,036 
Give it. 

469 
00:58:43,743 --> 00:58:46,145 
Care for your tribe, that's what matters. 

470 
00:59:37,598 --> 00:59:42,798 
Attention, place your bet. 
The matches start on five landmarks. 

471 
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:49,718 
They can not give you what you desire. 

472 
00:59:49,955 --> 00:59:51,703 
Can you do that? 

473 
01:00:00,925 --> 01:00:04,625 
Attention, place your bet. 
The games begin ... 

474 
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:08,034 
I hope you find this enjoyable 
than the last time. 

475 
01:00:22,597 --> 01:00:24,857 
I enjoy nothing 
than the sight of my son. 

476 
01:00:31,816 --> 01:00:36,455 
You're so beautiful, Tara. 
I mean in your conviction. 

477 
01:01:24,044 --> 01:01:26,383 
You would not be here. 

478 
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:32,155 
Your father ... 
- Is happy when I return with a good deal. 

479 
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:15,267 
Commander, we have reported that Moss had 
and his rebels gather at Dead Rock '. 

480 
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:19,707 
Prima Deacon, sets sail from 
and send message to the viceroy. 

481 
01:02:48,521 --> 01:02:51,096 
The mind has its own place ... 

482 
01:02:51,382 --> 01:02:54,925 
only he can enjoy 
a torture to convert. 

483 
01:02:55,142 --> 01:02:56,688 
Or a torture fun. 

484 
01:02:58,746 --> 01:03:00,714 
And a prison into a sanctuary. 

485 
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:06,520 
A sanctuary or a prison. 

486 
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:10,635 
Where is my son? 
- Stay nice now. 

487 
01:03:10,699 --> 01:03:13,691 
Why am I here? 
- I want a child ... 

488 
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,454 
And you want a better life. 

489 
01:03:18,457 --> 01:03:20,581 
We are a gift for each other. 

490 
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:24,082 
Perhaps undeserved. 

491 
01:03:25,206 --> 01:03:28,743 
We are not so different you and me. 
We both have needs. 

492 
01:03:29,868 --> 01:03:32,912 
I want you by my side today. 

493 
01:03:35,337 --> 01:03:39,052 
He will be there. 
Yes, your son. 

494 
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,247 
Join me with a smile 
and you get what you desire. 

495 
01:03:46,388 --> 01:03:49,428 
Well, then ... 

496 
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:11,803 
Hirokin ... 
Is it true what they say about you? 

497 
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,515 
In the City of Love? 

498 
01:04:22,537 --> 01:04:24,925 
Yes. 

499 
01:04:27,149 --> 01:04:29,670 
Innocent Blood. 

500 
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:10,197 
Where can we find your friend? 
- That we do not, he will find us. 

501 
01:05:11,105 --> 01:05:16,222 
Look. - The man from the Pit. 
He clearly has more meat on the bones. 

502 
01:05:16,257 --> 01:05:19,547 
What ails you? 
- Hold on, Sean, why no other disguise? 

503 
01:05:20,355 --> 01:05:23,467 
What do you mean disguise, wearing a cloak. 
He is a meat eater like you. 

504 
01:05:24,702 --> 01:05:27,498 
I wonder what he wants? 
Probably swap? 

505 
01:05:30,465 --> 01:05:35,568 
This is his so Moss Arid rebels. 
A child and a man. 

506 
01:05:35,786 --> 01:05:37,607 
HONSu. 

507 
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:42,365 
I bet he drinks it. 
- I love how you think, my friend. 

508 
01:05:43,016 --> 01:05:46,968 
Is your father completely mad? 
- My father is fine, thank you. 

509 
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,461 
Have you already met Hirokin? 
- Yes ... 

510 
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:53,020 
the fighter where I did my best for 
to get him out of here. 

511 
01:05:53,772 --> 01:05:55,227 
Welcome back. 

512 
01:05:55,844 --> 01:05:57,460 
Can you bring me near 
of the Viceroy? 

513 
01:05:57,785 --> 01:05:59,178 
The viceroy? 

514 
01:05:59,811 --> 01:06:01,089 
You? 

515 
01:06:01,342 --> 01:06:03,147 
To his legions? 

516 
01:06:06,219 --> 01:06:08,464 
Come, follow me. 

517 
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:58,055 
There is nothing so satisfying 
the quest of the innocent. 

518 
01:06:59,977 --> 01:07:01,762 
I have brought you this. 

519 
01:07:03,843 --> 01:07:09,778 
It's incredibly sweet 
So naturally I thought of you. 

520 
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:15,908 
Indeed very sweet. 

521 
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:24,626 
I will not admit him. 

522 
01:07:35,306 --> 01:07:39,535 
You have no other choice. 

523 
01:07:41,063 --> 01:07:43,061 
Nobody has that. 

524 
01:08:02,734 --> 01:08:04,984 
I'm sorry I can not 
another route can bring. 

525 
01:08:16,489 --> 01:08:19,046 
Only one may enter. 

526 
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:46,314 
Not what you expected? 
- I do not know what I expected. 

527 
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:58,036 
One thing is certain, you are here for her. 
The question is, you have something interesting for me? 

528 
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:00,602 
I am in no mood for games. 

529 
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:08,878 
Griffin is not an easy man 
to participate in the vicinity. 

530 
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:14,036 
Your have succeeded. 
- Yes, indeed. For now. 

531 
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:30,618 
Griffin has needed an heir. 
He thinks I do not give. 

532 
01:09:34,066 --> 01:09:36,226 
I think the problem is beyond us. 

533 
01:09:39,143 --> 01:09:46,055 
Take me to him and it does not matter anymore. 
- Tell me now that you do not want? 

534 
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:47,088 
It can be fun. 

535 
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,340 
The chains cut deep. 

536 
01:10:00,832 --> 01:10:04,735 
I thought you were already familiar look. 
Quite touching how you fought to save her. 

537 
01:10:07,885 --> 01:10:12,543 
I once had a baby. 
Rather, I once gave birth to. 

538 
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:19,226 
I'm sorry. 
- Griffin will now leave the pit. 

539 
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:21,949 
With Tara. 

540 
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:25,567 
You did not? 

541 
01:10:25,936 --> 01:10:30,649 
Tara is still very much alive. 
I see you've already found a replacement. 

542 
01:10:31,072 --> 01:10:33,673 
A younger girl, much prettier. 
- She's alive. 

543 
01:10:36,849 --> 01:10:38,815 
Why do you look yourself? 

544 
01:11:16,485 --> 01:11:17,752 
Deacon. 

545 
01:11:23,966 --> 01:11:26,586 
My son. 
My dear, dear son. 

546 
01:11:27,328 --> 01:11:30,748 
I missed you. 
I love you so much. 

547 
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:02,331 
My prince of the Horde. 

548 
01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:14,197 
So you revolt. 

549 
01:13:16,318 --> 01:13:20,614 
Maybe it's our fault, maybe we were 
not strong enough in the Wei. 

550 
01:13:21,748 --> 01:13:25,265 
Look around you. 
Your stupid wisdom ... 

551 
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:29,167 
kills our people. 
- There is nothing ... 

552 
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:32,239 
fool ... 

553 
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,902 
struggling for freedom. 

554 
01:13:36,889 --> 01:13:39,057 
If you can win. 

555 
01:13:40,009 --> 01:13:43,164 
But you can not? 
So why not live? 

556 
01:13:43,684 --> 01:13:49,666 
With how it is now rather 
resist and kill us one by one. 

557 
01:13:52,582 --> 01:13:57,178 
You see the world 
through the eyes of fear. 

558 
01:13:57,278 --> 01:14:00,039 
And you see nothing. 

559 
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:07,632 
We are not afraid of the path 
that lies ahead. 

560 
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:15,892 
Child prostitutes. 
- Halo extra, you get them a lot fresher. 

561 
01:14:18,293 --> 01:14:20,402 
What do you want? 
- Which? 

562 
01:14:23,698 --> 01:14:27,388 
Grace, Brother. 
Grace. 

563 
01:14:30,283 --> 01:14:35,673 
I am not afraid 
for the path I have chosen. 

564 
01:14:36,398 --> 01:14:38,315 
We are not afraid. 

565 
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:10,185 
Take him away. 

566 
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,637 
A bit dramatic, no? 
- Can you see he has talent. 

567 
01:15:49,205 --> 01:15:52,216 
Keep the whore against children. 
She escapes. 

568 
01:16:04,851 --> 01:16:07,943 
And then it starts. 

569 
01:16:09,873 --> 01:16:11,507 
Subtle. 

570 
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:13,968 
Good throw. 
- I like him. 

571 
01:16:14,586 --> 01:16:18,344 
I find that quite provocative. 
- And now? 

572 
01:16:23,467 --> 01:16:26,754 
Flights. 
- Good plan. 

573 
01:16:30,005 --> 01:16:32,357 
I think ... 
- That this way comes? 

574 
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:34,903 
Problems. 
- Someone's in trouble. 

575 
01:16:40,341 --> 01:16:42,298 
Gentlemen, 
we must flee. 

576 
01:16:42,509 --> 01:16:44,164 
Arab liqueur. 
- And Blue tea. 

577 
01:16:44,509 --> 01:16:46,319 
This way. 
- It's our smuggling route. 

578 
01:16:46,419 --> 01:16:47,619 
If it works. 

579 
01:17:01,769 --> 01:17:07,972 
Have you seen three rebels? 
- They went that way. 

580 
01:17:14,182 --> 01:17:15,858 
Do you know who rebel? 

581 
01:17:17,937 --> 01:17:20,199 
You have the habit 
foreigners to attract. 

582 
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,983 
He is the father. 

583 
01:17:26,164 --> 01:17:29,563 
He survived. 
- You start to sound scared, Viceroy. 

584 
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:31,988 
You begin to disappoint me, 
Tara. 

585 
01:17:32,088 --> 01:17:34,489 
Let my son go. 
- Where? 

586 
01:17:34,589 --> 01:17:36,464 
The desert? 
To disappear? 

587 
01:17:36,564 --> 01:17:38,571 
To join the rebels to join 
and being slaughtered? 

588 
01:17:38,671 --> 01:17:41,169 
Nora needs protection. 
I'll keep him safe. 

589 
01:17:42,036 --> 01:17:43,979 
I love you safe. 

590 
01:17:51,721 --> 01:17:55,243 
Let my son free 
and I will submit. 

591 
01:17:55,913 --> 01:17:58,742 
I need much more than subjugation. 

592 
01:18:06,568 --> 01:18:10,734 
Rebellion, rebellion. The chosen one 
has come to overthrow the Horde. 

593 
01:18:11,123 --> 01:18:14,128 
The tribes gather at Pilot Rock. 

594 
01:18:18,468 --> 01:18:23,549 
All tribes unite. 
The chosen one has come to the Horde to defeat. 

595 
01:18:23,649 --> 01:18:25,868 
Everyone goes to Pilot Rock. 

596 
01:18:39,432 --> 01:18:42,731 
They say a man 
Deacons twenty killed with a sword. 

597 
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,897 
Face forward. 
He was flushed with blood. 

598 
01:19:03,997 --> 01:19:07,428 
Every movement timed to perfection. 

599 
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:12,805 
He came to a man to confront. 
But he painted fate. 

600 
01:19:36,218 --> 01:19:37,747 
This is subtle. 

601 
01:19:38,257 --> 01:19:41,130 
I have some with finesse. 
- You've certainly. 

602 
01:19:47,017 --> 01:19:50,283 
We understand that a human rebel 
The Horde has attacked. 

603 
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:55,052 
And that Arids gather around the rebel. 
- It does not matter. 

604 
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:57,990 
The resistance is the threat. 

605 
01:19:58,266 --> 01:20:03,006 
Moss, without the divided. 
He remains our goal. 

606 
01:20:03,292 --> 01:20:05,781 
Moss is the key to this rebellion. 

607 
01:20:31,063 --> 01:20:33,172 
Cain, 
that you? 

608 
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:38,843 
We all have to choose 
at a given moment, is not it? 

609 
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:56,155 
Spare my people. 
- The Viceroy want you. 

610 
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:58,346 
Alive. 

611 
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:01,376 
Only you. 
- That was not the deal. 

612 
01:21:01,768 --> 01:21:06,060 
You said you would hurt anyone else. 
Moss is the one you want, he's the threat. 

613 
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,901 
Take him. 
- You're lucky you live. 

614 
01:21:15,406 --> 01:21:18,458 
Cain. 
- On your knees, rebel. 

615 
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:47,260 
It's our people become today. 

616 
01:21:48,426 --> 01:21:50,995 
Because of you. 

617 
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:56,565 
They join with us all now. 

618 
01:21:57,466 --> 01:21:59,793 
No more hiding. 

619 
01:22:02,513 --> 01:22:06,365 
Father was right. 
Our vision is our reality. 

620 
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:12,801 
I'm sorry. 

621 
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,928 
They're still alive. 
That's it. 

622 
01:22:23,108 --> 01:22:28,862 
Time to let go. 
Time to plan. 

623 
01:22:30,392 --> 01:22:33,940 
I do not want another child 
his knees by them. 

624 
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:44,479 
Why me? 

625 
01:22:47,107 --> 01:22:50,717 
I am because of you 
and you because of me. 

626 
01:22:52,146 --> 01:22:57,158 
I do not understand. 
And I do not try. 

627 
01:22:57,756 --> 01:23:02,471 
That is Wei. 
We accept just who it is. 

628 
01:23:14,943 --> 01:23:20,894 
You do not like me? 
- That I do. 

629 
01:23:21,338 --> 01:23:25,316 
You're beautiful ... 

630 
01:23:27,027 --> 01:23:29,203 
and ... 

631 
01:23:31,531 --> 01:23:34,616 
I can not. 
- Why? 

632 
01:23:35,935 --> 01:23:38,600 
Because I am Arid? 

633 
01:23:40,551 --> 01:23:43,608 
Because I am bound. 

634 
01:23:44,933 --> 01:23:47,659 
I will be 
for a long time. 

635 
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:58,812 
Then I will wait. 
On you. 

636 
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:06,762 
We arrived just another group. 
- And Moss? 

637 
01:24:27,802 --> 01:24:34,063 
Let it be known that this man 
or resistance within the walls of the Horde ... 

638 
01:24:34,355 --> 01:24:41,937 
will become known as Hirokin, 
Sword of the resistance. 

639 
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:47,716 
We are here to fight alongside you. 
Under your command. 

640 
01:24:48,421 --> 01:24:50,605 
Stand up. 

641 
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:00,181 
Ever ... 

642 
01:25:01,703 --> 01:25:04,531 
I fought, 
because I had nothing to live for. 

643 
01:25:06,863 --> 01:25:12,586 
Now I fight ... 
because I've seen everything to die for. 

644 
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:17,345 
We have a chance ... 

645 
01:25:17,918 --> 01:25:22,845 
to do what Moss said we would do. 

646 
01:25:23,068 --> 01:25:25,898 
Shape, for the people. 

647 
01:25:26,826 --> 01:25:31,086 
We fight for Moss' vision, 
of a united world. 

648 
01:25:31,186 --> 01:25:33,883 
For Moss. 
- For Moss. 

649 
01:25:39,819 --> 01:25:45,815 
When is that big fight start? 
- We attack at dawn. 

650 
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:56,211 
Your rebel starts to irritate me. 

651 
01:25:56,449 --> 01:26:00,600 
I have people 
I have his son, I'm his wife. 

652 
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,539 
And yet he 
still not attacked. 

653 
01:26:17,164 --> 01:26:19,207 
You did not. 

654 
01:26:36,854 --> 01:26:39,059 
Viceroy? 
- Not now. 

655 
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:42,545 
Something very important. 

656 
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:47,756 
Hold that thought. 

657 
01:27:01,438 --> 01:27:05,714 
Want to see what opposing 
the Viceroy you deliver? 

658 
01:27:21,225 --> 01:27:25,208 
It is better to rule in war, 
than to serve in peace. 

659 
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:28,289 
Well done, Kore. 

660 
01:27:33,901 --> 01:27:37,653 
The mighty Moss, 
leader of the rebellion gig. 

661 
01:27:38,268 --> 01:27:44,438 
Broken. 
- You will never break our spirit. 

662 
01:27:44,538 --> 01:27:49,744 
Resistance to the last breath. 
- This is our way. 

663 
01:27:49,862 --> 01:27:54,044 
You still have the power 
to preserve the lives of your pathetic people. 

664 
01:27:56,999 --> 01:28:02,868 
Only in death begins freedom. 

665 
01:28:03,728 --> 01:28:06,389 
For it will come ... 

666 
01:28:07,607 --> 01:28:09,501 
and he ... 

667 
01:28:11,194 --> 01:28:16,601 
will spread apart to the time 
and you will be blown away as a breath ... 

668 
01:28:16,701 --> 01:28:17,901 
Griffin. 

669 
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:25,087 
You fool. 
Now is the death of your people, your fault. 

670 
01:28:26,041 --> 01:28:28,199 
Keep him alive, Kore. 

671 
01:28:29,014 --> 01:28:35,272 
Let him witness his 
latest achievement in his glorious life. 

672 
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:57,142 
What is the key to our success, 
Kore. 

673 
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:02,463 
Timing, My Lord. 
- Timing. 

674 
01:30:03,196 --> 01:30:05,888 
You did not think we were ready for you. 

675 
01:30:10,536 --> 01:30:13,554 
No. 
- What is it you want? 

676 
01:30:13,779 --> 01:30:18,260 
You. Death. 
- Think about it. 

677 
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:23,606 
Because at the end of your life 
you will be reminded of this moment. 

678 
01:30:24,989 --> 01:30:28,152 
We choose life, 
without fear. 

679 
01:30:28,487 --> 01:30:29,889 
Without you. 

680 
01:30:30,211 --> 01:30:33,682 
But you find yourself not 
in a position to make demands. 

681 
01:30:33,782 --> 01:30:36,617 
Not? 

682 
01:30:37,511 --> 01:30:41,788 
He is arrogant. 
- He's dead. 

683 
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:56,698 
Great fights ... 
define great people. 

684 
01:31:00,211 --> 01:31:01,770 
Kill them all. 

685 
01:31:22,767 --> 01:31:26,414 
What are you doing? 
- We will play little war. 

686 
01:31:47,223 --> 01:31:50,224 
They are quite determined. 
- It's who they are. 

687 
01:32:28,635 --> 01:32:30,710 
Relax. 
This will not last long. 

688 
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:25,830 
Keep the child quiet. 

689 
01:35:26,677 --> 01:35:30,190 
In obedience to your command. 
- He is your freedom. 

690 
01:35:51,606 --> 01:35:53,753 
Love playing children. 

691 
01:35:59,246 --> 01:36:00,648 
Let him. 

692 
01:36:14,707 --> 01:36:20,753 
Your vision creates your reality. 
That's the way Sentient. 

693 
01:36:21,047 --> 01:36:23,192 
Not true, Moss? 

694 
01:36:23,292 --> 01:36:28,135 
Moss here dreaming of peace. 
But look around. 

695 
01:36:28,381 --> 01:36:32,325 
A strong desire to own 
extend over the weak. 

696 
01:36:32,872 --> 01:36:34,627 
That is reality. 

697 
01:36:34,757 --> 01:36:38,785 
That is the Wei of my world. 

698 
01:39:41,807 --> 01:39:44,340 
Promise me ... 

699 
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:48,079 
that you let your mother. 

700 
01:39:49,721 --> 01:39:53,301 
I promise. 
- It's your family. 

701 
01:40:05,727 --> 01:40:08,664 
Fight for me. 

702 
01:40:21,887 --> 01:40:25,872 
Loss of love makes heroes. 

703 
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,966 
Each ribbon a song left 
in the fight for freedom. 

704 
01:40:32,614 --> 01:40:34,885 
Yesterday I had a dream. 

705 
01:40:35,312 --> 01:40:40,381 
I saw a man fight 
for something bigger and himself. 

706 
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:45,592 
For freedom. 
He stands against fear. 

707 
01:40:45,917 --> 01:40:50,107 
And tyranny. 
And the next. 

708 
01:40:50,714 --> 01:40:56,981 
Everyone was born free. 
What a dream.
