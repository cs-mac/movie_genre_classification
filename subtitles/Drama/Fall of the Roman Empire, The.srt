00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,700
My hardworking kiddo... Looks like
I made you cry. I'm sorry.

<i>Episode 9</i>

4
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,440
Seo Yoon!

5
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:43,280
I... just got a call from the hospital.

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,170
Father... is in critical condition.

7
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,910
Sung Jae, call Won Jae.
I'll head out first.

8
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,600
Seven years ago... when you
had your brain surgery...

9
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,200
I prayed all night

10
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,700
that your surgery would be successful...
that you'd live longer.

11
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,870
I wasn't ready for it...
what if you'd just leave...

12
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,210
I was worried.

13
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:18,280
But... now it's okay for you to leave.

14
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,100
Thank you for your gift...

15
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,270
the shares of Sung Jin Cement.

16
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,560
Won Jae will flee overseas.

17
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,500
Do you remember?

18
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,440
You made my husband's brother
run away overseas.

19
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,380
Be careful. The vase might fall.

20
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,710
If Jung Yoon becomes empty-handed,
greedy Dong Hui will divorce her.

21
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,950
My husband's sister got a divorce
after Chung Ma Construction fell apart.

22
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,620
Then she suffered from alcoholism
and died a few years after.

23
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,210
Don't touch... Seo Yoon.

24
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,630
Thanks to you, his brother went
to prison for five years.

25
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,850
Don't worry.

26
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,300
Since Seo Yoon is still young, she can
endure a few years in prison.

27
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,600
Don't blame me.

28
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm just reciprocating exactly what
you did to my husband.

29
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,830
For a such a suspicious man...
how did you get so completely fooled?

30
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:24,450
Sung Jae... I taught him since he was little.

31
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,110
I taught him to like your favorite dishes.

32
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,290
Prepare the pickles that he likes, too.

33
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,530
Sung Jae is not the only one who likes it.

34
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,050
Even our favorite dishes are the same.

35
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,370
Your habits, your practices...

36
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,830
I taught him every day again and again.

37
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,810
Don't take after my personality,
your mom will be worried.

38
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,950
I told him to say only the things you like

39
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,980
and I told him not to go against your wishes.

40
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,440
I'll stop horseback riding.

41
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,280
Aren't you proud of my Sung Jae?

42
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,220
What to do...

43
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
The man who used to move
the world with one hand...

44
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,130
can't even move it any more.

45
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,410
He was the same way, too.

46
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,820
He collapsed in front of the door...

47
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,040
He used to be healthy, but he was in bed
for a week then he left this world.

48
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,790
Don't leave yet!
I still have things to say.

49
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,670
I'm sending you off from this life...

50
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:08,740
and my husband will come pick
you up from the after-life.

51
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,720
Tell him for me...

52
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,470
that I've never once forgotten about him
for the last 27 years.

53
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,310
I've always been the wife of Bae Young Han

54
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,600
and I will live as Bae Young Han's wife
in the future as well.

55
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,750
Farewell.

56
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,350
Dad.

57
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,540
Your mom...

58
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,340
Dad...

59
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,350
Don't worry about Mom, Dad.

60
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,850
Your mom...

61
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,660
Yes, I will take good care of Mom.

62
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,510
I'll take care of her, Dad.

63
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,310
Dad.

64
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,550
I love you, Dad.

65
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,620
Dong Sung, we started this to eat sweet
potatoes to our heart's content.

66
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,270
Father, just say one thing to me.

67
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:56,200
'My son Choi Won Jae, you worked hard,
well done, I'm proud of you!'

68
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,800
Just anything.

69
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:17,130
Dad!

70
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,350
Dad... I love you, Dad.

71
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,350
Dad!

72
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,090
The incense burning ritual will be set up
in the lobby of the headquarters.

73
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:43,630
And we also set up the incense altar in
72 Sung Jin plants and offices in the country.

74
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:51,580
Check the condolence visit schedule of senior
secretaries and ministers in the Blue House.

75
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,860
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,600
But Choi Won Jae's close friends, who were
pushed out to other regions and countries

77
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,330
after you became Vice Chairman,
are gathering now.

78
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,020
Some executives in the department
stores are also supporting Jung Yoon.

79
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,460
And President Choi Min Jae will
start to make his move.

80
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,900
At this rate, Managing Director Choi
Won Jae will lead the funeral

81
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,910
since he's the first son.

82
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,440
The press release, the procession of the funeral,
the decision on the burial site...

83
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,640
leading the meeting of the presidents
to help with the funeral...

84
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,670
For the next five days of the funeral period

85
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,130
Managing Director Choi Won Jae will be
at the center of all the Group's functions.

86
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,520
For Dad's final trip, I will stand in front.

87
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,450
- Don't worry.
- Yes, ma'am.

88
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,940
This is the plan for the Group's
assistance in the funeral.

89
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,060
Please take a look.

90
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,510
[Choi Dong Sung
Funeral]

91
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,120
<i>Seo Yoon!</i>

92
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,730
Don't become a good person.

93
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,440
Become the person others are afraid of.

94
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,110
I love you, my daughter.

95
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,010
Won Jae.

96
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,750
Jung Yoon, don't cry.

97
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,230
Eun Jung, you too. And Uncle, too.

98
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,950
All the important politicians and businessmen
will make a condolence visit.

99
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,720
What they want to see is not our tears.

100
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,140
It's the future of Sung Jin Group.

101
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:25,270
Let them remember Dad and
make them shed tears.

102
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,100
<i>Chairman Choi Dong Sung of Sung Jin Group
who led the company for 40 years</i>

103
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,700
<i>passed away last night from a chronic illness.</i>

104
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,900
<i>Chairman Choi Dong Sung was a live
witness to economic development and</i>

105
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,870
<i>the great tree of the Korean economy.</i>

106
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,010
<i>The sudden news of his death has
politicians and businessmen in shock</i>

107
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,610
<i>as they are making condolence
announcements one after the other.</i>

108
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,970
He's from the same hometown as my mom.

109
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,890
He even built an elementary school there.

110
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,360
My mom went to that school.

111
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,690
When I was little, my father drove a
remicon truck in the Middle East.

112
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,670
With the money he earned working for Sung
Jin Construction, he bought a house, too.

113
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,730
The picture that was taken when Chairman
Choi Dong Sung went to the construction site...

114
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,320
it's still at home.

115
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,700
Review the bid proposal for
Han Sung Steel again.

116
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,540
Raise the bidding price, too.

117
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,720
Someone has died. We can
talk about work later...

118
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,530
About 700 people die in Korea every day.

119
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,670
He's one of them.

120
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,890
What's different?

121
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,920
This is Jang Tae Joo.

122
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,090
<i>I saw the news.</i>

123
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:24,740
Tae Joo, even if we have one billion,
two billion, or more...

124
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,240
the atmosphere of commemorating
Chairman Choi Dong Sung has created...

125
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,640
Then Han Sung Steel will be
handed over to Sung Jin Group.

126
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,340
There is no plane leaving from JFK
because of heavy rain.

127
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,560
If I leave from Logan Airport in Boston,
I'll arrive there tomorrow morning.

128
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,830
Just give me one card.

129
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,930
I need a card that will shake up Choi Seo Yoon.

130
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,120
Do you have one?

131
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,030
I rented out the school yard nearby for parking

132
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,840
and I requested security around
the house from the police.

133
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,960
I had the meals be prepared in the
guest house, so they can eat there.

134
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,980
Eun Jung, the routine personnel change
of the department store is tomorrow, right?

135
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,610
Please proceed as usual.

136
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,550
Yes, I will.

137
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,090
Director Kim Hong Sik and others
who got pushed out...

138
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,070
want to see me after the funeral.

139
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,730
Meet them.

140
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,000
The ones who want to carry you to the
department store again will gather around.

141
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,520
Seo Yoon.

142
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,000
We're in the middle of the
mourning period for Dad

143
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,500
so it will be better to postpone
the personnel change...

144
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,940
Routine appointments, meetings,
business trips, investments...

145
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,130
I'm going to proceed with all
the company duties as usual.

146
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,090
Even if we stop for a few days
while we say good-bye to our dad...

147
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,640
we have to show that Sung Jin Group
keeps moving forward.

148
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,270
- Please do so.
- Understood.

149
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,870
I'm going to send one president to each
incense altar in the country.

150
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,180
Hey, President Kim.

151
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,780
Yes, bring President Bae and Kang,
and other minions together.

152
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,460
After you make a condolence visit,
let's have a chat in my room.

153
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,810
How long will you stay in Sung Jin Packaging

154
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,510
with only 600 employees and
keep sniffing glue?

155
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,760
You should return to the main force.

156
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,580
Okay.

157
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,170
I should return to the main force, too.

158
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,560
Tell the presidents you're friends with, Won Jae.

159
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,970
Regional assignments were
made by the General Affairs team

160
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,440
so tell them to head out in the morning.

161
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,140
Seo Yoon, the presidents should check in at
headquarters and come here for a visit...

162
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,400
All the regions should have a head mourner, too.

163
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:52,050
Presidents should talk about Dad and
memories about him with the visitors.

164
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,570
Let's have them console the visitors.

165
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,370
Let's do that, then.

166
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,480
It won't be an easy five-day period.

167
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,200
Uncle, Won Jae, Dong Hui and Sung Jae.

168
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Since we have four men

169
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,170
greet the visitors for two hours in teams
of two, then take a break for two hours.

170
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,520
You can't do that.

171
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,780
If the head mourner leaves the room,
he'll get a bad reputation.

172
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,680
I couldn't keep Father's company,
but I can keep the mourning altar.

173
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,480
The head mourner should stay in the room.

174
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,420
I got a call from the Office of Civil Affairs.

175
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,070
They would like to make it a state funeral.

176
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,470
One of the ex-prime ministers
will head the funeral.

177
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,100
Cabinet members and other leaders of
society will help with the funeral.

178
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,910
Oh, and they pointed me as the
representative of the family.

179
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:52,250
Since I'm heading the Group, they
probably thought it was appropriate.

180
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,350
I'll do my best, Won Jae.

181
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,290
- Sung Jae, you...
- Seo Yoon.

182
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,960
Let's make it a family funeral.

183
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,340
I'm sorry, I already said yes
to the Office of Civil Affairs.

184
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,380
It's Father's last trip!
And I'm his first born son!

185
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,400
Kim Tae Sung of Daemin Group drove it to
bankruptcy and crushed the family...

186
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,300
but he was still the head mourner
when his father passed away.

187
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,210
Seo Yoon, I did what you told me to
do for the last three years.

188
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,770
Let's just do what I want for once, okay?

189
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,750
- Won Jae.
- I'd like a family funeral, too.

190
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,900
I don't want other people to interfere
on my dad's last trip, Seo Yoon.

191
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,160
Seo Yoon, I think the family funeral will be better.

192
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,820
Won Jae can be the head mourner and
Myung Hoon should hold the portrait...

193
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,770
That's what I think, too.

194
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,280
Let's have a family funeral, Seo Yoon.

195
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,650
Mom.

196
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,290
Once Seo Yoon falls apart,
the Group will be in our hands.

197
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,590
Sung Jae, grab a hold of Won Jae's hand.

198
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,730
I will push off his back.

199
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,190
After he came back from the funeral of
Chairman Kim of Daemin Group...

200
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:17,830
your father made fun of the loud ceremony
when it was just an empty departure.

201
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,860
He doesn't like anything cumbersome.

202
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,490
Let's send him off quietly.

203
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,720
Mom.

204
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,560
The burial place is Hampyung Farm.

205
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,520
Let's put a small tombstone on the hill in the back

206
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,630
and serve him the seasonal herbs
and vegetables he liked.

207
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,030
Seo Yoon...

208
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,040
once Sung Jae gets married

209
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,350
I plan to go to Hampyung Farm.

210
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,660
Please let me send him off quietly,
just like his personality.

211
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,120
Seo Yoon, let's make it a family funeral.

212
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,860
Mom.

213
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,330
Let's have a state funeral for Father.

214
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,430
Father filled the coastlines and reclaimed land

215
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,000
then built Han Sung Steel, but...

216
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,310
['Unethical Businessman' who
privatized public company]

217
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,860
Without Father, there was no Han Sung Steel.

218
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,590
With the money Father earned from
the Middle East, he built the shipyard

219
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,480
and created thousands of jobs.

220
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,160
But right now, those people are
pointing their fingers at Father.

221
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,610
Sung Jae.

222
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,340
You and Seo Yoon were the only ones
who saw the last moments of Father.

223
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,470
Father passed away lonely.

224
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,130
Let's do the state funeral.

225
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,840
I want to send Father off in the grandest way.

226
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,360
That's how I want to send him off, Mom.

227
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,900
<i>Sung Jae.</i>

228
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,300
<i>Grab a hold of Won Jae's hand.</i>

229
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,470
You should say what you're thinking.

230
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,230
I should return to the main force, too.

231
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,250
Hold my hand for a few months,
then I'll divorce you.

232
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,450
I'll let you leave with the department
stores from this house.

233
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,220
I should it give some more thought.

234
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,860
I don't have anything to say today.

235
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,740
When we went to see the reclaimed land
to build a steel mill...

236
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,970
we heard the waves and Dong Sung said

237
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,250
that it sounded like molten
iron boiling, not ocean waves.

238
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:21,220
'Let's build plants, roads and even buildings
with the steel we make from here.'

239
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,380
I remember Dong Sung's face from back then.

240
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,020
Dong Jin.

241
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,610
How dare the ones who never held a shovel
even once badmouth my brother!

242
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,120
Seo Yoon, let's do the state funeral.

243
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:47,000
Let's make it a loud one so my brother
can't hear those who badmouthed him.

244
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,390
Uncle!

245
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,730
If my brother curses at me later
for making it too loud...

246
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,260
Jung Hee, I'll take the blame.

247
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,970
So Seo Yoon, proceed with it.

248
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,330
This is the first state funeral for a businessman.

249
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:13,150
It's an honor to Dad. And our family
and Sung Jin Group should be proud of it.

250
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,540
The state funeral will be
officially announced tomorrow.

251
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,650
And visitors will be coming. Let's get ready.

252
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,370
Knowing who you were,
knowing you were not his son...

253
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,080
he paved the road because he
didn't want you to get hurt

254
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,530
and cleaned up around the grave.

255
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:44,390
My son must have been hurting
when he heard those words.

256
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,780
Mom, let's give the shares of
Sung Jin Cement to Seo Yoon.

257
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,480
You and me... let's leave this house.

258
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,060
I felt that way once, too.

259
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,350
When you were little,
when you had a high fever...

260
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,440
I was holding you and he was driving.

261
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,030
On our way to the hospital, looking at you
when you couldn't even breathe well...

262
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:22,380
he was crying and saying 'please live'
while he was driving...

263
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,610
I was thankful.

264
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:34,120
Sure, the one and only time when
you and I were thankful...

265
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:40,020
let's pay it back by making this a state funeral.

266
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,590
Mom.

267
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,760
Hold Seo Yoon's hand tightly.

268
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:51,670
My Sung Jae, Seo Yoon will hurt a lot
when you shake off her hand.

269
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,080
Mom, I won't let go of Seo Yoon's hand.

270
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,500
Your father was a quiet gentleman.

271
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,720
Someone like that grew Chung Ma Construction
to the third biggest company in 10 years.

272
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,260
How will you fool that blood?

273
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,690
I'll wait.

274
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,940
It'll have to be longer than the
27 years you've already waited.

275
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,970
Sung Jae.

276
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,430
It's time to switch with Dong Hui.
I'm leaving.

277
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,580
It'll be a state funeral for
Chairman Choi Dong Sung.

278
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,120
There will be several special programs on TV.

279
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,250
Chairman Choi worked hard to build Han
Sung Steel but President Kim snatched it away.

280
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,720
What to do... we became the bad guys.

281
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,670
Johyung Industrial called and said they'll
drop from the consortium to take over Han Sung.

282
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,680
They only saw the face value.

283
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,830
If we lose on the face value... we're dead.

284
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,910
If we're losing on the surface,
then we should look at the hidden card.

285
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,110
Choi Won Jae... I need to meet with him.

286
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,810
Tae Joo, what a realtor is most scared of is
one with lots of fear.

287
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,500
He'll keep looking after he makes
a promise to sign the contract today.

288
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,690
He promises to give another payment,
then he wants his down payment back.

289
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,050
Getting the remaining payment
out of someone with fear is

290
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,630
harder than getting a penalty
out of a corporation.

291
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:31,040
Choi Won Jae, that man... won't bite.

292
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,580
Of course, because he's too scared.

293
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,300
The one with lots of fear doesn't trust himself.

294
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,450
I'll make him trust me and
President Choi Min Jae.

295
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,220
Call Johyung Industrial.

296
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,660
There will be no state funeral for
Chairman Choi Dong Sung.

297
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,200
Congressman Park, Congressman Jo...

298
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,830
thank you for coming in the
middle of the assembly audit.

299
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,940
- Where is Vice Chairman?
- She's in the library.

300
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,530
This is Choi Won Jae.

301
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,760
<i>This is Jang Tae Joo.</i>

302
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,850
<i>President Choi Min Jae asked me to call you.</i>

303
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,780
<i>Could I pay a visit now?</i>

304
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:30,960
Thank you for keeping a big burden until now.

305
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:38,770
I now plan to put the Sung Jin Cement
shares under my name.

306
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,810
Excuse me...

307
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,450
Was that really the Chairman's wish?

308
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,900
Seo Yoon and I were there for the last moments.

309
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,320
He asked Seo Yoon to leave...

310
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,110
then he asked me to take care of that load.

311
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,590
Could I confirm with Vice Chairman?

312
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,220
Of course you should.

313
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,330
Now that I see the four of you, I remember
when we went to the vacation house in Jinhae.

314
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:10,410
We spent several summers together
with all the family members.

315
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,010
Did Chairman leave any words for us?

316
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,680
He often used to tell me

317
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,510
that I could say what's really
on my mind to you.

318
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,790
And that I should consult with you
if I have a tough time.

319
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,650
I'd like to ask for your help in the future.

320
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,990
We'll follow the Chairman's last wish.

321
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,420
We'll proceed with transferring
the shares to your name.

322
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,730
<i>I'm going to live like you,
Chairman Choi Dong Sung.</i>

323
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,470
I saw this statistic before.

324
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,740
More than half of those
who died from drowning

325
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,320
died in water that they could have
stood straight up in if they tried.

326
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,220
The current is strong, the sea water
is coming into their mouth...

327
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,120
They're afraid that their feet won't touch
the ground if they tried.

328
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,230
They can't even straighten their knees,
so they just...

329
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,710
What killed them was not the sea.

330
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,920
It was the fear in their mind.

331
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,070
Why don't we try straightening our legs?

332
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,130
I straightened my legs once,
and I lost everything.

333
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,960
I lost everything in the
recapitalization three years ago.

334
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,720
That's good, you don't have any more to lose.

335
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,330
Let's try again.

336
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,080
If you win, you'll become the
owner of Sung Jin Group...

337
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,870
If you stay still, you live as the cute brother
who wags his tail for his little sister.

338
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,630
Seo Yoon has a grip on the Group.

339
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,970
All objects remain in their current
state without an external force.

340
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,170
The law of inertia.

341
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,930
I'll stir up Sung Jin Group from the outside.

342
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,630
The takeover of Han Sung Steel.

343
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,390
I understand you led the takeover
of Han Sung Steel until recently.

344
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:14,750
Hand me the bidding price and
issues of non-price elements.

345
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:17,470
Vice Chairman Choi Seo Yoon, who failed
at the takeover of Han Sung Steel

346
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,990
even when she put in the full
capabilities of Sung Jin Group...

347
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,250
she will be very shaken.

348
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,190
The state funeral will proceed.

349
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,640
When the mood changes, Seo Yoon
will take Han Sung Steel...

350
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,400
Make it a family funeral.

351
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,880
In the funeral, the head mourner's
wish is the family's wish.

352
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,880
When the funeral is over, you'll have to live
as the nice big brother for the rest of your life.

353
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,610
I need time to think.

354
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,520
Vice Chairman would like to
see you, Mr. Jang Tae Joo.

355
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,670
Sung Jin Shipping will start its plant
construction at the end of the year.

356
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,970
The estimated construction
price will be pretty high.

357
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,840
I'm planning to leave it to
Sung Jin Construction and Eden.

358
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,650
If I let go of the takeover of Han Sung Steel...

359
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,950
then you'll at least take care of my meals?

360
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:24,540
It'll be nice if Eden took charge of a research
building of Sung Jin Auto next year, too.

361
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,580
You must have a really bad memory.

362
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,590
I told you I wouldn't grab the rope.

363
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,510
I'm going to fight the tiger.

364
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,560
We're in mourning.

365
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,760
To behave this way in a house in mourning...

366
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:47,750
The first person who came to visit after the
mortuary for my late father was arranged

367
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,020
was a bank employee in charge of loans.

368
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,250
He was afraid that he wouldn't get paid
back the loan on the noodle shop.

369
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:02,460
He looked around for a long time, looking
for something to seize, then left.

370
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,300
Flies come to the family in mourning.

371
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,590
More flies come to a bigger family in mourning.

372
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,490
The mourning family of my father Jang Bong Ho.

373
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,120
The mourning family of your
father Choi Dong Sung.

374
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,510
Why should they be different?

375
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:36,320
Born to a poor family, you
work, then work, then work...

376
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,240
then you leave.

377
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,450
How is that different?

378
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,900
My dad grew 42 affiliates of Sung Jin Group.

379
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm envious.

380
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:02,800
He committed so many sins, but left
with all the prizes in the world.

381
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,510
Many people respect my dad.

382
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,920
Mr. Jang Tae Joo, this is a house in mourning.

383
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,930
When I was in high school, there was
a teacher with the nickname 'Jaws'.

384
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:30,950
He spent more time counting bribe
money than teaching classes.

385
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,570
One day, my friend Choon Ho called him by his
nickname 'Jaws' so he got really beat up.

386
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,980
And the teacher told my friend to respect him.

387
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,950
I thought about it...

388
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,810
just do one or the other.

389
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,330
Either be the teacher who is respected

390
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,310
or be the working man who loves a bribe.

391
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,310
And your father should just
be one or the other, too.

392
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,800
Either be a respected businessman

393
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,210
or be a greedy old hag who made lots
of money from stealing others' lands.

394
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:05,050
Sung Jin Group employees and their
families, the people of this country...

395
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,000
many are in mourning.

396
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,820
Usually when a rich lord dies,
his servants will cry the most.

397
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,970
Don't stir up Won Jae.

398
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,070
If Won Jae comes back to this game...

399
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:32,240
Why do you care if my bet comes from
my pocket or my loan?

400
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,420
Win the bet.

401
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,670
You and I are sitting at the same gambling table.

402
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,750
If you want to win, make a run for it.
I won't fold.

403
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,520
Choi Seo Yoon, I have what you have.

404
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,200
I have money and a dream.

405
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,770
You have a bit more of a stake than me.

406
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,640
I'm a little envious of that.

407
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:15,480
Director Park, raise the bid price of
Han Sung Steel to the maximum.

408
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,760
Schedule the creditors' visit for today.

409
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,460
The minister of commerce, the officials, and the
finance committee members in the assembly

410
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,320
should come tomorrow.

411
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,470
The senior secretary of commerce
was here today, right?

412
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:34,500
Call him and invite him to the
final departure ceremony.

413
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,710
Sung Jin Group... is great.

414
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,630
Let's make this clear though.

415
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:49,610
Choi Seo Yoon, you were born
in the master bedroom of this house

416
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,350
and walked through the living
room to get to this library.

417
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,650
But I, Jang Tae Joo, was born
in a shack in Shillim-dong...

418
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:07,230
and I'm sitting across from you in this library.

419
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,900
It won't be easy.

420
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,870
Be careful.

421
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:21,830
I think I'll really appreciate this advice.

422
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,400
<i>If you win, you'll become the
owner of Sung Jin Group...</i>

423
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,830
<i>If you stay still, you'll live as the cute brother
who wags his tail for his little sister.</i>

424
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,990
Uncle went home.

425
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:36,760
He's exhausted after greeting visitors
and crying all day at his age.

426
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,630
I asked him to go home and come
back tomorrow morning.

427
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,730
What could it be?

428
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,660
He argued with Dad for over 10 years
and sent off Yong Jae, too.

429
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,930
But Uncle looked like he lost half
his world after Dad passed away.

430
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,170
Hey hey, that's the love between
brothers and sisters.

431
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,600
I think of you whenever I go
see a ballet performance.

432
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,450
You really wanted to continue ballet.

433
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,980
How long has it been?

434
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,620
You were crying for days because you couldn't
continue any more with your flat feet...

435
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,380
You said you'd make your daughter a ballerina.

436
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,250
I ended up with three sons.

437
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,800
What if I don't even get a granddaughter?

438
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,940
Dad, help my kids to have daughters.

439
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,980
I miss Dad.

440
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,480
Jung Yoon.

441
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,140
I can't leave Father's last trip to someone else.

442
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,750
Let's have a family funeral.

443
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,970
Dong Hui, I'm hearing bad rumors in
the prosecutor's office.

444
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,380
How can you work there when
your heart has already left?

445
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,360
You should work in the company, too.

446
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,250
Jung Yoon.

447
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,500
Min Ho, Jae Ho, Sang Ho...

448
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,350
As a parent, you shouldn't let their
lives rust away in golf courses.

449
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,080
Honey, you too. Give some serious thought
to what I said to you earlier.

450
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,640
Hold my hand for a few months,
then I'll divorce you.

451
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,670
I'll let you leave with the department
stores from this house.

452
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,150
Let's have a family funeral for Father
and I'll become the head mourner...

453
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,000
Jung Yoon, Dong Hui.

454
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,350
I'll summon the presidents
and appoint my people...

455
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:44,980
I'll make another run for it.

456
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,150
It won't be easy. Seo Yoon is really...

457
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,160
Min Jae said he'll help me.

458
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,290
Jang Tae Joo, too.

459
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:00,960
Jang Tae Joo... he's the one who grew
Sung Jin Construction in 3 years from Eden...

460
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,740
He has money, a stake, and a
reason to help us.

461
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,870
He wants to own Han Sung Steel.

462
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,100
I'll give it to him.

463
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,470
Jung Yoon.

464
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,100
The golf courses are already yours.

465
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,340
Even if you tried and got crushed, Seo
Yoon can't take away your golf courses.

466
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,650
Let's hold a family meeting again.

467
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,490
Uncle is not here, and send
Sung Jae to the guest house.

468
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,770
Us four and Mother can push for a family funeral.

469
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,500
Then how would Seo Yoon go against it?

470
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,140
Won Jae, if you just let me have
the department stores...

471
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,170
We have a routine personnel change tomorrow.

472
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,040
I'll take good care of you.

473
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,070
Jung Yoon, let's do as I say.

474
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:03,220
Dong Hui, who should we side with?

475
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:11,160
If we have the state funeral for Father,
Seo Yoon will lead it.

476
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,880
And since the Group is
focused on the funeral now...

477
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,370
Seo Yoon will continue to lead the Group.

478
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,380
Seo Yoon will be on the news and TV, too.

479
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:27,420
Then people will really know that Seo Yoon
is the owner of Sung Jin Group.

480
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,740
Then we'll just end up
with three golf courses...

481
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,830
Whatever! So which side will benefit us?

482
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,350
If we have a family funeral for Father,
Won Jae will lead the funeral.

483
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,530
Won Jae will be everywhere on the news and TV.

484
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:52,010
If that happens, the Group might lean
a little towards Won Jae.

485
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:59,400
Dong Hui, I made up my mind when I quit ballet.

486
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,390
I'd let my children do whatever
they wanted to do.

487
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,720
I want to put the department stores
in the hands of our children.

488
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,010
What do we do, Dong Hui?

489
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,510
Let's do it like this.

490
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:21,000
Seo Yoon, I really tried to stop Won Jae.

491
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,150
Dong Hui tried to convince him, too...

492
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:28,280
But he said he was doing a family funeral.
He said he'd take hold of the Group again.

493
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,690
I'm sorry, Seo Yoon. You're busy
greeting the visitors and working...

494
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,760
I really tried to convince Won Jae, but...

495
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,520
Dong Hui did enough.

496
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,890
He didn't listen to Dad, so why
would he listen to Dong Hui?

497
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,800
Father was an elder of this society.

498
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,260
You were right about the state funeral.

499
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,390
What do we do, Seo Yoon?

500
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,210
Even Eun Jung is standing behind Won Jae.

501
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,830
If the department store stands with
Won Jae, it'll be tough for you, my Seo Yoon.

502
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:06,950
Postpone the routine personnel
change of the department store.

503
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:14,160
Thank you, Jung Yoon, Dong Hui.

504
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,380
Go back to the altar.

505
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,100
I'll go to the guesthouse and see if the
visitors' meals are being prepared properly.

506
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:25,740
It's the last meal that Dad is hosting,
so I should take care of it.

507
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,660
We'll get going, Seo Yoon.

508
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,420
My daughter Eun Jung wouldn't do such a thing.

509
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,960
It just happened an hour ago.

510
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:52,240
Jung Yoon and Dong Hui probably thought
about which side would benefit them.

511
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,140
Eun Jung is still thinking.

512
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,580
I'm very disappointed.

513
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:06,870
Dad gladly wanted to give Eun Jung
the department stores.

514
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:10,940
But Eun Jung...

515
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,400
Call Uncle and ask him to come right now.

516
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,080
There will be no family meeting.

517
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:23,330
Seo Yoon, I'll try to convince Won Jae.

518
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:28,100
I didn't know about the
state funeral or family funeral.

519
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:34,580
He didn't want anything bothersome,
so I wanted it to be a quiet send off...

520
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,050
I know, Mom.

521
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,670
You don't need to see Won Jae.

522
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,890
Who is the Managing Director of
the Corporation in Europe?

523
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,910
Director Lee Sang Min.

524
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:48,180
Tell him to come back to Korea by tomorrow.

525
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:53,250
As soon as Dad's funeral is over,
Won Jae will leave for Europe.

526
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,010
Check Won Jae's schedule for
the past three months.

527
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:01,630
The presidents and executives that
Won Jae met with... identify all of them.

528
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,670
They will be assigned to other
regions within a few days.

529
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,220
And Eun Jung will go to Europe, too.

530
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,170
I'm sorry, Director Park.

531
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,310
It'll be better for Myung Hoon to finish college
in Rome before he comes back to Korea.

532
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,550
Mother, Myung Hoon is in junior high right now.

533
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,530
He started in the international
school when he was eight

534
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,810
and he only went to school abroad.

535
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:46,780
If he comes back in the middle of it,
he'll have a hard time adapting to school here.

536
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,800
I can't go, Mother.

537
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,700
I'm asking you, Won Jae.

538
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,710
I don't want to show a messy sight
on your father's last trip.

539
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:07,970
When the Group matter gets settled,
Seo Yoon will bring you back, too.

540
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:12,370
Let's be a happy family again like before
when that day comes.

541
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,260
You'll be leaving right after
the post-funeral ritual...

542
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,890
you should start packing
and wrap up work, too.

543
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:32,790
Mother, with my work on the department
stores, I should be here...

544
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,300
The routine personnel change will be delayed.

545
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,790
I think she was disappointed.

546
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:48,410
Jung Yoon came to Seo Yoon to ease
Won Jae's feelings...

547
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:52,730
but you didn't say anything, so
Seo Yoon felt really hurt.

548
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:57,420
Don't worry. Seo Yoon is very thoughtful.

549
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,980
She'll forgive you in a few years.

550
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,930
<i>Dad!</i>

551
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:54,100
When Won Jae was having foolish thoughts,
you should have at least let me know.

552
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,330
He said he'd give me a divorce.

553
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,880
You know well... there were more days
he slept outside than in the bedroom.

554
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,160
You met with a few of the women
and ended things for me, too.

555
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:15,440
I wanted to leave, but because of you...
and because of Father-in-law's wish...

556
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:21,060
he said he'd let me go with the department
stores, so I was conflicted for a bit.

557
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:27,200
Dad, ask Seo Yoon so that
only Won Jae can leave...

558
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,880
How many political purges happened
during the Joseon Dynasty?

559
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,950
Many innocent people were executed and exiled.

560
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:42,060
Eun Jung, even if you have a lot to say,
just leave quietly for now.

561
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,400
Dad!

562
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,290
If I hold your hand, Won Jae will come too.

563
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:49,120
I served the Chairman for 35 years.

564
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,230
His last wish for me was to help Vice Chairman
become Chairman and make it solid as a rock...

565
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,870
I'd like to follow that wish.

566
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:01,200
I am your daughter.

567
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,880
Eun Jung, when you come back from Rome...

568
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:11,040
I'll live the rest of my life as your father then.

569
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:14,590
I'm sorry.

570
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,610
I thought about it for the first time.

571
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:41,130
I feel bad for my husband.

572
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,850
One sister betrayed him with the words from his
heart to get the department stores...

573
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:53,400
And another sister pushed his back
and kicked him out of the country.

574
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,080
Is Sung Jin Department Store opening in
Seocho-dong early next year?

575
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,670
You attended the groundbreaking ceremony...

576
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:07,140
my goodness. Looks like I'll be attending
the building dedication.

577
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,890
I don't need alimony.

578
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:33,470
Just let me leave with the department stores.

579
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,830
And guarantee the visiting
rights of Myung Hoon.

580
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,050
This is your last glass.

581
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:57,520
I'll hold your hand, Won Jae.

582
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,260
My Mom used to call me when the sun went
down asking me when I was coming home...

583
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,300
But then I made money and bought
her a house and a car...

584
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,030
now she doesn't even call when
I haven't been home for three days.

585
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:13,900
'It's okay if my daughter doesn't come home. As
long as the money comes to my account.' Is that it?

586
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,280
The takeover of Han Sung
Steel might not happen.

587
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,740
To chat about family at a time like this...

588
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,240
Smile!

589
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,440
You still don't know that Tae Joo and I talk about
family and the old days when we get nervous?

590
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:40,060
When I was 17, I went to the juvenile
detention center for the first time.

591
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,610
I walked through the gate of the detention
center, listening to Christmas carols...

592
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,170
This is Jang Tae Joo.

593
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,170
<i>This is Choi Won Jae.</i>

594
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:57,110
Sure, let's straighten our legs.

595
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:06,580
We'll make the preparations. Alright.

596
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:12,260
We'll start the plan at 9 o'clock tomorrow
morning. Let the media know at 8:45.

597
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:15,520
Director Yoon, make arrangements for a
place and prepare a press release.

598
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,330
No one in Sung Jin Group can know about this.

599
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,150
What time does President Choi Min Jae arrive?

600
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:25,310
7:45 in the morning, Kimpo Airport.

601
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,940
Han Sung Steel will be ours soon.

602
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,830
The bishop came for a visit.

603
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:42,070
He even missed the mass for the dead
at 6 o'clock this morning.

604
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,220
Wake Won Jae up.

605
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,270
He must be tired. He drank a lot.

606
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:52,030
I'll wake him up before the visitors come.

607
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,370
About Dad's state funeral...

608
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:59,970
the government will make an official
announcement at 10 o'clock this morning.

609
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:04,080
The funeral committee meeting will
be held at 2 o'clock this afternoon.

610
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,550
I'll be there.

611
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:10,060
Business groups will come and help
with the meals for the visitors.

612
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:14,560
Jung Yoon, dismiss the Group employees
working in the guest house now.

613
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,530
Vice Chairman.

614
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,870
Managing Director Choi Won Jae is holding
a press conference right now.

615
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,510
I am Choi Won Jae, the Managing Director of
the strategic planning division in Sung Jin Group.

616
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:08,450
I'll announce the decision from my family regarding
the funeral procedure for my late father.

617
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,440
After a family meeting last night

618
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,180
we decided to hold a family funeral for
the late Chairman Choi Dong Sung.

619
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,460
- Eun Jung.
- I'm shocked too.

620
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,830
I was also disappointed to hear that
I should leave with Won Jae to Europe.

621
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:24,500
Between you and me...

622
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,130
I thought you'd at least confirm with me
before you made a decision.

623
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,170
What to do?

624
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:37,040
Looks like I'll end up at the dedication
for the department store in Seocho-dong.

625
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:41,510
Jung Yoon, do you want more soup?

626
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:48,040
For commemorating the accomplishments
of my late father Chairman Choi Dong Sung

627
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,800
and acknowledging his contribution to society...

628
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,290
To those in the government ministries and others
who proposed a state funeral for my late father

629
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:56,410
I'd like to express my gratitude at this time.

630
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:59,640
I'll be helping the head mourner Choi Won Jae

631
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,270
and lead the funeral procedure. I am Choi
Min Jae, President of Sung Jin Construction.

632
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:10,370
We've decided that the burial place will be
on the family site in Hampyung Farm.

633
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:14,610
The presidents assigned to other regions
will return to Seoul immediately

634
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:19,870
and attend the funeral committee meeting
at 2 o'clock this afternoon.

635
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:24,720
Managing Director Choi Won Jae,
the head mourner, will lead the meeting.

636
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,680
All the official details regarding
the funeral matters

637
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,990
will be handled by Managing Director
Choi Won Jae and me from this moment on.

638
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:37,570
We will end the family announcement now.

639
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,070
I'm sorry, Minister.

640
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:44,710
We had a family meeting early this morning,
and that's what Mother wanted.

641
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:48,450
It's been chaotic, so I haven't
been able to call you.

642
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:54,330
I'll invite everyone who helped with
proposing the state funeral soon.

643
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,960
We can't just accept the family funeral like this.

644
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,080
Then what can we do?

645
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,540
Won Jae for the family funeral,
me for the state funeral.

646
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:20,680
We can't reveal our conflict to the world.

647
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,550
This is the last trip for Dad.

648
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:29,540
Managing Director Choi Won Jae crossed
the bridge that he can't go return on.

649
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:33,620
Then I should make sure he doesn't return.

650
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:37,930
Won Jae and Min Jae both.

651
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,390
Seo Yoon!

652
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,380
<i>The father I saw was...</i>

653
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,920
<i>a horseman who drove Chairman
Choi Dong Sung's carriage.</i>

654
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,080
<i>This is the altar that will determine
the owner of Sung Jin Group.</i>

655
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:34,570
<i>This time, I'll be the priest.</i>

656
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:36,590
[3 Days Later]

657
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:40,040
I thought all the rumors in the world
came out of women in hair salons.

658
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,410
But it came out of men in saunas.

659
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:46,360
The rumor that Choi Won Jae is pulling
the presidents has become widespread.

660
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:53,870
Some brothers I know called me and
asked for a steel distribution store...

661
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,500
President Jang.

662
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:02,250
The one who set the table for us is leaving today.

663
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:06,300
<i>The family funeral of The late Chairman
Choi Dong Sung will happen today.</i>

664
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,070
<i>The coffin will leave the house soon</i>

665
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,680
<i>and a ceremony will be held in
front of Sung Jin headquarters</i>

666
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,310
<i>then it will be leaving to a
burial ground in Hampyung.</i>

667
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,190
<i>At 9 o'clock when the ceremony commences</i>

668
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:19,550
<i>all the employees of the 42
affiliates of Sung Jin Group</i>

669
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:26,000
<i>will have a moment of silence to commemorate
the great tree of the Korean economy.</i>

670
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,330
Seo Yoon.

671
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,250
Father...

<i>We have to win the bid of Han Sung Steel.</i>

674
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:50,430
There are more than a couple of
problems with Seo Yoon's plan.

675
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:54,110
<i>The game became simple.
Who will put in more money?</i>

676
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,790
- Put in everything, 1.5 trillion.
- Let's go all-in.

677
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,300
<i>I'll give you one piece of advice.
Watch out for Min Jae.</i>

678
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,690
Could we start again?

<i>Seo Yoon will go to prison soon.</i>

<i>Han Sung Steel will be in our hands soon.</i>

<i>There is nothing you can own.</i>

<i>Han Sung Steel will be taken over by...</i>

<i>I'll make sure no one remembers...</i>

685
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:17,770
<i>that Chairman Choi Dong Sung
existed in Sung Jin Group.</i>
