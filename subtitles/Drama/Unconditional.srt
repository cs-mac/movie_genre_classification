While I was in The Commons,

I saw a guy that matched the
description of Billy's killer.

382

402
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,190
But it's rough.

403
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,697
Once upon a time,

404
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:57,000
there lived a little oriole
named Firebird,

405
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:01,038
and Firebird just lived
for the sunshine.

406
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,708
He would bask
in that glow for hours.

407
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,276
But when the rains would come,

408
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,612
he would complain to his mama.

409
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:11,415
He wanted to know why
God gave the storms power

410
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,650
to take away the sun.

411
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:17,321
And his mama would
just smile at him and say,

412
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:18,655
"You'll know someday

413
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:21,792
when you take a walk
on the clouds."

414
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:26,663
Now, over and over again,
the rains would come,

415
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:30,567
and over and over again, little
Firebird would complain to his mama.

416
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:34,738
Until one day,
a huge storm rolled in,

417
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,108
and his mama had
a different answer.

418
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,745
She said, "It's up there
waiting for you.

419
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,681
You just have to see it
for yourself."

420
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:47,484
Now, little Firebird
was scared.

421
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:50,087
He hadn't used his wings
much at all.

422
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,190
Yet he went up
into the great unknown.

423
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:55,225
But instead of answers,

424
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:58,929
he was met with lightning
and thunder and a howling wind.

425
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:02,499
He feared
it would rip him apart.

426
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,236
He was about to turn back
when it happened.

427
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:09,072
He broke through the clouds,

428
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:12,442
and there it was,

429
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:15,445
more beautiful than ever.

430
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:18,782
And in that moment,
it all became clear.

431
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,421
No storm could
take the sun away.

432
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,957
The sun was always shining.

433
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,828
It was as constant
as his mother's love.
