Dear Wendy, I'm writing to tell you
the story about the two of us-

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,874
- as I saw it, but never had the
nerve to tell you face to face.

3
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,558
Maybe things would have gone
differently if I had told you then.

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,428
And maybe things would not
have to end this way.

5
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,756
I've lived in Electric Park Square
all my life.

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,397
And all my life the wheel from
the elevator tower was creaking.

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,632
We called it the Ferris wheel.

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,829
But now, as I write this
I can't see the square, -

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,749
- and I can't hear the creaking.

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,830
And worst of all
I do not have you next to me.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,639
OK, Susan...

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,759
Here are your round-nosed
full metal jackets.

13
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,153
Freddie, these are yours.
I got hollow-point expanders. 32s.

14
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,837
I was stubborn as a child.

15
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,831
My dad thought it was a forgone
conclusion I'd work in the mine.

16
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,276
I think a week went by
with the same ritual.

17
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,909
Down in the morning
with him hot-tempered as usual.

18
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,878
Then up again, because
I refused to get off the elevator.

19
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,996
And up to Clarabelle, who'd be
waiting every day to take me home.

20
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:20,877
Clarabelle was our maid. She battled
Dad's decisions tooth and nail.

21
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,269
She'd say her little boy was
far too sensitive for the mine.

22
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,955
Too weak
with those skinny arms of his.

23
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,672
He had an imagination. And one day
his ideas would save the world.

24
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,832
She had no doubt about that.

25
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,229
Dicky!

26
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,837
...with that rifle he pulls the
trigger on a pair of underwear.

27
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,188
- No!
- Thought he had about a 10 point...

28
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,756
- Hey there...
- Dick.

29
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,511
Richard.
Hey, honey, how you doin'?

30
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,512
Two chocolate donuts, please.

31
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,639
We bought an Aunt Maple's
chocolate muffin every morning.

32
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,713
"That's the one
you like the best, Dicky."

33
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,395
Aunt Maple's
special chocolate muffin.

34
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,631
- I'm passionate about 'em.
- So did Sheriff Krugsby.

35
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,759
Thank you for my bag, Mr Salomon.
Good day, Sheriff.

36
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,752
Good day, Clarabelle. Richard...

37
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,194
All right, Howard. A bag
for my early-morning lollipop.

38
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,518
Dad gave in after a week.
I escaped the clutches of the mine.

39
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,798
But before you ask why
I keep talking about Clarabelle...

40
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,429
Well
she's the reason we met, Wendy.

41
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,394
Clarabelle got me a job at Salomon's.
That it was better for my fantasy, -

42
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,598
- or helped to inspire me to save
the world was difficult to see.

43
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,355
I stocked shelves with a
strange fellow named Stevie.

44
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,718
He never said a word, and
he didn't work in the mine either.

45
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,712
He claimed he was too tall.

46
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,272
Mr Salomon owned the supermarket.
He always looked very worried.

47
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,876
He was afraid of armed robbery
and spoke often of the gangs, -

48
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,157
- but I'd never seen them.

49
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,754
I'm hyperventilating.

50
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,877
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

51
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,199
Sorry.
Don't worry, I'll ring these up.

52
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,793
Go to your room, put on your white
shirt. Mind you don't wrinkle it.

53
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,715
And your tie. You're going to
Sebastian's birthday party.

54
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,433
I don't want to.

55
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,592
Sebastian was
exceptionally irritating.

56
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,877
Why Clarabelle made me go
was a mystery.

57
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,789
He did a particularly annoying
thing with his eyebrows.

58
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,316
- Go and get him a nice present.
- Why?

59
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,793
- Because you'll make new friends.
- I have friends.

60
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,595
Who is your friends?

61
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,438
- Come here, Dicky.
- I'm not going.

62
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,275
Come on now...

63
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,198
Come on, put your arms around me.

64
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,673
There was no fighting Clarabelle.
I had to get the idiot a present.

65
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,274
Hey, D! Over here!

66
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,753
Huey got his leg braces that day.
He lived behind the square.

67
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,316
He had virtually no legs.
You got them?

68
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,119
Yeah, I did.

69
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,513
Now Freddie won't get beaten up for
having a brother in a wheelchair.

70
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,388
- They cost 7000 bucks.
- Freddie! 700.

71
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,790
Freddie always exaggerated tenfold.

72
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,876
By the way, he got beat up more
once his brother used the braces.

73
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,869
Anyway, I had to buy a present
for that brat Sebastian.

74
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,112
- Catch you later.
- See you, Dick.

75
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,478
- Why tell everyone I got beat up?
- They already know.

76
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,870
No one knows.

77
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,599
It looks like you got
a crutch up your ass.

78
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,148
- What do you want?
- To buy something.

79
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,198
What?

80
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,077
A present.

81
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,712
- Who is it for?
- An idiot.

82
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,515
- A guy or a girl?
- A guy.

83
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,549
Her name was Susan. She smelled
just like her mom's lousy store.

84
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,634
We'd gone to the same school.

85
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,759
Susan had never gotten breasts
like the other girls at school.

86
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,631
- What about the toy gun?
- It's been there for a century.

87
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,314
So what?

88
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,870
I think it's kind of pretty.

89
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,711
- Can I see it?
- Yeah... I suppose.

90
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,754
Such a shitty present would serve
Sebastian right. It wasn't even new.

91
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,828
It had a burn mark
on the side of the stock.

92
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,079
He would hate this present.
I couldn't wait to give it to him.

93
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,838
That's a nice present for Sebastian.
He always pretends he's shooting.

94
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,238
- He's gonna love it.
- You think so?

95
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,794
I began to wonder about the present.
There were too many weapons.

96
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,873
Besides, I was a pacifist.
How could I forget that?

97
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,829
It would be wrong to give a boy a
gun. What would he grow up into?

98
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,554
Keep your tie on!

99
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,112
So I decided to give Sebastian a
book: "The Picture of Dorian Gray".

100
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,478
Abridged, since someone had torn
out the last 20 pages. No matter.

101
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,393
I'd gotten it cheap.

102
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,828
But Sebastian didn't open it
so I didn't see his disappointment.

103
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,717
He didn't like the toy gun.
Can I have my money back?

104
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,197
We don't do returns.

105
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,678
Oh... OK.

106
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,555
- Bye.
- Bye.

107
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,397
I wanted to throw the toy gun away
immediately, but I didn't.

108
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,155
It felt smooth and nice
in my pocket.

109
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,716
Some years later my dad died after
a temper tantrum in the mine.

110
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,190
I didn't mind too much
since I never really knew him.

111
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,750
Richard, I'm really sorry.

112
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,156
You're going to be all right.
We'll all keep an eye out on you.

113
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,199
With Mom having died years ago
I was alone for real.

114
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,796
I was a real loser, like everyone
else who didn't work in the mine.

115
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,392
I stayed in Electric Park
with what my father left me.

116
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,632
Mostly loose doorframes
after his door-slamming.

117
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,636
And Clarabelle quit.
She was really quite old now.

118
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,191
While I was tidying up
I came across the toy gun again.

119
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,951
And that was it, Wendy.
That was where it all started.

120
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,678
I thought you said
you were a pacifist?

121
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,038
Perhaps I did
but it's just an old toy gun.

122
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,190
It's not a toy.

123
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,159
It's a 6.65 mm
double action revolver.

124
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,711
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

125
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,869
Who is it?

126
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,318
Hi, Stevie. Nice to see you.

127
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,911
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

128
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,792
- Can I sit?
- Yeah.

129
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,549
So...
Is everything all right?

130
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,677
Yeah. Uhm...

131
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,753
- I need to show you something.
- OK.

132
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,872
This is a 7.63 mm
model 1896 broom-handle -

133
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,669
- from the battle of El Alamein.

134
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,514
It belonged to one of
Rommel's tank commanders, -

135
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,511
- but it didn't serve him well.

136
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,835
When the allies attacked, he tried
to rally petrified Italian deserters.

137
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,516
He wanted to set an example
and execute the Italian sergeant.

138
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,469
But it misfired. Didn't shoot.

139
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,872
So they locked him in a destroyed
tank and left him in the sun.

140
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,359
My grandfather found the
baked body two weeks later, -

141
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,876
- the treacherous gun
still in his hands.

142
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,631
Really?

143
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,838
- That's really something, huh?
- I got something for you, too.

144
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,509
What is it?

145
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,595
It's for your gun. I made it myself.
I found an old casing.

146
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,912
I thought maybe you'd want to try
shooting your gun. Just for fun.

147
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,315
OK.

148
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,473
- Come on then.
- Now?

149
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,869
All right.

150
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,753
Hey, I'm a pacifist too.
I'd never dream of shooting anyone.

151
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,071
Of course not.

152
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,149
- This way. To the old mine.
- OK.

153
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,198
I followed Stevie through
the closed-down part of the mine.

154
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,875
It was dangerous there.

155
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,789
But we went down to
some old, forgotten shaft.

156
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,470
You have to be really quiet.

157
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,839
- Down there?
- Straight down.

158
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,430
- Is it all right?
- Totally safe.

159
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,274
- Haven't you been here before?
- No.

160
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,831
I'm not crazy about the mines.

161
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,117
You don't go out much, do you?

162
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,796
Never do that! Always
keep your firearm pointed down.

163
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,595
- Pointed down?
- At all times.

164
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,797
What I'm gonna do now, -

165
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,155
- I'll pull this lever and open up
the chamber. There it is.

166
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,916
I'm going to take the cartridge
and place it right there...

167
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,351
Wow! OK...

168
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,710
A bull's eye.
On your very first shot.

169
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,515
I couldn't even do that
with Bad Steel.

170
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,836
What did you say?

171
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,875
Bad Steel.
That's what I call it.

172
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,193
General Patton named his revolver.
I thought it was kind of cool.

173
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,191
God, yours is so tiny!
It's like a little lady's gun.

174
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,193
- You're right.
- You should give it a girl's name.

175
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,559
Wendy.

176
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,997
I'll call it Wendy.

177
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,597
It's perfect.

178
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,193
Suddenly, I was one of
those people with guns.

179
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,400
With a scary, bad conscience
I touched the gun that night.

180
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,318
Guns made the world an evil place.
But I couldn't get rid of it.

181
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,518
Not even back when I thought
it wasn't dangerous.

182
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,751
And now you were mine.

183
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,150
Because it is you I'm referring to.

184
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,189
It was as though you, a gun
were trying to tell me something.

185
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,273
Something I did not yet understand.

186
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,595
One thing was sure, Wendy.
I had found a new friend.

187
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,389
And it was you.

188
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,755
Dear Wendy
it's your sensitive friend again, -

189
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,594
- who, in his ecstasy of meeting
you, has dug out his old music.

190
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,989
The Zombies.

191
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,513
Well, no one told me about her

192
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,831
the way she lied

193
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:45,268
no one told me about her
how many people cried

194
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,716
but it's too late
to say you're sorry

195
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,754
how would I know
why should I care?

196
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,511
Please don't bother trying
to find her, she's not there

197
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:05,315
let me tell you about the way she
looks, the way she acts

198
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,551
her voice is soft and cool
her eyes are clear and bright

199
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,393
but she's not there

200
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,755
- Stevie! They could set dogs on us.
- No, relax.

201
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,798
We should keep a safe distance
to avoid stuff like that.

202
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,038
It's not a problem.
Let's just shoot.

203
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,628
Stevie and I had found each other
in this dark, secret passion.

204
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,759
He was a technical genius.
And we kept reading.

205
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,150
Stevie about the metal
me about the shooting.

206
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,712
Like why an exit wound
says everything about a shot, -

207
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,396
- and about a weapon
and its potential. Or its "soul".

208
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,869
Stevie and I actually started
talking a little bit.

209
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,233
Good velocity.
Causes immediate incapacitation.

210
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,632
And luckily I had you now, Wendy.
Every second of the day.

211
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,635
We started carrying. You and
Bad Steel lay in our pockets.

212
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,632
It felt important and reassuring.

213
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,953
The two of you made us grow.
Even Mr Salomon was impressed.

214
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,875
I can't take it anymore...

215
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,713
It's all...

216
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,751
They say gangs are completely
out of hand in town.

217
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,400
And...

218
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,151
Maybe I'm overreacting.
I don't know.

219
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,391
What do you think, Dick?

220
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,879
I must say Clarabelle guessed right.
You've really come around.

221
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:06,672
You walk with confidence, you look
folks in the eye at the checkout.

222
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,271
I like that. It breeds respect.
More maybe than a gun would.

223
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,837
He made me assistant manager
and would have given me a raise.

224
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,870
Stevie was a better man, too.
He took a loan and bought a van.

225
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,238
He had his own company and could
look people in the eye too.

226
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,154
Stevie. Congratulations.

227
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,118
- You finally got it.
- Thanks, Dick.

228
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,235
We'd stopped sneaking along when
the real men came up from the mine.

229
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,392
We were just as good as them.

230
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,476
Electric Park Square was just as
much ours. All the zones we named:

231
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,872
The Slope Corner, The Shack
Way Out, East Side, -

232
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,675
- Center Pole, Shopside
The Swamp, -

233
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,231
- where the water always rose
from the drains. Slong Island.

234
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,236
And Salomon's. It was all just
as much ours now. If not more.

235
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,435
I need this slice from you.

236
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,473
In a way it's a shame
we're keeping this to ourselves.

237
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,790
What do you mean?

238
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,789
Pacifists with guns is
such a great idea, -

239
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,755
- it's practically our duty
to share it with others.

240
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,989
- Like who?
- Like the people who need it.

241
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,277
OK...

242
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,832
We were losers.
Maybe not right now, but we were.

243
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,439
That's right. We were not the
only losers in Electric Park.

244
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,559
Exactly.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

245
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,757
- You need some help?
- No, I'm OK.

246
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,591
- When is it?
- Five o'clock, old mine building.

247
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,990
- You're gonna be there, right?
- Yeah.

248
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,397
I'd have to ask permission
to get out of the store.

249
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,871
Hey! It's over here! Right here!

250
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,630
Stevie
let's find something they can sit on.

251
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,232
It wasn't easy to get them out of
their shells, but there they were.

252
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,838
By the old mine we had a meeting.
The losers from Electric Park.

253
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,118
Susan!
Glad you could join us here.

254
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,395
Hi, Freddie!

255
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,191
Look at it as an experiment to help
you become what you really are.

256
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,156
What's that?

257
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,996
A whole lot happier, I expect.

258
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,438
You guys in, or...?

259
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,832
I think it's a good idea.
I mean, there's pacifichism...

260
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,119
- It's good we don't shoot anybody.
- You mean pacifism.

261
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,237
The Dandies was
the name I came up with.

262
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,993
It had the cheerfulness
I was hoping for.

263
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,472
Hey, guys!
Freddie found a hole.

264
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,109
- Found a what?
- A trapdoor.

265
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,715
I think it goes down to the mine.
Come on!

266
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,878
- Looks good.
- Great.

267
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,670
- They're coming!
- Are they coming?

268
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,595
It's deep! Damn, it's deep! I think
it leads through all the mines.

269
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,873
Come on, hurry!

270
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,636
- Oh, my God, it's huge!
- What are we talking about here?

271
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,713
The disused mine building became
what we later called The Temple.

272
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,749
Freddie knew lots of other
abandoned mine shafts.

273
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,834
One of them emerged in what
would become our living room.

274
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,833
- Don't make too much noise.
- This is exactly 15 feet.

275
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,595
- Where are you?
- I could get you down with the rope.

276
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,710
- Where is he?
- I'm over here.

277
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,632
- Careful.
- Is the flash on?

278
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,714
Everyone brought
something to The Temple.

279
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,318
Before long Huey and Susan brought
guns they'd dug out from somewhere.

280
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,868
I hope it still works.

281
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,674
Stevie?

282
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,753
We have a new addition over here.

283
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,799
Can you come help look at it?

284
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,200
Wow! You got yourself
a hand cannon there, Huey.

285
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,748
Let me take a look.

286
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,435
I believe this is a 52 caliber.

287
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:39,517
Which means the bullets are that big.
It's what we call a front loader.

288
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,720
Huey had picked an older model.
Nobody could say it wasn't dandy, -

289
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,870
- as we soon began to say.

290
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,549
Extremely dandy.

291
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,474
Good sport. What's its name?
Is it a he, or a she?

292
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,634
- Oh, it's a he.
- Thought so.

293
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,716
I think his name should be Lyndon.

294
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,788
And everything revolved around
you and I, Wendy.

295
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,356
And we kept listening to
The Zombies.

296
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,830
This one's Lee?
Can I hold them?

297
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,519
Yes.

298
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:23,039
Susan stuck to American history. We
didn't like modern, vulgar weapons.

299
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,878
They were not dandy. She even had
a nice little revolver for Freddie -

300
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,913
- which was later christened Emily.

301
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,839
- Are you sure, Freddie?
- I'm sure.

302
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,752
But he declined. He had a crush on
a gun he'd spotted in a gun store.

303
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,549
$800, said Freddie
which of course meant 80.

304
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,158
None of us had that kind of money.
It was hard on Emily.

305
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,118
But then again, she was no beauty.

306
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,708
We had poetry readings.
And the Dandies made a secret sign.

307
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,553
- You guys want to hear it?
- Yeah.

308
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,270
Lee is cold as ice
Grant is hot as hell.

309
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,830
I think they're both real nice, -

310
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:23,072
- and I hope it all ends well.

311
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,836
Can you teach me to write like that?

312
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,629
Then we had our inauguration.

313
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,475
Drinking Offley's Invalid Port
the most dandy I could get.

314
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,269
It was terrible, but soon became
part of the rituals.

315
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,275
Stevie suggested appointing me
chief, but I insisted on a vote.

316
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,115
A vote where everyone had a say.
Stevie, Huey, Freddie and Susan.

317
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,351
But even more important
you, Wendy.

318
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,436
Stevie's Bad Steel, Susan's Lee
and Grant, and Huey's Lyndon.

319
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,354
- Hi, Lyndon.
- Hello, Wendy.

320
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,833
Since you brought it up
what about you?

321
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,150
You.

322
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,392
- And Bad Steel?
- You too.

323
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,756
- No doubt about it. You, Dick.
- You.

324
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,713
And Lyndon?

325
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,716
I don't get it.
I can't really say anything.

326
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,112
Just pick him, Huey.
You just ruined the whole thing.

327
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,399
OK, OK... Uhm.
You, too.

328
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,710
- Are you sure?
- Real sure.

329
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,634
- That makes 80 votes.
- Bravo.

330
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,158
OK... the regulations. The most
important thing for a Dandy is-

331
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,439
- never to show off his partner.
Whatever the provocation.

332
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,150
We carry them as moral supports.

333
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,152
That's the most important thing.

334
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,792
They may be carried
but never brandished.

335
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,595
Not one of us were in doubt
about the most important thing.

336
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,152
The reason why our partners could
never be exposed to full light-

337
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,710
- and thereby woken up.
Once awoken, -

338
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,839
- nothing could stop them
from killing.

339
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,869
It was so forbidden to say that word
that we called it "loving".

340
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,512
And loving could never ever happen.
That would be the end of it all.

341
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,751
- Hear.
- Hear.

342
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,715
I'm Patrick Besant-Matthews
a forensic pathologist-

343
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,792
- with a special interest
in firearms injuries.

344
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,915
We're going to discuss how
firearms injuries appear in the body.

345
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,271
The entrance site intersected this
junction between two skull bones...

346
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,750
Maybe he shot from close range.

347
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,515
It has to be close range.

348
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,718
...the base of the
22 rim fire cartridge...

349
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,710
Do you see that? See how fast
it slides straight through?

350
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,437
This one coming out
is my favorite.

351
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,115
...someone shoots him
with a military rifle...

352
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,835
It really didn't feel like much.
Much less than a punch.

353
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:43,195
They'd cut themselves, then tied
leather straps around their balls.

354
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,118
The pain made them stronger.
They would hide in the forest, -

355
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,876
- and then go up to the American
soldiers and cut their heads off.

356
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,714
These warriors would become
practically unstoppable.

357
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,709
That's their testicles
and that's the penis.

358
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,396
Susan, cover your eyes. I don't
know if you've seen a penis before.

359
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,755
I'm sorry I had to show you that.

360
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,876
He being an old Vietnam vet
obviously has the. 45 service pistol.

361
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,436
Everyone loved "guess the gun".

362
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,833
She killed her perpetrator
with a. 44 revolver.

363
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,674
He's gonna go with
the service revolver.

364
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,352
It's a treacherous gun.

365
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,274
Because he's a military man
he'll have the all automatic.

366
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,715
Only this will fit in
her glove compartment.

367
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,676
The L1808 polymer appeals to
a more dubious kind of character.

368
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,595
Everyone except Freddie
who watched from the sidelines, -

369
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,148
- fired and fired, and got better.

370
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,518
Everyone carried and nobody knew.
And we all grew.

371
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,875
It was your idea, Wendy, that
I should fire you from the hip.

372
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,999
As aiming was your business
it worked like a dream.

373
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,319
Slow down, Calamity Jane.

374
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,712
Susan had a revelation too. She
made up a new way of shooting-

375
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,629
- called indirect.
She aimed at a hard surface -

376
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,518
- and make the
bullet ricochet to the target.

377
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,310
It was so much her.
Shy but clever.

378
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,837
Finally, when everyone had
given up hope, her mother died.

379
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,399
Susan cried, but I told her now
she could redecorate the store.

380
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,393
I said she was the Dandy
that had grown the most.

381
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,632
- Walk straight.
- Without any eyes?

382
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,872
Come in.

383
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,748
We should probably shut the door.

384
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,710
The smell's gone.
It smells nice.

385
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,635
- Come back here.
- Right here? OK.

386
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,791
- I can't wait to show you.
- What are you doing?

387
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,590
- Ehm, what are you...?
- They've grown.

388
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,710
My breasts have grown. You
always talk at The Temple about-

389
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,112
- how everybody's growing
and getting better and better.

390
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,796
And I didn't really understand
but I just...

391
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,795
It's like the mind and body
have worked together.

392
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,715
When I carry Lee and Grant, I feel
so powerful. I feel myself growing.

393
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,634
That was not what I had meant
but she was happy.

394
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,759
Huey too was sleeping with a girl.
There was no stopping him now.

395
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,875
He hit on anything that moved.
Only Freddie still got beaten up.

396
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,598
But we expected it to stop when
he could afford to start carrying.

397
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,798
- Maybe we could hang out later?
- Sure.

398
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,431
Yeah? We'll go out. I'll see you
when you get out of school.

399
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,829
All right.

400
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,271
Did you see that?
That's right.

401
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,399
It's the time of the season

402
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,438
when love runs high

403
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,719
in this time give it to me easy

404
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,118
and let me try
with pleasured hands

405
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,193
to take you in the sun
to promised lands

406
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,396
to show you every one

407
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:52,238
it's the time of the season
for loving

408
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,839
When we were in the mood for it
we had a parade.

409
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,511
We wore our Dandy parade uniforms
showing off our true selves-

410
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,195
- without fear of
what others may think.

411
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,156
And under all those colors
was the seriousness of it all.

412
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,471
For me anyway.

413
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,555
And you, Wendy.

414
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,394
I was so happy you were my friend.

415
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,074
My confidante.

416
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,634
You did it!

417
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,314
Firing blind. It's incredible.

418
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,228
- Congratulations, Dick.
- Thank you.

419
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,471
And they gave me a Dandy's
greatest accolade.

420
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,235
Co-co-co-congratulations
D- d-dick!

421
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,316
They congratulated me with the
special Brideshead stutter.

422
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,951
Wendy thanks you, too.
We did this together.

423
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,875
I felt as though you could have
hit that target without me.

424
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,269
One thing's for sure.
I couldn't have done it without you.

425
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,558
But I suppose
that's what friends are for.

426
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,837
To complement each other.

427
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,590
We were one, Wendy.

428
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,239
- Officer Krugsby.
- Hey there, Richard.

429
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,871
- Mind if I come in?
- No, of course not. Please.

430
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,114
Our procession last night may have
been a little provoking. Sorry...

431
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,513
No, no problem. You're a good kid
I've known that for ages.

432
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,709
Guys who like Aunt Mable's chocolate
muffins can't be all that bad.

433
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,397
But I brought this guy with me.
He would like to talk with you.

434
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,519
He's down the hall. Would you give
him a moment of your time?

435
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,431
Sure.

436
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,237
Son... Come here, son.

437
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,791
- What's up, Dick?
- Who is this?

438
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,313
I understood you were old pals.
This is Clarabelle's grandson.

439
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,551
Sebastian!

440
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:12,273
- I think we ought to sit down.
- Go ahead. Take a seat.

441
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,875
You see, young Sebastian here...

442
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,357
Can you not touch that?

443
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,557
Son! All right...

444
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,077
Get over there. The other chair.

445
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,996
Young Sebastian here has got
himself into some nasty trouble.

446
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,514
You understand what I'm saying
don't you? Go on!

447
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:49,869
I blew a guy away.
It wasn't necessarily... my fault.

448
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,873
I understand. We understand.
Nuff said.

449
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,512
He did, and he's in a
probation program now.

450
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,436
He needs somebody his own age
who an be a positive influence.

451
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,594
So I figured he needed a kind of
probation officer, you know?

452
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:17,233
So that he stays away from weapons.
And he wants that person to be you.

453
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,835
- Yeah.
- And I could only agree.

454
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,835
- You're a good kid.
- I can't be a probation officer.

455
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,151
I'm not talking about paper work.

456
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:34,598
You just got to keep an eye on him.
We have to look out for each other.

457
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,800
And Sebastian here
has been a fucking idiot.

458
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,113
I understand you've been friends
and now he's in the program.

459
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,354
- He's been saying you're a moral...
- Moral role model.

460
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,752
- Ever since I was real little.
- What if I can't control him?

461
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,555
What if something got out of hand?

462
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,791
I'm a good person...
I'm good.

463
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,551
- I read the book that you gave me.
- Shut the fuck up!

464
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,512
One word from you
and it's back to jail with him.

465
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,718
- And he will do exactly as I say?
- Of course.

466
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,834
Why else
would I need a probation officer?

467
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,795
- You gotta trust the little guy.
- I don't understand what he means.

468
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,670
But I think we have an agreement.
Why don't we just...

469
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,034
I think we've worked it out.
You're a good boy.

470
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:01,589
Krugsby's plan was that Sebastian
checked in with me once a week.

471
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,554
I decided to trust him
and save him.

472
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,714
For Clarabelle, for Krugsby
for my belief in the little guy?

473
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:17,716
Maybe just to prove that
I could make a Dandy out of him.

474
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,834
A pacifist out of a murderer.

475
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,920
Hello!

476
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,074
Sebastian?

477
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,436
You're here. Come on in.

478
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,871
Well...

479
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,199
- They're waiting in the library.
- The library?

480
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,751
- You don't like reading?
- I got a book once.

481
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,310
It's right down there.

482
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,314
- They're doing the floret.
- Try and get a little more direct.

483
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,709
Floret?

484
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:43,948
OK, that's good. Maybe we
should try the first bit again.

485
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,717
- And... one. That's better.
- Ahem.

486
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,712
Excuse me.

487
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,713
Hi, Sebastian.
Welcome to The Temple.

488
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,870
You caught me in the middle of a
rehearsal. Come and meet the others.

489
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,513
This is Stevie Dandelion. He's
working on a piece of ammunition.

490
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,799
This particular gun
is named Bad Steel.

491
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,595
It's got a shady past.

492
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,752
It refused to fire
at a really dumb moment.

493
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,799
Only because no one ever
looked after it properly.

494
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,356
That's very true.

495
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,398
Is there a problem?

496
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,712
- You're wearing a turban.
- And?

497
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,831
Nothing.

498
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,708
Come on, let's meet the others.

499
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,437
- Take care, Sebastian.
- You too, buddy.

500
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:54,710
Hey, Freddie! Tell Sebastian about
the trick of the Moro warriors.

501
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,793
They tied leather straps around their
testicles before going into battle.

502
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:03,676
The pain used to make them
unstoppable by practically any gun.

503
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,435
They fought 1000 percent.

504
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,274
- That's some percentage.
- They were tough guys, Sebastian.

505
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,557
Take a seat, please.

506
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,435
- I came to check in.
- Yeah...

507
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,590
Here I am.

508
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,470
Your probation officer has nothing
special to tell you at this time.

509
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,950
I just gotta ask if you stayed
away from firearms.

510
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,991
- Yes, I have.
- That's good. Guns are bad news.

511
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,789
- Yeah, they're bad news.
- Well, what do you think?

512
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,431
- You guys are completely nuts.
- That's one way of looking at it.

513
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,832
But it's what we've chosen
to spend our time on.

514
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,152
I actually brought you here to
ask you if you'd like to join us.

515
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,713
Might like to join you guys?

516
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,790
- If I would like to join you?
- That's what I said.

517
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,317
Let me think about it.

518
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,155
- Like hell I would.
- Not even if you could have a gun?

519
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,876
Your job is to make sure
that I don't get one.

520
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,628
If you learn to be a Dandy-

521
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,317
- and you're good enough, I'll make
sure you get the gun you want.

522
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,872
But it will only be here.
And we'll do it our way.

523
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,191
Just show up here every week.

524
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,273
When we all think your attitude
is decent, you'll get that gun.

525
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,239
Is shooting guys in the head decent?
No?

526
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:00,440
Doing it isn't. Not doing it is what
makes us stronger and better.

527
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,114
Can I go now?

528
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,318
Your visit has been satisfactory.
I'll tell Krugsby.

529
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,437
I'll see you here every Tuesday.

530
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,034
Let me take a look at that.

531
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,510
Small but no weakling.
She's one cute chick, man.

532
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,874
More dangerous
than she looks, though.

533
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,798
Doesn't she ever get tired
of your goofing around?

534
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:45,199
Or with you? I'll bet you're way
too nice for her. See you Tuesday.

535
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,229
I stood there for a moment
unable to speak.

536
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:11,189
That self-assured way he held you.
And you enjoyed it.

537
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,832
Just lying there in his hand.
I could see that. Cute girl.

538
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:21,710
I decided that you would never
lay in his palm again.

539
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:27,557
He was coarse and far from our
sophisticated image of a Dandy.

540
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:34,159
"If I'd been a Dandy, I'd be dead,"
he said. Not the guy he shot.

541
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,118
If he hadn't drawn his gun.

542
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,119
He was up all night
so it's no wonder he's sleepy.

543
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,795
- But he's real cute.
- He's cute?

544
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,868
Cute? What do you mean?

545
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,875
- Susan? I think I'm real cute.
- Kind of gorgeous.

546
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,156
He's tough. And sexy.

547
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,310
OK. So...

548
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,838
Gorgeous. I'd always had trouble
seeing whether a man was gorgeous.

549
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,994
I could see that he was strong.
And brown.

550
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,718
I wondered if you had the
same experience as Susan.

551
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,791
That you had shared a flirt.
You and Sebastian.

552
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,873
You have a particular taste
in guys, I can see that.

553
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,790
You like guys with big schlongs.
And I know he has a big schlongs.

554
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,670
You deserve to have your mouth
washed out with soap.

555
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,832
- Hey, Sebastian.
- Christmas comes early.

556
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:52,478
Open it, it's for you.
Go ahead, don't be shy.

557
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,632
A little Christmas gift for you.

558
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,110
- There you go, man.
- Whoa!

559
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,796
There you go.
It's what they had in the window.

560
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,599
I'm a nice guy, you know.

561
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,399
It's the nicest thing
anybody could ever do.

562
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:15,828
No more talk about that gun down
town. Is that it? It was real cheap.

563
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,033
- The 7.65 mm model 1900 automatic.
- Hey, hey, hey!

564
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,509
I was tired of seeing Freddie being
beat up. Dandies don't get beat up.

565
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:34,277
- Ain't that right, Dicky?
- Yeah, I guess so.

566
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:39,115
That's the nicest thing. I can't
even believe these other guns.

567
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,679
That's how I do it, girl.

568
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,312
Do you, Freddie Dandelion
take this firearm -

569
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,678
- in respect and honor
till death do you part?

570
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,799
- I do.
- Perform the ritual.

571
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:12,675
With these guns as witnesses, I hereby
wed thee, Freddie Dandelion, -

572
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,672
- to this firearm.

573
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:26,316
Co-co-co-congratulations
F- f-f-freddie!

574
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,152
And...

575
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,679
- Woman. Her name is Woman.
- Wo-wo-wo-woman!

576
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:10,272
Dear Wendy
Sebastian was a hero.

577
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:15,673
During the ceremony for Freddie and
Woman I couldn't take it anymore.

578
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,594
I had to fight him.
But in a Dandy way.

579
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,595
Sebastian hadn't been in the target
shaft. He had never seen us shoot.

580
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,200
He'd never seen me shoot.

581
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,716
That would be the perfect
Dandy way to show him-

582
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,678
- who had the upper hand.

583
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:58,239
All I had to do was to get up there
in front of the targets, -

584
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,677
- pick you up from the partners'
waiting area with its blue velvet, -

585
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,878
- and show off a few rounds
of relaxed hip shooting.

586
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,633
And Sebastian would be blown away.

587
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:17,395
Sebastian! What are you doing?

588
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,319
Never touch another Dandy's gun.
That's rule number one.

589
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,316
- My fault, boss.
- Why don't you just go?

590
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,837
We don't want you here!
You come here and ruin everything!

591
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,754
- At least he can aim.
- I don't care!

592
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,476
- Susan, give me a scarf.
- Dick...

593
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,633
I really think this is a bad idea.

594
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,431
It's not nice to Wendy.

595
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,752
Could I hear you, Wendy?

596
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,674
Maybe I did sense some doubt
about our connection.

597
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,436
But now it's time.

598
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,513
It's you, Wendy... and me.

599
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,236
- Hi.
- Hi again, Dick. How are you?

600
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:03,111
I'm working on an idea that
would be right up Bad Steel's street.

601
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,637
I came back to ask you to
perform a repair.

602
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,838
- It's the sight.
- Does it need adjusting?

603
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,469
You don't use the sight
you fire from the hip.

604
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,156
That's exactly why I want it removed.

605
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:25,633
I don't get it.
That's a very radical alteration.

606
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,635
The sight is a major part of the
personality. You said so yourself.

607
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,111
I've wanted it removed
for a long time.

608
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:41,753
But if you don't use the sight
why should you care?

609
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:46,636
- Only because others might use it.
- What are you talking about?

610
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,793
This has got nothing to do
with Sebastian.

611
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,393
- I didn't mention Sebastian.
- No. Are you gonna do it, or not?

612
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,830
Wendy's my gun.

613
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,794
I exchanged you for Emily.

614
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:07,519
I closed myself up in the library, -

615
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,876
- pretending to study my favorite
handbook on exit wounds.

616
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,789
And not one of the Dandies
came up to comfort me.

617
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,551
Until one did.
And as surprising as it sounds, -

618
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,473
- it was Sebastian.

619
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,159
Come on down, man.

620
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,837
We're all worried about you.

621
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,833
I've never liked you, Sebastian.

622
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,116
What do you have
that I don't have?

623
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:06,513
Maybe you're not
very good at understanding women.

624
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,832
Or little lady revolvers
for that matter.

625
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:19,277
In my experience, women may like
words, but they quickly forget them.

626
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,390
- They want a bit of action.
- It's obvious that you'd say that.

627
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,871
This pacifist stuff is real fancy
but it's easy too.

628
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,748
I don't see it that way.
The others don't, either.

629
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:40,678
Shut up. You might as well say
"I'm scared, I'll carry a gun."

630
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,230
- I'm not scared.
- You sure as hell are.

631
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,279
So am I. So is everybody else.

632
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,875
The kids downstairs are scared too.

633
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,711
Clara... Clarabelle is scared.

634
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:00,236
Clarabelle?

635
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,199
Clarabelle, as in your grandma?

636
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,671
She suddenly got real old.
She can't remember a damn thing.

637
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,678
She doesn't even dare to
go outside her door anymore.

638
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:20,118
The last few years she's only been
out on one single day a year.

639
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,876
One day.
On Cynthia's birthday.

640
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,195
But she doesn't dare, this year.

641
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:36,310
She thinks these gangs will kill her
steal her coffee, rob her...

642
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:44,433
Which is obviously a delusion.
She lost it, man.

643
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,752
Dear Wendy
An idea for a plan appeared to me.

644
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:53,595
A plan that would prove that the
Dandies were not just about words.

645
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,310
Proof. For them.
And for you, Wendy.

646
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,157
Hi. Please come in.

647
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:23,238
We're going to have an exercise.
An important exercise.

648
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:29,156
Sebastian told me there's an
old woman living on the square.

649
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,518
She wants to visit her cousin
but is too scared.

650
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:40,119
We're going to prove to that the
strength of the Dandies exists...

651
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,315
...and is completely intact.

652
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:53,679
Through our presence, the old lady
who is Sebastian's grandmother...

653
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,752
- Really?
- Yeah.

654
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,350
She will have the courage to
cross the square.

655
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:06,276
Our strength will rub off on her.

656
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:12,754
And after this exercise I think we'll
believe in everything a lot more.

657
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,798
And besides
it'll be a good deed.

658
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,829
Your granny?
The lady with the giant purse?

659
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,596
- Huge purse.
- How awful. Not daring to go out.

660
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,355
- It's terrible.
- Will our partners be with us?

661
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,195
They will come along
as our moral support.

662
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:44,435
- So what's our strategy?
- Well, I have a few ideas.

663
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,799
We're here.
Opposite here is Susan's store, -

664
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,792
- the new mine and the old mine.

665
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:58,871
Clarabelle lives here. It's simple.
We'll take her through the Swamp, -

666
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,796
- through East Side, Slope Corner
and the Shack to Cynthia's here.

667
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,750
Freddie and Woman will stand here
for Clarabelle's safe arrival.

668
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:15,516
Susan's Lee and Grant can keep
a sharp lookout down the street.

669
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,752
Huey and Lyndon can create
peace and stability in East Side, -

670
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:24,636
- Stevie and Bad Steel can cover
the long corners from Center Pole.

671
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,712
Come here. Take a look.

672
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,709
Sebastian, you're going to be
with me at Clarabelle's.

673
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,834
Huey, you'll be in Zone 6
in front of the Swamp.

674
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,715
Stevie, you can take Zone 8.

675
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,430
They all looked at Electric Park
which they knew so well, -

676
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,594
- and saw the square in a new light
as their square again.

677
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:54,117
And it made us Dandies once more.
And together.

678
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,318
So that's the plan.
Is everyone agreed?

679
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:19,230
Cynthia had the coffee pot and the
cake ready for Clarabelle's visit.

680
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:25,634
Down on the square, the Dandies
were ready to ensure her safety.

681
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:29,679
So there was no need to worry.
This was an absolutely normal day.

682
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,750
- Hi. We're ready downstairs.
- It's Dick!

683
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:43,239
Hi, Clarabelle.
Do you remember me? Dicky?

684
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:48,474
- I don't remember a damn thing!
- Should we go?

685
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,597
- We should go.
- OK.

686
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:56,231
The Imperial coffee.
It's a beautiful day outside too.

687
01:08:56,320 --> 01:09:00,791
Don't worry, Clarabelle.
Nothing is going to happen.

688
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,509
Don't forget the keys, man.

689
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,990
Let's go, Mommy.

690
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:14,599
- All right... watch your step.
- Oh!

691
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,911
It's gonna be all right.

692
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,710
Oh dear...

693
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,758
You're doing good, Clarabelle.

694
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,912
See the window? It's right there.

695
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,110
- My bag.
- Nobody is going to touch your bag.

696
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,871
Look, it's Cynthia.

697
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,949
I got my bag...

698
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,632
- Oh!
- Hey!

699
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,474
Ma'am! Let me help you get up.

700
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,829
- Leave me alone!
- I'm just trying to help.

701
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,115
Stop, stop, stop!

702
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,838
Dear Wendy
this was a huge fuck-up.

703
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,317
I know Clarabelle never
claimed to be a Dandy, -

704
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:41,359
- and she clearly
wasn't exactly a pacifist.

705
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,716
But this was far from
what I had ever imagined.

706
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,112
This is a mistake, Krugsby!
A big misunderstanding.

707
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,796
Shit!

708
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,312
What are you running around
shooting people for?

709
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,188
- Let's go, let's go!
- Come on, Huey.

710
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:07,795
I'm gonna get the door, don't worry.

711
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,550
All right, I got it.
Everybody good?

712
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,149
I talked to Krugsby.
It's all arranged.

713
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:31,550
If he can have Clarabelle
we can keep our guns.

714
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,879
We're good.

715
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:46,550
Freddie had a
secret talk to Krugsby.

716
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:51,668
They decided to stop the whole thing
before it got out of hand.

717
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,197
Krugsby would pick up Clarabelle
so he could put her in a home.

718
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:02,799
And nothing would happen to us.
I was a good guy, Krugsby said.

719
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,876
Hey there, Richard.

720
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,829
We got ourselves a heck of
a mess, haven't we? Don't worry, -

721
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,276
- I'm gonna deal with it.

722
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:35,115
I just have to ask you
to give me over granny there.

723
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,790
I know you, Richard.
You're a good kid.

724
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,793
We're not all that different.

725
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,237
You're the kind of boys
this country was built on.

726
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,710
Clarabelle, I'm really sorry.

727
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,878
Things have just turned out this way.

728
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,713
Hey, Krugsby!

729
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:17,797
I want to thank you so much for
saying that we can keep our guns.

730
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:25,389
They mean a lot to us. A lot of
people wouldn't appreciate it.

731
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:30,998
But I can see you have a
real special gun yourself.

732
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,039
Don't you?

733
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,868
I do. It's a 08 polymer.

734
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,870
Never trust a man with a
smart-ass L 1808 polymer.

735
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:50,239
This here has been and will be
with me right to the end of the line.

736
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:56,078
- It's just the way I am.
- That's a treacherous gun.

737
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:05,875
And I am fine with it.
Hell, I'd be happy to join myself.

738
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,709
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

739
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,514
Unit!

740
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,037
Regroup!
Catch them, all right!

741
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,832
- Come on, move!
- Get her in here.

742
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,472
- Turn the light off!
- Shhh!

743
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,356
We made it back. But it didn't sound
like they were in a better mood.

744
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,599
- They're destroying the Temple.
- Shhh!

745
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,832
We were still there
the next morning.

746
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:10,592
I got Stevie to check
if you were still on the wall.

747
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:17,392
But you were gone. By now you'd
be in some stupid cop's pocket.

748
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:22,031
I'd failed to protect you, but I
don't suppose you were surprised.

749
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,550
Being holed up down here
it's ridiculous.

750
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:46,555
Spending my life in the mine was
precisely what I didn't want to do.

751
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:55,194
Things are pretty fucked up.
And this is in nobody's interest.

752
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:03,999
Listen. I think everyone here
should do what they want to do.

753
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,229
But I intend to deliver that coffee.

754
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:19,594
- What are you gonna do?
- What a decent American should do.

755
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,229
I'm gonna escort Clarabelle
to her cousin's.

756
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:30,631
And...
and let them become aroused?

757
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,075
Yeah.

758
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:41,312
Or alternatively, leave our
partners with the authorities-

759
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,676
- and forget about the Dandies.

760
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:58,474
OK, I'm not one of you guys
and you guys know that.

761
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:03,873
You guys are crazy
and you're going to get killed.

762
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:10,714
But I'll back you up, as long as I don't
have to take two in the back -

763
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,151
- and sacrifice myself
for some cause.

764
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:30,754
The rest of them gave in to this
fateful logic. They were scared.

765
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:36,517
But they agreed to do like the tribe
Freddie always talked about.

766
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,149
The one that prepared for battle
by cutting themselves.

767
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:46,190
Their fear of being hit disappeared.
They crossed the barrier themselves.

768
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,589
On three. One, two, three.

769
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,788
Give me some more shells.

770
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,952
- We're all going up together.
- Can't go that way.

771
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,269
So, dear Wendy...

772
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:12,754
This is the time of year that I
first picked you up in the toy store.

773
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,998
And now it's time to say goodbye.

774
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,710
I miss you.
And what is about to happen-

775
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,759
- would have been more proper
with you by my side.

776
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:32,876
But that's the way it is. No matter
how much we'd like it to be, -

777
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,396
- not everything can be dandy.

778
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:42,316
Eternally yours
Dick Dandelion.

779
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:49,114
Here is a little extra note, Wendy.

780
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:54,552
I'm going out now, and I fear
the bullets from those guns.

781
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,677
It is ironic.

782
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,073
Because if it had been yours
I would have met them gratefully.

783
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:10,752
I always dreamed that if anyone
should make an exit wound in me, -

784
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,156
- it should be you.

785
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,072
The one that made me feel strong.

786
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:25,829
I fear the other bullets.
But not yours, Wendy.

787
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:31,836
And now: It's the time
of the season for loving.

788
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:45,438
It's the time of the season

789
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,230
when love runs high
in this time

790
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,596
give it to me easy

791
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:58,231
and let me try
with pleasured hands

792
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,359
to take you in the sun
to promised lands

793
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,476
to show you everyone

794
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:10,795
it's the time of the season
for loving

795
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,188
Dick?
You said it was up to each of us.

796
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:21,752
- I want to go first.
- It's best if we stay together.

797
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,918
After all, that was the plan.

798
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:32,957
I'm done with being a loser, Dick.

799
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,680
OK.

800
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,548
Huey and Lyndon go first.
Clear Zone 9.

801
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:45,792
We follow after them. Let's go.

802
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:17,150
- It's Krugsby.
- We won't need any reinforcements.

803
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:22,758
I can bring these rodents to
their senses in three seconds flat.

804
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,593
Absolutely, sir...

805
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,879
- There he goes.
- What?

806
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,829
- Marshall Walker is on his way here.
- The Marshall Walker?

807
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,314
Yeah.

808
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,030
Easy, boys.

809
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,756
Easy, boys. Easy.

810
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,638
Hi, everybody.

811
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,955
I just want to say that
we don't want any trouble.

812
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:52,840
We're not interested in shooting
anybody. So don't make us.

813
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:58,472
We're gonna deliver some coffee
and take our guns home.

814
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:08,232
Son, what are you doing
squaring off with us?

815
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,791
I've had enough of this
trigger-happy bullshit, all right?

816
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,358
You drop that pathetic gun
right this minute!

817
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,598
Beautiful...

818
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,795
- Marshall, we got a situation.
- Stand down.

819
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:34,676
Take it easy, boys.
I'll handle this.

820
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:00,791
Now, son...

821
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:06,238
I'm going to give you
a piece of advice.

822
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:15,348
Listen to me! Drop that
pathetic gun right this minute!

823
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,431
Wake up, Lyndon.

824
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,390
Step back, step back.

825
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,230
Officer do-do-down, I'm afraid.

826
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,717
Let's move forward. Freddie, take
Zone 4, Susan, you follow me,

827
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,155
Stevie too.

828
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,958
Here I come, Krugsby!

829
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,192
Fire!

830
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,989
Clarabelle got hit in the leg!

831
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:06,114
Hey! I can walk.

832
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,833
Guys!

833
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,833
Guys! Look, I can walk.

834
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,191
Fire!

835
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,478
Can you see anything?

836
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,319
Jesus Christ!

837
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,154
Regroup!

838
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,516
Hey! The Ferris wheel stopped.

839
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,991
There's a sniper.

840
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,750
132 yards, and there's a light wind
from the northwest.

841
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:39,752
Holy shit!
Stevie, we gotta get moving.

842
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,992
I'll use a 7.63 mm with extra weight.
It should fall about three feet.

843
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:52,438
All set? Cock it.

844
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:55,830
OK... on my count of three.

845
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,713
Wake up, Bad Steel.

846
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,553
Did you get him?
Stevie got him!

847
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,158
Stay low, everybody.
Stay low, stay low.

848
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:33,153
They're over there in the corner.

849
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,391
- What do you see?
- Over there by Shopside.

850
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,597
We gotta go through Slope Corner.
Stay low.

851
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,436
- Freddie, come here.
- Get down, buddy.

852
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,796
We gotta get under cover
behind the Shack.

853
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,870
Everybody ready?
On my count...

854
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,396
One, two, three.

855
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,311
Take them out!

856
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,398
- Hey, Stevie, Stevie...
- We still got a cup.

857
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,951
Susan, they're in your store.
And they smashed the window.

858
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:27,870
You'd just finished making it look
so nice. Go get them, Susan.

859
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,952
- Stay low, baby!
- Get 'em, Susan.

860
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:43,673
Wake up, Lee. Wake up, Grant.

861
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,673
- Got two of them.
- Look out!

862
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,710
Stevie! Whoa! Steve, get down!

863
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,518
Wake up, Bad Steel.

864
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,638
What happened?

865
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:58,471
Stevie's out.
We move to position three.

866
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,639
Ah! My leg!

867
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,718
Is she all right?

868
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,997
- My leg!
- Everybody all right?

869
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,553
Everybody all right?

870
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,509
Dick, what's going on?
Can you see them?

871
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,513
Oh! It's tight down there.

872
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:52,516
- Jesus Christ! Oh, fuck!
- What's wrong? You got hit?

873
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,592
Yeah, it's my turn.

874
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,116
Woman, wake up!

875
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,430
Shit!

876
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,155
He's down.

877
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:52,798
He's all right.
Come on, we have to cross now.

878
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,354
- He's up!
- Come on, Freddie!

879
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,628
Come on, baby.

880
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:01,112
No visual on suspect.

881
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:07,589
- There's only a coffee pot.
- Roger. Stand by.

882
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:16,230
- Y'all regroup now.
- Let's go. One, two! Let's go!

883
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,990
Watch out to the left.

884
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,709
Wendy!

885
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:40,877
Shit, I'm out of here.

886
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:00,715
Dear Wendy, I always dreamed-

887
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,873
- that if anyone should make
that one final exit wound in me, -

888
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:09,551
- it should be you. My savior.

889
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,190
Stupid, stupid...

890
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:30,276
...the way I feel inside
my heart for you

891
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:34,148
would you say that you

892
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,755
would try to love me too

893
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:43,597
in your mind, would you ever be
really close to me?

894
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:46,877
I can tell the way you smile

895
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:51,551
if I feel
that I could be certain then

896
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,474
I would say the things
I want to say tonight

897
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,231
- Pacifichism...
- Pacifism.

898
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:07,758
I'm a forensic pathologist with
a special interest in firearms.

899
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,795
That's a nice gun
you got for Sebastian.

900
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,918
Wendy...

901
01:35:39,918 --> 01:35:49,918
