1
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,245
Come in.

2
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:30,387
William Kessel...
The producer of this motion picture...

3
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:33,547
...has a question for you.

4
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:35,397
Do you believe in ghosts?

5
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:37,124
Some people believe in them.

6
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:38,722
Others do not.

7
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,605
Personally I do.

8
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:43,745
And I feel sure that when you leave this theatre...

9
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:46,488
...you too will believe in ghosts.

10
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:49,613
Uh...no more dictation today.

11
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:54,335
Now when you came in...
you were given a special ghost viewer...

12
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:55,913
...like this.

13
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:58,609
And here's how it works.

14
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:01,796
Would you please change the color of the screen?

15
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,460
Thank you.

16
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:08,225
You must only use it, when the screen
changes to this kind of a blueish color.

17
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:13,585
...then you raise the viewer to your eyes,
and you look at the screen through it.

18
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:19,079
If you believe in ghosts,
you look through the red part of the viewer.

19
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:24,491
If you do not believe in ghosts,
you look throught the blue part.

20
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:27,723
Would you please change the color again?

21
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:30,165
Thank you.

22
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:32,826
Now when the screen resumes it's normal color...

23
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:33,891
...like this...

24
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:39,611
....remove the viewer from in front of your eyes...
until the next time the screen becomes blue.

25
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:41,631
Oh.  One more thing.

26
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:47,662
If someone sits down next to you, during the picture...
it would be helpful... if you would show him or her...

27
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:50,164
...how the viewer should be used.

28
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:53,269
And remember...if you
believe in ghosts...

29
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,619
....look through the red part.

30
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:59,925
If you don't believe in ghosts...
look throught the blue.

31
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:03,967
Happy haunting.

32
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:05,877
Good bye for now.

33
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:08,208
Shall we go?

34
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:22,088
The La Brea tar pits became
traps for all kinds of animals.

35
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,067
They would either wonder out on the tar
or be driven into it by their enemies.

36
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:30,970
The tar would trap them and slowly kill them.

37
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:35,203
Now, some of you are going to ask:
How did birds get into the pit?

38
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:40,985
The Vultures and condors fed on whatever
had the misfortune to be trapped.

39
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:44,384
And sometimes the birds themselves
got caught in the tar...

40
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:46,991
... And were pulled down to thier death.

41
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:53,199
If any of you would like to see where
these birds and animals came from...

42
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:56,371
... the pits are in the Wilshire district of Los Angeles.

43
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,062
Go over there sometime and try to imagine...

44
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:04,144
... what it was like 40,000 years ago,
when monsters like these...

45
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:08,807
... wandered around, where now
expensive cars roam.

46
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,543
Why did huge beasts...

47
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:15,156
...so much more powerful than man...

48
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:18,094
... disappeared from the face
of Earth, while man...

49
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:21,197
... a relatively puny thing, survived?

50
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,391
Psst.

51
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,470
Excuse me.  Just a moment.

52
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:35,380
- What's the trouble, Mr. Van Allen?
- You're wife's on the phone.

53
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:38,517
But I'm lecturing.
I told her that.

54
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:41,886
Will you take over for me, Ben?
Yes, of course.

55
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,820
Oh, Cy... where are you?

56
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:48,792
Explaining how man survived the Pleistocene Age.

57
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:51,723
How did he?

58
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:53,666
And why?

59
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,847
Hello honey.  What's the trouble?

60
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:10,384
The moving men are here, and they're
taking the furniture away, again.

61
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:15,215
Won't they wait?
No, they won't wait.

62
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:19,761
Not even til tomorrow?
The payments are three months overdue now.

63
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:25,302
Three months? I distinctly remember...
Somehow you didn't make the payments, Cy...

64
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:29,340
...But if we can make them now,
plus a month in advance....

65
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,004
Let's do that.

66
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,943
How much money do we have in the bank?
About 2 dollars.

67
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:37,580
Hmm.  I get paid soon.

68
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:41,082
You don't get paid for almost a month,
and we owe it all anyway.

69
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:44,321
Do you suppose Mr. Van Allen...?
- No.

70
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:47,586
Mr. Van Allen doesn't
make much more than I do...

71
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:50,265
... And he's got three children.

72
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:53,131
Oh!   What's the matter?
Nothing.

73
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:57,898
Good thing we own the mattresses.
Did you get Buck a birthday present?

74
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:02,238
Ah, Yeah, yeah.
Don't forget to bring it.  Bye.

75
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:03,709
Bye honey.

76
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:14,457
Why do they always take our furniture?

77
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:18,994
Because your father is a wonderful
man....just forgetful.

78
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,033
Like me?
Like you, Buck.  Sometimes.

79
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:36,647
Well the rats and the prends are just useful anyway.
Socks and things.

80
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:38,813
You gave him that one?

81
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:41,849
Oh there's nothing wrong with ghost stories, daddy.

82
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:46,688
Unless that's all you read.
He's got every spooky book ever printed.

83
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:55,513
Ow!  Hey!

84
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:57,940
Do you believe in ghosts, Buck?
Sure.

85
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:01,044
You want some cake?
Cake?

86
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,609
Oh, yeah, yeah.

87
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:09,877
No no no.  You've got to make a wish first.
I already have.

88
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,752
Well, how will anybody know if
your wish comes true, if you don't wish out loud?

89
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,689
Suppose I don't want to anyone to know.

90
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,059
Then you wished for something bad.
I have not, Medea.

91
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,826
Well, If you can't wish out loud,
then there must be something wrong with it.

92
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:25,130
Don't you want us to know what you're wish is, darling?

93
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:32,378
I wished we had a house with furniture,
that nobody could take away from us.

94
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:09,217
Mr. Cyrus Zorba?

95
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,551
A telegram for you.

96
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,718
"With regards to matter of great importance to you...

97
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:46,454
... you are requested to present yourself
in the office of attorney Benjamin Rush...

98
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:50,794
... tomorrow morning at 10 oclock.
Signed, Benjamin Rush"

99
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:53,801
Who?
Benjamin Rush, attorney.

100
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:57,033
Well it's not anybody we owe.
At least I don't think so.

101
00:09:57,242 --> 00:10:00,212
Could be the lawyer from a collection agency.

102
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:02,347
Oh.  Could be.
What are you going to do?

103
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:05,711
Go. What else?
Suppose you just run away?

104
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:08,786
Why run away, before you find
out what's chasing you?

105
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:12,254
Well, I read about a man waited to find out...

106
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,054
... But he never did, because it ate him.

107
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:19,567
Benjamin Rush, attorney at law.

108
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:21,964
Ooh, he's in the Petro building.

109
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,099
You have'nt done anything you
could be arrested for, have you daddy?

110
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:27,640
No.

111
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:31,341
Not lately.

112
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:44,624
So, you inherit the house,
which is the bulk of the estate.

113
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:46,995
- Furnished?
- Ah, yes.

114
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:50,635
It's pretty old-fashioned, but is furniture.

115
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:53,168
Is Buck pshycic or something?
Ma'am?

116
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:58,772
Our ten year old son, Buck.
His birthday wish was for a house with furniture.

117
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:02,004
Yeah.
What sort of a house is it?

118
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:04,741
I affraid you're gonna be
disappointed, Mr Zorba.

119
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:09,082
It's one of those sprawling old
mansions they built 50 years ago.

120
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,522
Well, that's better than a third
mortgage and no furniture.

121
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:15,721
Well, don't decide to move in until you've seen it.

122
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:18,264
Here's the key and the address.

123
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:21,367
This is really strange.

124
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:26,271
I thought my uncle  died
10, 12 years ago in India or someplace.

125
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:28,968
No.  He died here last week.

126
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:33,309
Everything about your uncle was strange.
Including his will.

127
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:36,745
Is that the rich uncle you used to
talk about before we got married?

128
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:40,221
Uh huh.  And he's been here,
in Los Angeles, all these years...

129
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:42,921
... And didn't let me know?

130
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:45,859
Well, he wanted the world
to think he was dead.

131
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,191
He left you this, too.

132
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:01,204
What is it?
I don't know.

133
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,087
Is this all?  The house and the
package?   No other...

134
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:11,488
Well there's no money, if that's what you mean, Ma'am.
Dr. Zorba must have been quite wealthy, at one time.

135
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:14,253
Apparently, he spent it all on his experiments.

136
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:18,093
I seem to remember he was fooling around with the occult.

137
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:21,737
Spirits from the other world.
Ghosts.

138
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:25,397
Dr. Zorba  collected ghosts
from all over the world.

139
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,008
You inherit them, too.

140
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,640
Come on.

141
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,345
They go with the house.

142
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,389
I'll get a notary.

143
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:49,300
Cy, this is too much.

144
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,994
A mysterious uncle rising from the grave...

145
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:55,973
... The old mansion, complete with ghosts.
Is it a gag?

146
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:59,306
I did have an uncle named Plato Zorba.

147
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:02,312
And here's his last will and testament.

148
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:07,387
I want to see what's in the package?
Wouldn't it be lovely if it was just full of stocks or bonds.

149
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,115
Or just plain money.
Yeah.

150
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:14,058
Think we ought to open it?
Well, he said it was yours.

151
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:22,705
Suppose it has to do with those experiments.

152
00:13:22,907 --> 00:13:27,571
You know.  You open the box and
all that trouble comes out.

153
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,076
Pandora.

154
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:32,944
It's probably a hand painted Christmas tie.
Open it.

155
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,830
You open it.

156
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,754
Oh, hi.
Hello.  Are you Buck?

157
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,200
Yeah.

158
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:14,388
I'm Ben Rush.
You're the lawyer.

159
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,867
Uh Hm.  Are you all moved in?

160
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:20,869
Wasn't anything to move, except us.
It's a great house.

161
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:23,201
Furniture all over....books.

162
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:27,106
There's a lot of it I haven't even seen yet.
It's got ghosts.

163
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:29,339
So I hear.
Know about em'?

164
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:32,575
Well, I've heard a lot about em'.
You ever seen one?

165
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,721
No.  Is your father home?

166
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:38,586
He will be soon.  We got a witch too.
A live one?

167
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:41,557
Go ring the bell.
She'll come to the door.

168
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:52,830
Oh, shucks.
What did you have to open the door for?

169
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:54,977
Couoldn't you wait for the witch?

170
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:58,637
You better stop calling her that,
or she'll cut your tongue out.

171
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:01,283
Hi, i'm Medea Zorba.
Hi.

172
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:03,113
Won't you come in?

173
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,328
I told you.  She's even got a broom.

174
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:18,870
I see what you mean.
You must be Ben Rush, the lawyer.

175
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:19,719
Um hmm.

176
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,869
Mmm.  No skates.  We own this house.
Or do we?

177
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,447
It's your house.
Who's boss around here?

178
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:33,246
In the "no skates" department, I am.
Yeah, that's what I thought.

179
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:44,157
Was the my father's uncle?

180
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:45,093
Um hm.

181
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,228
He was a fine looking man.

182
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:49,868
I never saw him like that.

183
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:53,874
By the time I met him, they'd almost
completely destroyed him.

184
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:55,067
They?

185
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,003
His ghosts.

186
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,677
Oh, Benjamin Rush, attorney at law.
Living in the twentieth century?

187
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,880
Plato Zorba, scientist, same century.

188
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,059
Collected ghosts.

189
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,727
You're not serious?

190
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:15,491
I didn't believe in them any more than you do,
until I'd known him a while.

191
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:19,264
You can take my word for him.
There are ghosts in this house.

192
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:23,308
We're standing here talking as if you
thought we were in the Middle Ages.

193
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:27,240
But if you had seen him as I did...

194
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,677
...back broken...

195
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:32,747
...face torn to shreds...

196
00:17:32,954 --> 00:17:34,855
... lips ripped away...

197
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,187
You really think we inherited a haunted house?

198
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:42,658
I wish your family hadn't moved in.

199
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,768
Oh, hello, Mr. Rush.
Hi.

200
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:48,586
Hi, honey.

201
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:53,003
Here are the rest of those papers,
all signed and notarized.

202
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:57,708
But I... What about the taxes.
The insurance.  This housekeeper?

203
00:17:57,817 --> 00:18:00,479
Why don't we ask Mr. Rush to stay for supper?

204
00:18:00,686 --> 00:18:03,985
Well I'd love to.
Even if you do call me Mr. Rush.

205
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:06,454
I'll tell mother... Ben.

206
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,835
You the head of this department too?

207
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:19,097
You walk down.  You don't slide.

208
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:24,109
You know something?  If you don't watch out,
you're gonna grow up to be a witch.

209
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:34,053
For a guy with no money,
he sure could get complicated.

210
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:38,492
Well, we've got ourselves a house.
The timing was perfect.

211
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:40,186
More coffee, Ben?
No thanks.

212
00:18:40,397 --> 00:18:41,455
Daddy?
Please, dear.

213
00:18:41,665 --> 00:18:45,625
What have youo decided to do about the witch?
We mustn't call her that.

214
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:50,035
It's a perfect name.
You know, I have a feeling she doesn't like me much.

215
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,301
I have a feeling she doesn't like anybody much.

216
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,570
We told her we couldn't pay her,
and didn't need her....

217
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:58,238
... But she asked us if she could stay on
here, til shefound something else.

218
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,214
Practically begged us.

219
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,878
I guess she's got some money of her own.
After all, she lived here for years...

220
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:06,253
... And Dr. Zorba paid her a good salary.

221
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,454
Hey, look what I found.
What does "ui-ja" mean?

222
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:15,933
Why, I haven't seen one of these for years.
It's a ouija board.  See?

223
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,502
"Oui"  French for yes.

224
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:21,005
"Ja" German for yes.

225
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:23,644
How to play it?
Where'd you find it?

226
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:24,865
Over there.

227
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:27,574
I pushed something on the
fireplace and it opened.

228
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:30,018
There's a gadget that goes with it, Buck.

229
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:33,247
I think they call it a  "planchette".

230
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,626
I pushed this.

231
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:47,095
Here it is.

232
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:57,049
Looks like it might be old Latin.

233
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:01,848
How do you use this, Daddy?

234
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:05,148
"Ouija, the mystifying oracle.

235
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,990
Most  modern method of fortune telling.
Anybody want to try?

236
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:16,966
I have a friend at the university who can probably translate this.
I'll take it over to him tomorrow.

237
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:20,267
My boss, Mr. Van Allen,
talks Latin in his sleep.

238
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:22,945
If he can't translate it, no one can.

239
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:27,140
You want your fortune told?
Now, here's how it works.

240
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,419
Everybody puts one finger on this.
Just lightly.

241
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:36,890
Then, somebody asks a question.

242
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:43,359
We all concentrate on it,
and the Ouija will answer it.

243
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,471
Oh, come on Cy.
It will.  It's magic.

244
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:49,438
Come on.  Everybody put a finger on it.

245
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:56,016
Okay.  Just lightly.
Okay.  Now somebody ask a question.

246
00:20:56,217 --> 00:21:00,416
Oh.  By the way.
If you ask a silly question, it won't answer.

247
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:03,949
Ben, you ask a question.
Alright.

248
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,823
Here's the question.
Is Medea in love?

249
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:12,700
Concentrate now.
No cheating.

250
00:21:17,074 --> 00:21:19,838
You see?
It was a silly question.

251
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:23,480
Can I ask a question, Daddy?
All right, Buck.

252
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,978
Lightly.

253
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:29,884
Are there any ghosts in this house?

254
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:45,536
I was pushing toward "No",
but you all ganged up on me.

255
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,970
No, I was helping you, Ben.
And I think this is silly.

256
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:52,772
You don't want to play?
It's rigged.

257
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,438
how can you say that after
what you told me this afternoon?

258
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:58,176
That's a toy.

259
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:03,724
You want to play, Daddy?
I think I'll go along with Hilda and Ben.

260
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:05,326
Let's stop.

261
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:08,094
Do you want to try it with me, Buck?

262
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:13,693
You ask the question, Buck.

263
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:18,471
How many?
How many what?

264
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:20,967
It knows.

265
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:39,099
Thirteen what?

266
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,358
Ghosts.

267
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:47,199
You ask it.

268
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:57,048
Are they going to hurt us?

269
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:16,169
Don't fool around with that thing
anymore, Medea.

270
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:21,912
Let's ask it,  but don't touch it.

271
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:24,647
You ask it.

272
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:28,613
Are they going to kill any of us?

273
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:04,158
Don't ask it when.

274
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:06,020
I don't want to know.

275
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:12,226
But it was just floating in the air.
There was nothing touching it.

276
00:24:12,437 --> 00:24:15,366
There's probably a very
simple explanation for it.

277
00:24:15,374 --> 00:24:18,310
I don't know what it could be.
Oh, Cy.  I'm frightened.

278
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,777
Of what?
A silly game?

279
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,039
Ghosts.

280
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:26,118
Oh now listen, honey.
Maybe Zorba was a very strange man who...

281
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,847
... could see ghosts and do supernatural things.

282
00:24:30,057 --> 00:24:31,319
But we aren't him.

283
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:35,155
We're just ordinary people
who don't have any supernatural powers and...

284
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:38,128
...don't want any.
Here it is.

285
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,130
The codicil 11.

286
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:43,900
If we don't elect to live in this house...

287
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:47,803
... it goes to the state as part of a park system.

288
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:51,906
And once we move in, we have to stay.

289
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:55,313
You mean we can't sell it even if we want to?
Nope.

290
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,422
If we don't live here, it goes
to the state.  Golly.

291
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:03,526
Living in this house make a difference
between sinking and swimming.

292
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:06,459
Just not paying rent
saves half salary.

293
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:09,999
- Cy, why is it so cold?
- I do not know.

294
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:13,931
Window open I guess.
But it's freezing!

295
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:22,410
What's that?

296
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,813
The wind probably.

297
00:25:26,454 --> 00:25:29,014
I'll say goodnight to the children.

298
00:25:29,657 --> 00:25:31,591
Leave the door open!

299
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:33,120
Okay.
Yeah.

300
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,219
- Medea.
Come in.

301
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,554
Hi.
Hi.

302
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:16,302
Old Doc Zorba sure went in
for antiques, didn't he?

303
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:18,834
I sort of like them.

304
00:26:20,715 --> 00:26:24,412
I hope you're not too upset by...
what happened.

305
00:26:24,853 --> 00:26:26,116
Just a game.

306
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:28,722
I know.   Silly, wasn't  it?

307
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:34,894
I think all this spook talk of Ben's
is...got us all imagining things.

308
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,828
Daddy?

309
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:39,331
Yes, darling.

310
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,300
Do you really think there are
ghosts in this house?

311
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:45,868
Oh.  Of course not.

312
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:50,841
Now.  It's time for all pretty girls
to go to sleep.

313
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:53,115
Good night.

314
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:56,352
Don't worry.

315
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,720
I'll leave this open.

316
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:07,366
Fine.

317
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:20,204
All clear on the off spring front.

318
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:23,385
I'm going down and get a book.
Be back in a minute.

319
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:31,625
Thirteen...

320
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:34,825
Thirteen...

321
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,202
Thirteen...

322
00:29:39,171 --> 00:29:41,003
Thirteen...

323
00:33:00,631 --> 00:33:01,996
Any luck?

324
00:33:03,468 --> 00:33:04,764
Luck?

325
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,594
Can't you read it, Van?

326
00:33:06,804 --> 00:33:09,296
Yes I can read it.  It's Latin.

327
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:11,806
Well...What's it about?

328
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:15,676
What's it about?

329
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,399
Cy.

330
00:33:25,526 --> 00:33:29,121
At first I thought your uncle
was another one of those fakes.

331
00:33:30,197 --> 00:33:31,688
But now I'm not so sure.

332
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,827
Here.

333
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,610
I found this in the university publications.

334
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:44,705
It's printed 10 years ago.

335
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:50,012
" The Professor who advertises
for haunted houses...

336
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:52,246
... so he can photograph ghosts ...

337
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:57,053
... is Dr. Plato Zorba,
a scientist of unquestioned repute.

338
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:00,456
Dr. Zorba's experience with ghosts
in many parts of the world...

339
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,726
... convinced him they are
unhappily earth bound ...

340
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:06,996
... because of unsolved problems.

341
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:12,234
Dr. Zorba has perfected a device
with which he can see ghosts...

342
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:16,040
... and is working on a method of
ultraviolet ray photography...

343
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,185
... which will enable him to take
permanent pictures...

344
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,947
... of the supernatural world. "

345
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:27,729
He wasn't a fake.

346
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:32,793
This....this is a record of years
of work in the world of spirits.

347
00:34:33,435 --> 00:34:37,236
If any of this is true,
I don't say all, just any of it...

348
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,070
... then your uncle had penetrated
farther into the supernatural...

349
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:43,472
... than any man in history.

350
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,915
He captured 11 ghosts.
Captured?

351
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:54,154
Dr. Zorba proved, that if you could see
a ghost, you could control it...

352
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,186
... to a certain extent.

353
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:03,860
Yes, I think so.

354
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:09,771
There is a section describing exactly how
he made the lenses for those glasses.

355
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,569
It took him years.

356
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,906
And then traveled all over the world.

357
00:35:14,848 --> 00:35:17,910
He found one ghost in a castle in Ireland.

358
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,486
Another one in the catacombs below Rome.

359
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:23,624
He caught one in a village in Italy.
Another one in Tibet.

360
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:28,392
I wonder which ones I saw last night.

361
00:35:29,732 --> 00:35:32,327
Each ghost has a separate section.

362
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:35,632
This is the last one...

363
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:38,398
... Ghost 12.

364
00:35:39,543 --> 00:35:40,703
You said 11.

365
00:35:42,213 --> 00:35:43,475
Twelve.

366
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:48,084
"I, Plato Zorba, am the 12th...

367
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:50,686
Earth bound not for the crimes I've committed...

368
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:53,153
... but for crimes
committed against me...

369
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,386
... and which I shall revenge
before I be released...

370
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,563
... from haunting the Earth ".

371
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,802
And here's a curious thing...

372
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:06,265
he wrote, "ghost 13".

373
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:09,069
The rest of the page is blank.

374
00:36:13,248 --> 00:36:15,240
Paleontology. Van Allen.

375
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,185
Yes.  Hold on.

376
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,910
Oh.  Hello?

377
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:21,445
Cy?  I want you to come home.

378
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:23,955
I'm pretty busy, honey.
What's the trouble?

379
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:29,058
There is no use trying to tell you.
I want you to come home right away.

380
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,694
Cy?
I'm on my way.

381
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:34,630
I've got to go home, Van.
The ghosts?

382
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:38,665
I don't know.

383
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:40,572
Have they hurt anyone?

384
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:43,305
I don't know.

385
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:22,044
Hilda?

386
00:37:23,894 --> 00:37:25,014
Hilda!

387
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,300
Hilda!

388
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,728
You.. you alright?

389
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,532
The kids?

390
00:37:34,038 --> 00:37:35,198
Well then?

391
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:37,135
You come in here.

392
00:37:45,618 --> 00:37:46,779
Well, what happened?

393
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:49,547
They came off the shelves and broke.

394
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:52,022
You mean they..they fell off?

395
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:54,421
They came off!

396
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,414
I've had enough, Cy.

397
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,460
Stop it!   Stop it I say!

398
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:35,199
That was Emilio.

399
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:36,605
Who?

400
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:40,972
Emilio. He was an Italian chef.
They killed his wife.

401
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:44,275
He killed his mother in law too.
And his sister in law.

402
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:46,452
With a meat cleaver.

403
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:48,329
Whack.  Whack.  Whack.

404
00:38:48,523 --> 00:38:50,252
You better stand over there.

405
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:53,758
What for?

406
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:56,394
He doesn't mess up the kitchen often...

407
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,193
... But when it does, wow!

408
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:04,766
Now Emilio is through.

409
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:07,772
Now I'm through.

410
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,508
Who told you all this?

411
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,950
The witch. Elaine.
She knows alot we don't know.

412
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,055
Like what?
- Well...

413
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:23,194
... She knows most of the ghosts.
She's even seen some of em'.

414
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:25,990
She's about the creepiest
person I've ever met.

415
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:27,928
Don't you think so?

416
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:31,262
Well, she's uh...different.

417
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:35,172
Maybe she one of the ghosts herself.
What then?

418
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,170
Ooohhh.

419
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:43,043
Suppose they hurt one of the children.

420
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,014
I don't think they would.

421
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,121
A few more inches and that cleaver
would have cut off your head.

422
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:49,756
And look at the burn on your hand.

423
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:53,326
So how can you say that they won't
hurt Buck or Medea, or you again?

424
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:55,360
Things will calm down, Hilda.

425
00:39:55,564 --> 00:39:58,965
Oh, Cy, let's get out of here.
We're in danger.

426
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:04,473
You sent for me?

427
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:06,165
Yes, Elaine.

428
00:40:12,517 --> 00:40:15,180
There are some questions
I'd like to ask you.

429
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:18,151
How long did you
work for Dr. Zorba?

430
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:19,517
For many years.

431
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:22,489
You knew about his experiments
with the supernatural?

432
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:24,060
I helped him.

433
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:27,927
When he was alive,
he could control them, but now...

434
00:40:28,268 --> 00:40:29,736
I'm afraid...

435
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,563
I never was before...

436
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,568
... But now I am.

437
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:37,510
I can't help feeling that
our living here...

438
00:40:37,712 --> 00:40:40,246
... everything that
has happened to us

439
00:40:40,247 --> 00:40:41,546
is all part of a plan...

440
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,480
... That Dr. Zorba wants
us to do something.

441
00:40:46,723 --> 00:40:47,882
But what?

442
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,917
I can't help you.

443
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:53,755
He used to trust me,
and in those days I helped him...

444
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:55,591
... with the cameras and lenses.

445
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:59,166
But towards the last...
he trusted no one.

446
00:40:59,536 --> 00:41:02,097
Were you and Ben the only friends he had?

447
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:05,640
Ben only.    He turned against me.

448
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,207
He was doing foolish things and
I wanted him to stop, but he would not.

449
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:11,474
His experiments?
Those too.

450
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:15,176
But mainly I objected when he
converted everything into cash.

451
00:41:15,388 --> 00:41:18,221
Stocks, bonds, real estate, everything.

452
00:41:18,858 --> 00:41:21,760
And then he withdrew all his
accounts from the banks.

453
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:23,190
It was foolish.

454
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,524
What did he do with the money?
No one knows.

455
00:41:25,732 --> 00:41:27,359
There is no record of it.

456
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:32,062
Ben and I spent days searching the
house for it after he died, but found nothing.

457
00:41:32,273 --> 00:41:35,731
Maybe he spent it.
On what?  He had everything he needed.

458
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:38,970
Besides, he never left the house.
Maybe he gave it away.

459
00:41:39,615 --> 00:41:42,015
 I knew Plato Zorba very well.

460
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:44,846
He never gave away anything.

461
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:47,113
This house is not a gift, really.

462
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,017
It's a burden.  Perhaps a curse.

463
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:54,863
The last thing he wrote...

464
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:57,830
...was about a crime committed against him.

465
00:41:58,035 --> 00:41:59,970
What did he mean by that?

466
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:01,261
I don't know.

467
00:42:01,973 --> 00:42:05,374
How did he die, Elaine?  And where?

468
00:42:05,577 --> 00:42:07,169
I'll show you.

469
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:10,206
I'll stay here.

470
00:42:31,573 --> 00:42:33,906
This was Dr. Zorba's bedroom.

471
00:42:35,311 --> 00:42:37,404
That is where he died.

472
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:40,681
How did he die, Elaine?

473
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,852
The spirits from the other world.

474
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:46,148
Is that what you told the coroner?

475
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,916
He wouldn't have believed me any more than you.

476
00:42:50,428 --> 00:42:53,592
The official cause of death was suffication.

477
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:56,497
Who saw him last?

478
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,966
I mean, was anyone here
when he died?

479
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:03,199
I was here, in the house, but I
didn't see him that night at all.

480
00:43:03,408 --> 00:43:05,673
He and Ben were working on his will.

481
00:43:05,879 --> 00:43:09,509
Did Ben see him die?
Oh no.  Ben had gone.

482
00:43:09,716 --> 00:43:13,175
Dr. Zorba died sometime later that night.

483
00:43:13,386 --> 00:43:16,686
I found him the next morning there.

484
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,483
What did the police say about it?

485
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:23,562
They talked mostly to Ben.
I called him first.

486
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:30,768
I hated this room.
For years I never came in here.

487
00:43:30,973 --> 00:43:34,670
But that morning I did.
I don't know why.

488
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,678
Something seemed to be pulling me to this place.

489
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:46,981
If you stay here, you too, will learn
not to come into this room.

490
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:50,058
What do you mean,
"if I stay here"?

491
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:54,591
You should get out of this house now!
Tonight!

492
00:46:40,987 --> 00:46:43,922
It was a wonderful evening, Ben.
Thanks.

493
00:46:44,457 --> 00:46:48,258
How about some coffee before you go?
No Thanks.  Not tonight.

494
00:46:48,462 --> 00:46:51,363
I wish you and your family were
staying somewhere else.

495
00:46:51,566 --> 00:46:54,160
This place gives me the creeps.
It always has.

496
00:46:54,368 --> 00:46:55,995
Don't start on that again.

497
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:58,172
I worry about you, Medea.

498
00:46:58,373 --> 00:47:00,864
Just for me, will you try to be a little careful?

499
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:04,376
For you, I'll pull the covers
over my head tonight.

500
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,775
See you tomorrow?
Well, I hope so.

501
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:09,213
Don't worry, Ben.  I'll be careful.

502
00:47:09,752 --> 00:47:12,551
Thanks again. Good night.
Good night.

503
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,712
Daddy, Daddy!

504
00:50:09,722 --> 00:50:11,315
Darling.  Darling.
What happened?

505
00:50:11,523 --> 00:50:13,115
Come in here .

506
00:51:11,224 --> 00:51:12,589
Oh, good morning.

507
00:51:59,979 --> 00:52:01,970
Well, how is she?

508
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:03,671
I'm getting her breakfast now.

509
00:52:03,884 --> 00:52:05,943
godd thing there were some
of those pills left.

510
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:09,817
Did you call Buck?
Yeah.  Yeah, I yelled as I went by.

511
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:56,140
Back you lion, back!
I'm Shadrack the Great.

512
00:52:56,342 --> 00:52:58,833
Back!
Down you lion, down!

513
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:01,012
I'm Shadrack!

514
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:30,406
I met a lion.

515
00:56:30,617 --> 00:56:33,815
That's good.
And a man without a head.

516
00:56:34,087 --> 00:56:35,486
Mmm Hmm
Now you take this to up to Medea, dear.

517
00:56:35,688 --> 00:56:38,317
And then you come back
and eat your own breakfast, hmm?

518
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,256
Morning, Buck.
Hi, Ben.

519
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,328
Medea is in bed.
She saw a ghost last night.

520
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,125
I just saw a lion and a man without a head.

521
00:57:15,634 --> 00:57:17,329
What do you know.
No head at all?

522
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:20,806
I think the lion bit it off
because the man was looking for her.

523
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,937
I've got some papers for your dad.

524
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:25,801
He's gone to work.
I have to bring Medea her breakfast.

525
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:27,238
Buck?
Hmm?

526
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:31,310
Where did you get all that money?
I found it on the floor.

527
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:34,953
When?
Just before you rang the bell.

528
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:38,454
Exactly where did you find it?

529
00:57:40,662 --> 00:57:41,993
Right there.

530
00:57:42,531 --> 00:57:43,623
Exactly?

531
00:57:43,832 --> 00:57:47,496
Somewhere around there.
Think it belongs to some ghost?

532
00:57:47,703 --> 00:57:50,070
Well you found it.
It belongs to you.

533
00:57:50,273 --> 00:57:51,467
You mean I can keep it?

534
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:55,141
Sure.
It was just laying on the floor?

535
00:57:57,181 --> 00:57:58,306
Just those two?

536
00:57:58,882 --> 00:58:00,748
That's a lot of money, $ 200.

537
00:58:01,629 --> 00:58:02,749
Buck.

538
00:58:03,421 --> 00:58:06,219
What were you doing just
before you found the money?

539
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,354
Skating?
No skating in the house.

540
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:12,261
Sliding down the bannister?

541
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:15,060
Are you going to tell Medea?

542
00:58:15,268 --> 00:58:17,931
Well, we're pals.
Don't you know that?

543
00:58:18,137 --> 00:58:20,834
I keep your secrets and you keep mine.
Okay?

544
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:22,107
Okay.

545
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:24,671
But I don't have any secrets.

546
00:58:24,678 --> 00:58:26,236
Well I'll give you one.

547
00:58:26,246 --> 00:58:29,704
You take Medea's breakfast
up to her and then come right back.

548
00:58:29,918 --> 00:58:32,318
And don't tell her I'm here.
Promise?

549
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,714
I can keep a secret.

550
00:58:33,922 --> 00:58:36,983
And don't say anything about
finding the money.

551
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:39,520
I'll be right back.

552
00:59:03,055 --> 00:59:04,852
Here's your breakfast.

553
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:08,757
I just saw a lion and a man without a head.

554
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:10,896
What did you see last night?

555
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:12,894
An apperition.  At the window.

556
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,994
Do we have them too?

557
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:17,432
I guess we're the only family in the whole world...

558
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,663
... with thier own apparition and ghosts.

559
00:59:19,873 --> 00:59:21,204
Why don't you get up?

560
00:59:21,408 --> 00:59:24,606
As long as you bring me breakfast
in bed, why should I get up?

561
00:59:25,714 --> 00:59:28,205
Where's mother?
In the kitchen.

562
00:59:28,717 --> 00:59:29,945
Where's Elaine?

563
00:59:30,152 --> 00:59:32,847
I don't know.  Well, I got to go.

564
00:59:33,421 --> 00:59:34,821
What's so important?

565
00:59:35,024 --> 00:59:36,616
Got to keep a secret.

566
00:59:37,126 --> 00:59:38,992
What secret, Buck?

567
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,372
You didn't tell her?
Nope.

568
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:56,808
Good man.

569
00:59:58,017 --> 01:00:01,714
Now I'm gonna tell you the biggest
secret you ever heard.

570
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:05,049
If you promise not to
tell a living soul.

571
01:00:05,257 --> 01:00:08,352
I won't even tell a ghosts,
and the're not living.

572
01:00:08,628 --> 01:00:10,687
There's a treasure hidden in this house.

573
01:00:11,131 --> 01:00:12,223
Pirates?

574
01:00:12,433 --> 01:00:13,661
Sort of.

575
01:00:13,868 --> 01:00:16,861
Before old Dr. Zorba died,
he hid all his money.

576
01:00:19,374 --> 01:00:20,841
This must be some of it.

577
01:00:21,043 --> 01:00:24,206
Well there's alot more,
and you and I are gonna find it.

578
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:26,506
If Medea will get up,
we'll make her hunt too.

579
01:00:26,782 --> 01:00:28,716
No, no. That's the secret.

580
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,982
You and I are going to find the
money all by ourselves.

581
01:00:32,355 --> 01:00:35,654
Aren't we gonna give dad any?
Or mother or Medea?

582
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:39,386
We're gonna give it all to them.
But let me ask you this...

583
01:00:39,897 --> 01:00:44,664
Suppose we have to uh... maybe
cut a hole in the wall someplace.

584
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:47,497
Now, if you told your dad,
what would he say?

585
01:00:48,206 --> 01:00:50,869
well, he might not understand.

586
01:00:51,076 --> 01:00:54,103
That's why this has to be
just between you and me.

587
01:00:55,514 --> 01:00:57,244
Okay.  When do we start?

588
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,645
First, you've got to hide that.

589
01:01:00,721 --> 01:01:04,919
Next, I've got to make some plans.
And tonight we start.

590
01:01:05,292 --> 01:01:07,727
Maybe I could hunt around some today!

591
01:01:07,961 --> 01:01:10,088
Okay. But be careful.

592
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:14,793
If anybody comes in while you're hunting,
you act like nothing is happening.

593
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:23,244
Now, don't tell anybody about finding the money.

594
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:27,280
And don't tell anybody about the treasure hunt.
and Buck...

595
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,342
... Don't tell anybody I was here this morning.

596
01:01:30,554 --> 01:01:32,886
Right?
Right.

597
01:01:34,272 --> 01:01:35,292
Ben?

598
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:39,318
Suppose somebody asks me...
right straight out...

599
01:01:39,531 --> 01:01:41,362
"Was Ben here today?"

600
01:01:41,867 --> 01:01:45,599
I wasn't here, Buck.
Now that's the way it has to be.

601
01:01:58,786 --> 01:02:00,048
Who was that, Buck?

602
01:02:00,555 --> 01:02:02,044
Huh?
Who went out?

603
01:02:02,557 --> 01:02:06,857
Nobody, Medea.
And besides, it's a secret.

604
01:02:22,146 --> 01:02:23,580
Come in.

605
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,749
Hello, Ben.
If you're busy,  I can come back later.

606
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:29,302
No no.

607
01:02:30,287 --> 01:02:32,727
I'm glad you're here.
I wanna talk to you.

608
01:02:32,728 --> 01:02:33,387
Sit down.

609
01:02:35,828 --> 01:02:39,389
Ben, we've been in that
house two nights.

610
01:02:39,598 --> 01:02:42,363
The first, I got this.

611
01:02:42,568 --> 01:02:45,060
Last night, they attacked Medea.
Medea!

612
01:02:45,438 --> 01:02:46,700
They didn't hurt her.

613
01:02:46,906 --> 01:02:48,841
Why Medea?

614
01:02:48,842 --> 01:02:52,505
Was she wearing those glasses Zorba made?

615
01:02:52,913 --> 01:02:54,608
No.. no she wasn't.

616
01:02:56,917 --> 01:02:58,578
What's going to happen, Ben?

617
01:02:58,787 --> 01:03:01,722
Is my family going to be
terrorized every night?

618
01:03:01,923 --> 01:03:03,914
Maybe this is the answer, Cy.

619
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:05,922
I think I can legally get the state
to pay you for the house and grounds...

620
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:08,753
But the will said...

621
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:10,956
You've only been in the house three days.

622
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:13,161
The longest days in my life.

623
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:16,771
I bet you'll be glad to get
your family out of there.

624
01:03:16,974 --> 01:03:19,841
See, we can say you never
actually took possession.

625
01:03:20,043 --> 01:03:21,908
Now how soon can you move?

626
01:03:22,113 --> 01:03:24,411
Right away,  I guess.
Good.

627
01:03:24,616 --> 01:03:27,483
If I we're you I wouldn't spend
another night in that house,

628
01:03:27,685 --> 01:03:29,414
under any circumstances.

629
01:03:33,659 --> 01:03:36,629
Zorba, Paleontology.
Oh, hi ya, Buck.

630
01:03:38,698 --> 01:03:40,426
Yes, yes.  It's alright.

631
01:03:41,534 --> 01:03:44,765
A secret?
Well, tell me about it, son.

632
01:03:45,972 --> 01:03:49,965
Alright, Buck.   Just as you say.
See you later.

633
01:03:51,646 --> 01:03:53,204
Buck's all excited.

634
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:55,007
Any trouble?

635
01:03:55,217 --> 01:03:56,877
He's got a secret.

636
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,381
A big surprise for me.

637
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:01,681
What is it?

638
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:03,552
He wouldn't tell me.

639
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:08,259
I think you could cut his arm off,
and he still wouldn't tell.

640
01:04:08,465 --> 01:04:11,729
Good kid.
Well,  can you move today?

641
01:04:11,936 --> 01:04:14,700
We haven't much to move, except ourselves.

642
01:04:14,905 --> 01:04:18,603
I think I'll be able to get
you $ 10,000 from the state.

643
01:04:20,277 --> 01:04:22,473
Hey, Cy. This will interest you.

644
01:04:23,114 --> 01:04:25,275
Oh.  So sorry.
I can speak to you later.

645
01:04:25,484 --> 01:04:27,952
No, no, Van.   Stay.

646
01:04:28,888 --> 01:04:32,289
Ben Rush,  this is my boss,  Mr. Van Allen.
How do you do, sir?

647
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:34,323
How do you do.
Listen to this.

648
01:04:34,528 --> 01:04:36,996
Almost the last thing Dr. Zorba wrote.

649
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:40,091
"Today I finished converting
my assets into cash...

650
01:04:40,301 --> 01:04:44,669
... and put it where unscrupulous
men can no longer steal it from me."

651
01:04:45,273 --> 01:04:47,332
I wonder where that is.

652
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:49,476
If he never left the house?

653
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:53,671
Don't forget...he wrote this
about... only a month ago.

654
01:04:54,316 --> 01:04:55,977
What do you think, Ben?

655
01:04:56,185 --> 01:04:58,848
Maybe we shouldn't be in
such a hurry to move.

656
01:04:59,054 --> 01:05:02,422
Well it isn't likely.  I handled Zorba's
affairs for a year.

657
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:06,026
I don't think he could've kept any
large amount of money secret from me.

658
01:05:07,264 --> 01:05:10,631
Well, after reading this, I wouldn't be
surprised at anything...

659
01:05:10,835 --> 01:05:13,327
... natural or supernatural, Zorba did.

660
01:05:13,537 --> 01:05:17,201
For instance, he spoke with the
spirits of the dead like uh...

661
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:19,741
... you and I chat with the grocer.

662
01:05:19,945 --> 01:05:22,346
He and a medium called
Elaine Zacharides...

663
01:05:22,547 --> 01:05:24,277
...used to sit around at a Sance...

664
01:05:24,484 --> 01:05:27,613
... talking with people dead for 5 centuries.

665
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:31,249
All you have to do is find Elaine Zacharides.

666
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:34,450
I don't have to find her.
She's the housekeeper.

667
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:37,760
Would she hold a Sance with you?

668
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:43,037
I don't know.

669
01:05:43,238 --> 01:05:45,968
I doubt it.
She's pretty stubborn.

670
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:49,042
Anyway, you're moving out
so there won't be time.

671
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:52,237
But, if she'd do it, we'd take time.

672
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,009
Maybe..maybe she'd hold a Sance tonight.

673
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:57,152
Then we could move out tomorrow.

674
01:05:58,188 --> 01:06:02,091
If we could bring the spirit of Zorba back...

675
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:05,258
... I wonder what we'd find out.

676
01:06:13,305 --> 01:06:15,068
What's a Sance?

677
01:06:15,374 --> 01:06:17,274
You talk to spirits.

678
01:06:17,977 --> 01:06:20,241
Buck, why don't you go and pack your things?

679
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:22,540
How does it work?
I do not know.

680
01:06:22,749 --> 01:06:24,479
Hand me the dress, will you?

681
01:06:25,185 --> 01:06:28,087
How does Elaine know?
I do not know.

682
01:06:28,389 --> 01:06:30,949
Oh, I'll be so glad to get out of this house.

683
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:33,319
Well, what happens?

684
01:06:34,029 --> 01:06:36,589
Oh, you sit around the table holding hands.

685
01:06:36,797 --> 01:06:39,028
Buck, will please go and help mother?

686
01:06:39,234 --> 01:06:41,031
What good does that do?

687
01:06:41,504 --> 01:06:43,698
The spirits talk to you.

688
01:06:44,073 --> 01:06:46,735
What do they say?
I do not know.

689
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,810
Buck, will you please go!

690
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:52,410
Why pack?
We're not going to anywhere.

691
01:06:52,616 --> 01:06:55,380
You heard dad.
Were leaving first thing in the morning.

692
01:06:55,486 --> 01:06:56,606
Medea?

693
01:06:57,922 --> 01:06:59,115
Yes, Buck.

694
01:06:59,324 --> 01:07:02,760
Suppose you had a secret.
How you would keep it?

695
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,051
You have a secret?

696
01:07:06,999 --> 01:07:08,193
What is it?

697
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,393
Well, it's a...
Hey, I'm not going to tell you what it is.

698
01:07:12,706 --> 01:07:14,905
Well who is it with?
Ben.

699
01:07:14,936 --> 01:07:16,056
Oh.

700
01:07:16,276 --> 01:07:17,868
What's it about?

701
01:07:18,078 --> 01:07:20,546
Well, is it alright to say what it's about?

702
01:07:20,748 --> 01:07:23,979
Sure, as long as you don't tell the secret itself.

703
01:07:24,452 --> 01:07:27,286
Well, you see, Ben and I...

704
01:07:28,523 --> 01:07:30,957
Need any help?
No, I just finished packing, mom.

705
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,857
Good.   If it weren't for this Sance
nonsense, we could leave right now.

706
01:07:35,063 --> 01:07:36,928
I can go to the Sance, can't I mom?

707
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:38,657
Absolutely not.

708
01:07:38,868 --> 01:07:41,200
Aw, I've never been to one.

709
01:07:41,404 --> 01:07:45,465
It'll be fun.
Boy, maybe somebody will get murdered.

710
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:49,643
Well you can't go to this one.
Anyway, it's past  your bed time.

711
01:07:49,847 --> 01:07:51,974
I'll tell you everything that happens.

712
01:07:52,183 --> 01:07:54,879
Yeah well, that's not like seeing it.

713
01:07:57,455 --> 01:08:00,983
Right in here. We're ready to start.

714
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:03,294
Will you sit there, Mr. Zorba?

715
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:06,056
Your wife here, your daughter here.

716
01:08:11,605 --> 01:08:13,664
The most important thing, is concentration.

717
01:08:14,308 --> 01:08:17,574
Let your minds think of nothing
except  bringing back to this room...

718
01:08:17,778 --> 01:08:18,939
... the spirit of Zorba.

719
01:08:19,147 --> 01:08:21,172
We will now join hands.

720
01:08:22,984 --> 01:08:25,078
Cy, do you think this is really necessary?

721
01:08:25,286 --> 01:08:26,549
Please, honey.

722
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:32,384
What can we expect ?
I mean, what will happen?

723
01:08:32,595 --> 01:08:35,792
Perhaps nothing.  Perhaps anything.

724
01:08:37,267 --> 01:08:40,566
Doctor Zorba and I experienced
total recall with some spirits.

725
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:43,467
With others we could
make no contact at all.

726
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:46,541
If he comes back, he
may speak through me...

727
01:08:46,744 --> 01:08:49,042
... or he may choose one of you

728
01:08:49,647 --> 01:08:50,808
One of us?

729
01:08:51,148 --> 01:08:55,984
Yes.   Although I'm the medium,
he may choose one of you.

730
01:08:56,389 --> 01:08:58,380
He may even appear.

731
01:08:58,624 --> 01:09:00,092
There's no way to tell.

732
01:09:01,027 --> 01:09:03,552
What can happen?
I mean, say he does come.

733
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,663
Can we carry on a conversation?

734
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:07,558
It's possible.

735
01:09:08,002 --> 01:09:09,936
Let us try for just a short time.

736
01:09:10,137 --> 01:09:13,801
It's very difficult being a medium.
And dangerous.

737
01:09:14,008 --> 01:09:18,070
Besides, as I told you, Dr. Zorba
no longer trusted me.

738
01:09:18,847 --> 01:09:20,748
Now will you please turn out the lights.

739
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:23,350
And then we must all concentrate.

740
01:09:23,551 --> 01:09:25,986
Just...just a moment, please.

741
01:09:44,409 --> 01:09:45,604
Ready?

742
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:14,968
The treasure!

743
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:20,148
Buck.   You're suppose to be in bed.

744
01:10:21,473 --> 01:10:22,873
I...uh...

745
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,818
All we're doing is sitting around
the table. Nothing is happening.

746
01:10:27,024 --> 01:10:29,549
I'm not trying to see your old ghosts.

747
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,728
I'm waiting for Ben.
We've got a secret.

748
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:34,261
Ben?  He's not coming here tonight.

749
01:10:34,466 --> 01:10:36,593
He might.
Is a pretty big secret.

750
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:40,533
Yes.  You told me.
But it can wait until tomorrow.

751
01:10:41,841 --> 01:10:44,935
Can't I wait up five more minutes,
if I promise not to peek?

752
01:10:45,478 --> 01:10:48,312
Okay. Five minutes.

753
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:58,982
I'm sorry.

754
01:11:02,964 --> 01:11:05,091
Dr. Zorba...

755
01:11:05,367 --> 01:11:07,835
Dr. Zorba...

756
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:25,830
Dr. Zorba...

757
01:11:27,602 --> 01:11:29,002
Dr. Zorba...

758
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,269
Zorba...

759
01:11:44,742 --> 01:11:46,462
Zorba..

760
01:11:51,553 --> 01:11:53,817
In death...

761
01:11:54,489 --> 01:11:56,582
In death...

762
01:11:57,325 --> 01:11:58,815
Do not move!

763
01:11:59,028 --> 01:12:01,155
No matter what happens, do not move.

764
01:13:05,769 --> 01:13:08,363
Ben, I found it!  Come on.

765
01:13:10,874 --> 01:13:12,034
See?

766
01:13:12,243 --> 01:13:14,541
Good work, Buck.  Good work.

767
01:13:15,113 --> 01:13:19,447
Does anybody else know?
Of course not.  Let's tell em'.   Ow!

768
01:13:19,752 --> 01:13:22,618
You're hurting!
Oh, I'm sorry, Buck.

769
01:13:23,022 --> 01:13:24,455
We can't tell anyone yet.

770
01:13:25,024 --> 01:13:26,686
But we're moving out tomorrow.

771
01:13:27,026 --> 01:13:29,494
That's right.  We've got to get ready...

772
01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:32,995
... so when they're all set to go...
bam!  We give them money.

773
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,564
Then we won't have to move.

774
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:37,999
Right.   Now, we got alot to do tomorrow.

775
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:39,797
I think you better turn in, Buck.

776
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:41,907
You know.  Get all the rest you can.

777
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:43,532
I'm not sleepy.

778
01:13:44,412 --> 01:13:46,004
Not sleepy?

779
01:13:46,214 --> 01:13:48,409
I'm gonna be waking 
you so early in the morning...

780
01:13:48,617 --> 01:13:50,108
... the sun won't even be up.

781
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:51,911
We've got work to do.

782
01:13:52,121 --> 01:13:53,213
And then we'll em'?

783
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:56,987
Tomorrow. So, sleep now.

784
01:13:57,327 --> 01:13:59,420
I'm gonna hit the sack myself.

785
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,527
Okay.   Good night.

786
01:14:04,902 --> 01:14:07,667
You can wake me anytime.
I won't mind.

787
01:14:07,871 --> 01:14:09,271
Good night, Buck.

788
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:11,302
Go right to sleep.

789
01:14:47,318 --> 01:14:50,710
Cy!   Help him!
No!  You mustn't!   Stay where you are!

790
01:14:51,721 --> 01:14:56,421
Thirteen, thirteen...

791
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:01,396
Dead tonight...

792
01:15:02,099 --> 01:15:04,567
... One of you...

793
01:15:58,429 --> 01:16:00,091
Are you alright?

794
01:16:03,936 --> 01:16:06,234
Bring him back.  Please.

795
01:16:06,438 --> 01:16:08,303
We must know more.

796
01:16:08,507 --> 01:16:11,773
It is of no use.
There is Interference.

797
01:16:11,978 --> 01:16:14,573
The ghosts are restless, angry.

798
01:16:14,881 --> 01:16:17,646
Tonight death walks again...

799
01:16:17,851 --> 01:16:20,252
... in this evil house.

800
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:15,876
Suddenly I...I  became cold.

801
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:20,112
And for an instant,
I seemed to black out.

802
01:17:20,956 --> 01:17:22,253
And then...

803
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:27,017
... then I heard a strange voice come from me...

804
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:30,695
But I can't remember.

805
01:17:31,034 --> 01:17:33,196
You... I mean the voice said...

806
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:36,669
"Death tonight"
and then the number 13.

807
01:17:36,874 --> 01:17:38,273
And then he...

808
01:17:38,843 --> 01:17:41,073
... he said it would be one of us.

809
01:17:43,849 --> 01:17:47,717
- Where are you going?
Oh.  Just to see if Buck's alright.

810
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:32,870
It's Ben!  It's Ben!
The bed it's hurting him!

811
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:36,909
... 98, 99, hundred!

812
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:39,807
I never thought I'd get tired of this.

813
01:21:42,217 --> 01:21:45,209
Daddy?   Why did Ben
dress as Zorba's ghost...

814
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:48,219
...and appear at my window?
He was trying to frighten you.

815
01:21:48,423 --> 01:21:50,391
He knew this money was hidden here.

816
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:53,187
After he murdered Zorba he tried to find it.

817
01:21:53,395 --> 01:21:56,387
Then we moved in.  He 
wanted us out of here.

818
01:21:56,599 --> 01:21:58,897
Where do you think our new
house ought to be?

819
01:21:59,101 --> 01:22:02,360
New house?
What do we want with a new house?

820
01:22:02,436 --> 01:22:03,836
Boo.  Boo.

821
01:22:04,613 --> 01:22:06,006
Buck!

822
01:22:09,022 --> 01:22:10,742
Buck! Take that thing off.

823
01:22:11,516 --> 01:22:13,040
Can I keep it?

824
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:18,087
Breakfast is ready.
Well,  I'm starved.

825
01:22:22,794 --> 01:22:25,764
Elaine.   Do you think there are
still ghosts is this house?

826
01:22:25,964 --> 01:22:29,924
No.  The earthbound spirits
have been released.

827
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:35,875
Don't you want your breakfast?

828
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,805
I'm guarding the money.

829
01:22:38,013 --> 01:22:39,912
Elaine?
Yes, Buck.

830
01:22:40,115 --> 01:22:42,606
You really are a witch, aren't you?

831
01:22:44,487 --> 01:22:48,354
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

832
01:22:48,724 --> 01:22:51,659
And the ghosts?  They haven't
really gone, have they?

833
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:55,423
They'll be back.
They'll be back.

834
01:22:55,632 --> 01:22:57,395
Real soon, I hope.

835
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:59,285
Now, just a moment before you leave!

836
01:23:59,454 --> 01:24:02,954
If any of you are not yet convinced
there really are ghosts...

837
01:24:02,973 --> 01:24:05,573
...take the supernatural viewer home with you.

838
01:24:05,644 --> 01:24:07,644
And tonight.... when you are alone...

839
01:24:08,231 --> 01:24:10,231
...and your room is in darkness...

840
01:24:10,929 --> 01:24:13,029
...look through the red part of the viewer.

841
01:24:13,252 --> 01:24:14,652
If you dare!
