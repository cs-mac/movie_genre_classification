1
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,938
- Amsterdam, motherfucker.
- Okay.

2
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,871
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

3
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,035
Red-light district. Time for <i>sneepur.</i>

4
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,807
Let's go to the coffee shop first,
then get some <i>sneepur.</i>

5
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,246
Hey, I think the Anne Frank
house is around here.

6
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,184
Did we come to Europe
just to smoke pot?

7
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,880
I came all the way from Iceland.

8
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,652
- Yeah, what if we did?
- We did that every day in college.

9
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,988
Why not, like, you know,
check out a museum?

10
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,131
No, you're right.
We should go to a museum.

11
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,560
How about the hemp museum?

12
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,733
Oli proudly presents..

13
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,402
Isabella.

14
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,839
She's cute.

15
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,379
But we can't rail a girl
who's in a coma.

16
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,813
I think that's illegal
even in Amsterdam.

17
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,886
- Hey, I'm just warming up, man.
- Fucking Oli.

18
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,181
The Icelandic..
Oh, God, how are you?

19
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,157
You want to get stoned?

20
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,185
- This will wake you up.
<i>- What the fuck?</i>

21
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,929
This is good Amsterdam shit.

22
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,507
That's the shit right there, dude.

23
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,376
Trust me.

24
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,478
Yeah.

25
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,619
- It's all good, bro.
- Yeah, dude, smoke it!

26
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44,189
- Dude, what happened?
- Any Dutch people in Amsterdam?

27
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,999
All right, this is my friend, Josh.

28
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,439
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

29
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,477
- Do you guys want another round?
- Yes, okay.

30
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,116
Yeah?

31
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,218
We will be right back.

32
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,785
- What are you doing?
- What?

33
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:26,125
Do you see a single other person
in here with a fucking fanny pack?

34
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,323
Wait. There's a guy.

35
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,832
Why don't you go have
fanny-pack sex with him..

36
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,563
and jizz all over each other's
storage compartments?

37
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,731
I can't put my passport in my pocket.
It chafes my thighs, bitch.

38
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,638
- All right?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:38,971
Where's Oli?

40
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,081
He's fucking genius.

41
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,684
<i>Sneepur</i> alert, 3 o'clock.

42
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,089
- She smokes.
- Dude, it's Europe!

43
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,627
Every fucking chick smokes.
Stop being a pussy.

44
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,766
You are so easy sometimes.

45
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,332
The power of the pack is yours.
I'm out of here.

46
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,402
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,811
Yeah, I..
No, I don't even speak Dutch.

48
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,076
No, I'm sorry, I..

49
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,982
Get off me, you fucking
faggot-ass elf. Fuck off.

50
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,747
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Hey. Hey.

51
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,686
Come on, faggot.

52
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,689
- Fucker!
- Get your fucking hands off me.

53
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,390
- I'm an American, I got rights.
- Get the fuck out.

54
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,866
- Your fucking club sucks ass, bro.
- Kiss my American ass, fucker.

55
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,868
- Fuck you.
- Let's get out of here, bro.

56
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,007
Hey, I don't know why
you guys are waiting.

57
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,338
It's a fucking fag fest in there.
Wall-to-wall fucking cock.

58
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,912
You need one of these
to get in, bro. Sorry.

59
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,571
That shit was classic, dude.

60
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,741
He was gonna throw down
with a 400-pound Dutchman.

61
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,285
I'm fucking awesome!

62
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,283
I don't fucking know what..

63
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,290
I thought you were a Jew, man.
This guy's a fucking Israeli!

64
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,018
You are fucking Israeli.

65
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,929
Oh, God, I hope bestiality
is legal in Amsterdam..

66
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,125
because that girl's a fucking hog.
Look at that, man.

67
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,629
Hey, guys,
I think she likes me, man.

68
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:15,104
Oh, look at that.
Josh, my gift to you, man.

69
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:19,075
Thanks, but paying to do whatever
you want to someone isn't a turn-on.

70
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,612
How are you gonna get over your chick
if you don't bang some new pussy?

71
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,046
You can't go home
without getting some hot chick.

72
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,243
I agree, but I shouldn't
have to pay for it.

73
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,479
Hey, come on, I'm paying, man.

74
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,906
Hey.

75
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,379
Are you okay?

76
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,351
Hello? Hello?

77
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:11,521
Hey, close the door.
You watch, you pay.

78
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,393
Sorry. Jesus.

79
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,730
You're up, slugger.

80
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,199
Man, I'm fucking.. I'm tired, man.
I can, like, barely stand up.

81
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,364
Josh, you want
to be a fucking writer?

82
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,306
How about some life experience,
right there in that room.

83
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,446
- What do we have in here?
- Hey, you watch, you pay.

84
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,051
I pay. I pay, man. Come on.

85
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,650
Hey.

86
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,957
Come, sit.

87
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,199
Your friends are so funny.

88
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,737
Yeah.

89
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:59,270
You can wash over here, by sink.

90
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,751
It was fine.

91
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,157
What do you mean? That bitch had
the best fucking tits in Amsterdam.

92
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,562
It was fine. It was whatever.

93
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,001
What was that?

94
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,143
- It's fucking after curfew, man.
- Curfew? What are we, 13?

95
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,872
Let us the fuck in,
we're freezing our balls off.

96
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,642
We paid to stay here.
They can't just, like, lock us out.

97
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,079
This is bullshit.

98
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,480
Hello?

99
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,245
Open the fucking door.

100
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,252
- What did you tell him?
- He just told them to let us in.

101
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,192
- Shut up!
- Jesus.

102
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,132
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking Americans.

103
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,135
Hey, I know what to do.

104
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,710
Shut up.

105
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,606
Hey, hey, guys. Up here.
Climb quickly.

106
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,878
Come on.

107
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,209
Go. Go, go, go.

108
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,383
Oh, don't mind them.

109
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,420
They are so fucked up they don't
know what planet they are on.

110
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,295
- Thanks, bro.
- It's no problem.

111
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,463
Not everyone
want to kill Americans.

112
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,067
Paxton.

113
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,443
Alexei. But call me Alex.

114
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:47,211
What's up, Alex.
This is Josh and Oli.

115
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,417
Guys, this is fucking awesome, man.

116
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,149
I'm the first in line for <i>sneepur.</i>

117
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,220
Oh, that's Icelandic for "clit."

118
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,531
Clitoris or clitoris,
however you wanna say that.

119
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,758
Women have it.

120
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,961
It's, like, right near the labia.
Like, it hangs.

121
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,336
Oh, yeah.
Very good <i>sneepur</i> in Iceland.

122
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,909
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys, have a seat.

123
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,185
Where you travel to?

124
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,517
We started in Paris,
which is where we met this drifter.

125
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,283
Anyway, we went all over France..

126
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,394
and then Switzerland, Belgium,
and now we're in Amsterdam.

127
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,053
Yeah, kind of over Amsterdam.
Way too many Americans.

128
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,257
Yeah, but Oli's got a friend
with a flat in Barcelona..

129
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,632
and he's supposed to hook us up
with some hot-ass <i>señoritas.</i>

130
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,765
Looking for girls?

131
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,103
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

132
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,710
So talk to Alex.

133
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,776
He open up the pussy
all over the Europe.

134
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,111
I can help you.

135
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,020
Oh, shit.
Alex is a pimp, apparently.

136
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,315
Thanks, bro,
but I think we'll be okay.

137
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,960
- Yeah.
- Good.

138
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,729
You looking for girls like this?

139
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,980
These are fucking magnificent.

140
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:26,017
- Who the hell are these girls?
- You have to go east, my friend.

141
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,244
This is where the best girls are.

142
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,752
The best.

143
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,753
How far east?

144
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,859
You can go as far as Ukraine,
around Odessa.

145
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,990
These girls I met
at this one hostel in Slovakia..

146
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,757
just outside Bratislava.

147
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,360
The girls there are so hot
you cannot believe it.

148
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,172
And they love anyone foreign,
especially American.

149
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,940
They hear your accent,
they fuck you.

150
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,273
So wait, this place
is near Bratislava?

151
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,539
Josh.

152
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,513
You won't find this hostel
in any guidebook.

153
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,847
Barcelona, so many Americans.

154
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,149
But Slovakia? No one there.

155
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:09,226
There is so much pussy, and because
of the war, there are no guys.

156
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,688
You go to this hostel,
you will have any girl you want.

157
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,459
They go crazy for any foreigner.

158
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,398
You just..

159
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,534
take them.

160
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,331
Fuck, man.

161
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,369
Can't you keep your Viking ass
in your pants for, like, two seconds?

162
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,339
Hey, man, I shaved my ass
just for you.

163
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,570
- Okay, all right.
- My Viking balls too.

164
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,179
Okay, stop.

165
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,650
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,352
My daughter.

167
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,521
She miss her daddy,
and Daddy miss her.

168
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,291
Yeah, no problem, dude, it's cool.

169
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,164
- Saskia.
- Cute.

170
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,302
- She's adorable.
- She's a little cutie, yeah.

171
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,547
This is Svanhildur, my daughter.

172
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,273
- Very pretty.
- She's 6.

173
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,475
She's starting school this year.

174
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,086
Wait, you have a daughter?

175
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,088
Yeah, of course, my horse.
I was married for eight years.

176
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,857
Okay. All right.

177
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,792
- You are on vacation?
- Yeah, we're backpacking.

178
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,431
Our next stop is Bratislava.

179
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,069
- What?
- Slovakia.

180
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,875
You will like it.

181
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,474
Casino, girls.

182
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,673
You can pay to do anything.

183
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,613
Anything.

184
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,645
- How are the girls?
- Very beautiful.

185
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,157
They will love you.
Handsome American like you.

186
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,820
Handsome devil. He is handsome.

187
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,862
That's.. That's awkward.
That's awkward.

188
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,404
That's awkward too.

189
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,241
- You need a fork there, chief?
- No, no, no.

190
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,943
I prefer to use my hands.

191
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,516
I believe..

192
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,657
people have
lost their relationship with food.

193
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,393
They do not think:

194
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,226
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

195
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:05,301
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

196
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,870
I appreciate it more.

197
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,507
Well, I'm vegetarian.

198
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,143
And I am a meat-eater.

199
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,245
It's human nature.

200
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,376
Well, I'm human,
and it's not in my nature.

201
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,081
Tell me, what is your nature?

202
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,355
Don't touch!
Don't fucking touch me!

203
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,416
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,293
Excuse me.

205
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,363
Fucking freak.

206
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,258
Jesus.

207
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,904
Edward Saladhands
just groped Josh.

208
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,807
Dude, you finally hooked up.
That's awesome.

209
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,410
Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.

210
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,274
Or we could visit some factories.

211
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,081
Should be cool.

212
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,081
In this area..

213
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:04,780
we make plastic for Slovakia.

214
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,087
Is that so?

215
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,245
Look at this.

216
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,227
- Nice, eh?
- This is a fucking hostel?

217
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,630
Holy shit.

218
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,676
You can have that, man.
I'm too scared.

219
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,679
Hey, hey. The party has arrived.

220
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,578
- You are saved from boredom.
- Let me guess.

221
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:45,190
You must be
the King of the Swing.

222
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,587
You made a reservation under
"King of the Swing?"

223
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,523
- Yeah, of course, my horse.
- I'm sorry.

224
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,563
- He doesn't get out of his cage much.
- I can see that.

225
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,032
Here are your keys.

226
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,137
You leave your passports
at the desk.

227
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,070
That was taken when I was like 13.
I was kind of husky.

228
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,612
Not anymore, though, you know?

229
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,751
Do you have any private rooms?
We're probably gonna need them.

230
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:17,082
The rooms are semiprivate,
so you will have roommates.

231
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,157
Roommates, huh? That's gay.

232
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,566
Sorry.

233
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,130
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

234
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,240
The room is yours.
We are going to the spa.

235
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,575
You should come.

236
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,179
Spa.

237
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,965
Jugs.

238
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,005
- Hey.
- Hello.

239
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,165
Oh, Jesus.

240
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,271
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

241
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,284
How you doing?

242
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,120
I'm so happy I shaved my balls.

243
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,390
What? I have the smoothest balls
in Iceland.

244
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,623
- You wanna see?
- No, no, no, you're not.. I'm good.

245
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,064
Put your anteater away,
it's totally creepy.

246
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,471
- You're not from Iceland, no?
- No. Fuck, no. American.

247
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,336
Yeah, unlike him,
I had my foreskin removed at birth.

248
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,140
Hygiene and.. Am I talking?

249
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,071
- I'm Josh.
- Natalya.

250
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,509
- And this is Svetlana.
- Hi.

251
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,847
Hi, I'm Paxton.

252
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,016
- And this is Oli.
- The King of the Swing.

253
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,788
Hello.

254
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,288
Face on the ass. Never gets old.

255
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,930
Jesus.

256
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,032
So where are you girls from?

257
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,464
I'm from Italy,
but my parents are Russian.

258
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,698
Prague.

259
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,664
Prague's cool. Kafka.

260
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:20,304
So, Natalya..

261
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,107
- Yeah?
- You're Russian, eh?

262
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,299
Oh, my God.
Look, there are too many girls.

263
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,305
- This is awesome.
- Yes.

264
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,989
I mean, I was a senior,
you know, she was a junior..

265
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,557
and then I graduated,
and it was weird, you know.

266
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:45,095
I mean, I'm totally over it.
It's.. You know, it's cool.

267
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,697
It's okay.

268
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,389
Look, Vala is here.

269
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,059
- Who?
- Vala, from front desk. Vala.

270
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,136
- All right, Oli.
- Hey, I told you, man.

271
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,401
I'm the King of the Swing.

272
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,913
Come, let's dance.

273
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,655
- Does the cigarette bother you?
- No, it's..

274
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,588
I put away.

275
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,024
It's fine, I..

276
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:20,097
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

277
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,266
But I'll be back, okay?

278
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:46,785
Cigarette.

279
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,360
Cigarette.

280
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,089
Aren't you a little young?

281
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,060
- Dollar.
- What?

282
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:54,961
Dollar.

283
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,567
- Dollar.
- Here you go.

284
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,316
Here, children commit
the most crime.

285
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,879
They don't care.
They will attack anyone.

286
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,083
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

287
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,552
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

288
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,262
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

289
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,799
Hey, Josh.

290
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,434
Faggot.

291
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,237
Go with your friends. It's okay.

292
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,236
I wanted to say sorry about earlier.

293
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,432
About the way I reacted.

294
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,604
We cool?

295
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,647
I would have done
the same thing at your age.

296
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,914
It's not easy..

297
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,754
but from my experience..

298
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:58,260
choosing to have a family
was the right choice for me.

299
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,963
Now I have my little girl..

300
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:05,900
who means more to me
than anything in the world.

301
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,730
But you should do..

302
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,274
whatever's right for you.

303
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,506
Excuse me, it's my turn now.

304
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,096
Should we be doing this
with them there?

305
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,064
Yeah, it's okay.

306
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:42,801
- Yeah, baby. Josh, give it to me, baby.
- Okay, all right. Okay, stop!

307
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,443
- All right.
- Come on, big boy.

308
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:48,011
- We go to spa.
- Spa.

309
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,842
Spa, spa, spa.
Being dirty while getting clean.

310
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,574
Bye.

311
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,066
Mission accomplished.

312
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:27,176
You know that Amsterdam kid
with the thing on his lip?

313
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,075
I'm gonna send him
a really nice thank-you note.

314
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,374
Be quiet.

315
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,485
They're showering together.

316
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,758
Shit, man. We're never leaving here.

317
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,529
I guess Oli's not back yet.

318
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,463
No, dude, he probably
took that desk girl home.

319
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,159
We'll see him at breakfast.

320
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:10,182
- What's the name?
- Oli Ericson, 237.

321
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,719
How are we supposed to
understand this without subtitles?

322
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,020
Fucking gay.

323
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,220
Yeah, he checked out this morning.

324
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,798
You mean he took his
passport to go out?

325
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,333
No, it say he checked out
this morning.

326
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,500
- When this morning?
- I don't know exact time.

327
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,833
I could find out tomorrow.

328
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:39,049
Hey, Oli, it's Pax.
Are you still with that chick?

329
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,151
Can I leave a note
in case he comes back?

330
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,344
Okay, cool. Yeah.

331
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,149
All right.

332
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,695
He's probably still with Vala.
When she call me, I call you, okay?

333
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,664
Okay.

334
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,394
- We see you later, right?
- Yeah.

335
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,663
Okay.

336
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,969
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

337
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:08,806
Oli, hey, it's me again.
We're gonna go into town, so call us.

338
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,641
You're gay.
Damn voice mail again.

339
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:14,013
- Hi! Hi! Hi!
- Hi.

340
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,881
Your friend.

341
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,215
- What the hell?
- Your friend, my friend.

342
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,257
What does that say?

343
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,956
<i>Sayonara.</i> Your friend.

344
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,757
What, they left? Like, together?

345
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,833
That doesn't make any sense.
Oli doesn't even like Asian girls.

346
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,593
I mean, no offense, but..

347
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,294
When did she send this to you?

348
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:35,598
This picture. Today?

349
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:39,076
Could you do me a favor
and send this picture to my phone?

350
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,233
This picture.

351
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,979
That water looks fucking cold.

352
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,674
You know, if you fell in,
you'd die in 90 seconds.

353
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,286
Dude, did I tell you I saw
a girl drown when I was 8?

354
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,253
- Where?
- Lake Michigan.

355
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:57,361
It was fucked up, man.
This little girl, probably 4 or 5.

356
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,187
We made eye contact,
which was a weird thing, you know..

357
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,960
and she was yelling for me
to help her.

358
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,500
Yeah? What did you do?

359
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,504
I ran to the lifeguard, who was busy
talking to her boyfriend at the time..

360
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,234
and I yelled, you know,
"There's this girl drowning."

361
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,277
And she couldn't see her.
Probably thought I was making it up.

362
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:19,474
And then a second later all you could
hear was this horrible screaming.

363
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,249
It was that little girl's mother, dude.

364
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,353
Her kid was dead.

365
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,587
- Jesus.
- I had nightmares for years after that.

366
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,490
I mean, I'd wake up every fucking
night hearing that mother scream.

367
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,255
I just..

368
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,228
I just felt like I could have
done more.

369
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,994
You did the right thing.
Could've been a double drowning.

370
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,399
Yeah, well, I didn't see it
that way at the time.

371
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,201
All I knew was this little girl was dead
and her mother's life was ruined.

372
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,537
What makes you think of this now?

373
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:51,773
Bubble gum.

374
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,714
- Sorry, kid.
- No, no. Give him some.

375
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,222
What are you doing?

376
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,887
These fucking kids are dangerous.

377
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:07,131
Hey, Oli.

378
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,494
- Hey, Oli.
- Hey.

379
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,037
- Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,504
- Hey, Oli. Hey!
- Oli!

381
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,311
It's your lucky day, Josh.

382
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,109
A museum.

383
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,227
How's it hanging?

384
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,131
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

385
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,271
- He got you.
- Yeah, that's hilarious.

386
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,666
Okay.

387
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,932
Hey, Oli.

388
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,338
Hey, Oli.

389
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,809
Hey, hey.

390
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,012
Excuse me?

391
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,945
I'm sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

392
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,749
Well, I'm not.

393
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,515
Where did you get that jacket?

394
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:46,454
- Hey, I'm talking to you, man.
- Get your fucking hands off me.

395
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,759
This is my jacket.

396
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,512
It's from Oli.

397
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,977
"I go home"?

398
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,308
I don't know,
maybe his battery died.

399
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,952
Hey, Kana, when are you leaving?

400
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,554
I'm sorry. When are you going away?

401
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,286
Tomorrow, I go.

402
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,826
Okay, because we may go too.

403
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:28,796
Do you wanna go to the train with us?
To the train station?

404
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,503
Tomorrow, train?

405
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,331
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,975
- Hello, Josh.
- Hey.

407
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,078
- Hey.
- Come, we go for disco?

408
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,943
Actually, I just wanna find my friend
and get the fuck out of here.

409
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,082
Okay, we'll see you.

410
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,557
Hey, guys, hold up a sec.
We'll be right out.

411
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,358
Okay.

412
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,326
- Josh, come here, dude.
- Yeah, what?

413
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:10,069
It's not their fault Oli disappeared,
so stop acting like it is.

414
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,368
- I'm annoyed he'd ditch us.
- I'm pissed too.

415
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,034
But we're not in America.

416
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,147
I mean, people meet each other
and split without saying shit.

417
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,242
It's just how they do it over here.

418
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,318
As well as we may think we know Oli,
we don't really know him.

419
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,387
He could've gone
somewhere with that girl.

420
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,582
Fuck, maybe he's in Iceland.
The guy's got a daughter.

421
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,090
So let's look at our options.

422
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,525
We can A, fuck these girls one more
night and then head to Barcelona..

423
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:36,030
or B, not fuck them,
then head to Barcelona anyway.

424
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:40,001
Think about it. When I'm studying for
the bar and you're writing your thesis..

425
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,264
this is the shit
we're gonna think about.

426
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,500
Okay. All right, he doesn't show up,
it's his problem.

427
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:48,009
- It's his problem.
- All right.

428
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,306
All right.

429
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,780
Hey, Kana, you wanna go
to the disco with us?

430
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,709
You know, disco?
Dancing?

431
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,221
No?

432
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,256
Josh?

433
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,196
- I'm gonna go back.
- Are you okay?

434
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,700
I'm, like.. I'm tired.

435
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,430
Actually, I have, like, a headache.

436
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,367
If you want, I will go with you.

437
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:56,037
No, no, no, I'll just see you
back at the room.

438
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,209
Goodbye.

439
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,348
<i>Fucking pussy.</i>

440
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,380
- Josh.
- Vala.

441
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,389
You don't look well.

442
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,790
- No, I..
- Here, let me help you.

443
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:48,022
I feel sick.

444
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:01,410
Where is?
Where is Oli?

445
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,604
You need rest.

446
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,302
Where's the restroom?

447
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,379
Past the bar, in the back.

448
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,446
You guys cool?

449
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,555
- Vodka Red Bull.
- Vodka Red Bull, <i>danke.</i>

450
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,897
Yeah.

451
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,669
Hey!

452
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,573
Hey!

453
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,498
Open the door.

454
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,121
Oh, fuck.

455
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,253
What the f..?

456
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,315
Oh, fuck.

457
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,327
What? Who are you?

458
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,496
What the f..? Where the fuck am I?

459
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,139
What the fuck is this shit?

460
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,203
Please, please..
Fuck. Please, please, please..

461
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,607
I didn't fucking do shit to you,
what the fuck!

462
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,614
Please, please, what the..?

463
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:29,219
Please, no, sir.
Please fucking stop. Please!

464
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:30,547
What the fuck?

465
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,385
Please, I didn't fucking do anything.

466
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,050
What the fuck?

467
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:40,254
What the fuck?
This is such fucking bullshit.

468
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,921
What the fuck is this?

469
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,930
What? No! No, please don't..!

470
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,228
What the..?
No, no, fucking don't you.. No, no!

471
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,072
Oh, my God, no, no!
Oh, my fucking God!

472
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,208
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!

473
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,639
Oh, please. What the fuck?

474
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,211
No, no, no, no, fuck! No!

475
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:08,153
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

476
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:41,953
You.

477
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:49,228
Why?

478
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,271
I always wanted to be a surgeon..

479
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,672
but the boards wouldn't pass me.

480
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,142
Can you guess why?

481
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,380
You see?

482
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:18,257
So I went into business..

483
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,091
but business is so boring.

484
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:25,859
You buy things, you sell them.
You make money, you spend money.

485
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,766
What kind of life is that?

486
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,736
A surgeon..

487
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,639
he holds the very essence
of life in his hands.

488
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,537
Your life.

489
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,182
He touches it.

490
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:43,176
He has a relationship with it.

491
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,045
He's part of it.

492
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:51,457
Please, please.
Just let me go, please.

493
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,189
You want to go?

494
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,190
Is that what you want?

495
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,687
Oh, my God!

496
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,196
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

497
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:39,933
You are free to go.

498
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,194
Oh, fuck. No!

499
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,432
No. No, fuck. No, fuck..

500
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:15,138
Please, I have money.
I'll fucking pay you.

501
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,177
Ten times, two times,
whatever you want..

502
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:18,747
- Pay me?
- Yes.

503
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,406
No one is paying me.

504
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:24,145
In fact, I am the one paying them.

505
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,565
Relax. Relax, bro.

506
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:39,469
Oh, shit.

507
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,749
- Two thirty-seven, please.
- Two three seven.

508
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,583
Didn't you check out?

509
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,153
No, not yet.

510
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,050
Not yet.

511
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:07,925
- This your bag?
- Yeah.

512
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,692
The maid brought it here.
You're checked out.

513
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,593
- I didn't check out.
- It says.

514
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,431
It happened this morning.

515
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,732
This is bullshit.
Did somebody leave a note?

516
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,966
Because I didn't
fucking check out, dude.

517
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,707
No, man, just this bag.
If it's a mistake..

518
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,440
Yeah, it's definitely a mistake.
We need a fucking room.

519
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,983
Chill out, man. You're on vacation.

520
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,181
Two three seven.

521
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,984
Hey, was there a Japanese girl
waiting in the lobby for somebody?

522
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:42,257
No, think they left this morning.

523
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:43,923
Yeah.

524
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,500
I'm sorry, dude.

525
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:58,647
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

526
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,718
It's okay. We are going to the spa.

527
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,878
You will join us?

528
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,661
You should come.

529
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,327
Hey, Josh, call me
soon as you get this, man.

530
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,734
I got locked in that club.
It was retarded, dude.

531
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:24,534
I'm at the hostel.

532
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,068
Svetlana!

533
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,882
Svetlana!

534
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,808
Hey!

535
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:12,149
You little fucker.

536
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,705
Jesus.

537
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,603
Wait at hostel for your friends.

538
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,267
They will look for you there
no matter what.

539
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:39,712
Yeah, I know. But, see, my friend
Josh is the kind of guy who..

540
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:43,683
He just wouldn't check out without
so much as leaving a note, you know.

541
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:46,455
He's the responsible one.

542
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,615
Yeah, but maybe he worried
his belongings get stolen..

543
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,818
so he take them when he go out.

544
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,521
Someone misplace if he leaves note.

545
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,598
It is not uncommon.

546
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:01,928
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that I can do?

547
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,901
There's nothing right now.

548
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,538
We have his picture..

549
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:10,942
if we see him, or he is picked up,
or something happen..

550
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,879
we contact you at hostel, yeah?

551
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,518
Okay.

552
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:18,988
Where are you from?

553
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,152
California.

554
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,755
You are so far from home.

555
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,271
Paxton. Come, have a drink.

556
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,183
Hello, Mr. American.

557
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,824
- Did you get my messages?
- Which one?

558
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,522
There are so many.

559
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:07,391
I call you back, but child answer.

560
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,331
Yeah, I know.

561
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,058
Have you seen Josh?

562
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,734
In English, please.

563
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:20,605
He is with your friend..

564
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,642
the King of the Swing.

565
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,239
- He's with Oli.
- Why you leave last night?

566
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:30,685
Did you not listen to my messages?
I got locked in a storage room.

567
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:34,187
I don't know,
I got sick and passed out.

568
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,496
- What?
- She said you met another girl.

569
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,529
Where are my friends?

570
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,564
The art show.

571
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,335
- You mean like a museum?
- No, no, no.

572
00:51:55,179 --> 00:52:00,811
Not museum.
They went.. How you say, for artist?

573
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:04,010
- Exhibit.
- Exhibit for artist.

574
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:05,678
No, that doesn't make any sense.

575
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,517
Why? What is wrong?

576
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,785
Well, they didn't leave a note.
They didn't call or do anything.

577
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,426
They tell us to tell you.

578
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,564
Yeah, but I tried calling them all day.

579
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,825
Yes, but their phone, the battery die
and they do not have..

580
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,026
How you say, for electricity?

581
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:23,173
Converter. Okay, whatever,
where is this art show..

582
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,967
because I wanna go.

583
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,973
- Have a drink.
- I don't want a drink.

584
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,305
All right? I wanna see some art.

585
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,141
Okay? So can we go?

586
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,157
You're not going?

587
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,955
I've seen this show.

588
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,363
You want gum?

589
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,440
No.

590
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,190
Too bad for you.

591
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,900
We are here.

592
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,827
Are you coming or what?

593
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:36,839
Excuse me. Excuse me.

594
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,505
How is it in there?

595
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,502
Be careful.

596
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,644
Why is that?

597
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:49,580
You could spend all your money..

598
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,647
in there.

599
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,151
How much is it?

600
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,419
For you, free.

601
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,235
There.

602
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,378
That's the show?

603
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:56,176
Yes.

604
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:14,296
- What?
- Nothing.

605
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:19,340
You're so serious,
Mr. Serious American.

606
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,165
You fucking whore.

607
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,337
You fucking bitch.

608
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:30,640
You fucking bitch!

609
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:34,917
I get a lot of money for you..

610
00:57:35,085 --> 00:57:38,145
and that make you my bitch.

611
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:44,021
Fuck. Get the fuck off me!

612
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:47,689
This is fucked!

613
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,092
Get the fuck off me!

614
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,824
Get the fuck off me!

615
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,127
Fuck.

616
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:22,952
Talk.

617
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,920
Talk. Speak.

618
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,063
What the fuck
do you want me to say?

619
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:34,698
American.

620
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,572
No. No, wait!

621
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,108
I'm not fucking American!

622
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:45,175
I'm not fucking.. Look at me.
I'm not fucking American.

623
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:47,608
American.

624
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:53,155
Please, what the fuck is this?

625
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:01,831
Let me go. Please.

626
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:05,701
I promise I won't tell anybody.

627
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:09,396
Just please let me go.

628
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,656
Don't. Don't.

629
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,529
Please don't.

630
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,771
Don't, please.

631
01:00:54,718 --> 01:00:56,310
God.

632
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,509
Oh, please, stop!

633
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,485
Please stop it. Please stop it.

634
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,253
I know you don't wanna do this.

635
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,894
Please don't do this.

636
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,351
Fuck.

637
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,731
Oh, shit.

638
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,600
What the fuck?

639
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,035
What do you think?

640
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:31,497
How do I look?

641
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:34,734
I feel like a butcher or a surgeon
or some shit, know what I mean?

642
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:38,744
I feel fucking ridiculous in this thing,
but I guess you need it, huh?

643
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:44,375
Yeah. I'll tell you something..

644
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:48,512
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Wait a sec.

645
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,622
How was it?

646
01:13:56,065 --> 01:13:57,464
Good.

647
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,966
Well, goddamn, motherfucker,
for this money, it better be. Shit.

648
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,434
What did you go for, a local?

649
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:04,834
What, European?

650
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,438
- American.
- An Amer..?

651
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:12,147
Ain't that a bitch. Big spender.
I fucking.. I love it.

652
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:15,147
I just fucking love that shit.
You know what they got for me?

653
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:17,342
They told me they lined up
something special.

654
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,613
I've been waiting almost a week
for this shit.

655
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,551
For 50 grand,
she better be worth it.

656
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:23,954
But it's supposed to be
a real rush, right?

657
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:28,790
It's like.. They told me
it's like a real fucking rush, right?

658
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:30,488
Come here.

659
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:34,300
I've been all over the world.
You know, I've been everywhere.

660
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,303
And the bottom line is,
pussy's pussy.

661
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:41,572
You know, every strip club,
every whorehouse, every..

662
01:14:41,744 --> 01:14:43,405
It's all the same shit.

663
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:47,606
I just fucked a girl two days ago, I don't
even remember the color of her tits.

664
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:53,513
But this, this is something
you never forget, right?

665
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:56,280
Right?

666
01:14:58,127 --> 01:14:59,924
- Never.
- Never, right.

667
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:03,591
Let me show you something.
Pretty sweet. Check this out.

668
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:06,735
What do you think of this?
Come on, let me see yours.

669
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:10,938
Come on, let me see yours.
We're all in the same club.

670
01:15:11,774 --> 01:15:13,264
I'll be out in a second, guy.

671
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,644
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you mind?

672
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,242
How'd you do it?

673
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,114
Did you do it real slow..

674
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:26,347
or did you just get it over with
right away?

675
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,285
That's why I asked for
the fucking gun.

676
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,550
Because I just wanted
to fucking do it quick.

677
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:32,318
I just wanted to get it over with.

678
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:35,088
But now I'm thinking maybe
I wanna feel it, you know?

679
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,891
I wanna fucking feel that shit.

680
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:40,399
So I don't know what to.. I'm thinking..
What do you think I should do?

681
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,536
- Make it quick.
- Make it quick.

682
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,676
Yes.

683
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:50,278
Yeah, that's.. No, fuck that shit.

684
01:15:50,446 --> 01:15:53,711
Fuck this, too fucking American, dude.
I'm going fucking old school.

685
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,577
Who wants this, motherfucker?

686
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:58,447
Who wants this shit?
Come on, motherfucker.

687
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:00,316
Bring it.

688
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:29,942
Hey, buddy.

689
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:32,808
Get your own fucking room.
I paid for this.

690
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:37,015
What are you, fucking deaf?

691
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:47,191
Kana.

692
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,863
- Oh, my God.
- What do you want me to do, Kana?

693
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:05,072
What? I don't understand
what you're saying. What?

694
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:17,453
Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hold still. Hold still.

695
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:21,926
- Fuck. Oh, God. God.
- No. No!

696
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:24,098
- Shit.
- No!

697
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:27,633
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

698
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,384
Fuck!

699
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,988
Fuck!

700
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,489
Fuck!

701
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:12,136
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, Kana.

702
01:20:36,198 --> 01:20:38,758
Move this fucking truck!

703
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:43,051
Fuck.

704
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,294
We're almost there.

705
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:03,939
Oh, my God.

706
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:08,611
Oh, no.

707
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:14,383
Fuck.

708
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:49,172
Kana.

709
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:52,482
Kana.

710
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:04,031
Come here.

711
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,941
No. No, Kana. Kana.

712
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:21,806
No, Kana.

713
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:21,068
No, thank you.
I prefer to use my hands.

714
01:26:21,443 --> 01:26:24,901
I believe people have lost
their relationship with food.

715
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,104
They do not think:

716
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:29,546
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

717
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:34,314
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

718
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:21,595
Oh, Jesus.

719
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,565
Goddamn!

720
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:36,677
Fucker.

721
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:08,774
No, please!

722
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:05,100
