1
00:02:54,722 --> 00:03:00,411
Once, in a time before time,
God breathed life into the universe.

2
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:06,897
And the light gave birth to Angels.
And the earth gave birth to man.

3
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:15,840
And fire gave birth to the Djinn. Creatures
condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds.

4
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,578
One who wakes a Djinn shall be given three wishes.

5
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:29,036
Upon the granting of the third, the unholy legions
of the Djinn shall be freed upon the earth.

6
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:39,430
Fear one thing only in all that is...
Fear the Djinn.

7
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,967
Make your second wish.

8
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:46,108
Astonish Me, Djinn.
Show me wonders.

9
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:49,079
As you wish.

10
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,738
Help me, sorcerer.
Help me!

11
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:36,416
Free us wizard.
Remove this curse.

12
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,693
Help us.

13
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:50,455
Behold. By all the names of God,
This is not what I wanted!

14
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,288
Then wish it away exalted one.
Wish it away.

15
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:56,674
Stop!

16
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:57,941
No more wishes.

17
00:05:58,204 --> 00:05:59,983
I beg your majesty. Silence.

18
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:02,257
But my poor people.
I must...

19
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:05,038
Do you wish their fate on the entire world?

20
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:07,664
No more wishes. Please.

21
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:11,939
I warned you, wizard.
Hold your tongue.

22
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,706
I'm the wish, is all this creature needs.

23
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:17,948
Three wishes granted
to the one who woke him

24
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:20,718
lets him open the gateway between worlds.

25
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:23,209
New wonders, majesty.

26
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,940
New splendors.

27
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,664
And new and terrible masters.

28
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:31,022
Yes...

29
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:41,313
(America, present day)

30
00:07:57,357 --> 00:08:00,045
I'm surprised you're here in person Mr. Beaumont.

31
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,754
Paperwork is completely in order.

32
00:08:01,754 --> 00:08:05,134
I waited it ten years, for this piece.

33
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:09,788
Antiquarian sculpture.
Eight foot tall.

34
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:15,521
A statue of the pre-Islamic God,
Ahura Mazda.

35
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:19,081
Under Islam, these gods were outlawed.

36
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:23,193
It's a miracle this was ever made.

37
00:08:34,492 --> 00:08:35,987
Jesus Christ!

38
00:08:35,987 --> 00:08:37,876
What the hell is he doing?

39
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:39,872
God dammit!

40
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:42,653
Does the word DUMB ASS
mean anything to you?

41
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:44,879
Watch that crate!
That's very expensive stuff!

42
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,857
Up yours...

43
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:47,410
...ahh shit!

44
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:02,504
Ughhhh. Ten years...

45
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:54,832
Hi. I can help you?

46
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:58,476
Maybe. I got a pawnshop down
the garment district,

47
00:09:58,476 --> 00:10:01,465
5th and Tooley. The armpit of the universe.

48
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:04,839
Anyway, this came in this morning.

49
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,636
I had a hunch about it. Gave the guy a good price,
and I'd like you to appraise it.

50
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,204
Well, I think you made a smart move.

51
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:14,525
- Nick?
- Shannon?

52
00:10:14,525 --> 00:10:17,954
I think we have something
Alex should take a look at.

53
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:20,423
Hello Betty!

54
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:24,505
Wow. This is ah... uh, this...

55
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:26,682
Which is its providence?

56
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:27,375
What?

57
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,301
History. Where did it come from?

58
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,057
Oh! I bought it from a guy
he said he got it from his grandmother.

59
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:33,868
That's all I know.

60
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:35,994
I've heard that one before.

61
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:39,367
I tell you what. I want to have my
best appraiser take a look at this.

62
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,431
Shannon here is going to
fill out a receipt for you.

63
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:45,231
And thank you for, uh... choosing Regal Auctioneering.

64
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:46,944
Sure.

65
00:10:58,472 --> 00:10:59,748
I guess that's it.

66
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:01,235
I guess it is.

67
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:02,702
Nice game.

68
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:09,621
How is um... Rick ?

69
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:14,122
I don't know. I haven't spoken to him.
It's over.

70
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:17,943
What's it been now? Six and a half weeks?

71
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:18,956
Seven.

72
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:21,710
Are you counting?

73
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:26,191
I thought. Maybe we, uh...

74
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:27,810
- What?

75
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,277
I thought maybe we could go out.

76
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:31,391
We go out all the time.

77
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:36,882
Yes, we go out all the time,
but we don't "Go Out".

78
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:37,784
There's a difference.

79
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:41,482
You are my best friend.
Do you know hard a friend is to find?

80
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:44,546
I dont wanna...
I do not want to mess that up.

81
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:45,868
Dates are a dime a dozen.

82
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:50,203
Aw come on now. It's so old.
It's a date.

83
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,298
Wait. You know what it is?
I'm just...

84
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:59,143
I'm just worried about losing
what little I've got left now.

85
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:00,721
Including you.

86
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,314
How about dinner and a movie?

87
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,976
How about hotdogs and a ball game?

88
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,085
Playing it safe, huh?

89
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:13,770
I am going out on a limb here.

90
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,365
I'm casting a spell on you here Alex.

91
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,253
Maybe it'll work.

92
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:30,926
Hey.

93
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,236
I'll see you later.

94
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,760
I'll be at the lab.

95
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,370
Hey Alex.
Think about what I said.

96
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:08,260
My god. A fire opal this size.

97
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,525
It's magnificent.

98
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:13,120
How magnificent?

99
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,563
Excellent translucence.

100
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,256
No other color traces.

101
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:23,901
It's unique.

102
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:27,322
Oh that's a good word.
Oh I love that word.

103
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:29,116
"Unique"

104
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:31,747
Should that show quite a price? Yeah?

105
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:33,433
Oh yes.

106
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:37,362
- I am salivating. Get me a report ASAP?
- Yes.

107
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:40,146
- Nick?
- Hmm?

108
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:40,960
Leave.

109
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,981
- Oh, ummm.
- Yes!

110
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:58,537
What's this?

111
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:22,417
You woke me.

112
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:35,133
You woke me.

113
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,394
What?

114
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,901
I didn't hear you come in,
you scared me. I...

115
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:04,391
What's the verdict?

116
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:10,575
I think...  ...there may
be something wrong with it.

117
00:15:12,032 --> 00:15:13,284
Does it affect the value?

118
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:15,668
I have to talk to a friend of mine.
We're gonna have to run some more tests.

119
00:15:15,668 --> 00:15:19,420
Tests?
Like what? A physical?

120
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:37,457
- There'something inside of it?
- Right.

121
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:42,249
I don't know. I'm no gemmologist.

122
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:46,677
I could run some spectral analysis,
infrared. Get some readings.

123
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,205
That'd be great. Can you do it now?

124
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:52,740
Oh hoh no. Hold on.
I got about two hours worth of

125
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,848
Professor Leiber's bullshit to take of first.
I'll get to it as soon as I can.

126
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,964
Come on. Do you want to stay?

127
00:15:58,964 --> 00:16:02,454
No, I can't. I have got to put my
girls through their basis.

128
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,884
Thanks. This is really important.
So call me later. Okay?

129
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,065
You're the best Josh.
I owe ya.

130
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:12,195
Yeah. Well, how about that dinner then?

131
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:21,243
Time-out.

132
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:23,997
You.
That was very good.

133
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:25,613
Very good. Do you know why you missed?

134
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:26,285
Huh-uh.

135
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,819
You didn't have stillness.

136
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:31,037
All of you can put the ball in the hoops
as long as you take your time.

137
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:33,245
take a breath.
Get your aim. Right?

138
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:35,092
But you don't always have that time in a game.

139
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:37,720
Somebody is always going to be trying
to take the ball away from you,

140
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,021
and that's when you need stillness.
Not in your body. Your mind.

141
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,375
When you get a chance to make a shot,

142
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:48,476
you've got to forget about everything else.
Time doesn't exist.

143
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:50,891
The other players do not exist.

144
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:52,913
It is you and the basket.

145
00:16:53,473 --> 00:16:56,743
You see it, you find it.

146
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,061
Shoot the ball.

147
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,616
Laser targeting for analysis

148
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:27,551
Wow. This is the easiest date you
have ever gotten Aickman.

149
00:17:35,686 --> 00:17:37,796
What is that?

150
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:46,527
You awoke me.

151
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:54,896
End laser scanning.

152
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,939
End the laser scan Dammit!

153
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:47,848
"Hi. Geophysics. We're probably
changing lead into gold right now."

154
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:49,894
So, leave a message.

155
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,497
Josh, it is Alex,
you are there?

156
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:55,755
- Josh, something
- Alex

157
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:59,768
really weird happened to me on the court,
and I really need to talk about it.

158
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,787
Is somebody there?

159
00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:10,694
- Yes.
- Oh my god.

160
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:33,088
- Is the pain terrible?
- Oh god.

161
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,893
I can help you with that.

162
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,186
I can ease your suffering.

163
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:45,294
All you have to do is ask.

164
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:50,079
Tell me you want the pain to cease

165
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:54,704
Yes.

166
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,831
As you wish.

167
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:44,037
Oh my god...

168
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:21,573
Josh!

169
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,272
Computer malfunction. It must
have been one hell of a computer.

170
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,016
- Josh.
- Hey!

171
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,636
- Josh. JOSH!
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey miss.

172
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,926
- Hey lady. Lady. Hey hey.
- Josh! Josh!

173
00:21:47,126 --> 00:21:48,375
Is he? Is he?

174
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,283
Get off of me!

175
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:53,685
I'm sorry.

176
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,461
I'm detective Nathan.

177
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:56,665
And you are?

178
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,760
Alex Amberson.

179
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,747
Alex Amberson.
Alright? Good.

180
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:08,855
I take it that you knew the...
um, Josh.

181
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,169
He was my best friend.

182
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,655
I'm sorry.

183
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,943
Look, uh.
You want to have a seat?

184
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:20,604
No. I want to know what happened.

185
00:22:22,002 --> 00:22:23,819
It looks like an accident.

186
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:25,997
An equipment malfaunction maybe.

187
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:30,380
You have any idea what he was working on?

188
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,332
He was analysing...

189
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:36,562
...a gem stone.

190
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:38,200
Opal.

191
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:40,855
For me.

192
00:22:48,912 --> 00:22:51,642
Excuse me lady. Uh.
Help out an old altar boy?

193
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:54,027
If you ain't got no change, a dollar will do it.

194
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:57,185
Hell, I'll even take five.
I'll wait until you get back.

195
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,159
Look. How many times do I gotta tell you?

196
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:12,038
Hey, you left customers in there.
That's not a good way to run a business.

197
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:13,545
Don't tell me how to run my business.

198
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:14,624
You're a fucking bum.

199
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:20,504
Well you don't tell me how to run my life.
You're a fucking prick.

200
00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:24,425
I'll talk to anybody I want to.
You don't own this fucking sidewalk.

201
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:27,302
You wanna know something?
I do own this fucking sidewalk.

202
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:30,208
You wanna know why?
Because I pay fucking taxes.

203
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,331
Fuck you.

204
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:33,345
No. Fuck you.

205
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,395
I hope you die, you sack of shit.

206
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:39,570
I hope you die, and I hope you
float down the gutter

207
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,412
so I can fuck'n piss on ya.

208
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:46,095
Bald headed baboon.

209
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:50,703
Piss complected afterbirth
to a Chinese gang banger.

210
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,847
Educated idiot!

211
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:56,479
"I own the sidewalk."
"I pay taxes"

212
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,228
I got your taxes swinging.

213
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,785
I tell you what to do with your taxes.

214
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:02,741
And I hope they poke a
hole into your kidneys

215
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,730
when they are heading up
towards your throat.

216
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:09,411
I hope you rot in hell.
And that goes for your...

217
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:13,279
Who is that?

218
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:17,276
A friend, perhaps.

219
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:20,809
Tell me...

220
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:26,194
Do you really mean those curses
you hurled so freely?

221
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:29,430
Damned right I did.

222
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,992
What would you do
to have them come true?

223
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:37,446
A cigarette and a handshake
is about all I got right now pal.

224
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:41,452
Not quite.
You have a soul.

225
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:44,968
That, I'd trade for a shower and a jug of Jack.

226
00:24:44,968 --> 00:24:49,028
Then the death of your enemy would consider a bargain.

227
00:24:49,028 --> 00:24:52,447
You really are fucked up.
You know that?

228
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:55,589
But I do like the way you think.

229
00:24:55,589 --> 00:25:00,206
Indulge me then.
What would you have happen?

230
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:02,560
Give it some thought.

231
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:06,312
Enjoy it.

232
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:10,855
He should only get cancer.

233
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:18,388
Should only get cancer and die.

234
00:25:18,388 --> 00:25:20,992
As you wish.

235
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:23,595
Welfare checks. Food stamps.

236
00:25:23,595 --> 00:25:26,220
And another thing I...

237
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:29,225
Hey buddy, you Okay?

238
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,562
- You okay?
- I do not know.

239
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:41,993
Let her. Let her...
Let her go.

240
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:04,148
Was it worth it?

241
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:17,404
Run, insect.

242
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:20,887
Run and tell those you will,
what you will.

243
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:24,509
Tell them there is something
loose in their city.

244
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:29,606
Something which feeds on wishes,

245
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:37,275
but tell them quickly.

246
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:40,467
while you still have a soul.

247
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:05,012
Hey.
You're not enjoying it.

248
00:27:05,012 --> 00:27:07,181
Put it out.

249
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,810
I am really sorry about Josh.

250
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,223
I know how close you guys were.

251
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:25,209
No, we were'nt as close as he wanted,
and now it's just to...

252
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:28,313
Alex. Listen to me.

253
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,500
What happened to Josh
is not your fault.

254
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:34,417
I think it is.

255
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:35,962
What?

256
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:45,726
There was something...
...weird, in the opal.

257
00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:48,577
I think that was what exploded.

258
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:53,241
I think what I gave Josh is what killed him.

259
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:56,122
Do you have any idea how
crazy that sounds?

260
00:27:57,041 --> 00:28:02,638
Yes. I know exactly how crazy it sounds.
That's the problem.

261
00:28:07,283 --> 00:28:12,708
Do you, um...
Do you want me to call Dr. Montiglio again?

262
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,663
No.

263
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:18,279
I'm fine.

264
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,897
I'm just upset.

265
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:23,496
You're not just upset.

266
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:26,447
You're imagining things,
just like the last time.

267
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:29,044
This is nothing like the last time Shannon.

268
00:28:30,314 --> 00:28:31,510
Why don't you go to bed?

269
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,268
I don't want you to worry.

270
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:36,750
Can you can the "Big Sister Act"
for just one night?

271
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,555
The fire was years ago.
You got me out. Okay?

272
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:42,344
I got you out.
I didn't get mom out.

273
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:43,627
I didn't get dad out.

274
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:46,278
Not "Didn't".
"Couldn't".

275
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,271
Could not. Not your fault.

276
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,574
Just like Josh, it's not your fault Alex.

277
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:56,417
You really gotta stop
blaming yourself,

278
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,946
or the whole fucking thing
is gonna to start again.

279
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,903
The therapy, the nightmares, everything.

280
00:29:01,903 --> 00:29:03,722
No, it isn't.

281
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,792
It's nothing like last time.

282
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:14,697
But something's going on.

283
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,355
Something bad.

284
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:24,792
I'm gonna find out what it is.

285
00:30:03,272 --> 00:30:05,139
Ready to play, Alex?

286
00:30:12,334 --> 00:30:16,312
I can smell your fear.

287
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:30,045
I'm looking for a dock worker
named Etchison.

288
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,513
- That's him over there.
- Is that him?

289
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:42,109
Mr. Etchison?

290
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,918
Sweetheart, you can call me
anything you like.

291
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:47,984
Please. I don't have time for your games.

292
00:30:47,984 --> 00:30:49,352
Well that's a damn shame.

293
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:50,640
'could be fun.

294
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,622
Oaky. Let's talk about the opal.

295
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:56,409
The jewel?

296
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:58,497
I don't know what you're
talk'n about.

297
00:30:58,497 --> 00:31:02,178
That's odd. Your friend Clegg knew
exactly wat I was talking about.

298
00:31:02,178 --> 00:31:03,426
I don't know him either.

299
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:04,727
I think you do.

300
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:10,001
Middle aged guy, runs a pawn shop.
Ratted you out at the first snip of a lawsuit.

301
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:14,219
Alright. What's the deal?

302
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:15,376
Are you a cop?

303
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:19,495
No. And we don't ever have to involve
them if you tell me where you got it.

304
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:25,409
Out of that statue. After the accident.

305
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:28,448
You must have seen it on the news.
It killed a guy.

306
00:31:28,448 --> 00:31:29,959
The Beaumont piece?

307
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,241
How the hell should I know?

308
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:34,177
There was some guy who had
bought it. Yeah.

309
00:31:37,365 --> 00:31:41,375
Hey. Like, give me a couple hndred.
Did I get fucked?

310
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:44,178
Royally.

311
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:41,421
Alexandra.
How nice to see you again.

312
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:53,259
Mr. Beaumont, I am so sorry
about what happened.

313
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:57,203
Yes. Irreplaceable.
One of a kind.

314
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:02,203
We are talking about Ed Finney,
your assistant, right?

315
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:05,491
Oh yes.
Yes of course.

316
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:10,460
Well, if you are not too
broken up about him,

317
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,945
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about the sculpture.

318
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:15,069
Anything you wish.

319
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:19,507
Well, the newspapers seem more concerned
with the details of the accident

320
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:22,353
than a crane operator and such.
- That drunken swine.

321
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:26,009
and less concerned about
the details of the statue itself.

322
00:33:26,732 --> 00:33:27,990
Was it bejeweled?

323
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,938
No.
No, undecorated.

324
00:33:29,938 --> 00:33:31,385
A likeness of Ahura Mazda.

325
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:35,093
One of the few to have been made
after the Islamic conversion.

326
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:37,759
I tell you what. Here uh...

327
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:40,237
Let me show you something.

328
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:42,223
You'll be interested in this,
I think.

329
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:45,174
Any new treasures at the auction house?

330
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:54,437
Geez!

331
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:56,114
Asshole!

332
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:57,649
Gotcha.

333
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:15,726
Wow.

334
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:19,253
My room of t Lost Gods.

335
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:23,575
Once worshipped, now...
...forgotten.

336
00:34:24,258 --> 00:34:27,053
Every culture of ancient history.

337
00:34:27,586 --> 00:34:29,560
See that?
Down there.

338
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,301
That was the space reserved
for Ahura Mazda.

339
00:34:33,301 --> 00:34:37,249
Yes, what exactly is Ahura Mazda?

340
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:40,168
It's the objects I collect. Alex.

341
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:42,059
It's not theologies they represent.

342
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:45,452
But for what it's worth,
he was a monotheistic diety

343
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,544
So he was a god of good then.

344
00:34:50,544 --> 00:34:51,880
Certainly.

345
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:58,461
Interestingly though, legend has
it that, uh, the opposing force

346
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:01,335
if you will, is actually his own shadows.

347
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:05,348
So, in a way, he himself was
the source of evil.

348
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:09,794
There's someone at the University
I'd like to put you onto.

349
00:35:10,186 --> 00:35:13,992
A very smart woman. She has done some
catalog descriptions for me in the past.

350
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:19,563
She could be of some help.
Provided you catch her in a good mood.

351
00:35:28,907 --> 00:35:31,213
Hey. Who's the teacher's pet, huh?

352
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:34,315
Why the hell are you working
in the dark man?

353
00:35:37,249 --> 00:35:39,103
Wait a minute. Who are you?

354
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:44,846
What the fuck?

355
00:35:47,561 --> 00:35:48,651
Oh my g...

356
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:53,787
Am I to understand this is not
something you wish to see?

357
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,704
Uh huh.

358
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,201
Very well.

359
00:36:01,241 --> 00:36:03,861
My eyes!
My eyes!

360
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:08,899
Oh my god.
I can't see.

361
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:10,910
I can't see.

362
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,166
You bastard!

363
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:16,180
My eyes!

364
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:25,163
My eyes.

365
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:30,813
Alex.

366
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:34,389
Alex!

367
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:37,944
Alex! Raymond! What's the matter?

368
00:36:49,303 --> 00:36:50,449
Sorry.

369
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:53,758
I don't know what happened.

370
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,142
You fainted.

371
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:58,637
Can I get you a drink or something?
Some water?

372
00:36:58,637 --> 00:37:00,358
No.

373
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:05,863
No. I'm fine.

374
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,151
I guess I'm just under a lot of stress,

375
00:37:10,274 --> 00:37:12,367
but I'm fine. Honestly.

376
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:13,769
Honestly?

377
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:18,500
I hope you'll be well enough
to attend my party.

378
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,338
What it was, to celebrate my acquisition.

379
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,399
Your boss, Mr. Merritt
received the invitations.

380
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,904
You and your charming sister
should be most welcome.

381
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:34,770
Well thank you. I'd like to,

382
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:37,973
but I think I may be busy.

383
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,322
...little more...

384
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:46,651
Little more.
Hold on.

385
00:37:46,651 --> 00:37:50,879
- Ah. Back two feet.
- Okay professor.

386
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,263
Good. Good.
That's good.

387
00:37:52,263 --> 00:37:54,799
I told the Dean's office that the
paperwork would be there tomorrow.

388
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:55,969
I'm Busy.

389
00:37:56,169 --> 00:37:57,785
Okay. Good.

390
00:37:58,018 --> 00:38:00,067
I think you are mistaking
me for someone else.

391
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:04,440
I'm Alex. Raymond Beaumont must
have called you, about me?

392
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,507
Oh yeah. What an insufferable prick that man is.

393
00:38:07,507 --> 00:38:10,315
Still, it's not your problem.
Unless, of course, you're

394
00:38:10,515 --> 00:38:12,007
stupid enough to be working for him.

395
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:12,945
No.

396
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:13,781
Or sleeping with him?

397
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:15,264
Eh-huh.
No.

398
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:18,645
Oh good. Well that establishes your
discerning good taste.

399
00:38:18,645 --> 00:38:21,450
A little...uh...no, no no no no.
That's not gonna work.

400
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:23,361
Up stage.

401
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,130
Uh huh? What can I for you?

402
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,352
Absolutely nothing at all, until I
can get your full attention.

403
00:38:31,002 --> 00:38:32,986
I like you.

404
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:35,108
I'm just interfering here anyway.

405
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:38,734
This is a, uh, co-production.
Folklore department. That's me.

406
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,047
Drama department. That's not me.

407
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:42,794
As soon as Professor Benson gets here

408
00:38:42,794 --> 00:38:45,517
I'm gonna be run off to him.

409
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:49,838
The stone of the secret fire was first written
by the Empersia, around

410
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:51,514
Around 900 years ago.

411
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:56,091
A court sorcerer is said to have
imprisoned an evil spirit within it.

412
00:38:56,091 --> 00:38:57,415
An evil spirit?

413
00:38:57,415 --> 00:39:00,876
Yes. A creature from the
spaces between the worlds.

414
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,341
A Djinn.

415
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,884
A Djinn?

416
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:06,343
A genie?

417
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:10,946
Now hold on a minute. Froget what our
culture has made of the Djinn.

418
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:12,312
Forget Barbars Eden.

419
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:13,661
Forget Robin Williams.

420
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:18,348
To the peoples of ancient Arabia,
the Djinn was not cute nor funny.

421
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:20,675
It was something else entirely.

422
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:22,976
It was the face of fear itself.

423
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:25,377
How's it look?

424
00:39:28,214 --> 00:39:29,427
You tell me.

425
00:39:38,735 --> 00:39:40,283
Wow.

426
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,849
I'm glad you approve.

427
00:39:44,002 --> 00:39:46,471
Um. You want to try something else?

428
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:49,363
A different style maybe?
Tighter?

429
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:52,705
Oh, no. Don't like feeling confined.

430
00:39:52,705 --> 00:39:54,328
I had enough of that.

431
00:39:54,874 --> 00:39:57,662
Okay then, follow me.

432
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:57,662
With pleasure.

433
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,294
Now, will this be cash or charge Mr....?

434
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:20,006
Demerest.
Nathaniel Demerest

435
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:21,540
Call Me Nathaniel.

436
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:24,675
Okay Nathaniel.
Cash or charge?

437
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:26,923
Which would you prefer?

438
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:30,771
I don't know?
Cash?

439
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:32,029
Done.

440
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,545
Oh.

441
00:40:36,973 --> 00:40:40,695
This is my first day in your world.
Ariella

442
00:40:41,476 --> 00:40:44,166
I am pleased to see beauty as a constant.

443
00:40:44,628 --> 00:40:48,417
Does it bother you... knowing that
your beauty will fade?

444
00:40:49,086 --> 00:40:53,925
That your looking glass will day by day
tell you a long and unhappy story?

445
00:40:56,676 --> 00:41:03,127
Well. I mean... That's life. Right?
It happens to all of us.

446
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:03,972
Like it or not.

447
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:05,442
It doesn't have to, Ariella.

448
00:41:05,442 --> 00:41:06,773
Ask.

449
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:09,782
Ask and see what happens.

450
00:41:09,782 --> 00:41:13,261
Ask for an end to change.
An end to decay.

451
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:16,554
Say, "I wish to be beautiful forever."

452
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:21,673
I wish to be beautiful forever.

453
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,790
Pleasure doing business with you.

454
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:39,497
Soon I will find you.

455
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,820
...would you like to do this some other time?

456
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,917
No.  I'm a... I'm...

457
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:48,187
AH!

458
00:41:51,173 --> 00:41:53,759
I just wanted Professor Derleth
to check out my costume.

459
00:41:54,183 --> 00:41:55,941
Well obviously it's scary enough.

460
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:57,690
Go back to rehearsal.

461
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:00,648
Thanks.

462
00:42:02,434 --> 00:42:03,786
You alright?

463
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:05,805
Yes.

464
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:10,413
Okay. The Djinn, the word is both
plural and singular by the way,

465
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:13,855
are a race created after the angels,
but before mankind.

466
00:42:13,855 --> 00:42:16,633
Powerful. Magical. Evil.

467
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:18,632
Evil?

468
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:23,093
I though that genies granted wishes.
That's what the myths say.

469
00:42:23,093 --> 00:42:28,410
They're obliged, but their true motivation is
always usurping this world for themselves.

470
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,516
I never heard that.
What I heard was...

471
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:31,723
A sweetened fable.

472
00:42:32,277 --> 00:42:35,285
Over the centuries, faith became fairytales.

473
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:39,237
We avoided our terror by taming
it into fictions and inventing stories

474
00:42:39,237 --> 00:42:41,802
of magical lamps to rock our
children to sleep.

475
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:43,963
And the old stories are darker.

476
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:45,716
Much darker.

477
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,297
In the old writings, the Djinn is everything
that we ever feared.

478
00:42:50,297 --> 00:42:54,737
An utterly inhuman race of beings,
that mean us harm.

479
00:42:55,277 --> 00:42:56,848
Older than our oldest history.

480
00:42:56,848 --> 00:42:59,364
More powerful than our worst imagining

481
00:42:59,364 --> 00:43:02,392
and driven by an ancient and endless malevolence.

482
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:20,251
Detective Nathanson.

483
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,436
Yeah?

484
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:24,865
I was told downstairs you were in
charge of the Aickman investigation.

485
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:26,374
I was.

486
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:33,952
The case is closed. At least as far as
homicide is concerned.

487
00:43:33,952 --> 00:43:35,846
Unless you got something to tell me.

488
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,693
Actually, I was hoping you
had something to tell me.

489
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:42,020
Oh, really? And what would that be?

490
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,960
Nothing much.
An address.

491
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,889
A woman called Alexandra.

492
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:50,978
What the hell makes you think
I can give you her address?

493
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:56,251
What's your interest in this case anyway?

494
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,691
Why do you keep looking over there?

495
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:03,421
You see that guy?
Guilty as sin.

496
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:06,110
Walked on 7 counts.
Walked each time.

497
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,274
Made of teflon makes me sick.
You know what I would like?

498
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:10,543
I'd love to know.

499
00:44:11,977 --> 00:44:14,978
Just once I'd like it to be easy.
I would like to nail that prick

500
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:15,757
Dent to the rights.

501
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:19,032
Murder One. Everybody's an eyewitness.

502
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:57,823
Alexandra

503
00:44:58,135 --> 00:44:59,475
Hey! You!

504
00:45:45,588 --> 00:45:47,575
The stone of the secret fire

505
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:51,506
created by a great Persian sorcerer
to save his people from the Djinn.

506
00:45:51,506 --> 00:45:53,515
is as much a curse as a blessing.

507
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:56,273
because it is a doorway between the worlds.

508
00:45:56,273 --> 00:45:59,059
And like all doors, can be opened
from either side.

509
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:03,528
Adjinn, once freed, can use the stone
to bring forth his race to our reality,

510
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,478
and overwhelm humanity.

511
00:46:05,872 --> 00:46:09,398
But the Djinn must first charge the stone
by gathering the souls of humans

512
00:46:09,598 --> 00:46:11,343
who have had a single wish granted...

513
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:14,492
He must then activate it,
by finding the human who woke him

514
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:17,370
into this world, and granting
him 3 wishes.

515
00:46:17,487 --> 00:46:20,931
The sole limitation to the Djinn's
power is that it may only be

516
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:22,760
used in the service of wishes.

517
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:36,051
Sorry sir. We're closed.

518
00:46:36,051 --> 00:46:38,385
I am trying to locate an employee.

519
00:46:39,071 --> 00:46:41,563
- No on here. Just the boss.
- Alright, I'll talk to the boss.

520
00:46:41,563 --> 00:46:43,119
Open the doors please.

521
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,577
It's appointments only
after business hours. Okay?

522
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:47,677
You're becoming a bother little man.

523
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:48,795
Open

524
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:50,332
the doors.

525
00:46:55,066 --> 00:46:57,067
Okay pal. It is time for you to go.

526
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:01,762
Get out of my way.

527
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:04,075
I don't think so asshole.

528
00:47:05,244 --> 00:47:08,571
Do you have any idea how frustrating
it is to have unlimited power,

529
00:47:08,571 --> 00:47:12,287
and only be able to use it when some
worm asks you for something?

530
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,986
No. I can't say that I do.
I can't say I give a shit either.

531
00:47:15,986 --> 00:47:17,697
Ask me for something.

532
00:47:17,697 --> 00:47:21,308
Okay.
I want you to leave.

533
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:30,211
No. No.
I have to get inside.

534
00:47:30,211 --> 00:47:32,809
Well now, you's have to go through me.

535
00:47:34,336 --> 00:47:36,507
And that is something I would love to see.

536
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:11,064
Who the hell are you?
How'd you get in here?

537
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:14,064
The guard opened up on me.

538
00:48:14,794 --> 00:48:16,928
I wonder if I could ask your help.

539
00:48:19,695 --> 00:48:21,907
I'm looking for Alexandra Amberson.

540
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:27,092
Ale.. Sh.. She, she was off today.
I asked you who you were.

541
00:48:27,092 --> 00:48:28,993
Someone she's expecting.

542
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,586
Prehaps you'd be so kind as to
give me her home address.

543
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:37,344
Wait a minute. If she knows you,
how come you don't have her address?

544
00:48:37,826 --> 00:48:40,960
I said she's expecting me.
I didn't say she knows me.

545
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,492
Oh. Well in that case, um.
Maybe you better e-mail her,

546
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:49,297
because I can't give you her address.
You understand.

547
00:48:49,297 --> 00:48:50,946
Perfectly.

548
00:48:51,634 --> 00:48:53,522
Would you happen to know
where she is right now?

549
00:48:53,522 --> 00:48:54,976
Yes. I would.

550
00:48:54,976 --> 00:48:58,314
- would you tell me?
- No. I wouldn't.

551
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:07,184
Hey, hey!
That's a very valuable piece.

552
00:49:08,504 --> 00:49:09,912
Really?

553
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:13,556
You would like it to be 100
times its valuable?

554
00:49:15,498 --> 00:49:17,869
Would I like it to be 100
times more valuable?

555
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:19,266
Yes.

556
00:49:28,408 --> 00:49:30,057
Holy shit.

557
00:49:32,711 --> 00:49:34,259
What are you,
David Copperfield or something?

558
00:49:34,259 --> 00:49:35,233
How'd you do that?

559
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:37,764
Old family secret.

560
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:40,191
Where is Alexandra?

561
00:49:40,191 --> 00:49:47,943
Ahhh. Well, I'm sorry, but I don't
really feel, um, comfortable telling you.

562
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,059
What would make you
comfortable Nick?

563
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:51,972
Name it.

564
00:49:53,228 --> 00:49:54,062
What's my limit?

565
00:49:54,478 --> 00:49:55,843
Your imagination.

566
00:49:57,499 --> 00:50:01,411
Well, I am not a greedy man...
How about a million dollars?

567
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:04,862
Done.

568
00:50:06,331 --> 00:50:08,067
Let's just see.

569
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:13,334
Oh. Wait a minute. You forgotten
to fill in the beneficiary.

570
00:50:13,334 --> 00:50:16,569
Oh silly. It's my son Nick.

571
00:50:17,524 --> 00:50:20,894
He owns a very
prestigious auction house.

572
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:25,149
There you go. Thanks for your business
Mrs. Merritt. Enjoy your flight.

573
00:50:32,435 --> 00:50:34,974
Hey. Yourself.

574
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:36,703
What the hell are you doing?

575
00:50:36,919 --> 00:50:38,633
Learning the rules of the game.

576
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:42,617
I leave work early to get you back
the car, and you're not even ready.

577
00:50:42,817 --> 00:50:44,082
Um Hm.

578
00:50:44,282 --> 00:50:46,333
Basketball?

579
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:50,565
Damn.
I lost track of time.

580
00:50:50,565 --> 00:50:54,258
Okay. Just uh.
Just give me a second. Okay?

581
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:14,055
Okay. That was great.
Come on everybody. Let's take a five.

582
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:18,614
Stillness Miss Amberson.
That's how I did it.

583
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:20,107
Stillness. Just like you said.

584
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:22,552
Yes. Go
Go.

585
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:26,142
Can I have your phone again?

586
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:30,040
God. Who is this woman anyway?

587
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,177
Damn, it's a machine.

588
00:51:42,924 --> 00:51:45,727
Professor Derleth, this is Alex.
Again.

589
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:50,411
I really need to talk to you as
soon as possible. Please call me back.

590
00:51:50,981 --> 00:51:52,719
Thank you.

591
00:51:57,313 --> 00:51:58,861
Excuse me miss.

592
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:01,014
Do you mind terribly if I borrow your phone?

593
00:52:01,649 --> 00:52:03,281
I'd be happy to pay for the call.

594
00:52:03,602 --> 00:52:04,821
That's Okay.

595
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,202
Alright. That ought to keep
you from tripping. Go.

596
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,197
Nobody home.

597
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:30,981
Useful little items, arent they?

598
00:53:45,028 --> 00:53:49,188
I claim that, which is old.

599
00:53:53,726 --> 00:53:55,904
- Hello.
- Miss Amberson

600
00:53:55,904 --> 00:53:59,823
It's detective Nathanson.
We need to talk.

601
00:54:06,716 --> 00:54:10,375
There was a guy here looking for you.
I think...

602
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:37,262
Only you can end their pain Alexandra.
Only you can free them.

603
00:55:45,046 --> 00:55:48,733
Patience, friends.

604
00:55:48,733 --> 00:55:52,453
Patience.

605
00:56:07,217 --> 00:56:10,423
Hi, Uh... Can I come in?

606
00:56:15,702 --> 00:56:20,291
The stone is charged. It's charged with
people's souls, fed with their fear.

607
00:56:20,783 --> 00:56:23,165
And the Djinn is after me.
I need to know what the hell to do.

608
00:56:23,165 --> 00:56:25,320
Alexandra, this is the 20th century.

609
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,888
Don't you think all that sounds
a little unlikely?

610
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:29,972
Would you like something to drink,
by the way?

611
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:34,904
No.
Thank you.

612
00:56:34,904 --> 00:56:36,766
Well, I would.

613
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,813
This is a nice cabinet, isn't it?

614
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:42,759
Your boss would really like this.

615
00:56:42,759 --> 00:56:45,285
My boss? I never told you who I work for.

616
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:47,923
You didn't?

617
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:52,615
Then how would I know?

618
00:56:54,388 --> 00:56:55,848
Maybe Beaumont mentioned it?

619
00:56:56,367 --> 00:56:58,693
Oh, yeah!
He did.

620
00:57:02,104 --> 00:57:04,133
Let me explain.

621
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:07,515
You are obviously looking for some piece
of magic. Some spell

622
00:57:07,515 --> 00:57:11,228
to get rid of this hypothetical Djinn
that you're talking about. right?

623
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,124
Yes.

624
00:57:15,138 --> 00:57:17,647
They certainly existed.

625
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:19,935
- You are cold?
- No, I'm fine.

626
00:57:20,143 --> 00:57:21,499
Would you like me to put the heat on?

627
00:57:21,812 --> 00:57:23,793
No. Just please continue.

628
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:26,056
Alright...

629
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:27,256
Where was I?

630
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:31,438
Oh yeah! Spells, sorcerers.
Alexandra.

631
00:57:31,438 --> 00:57:35,767
You were born into an age of reason
and an age of science.

632
00:57:36,457 --> 00:57:38,808
All the sorcerers are dead

633
00:57:39,017 --> 00:57:42,935
and all the spells lost, to time.

634
00:57:43,135 --> 00:57:46,306
But the Djinn itself.
The Djinn, if it existed.

635
00:57:46,306 --> 00:57:49,284
Would be all there was.

636
00:57:49,726 --> 00:57:51,431
Imagine that.

637
00:57:51,631 --> 00:57:54,866
The only magical thing
in a rationalist world.

638
00:57:56,013 --> 00:57:59,246
A vulnerable world of disbelief.

639
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:03,000
Where no reason would ever rescue you.

640
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:05,502
Nor Science save you.

641
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:11,759
He would have a fine old time.
Wouldn't he?

642
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:15,332
This is no joke.

643
00:58:15,332 --> 00:58:18,051
No, it's not funny.

644
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:20,043
Are you hungry?

645
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,923
I'm not hungry. I'm not thirsty.
I'm not...

646
00:58:24,123 --> 00:58:27,196
Why do you keep trying
to do things for m...?

647
00:58:38,035 --> 00:58:39,391
I'm sorry.

648
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:42,968
I guess I'm just a little tense.

649
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:49,610
I guess.

650
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,051
But I'm fine.

651
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:55,121
Alright.

652
00:58:56,473 --> 00:58:57,904
Where were we?

653
00:58:57,904 --> 00:58:59,932
Oh, yes.

654
00:59:00,826 --> 00:59:02,630
No spells.

655
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,426
No hope.

656
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:07,441
If there's no hope. No magic.

657
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:11,090
I'll have to rely on myself.

658
00:59:13,905 --> 00:59:16,929
Match wits with a creature older than time.

659
00:59:17,764 --> 00:59:21,100
Match wits with a prince
of the Dark Dominions.

660
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:26,760
Pit your tiny 20th century brain
against one that walked

661
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,282
the spaces between the worlds,

662
00:59:30,014 --> 00:59:34,029
and trod the wings of angels
beneath his concrete feet.

663
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:41,628
Oh Alexandra, you're a delight.
Really. You are.

664
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:44,353
I'm glad I can amuse you.

665
00:59:45,126 --> 00:59:49,540
Oh. I hurt your feelings.
I'm sorry.

666
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,389
Let me make it up to you.

667
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:53,529
What can I do?

668
00:59:55,511 --> 00:59:56,553
I must be going now.

669
01:00:00,307 --> 01:00:01,975
Sit down!

670
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:06,563
Please.

671
01:00:07,085 --> 01:00:08,545
Sit down.

672
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:13,967
Where's Wendy?

673
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:17,581
Bedroom.
But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

674
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:20,860
Messy.
I needed her face.

675
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,204
You killed her?

676
01:00:22,413 --> 01:00:26,375
Actually, I can't kill anyone.
Not unless they wish me to.

677
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:28,774
Your research should have told you that.

678
01:00:28,982 --> 01:00:30,928
She didn't wish to be dead

679
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:33,308
You lying sack of shit!

680
01:00:33,508 --> 01:00:37,480
I showed her my true face.
Her reaction wasn't very flattering.

681
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,328
As a matter of fact,
she got down right hysterical.

682
01:00:44,428 --> 01:00:48,875
I merely asked her if she if she wished
to be released from her fear.

683
01:00:51,297 --> 01:00:54,720
You're a dangerous person to know,
Alexandra.

684
01:00:55,772 --> 01:00:58,074
Your scientist friend. Your boss.

685
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,264
The policemen. Wendy.

686
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:02,790
By the bye.

687
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,938
Where is that tasty little sister
of yours today?

688
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,933
If you harm Shannon

689
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,674
I kill to you.

690
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,218
Spare me child.

691
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,929
Behold my true face.

692
01:01:19,129 --> 01:01:20,224
Oh my god.

693
01:01:20,224 --> 01:01:24,456
Yes.
The shit just hit the fan. Didn't it?

694
01:01:24,977 --> 01:01:27,377
Let's get this over with, shall we?

695
01:01:27,577 --> 01:01:31,074
Make your wishes.

696
01:01:32,797 --> 01:01:35,180
Three wishes Alexandra.

697
01:01:35,613 --> 01:01:39,844
Doesn't that intrigue you?
Just a little?

698
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,182
Anything you want.

699
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:45,115
- Anything?
- You ask for anything

700
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:47,917
I must grant it.

701
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:53,112
A trip to the moon.
A visit to Cairo Egypt.

702
01:01:53,312 --> 01:01:55,249
What happens if I wished you dead?

703
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:57,927
Why, how remarkably original
Alexandra.

704
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:02,620
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you one free wish.

705
01:02:03,454 --> 01:02:08,588
A sample. Get you into the
spirit of the game.

706
01:02:08,588 --> 01:02:12,108
Alright. I want you to destroy yourself.

707
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:13,967
Blow your brains out.

708
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:15,887
RIGHT NOW!

709
01:02:15,887 --> 01:02:17,609
Very well.

710
01:02:23,891 --> 01:02:27,020
That which is eternal cannot die.

711
01:02:27,437 --> 01:02:32,442
But if it's any consolation sweet Alex,
that hurt like hell.

712
01:02:33,364 --> 01:02:39,854
Now.
Make your three wishes.

713
01:02:41,201 --> 01:02:44,225
I always tell my girls
to know their opponent.

714
01:02:50,814 --> 01:02:52,382
So...

715
01:02:53,192 --> 01:02:55,173
I think I will, make a wish.

716
01:02:56,050 --> 01:02:57,400
Good.

717
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,927
I wish...

718
01:03:00,804 --> 01:03:03,098
to know what you are.

719
01:03:06,643 --> 01:03:08,207
What are doing?

720
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,976
Granting your wish.

721
01:03:24,474 --> 01:03:27,710
You wish to know what I am.

722
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,418
To you, I am this.

723
01:03:31,131 --> 01:03:34,355
The cry of the abandoned child.

724
01:03:34,622 --> 01:03:37,019
The winter of the whipped beast

725
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:41,665
I am the face that stares back
at you from the shadow

726
01:03:41,665 --> 01:03:43,604
do you mirrror?

727
01:03:44,045 --> 01:03:46,682
The hollowness, at the heart of all

728
01:03:46,682 --> 01:03:49,083
your hopes, Alexandra.

729
01:03:49,813 --> 01:03:54,975
I am despair.

730
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:11,970
Shit.

731
01:04:13,378 --> 01:04:17,491
'careful what you wish for.

732
01:04:58,007 --> 01:05:02,189
So. How do you like me so far?

733
01:05:02,389 --> 01:05:05,349
I didn't wish for this.
You're supposed to be outside.

734
01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:06,794
You're not supposed to be here.

735
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:09,710
I am bound by that which I bind.

736
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:13,251
Contained and by that which I contain.

737
01:05:13,251 --> 01:05:15,105
This isn't what I wanted.

738
01:05:15,105 --> 01:05:20,023
Well then. Word your
wishes more carefully.

739
01:05:26,372 --> 01:05:31,202
Oh Alexandra. You left
your sister all alone.

740
01:05:31,202 --> 01:05:35,233
Not to worry. I'll find her and
keep her company.

741
01:05:35,337 --> 01:05:36,925
Don't you go near her.

742
01:05:36,925 --> 01:05:38,389
I mighr have to.

743
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:43,238
You know how persuasive the
pain of loved ones can be.

744
01:05:43,831 --> 01:05:44,438
No.

745
01:05:50,978 --> 01:05:54,419
Stop me then.
Wish yourself back.

746
01:05:54,836 --> 01:05:59,132
I wish I was in my apartment.
Right now. Without you.

747
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,538
Shannon?

748
01:06:10,373 --> 01:06:14,921
Shannon, where are you?
We got to get out of here.

749
01:06:21,902 --> 01:06:25,088
Alex. Waited as long as I could.
Gone to Beaumont's party.

750
01:06:25,088 --> 01:06:26,738
Join us if you can!
Shannon.

751
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:33,528
Two wishes in. We're so connected now.

752
01:06:33,628 --> 01:06:38,792
Wherever you go, there I'll be.
Wherever you are, I will find you.

753
01:06:39,882 --> 01:06:41,342
FUCK YOU!

754
01:07:08,766 --> 01:07:11,300
Going my way?

755
01:07:43,489 --> 01:07:46,183
Excuse me ma'am. Ah..
Is your name on the list?

756
01:07:46,183 --> 01:07:49,476
You have got to help me.
This guy is crazy. He's dangerous.

757
01:07:49,476 --> 01:07:51,654
He broke my window.
He is trying to kill me.

758
01:08:03,092 --> 01:08:07,758
Excuse me sir.
Is Mr. Beaumont expecting you?

759
01:08:08,723 --> 01:08:11,330
I asked you a question.
Sir.

760
01:08:12,477 --> 01:08:14,875
Am I expected? Yes.

761
01:08:15,084 --> 01:08:17,273
I wouldn't be here, if it weren't
for Mr. Beaumont.

762
01:08:17,482 --> 01:08:19,298
Well that sounds good.

763
01:08:20,044 --> 01:08:22,176
But it doesn't sound like an invitation.

764
01:08:22,176 --> 01:08:25,486
I don't care what it sounds like.
Step aside.

765
01:08:25,636 --> 01:08:27,778
Let me make this real simple for you.

766
01:08:27,778 --> 01:08:31,246
If your name isn't on the list,
you don't get in.

767
01:08:33,227 --> 01:08:35,000
I've dealt with your type before.

768
01:08:35,313 --> 01:08:38,754
Mister, you've never even
met my type before.

769
01:08:39,067 --> 01:08:42,925
I am going through that door,
and you will not to stop me.

770
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:45,695
Is that perfectly clear,
doorman?

771
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:48,764
Doorman? The name is Valentine.

772
01:08:48,868 --> 01:08:51,058
Johnny Valentine.

773
01:08:51,579 --> 01:08:53,143
You remember that when they ask

774
01:08:53,352 --> 01:08:55,020
how you lost your eye.

775
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:57,314
Forgive my brassness.

776
01:08:57,523 --> 01:09:02,225
My eagerness for the end game has skewed
my judgement. I'll make you a deal.

777
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:04,167
I don't make deals.

778
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:05,760
What else do you have to do?

779
01:09:06,178 --> 01:09:10,545
Tonight.
Keep assholes out of parties.

780
01:09:10,545 --> 01:09:12,643
And what about tomorrow?

781
01:09:12,851 --> 01:09:15,547
Surely you are not telling
me this is all you can do.

782
01:09:16,918 --> 01:09:19,087
Nor all you ever have done.

783
01:09:19,629 --> 01:09:22,340
It certainly isn't all you ever wished for.

784
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:27,866
Tell me the truth. Don't you grow weary
of this job, day in and day out?

785
01:09:28,492 --> 01:09:31,874
Wouldn't you like to escape to
a more exciting profession?

786
01:09:31,874 --> 01:09:34,667
What the FUCK does that have
to do with you?

787
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:36,104
Everything.

788
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:40,379
Take the chance Johnny.
Answer the question.

789
01:09:40,692 --> 01:09:44,320
Would you like to escape?

790
01:09:47,626 --> 01:09:49,180
Yeah.

791
01:09:49,764 --> 01:09:52,060
As you wish.

792
01:09:57,897 --> 01:10:00,504
Houdini did it in two and a half minutes.

793
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:21,102
Excuse me.

794
01:10:26,524 --> 01:10:28,733
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

795
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:33,978
Shannon?

796
01:10:34,966 --> 01:10:36,387
Sorry.

797
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:49,654
Alex, I didn't know you were com...
What are you doing?

798
01:10:49,654 --> 01:10:51,477
I'm trying to get you outta here.
Come on. We gotta go.

799
01:10:51,477 --> 01:10:52,501
Get the hell off of me.

800
01:10:52,501 --> 01:10:54,161
Shannon. We have got to leave now.

801
01:10:54,161 --> 01:10:55,228
Trust me.

802
01:10:55,228 --> 01:10:59,418
No. Trust me. you obviously haven't
seen Beaumont's new friend.

803
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:01,967
You remember the guy from
the basketball court?

804
01:11:08,275 --> 01:11:10,302
Shannon.
Shannon!

805
01:11:10,502 --> 01:11:13,260
...and I was at Cindy's party, of course,
the one where they served the

806
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:17,089
divorce papers in the middle of dinner.
It was hysterical.

807
01:11:17,089 --> 01:11:18,615
People talked about it for a year.

808
01:11:18,615 --> 01:11:19,647
Really?

809
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:25,304
I remember a certain potentate date, whose
last party was talked about for centuries.

810
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,495
What do you mean, it went down in history?

811
01:11:28,695 --> 01:11:29,695
Yes.

812
01:11:30,075 --> 01:11:33,450
God, how I'd love to
host a party like that.

813
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,728
Shannon!

814
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:41,858
As you wish.

815
01:11:45,403 --> 01:11:47,639
Ted, you can see right through me.

816
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:47,237
My God.

817
01:12:47,445 --> 01:12:49,948
Not yet, human.

818
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:54,119
Soon. Very soon I will be...

819
01:13:06,694 --> 01:13:08,494
Shannon?

820
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,636
Shannon!

821
01:13:29,902 --> 01:13:32,452
Perimeter! Everybody get to the house now!

822
01:13:32,452 --> 01:13:33,744
Shannon!

823
01:14:11,908 --> 01:14:15,839
We have unfinished business.

824
01:14:15,839 --> 01:14:17,016
It's going to stay unfinished.

825
01:14:18,814 --> 01:14:21,813
Listen to their screams child.

826
01:14:22,628 --> 01:14:27,026
Listen to their music of their agony.

827
01:14:28,412 --> 01:14:29,320
You Bastard!

828
01:14:29,648 --> 01:14:32,866
You can save them, Alexandra.

829
01:14:34,063 --> 01:14:36,620
Just wish it away.

830
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:40,170
No. I won't.
I can't.

831
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:44,030
My patience wears thin.

832
01:14:48,748 --> 01:14:51,739
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

833
01:14:52,266 --> 01:14:53,825
Where's your third wish then?

834
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:57,474
I don't need you dead Alexandra.

835
01:14:58,018 --> 01:15:01,019
I just need you to wish you were a...

836
01:15:11,014 --> 01:15:14,771
Run...
...Run

837
01:15:28,016 --> 01:15:30,743
- Raymond.
- Alex. Alex, what is going on here?

838
01:15:30,743 --> 01:15:33,719
Shannon.
Raymond. Have you seen Shannon?

839
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:36,908
Raymond. Raymond?

840
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:38,459
Gosh, Raymond?

841
01:16:51,859 --> 01:16:54,962
Hey miss. Come with us.
We're trying to get this under control.

842
01:16:54,962 --> 01:16:57,390
Get out of here.
Get OUT!

843
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:58,586
He's coming!

844
01:18:03,185 --> 01:18:06,510
Please. We have got to go!
We have got to...

845
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:09,286
it's not going to do any good!

846
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:34,448
Shannon!

847
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:05,130
No more doors.
No more rooms.

848
01:19:05,506 --> 01:19:08,056
No more excuses.

849
01:19:08,256 --> 01:19:10,653
Make your wish.

850
01:19:10,853 --> 01:19:11,797
I will not wish.

851
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:13,986
Really?

852
01:19:14,925 --> 01:19:19,513
Not even when I show you the
latest addition to Beaumont's collection.

853
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:23,251
The final flowering of his wish.

854
01:19:23,251 --> 01:19:23,424
What?

855
01:19:23,684 --> 01:19:26,082
A little masterpiece of my own.

856
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:29,106
I call it "SISTER".

857
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:32,776
"WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"

858
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:34,231
Oh god.

859
01:19:36,469 --> 01:19:37,475
Shannon!

860
01:19:37,475 --> 01:19:40,020
Rather a good likeness,
don't you think?

861
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,949
I especially relish...

862
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:45,164
the 'trapped-animal' look in the eyes.

863
01:19:45,373 --> 01:19:48,802
You vicious son of a BITCH!

864
01:19:49,002 --> 01:19:50,836
You don't approve?

865
01:19:51,378 --> 01:19:52,684
Alright then.

866
01:19:52,684 --> 01:19:53,736
FUCK IT!

867
01:19:53,819 --> 01:19:55,591
You know what I say?

868
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:01,114
If you can't beat them,
burn them baby.

869
01:20:10,293 --> 01:20:11,273
Oh no.

870
01:20:11,828 --> 01:20:13,551
Shannon!

871
01:20:13,551 --> 01:20:15,478
Remind you of something?

872
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:26,784
Make your wish.

873
01:20:33,184 --> 01:20:36,753
I suggest you do it quickly, dear.

874
01:20:44,284 --> 01:20:46,110
Oh god.

875
01:20:56,296 --> 01:20:58,073
Stillness...

876
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:07,941
I wish...

877
01:21:08,141 --> 01:21:09,815
Yes?

878
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:19,740
I wish...

879
01:21:20,365 --> 01:21:21,304
Wish on, child.

880
01:21:22,112 --> 01:21:23,471
Stillness...

881
01:21:30,726 --> 01:21:35,421
I wish Mickey Torelli hadn't been
drinking on the job, 2 days ago.

882
01:21:41,883 --> 01:21:43,242
No.

883
01:21:47,556 --> 01:21:49,239
No.

884
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:59,823
No.
Impossible.

885
01:22:00,677 --> 01:22:02,596
Not by...

886
01:22:04,006 --> 01:22:05,670
you!

887
01:22:39,403 --> 01:22:41,296
You should never met me.

888
01:23:02,223 --> 01:23:04,217
I'm surprised you are here in
person Mr. Beaumont.

889
01:23:04,217 --> 01:23:06,411
The works, completely in order.

890
01:23:06,903 --> 01:23:09,123
I've waited 10 years for this piece.

891
01:23:09,646 --> 01:23:11,208
Hey Mickey, watch it!

892
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:13,323
Look! What do you think that is?
Coconuts?

893
01:23:13,323 --> 01:23:16,927
That's a... That.
Pre-Islamic stuff you got in there!

894
01:23:17,127 --> 01:23:17,986
Now slowly. Thanks!

895
01:23:18,793 --> 01:23:20,495
Okay! Got it!

896
01:23:39,255 --> 01:23:43,440
Oh yeah. This will make some
very nice engagement gift.

897
01:23:45,305 --> 01:23:48,391
- Very at least a nice engagement gift.
- Yeah.

898
01:23:52,305 --> 01:23:53,281
Hi Nick.

899
01:23:53,281 --> 01:23:55,260
- You're late.
- Sorry.

900
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:57,139
I'll give you 2000 for them.

901
01:23:59,031 --> 01:24:00,790
So, what are we doing tonight?

902
01:24:03,032 --> 01:24:03,853
"We"?

903
01:24:03,853 --> 01:24:07,493
Ohhh, what's the matter Josh?

904
01:24:07,693 --> 01:24:09,705
Are you afraid of the complications?

905
01:24:10,847 --> 01:24:11,936
You know what?

906
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:15,411
I think this could help.

907
01:24:16,345 --> 01:24:17,778
Does that help?

908
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:26,746
Yeah.

909
01:24:27,445 --> 01:24:31,085
Yeah, where uh...
Where are we going tonight?

910
01:24:32,428 --> 01:24:33,897
Dinner and a movie.

911
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:36,191
With me?

912
01:24:36,391 --> 01:24:37,391
Yeah.

913
01:24:42,618 --> 01:24:44,690
I was thinking more about, um...

914
01:24:45,315 --> 01:24:48,145
...about hotdogs and a ball game.

915
01:24:53,311 --> 01:24:55,018
Yeah.

916
01:24:57,357 --> 01:25:00,715
Um... Are you...
Are you alright?

917
01:25:02,469 --> 01:25:03,925
Alex?

918
