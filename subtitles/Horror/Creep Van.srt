{21422}{21473}Because we do not exist.
{21481}{21529}Well, then neither do I.
{21612}{21706}CARDINAL: When we found you crawling up|the steps of this church, half-dead...
{21708}{21796}it was clear to all of us that|you had been sent to do God's work.
{21798}{21860}- Why can't he do it himself?|- Don't blaspheme.
{21862}{21949}You already lost your memory|as a penance for past sins.

{22011}{22080}I suggest you continue|to heed the call.
{22121}{22189}{y:i}Without us, |{y:i}the world would be in darkness.

{22452}{22534}CARDINAL: An evil that the rest of mankind|has no idea even exists.
{22536}{22646}To you, these monsters are|just evil beings to be vanquished.
{22686}{22737}I'm the one standing there|when they die...

{22784}{22868}For you, my good son,|this is all a test of faith.

{23268}{23318}VAN HELSING: Dracula?|CARDINAL: Yes.
{23328}{23393}{y:i}You've never faced one|{y:i}like this before. 
{23416}{23498}{y:i}Our story begins 450 years ago... 
{23500}{23585}{y:i}when a Transylvanian knight|{y:i}named Valerious the Elder... 
{23591}{23676}{y:i}promised God that his family|{y:i}would never rest nor enter heaven... 
{23678}{23750}{y:i}until they vanquished Dracula|{y:i}from their land. 
{23763}{23810}They have not succeeded...
{23825}{23886}and they are running out of family.
{23908}{24010}CARDINAL: His descendant Boris Valerious,|King of the Gypsies.
{24015}{24076}He disappeared almost 12 months ago.
{24113}{24230}CARDINAL: His only son, Prince Velkan,|and his daughter, Princess Anna.
{24238}{24317}CARDINAL: If the two of them are killed|before Dracula is vanquished...
{24319}{24370}nine generations of their family...
{24372}{24435}will never enter|the gates of St. Peter.
{24450}{24494}{y:i}For more than four centuries... 
{24496}{24561}{y:i}this family has defended|{y:i}our left flank. 
{24563}{24608}They gave their lives.
{24626}{24690}We cannot let them|slip into purgatory.
{24692}{24747}So you're sending me into hell.
{24797}{24830}In a manner.
{24904}{24992}Valerious the Elder left this here|400 years ago.
{25010}{25054}{y:i}We don't know its purpose... 
{25056}{25118}but he would not have|left it lightly.
{25120}{25182}The Latin inscription translates as:
{25198}{25262}"In the name of God,|open this door."
{25287}{25330}{y:i}There is an insignia. 
{25429}{25489}{y:i}Yes, it matches your ring. 
{25514}{25617}I think that in Transylvania|you may find the answer you seek.

{26100}{26169}You killed him, didn't you?|That's why they get so annoyed.
{26172}{26250}When they ask you to bring someone|back, they don't mean as a corpse.

{26827}{26879}Why can't I have one of those?
{26881}{26942}You've never gone after vampires|before now, have you?
{26944}{27000}Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,|they're all the same.
{27003}{27035}VAN HELSING: Best when cooked well.
{27037}{27063}No, they're not all the same.
{27066}{27149}A vampire is nothing like a warlock.|My granny could kill a warlock.

{28207}{28244}Did you invent this?
{28246}{28290}I've been working on that|for 12 years.
{28292}{28338}It's compressed magma|from Mt. Vesuvius...
{28340}{28390}with pure alkaline|from the Gobi Desert.
{28392}{28442}- It's one of a kind.|- What's it for?

{28563}{28625}I didn't say that.|I said I didn't know what it's for.
{28628}{28685}What it does|is to create a light source...

{56922}{56979}- Carl, the tower. Start there.|- Right.
{56981}{57064}The only way to save your family is|to stay alive till Dracula's killed.
{57066}{57152}And who will kill him if not me?|Who will show courage if not me?

{92206}{92312}So would you like me|to refresh your memory a little?
{92342}{92412}A few details from your sordid past.
{92650}{92725}Perhaps that is a conversation|for another time.
{92770}{92865}Allow me to reintroduce myself.
{92881}{93000}I am Count Vladislaus Dragulia.
{93046}{93107}Born 1422.
{93134}{93220}Murdered 1462.
{93541}{93585}Help me!

{94523}{94607}[Suspenseful instrumental music]
{94742}{94804}I think|we've overstayed our welcome.
{95057}{95176}[Growls and snarls]
{95561}{95645}[Suspenseful instrumental music continues]
{95921}{95982}MAN #1: Have you found the children?|MAN #2: Not yet.
{96063}{96143}- What happened?|- They just died.
{96264}{96313}How can I ever repay you?
{96412}{96451}[Whispers]
{96493}{96555}But you can't do that.|You are a monk.
{96557}{96613}Well, actually I'm just a friar.
{96684}{96767}IGOR: I am sorry, master.|We try and we try...
{96769}{96877}but I fear we are not so smart|as Dr. Frankenstein.
{96893}{96921}Truly.
{96951}{97045}It would appear the good doctor|took the key to life to his grave.
{97172}{97209}Hunt them down.
{97271}{97309}Kill them both.
{97381}{97440}ANNA: A silver stake? A crucifix?
{97445}{97512}ANNA: What, did you think|we haven't tried everything before?
{97514}{97575}ANNA: We've shot him, stabbed him,|clubbed him...
{97577}{97643}sprayed him with holy water,|staked him through the heart...
{97645}{97688}and still he lives!|Do you understand?
{97692}{97737}No one knows how to kill Dracula.
{97739}{97825}Well, I could have used|that information a little earlier.
{97833}{97881}Don't give me that look.
{97987}{98056}You were right. I'm sorry.
{98075}{98127}He's not my brother anymore.
{98177}{98237}[Sentimental instrumental music]
{98482}{98546}Do you have any family,|Mr. Van Helsing?
{98588}{98649}Not sure.|I hope to find out someday.
{98651}{98702}That's what keeps me going.
{98737}{98824}- Here's to what keeps you going.|- Absinthe. Strong stuff.
{98924}{98990}Don't let it touch your tongue.|It'll knock you on your...
