1
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,827
As we pass
our New York City street,

2
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,797
please turn your attention
to the sidewalk up ahead.

3
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,266
Screen goddess Marilyn Monroe

4
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,868
made her very last
film appearance

5
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,338
standing on that spot.

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,573
Studio old-timers say

7
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,010
her spirit has been
seen there on occasion.

8
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,879
Well, let's see if she'll
put in an appearance

9
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,848
for us this morning.

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,686
Oh, well. I guess
she's too bashful.

11
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,639
How did I let you
talk me into this?

12
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,057
Oh, stop complaining.

13
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,727
Look, we got these free
VIP tickets from my agency,

14
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,164
and, well, at least I think
my agency sent them,

15
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,566
but anyway, baby,

16
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,068
didn't you want to ever do

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,303
all those silly Hollywood
things that tourists do,

18
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,439
like Wax Museum
or the Graveline Tour?

19
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:18,442
I did them when I first came to L.A.
in one day.

20
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:20,945
I can't believe we're
here without the kids.

21
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,114
How'd we get roped
into this anyhow?

22
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,283
I think it was that
architect's prize I won.

23
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,717
Remember that swag-bag
they gave us,

24
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,386
the ones with
the sunglasses you liked

25
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,387
that Alice broke?

26
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,821
I think
they were in there.

27
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:32,690
I'm just not in the mood.

28
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,625
Can we please
go back to the hotel?

29
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,626
Well, come on.

30
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,028
I hear the bus.
Let's go.

31
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,229
We can
still catch it.

32
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,898
Come on.
Get some speed on it.

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,899
Henry.

34
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,566
Just hurry up.
You can do it.

35
00:01:42,568 --> 00:01:43,768
My feet
are killing me.

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,203
Why did you wear
the stilettos?

37
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,204
All aboard.

38
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,238
Watch your head.

39
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:55,346
Uh, conductor, is it okay
if we take pictures?

40
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,916
Please go ahead.
We encourage it.

41
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,317
Oh, no, no, no.
Not of me.

42
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,087
Nobody wants
to take my picture.

43
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,530
Ah. Thank you.

44
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,502
Hey, I know that guy.

45
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,270
Yeah?
Yeah.

46
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,739
I met with him
when I first came out here.

47
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,175
He worked in a bunch
of freaky little B pictures

48
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,959
back in the '60s.

49
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:27,628
Nobody's hired him
in years.

50
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,629
Really?

51
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,051
All aboard.

52
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,121
Wait!

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,296
All set. And away we go.

54
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:47,966
Ladies and gentlemen,

55
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,985
welcome to the magic
and the mystery

56
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:52,487
of Ultra Studios,

57
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,022
where movie dreams
are born,

58
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:59,527
bloom, blossom,
wither, and die away.

59
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:16,560
Through this fence,

60
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:19,897
why, you can see the most
infamous set on the lot.

61
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,018
The legendary
House of Horrors

62
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,620
<i>from Desmond Hacker's
Hysteria.</i>

63
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,756
Um, can we go inside?

64
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:31,842
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, it's not safe inside.

65
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,562
We only open it
for special occasions.

66
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:36,163
Well, we're special,
aren't we?

67
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:38,632
I mean, this is
the VIP tour, right?

68
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:41,135
Says VIP on the tickets.
All access.

69
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,136
Mm-hmm.

70
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,304
Well,
I don't know.

71
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,638
It's against
studio rules.

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,890
Oh, come on.

73
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,358
Oh, please.
We won't tell anybody.

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,425
Come on.

75
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:50,394
Well, if you're all sure.

76
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,779
Absolutely.

77
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:52,780
Yes.

78
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:58,586
Okay. Max, open it up.
Let them in.

79
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,521
I tried to warn them.

80
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,098
<i>Hysteria!</i>

81
00:04:22,076 --> 00:04:23,410
Can we go inside?

82
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:25,679
Yes, yes.
You can all come in.

83
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,947
Ah.

84
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:29,233
Watch your step, please.

85
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,868
Looks like somebody's
been sitting here

86
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,036
a little too long.

87
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,470
Look at this guy.

88
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,675
Raah!

89
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:48,685
It's a shame they don't
take better care of this place.

90
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,439
Yeah. That's
typical Hollywood.

91
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:53,374
No respect
for its own past.

92
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,008
Hey, can we
go upstairs?

93
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,077
Oh, feel free
to walk around,

94
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,179
but don't touch
anything.

95
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:02,483
Some of Hacker's effects
may still be working.

96
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:03,551
Okay.

97
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:10,507
Hmm.

98
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,365
<i>Present.</i>

99
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,901
Did you hear that?

100
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,936
No, I didn't
hear anything.

101
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,738
It came
from up there.

102
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:55,987
Andy, be careful.

103
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,495
Huh.

104
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,431
Nothing there.

105
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,233
Yeah, whatever.

106
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:16,039
Are you here alone?

107
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,142
No. I'm with my husband.

108
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:20,878
That's a shame.

109
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,646
Because I'm here alone,

110
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,483
and I thought
if you were, too,

111
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,050
we might hook up.

112
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,253
Excuse me. We haven't
been introduced.

113
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:31,254
Leo.

114
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:32,255
Julia.

115
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:34,792
Hmm. Your husband's
a very lucky man

116
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,110
to have
such a beautiful wife.

117
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:40,281
I've always loved
tall women myself.

118
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,299
They're such a challenge.

119
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:46,170
You work
at the Egyptian Theater

120
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,704
on Hollywood Boulevard,
right?

121
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,073
Yeah.

122
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,841
I book the films there.

123
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,593
I thought
you looked familiar.

124
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:56,547
I'm Andy.
I'm a screenwriter.

125
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,116
I loved the Mario Bava
series you put on.

126
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,687
<i>Black Sunday,
Blood and Black Lace,</i>

127
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,156
all that weird Italian
Gothic stuff.

128
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:22,873
I wonder
what happened to him.

129
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:27,344
<i>I mean Desmond Hacker,
the guy who made Hysteria.</i>

130
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,714
No one would work
with him after a while.

131
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,517
There were rumors
of orgies

132
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,420
and satanic rituals
at night on his sets.

133
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,306
He made millions
for this studio,

134
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:42,276
and then one day,
they just barred him from the lot.

135
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:45,796
After that,
he disappeared.

136
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,748
Maybe this is him.

137
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:55,656
Whatever.

138
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:05,533
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

139
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:06,901
Let's try this one.

140
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:14,875
Aah!

141
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:18,846
Are you okay?

142
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,648
Phoebe, honey,
there you are.

143
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,882
Where were you guys?

144
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,083
We were back there.

145
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,619
Found this crazy room
with decapitated heads.

146
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:26,854
It was really cool.

147
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,256
So how do we get back
to the main entrance?

148
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,624
We don't know.

149
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,693
We all came in through
different directions,

150
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,495
thinking that
was the way out.

151
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,535
Okay, Mr. Tour Guide,

152
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:43,471
this has been a lot of fun
and everything,

153
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,639
but can you get us
out of here now?

154
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:48,041
Uh, I don't know
that I can.

155
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:49,243
You sure as hell
can, buddy.

156
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,661
Come on.
You got a passkey,

157
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,829
a walkie-talkie,
something.

158
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,697
Stop it. You're
just scaring him.

159
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,901
Now please. Just think.

160
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,687
Which of these doors leads
to the front of the house?

161
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:05,042
Well, it-- it's not
as simple as that.

162
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,179
<i>Do you remember
the plot of Hysteria?</i>

163
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,947
All the characters
gather in one room

164
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:14,735
to tell horror stories
to each other?

165
00:09:14,737 --> 00:09:17,437
Well, this is that room.

166
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,808
Uh--

167
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:28,999
Desmond Hacker had it built
on a rotating platform.

168
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,001
Once his actors were inside,

169
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,738
they couldn't get out
until he released them.

170
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:41,812
I think someone's
trapped us in here.

171
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,647
Honey,
where's your phone?

172
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,781
Damn it,
where's my phone?

173
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,384
Shit. Here it is,
here it is, here it is.

174
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,920
Listen, I suffer
from severe claustrophobia,

175
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,323
so if this is a joke
or interactive whatever--

176
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,590
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

177
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:55,759
You're in for one hell
of a lawsuit, mister.

178
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,994
I promise you that.

179
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,030
Enough of this shit.
We're getting out of here!

180
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,800
No! Don't, don't, don't!
That's studio property.

181
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:04,968
Fuck this studio!

182
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,270
You were supposed to take us

183
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,371
on a crummy 45-minute tour,

184
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,290
not suffocate us
in some torture dungeon!

185
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:15,029
Shit.

186
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,464
This is the door we came in!

187
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,036
There's got to be a way.
There's got to be a way.

188
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:38,218
Oh, what the fuck!

189
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:40,787
Wow.

190
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,558
That was quite a trick.

191
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,960
I warned you
before you came in.

192
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:50,631
All the effects
in this house are real.

193
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,534
Then why did you
bring us in here?

194
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,285
Well,
I tried to warn you,

195
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,321
but you all wanted
to come inside,

196
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,323
see the famous
spooky house.

197
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,275
Oh, so scary.

198
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,210
Look, I think we should
just calm down.

199
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:04,761
I mean, they'll realize
we're missing.

200
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,563
The  tram bus
is parked outside.

201
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,166
Somebody will come spot it
and come looking for us.

202
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,101
She's right,
isn't she?

203
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,837
Yes, it's, uh, possible.

204
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,072
What do you mean
it's possible?

205
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:18,342
Well, it could
take them a while

206
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,245
to figure out we're inside.

207
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,464
And the studio closes
in a few hours.

208
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:29,302
Oh. It could be tomorrow
before they find us.

209
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,973
Maybe there's another way out.

210
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:35,759
How?

211
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,144
<i>You remember in Hysteria,</i>

212
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:40,948
the mad undertaker
forces everyone

213
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,851
to tell horror stories
to each other.

214
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,786
Well...

215
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:50,040
maybe that's what
someone wants us to do.

216
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,312
Reenact the movie,
in essence.

217
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,214
You think
someone's watching us,

218
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,966
like they saw us
come in here?

219
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:01,602
It's possible.

220
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,002
Oh, stop saying that.

221
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:04,371
"It's possible,
it's possible."

222
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:06,806
You don't have a clue
what's going on here.

223
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,492
Why do you hate me so?

224
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,228
I-- I'm a victim here
just like you are.

225
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,697
Look, I mean,
why don't we just try it?

226
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,683
We can't break our way out.

227
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:19,920
She's right. Let's just
tell some scary stories

228
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,521
and see what happens.

229
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,123
Oh. Oh, no.

230
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,092
They-- They can't
be just any stories.

231
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:28,829
They have to be
personal, true stories.

232
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,815
Desmond Hacker forced his cast

233
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:37,271
to tell their own
most horrifying memories.

234
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:41,892
All right. Who is
going to go first?

235
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:52,403
I will.

236
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:55,805
I'm an actress, so I
don't mind the spotlight.

237
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,207
Phoebe.

238
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,276
Honey, I don't think
that's a good idea.

239
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,661
No, it's--
it's all right.

240
00:13:00,663 --> 00:13:02,729
Um, actually, I've had

241
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,699
some pretty terrifying
experiences recently,

242
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,100
and-- You know what?

243
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:10,070
Maybe it's good
to talk about them.

244
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:11,371
Baby.

245
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:15,709
When I first came out here,

246
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,644
they said I was
a Heather Graham type,

247
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,312
and I thought,
well, that was good.

248
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:20,981
I mean, she was cute
and likable,

249
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:23,567
I wanted to be
cute and likable, too.

250
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,502
After all, Heather Graham
couldn't get

251
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,688
all the Heather Graham
parts out there.

252
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:30,123
At some point

253
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,508
I stopped being
Heather Graham,

254
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,677
and I started being
a Sarah Michelle Gellar type.

255
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,012
Then I was Alicia Silverstone.

256
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,181
Oh, and then Mena Suvari.

257
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,020
Thanks.

258
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,523
Uh, yeah. No.
I'm right by the--

259
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,824
Are you ready?
Yes.

260
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,025
Excellent. Come on in.

261
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,026
Yeah.

262
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:51,661
Uh, excuse me.
Yeah.

263
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:54,298
I was wondering if I was
going to be seen soon.

264
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,299
What's your name?

265
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,968
Phoebe. Phoebe Kane.

266
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,169
I thought you knew me.

267
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,837
I've been coming
in here for years.

268
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,038
Yeah. Uh,
I'm really sorry.

269
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,707
You should never
have been called in.

270
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,375
This part's for a 22-
to 24-year-old.

271
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,311
I can play that.
I'm 22 to 24.

272
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,747
Uh, ha, I'm sorry,
honey, okay? Thanks.

273
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,616
Yeah. No.
Go on in now.

274
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:24,911
God.

275
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:33,687
Are my eyebrows too thick?

276
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:43,380
Is my nose too big?

277
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:52,656
Do I need collagen?

278
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:19,749
That's why they
look better than me.

279
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:34,297
Hmm.

280
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,068
Hmm.

281
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:03,177
I'm so glad you didn't fall

282
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,930
for all that "Plastic surgery
is bad for you" crap, Ms. Kane.

283
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,800
Really, it's nice
to meet a young woman

284
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,235
who can think for herself,

285
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:15,239
who can weed out
the media-controlled hype.

286
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,691
Thank you, Dr. Weissman.
I actu--

287
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:19,042
Oh. Dr. Larry.

288
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,913
My-- My patients
call me Dr. Larry.

289
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:27,184
Oh. Um, I've heard there
are some risks involved

290
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,618
in breast enhancement.

291
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,922
Well, in the early years...

292
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,460
out of every 10,000
plastic boobs,

293
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,263
there would be one or two...

294
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,448
bad apples in the barrel,
medically speaking.

295
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,666
Oh!

296
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:45,835
God.

297
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:53,593
But we've learned
from our mistakes.

298
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,762
Silicone is bad.

299
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,931
Gel implants are bad.

300
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,817
I wouldn't put those
things in my body,

301
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,654
and I won't
put them in yours.

302
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:07,791
Um, then how do you
make my breasts bigger?

303
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,075
Here.

304
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:12,279
With these.

305
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,737
These are made from
reprocessed human tissue

306
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,139
from cadavers.

307
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,157
You mean from dead bodies?

308
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,610
Oh, I know it sounds gross,
but it's completely natural.

309
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,246
You have to think of it more
as an organ transplant.

310
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,848
I mean, most of them
are done from cadavers.

311
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,933
Oh, like in car accidents?

312
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:35,635
Exactly.

313
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,637
And I guarantee,

314
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,306
you will feel

315
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,507
that the breasts
have always been

316
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:44,044
a part
of who you really are.

317
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:48,881
So...

318
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:52,485
are you ready
for the new you, Phoebe?

319
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:05,932
You feeling all right, Phoebe?

320
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:08,568
You want
to go ahead with this?

321
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:12,355
Good girl.

322
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:16,659
Gas her.

323
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:22,599
Count backwards from 100.

324
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,817
100...

325
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,785
99...
99...

326
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:27,871
98...

327
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,889
97...

328
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,975
6...

329
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,960
5...

330
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:36,529
4...

331
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:38,698
3...

332
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,685
Huh. When's the next one?

333
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,020
20 minutes, Doctor.

334
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,521
Ah, jeez.

335
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:47,124
All right, let's go. Come on.

336
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:58,501
¶

337
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:07,009
Okey-dokey.

338
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,079
Implants ready,
Doctor.

339
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,768
All instruments
sterilized, Doctor.

340
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,095
Geronimo.

341
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,504
Nice.

342
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,239
Whoo-ee.

343
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:57,643
Ooh.

344
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,657
May I have a cigarette?

345
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,327
A double scotch.

346
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:20,700
Oh, Jesus Christ.

347
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:21,918
Sponge.

348
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:24,787
Pail.

349
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:29,993
Stitch her up.
Get her out of here.

350
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,360
Get the next one in.

351
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,601
I think I'm ready
for my close-up now,

352
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:56,436
Mr. Spielberg.

353
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:02,359
Ow.

354
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,343
What the hell?

355
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,378
Must be the goddamn ring.

356
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,869
<i>About a month
after Dr. Larry's surgery,</i>

357
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,504
<i>I got a call from my agent.</i>

358
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:17,257
<i>He was calling to say
I got cast in a film</i>

359
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,758
<i>based on a sci-fi
TV series.</i>

360
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,926
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

361
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:21,344
<i>I mean, they actually
wanted me</i>

362
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,596
<i>and not some other girl.</i>

363
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:26,866
Action.

364
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:31,571
Jesus. Five years

365
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:34,474
inside that hellhole
prison on Mars.

366
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:35,642
Ohh...

367
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:38,011
Staring at those
other two planets--

368
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:39,112
Ohh...

369
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,247
...dreaming about it,

370
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:41,448
what it would feel like.

371
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,749
Ohh...oh...

372
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:44,251
Aah!

373
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:45,985
Oh, my God.
Aah!

374
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:47,320
Cut.

375
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:49,623
Zack, what's happened, mate?

376
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,058
She fucking bit me!

377
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,160
Oh! I'm--

378
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:54,594
Christ, look,
I got a hickey!

379
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:56,863
It's big enough to have
its own area code.

380
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,965
Fuck!
I-- I guess I got too excited.

381
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,433
Are we going
to do it again?

382
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:05,939
You're a fucking wildcat,
girl.

383
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,291
Yeah!

384
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,476
Woo-woo-woo!

385
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:10,543
Phoebe, darling,

386
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:12,045
could you just
take it easy on him?

387
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:14,765
Yeah...yeah...yeah.

388
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:20,053
Oh...ohh!

389
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:21,354
Ahh...

390
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:23,757
Ahh.

391
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:26,876
Ohh...

392
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,836
Zack, can I talk to you
for a sec?

393
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:39,255
It's nothing heavy.
It's just...

394
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:45,412
I can't believe how my life
has turned around.

395
00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:51,618
I mean,
I'm actually working now.

396
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:55,021
I bought new furniture
for my apartment

397
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:56,455
for the first time.

398
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:03,897
I've even got a sex life.

399
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:08,868
I know this sounds stupid,

400
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,023
but...it's all
because of my boobs.

401
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:18,494
Did you hear me?

402
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:19,963
Zack?

403
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:49,075
Look at the size of them.

404
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:52,044
I wasn't making this up.

405
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,780
They hurt like hell.

406
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:55,582
I know, baby.
I got your message,

407
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,484
but listen,
it's all taken care of

408
00:23:57,486 --> 00:24:00,320
because I got bug spray.

409
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:02,322
Rose-scented,

410
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:04,924
and ta-da!

411
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,610
Look at the bed, baby.

412
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,128
Tropical
mosquito netting.

413
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,899
Mm...Oh, yeah.

414
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,623
Uhnn! Uhnn!

415
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,991
Oh!

416
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:25,094
What are you doing?
Oh, my--

417
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,815
Aah!
Aah!

418
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,817
No! Oh!

419
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,323
You're not going
to cut it off!

420
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:38,458
Ohh! No!

421
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,694
No! No! No!

422
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,285
You okay?
Stay away from me.

423
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,203
What?
What have you got,

424
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,871
some kind of freaky
fucking nipple ring?

425
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:54,007
No! I don't know
what happened!

426
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,760
Oh, my God, I'm
as scared as you are.

427
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,128
I'm fucking out of here.

428
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,779
What?

429
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:06,469
Zack, please don't go.

430
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,272
Oh, my gosh.

431
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,940
What is going on?

432
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,410
What is going on?
What is going on?

433
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:19,699
Oh, my God.

434
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:34,581
Dr. Larry, open up!
I need to talk to you now!

435
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:36,882
Oh, excuse me.

436
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:38,718
Do you know where
Dr. Weissman is?

437
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,885
No, honey, I'm sorry.

438
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:41,487
He hasn't been in
for over a month.

439
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:43,089
A month?

440
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:44,773
There's been some other
girls looking for him.

441
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:45,941
Are you okay, honey?

442
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:48,244
No. I need to find him!

443
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,113
I have a medical emergency!

444
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,281
Don't you have any idea
where he could be?

445
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:54,850
Well, you could try the
research facility in San Pedro.

446
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:57,586
It's 11270 Wharf Front Drive.

447
00:25:57,588 --> 00:25:59,088
Wait. But--

448
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,459
Oh, yeah, wait--
1127, 1127, 1127.

449
00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:14,670
Can I speak
to Dr. Lucy, please?

450
00:26:52,976 --> 00:26:54,009
Ohh...

451
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,867
Oh...my...

452
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,306
Dr. Larry.

453
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:25,742
Aah!

454
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:30,947
What are you doing
in there, Miss Kane?

455
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,266
You'll catch
your death of cold.

456
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:34,717
Who are you?

457
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,619
How do you know my name?

458
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,621
I'm Dr. Lucy,

459
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,856
and these are my colleagues:

460
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:43,259
Dr. Judith...

461
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,627
and Dr. Charlotte.

462
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:48,631
Are you going to kill me?

463
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,950
Kill you? Heh heh.

464
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,252
Whatever gave you that idea?

465
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,539
Because you killed
Dr. Larry.

466
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,774
His body's hanging up there.

467
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:01,978
He made the unfortunate
decision

468
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,963
to operate on himself,

469
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:07,567
and when he contracted
gangrene,

470
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:13,322
he asked...that his body be
used for scientific purposes.

471
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,709
I'm afraid
you'll be his last

472
00:28:16,711 --> 00:28:19,412
but finest creation,
Miss Kane.

473
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:21,530
You know what he did to me?

474
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,166
My breasts, they--

475
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,051
Feed on human blood.

476
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:26,736
Yes, we know.

477
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:30,106
We designed them that way.

478
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,008
I don't understand.

479
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,492
Why would you do this?

480
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:35,761
We are men of science.

481
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:37,697
We've spent our lives

482
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:40,365
trying to find ways
to extend human existence.

483
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:43,603
I mean, why should
people grow old?

484
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:46,305
You could say
that we've been looking

485
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,907
for the Fountain of Youth.

486
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:51,360
We developed
an artificial breast,

487
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:55,331
but rather than
producing milk...

488
00:28:55,333 --> 00:29:00,152
these breasts will
feed off human blood,

489
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:03,623
thus restoring
vital energy to the body.

490
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,958
Haven't you noticed

491
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,628
how much younger and sexier
you've been looking?

492
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,966
Yes, but I thought it was
just my new breasts.

493
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:16,118
It's a new you, Miss Kane.

494
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,354
But I don't want
a new me.

495
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,955
I want the old me back

496
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:22,225
without these bloodsucking
tits you gave me!

497
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,743
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:25,811
I thought you understood.

499
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:30,432
The operation
is, uh, permanent.

500
00:29:30,434 --> 00:29:33,303
You mean I'm stuck
with these...things

501
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,737
for the rest of my life?

502
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:39,125
We all are, Miss Kane.

503
00:30:00,513 --> 00:30:01,547
Whew.

504
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:03,582
Mmm.

505
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:10,440
Oh, man.

506
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,658
That's a fucked-up story.

507
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,495
Excuse me for saying.

508
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:20,216
I have to ask, though,

509
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,251
do they...hurt?

510
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,753
Your--
Your breasts, I mean.

511
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:27,022
Are they...hungry?

512
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:29,258
Why are you all
looking at me

513
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,009
like I'm some
kind of a freak?

514
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:35,097
I'm not. I didn't ask
for this to happen to me.

515
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,767
Uh, Mr. whatever your name is--

516
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,602
It's Andy.

517
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,555
Andy,
you're her boyfriend.

518
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:46,792
Have you ever seen these
vampire tits of hers?

519
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:48,076
No, she won't show me
her breasts.

520
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:49,379
Andy.

521
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:52,948
Even when we're having sex,
she keeps them covered up.

522
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,250
Well, it's the truth.

523
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,451
I mean, I just figured

524
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,288
it was part of your
fucked-up whatever.

525
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,506
I don't know
what I thought.

526
00:31:01,508 --> 00:31:03,375
No, no, no, no.
Just admit it.

527
00:31:03,377 --> 00:31:04,810
You wanted some pussy,

528
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:07,212
and you'd believe any
bullshit she told you.

529
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:08,497
Honey--

530
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:14,170
Maybe we should just
move on, huh?

531
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,706
Who would like to share
their story next?

532
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,508
This is insane.

533
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,677
We should be
shouting for help

534
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,412
or banging on the walls
or something.

535
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:24,013
You want to bang
on the walls?

536
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,465
Go ahead.

537
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,152
Oh, great.
So we just sit here?

538
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,121
If you're so impatient,

539
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,323
why don't you
just tell your story?

540
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:37,026
You know,
I don't think so.

541
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,360
I-- No offense.

542
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:41,530
I am not in a sharing
mood tonight.

543
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,498
All right.

544
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:47,169
I'll tell them.

545
00:31:52,092 --> 00:31:53,793
We were in Japan.

546
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:56,429
I'd dreamed of going
there for years,

547
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:58,297
and finally
the opportunity came up

548
00:31:58,299 --> 00:31:59,798
to go to an architect''
conference there,

549
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,136
and I thought if I--
if I brought Julia

550
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,370
that maybe we could...

551
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:09,775
...put a little fire
back in our marriage.

552
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:13,212
I could see
how unhappy she was.

553
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:15,615
She'd given up her own career
when we had kids,

554
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:17,282
and it seemed
like a good chance

555
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:19,685
to get away,
just the two of us.

556
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:42,341
He says all he want
to do now

557
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:45,845
is go fishing
and drink beer every day.

558
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:49,649
The last time
he was in New York,

559
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,583
we had to order him
a six-pack of Guinness

560
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:52,485
for every meeting.

561
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:53,569
You're funny.

562
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,006
Excuse me, gentlemen.

563
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:00,459
May I please borrow
my husband for a minute?

564
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:01,877
Please.

565
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,400
You said something about
just the two of us,

566
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:10,136
idyllic
Japanese holiday,

567
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,637
X-rated sex.

568
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:12,805
At my last count,

569
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:14,606
it's us, 40 guys
in business suits,

570
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:15,908
and no X-rated nothing.

571
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,576
I know,
but some of these men

572
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,511
are plugged into some
of the most lucrative

573
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:21,180
building contracts
in the Pacific Rim.

574
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:23,749
I've got your Pacific
rim right here.

575
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:28,287
Well, this could
get embarrassing.

576
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,789
Okay, you do
what you need to do.

577
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:28,397
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.

578
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,165
Do you speak English?

579
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:33,336
Uh,

580
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:36,806
my husband Henry
is in the other room.

581
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,141
He's the man
in the Ken Iwasaki suit.

582
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,844
Uh, Ken Iwasaki
is a Japanese designer.

583
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,714
Do you know his work?

584
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:47,550
Anyway, I helped Henry
pick out the suit

585
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,218
at Barney's in New York.

586
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,221
Do you know you can just bring
your dog into that store?

587
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,056
It's amazing. All these
expensive clothes,

588
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,592
and you can just bring
your big, hairy dog

589
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,094
right into the store.

590
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,530
God, what am I saying?
I'm babbling.

591
00:35:02,966 --> 00:35:04,132
Um--

592
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:06,969
Oh. Forgive me.
I haven't introduced myself.

593
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:09,739
My name is Julia.

594
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,173
Julia.

595
00:35:14,143 --> 00:35:15,544
Julia.

596
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,013
Yes. Exactly.

597
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:21,617
Seishin.

598
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,369
Seishin.
That's your name?

599
00:35:30,493 --> 00:35:33,129
Well, um, I should go.

600
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,631
My-- My husband's going to
wonder what's happened to me.

601
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:00,522
<i>Jigoku.</i>

602
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:04,059
<i>Jigoku.</i>

603
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:51,656
Julia.

604
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:58,197
<i>Julia.</i>

605
00:37:01,901 --> 00:37:04,770
Julia? Are you there?

606
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:06,205
Yes.

607
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:07,372
I'm up here.

608
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,474
Just checking.

609
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,999
Ahh.

610
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,236
Oh, look.

611
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:29,044
Oh, God.
Look at that.

612
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:33,749
<i>Jigoku.</i>

613
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,950
What did you say?

614
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,720
<i>Jigoku.</i>

615
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,106
What's that?

616
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:41,290
Just a word
I picked up.

617
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:56,956
I can't run
in these shoes.

618
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:58,156
You can run in them.

619
00:37:58,158 --> 00:37:59,157
My God.

620
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,359
I've seen you run before

621
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,794
when there's a sale
at Barney's.

622
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,397
I'm coming.

623
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:38,280
<i>Julia.</i>

624
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,247
<i>Julia.</i>

625
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,384
<i>Julia.</i>

626
00:39:01,404 --> 00:39:02,521
Oh!

627
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,357
Oh!

628
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,481
There's a man back there
at the temple,

629
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:13,898
and he's hanged himself.

630
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,517
The cemetery by the temple.

631
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,990
She doesn't understand
a fucking word we're saying.

632
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:22,574
Can you tell her?
I'm trying, Julia.

633
00:39:22,576 --> 00:39:24,860
There's only a few phrases
of Japanese in my guidebook.

634
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,028
None of them happen to be

635
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,413
"I just found a dead guy
at the temple."

636
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:30,048
Um, look.

637
00:39:31,401 --> 00:39:33,034
I'm going to draw it.

638
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:36,705
There. Do you understand?

639
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,441
Dead. Man dead.

640
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,727
Man? Dead?

641
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:42,911
Yes.

642
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,026
I am very sorry
that you had to see this

643
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,245
on your visit
to our temple.

644
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:02,948
Please, who was he?

645
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,453
He lived and studied here.

646
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:10,206
He was a member
of our order.

647
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,973
I can't tell you
much more than that.

648
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:41,573
Julia.

649
00:42:45,611 --> 00:42:46,711
Henry?

650
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:50,716
What is it?

651
00:42:53,986 --> 00:42:56,488
Nothing. I just
had a bad nightmare.

652
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,823
Mmm.

653
00:42:59,258 --> 00:43:00,526
It's okay.

654
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:16,278
<i>Julia.</i>

655
00:45:41,437 --> 00:45:42,804
Julia?

656
00:46:00,606 --> 00:46:02,207
Julia!

657
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:04,376
Hi.
Have you seen my wife?

658
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,484
You, uh, my wife.

659
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:14,051
She'll be back.

660
00:46:14,053 --> 00:46:15,186
Don't worry.

661
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:16,488
Great. Thanks.

662
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:21,092
Have you seen this woman
anywhere? My wife.

663
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:23,778
Have you seen her anywhere?

664
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,113
No, you haven't seen her?

665
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,998
I just want to see
if my wife left a message.

666
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,937
Julia, where are you?

667
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:39,144
Hi. Is the, uh, head--
head monk-- is he in?

668
00:46:39,146 --> 00:46:40,445
Shoes.

669
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:41,513
Oh.

670
00:46:48,037 --> 00:46:49,203
Hello.

671
00:47:22,571 --> 00:47:24,089
My wife
and I were here.

672
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,258
We found the dead man
up in the cemetery,

673
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,425
and now
she's disappeared,

674
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,594
and I can't find her.

675
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:33,231
I remember her.
Very beautiful.

676
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:35,867
I will pray
for her safe return.

677
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:40,205
All right, well, then,
can you tell me

678
00:47:40,207 --> 00:47:42,256
what this means?

679
00:47:42,258 --> 00:47:44,759
Where did you get this?

680
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,094
My wife drew it.

681
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:49,464
I'm sorry, but this is
a matter for the police.

682
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,683
I'll be happy
to speak to them for you.

683
00:47:51,685 --> 00:47:53,251
I want you
to speak to me.

684
00:47:55,654 --> 00:47:58,256
Do you believe in hell?

685
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:02,177
These are the chambers
of Seishin,

686
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,579
the monk
who hang himself,

687
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,015
the one you found.

688
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:12,820
<i>Jigoku.</i>

689
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:14,356
<i>Jigoku?</i>

690
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,225
These pictures
show the road to hell.

691
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:28,420
I'm afraid this is where
he's taken your wife.

692
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:35,559
You said
you love your wife.

693
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:36,961
How much?

694
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,398
How much?

695
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,034
She means everything to me.

696
00:48:43,036 --> 00:48:44,686
I can't live without her.

697
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,288
Go back to the cemetery

698
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,557
where you found the man
hanging.

699
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,225
There's a cave entrance
nearby.

700
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:56,130
You must go inside.

701
00:48:57,516 --> 00:48:59,017
You must get her

702
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,853
to take this prayer
and swallow it.

703
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,021
Swallow it?

704
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,957
Hurry. The longer
she remains in there,

705
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:07,292
the less chance

706
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:10,244
that either of you
will come out alive.

707
00:49:21,023 --> 00:49:22,157
Julia?

708
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:25,577
Julia, are you in there?

709
00:49:30,649 --> 00:49:32,951
Henry, where are you?

710
00:49:32,953 --> 00:49:34,368
Julia?

711
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:37,238
Henry.

712
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:42,710
<i>Julia.</i>

713
00:49:44,429 --> 00:49:47,782
Oh, stop, Henry.
Please, stop.

714
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:06,167
I'm lost.

715
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,952
I'm lost.

716
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:10,721
I'm lost.

717
00:50:10,723 --> 00:50:12,790
Lost.

718
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:14,509
Julia!

719
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:20,782
You can't stop me.

720
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,151
Julia!

721
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:05,610
<i>I'm lost.</i>

722
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:14,869
Swa--

723
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,154
Swallow.
Eat this.

724
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:20,792
Julia. Julia.

725
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:22,060
Eat this.

726
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:11,359
I can't believe you told our intimate
family details to these strangers.

727
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,562
Look, you've been under a lot of
strain these last few months.

728
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,564
I was sexually molested
by a dead monk

729
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:17,231
and dragged into the mouth
of Buddhist hell.

730
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:19,333
I'd call that more
than a fucking strain.

731
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:21,803
I think we should all
just calm down a little bit.

732
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,006
- What if we can't get out?
- I want to go home...

733
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:27,392
What if whoever's out there
won't let us go?

734
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:30,195
Are you kidding?

735
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:33,931
This whole thing is
a crock of shit.

736
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:37,218
Probably half the people
here are in on the gag.

737
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,553
What are you guys
talking about?

738
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,622
Nothing.

739
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,906
Can I have a cookie?

740
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,140
No.

741
00:52:48,247 --> 00:52:51,232
Perhaps you'd like
to tell your story then.

742
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:55,954
Me?

743
00:53:02,394 --> 00:53:03,794
I have only one

744
00:53:03,796 --> 00:53:05,729
scary story to tell.

745
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:10,935
It's about the best friend
I ever had.

746
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,288
He was a great director.

747
00:53:15,374 --> 00:53:17,208
Maybe the greatest.

748
00:53:19,211 --> 00:53:21,078
His name was...

749
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,280
Stanley.

750
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:30,504
Leo Herschel.

751
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:34,308
You know, I--

752
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,778
<i>I saw The Strangler,</i>

753
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,314
and I thought it had
a wonderful setup.

754
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,366
I have to hand it to anyone

755
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:42,751
who can make a--

756
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:44,953
a psychotic killer
out of Bobby Driscoll.

757
00:53:47,756 --> 00:53:49,290
What's your name?

758
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:51,275
I'm Stanley.
Nice to meet you.

759
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:54,562
<i>He'd seen a low-budget
thriller I'd written.</i>

760
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,398
<i>It was about a teenager who
pretended to crash his bicycle</i>

761
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,600
<i>so older women
would take pity on him</i>

762
00:53:59,602 --> 00:54:02,003
<i>and let him
into their homes.</i>

763
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,338
<i>Then he strangled them.</i>

764
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,675
<i>Most people thought
it was sick and depraved,</i>

765
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:10,328
<i>but Stanley thought
it was a work of genius.</i>

766
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:15,966
<i>Turns out we had
a lot in common.</i>

767
00:54:15,968 --> 00:54:17,435
<i>Both our fathers
were doctors...</i>

768
00:54:18,438 --> 00:54:21,139
<i>...we both loved jazz,</i>

769
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:22,640
<i>and, of course,
we both came to Hollywood</i>

770
00:54:22,642 --> 00:54:24,225
<i>to make movies.</i>

771
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:27,561
<i>I'd seen Stanley's films.</i>

772
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:29,363
<i>The first two were good,</i>

773
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:32,066
<i>but the one at the race
track was brilliant.</i>

774
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:35,169
<i>People were already
talking about him</i>

775
00:54:35,171 --> 00:54:36,738
<i>as the next Orson Welles.</i>

776
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,955
Hold on a second.

777
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:39,574
<i>I knew he was a genius.</i>

778
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,859
<i>And then I found out
that he played chess.</i>

779
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,862
<i>¶</i>

780
00:54:51,336 --> 00:54:53,004
There was a girl
I had the hots for

781
00:54:53,006 --> 00:54:55,039
back in New York.

782
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,657
A real brainy type.

783
00:54:58,594 --> 00:54:59,761
She dragged me
to a screening

784
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,764
at the Museum
of Modern Art.

785
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,567
I was just hoping to get
some pussy, you know?

786
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:07,651
My idea of cinema was
anything with Alan Ladd.

787
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:11,171
Then the lights went down

788
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:12,640
and the movie started.

789
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:17,127
It was a French film
by a guy I'd never heard of,

790
00:55:17,129 --> 00:55:18,546
Jean Vigo.

791
00:55:20,783 --> 00:55:23,451
And within five minutes,
the world changed forever.

792
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:29,157
The shot of a young woman

793
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,441
in her wedding dress

794
00:55:30,443 --> 00:55:31,626
walking along the barge.

795
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:36,881
I'd never seen anything
so unbelievably beautiful.

796
00:55:39,485 --> 00:55:41,051
I was at
that screening, too.

797
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:56,151
<i>I don't know how long
we played that first time.</i>

798
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:59,337
<i>- We talked about everything</i>-

799
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:00,904
<i>movies, women,</i>

800
00:56:00,906 --> 00:56:03,241
<i>18th century literature
and warfare,</i>

801
00:56:03,243 --> 00:56:04,942
<i>Dr. Joseph Goebbels,</i>

802
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,977
<i>the Irish Republican Army.</i>

803
00:56:06,979 --> 00:56:09,229
<i>Stanley knew everything
about everything.</i>

804
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:14,234
<i>After that, we started to
play chess together twice,</i>

805
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:16,570
<i>sometimes three times a week at his house.
Check.</i>

806
00:56:27,816 --> 00:56:29,350
Hey, Stanley!

807
00:56:33,856 --> 00:56:35,890
Sorry I'm late, buddy.

808
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,325
Traffic was hell coming
over the hill from Ultra.

809
00:56:41,363 --> 00:56:43,230
Hi, I'm Nina.

810
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:45,049
You must be Leo.

811
00:56:45,051 --> 00:56:47,068
Stanley said
you'd be coming over.

812
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,770
What'd you bring us?

813
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:53,074
I have been starving
all day.

814
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,160
It's like an oven in here.

815
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,079
Stanley!

816
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,514
If you're such
a famous director,

817
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,716
why don't you have
air conditioning?

818
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,585
Sweltering heat's
good for you.

819
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,353
It opens your pores,

820
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,788
frees the inhibitions.

821
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,091
If my inhibitions were any freer--

822
00:57:15,864 --> 00:57:17,198
<i>For some reason,</i>

823
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,416
<i>I never thought of Stanley
as a ladies man.</i>

824
00:57:19,418 --> 00:57:21,102
<i>Yet there he was,</i>

825
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,287
<i>kissing one of the most
incredible women</i>

826
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:25,556
<i>I had ever seen.</i>

827
00:57:25,558 --> 00:57:27,859
<i>He never said
where he met her...</i>

828
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,527
<i>and I never asked him.</i>

829
00:57:31,897 --> 00:57:33,965
<i>¶
I have a 90-page script.</i>

830
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:36,066
They want me to cut
another seven pages.

831
00:57:37,936 --> 00:57:40,204
It'll end up being a
trailer and not a feature.

832
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:45,543
Thank you.

833
00:57:50,415 --> 00:57:51,782
This obsession
with length

834
00:57:51,784 --> 00:57:54,151
is killing creativity
in American movies.

835
00:57:57,255 --> 00:57:58,956
I have a secret
idea, though.

836
00:58:02,528 --> 00:58:05,796
I wanna make a film...

837
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:07,765
that's 24 hours long.

838
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:09,734
One entire day
of celluloid.

839
00:58:11,403 --> 00:58:12,503
Hmm.

840
00:58:14,573 --> 00:58:15,806
I don't know.

841
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:17,041
You mean you follow
somebody around

842
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:19,076
with a camera
for a whole day,

843
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,545
shoot them while
they're peeing,

844
00:58:20,547 --> 00:58:22,813
sleeping, fucking?

845
00:58:26,217 --> 00:58:27,317
No, that's, uh--

846
00:58:27,319 --> 00:58:30,087
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

847
00:58:33,425 --> 00:58:34,926
I'm not sure that

848
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,327
simply turning
a camera on

849
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:38,963
some daily,

850
00:58:38,965 --> 00:58:40,598
mundane behavior

851
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,300
is necessarily
worthwhile cinema.

852
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:45,603
I disagree.

853
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,872
I think Leo's idea
is kind of brilliant.

854
00:58:49,374 --> 00:58:51,842
Imagine if you filmed
someone dreaming--

855
00:58:51,844 --> 00:58:54,329
really dreaming--
instead of just pretending.

856
00:58:55,897 --> 00:58:58,165
You could actually capture
the essence of their dreams

857
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,201
on film....

858
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,002
like a firefly in a bottle.

859
00:59:03,472 --> 00:59:04,939
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

860
00:59:07,643 --> 00:59:09,410
Yeah, we could try
it out on you.

861
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:12,996
But I don't sleep, Stanley.
You know that.

862
00:59:12,998 --> 00:59:14,799
I just take little catnaps.

863
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,935
Well, that's impossible.
Everyone has to sleep.

864
00:59:17,937 --> 00:59:20,204
Not me.

865
00:59:20,206 --> 00:59:22,440
I'm a dedicated insomniac.

866
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:25,993
Why don't you
sleep over sometime

867
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:27,327
and see for yourself?
What?

868
00:59:29,347 --> 00:59:30,498
You mean like a--

869
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,849
<i>Ménage à trois?</i>

870
00:59:33,435 --> 00:59:35,386
Come on, you're a man
of the world.

871
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:37,421
Real lady-killer.

872
00:59:38,924 --> 00:59:40,625
You must know
about these things.

873
00:59:40,627 --> 00:59:42,126
Nina.

874
00:59:42,128 --> 00:59:43,444
What are you doing?

875
00:59:44,913 --> 00:59:46,280
Look at poor Leo.

876
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,582
He doesn't--

877
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,916
He doesn't know that
you're teasing him.

878
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,184
Come here. Come here.

879
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,652
I have to keep
an eye on you.

880
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:13,424
You sure you wanna
make that move?

881
01:00:26,204 --> 01:00:29,507
<i>I should have known then
that something was wrong.</i>

882
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:32,843
<i>Stanley never made a sloppy
chess move in his life.</i>

883
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:43,954
<i>¶</i>

884
01:00:43,956 --> 01:00:46,473
<i>After that, I didn't hear
from Stanley</i>

885
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:48,192
<i>for almost a month.</i>

886
01:00:48,194 --> 01:00:50,995
<i>Troubling rumors started
to go around...</i>

887
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:52,729
<i>that he turned in
a half-assed draft</i>

888
01:00:52,731 --> 01:00:55,166
<i>of a script to Dore Schary,</i>

889
01:00:55,168 --> 01:00:57,635
<i>that he wasn't
returning phone calls.</i>

890
01:00:57,637 --> 01:00:58,786
<i>It seemed like</i>

891
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,804
<i>he wasn't even leaving
his house anymore.</i>

892
01:01:17,022 --> 01:01:18,989
<i>¶</i>

893
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:20,157
Stanley!

894
01:01:21,426 --> 01:01:22,392
Stanley's not here...

895
01:01:24,662 --> 01:01:26,663
but you're more than welcome
to hang out.

896
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,867
He's not here?

897
01:01:29,869 --> 01:01:32,203
He called and told me
to meet him this afternoon.

898
01:01:32,205 --> 01:01:34,338
I'm sorry.
He had to fly to New York

899
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,607
to meet on some
World War I project.

900
01:01:38,226 --> 01:01:40,394
Well, that's just weird.

901
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:41,963
I don't see him
for a month,

902
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,897
then he asks me to come
over and disappears.

903
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,568
Uh, I guess
I should take off.

904
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,437
No.

905
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,923
Please stay.

906
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,341
We can have our own party.

907
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,610
You could teach me
how to play chess.

908
01:01:59,214 --> 01:02:00,214
You're kidding me.

909
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,785
You're with Stanley and you
don't know how to play chess?

910
01:02:08,122 --> 01:02:09,756
We miss seeing you.

911
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:14,128
Stanley said you were
too busy to come over.

912
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,646
Well, that's odd.

913
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,698
I thought you guys
were too busy to see me.

914
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,633
Well, to tell the truth,
we barely left the apartment.

915
01:02:22,187 --> 01:02:23,854
I was pretty surprised
when Stanley told me

916
01:02:23,856 --> 01:02:25,222
he was going
out of town.

917
01:02:27,959 --> 01:02:30,177
You know, this is the first
time we've been alone together.

918
01:02:33,832 --> 01:02:35,816
I was just thinking
the same thing myself.

919
01:02:43,207 --> 01:02:46,027
So, tell me, teacher...

920
01:02:48,764 --> 01:02:50,898
what is the most
important rule

921
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,567
about playing chess?

922
01:02:55,637 --> 01:02:57,638
Well...

923
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:04,311
I guess it's to...

924
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,513
trust your gut instincts.

925
01:03:09,718 --> 01:03:11,752
But also...

926
01:03:14,422 --> 01:03:16,624
to control your emotions.

927
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,926
Well, that sounds like
a contradiction in terms.

928
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,463
I suppose it is.

929
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,349
The winner is the one

930
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:28,369
to make
the next-to-last mistake.

931
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:29,419
Hmm.

932
01:03:32,223 --> 01:03:33,423
You go first.

933
01:03:46,187 --> 01:03:47,370
I give up.

934
01:05:07,785 --> 01:05:09,987
Mmm...

935
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:20,931
<i>I didn't care that Stanley
was my best friend.</i>

936
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,034
<i>I didn't care
that it was his house,</i>

937
01:05:24,036 --> 01:05:25,236
<i>his bed...</i>

938
01:05:25,238 --> 01:05:27,471
<i>his girlfriend.</i>

939
01:05:27,473 --> 01:05:29,072
<i>I just wanted to fuck her</i>

940
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:33,210
<i>more than I'd wanted
anything in my life.</i>

941
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:34,811
<i>And I knew</i>

942
01:05:34,813 --> 01:05:36,247
<i>nothing could ever,</i>

943
01:05:36,249 --> 01:05:39,283
<i>ever come between us.</i>

944
01:05:44,606 --> 01:05:47,941
<i>¶</i>

945
01:06:27,582 --> 01:06:30,334
<i>I lost track of the days.</i>

946
01:06:30,336 --> 01:06:32,753
<i>At first I told
the studio I was sick.</i>

947
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:35,538
<i>Then I said
I had family problems.</i>

948
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:39,009
<i>Finally, I stopped
making up lies...</i>

949
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:41,211
<i>and told them they could
rewrite my movie</i>

950
01:06:41,213 --> 01:06:42,746
<i>any way they wanted.</i>

951
01:06:44,515 --> 01:06:46,483
It's from Stanley.
You wanna read it?

952
01:06:46,485 --> 01:06:47,684
No.

953
01:06:47,686 --> 01:06:49,719
He says
the movie's going well.

954
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:52,923
He thinks Adolphe Menjou
is a commie-hating psychopath,

955
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,858
which makes him
just right for the role.

956
01:06:56,928 --> 01:06:58,962
He doesn't mention
anything about us.

957
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,216
Why should he?

958
01:07:03,218 --> 01:07:04,218
Because I wrote to him

959
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,869
and told him
we were sleeping together.

960
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:08,155
What?

961
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,856
Are you crazy?
Why would you tell him that?

962
01:07:09,858 --> 01:07:12,159
Because it's the truth.

963
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:15,662
Stanley's never lied to me, and I
don't intend to start lying to him.

964
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:18,665
I can't believe you'd just
blurt that out to him.

965
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:22,419
"The weather's fine and, oh,
by the way, I'm fucking Leo"?

966
01:07:25,757 --> 01:07:27,724
He's gonna hate my guts.

967
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:29,927
Well, if he does,
he doesn't mention it here.

968
01:07:29,929 --> 01:07:32,262
He just says
once the movie's finished,

969
01:07:32,264 --> 01:07:34,297
he's planning
on staying in Europe

970
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:35,298
permanently.

971
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:28,101
<i>At some point, Nina vanished.</i>

972
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:29,753
<i>I don't know when she left.</i>

973
01:08:29,755 --> 01:08:33,691
<i>I just know that
one day she was gone.</i>

974
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,393
<i>I realized that I didn't
know anything about her.</i>

975
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:39,496
<i>My only contact
with her was Stanley,</i>

976
01:08:39,498 --> 01:08:42,065
<i>and he was in Germany
never to return.</i>

977
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:46,437
<i>I knew then that
I'd lost them both...</i>

978
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:48,071
<i>forever.</i>

979
01:08:55,213 --> 01:08:56,730
<i>Somehow I managed
to pull it together</i>

980
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,299
<i>and write
a few more movies.</i>

981
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,433
<i>People called them</i>

982
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:04,138
<i>minor classics
of anguish and despair.</i>

983
01:09:05,507 --> 01:09:06,807
<i>They don't know
the half of it.</i>

984
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,028
<i>But I know I never
forgot about Nina...</i>

985
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,213
<i>or Stanley.</i>

986
01:09:20,104 --> 01:09:22,373
<i>I hadn't spoken to Stanley</i>

987
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,941
<i>in almost 45 years,</i>

988
01:09:24,943 --> 01:09:27,611
<i>but I still felt like
I had lost my best friend.</i>

989
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:31,982
<i>I was almost as shocked
when I got a phone call</i>

990
01:09:31,984 --> 01:09:33,633
<i>from someone at the studio</i>

991
01:09:33,635 --> 01:09:35,002
<i>a few weeks later.</i>

992
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,837
He left very
specific instructions

993
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:38,938
that you and only you

994
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:41,642
should be shown this
after his death.

995
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,977
He also left this for you.
Oh.

996
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,379
Projectionist
will start the reel

997
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:46,880
and return
when it's finished.

998
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:02,062
<i>¶</i>

999
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:04,765
<i>This is my inner sanctum.</i>

1000
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,636
<i>I spent much of the last
40 years in these rooms.</i>

1001
01:10:11,539 --> 01:10:14,941
<i>Some people said
I was hiding from the world.</i>

1002
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:18,812
<i>It wasn't the world
I was hiding from.</i>

1003
01:10:21,015 --> 01:10:24,851
<i>There's only two things
I regret in my life.</i>

1004
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,620
<i>One is Napoleon.</i>

1005
01:10:27,622 --> 01:10:29,455
<i>I realize now that
I'll never live</i>

1006
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:31,424
<i>to make my movie
of his life.</i>

1007
01:10:34,128 --> 01:10:36,997
<i>The other thing
I regret is you.</i>

1008
01:10:38,933 --> 01:10:42,269
<i>There's no excuse for doing
what I did to you, my friend.</i>

1009
01:10:44,472 --> 01:10:47,274
<i>You probably thought
that you betrayed me</i>

1010
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:50,710
<i>by sleeping with Nina.</i>

1011
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:54,431
<i>But that's exactly
what I wanted you to do.</i>

1012
01:10:54,433 --> 01:10:55,999
<i>Somehow...</i>

1013
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,570
<i>I knew my life was in
terrible danger with her.</i>

1014
01:11:00,972 --> 01:11:02,439
<i>At first, I--</i>

1015
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:04,074
<i>I thought it was...</i>

1016
01:11:04,076 --> 01:11:06,309
<i>just a bad case of love</i>

1017
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:08,211
<i>or lust.</i>

1018
01:11:08,213 --> 01:11:11,949
<i>But when I let you win
that day at chess,</i>

1019
01:11:11,951 --> 01:11:13,817
<i>I knew something
was terribly wrong.</i>

1020
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:15,936
Yes. I knew it, too.

1021
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,522
<i>I had to get away.</i>

1022
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,990
<i>An idea came to me.</i>

1023
01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:25,161
<i>I knew that if I left
you alone with her,</i>

1024
01:11:25,163 --> 01:11:28,565
<i>she might turn
her attentions to you.</i>

1025
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,200
<i>So...</i>

1026
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:32,502
<i>I lured you
to my apartment that--</i>

1027
01:11:32,504 --> 01:11:33,853
<i>that afternoon,</i>

1028
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,340
<i>and then I left town.</i>

1029
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,644
<i>It was a few years later</i>

1030
01:11:40,646 --> 01:11:44,681
<i>that I started noticing
these images.</i>

1031
01:11:46,618 --> 01:11:48,885
<i>The subject was a witch</i>

1032
01:11:48,887 --> 01:11:52,372
<i>who was accused of drinking
the blood of her lovers,</i>

1033
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,775
<i>so that she could gain
immortality.</i>

1034
01:11:56,277 --> 01:11:59,028
<i>It couldn't possibly be her.</i>

1035
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:03,683
<i>But then-- then I found
the final piece of evidence.</i>

1036
01:12:07,154 --> 01:12:08,488
<i>These--</i>

1037
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:11,425
<i>These reels
of nitrate film were</i>

1038
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:14,528
<i>in the national archive
in Prague.</i>

1039
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,831
<i>They think it was shot
in what is now Czechoslovakia</i>

1040
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,098
<i>before 1900.</i>

1041
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:23,202
<i>These are the only copies
in existence.</i>

1042
01:12:26,407 --> 01:12:27,974
<i>You are the only person alive</i>

1043
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:29,876
<i>who might understand.</i>

1044
01:12:31,646 --> 01:12:33,580
<i>I hope you can forgive me.</i>

1045
01:13:45,803 --> 01:13:47,203
<i>Stanley...</i>

1046
01:13:50,108 --> 01:13:51,675
<i>Stanley...</i>

1047
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:02,051
What is it
with you, huh?

1048
01:14:02,053 --> 01:14:03,887
You can't just say,
"I'm a total pig.

1049
01:14:03,889 --> 01:14:05,956
I fucked
my best friend's girl"?

1050
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:08,224
You've got to invent
some totally insane story

1051
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:09,993
to justify the fact
that you can't keep

1052
01:14:09,995 --> 01:14:12,228
your dick in your pants?

1053
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:14,948
I take back
what I said before.

1054
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,651
Your husband
isn't a lucky man.

1055
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,920
He's fucking cursed!

1056
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,306
What was in the box, Leo?

1057
01:14:22,308 --> 01:14:24,791
The roll of nitrate film.

1058
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,626
Only it was completely
disintegrated,

1059
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,161
or I could have
shown it to you

1060
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:30,230
and proved what I said.

1061
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,232
We don't need proof
that you're a pig.

1062
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:33,800
You just shut up.

1063
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,068
Hey, hey, hey.
Shut up.

1064
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,269
Whoa, whoa.

1065
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,604
Cool it.

1066
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,840
Don't you all see
what's happening?

1067
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:42,209
It's just like the movie.

1068
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:49,282
He's right.

1069
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,750
We're starting
to attack each other.

1070
01:14:52,836 --> 01:14:55,289
Pretty soon we'll be
killing each other.

1071
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:56,573
Okay.

1072
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:58,408
Everybody's gotta unwind.

1073
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,710
Just sit down and chill out,

1074
01:15:00,712 --> 01:15:03,129
or we're not gonna
make it out of here.

1075
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:07,567
Well, I guess I'll tell
my story then.

1076
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:12,389
But I'm warning you,
it's pretty grotesque.

1077
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:13,640
As opposed to what?

1078
01:15:15,693 --> 01:15:17,494
It's about my twin.

1079
01:15:21,882 --> 01:15:23,883
<i>My father's name
is Vincent.</i>

1080
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:25,952
<i>He was born in France,
just like my mother.</i>

1081
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:32,526
<i>They both moved
to the U.S. in 1972</i>

1082
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,761
<i>when my mom's family
bought a vineyard here.</i>

1083
01:15:43,621 --> 01:15:46,189
<i>Martine was my mother.</i>

1084
01:15:46,191 --> 01:15:48,058
<i>She grew up
in a very big family</i>

1085
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,609
<i>where everyone had ten kids.</i>

1086
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,651
Thanks. Very nice.

1087
01:15:57,653 --> 01:16:00,854
<i>He was the most beautiful man
she ever met.</i>

1088
01:16:01,972 --> 01:16:03,373
<i>I think a lot
of other women</i>

1089
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:05,241
<i>said the same thing
about him.</i>

1090
01:16:11,348 --> 01:16:12,883
<i>My mom was a tomboy.</i>

1091
01:16:12,885 --> 01:16:14,418
<i>When she was a kid,</i>

1092
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,570
<i>she got expelled from school
three or four times.</i>

1093
01:16:17,438 --> 01:16:18,588
Ooh.

1094
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:20,007
<i>My grandparents said to her,</i>

1095
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:21,491
<i>"You're like a wild vine.</i>

1096
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:22,726
<i>Why don't you grow straight?"</i>

1097
01:16:39,593 --> 01:16:41,394
Maybe I work harder

1098
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:42,896
if you don't put so many
beautiful things

1099
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,463
in my way, huh?

1100
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:50,003
Very good.
Very good, indeed.

1101
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,404
It doesn't seem right.

1102
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:53,707
All this work,
and look how quickly it goes.

1103
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,309
Oh, yes, if you guzzle it
like cheap beer.

1104
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,396
Try sipping it,

1105
01:16:59,398 --> 01:17:02,682
and you won't drink
all the profits.

1106
01:17:07,521 --> 01:17:10,056
If we live long enough to
see the profits, you mean.

1107
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,191
Oh.

1108
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:12,993
What are we breaking
our backs here for

1109
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:15,862
when we had perfectly good
futures back in France?

1110
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:17,530
Who wants wine
from America anyhow?

1111
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:20,483
Maybe you should be thankful
for a minute, Vincent.

1112
01:17:20,485 --> 01:17:23,587
Look around.

1113
01:17:23,589 --> 01:17:26,439
These vines
that surround us all

1114
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,192
with beauty and--
and nourishment.

1115
01:17:29,194 --> 01:17:34,063
And someday they will make
you kids feel free.

1116
01:17:35,549 --> 01:17:37,701
Speaking of which,

1117
01:17:37,703 --> 01:17:41,288
when are we going to see
a grandchild, huh?

1118
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,655
Soon, we hope.

1119
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:45,625
We've pulled the goalie,
so we shall see.

1120
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:51,448
If we could only get a few
shots between the goal posts.

1121
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:04,361
The wine is gone.

1122
01:18:04,363 --> 01:18:06,062
I'll get another bottle.

1123
01:19:15,365 --> 01:19:17,533
<i>Dr. Bender
to the mental ward...</i>

1124
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:22,322
The tests confirm it.
You're pregnant.

1125
01:19:24,325 --> 01:19:27,527
That is a relief.

1126
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:30,096
Vincent will be very happy.

1127
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,765
Yes, but, um...

1128
01:19:32,767 --> 01:19:34,133
I don't know
how to say this.

1129
01:19:36,737 --> 01:19:38,771
What-- What is wrong?

1130
01:19:38,773 --> 01:19:41,874
You have something else
inside you.

1131
01:19:41,876 --> 01:19:43,976
A parasite, I'm afraid.

1132
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:45,345
<i>Taenia solium.</i>

1133
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:48,314
It's a tapeworm
in your intestine.

1134
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:50,516
You must have gotten it
from eating undercooked meat.

1135
01:19:51,568 --> 01:19:53,503
What is it doing there?

1136
01:19:53,505 --> 01:19:56,422
We have to get rid of it
before it hurts the baby.

1137
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:57,824
Well, that's the problem.

1138
01:19:57,826 --> 01:20:00,142
The only way to treat it
is with massive doses of iron.

1139
01:20:00,144 --> 01:20:03,496
And in most cases, the treatment
causes pregnant women to miscarry.

1140
01:20:04,882 --> 01:20:07,434
I do not understand you.

1141
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:09,201
You are saying I have to--

1142
01:20:09,203 --> 01:20:11,738
You have to let
the worm grow...

1143
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,422
with your baby.

1144
01:20:13,424 --> 01:20:14,540
It's the only way.

1145
01:20:30,273 --> 01:20:32,691
<i>So we began life together,</i>

1146
01:20:32,693 --> 01:20:34,677
<i>the worm and me.</i>

1147
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:37,580
<i>We were both dependent
on my mom for food,</i>

1148
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:38,898
<i>warmth,</i>

1149
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,865
<i>our survival.</i>

1150
01:20:41,568 --> 01:20:44,170
<i>She carried both of us
in her belly.</i>

1151
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:33,903
This smells good.
Mm-hmm.

1152
01:21:35,806 --> 01:21:36,906
Delicious.

1153
01:21:39,243 --> 01:21:40,176
Mmm...

1154
01:21:43,447 --> 01:21:45,181
I hate to ask,
'cause it's so awful,

1155
01:21:45,183 --> 01:21:46,833
but I can't help it.

1156
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:50,353
Go on.
You are my best friend.

1157
01:21:50,355 --> 01:21:52,872
Can you feel it
inside of you?

1158
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:56,058
I mean, the worm?

1159
01:21:57,761 --> 01:22:00,413
I know there is something
in there with the baby,

1160
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,883
some alien thing.

1161
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:06,001
I don't feel it moving,
but I know it does.

1162
01:22:09,456 --> 01:22:11,957
I wish it were dead
and out of my body.

1163
01:22:14,678 --> 01:22:17,146
But I can't kill it
without harming my baby.

1164
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,285
<i>Ever since I can remember,</i>

1165
01:22:22,287 --> 01:22:24,086
<i>I always wanted more.</i>

1166
01:22:24,088 --> 01:22:25,688
<i>Like the little boy
in Oliver Twist</i>

1167
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,523
<i>with his bowl out.</i>

1168
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:29,391
<i>I know why
I was always hungry.</i>

1169
01:22:29,393 --> 01:22:31,377
<i>Because the worm
was eating all my food.</i>

1170
01:22:49,046 --> 01:22:51,513
Just go away.
I am not hungry.

1171
01:22:51,515 --> 01:22:53,850
Come on,
a few bites.

1172
01:22:53,852 --> 01:22:55,384
It is miracle food.

1173
01:22:55,386 --> 01:22:57,386
I made it myself,
so it is a miracle.

1174
01:23:00,691 --> 01:23:02,592
Just go away.

1175
01:23:02,594 --> 01:23:05,844
This is stupid. You are just hurting
the baby when you don't eat.

1176
01:23:08,098 --> 01:23:09,331
Are you deaf?

1177
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:11,133
I said go.

1178
01:23:11,135 --> 01:23:12,585
Why don't you go
have sex with one

1179
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:13,886
of my brother's
wife instead, huh?

1180
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:16,489
Bitch.

1181
01:23:20,393 --> 01:23:22,996
<i>My parents must have fought
a lot when I was inside.</i>

1182
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,648
<i>I said go.
Bitch.</i>

1183
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,984
<i>I wonder if it
affected the worm.</i>

1184
01:23:30,954 --> 01:23:34,990
<i>Yes, the worm was eating
all my food,</i>

1185
01:23:34,992 --> 01:23:37,443
<i>but we were also sharing
the same space.</i>

1186
01:23:37,445 --> 01:23:38,861
<i>If I suffered,</i>

1187
01:23:38,863 --> 01:23:40,630
<i>then he suffered, too.</i>

1188
01:23:40,632 --> 01:23:42,331
<i>Neither one of us
could escape.</i>

1189
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,501
<i>I guess--</i>

1190
01:23:45,503 --> 01:23:47,270
<i>No, I'm certain</i>

1191
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,871
<i>that after a while,</i>

1192
01:23:48,873 --> 01:23:50,739
<i>the worm became my friend.</i>

1193
01:23:53,477 --> 01:23:56,829
<i>But to my mom,
he was born from poison.</i>

1194
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:59,198
<i>He haunted her
day and night.</i>

1195
01:24:00,434 --> 01:24:03,603
<i>If only she could
have seen us then...</i>

1196
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:05,270
<i>side by side...</i>

1197
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,042
<i>she might have
loved him, too.</i>

1198
01:24:45,813 --> 01:24:46,946
<i>A parasite, I'm afraid.</i>

1199
01:24:49,367 --> 01:24:53,102
<i>I know there is
something in there with the baby.</i>

1200
01:24:53,104 --> 01:24:54,520
<i>You have to let
the worm grow...</i>

1201
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:57,073
<i>with the baby.
Baby?</i>

1202
01:25:24,685 --> 01:25:28,071
It's trying to kill
my baby!

1203
01:25:31,357 --> 01:25:34,343
Vincent!

1204
01:25:37,798 --> 01:25:40,532
<i>My father left
when I was two.</i>

1205
01:25:40,534 --> 01:25:42,702
<i>He ran off with my mother's
best friend Annie,</i>

1206
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,403
<i>if you can believe it.</i>

1207
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:47,941
<i>I became a tomboy,
just like my mother was.</i>

1208
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:49,409
<i>But she knew better
than to ask me</i>

1209
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:51,093
<i>if I would grow straight.</i>

1210
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,868
<i>In 1986,</i>

1211
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:01,220
<i>Mom fell apart.</i>

1212
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:04,257
<i>She had never
gotten over things.</i>

1213
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:07,643
<i>And when my father
married her friend Annie,</i>

1214
01:26:07,645 --> 01:26:10,646
<i>she slipped away forever.</i>

1215
01:26:10,648 --> 01:26:12,648
Jump inside.
Go.

1216
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:48,968
First her family fires you
from the vineyard,

1217
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:50,136
and now they blame you

1218
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:52,004
because their daughter
is a nut case?

1219
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:55,007
I swear to God,
sometimes I think

1220
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:57,376
that Martine is having
a nervous breakdown

1221
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,178
just to get back
at me.

1222
01:27:00,414 --> 01:27:02,581
Can I have some
pretzels, please?

1223
01:27:04,318 --> 01:27:06,018
Of course you can.
The bowl is right there.

1224
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,753
You don't have to ask.

1225
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:08,687
Vincent.

1226
01:27:10,623 --> 01:27:11,724
Vincent.

1227
01:27:27,691 --> 01:27:30,710
Natalie?
Open up.

1228
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:34,263
We do not lock our doors
in this house.

1229
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:42,838
What were you doing just now?

1230
01:27:45,826 --> 01:27:47,977
Why did you take
all of those pretzels?

1231
01:27:50,764 --> 01:27:53,082
I keep finding
these piles

1232
01:27:53,084 --> 01:27:55,484
of uneaten food
all over the house.

1233
01:27:57,337 --> 01:28:00,122
I had an eating problem, too,
when I was your age,

1234
01:28:00,124 --> 01:28:03,292
and it was really
awful for me

1235
01:28:03,294 --> 01:28:04,777
when I was in school.

1236
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:05,811
So maybe,

1237
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,964
if you wanna talk
about it,

1238
01:28:07,966 --> 01:28:10,315
then you won't have
to hide food.

1239
01:28:10,317 --> 01:28:11,967
Okay?

1240
01:28:16,773 --> 01:28:19,041
<i>Looking back,
I can't really blame her.</i>

1241
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:20,476
<i>My father never got
her pregnant,</i>

1242
01:28:20,478 --> 01:28:22,111
<i>so she was stuck
with me,</i>

1243
01:28:22,113 --> 01:28:24,480
<i>a stepdaughter
she did not want.</i>

1244
01:28:36,025 --> 01:28:39,529
<i>In any case,
I wouldn't stop stealing food.</i>

1245
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:41,847
<i>I needed it for me...</i>

1246
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:43,666
<i>and for my twin,</i>

1247
01:28:43,668 --> 01:28:46,168
<i>the worm.</i>

1248
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:47,520
<i>Wherever he was,</i>

1249
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:49,254
<i>I knew he must have
been hungry, too.</i>

1250
01:28:49,256 --> 01:28:52,458
<i>...problem, too, when I was your age.
I think you have a problem.</i>

1251
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,010
<i>Why are you hiding
all of this food?</i>

1252
01:28:57,648 --> 01:28:59,098
<i>It quickly became war.</i>

1253
01:29:07,174 --> 01:29:11,026
<i>At first she said she was putting
me on a diet for my own good.</i>

1254
01:29:11,028 --> 01:29:13,595
<i>But soon I realized
she was trying to starve me</i>

1255
01:29:13,597 --> 01:29:15,664
<i>for being
my mother's daughter.</i>

1256
01:29:18,434 --> 01:29:21,586
<i>Why are you hiding
all of this food?</i>

1257
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:25,190
Are you just gonna
let her kill me?

1258
01:29:32,466 --> 01:29:34,299
Well, are you?

1259
01:30:38,715 --> 01:30:40,182
It's hurting.

1260
01:30:47,407 --> 01:30:52,928
Oh, stop it!

1261
01:30:55,398 --> 01:30:57,566
Oh, God!
Stop it!

1262
01:30:57,568 --> 01:30:59,869
There's something inside her.

1263
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,436
My wife.

1264
01:31:01,438 --> 01:31:02,838
No, I am not killing
my wife.

1265
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,007
She's--
There's something--

1266
01:31:05,009 --> 01:31:08,177
Yes! I don't know what she ate!
Oh, my God!

1267
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:11,781
Please come quickly!

1268
01:31:25,462 --> 01:31:27,963
When they operated, they found
her intestines were riddled

1269
01:31:27,965 --> 01:31:29,832
with little,
bite-sized holes.

1270
01:31:31,335 --> 01:31:34,220
Is she...dead?

1271
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:35,287
No.

1272
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,228
But she's lost
all her taste for food.

1273
01:31:43,363 --> 01:31:45,097
She's an invalid now.

1274
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:47,599
Never leaves the apartment.

1275
01:31:47,601 --> 01:31:49,068
Strange thing is,

1276
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,403
my dad stayed
married to her.

1277
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:54,456
He's cared for her night and
day for the past 25 years.

1278
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:56,559
I bet he wishes
she had died.

1279
01:31:56,561 --> 01:31:59,078
Probably wish it
on each other.

1280
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,479
That's marriage.

1281
01:32:01,998 --> 01:32:04,633
Not our marriage,
of course.

1282
01:32:06,154 --> 01:32:08,354
Oh, bravo.

1283
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:10,856
Congratulations.

1284
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:15,093
Oh, you were
all magnificent.

1285
01:32:15,095 --> 01:32:17,163
Better than I could
ever have imagined.

1286
01:32:17,165 --> 01:32:19,247
What do you mean?
Oh.

1287
01:32:19,249 --> 01:32:23,218
Truly twisted and horrific.

1288
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:24,520
And the way

1289
01:32:24,522 --> 01:32:26,488
you each made yourself

1290
01:32:26,490 --> 01:32:30,476
the victim
of your own story,

1291
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:34,329
that was the most
horrifying thing of all.

1292
01:32:34,331 --> 01:32:40,085
I've never had
better performers.

1293
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:41,853
It's you.

1294
01:32:41,855 --> 01:32:43,755
You led us into
this torture chamber

1295
01:32:43,757 --> 01:32:45,790
so we'd each tell
our story

1296
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:47,076
for your amusement.

1297
01:32:47,078 --> 01:32:48,877
Oh, hold on.
Hold on.

1298
01:32:48,879 --> 01:32:50,646
Don't get so excited.

1299
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:54,917
If you hurt me,

1300
01:32:54,919 --> 01:32:56,685
you'll never hear

1301
01:32:56,687 --> 01:32:58,988
how it all turns out.

1302
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,240
Don't listen
to him.

1303
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:02,841
He's a lying
little freak.

1304
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,176
For once I agree
with you.

1305
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:05,844
I'm sick of hearing
this guy talk.

1306
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:07,479
Hold on.

1307
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:08,747
What's the end
of the story?

1308
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,216
Well...

1309
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:16,722
you each left out
the most important part.

1310
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:19,191
You, Phoebe.

1311
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:21,710
<i>Everything they say
about Hollywood</i>

1312
01:33:21,712 --> 01:33:24,146
<i>and your life changing
overnight</i>

1313
01:33:24,148 --> 01:33:27,333
<i>is totally
and completely true.</i>

1314
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:30,286
I really don't think
I like the way

1315
01:33:30,288 --> 01:33:33,321
they lit me
for this interview.

1316
01:33:33,323 --> 01:33:34,957
Sweetie,
what do you think?

1317
01:33:34,959 --> 01:33:38,510
<i>I think that Marilyn
is just a beautiful</i>

1318
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:39,978
<i>sex symbol, icon--</i>

1319
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:42,765
Pretty smile, though,
don't you think, sweetie?

1320
01:33:48,088 --> 01:33:50,222
At least I still
have you guys.

1321
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:54,960
My babies.

1322
01:33:56,996 --> 01:33:59,097
Oh, Andy,

1323
01:33:59,099 --> 01:34:00,799
as long as you
still love us,

1324
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,534
that's all that matters.

1325
01:34:06,441 --> 01:34:10,076
Are you guys ready
for a refill?

1326
01:34:10,078 --> 01:34:11,043
Okay.

1327
01:34:18,318 --> 01:34:19,918
Oh.

1328
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,137
There you go.

1329
01:34:22,139 --> 01:34:23,772
Much better now.

1330
01:34:26,009 --> 01:34:27,893
What's he talking about?

1331
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:30,228
Phoebe, honey?
I don't know.

1332
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:32,397
Andy, I would
never hurt you.

1333
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:34,533
I love you so much.
Come here.

1334
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:37,937
And you, Henry

1335
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:40,205
and Julia?

1336
01:34:44,327 --> 01:34:45,560
Hi.

1337
01:34:49,732 --> 01:34:51,099
I love you.

1338
01:35:04,213 --> 01:35:05,280
Oh...

1339
01:35:23,717 --> 01:35:26,084
No, that's not possible.

1340
01:35:26,086 --> 01:35:28,387
I brought her out of there.
We both made it out.

1341
01:35:31,391 --> 01:35:33,024
And you, Leo?

1342
01:36:21,508 --> 01:36:23,609
And you...

1343
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,544
sweet Natalie.

1344
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:29,064
This is sick.

1345
01:36:29,066 --> 01:36:30,632
Sounds like
a real psycho child.

1346
01:36:41,277 --> 01:36:43,979
What a piece of work.

1347
01:36:43,981 --> 01:36:45,630
She poisons
both her parents

1348
01:36:45,632 --> 01:36:47,232
and sits here
eating pudding.

1349
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:48,833
Let her eat.

1350
01:36:48,835 --> 01:36:50,318
She'll get the death
penalty for this.

1351
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:02,864
Fresh air.

1352
01:37:04,266 --> 01:37:08,102
It was getting
a little stuffy in here.

1353
01:37:09,656 --> 01:37:10,956
Let's go.

1354
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:13,291
I'm outta here.
Let's go. Come on.

1355
01:37:15,295 --> 01:37:16,262
Watch your step, Julia.

1356
01:37:18,798 --> 01:37:20,566
Where is he?
I don't see anything.

1357
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:21,667
Just keep moving.

1358
01:37:24,871 --> 01:37:25,937
Where is he?

1359
01:37:25,939 --> 01:37:27,005
Look, there's a door.

1360
01:37:34,296 --> 01:37:37,866
Oh, my God, Andy.
That's you.

1361
01:37:39,185 --> 01:37:40,301
<i>Nothing there.</i>

1362
01:37:44,874 --> 01:37:45,974
Jesus Christ.

1363
01:37:47,777 --> 01:37:49,711
We're never going
to get out of here.

1364
01:38:06,095 --> 01:38:07,913
Look at me.

1365
01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:09,848
I forgot my badge.

1366
01:38:19,308 --> 01:38:21,993
That soundstage
that we just passed

1367
01:38:21,995 --> 01:38:23,628
is said to be haunted

1368
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:25,530
by the spirit of...

1369
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:28,066
well-known screenwriter
Leo Herschel,

1370
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:31,770
who blew his brains out
in despair.

1371
01:38:31,772 --> 01:38:33,071
And if you look
to the left,

1372
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:35,574
well, you may catch
a glimpse

1373
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,977
of that lovely film actress
Phoebe Kane,

1374
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:41,145
who died
of lethal injection

1375
01:38:41,147 --> 01:38:42,947
after murdering
her boyfriend

1376
01:38:42,949 --> 01:38:45,533
and draining
his body of blood.

1377
01:38:45,535 --> 01:38:49,888
Oh, and let's not forget
Miss Anjou...

1378
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:52,091
who fed poisoned wine

1379
01:38:52,093 --> 01:38:55,160
to her father
and stepmother

1380
01:38:55,162 --> 01:38:56,595
and then slit her wrists...
