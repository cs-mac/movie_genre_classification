1
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:08,228
Hey, yo, JT. Man, what word
starts with "F" and ends with "U-C-K"?

2
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,395
Come on.

3
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,904
Firetruck, man.

4
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,067
What are you, 8?

5
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,103
Man it's too hot for this shit.

6
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,738
Fuckin' drills.

7
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,142
Hey, Bar go long. Come on.

8
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,933
What are you staring at?

9
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,310
Johnny.

10
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,581
Rickie, she's just a
waste of your time, man.

11
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,214
No, man.

12
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,246
She's not so bad.

13
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,054
Sorry. Here you go.

14
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,555
Hey, let's blow this. C'mon..

15
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,227
Nobody will notice.

16
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,292
Let's get outta here.

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,439
Alright.

18
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,642
Rickie's cuttin' class, man.
I can't hardly believe it.

19
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,406
Well, you better believe it now.

20
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:05,247
Shit, man, I just keep thinking all the
fun stuff you're missing, you know.

21
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:09,915
You're missing uh,
the fuckin', gay coach Hankens.

22
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:14,484
And fuckin' faggot gym showers and fuckin'

23
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,927
queer jock motherfuckers
fuckin' with you all day long.

24
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,761
You missed all those things.
I know you do.

25
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,632
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you miss that, right?

26
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,167
Joann Skinner.

27
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,265
Oh Rickie!

28
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,900
Rickie, Rickie, Rickie.

29
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,207
Come on, man! Let that shit go!

30
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,805
Come on, man, let it up!

31
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,405
Rickie!!!

32
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,085
Rickie you got to get
over that shit, man!

33
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,316
4th grade's a long time ago.

34
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,381
You lost Joann to puberty
and you ain't gettin' her back.

35
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,255
You should have fucked her when you were 9
when you had the chance, boy!

36
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,666
Look, man, what are we gonna do?

37
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,301
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

38
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,572
Quit you're whining.

39
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,944
Look, I brought some brews.

40
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,448
- Oh yeah.
- All right, but not right here.

41
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,847
Let's go to the nuthouse.
Whaddya say?

42
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,047
What, the nuthouse?

43
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,613
The nuthouse, man?

44
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,591
Why would you want to go there?

45
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,685
'Cause it's fuckin' hot out.

46
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,393
You've got a better idea?

47
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,261
I guess not, man.

48
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,568
JT, man, aren't there any
security guards there or something?

49
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,536
There's no fucking
security guards, man.

50
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,505
The place is dead.

51
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,632
The place is deader than dead.
Come on.

52
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,106
We always talked about goin' in there.
Lets do it.

53
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,400
The place is fucking huge.

54
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,675
Think of all the crazies that lived here.

55
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,874
You trying to scare me?

56
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,748
Oh, man. I'm just saying.

57
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,547
All the drugs they used to serve out here.

58
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:54,678
Shit.

59
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,188
Keep us floating for a lifetime.

60
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,351
- Hell yeah.
- Right!

61
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,067
Hey!

62
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,595
I think it's time for some warm beer.

63
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,206
Yeah!

64
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,691
Alright, Rick.

65
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,433
It's not as scary as
it looks on the outside, man.

66
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,935
Kind of like it here.

67
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,575
I bet you would,
fucking padded walls and all.

68
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,447
Fucking dick.

69
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,652
Well, it sure beats hangin' out
in that parking lot. That's for sure.

70
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,821
You want to see real scary though?

71
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,596
You gotta go down to the tunnel.

72
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,539
These tunnels, they go to all
the other buildings, that way

73
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,516
they wouldn't have to take the
real dangerous patients outside

74
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,144
to get them to a different cell or something.

75
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,086
They never went outside?

76
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,748
Not the murderers.

77
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,280
Or the real fucked-up ones.

78
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,626
They kept murderers in here man?

79
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,530
JT.

80
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,166
JT.

81
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,684
C'mon man, where'd you go?

82
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,391
What are you, 8?

83
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,665
Oh, come on.
You were scared just a little bit.

84
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,213
Quit fucking around, JT.

85
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,944
It didn't work a second ago
and it ain't working now.

86
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,281
JT.

87
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,613
I'm not doing anything.

88
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,355
What the hell is that?

89
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,064
Oh, shit.

90
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,663
I thought you said there
weren't any guard dogs.

91
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,573
That ain't no guard dog.

92
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,939
Run, run!!!

93
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,222
Holy shit!

94
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,025
Shit!

95
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:03,895
Man, I haven't been that scared since those
cop chased us down on the 4th of July.

96
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,667
Yeah, well I'd rather deal with
pissed-off pigs than pissed-off dogs.

97
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,042
Come on.

98
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,205
There's gotta be a way out of here.

99
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,444
There's got to be.

100
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,948
I think I see a door down here.

101
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,750
Man, it looks like a dead end.

102
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,449
Oh yeah. There's definitely
a door back here, Rickie.

103
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,627
Where do you think that goes?

104
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,597
I hope it goes out of here.

105
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,140
Darn it!

106
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,077
Come here and help me move this stuff.

107
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,813
It's locked JT. I -

108
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,526
That's not locked, just rusted shut.

109
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,657
Come here and help me, man.

110
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,044
Push.

111
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,919
Push boy.

112
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,323
Push harder, man.
Put your back into it.

113
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,211
JT, what the fuck is going on, man?

114
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,365
Hey.

115
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,568
What is it?

116
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,809
Holy shit!

117
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,317
JT, what the hell, man?
What's going on?

118
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,484
What is it?

119
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,988
Holy shit.

120
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,623
What?

121
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,361
You're never going to believe this, Ricky.

122
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,940
Holy shit, man.

123
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,103
Yeah, I told you.

124
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,640
What the fuck is she doing down here JT?

125
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:27,054
- She... you think she's fuckin -
- There's one way to find out.

126
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,066
Holy shit.

127
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,000
Holy shit, man.

128
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,559
What the fuck is she doing out here?

129
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,696
Oh my God.

130
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,002
She didn't just tie herself to that fucking bed.
Man, that's for sure.

131
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,938
Well, we better get out of here, man.

132
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,341
- We gotta -
- Sh-sh-sh.

133
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,935
We got to get the fuck out of here.

134
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,444
Just hold on a second, bro.

135
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,813
Hold on a second.

136
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,183
There's a fucking naked woman, man.
Lets go.

137
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,085
Oh shit.

138
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,118
We gotta get out of here JT!

139
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,716
Hold on a second.

140
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,819
All right.

141
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,228
Now, we had to pry
that door open, right?

142
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,459
You saw it yourself.

143
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,764
- Yeah.
- It was rusted shut, remember?

144
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,761
And we've been out here all day.

145
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,240
There ain't nobody here but us, right?

146
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,709
- Right?
- Alright. Good man.

147
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,202
Good. Now, let's free the fucking girl and
get the fuck out of here, man. Please.

148
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,454
No.

149
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,119
JT, cut it out!

150
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,990
Cut it out.

151
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:29,995
Hey!

152
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:40,065
JT, man, maybe some girl
has been missing, right?

153
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,666
I mean, there could be some kind
of reward or something, you know?

154
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,576
We could keep her.

155
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,284
What?

156
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,281
Keep her, man?

157
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,292
What?

158
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,551
JT, man. Keep her?

159
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,526
Just till tonight.

160
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,930
Tomorrow.

161
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,391
JT, keep her?

162
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:16,099
She's like someone in a magazine.

163
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,041
What are talking about man?
Let's go!

164
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,803
Look at her.

165
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,372
I can spend all day
looking at that body.

166
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,281
Jesus fucking Christ!

167
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,084
She is beautiful.

168
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,217
I mean... Jesus, JT, this is stupid, man.

169
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,454
We gotta free the girl and
get the fuck outta here. Please, man.

170
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,431
I'm begging you.

171
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:45,900
- What are you doing, man. Come on.
- Well, that's nice man.

172
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,803
You got come here and
you're going to feel that.

173
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,705
Come here and feel it.

174
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,266
Come here and feel that.

175
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,642
Come here just feel it man.

176
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,773
There's no way I'm gonna fucking...

177
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,215
Your loss.

178
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,684
JT cut it out man, seriously.

179
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,050
Just fuck off for me, man.

180
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:02,917
No, man.

181
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:03,853
What you're doing man?

182
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,391
What the fuck JT!

183
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,959
What the fuck has
gotten into you, man?

184
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,358
What the fuck's gotten into you, man?

185
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,008
Look, man. Look at that chick.

186
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,844
You're fucking sick, man.

187
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,013
You don't want any of this
just go and get out here.

188
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,989
You were never here,
as far as I'm concerned.

189
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,081
Go on.

190
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,963
Go on.

191
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,300
Just get out... get out of here.

192
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,411
Ma, you home?

193
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,563
- 911 what's your emergency?
- Damn, what happened to your face?

194
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,929
Where is my mom at?

195
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,370
Well, she picked up an extra shift today.

196
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,498
She said she'd be home
around midnight.

197
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,510
Yeah. Well, what are you doing here, Clint?

198
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,480
Your mom said it be all right,
if I stick around for a few weeks.

199
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,616
Man, I hope you gave as
good as you got, man.

200
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:21,024
You got to stand up to these bastards and give
it to them worse than they gave it to you, hmm?

201
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,620
In this world, you can't let
other people fight your battles for you.

202
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,757
It's called TCB, Rickie, huh?

203
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,233
Taking care of business.

204
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,863
That's great fucking advice, Clint.
I mean, thank you.

205
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:36,306
Especially coming from a fucking alcoholic
who can't even pay his fucking rent.

206
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,741
Hey, why don't you drink
some more of mom's beers

207
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,836
and then tell me about being real man, huh?

208
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,677
You know what Ricky?
Why the attitude, man?

209
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,943
I'm just trying to help you.

210
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,974
Well, gee whiz Clint, thank you.

211
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,820
You know what? It was your god damned mom's
idea for me to talk to you in the first place.

212
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,258
I know all the talking in the world
is not going to make you be a man.

213
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,784
You got to do it yourself.

214
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,363
Fucking kids.

215
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,213
Hope you're not seeing my
face when you pull that trigger.

216
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,056
Rickie!

217
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,794
Rickie man.
Come on, we've been friends too long.

218
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,164
Yeah, I thought we were
friends up until you punched me.

219
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,301
I'm sorry about that, all right?

220
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,365
And what about her, man.
You're sorry about that too?

221
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,674
That's why I came down here because
I need you to go back there with me, man.

222
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,748
No way, man.

223
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,377
Fucking forget it.

224
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,820
Rickie, please man.

225
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,222
Please, there's something you got to see.
It's real important, man.

226
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,123
It's really important.

227
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,059
If it's so important,
why don't you just tell me right here, JT.

228
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,325
Because you got to see it.

229
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,356
Man, you wouldn't believe me
if I just told you.

230
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,389
No.

231
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,628
No, JT.

232
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,832
I don't wanna be an accessory to whatever
sick shit you're doing, man.

233
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,397
Rickie, please.

234
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,432
You have to see this.

235
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,991
We're lettin' her go, JT, OK?
That's all there is to it, man.

236
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,797
And hopefully,
she doesn't send us to jail.

237
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,894
She's not going to send me to jail.

238
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,564
Why not?

239
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,541
I mean what did you do to her, JT?
What the fuck did you do to her, man?

240
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,067
Fuckin' killin' me...

241
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,245
Fuck, no way.

242
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,614
You can just tell me what you did to her, man.

243
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,422
She woke up.

244
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:22,799
She started to struggle,
of course, but she didn't scream.

245
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,776
No. She just sort of growled.

246
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:36,213
And tried to bite like a
wild fucking dog, you know.

247
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:41,556
So, uh, I hit her

248
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,027
just enough
to make her stop, you know.

249
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,155
Oh, man.

250
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,189
But she didn't.

251
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,666
She sure did not stop.

252
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,138
She just kept gnashing
at me with those teeth.

253
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:04,716
So, I hit her again and it felt good.

254
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,682
You wouldn't know about that.

255
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,756
Then I hit her harder.

256
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,456
- What the fuck did you do, man?
-And harder and harder.

257
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,589
JT.

258
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,657
Needless to say, after a while,
she stopped moving.

259
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,101
For Christ's sakes, man.
You fucking killed her.

260
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,297
You realize that man?

261
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:29,671
You fucking killed her and you bring me down
her and show me a fucking corpse, man?

262
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,433
Rickie!
You're a sick fuck, man.

263
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,376
I've had enough of your psycho shit.
We're taking her out of here now, JT.

264
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,539
- Hold on a sec!
- No, this has gone far enough.

265
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,309
You have to see
what I brought you here for.

266
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,477
I've seen more than enough, JT.

267
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,282
Rickie, no you haven't.

268
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,252
No.

269
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,689
What the fuck are you doing, JT?

270
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,283
- What the fuck are you doing, man!
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

271
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,521
No, man, no!

272
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,198
Rickie.

273
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,738
Rickie!

274
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,433
Man, get the fuck away from me, man.

275
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,964
No, no! It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

276
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,306
It's okay. It's all right.

277
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,605
Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy.

278
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,078
Take it easy, JT?

279
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,206
You fucking killed her, man.
You killed her with my fucking gun.

280
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,239
- Hold on a second man.
- You son of a bitch.

281
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,512
- You're a sick fuck, JT.
- Look!

282
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,883
- You sick fuck!
- Look!

283
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,978
Look!

284
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,690
It's a pretty active for a dead girl,
don't you think?

285
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,890
What the fuck!

286
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:34,070
I had to bring you down here, man.

287
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,470
Had to make you see her for yourself.

288
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,704
We got to get her to a fucking hospital
before she bleeds to death, JT.

289
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,904
She ain't gonna bleed to death, man.

290
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,114
You had to see it for yourself, Rickie.

291
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:55,916
Because I knew you wouldn't
believe if I just told you.

292
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,624
Jesus.

293
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,428
Tell me about it.

294
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,401
Because I thought I was going crazy.

295
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:11,402
I wasn't telling the complete truth earlier.

296
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:21,684
You see, I heard her neck crack.

297
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,210
I broke her fucking neck, man.

298
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,281
- I know that I did.
- No way.

299
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:30,055
Shit! I was trying to think what I was going
to do about it and she starts moving again!

300
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,663
I thought I was going crazy, man.

301
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,931
I stuck my thumbs real deep into her neck

302
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,334
until she quit moving.

303
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:48,369
A few minutes later,
she starts kicking again.

304
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:52,474
I killed her 3 times now.

305
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,485
Look at her.

306
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,055
This isn't real man.

307
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,524
This isn't real.

308
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,255
Oh, man. Is she on drugs?

309
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:07,254
I've never seen no drugs that will let you
take 3 bullets like nothing happened.

310
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:14,862
Where do you think she came from?

311
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,602
Maybe she was a patient here?

312
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,805
Maybe they did some mad scientist
experiment or some shit on her?

313
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,975
Who the fuck knows what they
did with the leftover people.

314
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:27,712
The hopeless ones...

315
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:32,212
Shit, man. She can't be killed.

316
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,784
I mean, it's fuckin' crazy.

317
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,385
It's fucking crazy.

318
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,531
It's awesome.

319
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,424
Man, she's so cold.

320
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,689
Well, she is naked.

321
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:20,137
So, what do we do with her JT?

322
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:25,199
I mean, we could leave her be, you
know, just forget about her, I guess.

323
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,879
Well, somebody else is bound
to find her, eventually, right?

324
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,615
We could destroy her.

325
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,591
Ain't you suppose to get her kind
in the brain pan or something.

326
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:43,253
JT, "her kind" man,
what the fuck are you saying?

327
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:52,464
Sure, she is some kind of monster
or something but she's our monster.

328
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,235
What you think?

329
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,873
About what?

330
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:07,544
About hot pussy?

331
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,110
Straight out of porn!

332
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,622
Anytime we want it, boy.

333
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,850
You and, and me.

334
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,984
I'm not fucking touching her man.

335
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,258
It's just asking for trouble JT,
okay, trouble I don't need, okay?

336
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:21,765
And you can't fucking be serious, man.

337
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,597
Come on.

338
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:28,038
Yeah, I think I am serious.

339
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,667
Come on, what else you want to do?
Take her home and introduce her to your mom?

340
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,735
What?

341
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,575
I got to think about this, JT. Okay?

342
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:44,784
Well, you take all the time you need 'cause,

343
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,688
she ain't going anywhere.

344
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,663
This is too fucking much, JT.

345
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,364
She's staying here with us.

346
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,073
Okay. Okay.

347
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,479
But this stays
between you and me, right?

348
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,481
Yeah.

349
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,982
I'm serious man.
This is our secret.

350
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:15,508
Me and you, JT and Rickie.

351
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:16,952
Hey you want to see something?

352
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,704
It's kind of fucked up, right?

353
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,743
Remember your oral
assignments are due this Friday.

354
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:56,218
Yo! Rickie, what's up?

355
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,889
Go home early yesterday, huh?

356
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,448
You feeling all right?

357
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,063
Mister talkative today, I guess.

358
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,831
What's up with you?

359
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,565
Sorry Wheeler, man. I'm just thinking.

360
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,271
Are you thinking about
Joann Skinner again?

361
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,938
You better watch it with
those eyeballs there, buddy.

362
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:32,346
- Have a good one, bro.
- I have to go.

363
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,449
- No!
- Yes!

364
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,812
Hey, Rickie.

365
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,647
Everything all right?

366
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,687
I'm just thinking.

367
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,352
The dead should stay dead.

368
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,295
So, you're thinking about reincarnation.

369
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,937
Some people believe
in life after death.

370
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,271
You're entitled to
whatever beliefs you like, Rickie.

371
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,474
I'd like to think that the
dead are happy where they are.

372
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:35,714
They wouldn't want to come back because
they earned it.

373
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,382
Far more glorious that all this.

374
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,086
Yeah.

375
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,253
Yeah, but what do you know, Mr. Harrison?

376
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,000
What's up?

377
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,806
Hey, Wheeler, man, what you doin' today?

378
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,745
You wanna go see if
Wes has got any weed?

379
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,838
No, man I can't.

380
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,746
I got plans.

381
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,410
What, a hot date?

382
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,420
Maybe.

383
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,887
Later, bro.

384
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,619
Alright later, Wheeler.

385
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,370
Ma, you home?

386
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,007
Fucking, Wheeler?

387
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,014
Rickie!

388
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,445
Hey Rickie.

389
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,851
JT, man...

390
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,380
Remember our fucking
conversation yesterday, man?

391
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:08,858
What's your problem, man?

392
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,420
My problem is we agreed not to
tell anybody about this, man.

393
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,564
- What are you fucking thinking?
- I know, we did.

394
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,295
I didn't want to be alone,
you know what I mean?

395
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,964
- I just want to have some company...
- I'm here, aren't I?

396
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,029
I mean I'm here.

397
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,339
Well, then go get some for once
instead of wishing that you could.

398
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,711
JT, come on.

399
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,846
It's not like that, okay?

400
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,480
Look.

401
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,360
Last night man, well...

402
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,063
Last night she uh...

403
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:54,331
Fuck... She been looking at you?

404
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,101
What?

405
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,698
Like she knows something.

406
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,677
What the fuck are you talking about, Rickie?

407
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,771
Look, we can make things easier.

408
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,942
We can call her Joann if you want.

409
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:10,977
But you know that ain't
a real human being, man, right?

410
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,388
You know that. It's all right.

411
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,686
It's okay.

412
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,420
That's besides the point, man.

413
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,725
Oh, is it?
Well, what are you doing down here, huh?

414
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,197
I don't know, man.

415
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,234
JT, man.

416
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:32,573
I'm not... that's not what...
god damn it, JT.

417
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,377
If you want, man, we can, like
flip her over. We haven't hit her backside yet.

418
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,840
No!

419
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,214
Rickie.

420
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,587
Pal.

421
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,718
What's wrong?

422
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,456
This whole thing is fucking over,
you guys, seriously.

423
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,226
We're all going to
get arrested or worse.

424
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,393
I mean, JT...

425
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,063
Look, how long have we known Wheeler?

426
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,538
All our lives?

427
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,801
He knows how to keep a secret.

428
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,207
He knows a good thing when he
sees it, don't you, Wheeler?

429
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,268
I know a good thing when I fuck it.

430
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,041
There you go.

431
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,811
So, you see
there's nothing to worry about, Rickie.

432
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,685
It's just you and me and
Wheeler and the dead girl.

433
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,486
She's not just some dead girl, man.

434
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,959
Well, I did kill her 3 times.

435
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,663
Go on. Give it a try.

436
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,466
Get on it, man.

437
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,837
Man, it's fuckin' sweet!

438
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,205
Fucking get in there, man.

439
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,834
Go on.

440
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,036
Go on!

441
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,607
Rickie! All right.
Well, come back in a couple of hours.

442
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,514
We'll be gone.

443
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:55,014
You can have nice private romantic time
and do lots of nice sensitive things.

444
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,289
Nice one.

445
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,795
God bless.

446
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,479
Look, I told you fuckers,
if you want weed, you need to--

447
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,789
I need some bolt cutters.

448
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,351
Got any money?

449
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,226
Come on, Wes.
You know I'm good for it, man.

450
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,328
Everything's going to be okay, alright?

451
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,304
I'll get you out of here.

452
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,639
I'm here to help you, okay?

453
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,609
Oh shit!

454
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,641
Do you understand me?

455
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,880
I'm going to get you out of here, okay?

456
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,648
You have to be quiet.

457
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,349
Okay.

458
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,788
You should be quiet.

459
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:31,573
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

460
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,636
Okay.

461
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,801
Did you leave the
fucking door open, Wheeler?

462
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,896
No, I don't think so.

463
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,305
I told you to keep that door shut, didn't I?

464
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,537
Why does it matter?

465
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,272
I want that dog messing with her.

466
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,540
Anybody humps her leg, it's me.

467
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:57,625
What's up, baby?
How are you doing?

468
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,960
Why don't you busy
yourself somewhere else.

469
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:03,228
Hey baby, you miss me?

470
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,180
Oh shit!

471
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,408
Oh fuck!

472
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,620
Oh fuck!

473
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,886
Grab her fucking hand, man!

474
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:30,683
Get her fucking hand.

475
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,559
Get the fuck down!

476
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,429
- Fuckin stop it!
- Fucking get her off!

477
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,894
Fucking, you ain't no help man!

478
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,110
She nearly fucking killed us, man!

479
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,710
- I oughta fucking bite you!
- How the fuck did she get free, man?

480
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,181
Do you hear that?

481
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,782
Rickie is that you?

482
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,292
Rickie!!!

483
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,404
If I find out it was you trying to
let her loose you're gonna regret it.

484
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,771
Might as well come out now!

485
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,682
Stupid, fucking motherfucker!

486
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,350
There ain't no way you're getting in here!

487
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,943
Lil Bitch!

488
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,011
I swear to God!

489
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:34,251
I'm gonna bring a gun tomorrow.
I'm going to shoot your ass dead!

490
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,690
You hear that?

491
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,321
Fuckin A. If it ain't one thing it's another.

492
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,653
Sorry.

493
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,521
What, man?

494
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,996
You're friends with Wheeler?

495
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:16,056
You know where I could find him?

496
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,566
No.

497
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,963
Because he said if I brought him 10 bucks,
he'd show me something.

498
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:22,897
What?

499
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,838
Wheeler?

500
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:27,435
- He said -
- Wheeler's a fucking retard you dumb ass.

501
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,284
He's just trying to steal your money, man.

502
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:56,732
Hey, asshole!
Fuckin' fat kid just came up to me, man...

503
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,070
It was you last night?

504
00:47:58,108 --> 00:47:59,166
Yeah, so what?

505
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,040
What's up, Johnny boy?

506
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,807
You know,
I'm sorry you got hurt, Wheeler, but, fuck...

507
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,245
You know, fuck you.

508
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,146
You're just fucking lucky
I didn't tell JT about that.

509
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,743
Yeah? Hey, why the fuck
didn't you then, huh?

510
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,309
Do you see that dip shit over there?

511
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:11,787
Lots of dipshits over there.
Which one are you talking about?

512
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,790
The fucking stoner
with his retarded buddy.

513
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,257
He was looking over here all goddamn period.

514
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,816
He was eyeballing Joann, dude.

515
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,956
You know what, man? Me and JT are fine.

516
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,330
OK, it's you that's he's
fucking worried about.

517
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,335
Look, Wheeler,
JT hasn't fucking been in school in days, man.

518
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,169
Somebody is going to notice and then what?

519
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,265
What?

520
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,741
They'll go looking, you fucking retard.

521
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,175
That's bullshit man.

522
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,907
Nobody cares a fucking shit about JT
except for JT, okay?

523
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,710
Not the school,
not his fucking grandmother,

524
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,115
who's half-near dead anyways, okay?

525
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:44,678
Nobody gives a shit where he goes
or what he does, right?

526
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,052
Nobody but us.

527
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,306
Look at me.

528
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,217
Look at me.

529
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,378
Come on now.

530
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:27,495
Yeah, you fucking like that, don't you,
you fucking dead little fucking zombie.

531
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,123
I'm comin', yeah.

532
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,831
How's her hole doin', man?

533
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:41,105
Unwilling but able as always.

534
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:58,823
We got to...we got to get some lube
or something in there

535
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,092
because she is just bone dry.

536
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,136
What do you think she is, JT?

537
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,810
Our fuck-slave.

538
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:25,114
I mean, seriously, like,

539
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:29,956
I don't know, man, like, what is she
doing here and like how did she get here?

540
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,891
What's your problem?

541
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,191
Nothing.

542
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,096
I'm just asking, you know.

543
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,534
How long have you been here anyway?

544
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,202
I spent the night.

545
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,475
Why?

546
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,914
Because it's starting to stink.

547
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:05,451
Well, that is coming from the wounds.

548
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,463
I smelled it this morning.

549
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,998
What the fuck is that?

550
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:22,407
No worse for wear but... it's warm.

551
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,538
Wet.

552
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,077
Yeah.

553
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,521
That one's mine,
but there's 2 more just like it.

554
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:37,519
Okay.

555
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,560
What are you staring at?

556
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,338
You.

557
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,707
No, you're not.

558
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:46,620
Hey, remember that time when were,
like, 8 or something?

559
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,857
8?

560
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:52,335
Okay, 8, 9, you know, whatever.
Just let me finish.

561
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:55,031
We were 12.

562
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,437
What, was I your first kiss or something?

563
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:09,048
Hey, would you want to
go out with me sometime?

564
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,057
That was a long time ago.

565
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:24,032
I mean, another life.

566
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,601
Nothing lasts forever, Rickie.

567
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,631
- Fuck man.
- Take it easy, man.

568
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,464
I'm sorry, man.

569
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,491
Nice.

570
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,331
You want to head back there with me?

571
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:09,345
Look, Wheeler, I fucking told you already.
I'm not goin' back there.

572
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,547
Fuck!

573
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,071
You get the message shit stain?

574
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,414
What the fuck man?!

575
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,079
What's that, pussy?

576
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,056
He thinks I can't see him when
he's staring and drooling over Joann!

577
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,388
What are they doing now?

578
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,155
Shut your filthy mouth, man.
Shut the fuck up!

579
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,393
All right, you little shits.

580
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,163
Keep your eyes to yourself.

581
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,433
I don't know what the fuck
are you talking about?

582
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:38,740
Fuck!

583
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,369
- Johnny stop! Johnny!
- No more looking at my woman you little shit!

584
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:42,969
You got that?

585
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:43,843
Stop!

586
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,178
Johnny stop!
That¡¦s enough, Okay? I want to go home.

587
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,878
Come on baby,
I'm just defending your honor over here?

588
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,250
No, you're not.
You're just being an asshole!

589
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,725
Stop it!

590
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,922
- Get off of me!
- Look, we're just having a little fun!

591
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,396
- Stop!
- That's all!

592
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,099
Now, you look what you did,
you fucking creep.

593
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,733
You fucking pissed off my girl!

594
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,618
You okay?

595
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,889
Fuck you, you fucking jock motherfuckers!

596
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,793
You fucking-- we don't need
your fucking cheer leading whores!

597
00:55:32,826 --> 00:55:35,361
You know why? Because we got
our own fucking whore

598
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:39,266
and she's the sweetest one in the
whole fuckin town, you asshole.

599
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,965
She's got fucking sweet
tits and she's fucking hot!

600
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,167
- Wheeler, shut the fuck up.
- So fuck you!

601
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,608
She's our fucking sex slut!

602
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,648
Shut the fuck up wheeler!

603
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,783
Johnny's going to take one
fucking look at this dead girl

604
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,453
and he's going to turn around
and fucking bust us man.

605
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:05,722
You understand that?

606
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,560
If we don't fucking come up with something
right now,

607
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:12,159
- we're gonna fucking go to fucking jail, Wheeler.
- Rickie, man, I can't get to jail.

608
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,501
My fuckin' mom's going to kill me...

609
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,562
Stop! Stop! Look,

610
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,439
whatever happens,
we cannot show them the girl, okay?

611
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:20,738
It can't happen.

612
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:23,746
We keep this between us
and you keep your mouth quiet, okay?

613
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,542
Oh shit!

614
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,751
All right little shits!

615
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,721
Don't even think about
making a run for it.

616
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,919
Dwyer's got a baseball bat
and he's a fucking state champ.

617
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,524
Come on you-- Listen, come on you guys.

618
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,197
Wheeler was just fuckin' talkin' shit.
I swear to God, man.

619
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,536
There's nothing down here.

620
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,699
Talking shit?

621
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,507
I guess Dwyer and I can stop fucking
around and kick your asses now, huh?

622
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,875
Yeah.

623
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,281
I guess you're gonna have to.

624
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,023
Fuck you!

625
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:47,723
I'm sorry.

626
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,400
Jesus.

627
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,916
What the fuck?

628
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:16,124
See, she's right there just like I said.

629
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:22,524
What the fuck is this?

630
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,466
It's just what it looks like Dwyer.

631
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,766
Hot-to-trot bitch with a yen for dick.

632
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,630
JT.

633
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,802
Johnny?

634
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:44,076
So you boys decided to come by,
give our girlfriend a ride, huh?

635
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,451
Uh, no.

636
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,479
We were just fucking with Wheeler, all right?

637
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,424
I thought he was shitting us.

638
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,394
Ain't no shitin' going on here, boy.

639
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,794
What's going on here, JT?

640
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:59,734
Why she all tied up
and beat up and shit?

641
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:05,173
Because that's the way she likes it, Dwyer.

642
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,438
Rough!

643
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,173
S&M!

644
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,976
Ain't either of you seen any pornos before?

645
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,245
That's the way we give it to her.

646
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:26,152
You know, whips and chains and shit.

647
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,130
That's the way we give it to her.

648
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:33,858
See, she's hot for it.

649
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,100
You all want to...

650
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,008
No, man.

651
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,137
We're fine. Thanks.

652
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,237
We're fine, Dwyer.

653
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,442
Ain't going in there.

654
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,409
We should leave.

655
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:54,886
2 red blooded all American studs
like you passing on a free pussy?

656
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:55,982
Fuck you.

657
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,230
I don't know.

658
01:00:13,141 --> 01:00:15,835
- C'omn, Johnny.
- What?

659
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,574
What the fuck?

660
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:23,983
Dwyer, no.

661
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,681
Come on, Johnny.

662
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,781
What are you doing?

663
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:28,950
Don't leave me hanging here, man?

664
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,523
What?

665
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:35,963
What, and dip my wick in
a puddle of your spunk?

666
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,763
I may be horny but I'm not desperate.

667
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,359
Shoot.

668
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,130
I got my own sweet pussy
waiting for me tonight.

669
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,587
Yeah?

670
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,112
Why don't you go for the mouth then?

671
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:10,263
See, ah...

672
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,392
she likes it any way she can get it,
Johnny boy.

673
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,107
Come on, Johnny.

674
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,681
The water looks fine.

675
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,414
What?

676
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:38,454
What's the matter, man? You're scared?

677
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,121
Or is she out of your league?

678
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,292
I bet you Joann doesn't do that for you.

679
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,164
You know what, Johnny?
I bet you're full of shit.

680
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,932
I bet that you haven't had your
dick sucked your whole life.

681
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,632
- I bet you never -
- Hey!

682
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,402
Can't deny the lady, now, can we?

683
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:57,508
You the man, Johnny.

684
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,707
You the man.

685
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,316
You the man.

686
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:52,298
Come on baby. It's all right.

687
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:54,303
It's not gonna bite you.

688
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,792
Okay, man, that's enough.

689
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,232
Yeah, get in line, fag.

690
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:26,860
Stop that.

691
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:32,204
Oh shit!

692
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:35,677
Bitch, bitch, bitch...

693
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,377
I'm taking him to the hospital.
Then, we're calling the cops.

694
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:44,215
Oh, you're going to go to
the cops and tell them what?

695
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,949
That you were raping a chick in
a mouth and she bit your dick?

696
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,957
I wasn't raping her.
You said she wanted it.

697
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,982
Yeah well, I'm sure they
heard that one before.

698
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:52,153
- You said she liked it.
- Get off.

699
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:56,495
Prove it in court when Johnny
boy here whips his dick out.

700
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:59,160
Prove it when they show photos of her face.

701
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:02,330
Don't forget about Joann, huh?
How are going to explain this to her?

702
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,999
Well, gee, honey, I was just walking
through this abandoned mental hospital

703
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:08,101
and my weenie was hanging out and I tripped
and fell and guess where it ended up?

704
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,374
That's bullshit. Look what she did to me!

705
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,445
Yeah, well, all the blood's
been rushing down there.

706
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:13,673
I tell you what though?

707
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,318
You hold off on sticking it to Joann for
a couple of weeks, you'll be all right as rain.

708
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:21,016
You tell her you're saving your
strength for the state championships

709
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,991
or whatever the fuck it is you do.

710
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,823
- Fuck you, man.
- Go to the cops.

711
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:31,892
Send me and Rickie and
Wheeler to jail and yourselves.

712
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:35,062
See, you won't be fit to tackle a retard
with polio by the time you get out.

713
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:41,675
Me and the boys? Well, we'll miss a
couple of divorces, a handful of brats and

714
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,703
about a million shifts at the gas station.

715
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:48,444
See, jail is full of motherfuckers like us.

716
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:52,683
- We got nothing to lose.
- Please don't touch me.

717
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,350
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Now, you two leave.

718
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,222
You're not going to get away with this, JT.

719
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,693
"You're not going to get away with this, JT."

720
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,060
Fuckin' stupid fuck. Get the fuck out of here.

721
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,861
Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

722
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:11,462
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to say anything.

723
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:15,238
- And it just came out and -
- And, and stow it, Wheeler.

724
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:16,711
You dumb fuck.

725
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,805
Now at least they'll keep their mouth shut.
They see my point.

726
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,247
We fucked up man.

727
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,274
You are the reason why
Johnny came down here.

728
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:27,051
You are the reason why he got bit and it's
bad enough that those 2 mother fuckers

729
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,456
came down here but look at that shit.

730
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,825
Look at it.

731
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:37,492
I'm not going to put a fucking bag
over her head just to get it up.

732
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,500
And you know what, Rickie?
You know what?

733
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,901
Now, nobody gets what they want.

734
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,099
Joann Skinner, man?

735
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,404
What the fuck were you thinking?

736
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,036
This is the best we're ever going to have.

737
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,136
I can't fucking go to jail.

738
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,203
You're not going to jail!

739
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:52,737
You're gonna get the fuck out of here!

740
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,847
You're gonna go home and
you're gonna go to bed.

741
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,079
You're gonna wake up tomorrow.

742
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:58,350
You're going to school and you're gonna
pretend like none of this shit ever happened.

743
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,685
So, get the fuck out right now.

744
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:01,883
Go!

745
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,288
You know what?
You get the fuck out too.

746
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:07,057
You're not the
fucking boss of this shit.

747
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:10,224
You are disinvited from
my fucking basement, Rick.

748
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:11,631
You fucked up.

749
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,219
Joann.

750
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:36,520
Rickie, what are you doing here?

751
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,460
Look, listen.

752
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:43,158
There's this really, really
fucked-up situation with Johnny.

753
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:45,300
Okay, he's an asshole.
Okay, I know.

754
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:49,566
I know.
And after tonight he'll leave you alone.

755
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:50,833
No, he won't.

756
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:55,068
He's my boyfriend.

757
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:58,137
You're just going to have to deal.

758
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,580
Joann, he doesn't fucking love you.

759
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:08,721
Listen, listen, I just...
whatever you hear after tonight, okay,

760
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:12,888
I want you to know I tried to fucking stop it.

761
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:15,522
You have to believe me.

762
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,726
This is weird.

763
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:24,171
- I, ah -
- Will you just listen to me, please.

764
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:30,941
- No, what if someone sees us or -
- What if someone sees us, huh?

765
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:35,076
What if someone sees us?

766
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,744
Look, who fucking cares?

767
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:16,283
I hope she's hot.

768
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,492
Whoever it is you boys are fightin' over,

769
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:27,001
you're taking a real beating for her.
Jesus Christ, man.

770
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:39,476
You gotta just try and relax, man.
You know?

771
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,449
Have fun.

772
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:44,614
I tell ya.

773
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:52,355
I really wish I was 15 again.

774
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:55,158
I'm 17.

775
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,165
Man, do I wish I was 15 again.

776
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,907
- Do you think they told anybody?
- I don't know, man.

777
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,208
I think we'd be in a heap of
shit right about now if they did.

778
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:48,910
Look, just stay cool, Wheeler, alright?
They're not going to do anything, man.

779
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:52,148
I'm cool, okay?

780
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,213
Thank God for JT, you know?

781
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,587
JT?

782
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,091
You're fucking kidding me, man?

783
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:59,651
If it weren't for fucking JT, none would this
would have happened in the first place.

784
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:03,859
Hey, that's no way to be
talking about friends, man.

785
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:07,995
I should have fucking torched the
whole building the night we found her man.

786
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,629
She's just a dead girl, man.

787
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:11,464
That's all.

788
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,634
You know what, Wheeler?
Just leave me the fuck alone, man.

789
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:15,842
Rickie.

790
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:17,834
Rickie.

791
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,710
Hey!

792
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:22,046
We got to... we got to stick together.

793
01:10:57,953 --> 01:11:00,421
Hold still, baby.

794
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:03,523
I'm trying to fix you up.

795
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,175
Easy.

796
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:25,706
Don't you fuckin' bite her.

797
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,596
I guess we don't have to
worry about that mutt no more.

798
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:11,219
...sold by date, In order to avoid spoilage which
can lead to serious illness. And of course meat,

799
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:15,720
rotten meat in particular when
left unrefrigerated can be toxic.

800
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:19,996
But I'm sure everybody here is very
familiar with the safety issues

801
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,196
concerning poorly kept perishables.

802
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,740
Johnny, think fast.

803
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:35,907
- Some examples of perishables are -
- What's that smell?

804
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:58,329
Oh, my God...

805
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,764
Nice of you to visit.

806
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,497
So, I was expecting someone else.

807
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:36,970
Fuck you, man.

808
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:42,170
Johnny's...I don't know what this chick's got
but she's fucking coming with me to the hospital

809
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:43,473
and then we're going to the cops, man.

810
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,412
I've been fucking her for days.

811
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,039
So has Wheeler.

812
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:49,050
So did you.

813
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:52,952
Stand back JT.
I'm taking her with me.

814
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,683
- There ain't nothing wrong with her.
- Bullshit.

815
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:57,089
Johnny's got his guts stuck back
into him and he's starting to smell

816
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,218
like fucking rotten meat, okay?

817
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:06,599
He's starting to...
he's starting to smell like her.

818
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:08,398
- She bit him.
- No shit she bit him.

819
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:09,597
Now stand the fuck back.

820
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:11,731
I'm taking her with me.

821
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:14,435
You don't need to do that.

822
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:16,876
See, Johnny's dead.

823
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,212
Fuck you, man.

824
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,342
Johnny is not dead.

825
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:24,079
Johnny's dead.

826
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,461
You don't get it, do ya?

827
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:38,762
Johnny is dead.

828
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,133
This bitch is dead.

829
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,364
Now, you're dead too.

830
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,140
You're fucking nuts, man.

831
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:49,006
You're fucking nuts.

832
01:15:56,451 --> 01:16:00,820
You'll like being dead.

833
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:04,053
Dead girl likes it. Don't you?

834
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:11,030
Didn't know what I was going to do
after you boys messed her up.

835
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,558
But now I know, one bite from
her and I can make another.

836
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,868
What...just get off there.

837
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,408
My name is Kim.

838
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,500
- How old are you Kim?
- 25.

839
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,664
Do you have a boyfriend or a husband?
How long are we going to wait here?

840
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:37,311
I thought you said that we were just going to
come here and we're just going to like fucking get-

841
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:38,876
Look, we're going to stay here

842
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,252
until the right fucking one comes along.

843
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,780
All right. We still got a few hours.

844
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:46,794
I ain't just going to settle for the first
fucking thing that walks by man.

845
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:02,038
Okay.

846
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,568
Look at that ass.

847
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:05,841
- You see that?
- Yeah, I see that.

848
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:07,143
I can't fucking miss that.

849
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,208
There's enough fucking cottage cheese
spilling out there to feed Ethiopia.

850
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:11,742
No bro, it ain't that bad at all.

851
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:15,655
Ain't that bad, ain't good enough.
Jesus, Wheeler.

852
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:19,149
Look man, hey, this might be our
only fucking chance, okay?

853
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:22,425
She's the only piece of split tail
that come by the last hour, all right?

854
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:24,159
Look at her jugs, man?

855
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,564
Fucking hot, right?

856
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,467
True.

857
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:30,562
All right.

858
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:32,903
Look, that's the best we're going
to get out here, all right?

859
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:35,567
Let's do it, all right? All right.

860
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:36,736
All right.

861
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:38,473
All right. Fine, fine, fine.

862
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:40,538
Just wait till she comes out.

863
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:41,913
Alright I'm going in.

864
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:51,855
Don't look at me.

865
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,533
Hey, we've got some fuckin' cheap weed.

866
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,330
You want weed or not?

867
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:03,002
Really taking a step down, aren't I?

868
01:19:03,032 --> 01:19:04,368
Smell it.
Love it.

869
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:05,600
It's wonderful.

870
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,110
Where is it?

871
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:12,408
Uh, it's in the trunk.

872
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:20,949
Okay.

873
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:25,649
Yo, JT! The trunk, bro.

874
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,628
JT, the trunk, buddy.

875
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,357
And I ain't giving you nothin' till I seen it.

876
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,826
Yeah. And it better be good.

877
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:34,301
I know good when I see it.

878
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:37,237
So don't be trying to pass off no oregano
on me, you little motherfuckers.

879
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,739
What's wrong with your buddy here?

880
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,678
Slow or something?

881
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,684
Well, I don't see nothing.

882
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:50,912
Well, here baby.

883
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,766
Sons of bitches...

884
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,768
Fuck you!

885
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,666
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Shit!

886
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:49,870
You all right?

887
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:59,520
- You okay? You okay?
- Am I okay?

888
01:20:59,588 --> 01:21:02,079
No, I'm not okay.

889
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:04,318
Not fucking funny, man.

890
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:05,849
You want a tough bitch...

891
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,555
Wasn't she a fuckin' tough bitch.

892
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:09,996
She fuckin' outweighed us both.

893
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:11,430
No fuck you.

894
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:14,367
I didn't even want her to begin with,
you dumb piece of shit...

895
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:15,528
There you are!

896
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,533
Hey, Joann.

897
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:22,941
I want to know what the fuck you did
to my boyfriend?

898
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:24,070
No, you don't.

899
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,206
Just fucking tell me.

900
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,818
Why don't we just show you?

901
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,949
Joann.

902
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:08,881
Okay.

903
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,680
- It's going to be okay.
- Rickie don't leave me.

904
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,778
I'm going to get you out of here okay.
I'm going to get you out of here.

905
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,186
All right.

906
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:18,918
Fuck you!
Your fucking friends kidnapped me.

907
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,393
I fucking stood up for you.

908
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:21,793
I fucking did everything.

909
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:22,728
- Fuck you.
- Quit fighting me.

910
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:23,924
- Quit fighting me, OK?
- No!

911
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,364
Look, I'm here to help you.

912
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,164
I'd never hurt you.
I'd never hurt you.

913
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:30,171
I'm here to help you.

914
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,834
You're here to what, Rick?

915
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:44,143
You're here to save
the damsel in distress?

916
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,881
Be the big hero?

917
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:53,156
Nah, that can't be.
We all know you ain't no hero.

918
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,685
JT, what the fuck is she doing down here, man?

919
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:58,494
Dead girl, Rick.

920
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,864
We can make more.

921
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:07,765
See, all she's got to do is
take one bite out of you and...

922
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:13,003
JT figured it out.

923
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:20,344
Look, I don't know what the
fuck is going on around here

924
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:22,515
but it has nothing to do with me.

925
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:28,052
Sweetheart, I think it's got just about
everything to do with you, doesn't it?

926
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:35,225
Think about it.

927
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:39,570
Folks like us are just cannon fodder
for the rest of the world.

928
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:43,373
But down here, you see we're in control.

929
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:47,780
Now, we call the shots down here, man.

930
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:49,784
Feels good, doesn't it?

931
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,878
It's all right to say.

932
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:57,620
You don't have to be the
nice guy down here, Rickie.

933
01:24:57,659 --> 01:25:00,025
Yeah, man. This is all for you.

934
01:25:00,061 --> 01:25:05,055
Enough with the goddamned
lights already, Wheeler.

935
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:09,059
Even if you did save her, Rick,
whaddya think she's gonna do?

936
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:20,374
JT man, please just let her go.

937
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:23,942
You sure that's what you want?

938
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:25,213
Please.

939
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:30,748
Is that really what you want?

940
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,282
She sure is beautiful.

941
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,318
- Fuck yeah, she is.
- All right, Wheeler. All right.

942
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:39,459
I'm talking to Rickie now, please.

943
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:42,959
JT, man just don't fucking make
me do this, okay?

944
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,699
Look, I get it.

945
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:48,573
All right. You don't want to share
and that's understandable.

946
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,577
I respect it.

947
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:51,806
You want what should have
been yours a long time ago

948
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:54,041
and that's what I'm trying to do for you.

949
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:58,883
I'm doing this for your benefit, Rick.

950
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,945
She's all yours.

951
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,086
Wait, who the fuck is that?

952
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,222
Don't you worry about her, honey.

953
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:13,933
JT.

954
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,408
Who the fuck is that?

955
01:26:22,443 --> 01:26:25,276
You've got me all wrong, man.

956
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:28,908
Do I?

957
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:33,444
No. I'm thinking I know you a little bit better
than you even know yourself these days, Rickie.

958
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,183
Then you know I'm fucking
done with you, man.

959
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,624
Rickie, she is going to send us to jail.

960
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:44,064
And you ain't going to
have her or anybody else.

961
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:45,429
- No.
- You know it's got to be done.

962
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:49,061
Enough with the goddamned
machete already, okay?

963
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,203
Wheeler, what are you doing?

964
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,437
Wheeler, what the fuck are you doing?

965
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:59,674
Wheeler, don't you fucking touch her, man.

966
01:26:59,714 --> 01:27:03,309
Don't you fucking touch her, Wheeler,
I swear to fucking God!

967
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:04,841
- You won't believe it.
- Wheeler I wouldn't.

968
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,855
Wheeler don't you fucking touch her.

969
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,049
That's a bad idea man.

970
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,786
Don't you fucking touch her!

971
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:26,573
What'd you do that for?

972
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:47,889
Well, you sure picked a pretty
shit poor time to man up, Rick.

973
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,796
Who you trying to be anyway, man?

974
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:55,633
Since day one, it's been you and me.

975
01:27:55,670 --> 01:28:00,232
It's been JT and Rickie all the way, man.

976
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,708
And we don't change.

977
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:04,644
We don't have to change
because it's us, man.

978
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:08,809
Rickie and JT, man.

979
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,283
Nothing's got to change between us.

980
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:13,344
Nobody's got to change, you know.

981
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:14,855
It's just you and me, right?

982
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:21,822
Joann Skinner, man?

983
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:29,167
You think she's going to
choose you in the real world?

984
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:35,836
In the real world,
she'd rather die than be with you.

985
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:39,404
Yeah.

986
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:40,414
I know.

987
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:55,527
Rickie, man, just you and me, right?

988
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,806
I'm not feeling so good, man.

989
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:09,207
He cut off your fucking hand, man.

990
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:13,173
I'm not feelin' too good, man.

991
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:22,414
Oh shit!
Jesus!

992
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:25,684
Help me!

993
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,724
Rickie. Rickie!

994
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:42,067
Wheeler, I'm sorry, man,
but she bite you, man.

995
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:45,876
This ain't my fault. I'm sorry.
I got to, Wheeler, I got to.

996
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:57,752
- Somebody help!
- Calm down!

997
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:59,783
Somebody help! No!

998
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:02,660
Somebody help!

999
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:05,222
- Please.
- No, calm down Joann.

1000
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:06,756
- Get off of me!
- It's not going to go in the open!

1001
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:08,359
- No please!
- It's not going to fucking open!

1002
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,462
- Hold on!
- No!

1003
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:13,133
- Help Please!
- Calm down.

1004
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:14,732
Calm down.

1005
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:21,946
Why the fuck don't you
fucking listen to me.

1006
01:30:21,983 --> 01:30:25,475
I try to fucking be good to you!
Just fucking listen to me for one second!

1007
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,219
Joann, please fucking pay
attention to me for once.

1008
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:31,247
Fuck!

1009
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:32,816
Fuck.

1010
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:34,922
Shit.

1011
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:40,196
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1012
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:41,633
I'm fucking sorry, okay?

1013
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:42,795
I'm so sorry.

1014
01:30:42,837 --> 01:30:45,397
Sorry. Sorry.

1015
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,338
It's okay.

1016
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:47,807
Alright, so I'm gonna get you out of here.

1017
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:49,002
Alright, I promise.

1018
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:50,374
I promise.

1019
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:01,586
Fuck. Fuck!

1020
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:10,492
It's okay. It's okay.

1021
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:16,998
Hang on, okay? I'll be right back.

1022
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:19,199
There might be a fucking way out.
Now hold on.

1023
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:27,638
Shit.

1024
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:30,682
Fuck.

1025
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:04,868
He stabbed me.

1026
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:06,539
Rickie.

1027
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:11,878
Oh God.

1028
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:17,016
Fuck JT, why did you do this, man?

1029
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:17,956
Why?

1030
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:21,388
Why did you do it, man?

1031
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:22,953
JT, what the fuck?

1032
01:33:29,236 --> 01:33:31,363
Shit!

1033
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:34,169
I was just trying to help, Rickie.

1034
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:38,339
Hold still. Just breathe.

1035
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:40,506
I'm gonna get you outta here. Hold on.

1036
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:41,640
Okay.

1037
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:43,377
Breathe. It will be okay, okay?

1038
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:44,714
I'll get you out of here.

1039
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:46,515
Just don't tell my grandma, okay?

1040
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:54,887
Rickie, I can feel it inside me.

1041
01:33:54,929 --> 01:33:57,124
Don't worry I'm not going to let you.

1042
01:33:57,164 --> 01:33:58,222
I'm going to get you out of here.

1043
01:33:58,265 --> 01:33:59,630
It will be all right. I'll get you out of here.

1044
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,637
I won't let you die, Joann.

1045
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:09,370
I won't let you die.

1046
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:11,776
What did you say?

1047
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:13,677
I said that I love you.

1048
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:15,875
I love you, Joann, so much.

1049
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:21,114
Rickie.

1050
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:23,248
I can still bite her before it's too late.

1051
01:34:24,925 --> 01:34:27,450
Listen, I love you.

1052
01:34:30,231 --> 01:34:32,199
I do. I love you.

1053
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:33,825
I love you, Joann.

1054
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:39,998
Fucking grow up.

1055
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,800

1056
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:06,160
Take me home, Rickie.

1057
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,827
Please.

1058
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:16,775
God please help me.
