3
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,192
How are ya, Doctor?

4
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:33,028
Hello, Harry.

5
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,449
Hey, Charlie.

6
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:39,826
Hello, Dr. Brewster,
Mr. Stanley.

7
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:42,329
How are ya?
Say, are those all
the passengers you had?

8
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,496
Just the four.

9
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,915
You didn't
put anybody off at
the wrong station, did you?

10
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:48,710
We're here to meet
a friend of the Caldwells,
a Count Alucard.

11
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:52,255
There was
no Count on this train.
All customers.

12
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,507
Say,
there was a lot of stuff
in the baggage car

13
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,134
that might
belong to your Count.

14
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:58,053
Thanks.
We'll take a look at it.

15
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:01,222
All aboard!

16
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,560
Well, does this look
as though

17
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:07,479
he's come to stay for
just a couple of weeks?

18
00:02:07,562 --> 00:02:10,482
No, it doesn't.
I wonder
what's become of him.

19
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:13,568
He's probably coming by car.
Don't worry.
He'll show up.

20
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:23,662
"D-R-A-C..."

21
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,080
What are you
mumbling about?

22
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:28,166
Nothing, nothing.
Just a silly idea hit me.

23
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:31,169
Well, if there's no Alucard,
there's no need of
our waiting around here.

24
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:33,254
I've got to get
back to the office.

25
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,861
Is that you, Matthew?

26
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,863
Yes, ma'am, Miss Kay.
This is Matthew.

27
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:00,740
I brought the trunks
and the boxes,

28
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:03,326
but Mr. Frank said
the Count didn't
come on the train.

29
00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:04,953
Oh.

30
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,205
Well, put them
in the guesthouse
as I told you.

31
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:10,875
Oh, yes, ma'am,
but I have to have some help.
They're amazingly heavy.

32
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,585
Then get some of
the other boys to help you.

33
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:16,631
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Come on, Sam. Come on.

34
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:22,345
Matthew's back
from town.

35
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:23,763
Oh, did the Count come?

36
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:25,557
No, not yet.

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,100
If you only had a phone,

38
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:29,227
Frank would have called
after the train arrived.

39
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,354
Believe me, if I still
lived here, I'd have one,

40
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:34,023
even if I had to
string the wires myself.

41
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:36,025
There are other
means of communication.

42
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:37,610
Oh. Please, Kay.

43
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:40,739
No lectures on
metaphysics tonight, huh?

44
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:43,908
You should allow your mind
to explore the unknown,
Claire,

45
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:46,703
then you wouldn't
laugh at telepathy.

46
00:03:46,786 --> 00:03:50,832
I know Count Alucard
will be here tonight,
without benefit of telephone.

47
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,461
Oh.
He probably missed the train
and will come down tomorrow.

48
00:03:54,544 --> 00:03:57,046
I must run in
and see Dad a minute
before I dress for the party.

49
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,423
See you later.

50
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:48,765
You do not know
why you came here tonight.

51
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:52,268
It was because
I wished you here.

52
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:54,145
Well, why?

53
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,230
Isn't Count Alucard...

54
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:57,899
I wished you here
to warn you.

55
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:06,115
The Angel of Death hovers
over a great house.

56
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:08,660
I see it in ruins.

57
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,371
Weeds, vines growing over it,

58
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:15,333
bats flying in and out
the broken windows.

59
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,002
But I want to know
of Count Alucard.
Is he coming?

60
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,548
Do you hear me?

61
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:23,508
Do you hear me, Queen Zimba?

62
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:26,261
"Alucard" is not his name.

63
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:29,013
You must stop him
before it is too late.

64
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:32,350
Stop him before
death comes to Dark Oaks.

65
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,519
Tell me if he is
coming tonight.

66
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:39,816
I see you
marrying a corpse,

67
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:41,901
living in a grave.

68
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:43,945
I see...

69
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:09,429
Queen Zimba!

70
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:17,914
Uh, Stephen!

71
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:26,631
This excitement
over Kay's Count
has worn me out.

72
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:30,051
If you'll all excuse me,
I'll let Stephen
take me upstairs.

73
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:31,970
Good night, Colonel.
Good night.

74
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,349
He's holding up
very well.
Good night.

75
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:38,476
Good night, Colonel.

76
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,729
Well, Father,
I'm afraid we'll have
to do this all over again

77
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,439
when Count Alucard
does come.

78
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:44,816
I'm afraid so.

79
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,484
I hope you're not
too tired, Father.

80
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,737
No, I feel fine.
Now, you run along and dance.

81
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:51,322
Stephen will
help me upstairs.

82
00:07:51,406 --> 00:07:52,824
Good night, children.
Good night, then.

83
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,742
Good night, Father.
Good night, Colonel.

84
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:56,285
Good night.

85
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,412
I'll smoke a cigar
before going to bed.

86
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,416
That'll be all
for now, Stephen.

87
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:44,625
Yes, sir.

88
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:11,235
Kay, you're worried
about something.

89
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:12,987
I wish you'd tell me
what it is.

90
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:14,906
Wouldn't you be upset
if you gave a reception,

91
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,908
and your guest of honor
didn't appear?

92
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,701
Is that all?

93
00:09:18,785 --> 00:09:20,411
Isn't that enough?

94
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:23,664
Yes, I suppose it is,
but I rather thought
you might be worrying

95
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:26,501
about that old Hungarian gypsy
you brought back with you.

96
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:29,087
I understand
she died tonight.

97
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,296
Queen Zimba?

98
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:31,756
"Queen"?

99
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,257
That old swamp cat
with a cabin

100
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:35,635
full of dried lizards
and stuffed toads?

101
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:38,346
It's good riddance,
if you ask me.

102
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,598
How did you know
she was dead?

103
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:44,435
That sort of
news travels fast.
One of the farmhands told me.

104
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,396
He also said
you were there when she died.

105
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,358
I'd hoped
no one knew that.

106
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:51,442
Why?

107
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:52,944
She died of a heart attack.

108
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,904
Certainly, your being there
could have no bearing on it.

109
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:57,365
Oh, they'll ask questions.

110
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:59,951
What was I doing there,
and what brought on
the attack?

111
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:04,372
And if I told them,
no one around here
would believe it.

112
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:08,543
What do they know of
these occult matters?
Blind fools.

113
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:13,005
Kay, I think it's about time
I talked to you frankly.

114
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:14,882
We're not blind,
and we're not fools.

115
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:16,467
We're just plain,
sensible people

116
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:19,011
that refuse to be fooled
by a lot of supernatural
nonsense.

117
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:21,139
"Nonsense"?
Exactly.

118
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:23,933
There's no magic
in dried lizards
and dead chickens.

119
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,979
Ever since you met
this Count Alucard
in Budapest, you've changed.

120
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:29,313
I hardly know you.

121
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:35,444
Kay, let me take you away
from all this morbid business.

122
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:37,697
A six-months' honeymoon,
a year, if you like.

123
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,031
We won't
come back here until

124
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:40,783
you've overcome
some of these strange ideas.

125
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,286
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:44,662
"Sorry"?

127
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,165
Does that mean
you're breaking
our engagement?

128
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:50,418
Oh, no.
You mustn't even think that.

129
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,171
Then what is it, Kay?
There must be some reason.

130
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:55,047
Of course
there's a reason, Frank.

131
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:58,426
Since we were kids,
there's never been
anyone in my heart but you.

132
00:10:58,509 --> 00:10:59,844
You know that.

133
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,846
But, well...

134
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,935
Don't ever doubt me, Frank.
No matter what happens,
believe in me.

135
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:11,189
Believe
that what I'm doing
is best for us both.

136
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:14,650
Has it anything
to do with Alucard?

137
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:17,945
I see.

138
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm afraid
there's something
I must tell you, Kay.

139
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:24,911
Alucard is an impostor,
a fake.

140
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:26,495
How can you say
such a thing?

141
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,206
I wrote
to Senator Manfield.

142
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,874
His reply informed me
that Count Alucard

143
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,168
is not known at
the Hungarian embassy.

144
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:34,503
You must be very proud
of that bit of snooping.

145
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:35,713
I only did
what any man would do

146
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,298
to protect the girl
he intends to marry.

147
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:40,968
Miss Kay!

148
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,183
Dr. Brewster,
is there anything I can do?

149
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,392
No, no.
You stay here.

150
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:49,810
Keep the party moving.

151
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,197
Father!

152
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,165
Get some water!

153
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,630
Looks like
the Colonel fell asleep
and dropped his cigar.

154
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:18,798
That's what started the fire.

155
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,967
Yeah, that's
probably what happened.

156
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,182
There's no evidence
of asphyxiation.

157
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,351
His heart might
have stopped beating
before the fire.

158
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:32,436
He might even have
died in his sleep.

159
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,690
He looks as though
he were literally
frightened to death.

160
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,319
It's purely a reflex
of the facial muscles.

161
00:12:40,403 --> 00:12:42,280
Doctor,
what are those two marks

162
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:43,864
on the throat?
They don't look like burns.

163
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,999
Come, Claire.
I think you'd better go.

164
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:19,233
Announce Count Alucard.

165
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:23,070
Explain that I came by motor
and was delayed.

166
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:28,075
I'm sorry, sir,
but Colonel Caldwell
died tonight,

167
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,036
and the family
isn't receiving.

168
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:31,495
Announce me!

169
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:32,705
Yes, sir.

170
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,176
Central,

171
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:49,680
I called Professor Lazlo
at Muirfield University
about a half an hour ago.

172
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:52,308
Will you please
check the call for me?

173
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:56,228
This is Dr. Harry Brewster,
228. Thank you.

174
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:15,539
Hello?

175
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:18,084
Yes, this is Harry
Brewster speaking.

176
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,878
Fine, thank you.

177
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:25,299
Why, I called to find out
if you know anything about

178
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:29,720
<i>a titled Hungarian
family named Alucard.</i>

179
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:32,390
<i>A-L-U-C-A-R-D.</i>

180
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:34,809
Alucard? No.

181
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:38,145
I'm sure there
is no such family.
The name is not Hungarian.

182
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,731
Well, can you tell me,

183
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,484
is it possible
there's a Count Dracula
still living?

184
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,070
Dracula?

185
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,030
I'm sure there is not.

186
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:51,367
History says
the last Count Dracula
died in the Middle Ages.

187
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,660
Why do you ask?

188
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,539
A certain Count Alucard
is visiting a friend of mine.

189
00:14:56,622 --> 00:15:00,793
I happened to notice that
the name spelled backward
is "Dracula". (CHUCKLES)

190
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:02,169
It made me curious.

191
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:04,088
That is strange.

192
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,840
According to
the legends of my people,

193
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:09,093
the last Count Dracula
became one of the undead,

194
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:10,636
a vampire,

195
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:13,931
and was finally destroyed
in the 19th century.

196
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:17,435
I am considered
somewhat of an authority
on the subject.

197
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,687
<i>I know, Professor.</i>
<i>That's why I called you.</i>

198
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,147
<i>If this man is an impostor,</i>

199
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,107
<i>why should he assume that name
over all others?</i>

200
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,317
Oh. He wouldn't.
Not if he were sane.

201
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:28,946
In Transylvania,
the name is associated
only with evil.

202
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,991
I advise you to be
very careful of that man.

203
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:33,951
Well, from your tone,
I gather

204
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:37,204
you don't entirely
disbelieve the legends
of the former Dracula.

205
00:15:37,705 --> 00:15:38,998
In my research,

206
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:42,960
I have uncovered data
which I cannot
entirely disprove.

207
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:47,715
I do not say I believe,
but in honesty,
I cannot say I disbelieve.

208
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:50,759
I repeat, be very,
very careful of that man.

209
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,888
I will, Professor.
Thank you very much.

210
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:55,806
Goodbye, sir.

211
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:05,733
You will find this will
a comparatively
simple document,

212
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,693
owing chiefly to
the fact that you two girls

213
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:09,904
are the only living kin
of Colonel Caldwell.

214
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,908
It divides the entire estate,
cash, securities and
all evenly between...

215
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:17,828
Pardon me, Judge Simmons.
May I ask the date
of that will?

216
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,038
August 24th.

217
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,331
It was made
on the occasion

218
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:23,167
of Miss Claire's attaining
legal age and responsibility.

219
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,628
Then there's a will
of a later date.

220
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,027
There's no
important difference
between them, Claire.

221
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,738
There's a mighty
important difference
for you, Kay.

222
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:55,574
According to this,
you get nothing
but the plantation.

223
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,701
Claire gets
all cash and securities.

224
00:16:58,953 --> 00:17:02,122
It's properly witnessed
and can't be disputed,

225
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,959
but I can't imagine
what your father
was thinking of.

226
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:07,086
It's the way I wanted it.

227
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:11,048
To divide the estate otherwise
would have meant
selling the plantation.

228
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,802
I love Dark Oaks,
and hope to live here always.

229
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:16,720
But, my dear child,
it takes real capital

230
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:19,348
to operate
a plantation of this size.

231
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:21,475
I wouldn't worry
about that, Judge.

232
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,227
I think Colonel Caldwell
knew what he was doing.

233
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:26,230
Oh. Oh, I see.

234
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,691
Well,
I'd offer my congratulations,

235
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:31,652
but this hardly
seems the proper time.

236
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:34,238
That seems
to end the matter.

237
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,157
I'll start the legal machinery
in motion at once.

238
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:40,744
In fact, I'll start it today,
if the clerk's office
is still open.

239
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:43,080
Goodbye.
Oh, don't bother, Claire.

240
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,873
I'll find my way out,
thank you.

241
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:46,292
Goodbye, Judge.

242
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:49,587
I can't understand
how you've been able
to get along without servants.

243
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,381
I take it that none of them
have returned since
that night.

244
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:56,510
No,
but I'll arrange for others
if I find I need them.

245
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:59,430
Well, of course,
you'll know what
you want to do.

246
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:02,641
Come along, Claire.
Let's leave these two
alone for a while.

247
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:06,687
I'll see you again
before I leave.

248
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,276
I'm so terribly
sorry for Frank.

249
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,445
I'm afraid he's living
in a fool's paradise.

250
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:15,821
"A fool's paradise"?

251
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:18,282
Yes. I'm certain
Kay doesn't intend
to marry him.

252
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,951
Well, what's the trouble?
Count Alucard?

253
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:22,786
She couldn't marry him.

254
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,122
There's something, well,
repulsive about him.

255
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,750
The way he came in
the night Father died...

256
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,168
Oh, I don't know.

257
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,462
I understand he left
almost immediately.

258
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:32,963
At least that
was decent of him.

259
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,382
Yes, but...

260
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:38,510
I'm positive
Kay's been seeing him
more or less secretly.

261
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:39,928
Why do you say that?

262
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,722
A couple of nights ago,
after I had gone to bed,

263
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:44,224
I heard them talking
in the hall downstairs.

264
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:46,310
Somehow,
I didn't like the idea,

265
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:48,395
and I went to
the head of the stairs
to make sure.

266
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,480
And?

267
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,815
Kay was alone
in the lower hall,

268
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:54,026
but she was
looking up at me as if...

269
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:57,821
Well, as if she'd
been caught at something
she wasn't very proud of.

270
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:59,406
I see.

271
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:03,035
Did you mention it
to her?

272
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:06,955
Yes,
but she pooh-poohed the idea,
said I probably was dreaming.

273
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,793
I let it go at that,
but I wasn't dreaming.
I hadn't been asleep.

274
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:13,796
Hmm.
That does sound strange.

275
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:24,848
Have you been
in the guesthouse

276
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,433
since the night
your father died?

277
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:28,727
No, but surely,
you don't think
Count Alucard...

278
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:30,813
I don't know what to think.

279
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:34,358
He couldn't be living in town
without my knowing it.

280
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:38,612
I'd like to take
a look at his belongings,
if he hasn't taken them away.

281
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:41,824
He couldn't have
done that alone,
they were too heavy.

282
00:19:41,907 --> 00:19:44,326
This might be
a very good time.

283
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:59,174
Two large chests,
as well as the trunks
came on the train.

284
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:02,344
I don't know
what's become of them.
They were put in here.

285
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:24,742
That's strange.
They're not in there, either.

286
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:30,330
Well, it may not be ethical,

287
00:20:30,414 --> 00:20:34,251
but there are reasons why
we ought to find out more
about the Count.

288
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:49,600
Well, he didn't have
any handbags.

289
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,143
I don't like it,
Claire.

290
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,605
He can't be traveling around
with only the clothes
he's wearing.

291
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,871
See what I meant
about Frank and Kay?

292
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,959
I don't like it, Claire.

293
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,212
I don't like it one bit!

294
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:20,506
You've got to leave here
and go back to town,

295
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:22,674
and the sooner, the better.

296
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:25,260
You sound as if
I was in some kind of danger.

297
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:28,639
I'd rather not go into that,
but I insist upon
your leaving.

298
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:32,184
You can go in with me
and send for
your things later.

299
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:35,354
Well, I can't leave Kay alone.
If I'm in danger,
she must be, too.

300
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:37,731
I'm going to make
one last attempt
to persuade her to leave.

301
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:39,233
If she won't...

302
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:44,071
Well, if she won't,
I want you to join me

303
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:47,658
in swearing out
an insanity complaint
against her.

304
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,243
An insanity complaint?

305
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,539
Are you serious?
Kay's my sister.

306
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:58,418
Claire,
everybody's in danger here,
Kay more than anyone else.

307
00:21:58,502 --> 00:21:59,670
If she won't
leave voluntarily,

308
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:01,880
then we've just
got to force her.

309
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:06,176
Yes, but she'd be
arrested, put in an asylum.
I'd never do that to her.

310
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,222
Claire, don't you see?
We've got to protect Kay
from herself.

311
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:17,909
Yes, what is it?

312
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:21,747
You remember me,
don't you, Mr. Kirby?

313
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,291
Yes, of course.
You're Colonel
Caldwell's daughter.

314
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:25,959
Sorry to hear
about your father.

315
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:27,544
Thank you.

316
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:30,422
Uh, may we come in?
We want to be married.

317
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:31,923
Married?

318
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:37,763
Yes, of course.
Come right in.

319
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:40,432
Ma! Cecilia!

320
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,480
In a few moments, my dear,
you will become
Countess Alucard.

321
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:17,302
Everything has
worked out as we planned.

322
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:21,056
This house is ours.
No one else has
any claim on it.

323
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:25,852
I like old houses,
and I like your countryside
and the swampland.

324
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:27,854
It's very different
from your homeland.

325
00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:29,773
That is why I like it.

326
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:32,651
My land is dry
and desolate.

327
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:36,029
The soil is red with
the blood of 100 races.

328
00:26:36,113 --> 00:26:38,865
There is no life
left there.

329
00:26:38,949 --> 00:26:42,202
Here, you have
a young and vital race.

330
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,625
You've spoken of your people,
but I want to know more.

331
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:52,796
Their legends,
their mystery,

332
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,381
their gifts.

333
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:58,051
Perhaps someday,
we may return there.

334
00:26:59,177 --> 00:27:03,557
As I have told you, my dear,
ours will be a different life,

335
00:27:04,474 --> 00:27:07,144
without material needs.

336
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:10,397
A life that will
last through eternity.

337
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:22,242
I'll see who it is.

338
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:34,171
I told you not to
come here again, Frank.
I'm sorry.

339
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:36,214
Please, Kay.
I've got to talk to you.

340
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:40,510
Kay, I must know
what this is all about.

341
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:42,846
I know that you and Alucard
are meeting secretly.

342
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:44,598
I followed you tonight

343
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:46,349
I don't know where you went,
because I lost you, but...

344
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,935
We went to Mr. Kirby's.

345
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:50,604
We were married.

346
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:53,398
"Married"?

347
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,693
No.
No, you couldn't have!

348
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,613
I told you before,
we were married tonight.

349
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:14,336
You'll save us all
a lot of unpleasantness

350
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,087
by going back
to town with me tonight,

351
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:18,215
and taking
the first train out
in the morning.

352
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:20,467
I'm afraid
I do not understand.

353
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:24,221
Then I'll make it clear.
You're going back to
town with me tonight.

354
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:25,972
In the morning,
you'll take
the first train out.

355
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:28,058
Kay will have
the marriage annulled
and if you try to stop her,

356
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:31,311
or show up in this
part of the country again,
you'll be jailed!

357
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Kay!

358
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:23,775
Frank!

359
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:26,403
My boy!

360
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:09,028
Harry.

361
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,159
Harry, how did I get here?
Did you bring me here
from Dark Oaks?

362
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:16,494
No, you came alone,
about a couple of minutes ago.

363
00:32:16,744 --> 00:32:18,621
What's happened, Frank?

364
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:27,046
Harry.

365
00:32:28,298 --> 00:32:29,424
Harry.

366
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:32,218
Harry, I've killed Kay!

367
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:36,139
It's all mixed up,
but I know I shot her twice.

368
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:37,724
Harry, am I insane?

369
00:32:37,807 --> 00:32:38,808
Could I have shot
through Alucard

370
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:40,768
and killed her
without hurting him?

371
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:42,061
Tell me what happened.

372
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,939
Well,
I shot right through him.

373
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:46,983
I shot right through him!

374
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:50,153
Kay screamed and fell,
and he just stood there.

375
00:32:50,236 --> 00:32:54,616
Just stood there,
staring at me.
Just staring at me.

376
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,576
You don't
believe that, do you?

377
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:57,785
Nobody will.

378
00:32:57,869 --> 00:32:59,454
Yes, I believe you.

379
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:00,580
Have you got
your revolver?

380
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:01,873
I dropped it in the drive.

381
00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:04,167
But you haven't told me,
just what happened?

382
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,543
Kay and Alucard
were married tonight.

383
00:33:05,627 --> 00:33:06,628
I know. I followed them.

384
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:08,213
Well, didn't you try
to stop the wedding?

385
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:10,298
A tree smashed my car,
and I lost them.

386
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:11,674
Then I went back
to Dark Oaks,

387
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:14,052
and I found them there
and got in a fight with him.

388
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:15,678
He got me by the throat.

389
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,847
It was like one of
those crazy nightmares

390
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:20,016
where you can't move,
or struggle or...

391
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,227
I had no more
strength against him
than a baby.

392
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,521
He just threw me aside.

393
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:25,855
Then I fired.

394
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:28,733
The bullets went through him
without even hurting him,
and...

395
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:29,817
And killed Kay.

396
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:31,236
What did you do then?

397
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,864
I don't know!
I just seemed to be
running and falling and...

398
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:38,743
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know anything
except I found myself here.

399
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:40,537
I don't even know
if it's real!

400
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:42,997
Maybe it's a nightmare,
or something.

401
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:45,583
Just rest yourself
for a while, Frank.

402
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:47,794
We'll find out
just how much of it happened.

403
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:57,971
Here. Drink this.

404
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:02,767
Lie down, Frank.

405
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:24,594
May I inquire
what you are doing here?

406
00:37:34,187 --> 00:37:37,023
I was about to ask you
the same question.

407
00:37:37,106 --> 00:37:39,484
Tonight, Miss Caldwell
and I were married.

408
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,528
I am now master
of this house.

409
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:45,948
You see,
you owe me an explanation.

410
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:47,784
Well,
I came here to see Katherine.

411
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:50,161
The door was open,
she didn't answer my call,

412
00:37:50,244 --> 00:37:52,872
and I thought
I heard somebody
here in the cellar.

413
00:37:52,955 --> 00:37:56,793
I, too, thought
that I heard someone
in the cellar.

414
00:37:56,876 --> 00:37:58,127
Come.

415
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:38,042
Dr. Brewster, what on Earth
brings you here
this time of night?

416
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:42,004
I hope nothing's happened
to Claire.

417
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:43,172
No.

418
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:46,676
No, she was worried
that something
had happened to you.

419
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:48,052
I'm sorry.

420
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,222
Count Alucard and I
were married tonight.

421
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:53,766
Yes,
so the Count told me.

422
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:57,228
It was the way
we wanted it,
quiet and alone.

423
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:01,190
That's the way
we're going to live, Doctor.

424
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:04,402
You see,
I'm engaged in some
scientific research.

425
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:07,029
It will take up all
of our daylight hours.

426
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:10,533
And we'll have
no time for social life.

427
00:39:10,616 --> 00:39:12,660
We want you to
explain this to Claire.

428
00:39:12,743 --> 00:39:13,911
And to Frank.

429
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:16,956
I'm fond of Frank.

430
00:39:18,749 --> 00:39:22,336
But, of course,
he must never come here again.

431
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:28,301
I'd like you to tell
all our friends not to come.

432
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:31,345
If Judge Simmons has
papers for us to sign,

433
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:32,847
tell him to bring them
in the evening.

434
00:39:33,264 --> 00:39:36,100
Katherine is
going to assist me
in my research.

435
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:37,476
I see.

436
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:42,189
Well, there doesn't seem to be
any more for me to say,

437
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:45,693
so, if you'll pardon me,
Katherine, I'll be leaving.

438
00:39:45,776 --> 00:39:48,070
Good night.
Goodbye, Doctor.

439
00:39:48,154 --> 00:39:49,864
And say goodbye
to Frank.

440
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:06,213
Perhaps I should emphasize
some of Katherine's wishes.

441
00:40:06,297 --> 00:40:10,051
When I came to Dark Oaks,
I was not graciously welcomed.

442
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:14,555
Now, the position has changed.
I am master.

443
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,934
Anyone who enters here
without my permission,

444
00:40:18,017 --> 00:40:19,894
will be
considered a trespasser.

445
00:40:53,427 --> 00:40:56,722
Good morning, Sarah.
Will you set
another place, please?

446
00:40:56,806 --> 00:40:59,684
For Mr. Stanley,
he slept on the couch
in the office last night.

447
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:01,644
There's nobody
in there now, sir.

448
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:04,814
There's
a blanket on the couch,
but no sign of Mr. Frank.

449
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:06,941
Why didn't you put him
in the spare bedroom?

450
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:10,611
No wonder he never
stayed for breakfast.

451
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:13,906
I'll just take coffee
this morning, Sarah.

452
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,957
- Good morning, Sarah.
- Good morning, Judge.

453
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,875
It's Judge Simmons, Doctor.

454
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,293
Give Sarah
your hat and coat, Judge,

455
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:27,753
and come in
and have some
breakfast with me.

456
00:41:27,837 --> 00:41:31,132
I'll keep my coat on.
I can only stay a minute.

457
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:32,383
Quite a rain we had.

458
00:41:32,466 --> 00:41:34,802
Yes, started about 4:00.

459
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:36,595
Claire isn't here yet?
No.

460
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:39,598
No, I expect her
any minute, though.

461
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:42,226
I was up most of the night
studying that
insanity complaint

462
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:44,103
you got out against Katherine.

463
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:45,771
What did you decide?

464
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:50,901
Well, if I didn't know you,
I'd be suspicious
of your motives.

465
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:53,863
You have no evidence
of insanity, Harry.

466
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:55,364
The fact that
she wants to live alone

467
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:58,951
at Dark Oaks may be eccentric,
but that's all.

468
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:03,664
And her infatuation
for this Count,
even if he's an impostor...

469
00:42:03,748 --> 00:42:05,166
Well,
that may be bad judgment,

470
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:08,377
but it certainly
couldn't be
construed as insanity.

471
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:10,463
They were married
last night by Kirby.

472
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:13,299
Oh.

473
00:42:14,008 --> 00:42:18,095
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Katherine's like a niece
to me.

474
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:20,890
You're wanted on the phone,
Judge Simmons.

475
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:24,018
It's Mrs. Simmons, sir.
She says it's important.

476
00:42:26,937 --> 00:42:28,773
You better take it
in my office, Judge.

477
00:42:28,856 --> 00:42:30,149
Oh, yes, thank you.

478
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:39,158
Thank you. Yes?

479
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:40,868
Yes, dear.

480
00:42:42,578 --> 00:42:43,913
What?

481
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:47,333
Yes.

482
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,086
Well, I'll go right over
to the courthouse.

483
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:51,504
Goodbye.

484
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:56,383
Frank Stanley
surrendered to the sheriff
a while ago.

485
00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:58,677
Told some sort of a story
about killing Katherine.

486
00:43:00,054 --> 00:43:02,056
That's not so, Judge.
I know.

487
00:43:02,139 --> 00:43:04,600
He came here in
the middle of the night
in a delirious condition

488
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,018
and told me the same story.

489
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:09,188
I gave him a sedative
and I drove out to Dark Oaks.

490
00:43:09,438 --> 00:43:10,856
I talked to Katherine,

491
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:13,400
and that was long after
Frank said he'd killed her.
Oh!

492
00:43:13,484 --> 00:43:16,904
Well, you'd better come over
to the courthouse
and tell them that.

493
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:22,827
Sarah?

494
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:26,413
Professor Lazlo
is arriving here

495
00:43:26,497 --> 00:43:27,957
from Memphis on
the morning train.

496
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,750
He's spending
a few days here.

497
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:31,252
You make him comfortable,
will you, please?

498
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:32,711
Yes, sir.

499
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:36,882
Morning, Bob.
Good morning, Richard.

500
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:41,637
Come in.

501
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,013
Good morning, gentlemen.

502
00:43:43,097 --> 00:43:44,390
Morning, Coroner.

503
00:43:44,473 --> 00:43:45,933
Where's Frank, Sheriff?

504
00:43:46,016 --> 00:43:47,017
The deputy's fetching him.

505
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:48,602
We're all going
out to Dark Oaks.

506
00:43:48,686 --> 00:43:50,104
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

507
00:43:50,187 --> 00:43:52,815
Dr. Brewster says
that Frank is insane.

508
00:43:52,898 --> 00:43:54,358
I talked to
Katherine and her husband

509
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:55,985
after Frank was
supposed to have shot her.

510
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:57,069
What?

511
00:43:58,154 --> 00:44:00,781
Well, I'm going to
Dark Oaks, anyway,
and talk to them myself.

512
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:02,575
No need to go
until evening.

513
00:44:02,658 --> 00:44:04,493
Katherine and her husband
will be away all day.

514
00:44:04,577 --> 00:44:06,328
Yeah?
Where will they be?

515
00:44:06,412 --> 00:44:07,496
Well, I don't know,
but they told me

516
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,790
to tell Claire
they wouldn't be at home.

517
00:44:09,874 --> 00:44:11,292
I'm going to take
Frank out there, anyway.

518
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:12,877
Maybe he'll come
to his senses

519
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,003
if we make him
go over the ground

520
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:15,337
like he covered it
in his confession.

521
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:17,298
I wish you
wouldn't do that, Sheriff.

522
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:20,509
Frank has had a shock.
What he needs is
complete relaxation.

523
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:23,679
Frank Stanley has
confessed to murder.
I have to act on it.

524
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,431
It won't hurt him to
ride out there with us.

525
00:44:25,514 --> 00:44:27,308
I give you my word
that it will.

526
00:44:27,391 --> 00:44:28,601
That's too bad!

527
00:44:28,684 --> 00:44:29,977
But money and position
don't rate him

528
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,105
any better treatment
than anyone else from me.

529
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:35,357
Did he act crazy to you,
Dr. Peters?

530
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:37,193
No, can't say
that he did.

531
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:40,321
A little irrational,
maybe, same as anyone
after committing murder.

532
00:44:40,529 --> 00:44:41,530
Hmm.

533
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:44,033
You can come along
if you like, Doc.

534
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:45,659
If everything's all right,
I'll turn him over to you,

535
00:44:45,743 --> 00:44:46,994
forget all about
the confession.

536
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,079
Now,
that ought to be all right.

537
00:45:04,261 --> 00:45:06,388
Funny that they'd leave
the door open.

538
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,853
Anyone here?

539
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:19,985
Suppose you tell us
where you were
when you shot Katherine,

540
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:21,445
and where she and
her husband were?

541
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:22,905
There's nothing to
worry about, Frank.

542
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:26,700
Go on. Enact the scene
just as you think it happened.

543
00:45:26,784 --> 00:45:28,244
It was in the library.

544
00:46:14,373 --> 00:46:15,958
I seem to remember
running out there

545
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:17,626
and dropping
the gun in the driveway.

546
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,087
Are you sure
you didn't drive off
in your car, Frank?

547
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:21,422
Oh, no, no,
I couldn't have.

548
00:46:21,505 --> 00:46:24,174
Because I remember
a tree fell on it
earlier in the evening

549
00:46:24,258 --> 00:46:25,843
while I was
following Kay and Alucard.

550
00:46:25,926 --> 00:46:27,553
About what time was that,
you remember?

551
00:46:27,636 --> 00:46:29,513
It's all so mixed up.

552
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:33,058
I just don't know,
but I'm sure
I went out that way.

553
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:36,395
Well, come on, Frank.
Suppose you'd show us
just where.

554
00:46:46,655 --> 00:46:49,742
I was here,
but I don't remember
anything after that.

555
00:46:55,205 --> 00:46:57,124
Remember this, Frank?

556
00:47:23,692 --> 00:47:25,861
I think
we'd better go back
to the office, Doctor,

557
00:47:25,986 --> 00:47:27,613
while you do some explaining.

558
00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:33,369
Kay! Kay, my darling!

559
00:47:49,635 --> 00:47:51,053
Good evening, Doctor.

560
00:47:51,136 --> 00:47:52,471
Has Professor Lazlo
arrived?

561
00:47:52,554 --> 00:47:54,765
Yes, sir. He's been here
all day, in and out.

562
00:47:54,848 --> 00:47:56,725
Can I fix you
something to eat, Doctor?

563
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:58,060
The professor's
had his dinner.

564
00:47:58,143 --> 00:47:59,353
No, thanks.

565
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:02,564
Professor,
I'm glad to see you.

566
00:48:02,648 --> 00:48:04,942
I heard about
the tragic events
of last night.

567
00:48:05,025 --> 00:48:07,403
And I called at the courthouse
several times this afternoon,

568
00:48:07,486 --> 00:48:08,946
but they wouldn't
let me see you.

569
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:10,531
Step inside.
Thank you.

570
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:13,826
The sheriff believes
that I'm an accessory

571
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:16,036
after the fact
in the murder of Katherine.

572
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,538
And I can't say
that I blame him.

573
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:18,789
Why?

574
00:48:18,872 --> 00:48:21,792
He can't believe that
I spoke to Katherine
after Frank shot her.

575
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:25,254
And because
I urged him to keep away
from Dark Oaks until tonight,

576
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:27,923
he thinks I intended
to hide her body
during the day.

577
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:29,842
But he didn't arrest you?
No.

578
00:48:29,925 --> 00:48:31,385
No, he questioned me
most of the day,

579
00:48:31,468 --> 00:48:33,262
but he's not quite ready
to hold me.

580
00:48:33,387 --> 00:48:36,765
Then, you didn't tell him
what we believe?

581
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:39,810
Well, the chances
of convincing
a hardheaded sheriff

582
00:48:39,893 --> 00:48:41,770
that we were
dealing with a vampire
seemed pretty slim.

583
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:43,522
Very.

584
00:48:43,605 --> 00:48:46,024
And yet, I am satisfied
that such is the case.

585
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:50,070
Alucard is
undoubtedly a vampire.

586
00:48:50,154 --> 00:48:52,197
Probably a descendant
of Count Dracula.

587
00:48:53,282 --> 00:48:55,117
Are you sure we're not
allowing our imagination

588
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,703
to run away
with our common sense,
Professor?

589
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,373
Can you suggest
any other explanation

590
00:49:01,457 --> 00:49:03,625
for the events of
the past few days?

591
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:05,169
No.

592
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:07,838
Neither can I give
a lucid explanation
of a vampire.

593
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:08,964
Mmm-hmm.

594
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:13,177
Broadly speaking,
a vampire is
an earthbound spirit

595
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,139
whose body comes
to life at night
and scours the countryside,

596
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:20,851
satisfying a ravenous appetite
for the blood of the living.

597
00:49:20,934 --> 00:49:24,354
This it does by drawing it
from the throat of its victim.

598
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:27,983
That's a nauseating thought!

599
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:31,195
They're supposed
to be immortals,
no doubt?

600
00:49:31,278 --> 00:49:32,446
Uh, practically.

601
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:35,240
So long as they return
to their graves
before sunrise.

602
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:38,285
Between then and sunset,
they remain in a, sort of,

603
00:49:38,368 --> 00:49:40,162
uh, cataleptic state,

604
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:43,665
during which
they can be destroyed
by two different means.

605
00:49:43,749 --> 00:49:46,919
At night, however,
they are invulnerable.

606
00:49:47,044 --> 00:49:48,754
You mean you actually believe

607
00:49:48,837 --> 00:49:51,131
that Frank shot
through Alucard
without hurting him?

608
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:55,677
Bullets would have
had no effect on him.

609
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:58,847
Well,
it's strange to hear a man
of science like yourself

610
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:03,519
calmly admit that
he believes in
a superstition so fantastic.

611
00:50:03,602 --> 00:50:05,479
I could spend
days citing proof

612
00:50:05,562 --> 00:50:08,232
that it is not
mere superstition.

613
00:50:08,315 --> 00:50:11,818
My own homeland in
the Carpathian Hills,
where Count Dracula lived,

614
00:50:11,985 --> 00:50:14,863
is sad testimony to its truth.

615
00:50:14,947 --> 00:50:19,868
What was once a happy,
productive region,
is today, barren waste.

616
00:50:19,952 --> 00:50:23,539
Villages depopulated,
the land abandoned.

617
00:50:23,664 --> 00:50:26,708
Maybe that's why he left there
and came here to
a younger country,

618
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:28,377
stronger and more virile.

619
00:50:28,502 --> 00:50:30,379
Of course.

620
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:34,174
And he will fasten
on it and drain it dry,
just as he did his homeland.

621
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:37,386
Unless...

622
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:40,514
We can find his grave
and destroy him in it.

623
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,059
His grave?
He was buried in Hungary,
wasn't he?

624
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,645
Yes, but you will find
that one of the chests
he brought

625
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:49,273
contains a layer of soil
from his birthplace.

626
00:50:49,356 --> 00:50:51,400
That constitutes a grave.

627
00:50:51,483 --> 00:50:53,277
Are you serious?

628
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,904
Rest assured
he has it hidden
in some safe place

629
00:50:55,988 --> 00:50:59,658
and returns to it
just before sunrise
every morning.

630
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,160
And our job
seems to be to find

631
00:51:02,244 --> 00:51:04,454
that chest with him
in it, and destroy him.

632
00:51:05,247 --> 00:51:07,624
That won't be as
simple as it sounds.

633
00:51:07,749 --> 00:51:12,296
The vampire can assume
very many different forms
at will.

634
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:16,258
Sometimes,
it appears as a bat,
sometimes, as a werewolf,

635
00:51:16,383 --> 00:51:20,637
and sometimes,
as a small cloud
of swirling vapor.

636
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:23,724
In this way,
it can move unseen
among its enemies,

637
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:27,769
learn their plans
and be in a position
to outwit them.

638
00:51:27,894 --> 00:51:32,441
You are
very brilliant, aren't you,
Professor Lazlo?

639
00:51:32,524 --> 00:51:34,985
Perhaps too brilliant
for your own good,

640
00:51:36,445 --> 00:51:38,530
and that of Dr. Brewster.

641
00:51:40,032 --> 00:51:41,700
You're right.

642
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:45,203
I am here
because this is
a young and virile race,

643
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:48,915
not dry and
decadent like ours.

644
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:51,084
They have what I want,

645
00:51:51,168 --> 00:51:54,421
what I need, what I must have.

646
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:59,217
Do you suppose
that I would allow
any mortal to stand in my way?

647
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:35,462
Here, drink this.

648
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:42,969
Thanks.

649
00:52:43,053 --> 00:52:44,596
This doesn't leave me
much room to go on

650
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,349
disputing your theories,
Professor.

651
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:50,852
How in the world
did you drive him away?

652
00:52:50,936 --> 00:52:52,270
I showed him this.

653
00:52:54,356 --> 00:52:56,108
A simple cross!

654
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:00,028
It would take too long
to explain why
they fear it, but they do.

655
00:53:00,112 --> 00:53:04,366
Keep this and
wear it at all times,
especially in your sleep.

656
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:07,994
Dracula has you
marked for death.

657
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:11,206
Not only me,
but unsuspecting people
in this district,

658
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:14,209
who'd never believe us
if we tried to warn them.

659
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,461
We must find some way
to destroy him

660
00:53:16,545 --> 00:53:17,713
before it's too...

661
00:53:18,004 --> 00:53:21,466
Excuse me, Doctor Harry,
but it's Mrs. Land to see you.

662
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:22,884
Something's happened
to Tommy, Doctor.

663
00:53:22,968 --> 00:53:24,219
Put him here.

664
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,305
I sent him to my sister's
on an errand tonight.

665
00:53:27,389 --> 00:53:29,391
He was gone so long,
I finally went after him.

666
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:32,561
Will you get my bag,
Professor?
Certainly.

667
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:35,021
I found him lying
beside the road,
just like this.

668
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:37,899
He talked a little,
but he didn't make sense.

669
00:53:37,983 --> 00:53:40,360
He acted like
he was scared foolish.

670
00:53:40,444 --> 00:53:43,238
And then he said something
about a foreign man in a fog,

671
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,991
but there wasn't
any fog tonight, Doctor.

672
00:53:47,993 --> 00:53:50,245
I noticed those wounds
on his neck, too.

673
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:52,539
What are they?
Small animal bites?

674
00:53:58,754 --> 00:54:03,091
No, I don't think so.
We can fix that very easily.

675
00:54:14,394 --> 00:54:15,812
Sarah?

676
00:54:15,896 --> 00:54:17,189
Yes, Dr. Harry?

677
00:54:19,149 --> 00:54:21,276
Why don't you make
Mrs. Land a cup of tea?

678
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:22,778
You go along with Sarah,
Mrs. Land.

679
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:23,862
Yes, sir.

680
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:30,285
Tommy's going to be all right.
He's had a bit of a shock.

681
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:32,829
I want him to stay here
until he regains
consciousness.

682
00:54:32,913 --> 00:54:34,748
I'll call you.
Thank you, Doctor.

683
00:54:40,962 --> 00:54:45,008
Dracula's first victim.
It's starting fast.

684
00:54:45,091 --> 00:54:46,802
Tell me, does that mean
that Tommy's in danger

685
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:48,428
of becoming
a vampire himself?

686
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,557
No, unless Alucard drained
so much blood from him,
that he died.

687
00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:55,936
Well, what about Kay?
She died from bullet wounds,

688
00:54:56,019 --> 00:54:58,563
and yet, you implied
that she would
become a vampire.

689
00:54:58,814 --> 00:55:02,442
Yes, but her case
was different.

690
00:55:02,526 --> 00:55:03,485
Her background was...

691
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:05,570
I know, morbid.

692
00:55:05,654 --> 00:55:08,240
She'd gone overboard
on the subject of
the supernatural,

693
00:55:08,323 --> 00:55:09,449
black magic and the like.

694
00:55:09,533 --> 00:55:10,575
Exactly.

695
00:55:10,659 --> 00:55:15,580
And I rather
believe that Miss Caldwell
may have made the transition

696
00:55:15,664 --> 00:55:16,832
from choice.

697
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:19,960
No one could choose
a thing so loathsome!

698
00:55:20,252 --> 00:55:22,170
Don't forget,
the girl was morbid.

699
00:55:22,254 --> 00:55:25,674
That often
means thanatophobia,
fear of death.

700
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:28,593
And Alucard could
promise her eternal life.

701
00:55:28,677 --> 00:55:31,847
Eternal life
at such a price?

702
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,266
Why do you think
she is a vampire?

703
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:37,686
The dirt which I understand
had been thrown
into her grave...

704
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:42,148
Who else would have done that
except Alucard, Dracula?

705
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:44,734
But then that means
we have to destroy her
as well?

706
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,487
That should be
relatively simple.

707
00:55:47,571 --> 00:55:49,281
Her sister could
order her cremation

708
00:55:49,364 --> 00:55:51,867
while the body is
still in the morgue.

709
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:53,451
Perhaps you're right.

710
00:55:59,749 --> 00:56:03,712
Hello. Oh, hello, Claire.
I was just about to call you.

711
00:56:05,046 --> 00:56:07,883
No, I think that'll
be perfectly safe.

712
00:56:07,966 --> 00:56:10,552
Professor Lazlo
and I will stop by
and pick you up.

713
00:56:10,635 --> 00:56:12,095
Oh, it's no trouble.

714
00:56:12,178 --> 00:56:14,764
Besides, there's something
we want to talk to you about.

715
00:56:14,848 --> 00:56:17,183
All right. See you
in a few minutes then.

716
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:20,353
The sheriff's office
just called her.

717
00:56:20,437 --> 00:56:24,274
They say that Frank is
still a bit irrational,
and insists upon seeing her.

718
00:56:24,357 --> 00:56:28,111
While she's there,
she can leave orders
for Katherine's cremation.

719
00:56:31,865 --> 00:56:33,533
Oh, Sarah?

720
00:56:33,617 --> 00:56:34,826
Mrs. Land?

721
00:56:40,332 --> 00:56:42,417
Unfortunately,
I have to run along.

722
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,253
I think in a few minutes,
it'll be perfectly safe
to take Tommy home.

723
00:56:45,337 --> 00:56:47,255
Don't you worry about him.
He's going to be all right.

724
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:48,632
Thank you, Doctor.

725
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,347
Frank?

726
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:25,103
Frank.

727
00:58:31,192 --> 00:58:32,444
Frank?

728
00:58:45,165 --> 00:58:46,332
Kay.

729
00:58:52,672 --> 00:58:54,049
No, it can't be.

730
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:56,176
Yes, Frank, it's Katherine.

731
00:58:56,509 --> 00:58:59,721
No. No, you can't be Kay.

732
00:58:59,804 --> 00:59:03,558
Kay's dead! I know,
I killed her. I saw her fall.

733
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:06,227
I was with the sheriff
when he found her body,
and she was dead.

734
00:59:06,478 --> 00:59:08,188
She was dead! I saw her!

735
00:59:08,271 --> 00:59:10,231
You see me now, too.

736
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:13,193
Yes, but...

737
00:59:13,276 --> 00:59:14,986
Do you doubt
your own eyes?

738
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:22,452
It is you. It is you,
Kay, and you're alive!

739
00:59:25,371 --> 00:59:29,250
But what is it, Kay?
You seem to be cold,
like death.

740
00:59:29,334 --> 00:59:30,627
You seem to be Kay,

741
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,003
but there's
a strange difference.

742
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:34,631
It's almost as if
I didn't know you.

743
00:59:34,714 --> 00:59:36,633
Does that mean
you no longer love me?

744
00:59:36,716 --> 00:59:37,759
I'll always love you.

745
00:59:37,842 --> 00:59:39,969
Enough to spend
the rest of your life
with me?

746
00:59:40,053 --> 00:59:41,054
But...

747
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,266
But you're married, Kay,
you're married to Alucard.

748
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:48,394
I don't love him, Frank.
I never did.

749
00:59:48,478 --> 00:59:49,896
But you're married to him!

750
00:59:49,979 --> 00:59:51,606
I had to, Frank.

751
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:55,068
It was part of the plan
I told you about
in the garden.

752
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:57,237
I asked you to
have faith in me then.

753
00:59:57,529 --> 00:59:59,531
I beg you to have
faith in me now.

754
01:00:01,866 --> 01:00:03,785
I don't understand.

755
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:06,079
Count Alucard
is immortal.

756
01:00:06,412 --> 01:00:09,040
Through him,
I attained immortality.

757
01:00:09,124 --> 01:00:11,793
Through me,
you will do the same,

758
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:14,337
and we will spend
eternity together.

759
01:00:15,421 --> 01:00:17,382
Are you serious?

760
01:00:17,465 --> 01:00:19,634
Do you expect me to believe
anything so unreal?

761
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:21,678
How else can you
explain the fact

762
01:00:21,761 --> 01:00:24,389
you shot through him
without hurting him?

763
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:26,224
How else could I be here?

764
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:30,562
Why, I can't explain it.

765
01:00:31,855 --> 01:00:34,149
It's so incredible!

766
01:00:34,232 --> 01:00:36,276
Perhaps you'll understand
when I tell you

767
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:39,320
Count Alucard's real name
is Count Dracula.

768
01:00:43,158 --> 01:00:45,368
Count Dracula?

769
01:00:45,451 --> 01:00:47,453
You mean the Hungarian
who's supposed
to have become...

770
01:00:47,537 --> 01:00:50,415
Don't use that word, Frank.
We don't like it.

771
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,670
Say, rather,
that we are "undead."

772
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:57,130
"Immortal."

773
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,391
Do you mean
you deliberately planned this?

774
01:01:08,474 --> 01:01:10,185
You married him
so you could become a...

775
01:01:10,268 --> 01:01:14,189
So you and I could
attain immortality, yes.

776
01:01:14,272 --> 01:01:16,357
But even if
it would work,

777
01:01:16,441 --> 01:01:19,694
do you expect me
to agree to anything
so fantastic?

778
01:01:19,777 --> 01:01:22,197
You have no choice.

779
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,825
I've taken the first step
while you were sleeping.

780
01:01:29,913 --> 01:01:33,166
No. No, I can't do it.

781
01:01:33,249 --> 01:01:36,794
I've already told you,
you have no choice.

782
01:01:39,422 --> 01:01:44,636
Frank, isn't eternity together
better than a few years
of ordinary life?

783
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:52,602
Yes.
Yes, I suppose it is.

784
01:01:58,441 --> 01:02:02,654
There's one thing
you must do while you're still
in your present form.

785
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:07,325
What is that?
Destroy Dracula.

786
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:09,577
Destroy Dracula?

787
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:12,664
But how?

788
01:02:13,957 --> 01:02:17,168
There is one advantage
all humans have over us.

789
01:02:17,252 --> 01:02:20,672
You can move about
in the daytime. We can't.

790
01:02:20,755 --> 01:02:24,509
We must return to
our graves before sunrise,
or we're destroyed.

791
01:02:26,594 --> 01:02:28,680
But how can I keep him
from his grave?

792
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:34,519
You don't have to.

793
01:02:34,602 --> 01:02:37,647
You can destroy him
in one of two ways.

794
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,024
Either drive a stake
through his heart,

795
01:02:40,108 --> 01:02:42,360
or burn his grave
before he reaches it.

796
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:47,031
You must do this,
Frank, for us.

797
01:02:50,368 --> 01:02:51,661
Well,
Miss Caldwell!

798
01:02:51,744 --> 01:02:53,913
It got so late,
I didn't think you were
coming in tonight.

799
01:02:53,997 --> 01:02:55,123
Oh, I thought you
might have told Frank,

800
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:57,625
and I didn't want
to disappoint him.

801
01:02:57,709 --> 01:02:59,585
I don't suppose
we're allowed
to see him, too?

802
01:02:59,669 --> 01:03:01,379
Sheriff says no.

803
01:03:02,338 --> 01:03:06,592
Find out if he knows
where Count Alucard
keeps himself during the day.

804
01:03:06,676 --> 01:03:08,219
I'll try.

805
01:03:11,055 --> 01:03:12,557
Third one on your left.

806
01:03:19,397 --> 01:03:20,565
Hello, Frank.

807
01:03:20,648 --> 01:03:22,358
Hello, Claire.

808
01:03:22,442 --> 01:03:25,403
It's nice of you to
come after everything.

809
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:28,281
I can only stay
a few minutes. I...

810
01:03:28,364 --> 01:03:31,451
I just wanted to tell you
that I know it was
an accident.

811
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:33,995
That makes me feel better.

812
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:36,831
Kay understands, too.

813
01:03:37,832 --> 01:03:40,501
I'm sure she does.

814
01:03:40,585 --> 01:03:42,545
Oh, I know it,
I know it, because she...

815
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:48,843
Would you think
I was losing my mind
if I told you

816
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:51,179
that Kay has been here
to talk to me?

817
01:03:52,805 --> 01:03:55,183
Oh, I'd be more likely to say
you'd been dreaming.

818
01:03:55,767 --> 01:04:00,438
Yes,
yes, I guess you're right.
I was dreaming.

819
01:04:01,647 --> 01:04:05,526
You know,
they'll never convict
Stanley of that killing.

820
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,487
No?
 No.

821
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:09,280
He's as nutty
as a filbert.

822
01:04:09,364 --> 01:04:10,365
He's been back there
for a long time,

823
01:04:10,448 --> 01:04:13,117
talking to some dame
who wasn't there.

824
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:17,038
First, he talks in his voice,
then he answers in
the woman's voice.

825
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:20,833
Did you... Did you hear
anything that was said?

826
01:04:20,917 --> 01:04:23,836
That'd be a swell way
to spend a rainy evening.

827
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,923
Eavesdropping on some goof
talking to himself
in two voices.

828
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:29,801
Some fun!

829
01:04:31,219 --> 01:04:34,055
Dr. Brewster's doing
all he can for you, Frank.

830
01:04:34,138 --> 01:04:37,433
All he can do is
get me out of here
on an insanity plea.

831
01:04:37,517 --> 01:04:39,394
That shouldn't be hard.

832
01:04:39,477 --> 01:04:40,561
You mustn't even
think such things.

833
01:04:40,645 --> 01:04:41,646
Why not?

834
01:04:42,063 --> 01:04:45,608
I can't be sane.
I really believe
Kay came here to talk to me.

835
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:47,110
If that's not crazy, then I...

836
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:49,946
When are they going
to hold the funeral?

837
01:04:50,029 --> 01:04:52,490
We haven't been
able to contact
Count Alucard so far.

838
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:57,412
Do you happen to know
where he stays during the day?

839
01:04:58,371 --> 01:05:00,081
Why during the day?

840
01:05:00,164 --> 01:05:04,836
It's an unpleasant trip
out there at night,
and there's no phone.

841
01:05:04,919 --> 01:05:07,296
Why should anyone
think I know?

842
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,590
Well, you said
you saw him meet Kay
on the road once,

843
01:05:09,674 --> 01:05:12,677
and I wondered
if you saw where he came from.

844
01:05:14,429 --> 01:05:16,848
I'm sorry.
I don't know anything.

845
01:05:17,932 --> 01:05:20,184
I suppose you'll be
burying her at Dark Oaks?

846
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:21,936
Yes, I think so.

847
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:24,605
At least her ashes
will be taken there.

848
01:05:26,649 --> 01:05:27,817
Her ashes?

849
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,402
Yes.

850
01:05:29,485 --> 01:05:32,155
I'm going to leave
an order for her cremation.

851
01:05:32,238 --> 01:05:33,614
But you can't do that.

852
01:05:33,906 --> 01:05:36,576
You can't do that, I tell you!
She isn't dead, I know!

853
01:05:36,742 --> 01:05:37,952
She came here
and talked to me!

854
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:40,037
You can't cremate her,
she isn't dead!
It would kill her!

855
01:05:40,121 --> 01:05:42,081
I won't let you burn her
now that she's immortal!

856
01:05:42,165 --> 01:05:43,833
You mustn't
excite yourself this way.

857
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:46,377
You've got to
reconcile yourself to
the fact that Kay is dead.

858
01:05:46,461 --> 01:05:47,503
But she isn't!
I know...

859
01:05:47,587 --> 01:05:48,588
I know she isn't dead!

860
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:49,881
Stanley, let her go!

861
01:05:49,964 --> 01:05:50,965
But she isn't dead,
I tell you!

862
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,967
All right, Frank.

863
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,136
I think you'd better leave,
Miss Caldwell.

864
01:05:55,219 --> 01:05:56,471
But you must
listen to me.

865
01:05:56,554 --> 01:05:59,098
Frank,
try and get some sleep.

866
01:06:00,391 --> 01:06:02,310
Good night, Frank.

867
01:06:17,867 --> 01:06:19,327
Kay?

868
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:21,746
Kay!

869
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:26,792
Did you hear what she said?
They're going to cremate you.

870
01:06:26,876 --> 01:06:30,755
Yes, I heard. That means
Dr. Brewster has guessed
the truth.

871
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:32,965
We may have to
eliminate him and Claire.

872
01:06:33,049 --> 01:06:35,343
Oh, no. No,
not your own sister.

873
01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:38,429
She's no longer my sister
when she interferes with me.

874
01:06:38,596 --> 01:06:39,889
But if they cremate you...

875
01:06:39,972 --> 01:06:41,516
They won't find me.

876
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,768
I'll go to Dark Oaks tonight.

877
01:06:43,851 --> 01:06:47,647
But we'll never be safe
as long as Dr. Brewster's
alive.

878
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:49,273
Our first worry's Alucard.

879
01:06:49,357 --> 01:06:51,567
If I could get out of here,
I'd start hunting for him.

880
01:06:51,651 --> 01:06:55,029
I'll get you out,
but you won't have
to hunt for Alucard.

881
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:57,198
I know where he can
be found in the daytime.

882
01:06:57,281 --> 01:06:58,282
Where?

883
01:06:58,366 --> 01:07:01,369
Remember
the old drainage flume
near the edge of the swamp?

884
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:02,537
Yes.

885
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,080
That's the place.

886
01:07:04,163 --> 01:07:05,331
But be sure
you don't get there

887
01:07:05,456 --> 01:07:07,250
until after
the sun is up.

888
01:07:16,092 --> 01:07:17,969
Didn't I tell you
to get some sleep?

889
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:22,139
I couldn't go to sleep.
I was talking to someone.

890
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:29,730
Yeah.

891
01:07:29,814 --> 01:07:33,818
Well, she's gone now,
so, I'll just douse
the lights.

892
01:07:50,543 --> 01:07:52,211
I'll wait for you
at Dark Oaks,

893
01:07:52,295 --> 01:07:55,506
in the playroom
Claire and I used
to have in the attic.

894
01:07:57,008 --> 01:07:59,468
I'll unlock the cell
and bring you a gun.

895
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:18,446
There is very little doubt
in my mind

896
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:21,032
that Kay has
visited Frank in his cell,

897
01:08:21,991 --> 01:08:24,827
and I'm afraid for one
very definite purpose.

898
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,829
What purpose?

899
01:08:26,912 --> 01:08:30,791
Didn't you tell me
that she and Frank
have always been in love?

900
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:33,753
Ever since
they were children. Why?

901
01:08:33,836 --> 01:08:38,799
Well,
it's an unpleasant thought,
but there are cases on record

902
01:08:38,883 --> 01:08:42,803
where the living
have voluntarily joined
the ranks of the undead

903
01:08:42,887 --> 01:08:47,308
in order to consummate
what might be called
an "unholy alliance."

904
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:49,560
You can't be serious,
Professor.

905
01:08:49,644 --> 01:08:52,313
Why, such a pact
between Kay and Frank
is unthinkable!

906
01:08:52,396 --> 01:08:54,231
Perhaps.

907
01:08:54,315 --> 01:08:57,443
But so long as there is even
the remotest possibility,

908
01:08:57,526 --> 01:08:59,654
and I insist there is,

909
01:08:59,737 --> 01:09:02,823
we must arrange
for immediate cremation.

910
01:09:02,907 --> 01:09:06,035
Otherwise, she will destroy
her own soul and Frank's.

911
01:09:18,923 --> 01:09:19,882
Frank!

912
01:09:19,965 --> 01:09:21,967
Get back!
Stay away from me.

913
01:09:22,051 --> 01:09:24,220
Stay away from me!

914
01:09:24,303 --> 01:09:26,263
Frank! Frank Stanley!

915
01:09:28,391 --> 01:09:30,393
What happened?
Frank Stanley just escaped!

916
01:09:30,476 --> 01:09:31,477
Look out for him,
he's armed.

917
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,771
Get after him! But if
you have to shoot, do it!

918
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:49,537
What happened, Mack?
How'd he get out?

919
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:53,958
I don't know, Sheriff.
The keys were on
the desk as usual.

920
01:09:54,041 --> 01:09:57,795
And now they're gone,
and so is Stanley.
I tried to stop him, but...

921
01:09:57,878 --> 01:10:00,172
Did you have anything
to do with this break,
Dr. Brewster?

922
01:10:00,256 --> 01:10:01,298
Certainly not!

923
01:10:01,382 --> 01:10:03,592
We are as anxious as you are
to keep him locked up.

924
01:10:03,676 --> 01:10:05,052
More so.

925
01:10:05,136 --> 01:10:07,722
Did you hear him
do any more talking
to that girl?

926
01:10:07,805 --> 01:10:08,806
What girl?

927
01:10:08,889 --> 01:10:10,057
Katherine Caldwell.

928
01:10:10,141 --> 01:10:11,726
Katherine Cald...

929
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:14,729
Oh, it's some kind of
a crazy trick Stanley pulls.

930
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:16,731
He pretends to be
talking to some girl.

931
01:10:16,814 --> 01:10:18,691
First in his voice,
then in hers.

932
01:10:18,774 --> 01:10:21,485
What is this,
some trick you put him up to
so he'd sound crazy?

933
01:10:21,569 --> 01:10:23,404
Did you listen in
as we asked you to?

934
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,488
Yeah.

935
01:10:24,572 --> 01:10:26,407
But it was too crazy
to bother about.

936
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:27,616
For instance?

937
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,746
Well, the girl's voice
said something about
getting him out of jail.

938
01:10:31,829 --> 01:10:35,040
That wasn't
so crazy, was it? He's out.

939
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:36,709
That's right.

940
01:10:38,544 --> 01:10:40,963
Hey, I never thought of that.

941
01:10:41,046 --> 01:10:42,923
Do you really think
there was someone
in there with him?

942
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:46,635
Never mind that.
What else did he say,
however crazy it was?

943
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,472
Well, she said something
about meeting him

944
01:10:49,555 --> 01:10:52,600
at Dark Oaks,
in some kid playroom.

945
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:54,185
I know where it is.
What else?

946
01:10:54,643 --> 01:10:58,481
Oh, some crazy stuff
about killing Count Alucard.

947
01:10:58,689 --> 01:11:02,443
Did he say "kill him,"
or "destroy him"?

948
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:07,615
Come to think of it,
I believe he did say
"destroy".

949
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:08,699
Uh...

950
01:11:08,783 --> 01:11:11,160
"Shove a stake through him,"
or something.

951
01:11:11,243 --> 01:11:12,411
"Shove a stake through him"?

952
01:11:12,495 --> 01:11:13,537
Yeah.

953
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:15,080
We're dealing with a madman.

954
01:11:15,164 --> 01:11:17,082
Obviously.

955
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:19,168
Did he say anything
that would give us an idea

956
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:21,170
of where he expected
to find Count Alucard?

957
01:11:21,253 --> 01:11:23,631
Yeah, but that really
was crazy.

958
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:26,467
She said
something about a swamp
with a drainage tunnel...

959
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,385
I know
where that is, too.
Good.

960
01:11:28,469 --> 01:11:31,138
We'll get right out there,
and warn Alucard
before Frank gets there.

961
01:11:31,222 --> 01:11:34,391
You'll not warn him
if we have to lock you up
in your own jail.

962
01:11:34,475 --> 01:11:35,643
What's that?

963
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:37,478
There's a lot to this
you don't understand,
Sheriff.

964
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:38,896
If you doubt it,
just let's go over

965
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:40,189
and take a look
in that morgue.

966
01:11:40,272 --> 01:11:41,857
What's the morgue
got to do with it?

967
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:43,234
Oh, never mind.

968
01:11:43,317 --> 01:11:45,778
It's all becoming
as plain as day, Professor.

969
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:47,446
It has been to me
for some time.

970
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,990
Well, then let's go take
a look at that morgue.

971
01:11:50,074 --> 01:11:51,116
Okay.

972
01:12:00,251 --> 01:12:02,586
The coffin is gone,
corpse and all!

973
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:03,754
Of course.

974
01:12:04,839 --> 01:12:06,799
You sound as if
you expected it.

975
01:12:06,882 --> 01:12:08,384
We did.

976
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:09,718
What's your part
in all this?

977
01:12:09,802 --> 01:12:11,512
How do you know in advance
what's happening?

978
01:12:11,595 --> 01:12:13,514
We'd better get out
to where Alucard is hiding.

979
01:12:13,597 --> 01:12:15,432
We'll try to explain it
to you on the way.

980
01:12:15,516 --> 01:12:17,852
I thought you weren't
going to warn Alucard
about Frank.

981
01:12:17,935 --> 01:12:19,061
We're not.

982
01:12:19,144 --> 01:12:22,731
But we may have to save Frank
from the Count, and from
his own madness.

983
01:12:22,815 --> 01:12:25,484
Gentlemen, the farther we go,
the crazier you sound.

984
01:13:27,546 --> 01:13:28,797
Well.

985
01:13:29,381 --> 01:13:32,593
It is seldom
that my enemies
are so accommodating.

986
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:34,803
How did you learn
where to find me?

987
01:13:35,137 --> 01:13:36,931
I know all about you.

988
01:13:37,014 --> 01:13:39,266
You're not Count Alucard,
but Count Dracula,

989
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:41,977
one of the undead,
a loathsome thing,

990
01:13:42,061 --> 01:13:43,646
surviving on
the blood of the living.

991
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:47,441
Well,
there'll be no more blood
of the living for you,

992
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:49,360
because I'm going
to destroy you.

993
01:13:49,944 --> 01:13:52,613
If you had
learned more about me,

994
01:13:52,696 --> 01:13:55,449
you wouldn't have come here
until after sunrise.

995
01:13:55,783 --> 01:13:59,703
Now, it is not I that
is going to be destroyed.

996
01:14:33,278 --> 01:14:34,863
Put it out!

997
01:14:36,323 --> 01:14:38,075
Put it out, do you hear me?

998
01:14:40,285 --> 01:14:41,620
Put it out!

999
01:14:42,955 --> 01:14:44,456
Put it out!

1000
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:58,921
Put it out!

1001
01:16:46,745 --> 01:16:49,039
You stay here, Jack.

1002
01:16:57,047 --> 01:16:59,591
This is one thing
we didn't foresee, Doctor.

1003
01:16:59,675 --> 01:17:00,634
How could we?

1004
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:02,136
I don't get it.
What's happened?

1005
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:04,638
To maintain his existence
among the undead,

1006
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:08,267
Dracula had to be
back in his coffin
before sunrise.

1007
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:11,103
Frank prevented it,
as you can see.

1008
01:17:14,523 --> 01:17:16,984
You mean, that's all
that's left of Alucard?

1009
01:17:17,067 --> 01:17:18,986
Look at the ring
on his hand.

1010
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:22,823
It bears the Alucard seal,
just as on his luggage.

1011
01:17:22,906 --> 01:17:26,034
Well, assuming it is Alucard,
or Dracula, or whoever
he calls himself,

1012
01:17:26,118 --> 01:17:29,413
where is Frank Stanley?
He's still wanted for murder.

1013
01:17:29,496 --> 01:17:32,833
Do you still think
that Frank killed Kay
deliberately?

1014
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:36,044
Look, Doctor,
I'm only the sheriff.
I'm not the judge.

1015
01:17:36,128 --> 01:17:38,839
It's my job to bring him in,
and the court to decide
he's guilty.

1016
01:17:38,922 --> 01:17:40,674
Of course, but I think
our testimony

1017
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:42,301
will have some bearing
on their decision.

1018
01:17:42,384 --> 01:17:43,510
Undoubtedly.

1019
01:17:43,594 --> 01:17:46,263
But the main thing
to do now is
to find Frank,

1020
01:17:46,346 --> 01:17:54,346
and I think I know
where he is.
