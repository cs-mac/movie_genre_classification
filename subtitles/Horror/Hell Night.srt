1
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,511
Hi.

2
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,477
I'm Peter Bennett, president
of Alpha Sigma Rho.

3
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,597
Are you one of our sorority sisters?

4
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:29,768
Who do you think I am,

5
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,141
your fairy godmother?

6
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:31,982
No.

7
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,648
But you're certainly everything
I could've wished for.

8
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,521
Peter, everything's all set up.

9
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,942
Wonderful, Scott.

10
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,906
You're in your big brother fraternity,

11
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,118
don't you think you ought
to show a little respect?

12
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,658
I'm showing more than respect, honey.

13
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,166
- Listen, why don't you
and I go on upstairs

14
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,785
and exchange phone numbers?

15
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,786
Scott?

16
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,413
Take over, will you?

17
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,499
Hey, who's she?

18
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,754
Oh, that's one of the new pledges.

19
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,346
They call her Marti.

20
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,558
- So who is the Zorro
impersonator in the purple cape

21
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,681
at the bar staring at me?

22
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,606
- That's Peter Bennett, president
of the fraternity house.

23
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,359
He lives all year for Hell Night.

24
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:22,283
This is when he really
puts it to the pledges.

25
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,117
Can I resign now?

26
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,578
No, you don't.

27
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,991
We got a deal.

28
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,661
I've already given you the
best room in the house,

29
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,627
not to mention the car and the clothes.

30
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,746
You're not quitting now.

31
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,463
Mingle, dear, mingle.

32
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,350
Thanks, little doll.

33
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,518
Yes-siree Bob.

34
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,319
Look what just walked in.

35
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,408
Not my type.

36
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,577
See that?

37
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,299
That's my type.

38
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,390
Hey Peter, isn't it about time

39
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,141
you start the initiation?

40
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,064
Nah, it's still early.

41
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,062
Look at Sicowski!

42
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,439
He hasn't even barfed
on the trophy case yet.

43
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,193
And the front windows still aren't broken.

44
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,995
Well, I guess it's time to
get this show on the road!

45
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,708
- Alright!
- Let's go!

46
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,804
Quiet!

47
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,789
Welcome to Garth Manor.

48
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,646
In order to be a member
of Alpha Sigma Rho,

49
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,481
one has to do what?

50
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,224
Mr. Reed?

51
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,942
- To stay in Garth Manor
one night, Mr. President.

52
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,065
Very good, Jeff.

53
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,442
And why is this night so special?

54
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,819
Ms. Dunsmore?

55
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,240
Because 12 years ago,

56
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,079
Raymond Garth murdered his family here

57
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,744
and then committed suicide!

58
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,037
And is there something funny

59
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,455
about a man murdering his family

60
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,249
and then killing himself?

61
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,747
I'm just a little tipsy.

62
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,919
- I hope you
didn't bring any other

63
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,588
intoxicants in here with you.

64
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,926
Oh, of course not!

65
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,263
Well, just to make sure,

66
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,475
I'll have to personally
search you before we leave.

67
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,514
It'd be a pleasure.

68
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,306
Shall we go?

69
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,480
In 1850, Virgil Garth built this mansion

70
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,949
with the gold that was
pouring out of his mines.

71
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,285
Since then, four generations
of Garths have lived here,

72
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,370
until 12 years ago.

73
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,864
The last people to live in the house

74
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,662
were Raymond and Lillian
Garth, and their four children.

75
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,161
Now, Lillian Garth was
a hopeless simpleton.

76
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,584
About the only thing she was
good for was childbearing,

77
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,253
and she didn't turn out
to be too hot at that.

78
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,751
First child she bore Raymond was a boy.

79
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,550
A mongoloid boy they called Morris.

80
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,764
Now, Morris brought great
sorrow to the Garths,

81
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,100
and they immediately set
about to have another child,

82
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,892
and they were soon cursed
with a baby girl, Suzanne.

83
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,890
Now, she was so hideously deformed,

84
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,892
that it was impossible to
tell from looking at her

85
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,565
if she was male or female!

86
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,608
And to her father's immense disgust,

87
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,732
she used to drag herself around the house

88
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,485
with the help of her one good leg.

89
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,907
Now, the Garths were very
fanatical about their privacy.

90
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,000
They didn't want to have to
be dependent on anyone else,

91
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,336
so they isolated themselves up here.

92
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,921
That is why they never put
in any modern utilities.

93
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:32,009
There's no gas, no
electricity, and no phone.

94
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,095
So, again, they tried to have a child,

95
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,215
and within the year the
Garths added Margret.

96
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,342
But unfortunately, it soon became apparent

97
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,890
that poor little Margret
could neither hear,

98
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,183
nor speak, nor see.

99
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,227
But good old Ray was determined,

100
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,317
and he decided to have one last go.

101
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,902
So Lillian got pregnant again.

102
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,613
She carried the child
for 10 and a half months,

103
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,235
until finally she delivered
a little gork named Andrew.

104
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,864
Andrew never spoke a word
in his first 14 years.

105
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,957
He just made these grunts and groans,

106
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,326
like the sounds of wild animals.

107
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,453
Now, Raymond Garth lived
isolated in this house

108
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,831
for 14 years with this freak show,

109
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,878
until he couldn't stand it any more.

110
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,754
12 years ago, he assembled the
entire family in the parlor,

111
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,972
and then he took his dear wife, Lillian,

112
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,715
and he strangled her to death.

113
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,217
Then he took the mongoloid son Morris

114
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,310
and he bashed out what
little brains he had

115
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,475
with the fireplace poker.

116
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,098
Then he took the deformed little Suzanne

117
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,896
and he impaled her with the same poker.

118
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,566
Then he took the deaf, dumb,
and blind little Margret,

119
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,404
and he slit her throat.

120
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,904
And then Raymond Garth got a rope

121
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,868
and hung himself to death.

122
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,456
Leaving the cruelest punishment of all

123
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,376
to his 14 year old gorked-out son, Andrew,

124
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,169
who was forced to witness the slaughter

125
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,883
of his entire family.

126
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,843
Now, when the police arrived,

127
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,806
they discovered a note
written by Raymond Garth

128
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,429
describing the entire gruesome act.

129
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,599
But strangely,

130
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,441
they only discovered three dead bodies.

131
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,436
And young Andrew was nowhere to be found.

132
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,359
Well, they search the house
as thoroughly as they could,

133
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,825
but still only came up with three corpses.

134
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,198
Andrew...

135
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,619
Andrew is still believed by some

136
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,210
to be living somewhere within this house.

137
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,189
Come in!

138
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,672
Now...

139
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,713
You four may sleep anywhere
you want in the house.

140
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,178
Either separately or otherwise.

141
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:26,934
But remember, you may not leave
the confines of the estate.

142
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,723
That shouldn't be too hard.

143
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,350
You'll find the gate is virtually
impossible to climb over.

144
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,440
Any questions?

145
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,057
Now, the only way out of Garth Manor

146
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,056
is to shoot your way out.

147
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,934
Don't use it unless you have to.

148
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,529
And don't try climbing the fence.

149
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,272
You might cut your nuts off.

150
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,534
See you four at dawn.

151
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,160
Just about six hours.

152
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:31,953
Have fun.

153
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,789
Wow, this place is pretty radical.

154
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,499
It is that.

155
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,494
- You know, this would be
a hot place to go hunting.

156
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,335
Hunting?

157
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,704
Ugh, I hate guns!

158
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,048
- Yeah, but sometimes
they come in pretty handy.

159
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,712
Like one summer I was camping out

160
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,835
on the north shore of Oahu,

161
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,131
and these locals used
to come by every night

162
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,470
and beat the crap out of us, you know?

163
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,839
So listen to this, one day, we go down,

164
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,887
we buy ourselves a shotgun.

165
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,929
Go down to the local bar,

166
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,474
and really put the fear of God into them.

167
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,564
Needless to say, we didn't have
too many hassles after that.

168
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,774
So you guys really believe this story

169
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,395
about old Raymond Garth and
gorked-out Andrew and all that?

170
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,397
No, Peter's full of shit.

171
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,945
- Actually, I think there's
some truth to that story.

172
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,783
That guy Garth did kill his family here.

173
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,822
Oh, is that right?

174
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,819
Well let me tell you,

175
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,413
find me a little gork in
there tonight named Garth.

176
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,624
I'm gonna ask him for an
extra pair of long underwear,

177
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,867
because it's getting as cold

178
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,915
as a hound's pecker in December out here.

179
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,662
I'll keep you warm, Wes.

180
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,005
The name is Seth,

181
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,715
and you've got a date,
you little beach bunny.

182
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,453
Hey, let's party!

183
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,329
Alright!

184
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,376
Quaaludes.

185
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,090
Lookie here!

186
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,254
And Jack Daniel's.

187
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,671
Okay!

188
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,386
- You sure caught onto the
American lifestyle fast.

189
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,847
And...

190
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,714
Music.

191
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,217
Oh my gosh.

192
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,345
This is one radical chick!

193
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,555
Alright!

194
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,480
- I thought Peter was supposed
to search you before he left.

195
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,443
He did, and he took half an ounce

196
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,812
of excellent Columbian from me,

197
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,234
and half a gram of coke.

198
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,527
- Please don't tell me
where he found them,

199
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,526
I'll just get so jealous.

200
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,697
Don't be jealous, love.

201
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,161
There's plenty for everybody.

202
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,057
Last call from the bar.

203
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:09,376
I don't think it's gonna
get much cozier than this.

204
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,422
So you live around here?

205
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,637
Yeah, around here.

206
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,090
Where around here?

207
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,514
Hillsdown.

208
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,679
Oh, so rich.

209
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,435
- You say that
like I have a disease.

210
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,983
What's it like to be so rich?

211
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,492
- You see, that's why I never
tell anybody where I'm from.

212
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,236
Yeah, but shouldn't your name be

213
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,455
Bentley Rhasmus Fairchild
the third or fourth,

214
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,324
or something like that?

215
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,036
What makes it so evil to be rich,

216
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,959
and so noble to be poor?

217
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,838
It's just that the rich capitalist

218
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,303
feeds on the life of the downtrodden poor.

219
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,681
Figures, a radical.

220
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,346
Probably majoring in political science

221
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,562
with an emphasis on terrorism?

222
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:08,150
- No, actually I don't
give a darn about politics.

223
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:13,113
I'm beginning not to give a
darn about sororities either.

224
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,610
You silly bastard.

225
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,044
Hey!

226
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,167
Robin Hood to the rescue!

227
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,167
Come on you little...

228
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,009
Hang on!

229
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,799
Is that all you're after?

230
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:37,762
Huh?

231
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,051
Is that all you're interested in, sex?

232
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,265
What are you talking about?

233
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,011
- I mean, don't you do
anything but drink and screw?

234
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,807
Yeah, I surf.

235
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:46,396
I surf, drink, and screw.

236
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,107
Well, there's something, then.

237
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,726
Tell me what it's like to surf.

238
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,978
Boy, you are some buzzy chick.

239
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,525
I mean, first you're all
hot to get me up here,

240
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:55,943
and now you want to talk?

241
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,907
We'll get to that later!

242
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,822
First tell me what it's like to surf.

243
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,742
Well, it's like the ultimate rush.

244
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,658
Paddling out...

245
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,877
The winds are blowing offshore.

246
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,423
Four to six foot swells are rolling in.

247
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,835
And I'm riding my most radical stick,

248
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,303
an 18 inch pinner-gun.

249
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,673
18 inches, oh my goodness!

250
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,514
All of a sudden,

251
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,975
a perfect six footer starts towards me.

252
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,685
I turn around, two, three strokes,

253
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,849
and I'm dropping in!

254
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:27,892
Two or three strokes?

255
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,979
That didn't take long.

256
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,064
And just as I hit the bottom,

257
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,433
I throw the most radical bottom turn

258
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,730
straight up the face,

259
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,729
hit the lip so hard I do a layback!

260
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,105
Now you're talking!

261
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,323
- I get back down the
wave, get completely tubed,

262
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,238
totally surrounded by
water for an instant,

263
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,360
and then what do I do?

264
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,702
I kick out!

265
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,989
Sounds wonderful.

266
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,036
It is.

267
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:47,999
Now if you behave,

268
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,288
maybe I'll take you
surfing again sometime!

269
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:20,820
Dammit, Scott!

270
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,283
Not so much noise!

271
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,346
Shh!

272
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,093
Alright.

273
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,774
Alright, you guys go
on up to the north side

274
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:55,984
and set things up.

275
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,272
I'll go the other way.

276
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,645
And keep out of sight!

277
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,363
Now the fun begins.

278
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,078
What are you doing here anyway?

279
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,290
- You'll have to ask my
father that question.

280
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,633
Why do you say that?

281
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,547
Because...

282
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,594
He's the one that wanted
me to join Alpha Sigma Rho.

283
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,807
Why?

284
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,143
Because he was one.

285
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:34,265
It builds relationships
you'll have your whole life.

286
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,935
And what kind of man is your father?

287
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,312
- He's kinda like the father
on Leave It To Beaver.

288
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,530
Just hangs around the
house in his sweater.

289
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,820
Doesn't seem to go to work that much.

290
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,318
I don't meet too many guys

291
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,492
who do what their fathers want them to do.

292
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,114
I think that's nice.

293
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:53,867
No.

294
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,417
You just don't meet
many guys who admit it.

295
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,438
Come on!

296
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,371
So now you know why I'm here.

297
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,868
What's your excuse?

298
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,289
I don't know.

299
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,586
Seemed like the thing to do at the time.

300
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,505
All my friends are joining sororities.

301
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,630
- Smart girl like you
giving into peer pressure?

302
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,380
No.

303
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,427
Actually, I didn't make out so bad.

304
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,225
I made a deal with May, the
president of the sorority.

305
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,474
If I supply all the english lit notes,

306
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,192
I get any room in the house, free clothes,

307
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,313
and a car to toodle around in.

308
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,814
The car's not so bad.

309
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,487
I had to a little bit
of work on the brakes,

310
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,782
and the shoes are okay, so it works great.

311
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,576
- Wait a second, you
replaced the brakes yourself?

312
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,164
Yeah.

313
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,501
Where'd you learn to do that?

314
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,837
My father owns a garage,

315
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,379
and I worked in it all
through high school.

316
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:30,055
- You know, my car's been
making these pained noises.

317
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,218
I think it's the valves...

318
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:35,344
- Now you know why I don't
tell anybody I'm a mechanic.

319
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,187
Ow!

320
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,230
Shh!

321
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,149
What the hell is this hole?

322
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,864
It's ventilation for under the house.

323
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,109
There's all sorts of secret rooms

324
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,826
and tunnels running underneath there.

325
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:55,948
There's a bunch of these vents
all around the outer wall.

326
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:58,993
Look, don't go underneath the house,

327
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,210
I've got it all wired up.

328
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,748
Besides, it's a mess down there.

329
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,088
You might get lost in one of the tunnels.

330
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,332
Gee, thanks a lot Scott,

331
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,878
I was just about to slip under there

332
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,047
and grab a quick nap!

333
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,172
Come on, let's get going.

334
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,156
- You're so down on all
this fraternity stuff.

335
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,528
Why are you here?

336
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,448
- I've been wondering
the same thing all night.

337
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,542
It came from upstairs.

338
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,009
What happened?

339
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,395
What are you people screaming about?

340
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,013
We weren't screaming.

341
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,185
Wait a second.

342
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,524
If you weren't screaming,

343
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,392
and we weren't screaming...

344
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,440
Somebody's trying to mind-fuck us.

345
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,313
What happened, Wes?

346
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,776
My name is Seth, darling.

347
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,277
And I don't know, but it looks like

348
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,028
we have a little trick-or-treat
going on around here.

349
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,951
That's coming from the third floor.

350
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:23,827
Let's go.

351
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:00,663
Here it is.

352
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,452
Where?

353
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:06,374
They ran this wire in through the roof.

354
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,370
You got a knife?

355
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,667
No, you got a gun?

356
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,210
Yeah, but it's downstairs, why?

357
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,583
- Well, because if that
thing screams again,

358
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,880
I'm gonna shoot it to death!

359
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,885
It's connected with screws in the back.

360
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,101
I'll try to undo it with my nail.

361
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,812
Did you find anything?

362
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,857
It's alright ladies,

363
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,025
it looks like we've
apprehended the culprit.

364
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,653
Shit.

365
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,406
They must've found it.

366
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,997
Dammit, you scared me.

367
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,711
Shh, keep your voice down!

368
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,000
Nice atmosphere, huh?

369
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:54,126
- Yeah, if you want to scare
the crap out of somebody.

370
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,094
Are we ready yet?

371
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,884
Just about.

372
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,928
Okay May, you go around to the side

373
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,266
and start the diversion.

374
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,851
Why don't you go start the diversion?

375
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,015
Because I want to watch.

376
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,558
Well, I want to watch, too!

377
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,807
May, don't give me a problem.

378
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,309
You'll get your kicks later.

379
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,060
Jesus!

380
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,271
You know, if you guys spent
half the time studying

381
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,023
as you do setting up these stunts,

382
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,868
we'd all be graduating with honors!

383
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,449
What a little twat!

384
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,118
We should've left her behind.

385
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,114
Why?

386
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,582
Her behind is the best part.

387
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,498
We should've kept her behind
and left the rest of her!

388
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,624
- I think they're done
scaring us for the night.

389
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,172
I hope so, but I doubt it.

390
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,842
Maybe they're sneaking
around outside, watching us.

391
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,885
You think so?

392
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,554
Well, what do you think is out there?

393
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,391
Maybe Peter...

394
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,898
Are they gonna do this all night?

395
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:14,891
I hope not.

396
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,235
Wait here, I'll check it out.

397
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,280
Somebody's got some sense of humor.

398
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,781
I can see that.

399
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,250
Come on.

400
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,380
It's coming from in here.

401
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,943
Jeff, is that you?

402
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,313
Okay guys, very scary.

403
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,852
Let's just go home.

404
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,281
Oh, you guys.

405
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,032
Terrific.

406
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,340
May!

407
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,959
Peter!

408
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,835
I'm scared!

409
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,883
Please turn it off!

410
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,748
- Looks like she's been
waiting for you, sport.

411
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:36,741
What happened?

412
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,618
I just had a little trick played on me.

413
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,164
I got locked in there with a ghost.

414
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,333
Did you see somebody?

415
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,753
A walking corpse.

416
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,295
Wow, that sounds very interesting.

417
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,793
You know, I'd like to stay down here

418
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,510
and really help you look
for your little corpse,

419
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,425
but I've got a girl
upstairs who needs my body.

420
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,048
Here you go!

421
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,425
Don't pay any attention to him.

422
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,722
Oh, I'm trying not to.

423
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,812
Show me what happened.

424
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,521
I think that little weasel Scott

425
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,015
had something to do with this.

426
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,642
I'm sure he had some help from Peter.

427
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,188
These are the guys I'm
building relationships

428
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,903
that will last me a lifetime.

429
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,238
Look, anyway, I was sitting over there

430
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,697
and the doors blew open,

431
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,532
and the candles went
out, and I ran over here,

432
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,527
and then these doors shut.

433
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,995
And then I heard this moaning
and groaning behind me,

434
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,330
and I turned around,

435
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,746
and there was the ghost of
Raymond Garth coming at me.

436
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,334
Where'd it come from?

437
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,794
From over there.

438
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,341
Over there.

439
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,563
Now it's time for the old
magical looking glass routine.

440
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,105
- I'm going up to the
roof to start phase two,

441
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,354
physical terror!

442
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,985
You know something, Scott,

443
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,984
I think you enjoy this a little too much.

444
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,806
There's probably a switch or something

445
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,770
controlling those doors.

446
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,432
I found it.

447
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,609
Close the door.

448
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,322
Okay, now try it.

449
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,125
Nothing!

450
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,501
Okay, try it now.

451
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,679
You're right, it opens.

452
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,599
Peter!

453
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:01,807
Scott!

454
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,314
And all the rest of you!

455
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,933
We know you're here!

456
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,152
There's been a lot of laughs,

457
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:14,240
but why don't we just shut the
fun-house off now, alright?

458
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,292
Who's there?

459
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,839
Peter, is that you?

460
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,555
Cut the bullshit, Peter.

461
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,613
I thought you disconnected the screamer.

462
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,982
We did.

463
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,201
- Well then how come I heard
someone screaming a while ago?

464
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,695
- Because they probably
hooked up a bunch of speakers

465
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,742
all over this place.

466
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,412
They want some backup in
case we unhook some of them.

467
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,751
They, who's they?

468
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:13,961
I don't know.

469
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:14,999
Peter.

470
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,417
Scott, Chris.

471
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,792
Some of the other Alpha Sigma Rho people.

472
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,465
This place looks clean.

473
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,226
Except in the closet.

474
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,691
I swear, it's such bullshit.

475
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,936
Don't get mad at me.

476
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:38,732
I'm not.

477
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,192
So is everything okay now?

478
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,407
No more visitors in the closet?

479
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,653
No secret passageways or screamers?

480
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,619
I think so.

481
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,740
Good, I'm going to bed.

482
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,757
I suggest you do the same.

483
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,473
Wrong bed.

484
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,197
Jeff?

485
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,116
Yeah?

486
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,624
Blow out the candle.

487
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,390
Cute, guys.

488
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,357
Really cute.

489
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,781
These quaaludes are murdering my skin.

490
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:43,832
Shit.

491
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,478
Scott!

492
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:08,648
Hey Scott!

493
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,446
Hey, you guys up there?

494
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,524
Hey Scott, are you up here?

495
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,665
Scott!

496
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,461
May!

497
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,464
Where are you guys?

498
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:57,462
Scott!

499
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:25,767
I'm sorry.

500
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,063
It's just I couldn't sleep.

501
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,110
That's okay.

502
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,949
Maybe we could just sit
here and talk a while?

503
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,571
Whatever you want.

504
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,166
Do you believe in ghosts?

505
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:42,909
No.

506
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,840
- When I was a kid, I
thought I saw a witch.

507
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:53,008
You know how you wake up and see things?

508
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,256
You know, I saw an elf once.

509
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,053
An elf?

510
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,060
How do you know it was an elf?

511
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,227
- Well, what would you
call a three foot man,

512
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,067
white beard, pointed ears, red cap.

513
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,106
A typical textbook elf.

514
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,441
Okay, wow, I think you better
keep that story to yourself.

515
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,033
It's pretty bizarre.

516
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,493
What about you and your witch?

517
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,782
Yeah, I guess you're right.

518
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,031
They're both pretty weird.

519
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,283
Well, I won't tell on you,

520
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,332
if you won't tell on me.

521
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:47,224
- So I guess us weirdos will
just have to stick together.

522
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,760
Oh Wes, Wes!

523
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,432
It's Seth, dammit.

524
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,220
Seth!

525
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,716
Well, time for the john.

526
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:45,217
John?

527
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,594
I thought your name was Seth.

528
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,048
Score another one for the good guys.

529
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,209
Finally crashed out, huh?

530
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,371
That sounds like Seth!

531
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,205
Let's go.

532
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,751
Come on.

533
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,421
What happened?

534
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:26,545
She's dead.

535
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:27,545
Who's dead?

536
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:30,845
I don't know man, that sorority chick.

537
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,396
Oh my God!

538
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:39,690
Run!

539
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,520
Where's Denise?

540
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,317
I don't know, I don't know!

541
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,189
What do you mean you don't know?

542
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,407
Where are you going?

543
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,116
There's a dead chick up there, sport.

544
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,155
I'm getting the hell out of here.

545
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,198
Give me that gun!

546
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,036
Seth!

547
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,655
What are you gonna do?

548
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,076
Seth!

549
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,826
Seth, will you tell us what happened?

550
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,418
I don't know man, I don't know!

551
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,502
Went out to take a leak,

552
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:01,542
when I came back, Denise is gone,

553
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,789
and there's a dead chick in my bed.

554
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,836
The whole world's gone mad!

555
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,673
And you don't know where Denise is?

556
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,917
I don't know where anyone is.

557
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,419
I just know that I am getting out of here.

558
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,170
Wait, no!

559
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,262
Seth, wait!

560
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,927
Seth, where is she?

561
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:16,477
Seth, Seth!

562
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,641
Would you guys wait up?

563
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:18,934
What are you guys doing?

564
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,978
Seth, hold on!

565
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,225
Seth, wait!

566
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,317
Leave me alone, man!

567
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,320
What are you doing?

568
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,028
Blanks!

569
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,242
Those bastards!

570
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,404
Seth, what the hell are you doing?

571
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,325
I'm getting out of here, sport.

572
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,573
Well, what about Marti?

573
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:37,414
We can't just leave her here.

574
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,248
She can't climb this gate.

575
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,493
Leave me alone, man!

576
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,493
Be careful!

577
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,794
Seth, you're gonna kill yourself

578
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,255
trying to get over in your boots!

579
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:45,123
Look out, man!

580
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,123
Listen, Seth!

581
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,591
Seth, take off your boots and
I'll throw them over to you

582
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,756
when you get to the other side.

583
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:50,970
Son of a gun!

584
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:55,095
- When you get the time,
you gotta call the police.

585
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,388
Seth, do you understand?

586
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:57,226
You gotta get help!

587
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,643
Man, I understand, I understand.

588
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,106
I'm gonna try.

589
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,600
You'll never make it.

590
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,853
I'm gonna try, will you help me?

591
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:31,669
Seth!

592
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,303
Seth!

593
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,103
Seth!

594
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,249
Careful!

595
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,153
Seth, are you alright!

596
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,897
I'll live.

597
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,525
Throw me the damn boots, will ya?

598
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,909
Are you gonna be able to make it?

599
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:46,081
I'll make it, sport, I'll make it.

600
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,169
Seth, hurry!

601
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,966
I will, darling, I will!

602
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,912
- We gotta go back in
there and find Denise.

603
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,444
Denise!

604
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:28,493
Denise!

605
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:09,451
Denise!

606
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,506
Denise!

607
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:27,877
Open the door!

608
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,094
Please!

609
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,213
Somebody help!

610
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,076
Hey man, there's been a murder man!

611
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,073
You gotta stop!

612
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,041
Hit the road, asshole!

613
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,024
So what do we do now?

614
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:27,561
We wait.

615
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,486
You think that story about the Garths

616
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,702
and little Andrew was true?

617
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,617
I don't know.

618
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,625
This was supposed to be a joke.

619
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,164
I can't believe it.

620
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,252
Wait a minute!

621
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:48,044
There's light coming
from the garden out here.

622
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,841
I gotta go down there.

623
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,088
Don't go down there!

624
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,590
You'll get yourself killed.

625
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,761
What if it's Denise down there

626
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,758
and she needs our help?

627
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:59,681
And what if it's Andrew?

628
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,768
Don't worry.

629
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:03,768
Jeff, don't go!

630
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,941
Marti, just stay here.

631
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,400
Put the chair back after I'm gone.

632
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:14,777
- Jeff, I don't want
to be left alone here!

633
01:05:21,209 --> 01:05:22,950
It's gonna be okay.

634
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,702
Hey, help!

635
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,276
There's been a murder!

636
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,077
Sam, can you handle this for me?

637
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,120
Yeah.

638
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,537
What fraternity are you with?

639
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,126
The Alpha Sigma Rho.

640
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:38,668
- And that little wiseguy
Peter Bennett's president, huh?

641
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,086
Well you go back up there

642
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,085
and you tell that little
smartass president of yours

643
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:44,212
that if I even see
another Alpha Sig tonight

644
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,430
I'm gonna throw his butt
in jail for 30 days!

645
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,048
Wait a second, you don't understand!

646
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,140
This is for real!

647
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,725
We were up at Garth Manor
and somebody was killed!

648
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:52,685
- Hey Ross, I got another one
for the tank for you here.

649
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,225
What?

650
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:55,564
No, no, this is no stunt!

651
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:57,649
Listen, there's kids up
there getting murdered!

652
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,939
Son, you kids have been getting away

653
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,403
with murder all night long.

654
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,863
Now either you get the hell out of here,

655
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,232
or you're gonna spend the night in jail.

656
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,576
You heard him, now move it.

657
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,453
No, I'm sorry.

658
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:52,742
I'm sorry, but we'll send a unit

659
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,162
as soon as one is available.

660
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:55,908
Okay.

661
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:41,086
How long do you think Seth's been gone?

662
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,956
Couple hours maybe, I don't know.

663
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,721
Do you think we're gonna make it?

664
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,181
We'll make it.

665
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:55,801
All we can do is wait right now.

666
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,644
It's gonna be okay.

667
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,245
Pull it back.

668
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:05,222
He's still alive!

669
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,690
And he's down there someplace.

670
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:10,861
I'm going after him.

671
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:11,853
Are you crazy?

672
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,821
- Look, I'm not waiting for
him to come back here again!

673
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,486
- What about Seth, Seth
is bringing back help.

674
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:16,483
Seth isn't coming back!

675
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:17,484
What do you mean?

676
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:18,406
Because if he was coming back

677
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:19,619
he would've been here by now!

678
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,113
- Then we'll wait, we'll
wait until morning.

679
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,706
Peter and the other kids will be here.

680
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,450
Peter's dead.

681
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:26,292
What?

682
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,376
I found him out there in the garden,

683
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,588
I didn't want to tell you before.

684
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:36,094
Okay, just stay here, I'm going after him.

685
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,215
No, I'm coming with you!

686
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:02,931
Watch your head.

687
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:24,573
Jeff, this is crazy.

688
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,321
I'm not stopping 'til I get him.

689
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,448
He knows this house better than we do,

690
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:29,245
and if we don't get him
now, he's gonna get us.

691
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,458
We're at the basement already.

692
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:32,248
Let's go back.

693
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,165
I'm not...

694
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:35,873
It goes deeper.

695
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,166
Come on.

696
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,355
He must be in there.

697
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,363
Come on.

698
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,718
There must be tunnels leading
all over under this place.

699
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,139
Please, let's go back.

700
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:14,638
We're gonna get lost down here.

701
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:19,935
Let's take a look.

702
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:23,655
There's some sort of light down there.

703
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:30,319
Marti, here!

704
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:41,167
No!

705
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,251
Give me your arm!

706
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:35,804
Get out.

707
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,466
What do you want?

708
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:40,810
I want your car, now get out!

709
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:41,894
You can't do this!

710
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,354
I'm gonna call the cops!

711
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:44,723
Good idea, tell the cops!

712
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,441
Tell them I'll be at Garth Manor!

713
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,281
How's your leg?

714
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,827
Hurts really bad.

715
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,622
I don't believe what was down there.

716
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,123
Denise is dead too.

717
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,547
What are we gonna do now?

718
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:19,974
I don't know.

719
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,021
I don't know.

720
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,379
Jeff! Marti!

721
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:48,127
I killed him!

722
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:49,345
I killed him...

723
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,178
Seth!

724
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:57,225
Oh my God, we didn't think
you were coming back.

725
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,641
He killed everybody but us.

726
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:02,232
Peter, Scott, May,
Denise, they're all dead!

727
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,478
The stinking cops wouldn't believe me,

728
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:06,900
so I had to come here by myself.

729
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,398
I killed him out by the pond!

730
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:09,694
You should've seen him, man.

731
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:10,532
It was like...

732
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:12,443
Jeff!

733
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:38,886
Seth!

734
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,058
Seth!

735
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:51,357
I'm gonna get the gun.

736
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:52,734
No!

737
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,701
I'm gonna get the gun!

738
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:49,503
Seth?

739
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:01,643
Seth?

740
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:34,753
Who did Seth kill?

741
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,174
I don't know!

742
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:47,556
Go!

743
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:55,731
Go.

744
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:01,036
Keep going!

745
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:16,875
Marti!

746
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:28,104
Jeff!
