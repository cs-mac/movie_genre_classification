00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:07,309

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,310

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,311

4
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:16,312

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,374


6
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:28,743
"THE ROOT OF VIOLENCE
Is science without humanity "

7
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:33,300
Mahatma Gandhi

8
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,819
-Y?
-I flinched.

9
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:47,573
Honey, you're pregnant.
It's not cancer.

10
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:49,675
'I get.
I know.

11
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:54,659
I think I need
another day.

12
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,329
Ask Tony.

13
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,397
Very well. Thank you.

14
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,862
Sorry.
-You have to.

15
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:05,832
Yes, I know.

16
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:29,682
-Hey, mister.
-Hello.

17
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,519
What are you doing up?

18
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,939
-Take a walk in the woods.
-If?

19
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,320
-If.
'Sounds sexy and fun.

20
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,800
-Was galloping?
Yes, no pants.

21
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:43,260
It was just what I was dreaming

22
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,962
-Really?
'Probably I'm psychic.

23
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,263
-It's so strange.
-If.

24
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,016
It is not a coincidence.

25
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:50,417
Even I have pants under this

26
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,508
-Really?
-You know

27
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:53,809
Seriously?

28
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:58,099
Well, how about this?

29
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,350
-Are you ready?
- If

30
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:04,633
Rather be locked in a room

31
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,930
full of snakes
or spiders?

32
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,389
U ants

33
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,610
-What kind snakes?
-Large

34
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:14,757
-Poisonous?
-Mmm could not kill

35
00:06:14,758 --> 00:06:16,419
What kind of spiders?

36
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:19,202
Big and ugly

37
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,900
There could be a bear?

38
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:24,228
because it seems that are going for a bear

39
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:27,579
no
snakes and large spiders

40
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,581
-Choose one.
-No ... Snakes

41
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,732
Well,
Now one for you

42
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:35,513
Rather be locked
 in a room that is ...

43
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:39,080
frozen or hot?

44
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,386
I mean really hot
As burning

45
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,299
-I get something in the room?
-No, you get nothing!

46
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,099
No blankets?

47
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,224
You can have a blanket
in the hot room

48
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,694
I have an interesting.

49
00:06:57,695 --> 00:07:00,215
Answer the question!
"I have an interesting".

50
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:04,114
-Umm ... the hot
-If?

51
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:07,210
'Now, I'm all ears
-Oh, yeah?

52
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,371
I want to hear your riddle
forward.

53
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:11,109
You're so distracted now.

54
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,769
'You're distracting
My God, a dolphin looks sweet.

55
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,694
I love this dolphin.

56
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:20,891
You have to see what
come.

57
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:22,233
-To come?
-Oh yeah.

58
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm going to tattoo the whole body,

59
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,001
-It will be very sexy.
- What you gonna do?

60
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:27,302
A tent Coi.

61
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,247
Japanese-waves.
-Fish, waves and dolphins?

62
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:34,034
-You will be the aquarium O. Tayler.
-If.

63
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,299
'Very well, you see if you supported?
-If.

64
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,296
-I will be there.
-Really?

65
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:40,189
-If.
-Think it worthwhile?

66
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,258
'I'm very happy.
-If?

67
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,900
What?

68
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,469
Grizly'm a bear!

69
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,718
Well, move aside, no one wants
be close to a white boy

70
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:01,019
-Really?
-If.

71
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,007
-Officially've ruined the moment
-Every day.

72
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,758
-We gotta go.
-No.

73
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,783
It's not my fault.
Work is work.

74
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,685
Seriously, if we now
we will not return.

75
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:18,697
Come.

76
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:24,046
- What are you doing there?
I was trying to scare them.

77
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,691
Let's stay another day,
but ...

78
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:29,832
-I sinto excluded.
-Is he left me.

79
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,091
We have to leave at 5am.

80
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:33,392
-Well?
-Well.

81
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:34,794
Beauty?

82
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:37,036
-Well
-Well, we will not go with laps

83
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:39,229
-We gotta go. Really.
-Well.

84
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,800
What?

85
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,490
What?

86
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,450
- What are you doing?
-Is that Tony is going to freak.

87
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:13,676
Is morphine, not crack.
Well, it's almost crack.

88
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:16,600
If, you know how he is.
Mr. Clean

89
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:19,479
-He put him in the foot
-Really? All right.

90
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,482
It is the hardest thing
you've done?

91
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,783
Shut up.

92
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,597
-They were fighting?
- What?

93
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:40,276
'It was a guy thing.
-These girls ...

94
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,850
Here

95
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,887
-The famous waffles?
'Maybe next time.

96
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,000
$ 20 charge.

97
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,497
-The bathroom?
-Back.

98
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,632
Excuse me.

99
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:48,088
My car ran out of fuel
and is 1 km from here

100
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,765
- You think you can take me?
He finished his fuel?

101
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:55,567
Yeah not a good night for
a walk, right?

102
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,198
Think you can give me
a ride?

103
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,138
-Yes, of course. No problem.
'All right. Thanks

104
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,439
-Just give me a minute.
'All right.

105
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,779
-Thank you.
-Let

106
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,000
Thank you.

107
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,719
Everything went well?

108
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:36,381
No more toilet paper
so I had to use my hands.

109
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,271
-Just a minute, okay?
-Yeah sure, no problem.

110
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,700
What? I told him we'd give him a ride
It ran out of fuel

111
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:47,600
We were rushing to get home
and delay us now okay?

112
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:50,058
No, it goes in the same
direction we

113
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,780
Do not you think you should ask before

114
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:55,681
to offer as a taxi
an unknown stalker?

115
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:59,880
She is as much a single rush.
-Unknown Stalker

116
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:02,720
You're probably right.
The new style is stalking

117
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,447
lead young people on the roadside
to 1 am.

118
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:07,247
Not funny.

119
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:09,761
How about if you had been a
I was hitchhiking?

120
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,488
I'm just saying ... to pick up a woman
in a service station ...

121
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,657
-Hi, I'm Diana.
-Tayler.

122
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,170
'I'm Nick.
-Thank you both.

123
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:22,471
No problem.

124
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,033
We will give you a ride

125
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:31,910
Thank you.

126
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,863
I love that song ...

127
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,703
-Your perfume smells ... smells good.
-Thank you.

128
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,672
I designed it myself.
It's what I do.

129
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,819
Did not you say that your car was here?

130
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,841
Yes, it is.
It's right there.

131
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,820
Wait a minute, I'll bring
some samples for you guys

132
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:55,753
'No need.
-I insist.

133
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,299
She is so ..
I know, I'm sorry.

134
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,700
But that club.

134
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,700
shit!

135
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,000
Holy shit!

136
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,300
Damn it!

137
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,100
and we tied

138
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,700
That means nothing.

139
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,800
I say we do.

140
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,000
I do not even know
if the video is real.

141
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,200
I do not think we can 100%
with only 4 of them.

142
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,500
Maybe not with what we have.

143
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:45,500
This is not right,
and you know it.

144
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,000
Guys are starting to wake up


145
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,800
Shit!
We have to take uma decision.

146
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:56,484
I'll take for us

147
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,000
Jesus Christ!

148
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,900
What the fuck is wrong with you?

149
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,800
Stop!. Stop!. Stop!

150
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,499
Get your hands off me.
Get away from me!

151
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay, okay.

152
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,101
-What's going on?
I do not know.

153
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,401
We were trapped
here too.

154
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,100
You do not know?
You do not know?

155
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:50,100
Why the fuck broke the nail
my girlfriend?

156
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:52,100
-The Video!
-The video is shit!

157
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,500
What video?

158
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,201
You have to see for yourself

159
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:00,601
Come upstairs.
Come.

160
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,100
Come!

161
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:04,401
Come!

162
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,901
Hello Welcome
my house

163
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:56,500
I apologize for the
uncomfortable circumstances

164
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:58,100
that brought them here

165
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:00,801
But I can assure
that by working together,

166
00:18:00,802 --> 00:18:03,000
May leave all
very little time

167
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:05,300
 As everyone has noticed,

168
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:09,200
I installed a piece of jewelry
at the head of each of you.

169
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:12,501
This device serves
to do one thing only:

170
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:14,978
Which consists in obtaining
particularly certain chemicals

171
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:17,601
 their brains
occur naturally.

172
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:20,701
Unfortunately,
the chemist who need

173
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:23,152
They are produced only when

174
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:26,100
The brain tells the body
that is in danger.

175
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:29,001
Pain is the only
Out of this house.

176
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:32,800
This will not be easy for either
of you

177
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,200
But by working together,

178
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:38,900
I have confidence that find
the way through this process

179
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:42,501
as safely and efficiently as
possible.

180
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:46,800
22 hours will be awarded
to fulfill its task.

181
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:49,148
The clock starts
 the countdown

182
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,801
As soon as they start.

183
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:53,101
Good Luck.

184
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,101
There's your explanation.

185
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:02,101
What the hell ...

186
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:10,100
I'm Nick,
she is Tayler,

187
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:11,900
-Tony ...
-Hello.

188
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,500
Sam, Greg, Julian and Tara.

189
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,900
Fantastico!
We're all friends.

190
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:19,500
We can find a way
leaving this shit house?

191
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,401
Already checked. It's all locked up.
There is no escape.

192
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:25,100
Maybe we forzarr something
or knock down this door.

193
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:28,600
force? force?
the kitchen counter?

194
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,200
That is, are steel plates.
You can not force.

195
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:34,000
There must be a way.

196
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,301
None except the video

197
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,600
The video is fake, right?

198
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:39,600
It's just a fucking sick joke.

199
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,100
It's true.

200
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:42,401
How do you know?

201
00:19:42,402 --> 00:19:44,776
The chemicals in the
I was talking about are:

202
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:46,539
Dopamine, serotonin
and adrenaline.

203
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,601
They do drugs
with these things.

204
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:50,800
The video is very real.

205
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:52,101
She's not lying.

206
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:56,301
The drug is made to experience
in people.

207
00:19:58,101 --> 00:19:59,800
How are we going to do?

208
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:02,201
Do what?
Torturing? Among us?

209
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,700
We will not.

210
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:07,401
There must be another way
leaving this house.

211
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,601
You know, people
brought us.

212
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:15,101
obviously has the power
to stay here.

213
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:16,779
They came and captured

214
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,002
and had no possibility
to resist or fight.

215
00:20:19,003 --> 00:20:21,902
Well, look ...
How long have we been here?

216
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:24,703
Who knows? Maybe have been
several days.

217
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:27,003
Idiot!

218
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:30,103
Do you realize
what have you done?

219
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,802
Now we are here
and damn you started the countdown.

220
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:36,202
We have not discussed
something like this before.

221
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:38,403
Sorry, I was a
both concerned about

222
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,503
-Surviving, to schedule ...
-Damn it!

223
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:46,802
Well, the clock has started and
Talk will not stop him.

224
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,203
I can not do this.

225
00:20:49,403 --> 00:20:52,803
You want to take the risk
to find out what happens when
the clock reaches zero?

226
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:56,202
We are nine, right?

227
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:59,002
I'm thinking
that if we separated,

228
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,903
perhaps
not so bad

229
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:05,202
I do not separate myself sucks

230
00:21:05,203 --> 00:21:07,002
With none of you.

231
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:08,702
There must be another way.

232
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:12,202
I'm telling you, man,
You are locked.

233
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:13,902
What we been?

234
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:15,503
Wait, you two know each other?

235
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:18,002
-Calm down, Julian ...
-You did this

236
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:21,503
'You're gonna get us killed.
Do not say anything stupid

237
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:25,503
This is just a house!

238
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:31,203
Let me out!

239
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:33,003
! Motherfuckers!

240
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:38,402
Want pain?
I'll give you pain ...

241
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:41,703
But you will not get
nothing of me.

242
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:48,803
I we do
a vote, right?

243
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:52,902
Who thinks to do
what the girl said the tv?

244
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:55,703
so we can
out of here ...

245
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:59,302
Raise your hand.

246
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:00,603
Right?

247
00:22:11,803 --> 00:22:13,703
Well, let's do it then.

248
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:24,903
Fuck it.

249
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:30,603
-I would not do that, man.
-Fuck you.

250
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:33,803
I will not spend more
a single second in this house.

251
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:35,104
Julian!

252
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,205
You need to be
tough guy ...

254
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,050
My God!

255
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,804
Only needs to be
a very tough guy.

256
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,323
He's dead.

257
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:27,624
There is only one option.

258
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:31,323
You guys should not
be men?

259
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:33,324
Having a little more
responsibility?

260
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:36,024
You want to engage
 women in this?

261
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,824
I want to live to see
my son again.

262
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:45,923
And if I have to torture
each of the women here ...

263
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,224
will.

264
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,949
We are all in this together.

265
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,599
So no trash feminism
Right?

266
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,223
Damn feminism?
Son of a bitch!

267
00:23:57,224 --> 00:23:58,724
Who do you think you are?

268
00:23:59,424 --> 00:24:01,223
-Hey, stop!
-Waste of feminism?

269
00:24:01,224 --> 00:24:03,624
Stop, stop, okay?
Can we at least agree

270
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,724
not going to discuss
stop the clock?

271
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:07,924
He's running.
We're wasting time.

272
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:11,224
Okay, but I say
He might be the first.

273
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:22,424
Very well.
I think I'll do the honors.

274
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:11,729
Shit.
This is not working.

275
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,030
Says who?

276
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,030
We did this for an hour.
We have to think of something else.

277
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,130
Is taking too long
and energy intensive.

278
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,130
He's right ...

279
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,429
I do not know much
the subject, but ...

280
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,229
I'm pretty sure the brain
produces these chemicals

281
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,930
of which she was talking ...

282
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,730
All you need is ...

283
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,830
Is it?

284
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,729
Just ...
have sex ...

285
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,129
Ah ... please ...

286
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,729
Now is not the time
to think about that little boy.

287
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,229
Just saying ...

288
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,530
Well, do not do

289
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:51,529
Fucking disgusting piece of shit.

290
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,530
I'd rather be tortured.

291
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,830
Well, then ...
What do we do?

292
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,930
Guys ...

293
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,830
I think Greg had the idea
correct after all.

294
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,029
Listen, pal ...

295
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,830
We will stop at 14%
Is it okay?

296
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,591
Right?

297
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,230
Hurry up with that.

298
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,230
Should I hit him with my shoe
or something?

299
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,230
I think we will have
to be a little rough.

300
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,930
I remember you.

301
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,049
- How much are we?
-7.5%!

302
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,630
Almost there, friend,
Hold. Almost there.

303
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:32,431
Wait. He knows something
not telling us.

304
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,631
What I was saying
Julian, Greg?

305
00:27:36,632 --> 00:27:38,831
About being a tough guy?

306
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:40,866
Do you know who is doing this?

307
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:45,931
Tell us what you know!

308
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:50,830
I do not know ...
nothing.

309
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:52,131
I know nothing.

310
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:54,731
Son of a bitch!

311
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:08,231
No! No! What the fuck?
What the fuck?

312
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:16,630
Stop!

313
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:19,331
Stop!
Stop!

314
00:28:30,431 --> 00:28:32,230
Are we going to leave?

315
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:35,130
No, no, no.
This is not over yet.

316
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,931
No time to waste, remember?

317
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:46,531
Tell us what you know!

318
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:48,631
What is your problem?

319
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:51,231
Is my problem?

320
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:55,631
He knows ...
We voted, remember?

321
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:00,931
And it was you who changed
extreme methods.

322
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:03,731
I changed ...?
Are you crazy?

323
00:29:05,531 --> 00:29:07,331
You broke her leg
half!

324
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:11,731
Even if we allow the psychopath
leave the house, how will he escape?

325
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,630
How the hell are we going to get out of here?

326
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:16,730
What the hell was I supposed to do?

327
00:29:16,731 --> 00:29:19,431
You said, from torturing the guy,
so torture the guy, damn!

328
00:29:19,931 --> 00:29:24,631
He knows something and is not telling us!
And remember what you said Julian?

329
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,030
Look, we have to be
smart with this.

330
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:32,031
None of us want
go through this. You okay?

331
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,331
Shit.

332
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:37,831
Well, be careful.

333
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,631
Shit.

334
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:43,131
When is your turn?

335
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:45,031
Fuck

336
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:49,231
This is not over.

337
00:29:51,531 --> 00:29:52,831
Who's next?

338
00:29:53,331 --> 00:29:54,631
I found this.

339
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:01,031
Well, that's not such a good idea

340
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,131
this is done in each
at once.

341
00:30:04,143 --> 00:30:05,971
What do you suggest?

342
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:08,767
Make like half and half.

343
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:10,767
All we can
end like Greg.

344
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:14,795
Half or all together,

345
00:30:14,796 --> 00:30:17,000
nobody will cut
nothing of my body.

346
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:19,227
My fingers
stay with me.

347
00:30:19,228 --> 00:30:20,935
Thank you very much.

348
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,848
Nick is right.

349
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:25,951
We'll have to get
Greg from here.

350
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:28,990
We can not afford any more
serious leg injuries.

351
00:30:29,907 --> 00:30:32,558
In my opinion, I think that we should not
do anything at all.

352
00:30:33,224 --> 00:30:35,284
If we refuse
into her game,

353
00:30:35,285 --> 00:30:37,371
at least achieve
these bastards

354
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:38,860
display.

355
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:41,747
Maybe it's a hoax.

356
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:43,411
And if she's right?

357
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:46,300
And if we do nothing?
We let the clock run.

358
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:48,329
We may be enough
strong to fight

359
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,263
against whoever
we are doing this.

360
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:53,021
No.
We will not.

361
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:55,495
Think

362
00:30:57,766 --> 00:30:59,302
We're all here.

363
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:02,199
We grabbed
in an open,

364
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,628
We're supposed to fill
one of these little bottles,

365
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,478
Why the
right not full?

366
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:10,719
These things are sending
or received a signal.

367
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,330
Whoever we
put here

368
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,158
we can kill with only
 pressing a button.

369
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,663
And never disclose their
identity to us.

370
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:23,852
We must act intelligently,
we have to think how to overcome this,

371
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,635
we can all leave
of here alive.

372
00:31:32,502 --> 00:31:33,806
I agree.

373
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:36,370
Yes, you're right.

374
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:39,945
I guess I also agree.

375
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,519
So now we have to
Carefully torture us?

376
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,822
Twice??

377
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:48,371
So expect this
 not a hoax?

378
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,246
And then we leave
free?

379
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:52,910
Yes, exactly
what.

380
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,796
Is it okay for you pineapple?

381
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,238
Do not talk that way,
princess.

382
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,419
I will not support a
fuck you.

383
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,624
Stop.
Stop, right?

384
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,127
Do not do this
in a silly fight.

385
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:08,151
Talk is not going to take
anywhere.

386
00:32:08,152 --> 00:32:10,660
We have important decisions
to make.

387
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:14,262
For example, how do we decide
who's next?

388
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:17,139
We have to move forward with the plan.
The clock is ticking.

389
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,700
Talk to us we will
help anything.

390
00:32:32,888 --> 00:32:34,212
We will overcome.

391
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:37,764
With what?

392
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:42,096
Come with me.

393
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:43,799
Come with me.

394
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:37,104
I'll go first.

395
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,044
All right.

396
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,477
Damn it, come on.

397
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:09,949
Let's do this
shit here.

398
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:12,755
Come.

399
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:26,200
Oh, shit.

400
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,003
Are you going to undress?

401
00:36:36,635 --> 00:36:38,283
It's my favorite shirt.

402
00:36:39,594 --> 00:36:41,567
What the hell is all this?

403
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:44,544
Not everyone was
a good childhood.

404
00:36:44,545 --> 00:36:46,051
Is this going to work at least?

405
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:47,993
Can you at least feel something?

406
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,799
A girls like scars

407
00:36:52,183 --> 00:36:53,488
Wait.

408
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:56,046
-Promise
- What?

409
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,999
Promise me you will not get
with my genitals.

410
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:04,689
Okay, Sure.

411
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,109
Nothing genitals.

412
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,300
I think I speak for us all

413
00:37:08,301 --> 00:37:10,800
when I say that I wish
if they did the same.

414
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:12,782
Yeah, I'm with him.

415
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:15,495
I do not want anyone
touch my face.

416
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:18,903
Really?
Are you kidding?

417
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:22,311
Now is not the time
of being vain, guys.

418
00:37:22,312 --> 00:37:24,894
Do not think I protect my
ball is in vain.

419
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,411
Sure, if you want to touch
your face, we'll think of something.

420
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,995
Seriously, what's your problem?

421
00:37:29,996 --> 00:37:32,691
You are my problem.
Incredible.

422
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:34,024
Bitch!

423
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:37,264
Very well.
Are you ready?

424
00:37:45,071 --> 00:37:46,377
Sorry, mate.

425
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:17,794
Are we?

426
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,156
We're

427
00:38:19,572 --> 00:38:22,751
-1.5% To finish, okay?
-Come.

428
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:28,833
-Use the pliers.
- What?

429
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:32,583
Use the pliers.

430
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:38,902
Are you ready?

431
00:38:38,903 --> 00:38:40,255
Come on, man.

432
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,686
Here we go.
Are you ready?

433
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,031
If.

434
00:38:44,343 --> 00:38:45,843
Wait, do not need this.

435
00:38:45,844 --> 00:38:48,212
Let's do it.
Come.

436
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,819
All right, buddy.

437
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:02,043
Shit.

438
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,989
-We?
-We?

439
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,079
Very well.

440
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,435
All right.

441
00:39:12,202 --> 00:39:13,696
Damn, that is.

442
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,347
-Shit
-We get

443
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,781
That's it.

444
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:31,455
You did.

445
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:38,258
Good job, buddy.

446
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,711
Be careful with that

447
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:54,626
Shit.
I have you.

448
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,522
Sorry, mate.

449
00:40:11,014 --> 00:40:12,686
Jesus Christ.

450
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:14,967
We did it.

451
00:40:53,907 --> 00:40:55,211
Are you okay?

452
00:40:56,743 --> 00:40:58,609
Superb.

453
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,343
Sorry.
Stupid question.

454
00:41:05,735 --> 00:41:07,055
You ...

455
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:09,671
You were very good.

456
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:13,980
Thank you.

457
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:19,022
Thank you.

458
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,790
Why?

459
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:25,159
I do not know.

460
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:30,963
Taking over

461
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,371
Help us out of this.

462
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:37,098
At least someone here
common sense.

463
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:40,471
probably
would have ended

464
00:41:40,472 --> 00:41:42,291
dead
if not for you.

465
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:46,671
Probably ...

466
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,431
If.

467
00:41:56,158 --> 00:41:58,200
Do you think
out of here?

468
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,178
Not all

469
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:07,890
Not all

470
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:12,659
If.

471
00:42:13,354 --> 00:42:15,098
Probably
you're right

472
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,979
What will you do if
you get out?

473
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:33,269
Continue to work

474
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:35,318
Really?
So much you like your job?

475
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:42,070
No, not really

476
00:42:45,658 --> 00:42:47,210
And what are you gonna do?

477
00:42:48,534 --> 00:42:49,854
Not.

478
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:54,027
Whatever it is,

479
00:42:55,347 --> 00:42:57,021
Tayler will be there.

480
00:43:03,767 --> 00:43:05,410
Can you do me
a favor, man?

481
00:43:05,411 --> 00:43:07,962
I feel I am
losing a lot of blood here.

482
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:10,910
Could you bring me some gauze
the other room?

483
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:12,223
Sure.

484
00:43:12,224 --> 00:43:14,706
 Nick.
It's your turn.

485
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:16,452
Shit!

486
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,587
I'll go look for them, man.
Do not worry.

487
00:43:28,778 --> 00:43:31,185
Do you think they'll let me
do here?

488
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:37,715
Yeah, right.
Why not?

489
00:44:03,514 --> 00:44:05,051
He will be fine.

490
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:10,493
We are now tying
so ...

491
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:15,878
Not so.
I know Nick will be strong.

492
00:44:16,843 --> 00:44:18,359
I'm so scared.

493
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:26,027
So do I.

494
00:44:35,482 --> 00:44:38,227
One must concentrate.

495
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,109
Focus on this end.

496
00:44:42,774 --> 00:44:46,322
The pain will pass, you know?
That is ...

497
00:44:46,323 --> 00:44:49,099
That's what Sam said


498
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:51,831
That's what Sam said?

499
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:54,715
Genial.
This is wonderful.

500
00:44:56,979 --> 00:44:59,138
I'm just trying to help,

501
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:01,802
I had not
easy for me.

502
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:07,299
Sorry.

503
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,716
It's just that I have other things
in my mind now.

504
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:16,527
I'm pregnant for a month.

505
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,206
Are you serious?

506
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:26,474
I was going to tell
this weekend.

507
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,927
Does he not know?

508
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:35,889
Just ...

509
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,600
Just tell
when we're done.

510
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,299
Do you know?

511
00:45:41,115 --> 00:45:43,479
We will find a way,
Okay?

512
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,962
I promise.

513
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,500
What are you doing?

514
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,011
Is that Tony is going to freak.

515
00:46:11,012 --> 00:46:12,866
Is morphine, not crack.

516
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:15,051
If, you know how he is.
Mr. Clean

517
00:46:32,674 --> 00:46:35,108
Where is Tayler?
I do not want to start without her.

518
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:37,183
Vou go for it
Right?

519
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,362
No time
for this.

520
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:42,503
Fuck
I want to wait for my girlfriend.

521
00:46:50,363 --> 00:46:52,182
You have to trust me.

522
00:46:52,506 --> 00:46:53,822
I love you.

523
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:57,519
Greg is awake.

524
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,500
He can lift?
'Not by chance

525
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:02,935
We will have to make a stretcher
or something to remove it.

526
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:05,082
Maybe not.

527
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:08,583
What do you mean? How do we get out of here
with him? is a big guy.

528
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:12,300
All I'm saying is that you
are right.

529
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:14,710
If we get out of here,

530
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:17,627
We will need
all the strength we have.

531
00:47:17,628 --> 00:47:20,050
That is why
decided to divide.

532
00:47:20,051 --> 00:47:21,566
-Half and half
-Right

533
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:24,691
What I'm saying is, we all
to make our first part.

534
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:27,146
Sam is not
so badly injured as Greg.

535
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:30,032
Sam did not have a fucking screwdriver
tucked into knee, right?

536
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:32,539
What you're saying is:
make our halves,

537
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,579
leave it there
and do the rest of Greg?

538
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,914
Lower your voice,
He might hear you.

539
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:39,235
Really?

540
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:41,594
He will die. If we leave,
will die.

541
00:47:41,595 --> 00:47:44,191
What else can we do?
-Go ahead with the plan.

542
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:47,800
-I agree with her.
- What? No! No!

543
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,902
No, dear ...
I do not want to be like him.

544
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:51,652
I can not do this anymore.

545
00:47:52,023 --> 00:47:53,606
I can not do.

546
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,962
He was going to do with us

547
00:47:55,963 --> 00:47:58,160
Did you forget that he was
he who tied us all?

548
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:00,811
We agree.

549
00:48:01,223 --> 00:48:03,503
What?
You two?

550
00:48:07,502 --> 00:48:10,138
Sam.
What about you?

551
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:15,190
Whoa!

552
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,269
Fucking awesome.

553
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,403
You know what?
Do what you want.

554
00:48:20,404 --> 00:48:21,841
I'll take
my portmanteau

555
00:48:21,842 --> 00:48:24,100
because they do not want
in my consciousness.

556
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,991
-Honey, please do not.
Do not touch me.

557
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:29,947
They are cowards.

558
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:34,238
And because they are cowards,
deserve to be here.

559
00:48:44,911 --> 00:48:47,460
The clock is ticking,
let's end this.

560
00:48:49,722 --> 00:48:51,087
So ...

561
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:54,179
We will continue
with the original plan.

562
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,790
Tear one more.

563
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:41,978
Today is wrong to be strong.

564
00:49:51,714 --> 00:49:53,079
No.

565
00:49:53,443 --> 00:49:55,252
No, please, stop.

566
00:50:07,897 --> 00:50:09,379
Push the damn hole!

567
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:13,087
No, please, stop.
Please stop.

568
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:19,122
What happened?

569
00:50:19,502 --> 00:50:22,102
Why not raised the
percentage as the others?

570
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:24,422
Not.

571
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,866
That will happen
with all of us?

572
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:30,585
- Should we make it harder?
-No.

573
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:34,226
We need to calm down
Right?

574
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:39,326
Maybe it has to do with
chemical balance of each.

575
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:52,026
All right.

576
00:50:53,826 --> 00:50:56,343
You will not leave here
crying.

577
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,292
You can do it

578
00:51:00,652 --> 00:51:02,103
You must be strong ...

579
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:04,974
No! Get away from me!
I do not want to do this.

580
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:17,582
Let's get it.

581
00:51:44,695 --> 00:51:47,158
What?
No, no.

582
00:51:47,735 --> 00:51:50,369
Come on, we have
time for this.

583
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,427
Shut up, you fucking bitch.
Just go.

584
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:55,251
I do not want to do this.

585
00:51:58,711 --> 00:52:01,867
We're all in this together,
Remember? We are a team.

586
00:52:03,043 --> 00:52:04,610
She's right, Lisa.

587
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:06,778
Do not make us pull
the door, okay?

588
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:08,536
We will end soon.

589
00:52:08,537 --> 00:52:09,914
Please.

590
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:11,727
Please.

591
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:14,288
I do not want to do this.

592
00:52:38,516 --> 00:52:40,739
Damn it!
No, no!

593
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,371
No!
I do not want to go.

594
00:52:42,372 --> 00:52:45,154
Come!
No, I do.

595
00:52:45,155 --> 00:52:47,855
I do not want.

596
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:51,406
No! No! No!

597
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:53,799
Let me!

598
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,055
Grab his legs.
Grab his legs.

599
00:52:56,056 --> 00:52:59,293
Please do not.
I do not want to do this.

600
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:01,682
No!

601
00:53:02,018 --> 00:53:03,720
Please
do not make me do this.

602
00:53:03,721 --> 00:53:05,359
Please!
Please!

603
00:53:05,758 --> 00:53:08,247
Do not want to do this.

604
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:12,902
God!

605
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,122
Sorry.

606
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:38,247
I'm sorry.

607
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:42,335
I wanted to help.

608
00:53:45,394 --> 00:53:46,972
I'm sorry.

609
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:56,851
I heard what
said about Greg.

610
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,899
About quitting.

611
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,386
I will not

612
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:05,586
Do not let anyone
touch it again

613
00:54:05,587 --> 00:54:06,967
You do not understand.

614
00:54:06,968 --> 00:54:08,670
Understand that?

615
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:13,078
What a man
suffer and die to save himself?

616
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:15,375
Not only did I save myself Nick

617
00:54:19,219 --> 00:54:21,894
Go look the monkey
to see which level you are.

618
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:29,739
Perhaps almost finished.

619
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,107
I thought the pills
might be helpful.

620
00:54:36,108 --> 00:54:37,543
Well, I took

621
00:54:40,046 --> 00:54:41,827
I'm pregnant, Nick.

622
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:45,576
What?

623
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:49,126
Pregnant?

624
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:02,864
She did.
Order.

625
00:55:27,903 --> 00:55:29,529
So now that you are pregnant.

626
00:55:29,907 --> 00:55:31,515
Should
you out?

627
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:33,362
I beg you.

628
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:36,798
Pleading not work.
I had to.

629
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,634
So everybody
has to.

630
00:55:39,495 --> 00:55:42,450
No, she did not

631
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:43,751
I will.

632
00:55:43,752 --> 00:55:45,170
I will take his place.

633
00:55:47,018 --> 00:55:49,191
The clock is ticking,
Superman.

634
00:55:49,192 --> 00:55:51,783
Still missing you 6%

635
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:56,008
There is a good reason for
Tayler is'm not occurred?

636
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,464
The pills were in my stocking
and I forgot.

637
00:55:59,465 --> 00:56:02,542
Just trying to help,
I'm sorry, I swear.

638
00:56:06,604 --> 00:56:07,947
Pills do?

639
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:09,619
What pills?

640
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:14,347
I forgot. The suit
and forgot I had them.

641
00:56:14,348 --> 00:56:16,406
Did you pills
all this time?

642
00:56:17,387 --> 00:56:18,852
The want

643
00:56:19,253 --> 00:56:21,406
I did my part.
Give them to me!

644
00:56:31,482 --> 00:56:33,887
No, no, no, no.

645
00:56:33,888 --> 00:56:35,383
Do not.

646
00:56:36,415 --> 00:56:39,731
He did his part.
He owes us nothing.

647
00:56:39,732 --> 00:56:42,500
Nick?
Hey, Nick, take the pills.

648
00:56:42,501 --> 00:56:43,955
-Sam, rectrocede.
-We voted.

649
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:47,602
-Step back, dammit.
Well, whatever.

650
00:56:47,603 --> 00:56:49,144
We will not
to touch

651
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:51,130
They voted for that?

652
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:54,163
What are you talking about?

653
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,150
Come on, man.

654
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,838
They wanted to leave
here.

655
00:57:03,746 --> 00:57:07,620
Use all your pain
and then leave you here.

656
00:57:08,752 --> 00:57:10,948
Take them,
is the only way.

657
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:15,400
You, good boy,
That was not your decision.

658
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:16,932
You can not
simply decide

659
00:57:20,734 --> 00:57:22,422
We have to get back to work.

660
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:24,480
The clock is ticking.

661
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,399
What will we do with Tayler?

662
00:57:29,537 --> 00:57:30,855
I will.

663
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,739
Come on man,
know you can not.

664
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,090
Since these all fucking
and you still have the other half.

665
00:57:35,091 --> 00:57:36,535
No, no, I can bear.

666
00:57:37,278 --> 00:57:39,990
No. Tony and I'll help
to share part of it.

667
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,621
No matter what you do,
let's get on with it.

668
00:58:01,938 --> 00:58:03,246
Very well.

669
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:04,962
We all at one time.

670
00:58:05,538 --> 00:58:07,859
We will not stop until I make
to 60%.

671
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:09,811
We can do this.

672
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,719
Thanks for doing this.

673
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,207
I love you, Tay.
We will overcome.

674
00:58:18,182 --> 00:58:19,622
Are you ready?

675
00:58:28,978 --> 00:58:31,846
I can not!
I can not!

676
00:58:38,874 --> 00:58:40,879
Sorry.

677
00:58:47,187 --> 00:58:48,503
Come on, one more time.

678
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,858
Again.

679
00:58:54,023 --> 00:58:56,750
No! No!
No!

680
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:22,111
No!

681
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:36,507
Hello, sleepyhead.

682
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,063
Look who's
awakening.

683
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,639
We started
to miss.

684
00:59:43,654 --> 00:59:45,278
Wait
one second

685
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,972
What percent
we achieved?

686
00:59:48,973 --> 00:59:52,811
You'll be happy to know that the last
coup has given us 48%

687
00:59:54,244 --> 00:59:55,859
So we go over 6%
to 54%.

688
00:59:56,455 --> 00:59:58,090
Alright!
Alright!

689
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:00,303
Let's wrap this up

690
01:00:01,074 --> 01:00:03,767
Let's go beyond 6%
this time

691
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:05,663
What?

692
01:00:06,218 --> 01:00:09,018
No, all voted,
agreed 6% ...

693
01:00:09,019 --> 01:00:11,120
We did another vote.
you were out

694
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:12,421
Then, we vote for you.

695
01:00:12,422 --> 01:00:14,573
You've been very generous offer
the way you did.

696
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:16,316
Fuck you!

697
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:19,335
Damn you all to hell!

698
01:00:23,735 --> 01:00:26,634
Do not worry.

699
01:00:26,635 --> 01:00:29,435
We will not do anything
that we've done.

700
01:00:30,511 --> 01:00:32,542
We voted, pig!

701
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:34,989
Not just me.

702
01:00:36,255 --> 01:00:39,450
Do not ...

703
01:00:39,451 --> 01:00:42,128
Motherfuckers!

704
01:00:44,214 --> 01:00:45,710
He knows something.

705
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:47,830
Why do not you tell us?

706
01:00:48,131 --> 01:00:49,707
Why do not you tell us?

707
01:00:50,702 --> 01:00:52,114
It's a drug dealer!

708
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:55,523
It's a drug dealer.
He sells this shit! It's him!

709
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,459
Is it, why not
hear me?

710
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,945
No need to do that.
Let's do it ourselves.

711
01:01:09,946 --> 01:01:11,603
Try to relax.

712
01:01:20,212 --> 01:01:21,528
Kai!

713
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,201
My God!

714
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,835
My God, Kai!

715
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:34,187
My God!

716
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:38,399
My God!

717
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,900
Nick!

718
01:01:44,251 --> 01:01:45,762
God.

719
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,800
Open your eyes.

720
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:16,862
- Son of a bitch!
-Tony, no! We need it!

721
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,491
Thank you.

722
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:33,546
She is mine.

723
01:02:33,547 --> 01:02:35,406
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

724
01:02:37,975 --> 01:02:41,989
Sorry!
It was an accident!

725
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:44,783
It was an accident!
I would never have done that!

726
01:02:44,784 --> 01:02:46,958
Sorry!

727
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:50,044
-I never did it on purpose.
-Keep the head.

728
01:02:50,045 --> 01:02:52,712
Sorry!

729
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:56,963
There

730
01:04:44,163 --> 01:04:45,465
Well ..

731
01:04:46,455 --> 01:04:49,242
I do not think we can
get any more of it.

732
01:04:49,243 --> 01:04:51,139
- Really?.
We have no more time-

733
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,055
We have to do something fast.

734
01:04:53,379 --> 01:04:54,727
Right.

735
01:04:55,763 --> 01:04:57,550
We will follow the plan.

736
01:04:58,222 --> 01:05:00,666
'I'll go first.
-No, Lisa is right.

737
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:03,220
We do not have enough time
to do it this way.

738
01:05:03,854 --> 01:05:05,180
If.

739
01:05:06,283 --> 01:05:09,374
- What else can we do?
-We will do as a group.

740
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:11,370
Three simultaneously.
Everyone helps.

741
01:05:12,606 --> 01:05:16,159
There is only 16%. It's more of
2% for each and go.

742
01:05:16,588 --> 01:05:19,559
I do not think Greg
can help.

743
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,902
Those pills
have greatly affected.

744
01:05:21,903 --> 01:05:23,300
Well,
five of us then.

745
01:05:23,301 --> 01:05:25,743
No matter, but
we must do it at once.

746
01:05:28,922 --> 01:05:31,670
Does anyone have any suggestions?

747
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:39,488
When I was a kid,
I broke my collarbone.

748
01:05:40,243 --> 01:05:42,199
Nothing hurts so much.

749
01:05:43,118 --> 01:05:44,826
Can you use your arms?

750
01:05:48,956 --> 01:05:52,503
Okay, so ...
Who will do the honors?

751
01:05:54,607 --> 01:05:55,971
I will.

752
01:06:14,816 --> 01:06:16,122
Are you ready?

753
01:06:17,078 --> 01:06:18,687
Does it matter?

754
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:20,582
This is gonna hurt.

755
01:06:22,802 --> 01:06:24,186
I think so.

756
01:06:42,934 --> 01:06:44,466
All right.

757
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,243
Very well.

758
01:06:49,279 --> 01:06:50,588
Very well.

759
01:06:57,331 --> 01:06:59,058
Do it in me.

760
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:01,603
No!
Please, I can do it!

761
01:07:01,604 --> 01:07:03,990
Please not her.

762
01:07:09,479 --> 01:07:11,095
My turn.

763
01:07:12,216 --> 01:07:13,915
It's what she would have wanted.

764
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:38,426
Congratulations!
I knew I could do it.

765
01:07:38,427 --> 01:07:41,929
They are on the verge of
regain their freedom. 

766
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:45,920
In the room, the door
front, find a retractor. 

767
01:07:45,921 --> 01:07:47,867
Pull the same and the machine

768
01:07:47,868 --> 01:07:50,686
 remove the devices.
- Fuck you!

769
01:07:50,687 --> 01:07:53,172
Let's get out of here!

770
01:07:53,173 --> 01:07:56,918
And everyone will leave
here as promised.

771
01:07:56,919 --> 01:07:59,494
Thank you again,
for your cooperation.

772
01:07:59,495 --> 01:08:03,189
And I wish all
a long and happy life.

773
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:49,278
Right. Release me!

774
01:09:00,195 --> 01:09:01,505
Right.

775
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:03,191
Very well.

776
01:09:03,192 --> 01:09:05,770
Then we have
to be fast, right?

777
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:08,254
I'll be there
and help them to go, right?

778
01:09:15,743 --> 01:09:17,158
Care.

779
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:19,731
Right. Care.

780
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:23,482
Well, watch out.

781
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:32,275
Do not smile yet.
I'm not done with you.

782
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,718
You should not let
this place.

783
01:09:38,502 --> 01:09:39,851
You're next,
companion.

784
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:43,298
Bring the
Kai body?

785
01:11:22,558 --> 01:11:23,918
Come on, honey.

786
01:11:29,959 --> 01:11:31,291
Let's move on.

787
01:11:33,518 --> 01:11:35,474
Are you ready, Sam?

788
01:11:35,475 --> 01:11:36,835
You can send it.

789
01:11:38,526 --> 01:11:39,855
I have it.

790
01:11:57,703 --> 01:12:01,263
Damn it! Nick! Nick!

791
01:12:01,779 --> 01:12:04,075
See, I help
Greg pass.

792
01:12:04,076 --> 01:12:06,727
- Are you sure? Going to be okay?
'I'll be right behind you.

793
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,491
I love you.
-You too.

794
01:12:18,492 --> 01:12:21,216
Wait, take this.
not know about the other side.

795
01:12:32,863 --> 01:12:34,974
It was him! It was him!

796
01:12:44,383 --> 01:12:46,142
No!

797
01:12:47,259 --> 01:12:49,578
It's him.

798
01:12:49,579 --> 01:12:52,790
It's him.
I know.

799
01:12:54,642 --> 01:12:56,138
You have to stop.

800
01:12:58,658 --> 01:13:00,348
-Stop it
-Back for you.

801
01:13:05,738 --> 01:13:08,700
'You could help too.
'I'm trying

802
01:13:08,701 --> 01:13:10,003
My leg is ...

803
01:13:10,004 --> 01:13:11,800
'Wait here.
-God!

804
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:13,101
Sorry.

805
01:13:13,102 --> 01:13:15,407
What are you doing?

806
01:13:17,799 --> 01:13:19,919
Give me a minute.

807
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:22,863
All we need
is to loosen the tension.

808
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:26,883
Would you take
or you leave here?

809
01:13:29,211 --> 01:13:30,979
Never mind.

810
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,486
They found me
whatever happens.

811
01:13:35,896 --> 01:13:38,239
Who?
Who will you find?

812
01:13:39,462 --> 01:13:43,367
I did not think rumors
were true.

813
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:47,154
I thought they were just stories
they had.

814
01:13:47,907 --> 01:13:50,007
Do you really know who did
this with us?

815
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:51,847
She said ...

816
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:55,522
She said that 10 000
by pills, but ...

817
01:13:56,643 --> 01:13:59,182
Any dealer
pay 12 mil.

818
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,191
Easy.

819
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:07,489
People will pay any price,
no matter where you come.

820
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:11,742
You're part of this?
Were you one of them?

821
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:13,662
No.

822
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,414
I only sell

823
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,307
I did not know.

824
01:14:24,234 --> 01:14:28,138
I did not think rumors
were true.

825
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:35,600
Who would think that people
I do this to other people

826
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:37,434
just to get money?

827
01:14:37,435 --> 01:14:39,306
shit!

828
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:50,331
I know.

829
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:56,806
I know I do not deserve it,
but, please, take me out.

830
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,699
You deserve it.

831
01:15:27,271 --> 01:15:29,190
Hello Welcome
my house

832
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,023
No! No! No!

833
01:15:32,024 --> 01:15:34,846
No way!
No way!

834
01:15:35,684 --> 01:15:38,398
But I can assure
if they work together,

835
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:40,387
 out of here
soon.

836
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:41,923
Damn it!

837
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,495
What are you doing, Nick?

838
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:57,002
You should go back
with your friends.

839
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,980
How could you do that?

840
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,931
No lights good friend

841
01:16:03,932 --> 01:16:06,475
Let me tell you something.
If you leave now

842
01:16:06,476 --> 01:16:08,646
I let you get back to
Tay ..

843
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,491
You dare not speak its name.

844
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,355
Want to see what you are doing
at this time?

845
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,582
Please let her go.

846
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:14,774
I can not.

847
01:17:15,185 --> 01:17:16,970
You do not understand, do you?

848
01:18:19,213 --> 01:18:22,085
Congratulations. Sabia
you could do it.

849
01:18:22,086 --> 01:18:24,723
You are one step away from
regain their freedom.

850
01:18:26,524 --> 01:18:29,080
My offer still stands.
Go and say goodbye to her.

851
01:18:29,081 --> 01:18:30,400
Fuck.

852
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:35,004
Very well.
Do what you want

853
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,000
Sorry.

854
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:48,600
Everyone can leave
here as promised.

855
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:51,510
Thanks again
for your cooperation.

856
01:18:51,511 --> 01:18:55,188
I wish you a long
and happy life.

857
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,693
I know, man.
is difficult.

858
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,800
It's hard.

859
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,900
You are about to die

860
01:19:17,901 --> 01:19:19,701
You could be saying goodbye
your girlfriend

861
01:19:19,702 --> 01:19:22,016
but you're here with me

862
01:19:23,407 --> 01:19:26,752
Incidentally, probably
this takes about 10 minutes

863
01:19:26,753 --> 01:19:28,548
to kill,
so ...

864
01:19:28,643 --> 01:19:32,582
Okay, I know ...
I said it a hundred times,

865
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:35,834
she should use a chemical
with faster reaction, but ...

866
01:19:35,835 --> 01:19:38,767
These guys are
some sick bastards

867
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,453
You know that you
are my fifth group?

868
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:44,827
I did not think that would
until now.

869
01:19:44,828 --> 01:19:47,406
Further considering the
feelings each other.

870
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,235
Except for Tara, man.

871
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,399
What girl does not?

872
01:19:54,438 --> 01:19:57,343
When your girlfriend
she was pregnant ...

873
01:19:58,206 --> 01:20:00,850
Seriously, I had to leave ...
I almost had to stop.

874
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,310
mate ...

875
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,489
Tony.

876
01:21:24,789 --> 01:21:26,289
Come!

877
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,928
I do not even know why I
takes the trouble to look.

878
01:23:02,929 --> 01:23:04,961
knows
asked to waffles.

879
01:23:04,962 --> 01:23:07,700
Maybe not. Maybe I want
try something new ..

880
01:23:07,701 --> 01:23:09,414
Yes, but you do not want.

881
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,957
What is the dish of the day?

882
01:23:13,999 --> 01:23:17,689
Very well. Well,
fried eggs with toast ...

883
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:19,289
No, no eggs.

884
01:23:19,902 --> 01:23:22,589
-Baguette with cheese?
-No ...

885
01:23:23,409 --> 01:23:25,307
I learned they are pretty good.

886
01:23:25,801 --> 01:23:28,288
Just good enough?

887
01:23:28,778 --> 01:23:31,057
Well, we're famous
for our waffles ..

888
01:23:31,579 --> 01:23:32,926
Really?

889
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,389
Brilliant
Then ask that.

890
01:23:35,689 --> 01:23:37,189
Egghead

891
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:38,917
Completed the other?

892
01:23:39,753 --> 01:23:41,123
If.

893
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:43,213
That must have hurt.

894
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,314
It could have been worse.

895
01:23:45,315 --> 01:23:46,849
I do not like needles.

896
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,040
But they are beautiful.

897
01:23:50,689 --> 01:23:52,989
He is in love
of dolphins, right?

898
01:23:56,389 --> 01:23:57,689
If ...

899
01:24:02,489 --> 01:24:04,989
Sure ...
Be right back.

900
01:24:48,889 --> 01:24:50,989
-There you go.
-Thanks.

901
01:24:51,289 --> 01:24:53,096
Thank you so much.

902
01:24:53,097 --> 01:24:56,689
Wait a second, I'll look
some samples for his wife.

903
01:24:56,989 --> 01:24:59,307
You do not know women too
married right?

904
01:24:59,308 --> 01:25:00,689
Have a good night.

905
01:25:01,389 --> 01:25:02,916
Wait a second!

906
01:25:03,354 --> 01:25:04,660
Damn it!

907
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:06,489
Damn it!

908
01:25:06,789 --> 01:25:08,541
Redneck Damn!

909
01:25:10,475 --> 01:25:12,237
What a waste.

910
01:25:53,889 --> 01:25:55,389
I love this song.
