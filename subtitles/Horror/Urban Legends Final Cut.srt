00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,999
- Move, move, move.
- Come on.

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,740
Tell me again why we chose this
over seeing the movie.

6
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,378
If these guys lose focus for even a millisecond.....

7
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:22,081
.....you have to scrape them off the fence
with a shovel. A shovel.

8
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,783
You come here hoping to see a crash?

9
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,784
No, I would like to see them complete-
Of course it's to see a crash.

10
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,487
- You're sick, Hunt.
- Come on!

11
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,499
Look, here comes Nick with our stuff.

12
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:41,801
- Hey, bud.
- There he is.

13
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:42,801
Yes.

14
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:46,804
- Hi, babe.
- Hey.

15
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,175
Oh, my God. Ha, ha.

16
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,577
- Uh, time to lay off the Funyuns, Nicky boy.
- Oh, thanks, buddy.

17
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,816
- Ah, great.
- Yeah! All right!

18
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,619
- Oh, my God.
- Oh. Here. Want a drink?

19
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,620
- Oh. Is that straight-up Jack?
- It's his buddy Jim.

20
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,025
- Maybe later, yeah?
- Hey, sport.

21
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,793
Can my girl use your binoculars?

22
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,999
Well, they're not really binoculars exactly.
They're more.....

23
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:17,034
Drink as much as you like.

24
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,039
Go, go, go.

25
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,978
Whoa. Easy, fellas.

26
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:29,979
Craig Perry shuts the door
as "Mark Helfrich" tries to overtake him.

27
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,219
Hey, thanks for making me
take a study break.

28
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,220
I really, really needed this.

29
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,826
Excuse me. Pardon me.

30
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,901
That was a close call..

31
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,739
Well, great. What did I just miss?

32
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,740
- Can you see, ma'am?
- I'm sorry, not really.

33
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:00,077
- Would you like me to move down a bit?
- Would you mind?

34
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,681
- Be glad to.
- Thanks, man.

35
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,682
- Thank you.
- And I thought chivalry was dead.

36
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:08,851
- Heh. That's not true.
- I have my cowboy right here.

37
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:11,922
Get a room, guys.

38
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,598
Hey. Put these in.

39
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,934
- Oh, Mom, not tampons.
- Put these- Put them in.

40
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:24,935
Nick. Nick.

41
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:27,773
- This tickles.
- Aw, Mom.

42
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,743
- No, no, no.
- She put tampons in their ears.

43
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,078
That's just wrong, man.

44
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,580
I can't see now.

45
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,515
Hey, down in front, asshole.

46
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,516
Approaching the halfway point.

47
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,792
There goes the neighborhood.

48
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,263
Sir.

49
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,365
- I need you to move your foot.
- Thank you.

50
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,149
Hey, how old is this place?

51
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,150
You got me.

52
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,320
- Come on, let's go.
- Go, go, go.

53
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,090
Tire up.

54
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,091
What's that?

55
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,295
Is it safe to sit here?

56
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:59,296
- Of course. There's a fence there.
- We're fine.

57
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:00,016
Relax.

58
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:08,205
Replay of the Camping World Regional
Series race......

59
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:11,275
.....is on the Replay Race Channel
at 3 P.M.

60
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,711
Did you feel that?

61
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,913
Just now, right here.

62
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:49,415
You okay?

63
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:54,000
Uh, I felt "something" touch me.
"Something" strange.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,087
For those of you
with a business-minded head...

65
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,598
Go, go.

66
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,329
Come on, come on, come on.

67
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,903
- Two's good.
- Go, go, go.

68
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:15,939
No, no, no, wait! The screwdriver! Shit!

69
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,060
Oh.

70
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,485
Come on, come on. Let's go, go, go!

71
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,616
Come on.

72
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,413
Move!

73
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,839
Go. Get the fuck out of here.

74
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,646
- Come on.
- Boys, wait!

75
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:30,647
Come on, Mom.

76
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,184
Mom!

77
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,872
Hey! Hey! There's an exit this way!

78
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:56,873
Come on, move.

79
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,391
- Hunt!
- Janet!

80
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,894
- Let's move. Come on.
- There's an exit over here. Come on.

81
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,868
Come on, come on! This way! Run!

82
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:24,136
- Lori!
- Move!

83
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,414
Lori. Lori, come on, let's go!
Get out of here!

84
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,415
Move! Push through!

85
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,716
Come on!

86
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,899
Ow. Hey. What the hell?

87
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,504
Are you okay?

88
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,505
Nick, is there something wrong?

89
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,109
Oh, my God, is that straight-up Jack?

90
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:07,110
- No, no, it's his-
- His buddy Jim.

91
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,950
- You have been in my stash.
- You snake.

92
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,619
A cowboy in a hat. He sits here.

93
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,388
Excuse me. Pardon me.

94
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,357
Oh, ha, ha.

95
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,197
Cowboy.

96
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,096
Tampons. She gets tampons.
She puts them in her kids ears.

97
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,131
- Who?
- Her, right there.

98
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,567
Hey. Put these in your ears.

99
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,303
- Oh, Mom, not tampons.
- Put them in your ear.

100
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:33,472
Hey, how did you know
she was gonna do that?

101
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,308
That's a lot of tampons for one woman.

102
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:40,309
- Nick? Nick.
- What's going on?

103
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,415
"Down" something. "Down...
Down in- Down in front, asshole. "

104
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,919
Down in front, asshole.

105
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,157
There goes the neighborhood.

106
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,894
Sir. I need you to move your foot.

107
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,267
Thank you.

108
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,069
- Let's go.
- Move it.

109
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:07,070
Go. Pick up the tire.

110
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,475
That's the car that's gonna crash.

111
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,510
- We have to get out of here.
- Thank God.

112
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,246
- What? No, no. I got $500 on this race.
- No one cares about.....

113
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,400
We got to get the fuck out of here. Okay.
There's something going to happen.

114
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,619
We're all gonna die, alright. There's gonna be a
crash. What? Hey, kid, that ain't funny.

115
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:23,188
- We got to go right now. We got to move.
- Relax, Nick. All Right.

116
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:26,189
- Nick, calm down.
- Oh, my God.

117
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,993
What's your problem, bro?
Get off of me, man.

118
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,198
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait. Boys, wait!

119
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,468
I'm gonna kick your little ass, you pussy!

120
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,206
Goddamn it!

121
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:42,975
God, you little punk.

122
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,976
- Andy.
- Stay there.

123
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,716
- Come back here, kid!
- Hey, you little prick!

124
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:55,154
- Wha...What...Are you out of your mind?
- I saw the whole thing.

125
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,689
- There's gonna be a huge crash.
- Of course there's a crash.

126
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,057
There's always a fucking crash.

127
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:01,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What crash?

128
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,564
That fucking crash.
That's what crash I'm talking about.

129
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,999
Are you shitting me? That's the reason
I come to these stupid redneck things.

130
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,038
No offense.

131
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:16,039
- Sir. No, no, no-
- But my wife's in there, asshole!

132
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,744
- No, you can't.
- Let me go! I gotta find her!

133
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,913
- Dude, relax.
- That's my wife!

134
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,748
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

135
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,749
Have you all lost your fucking mind?

136
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,671
Ew!

137
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,121
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

138
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,492
- Just a second.
- That's okay.

139
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,342
Nick, was it like a dream
or like a voice in your head?

140
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,179
I just... I just saw it.

141
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,883
- Can we just try to forget about it?
- Are you kidding?

142
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,121
I am never gonna get that image
out of my head.

143
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:46,722
- I mean, that girl's face just-
- Janet. Look, I know it's difficult.

144
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:50,459
- We're all a little freaked out, okay?
- But why are we still alive?

145
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,998
Who cares why? Okay?

146
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,999
If we made it, we deserved it.

147
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,404
Hunt, will you give the lucky-coin shit
a rest, please?

148
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,309
Guys, look.

149
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,722
- I think we should go to the memorial.
- I can't.

150
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,026
- I can't go back there, Lori.
- Yeah, screw that.

151
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,428
I mean, at least we can do is pay our
respects to those people.

152
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:24,996
What people?

153
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:27,997
People who didn't have a Dr. Xavier with
them to tell them to get out of the way?

154
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,901
People who didn't have one of these?

155
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,374
Go ahead, Janet. Kiss it.

156
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,375
It's your choice, heads or tails,

Hi, I was hoping you would come.

Because of your warning,
we're alive and our two sons are safe.

...Carter Daniels lived quietly
in Fort Wayne.

Details are sketchy
on how Daniels was killed.

is that a tow truck somehow dragged him...

before the truck exploded.

It was like a vision.

for this. Good.

314
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:41,912
But it wasn't a dream.

315
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:45,500
It was like these "random sounds
and images".

316
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,900
They really didn't make any sense.
And then I read what killed them......

317
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,920
......and I realized that I'd actually seen
how the next person was going to die.

318
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,692
Wait, what do you mean,
"the next person"?

319
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:58,964
Okay, don't laugh,
but we stayed up Googling premonitions...

320
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:03,964
...visions, signs, things like that, just to see
how much information we could get.

321
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,270
There are tons of articles about people...

322
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,372
...who had a premonition
about a disaster...

323
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:11,042
...they saved themselves...

324
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,376
...and then they died.

325
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:15,046
Okay, so people died. So what?

326
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,315
Every survivor died.

327
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,217
In the precise order they were meant to die
in the accident.

328
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:22,219
Well, we survived.

329
00:30:22,219 --> 00:30:25,220
So now does that mean we all die?

330
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,559
- Well, who's next?
- I don't remember.

331
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,964
But there might be an out.

332
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:36,334
Some say the chain can be broken.

333
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,335
Like if you were to intervene
into someone else's death...

334
00:30:39,335 --> 00:30:40,571
...that would end it.

335
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:43,307
But others say
unless the chain is broken completely...

336
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:47,700
.....then you're just changing the batting
order, and sooner or later, you're up.

337
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,150
- That is some "spooky psychobabble" shit.
- shut up, please. This is not funny.

338
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,421
I'm just saying he could be watching a ton
of TV. You know what this stuff does to me.

339
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,421
Janet, it's okay. All we're trying to do
is just figure out what's going on. No.

340
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:01,992
Okay. You guys are gonna have to
figure that out without me.

341
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:04,993
Maybe you can call me later, but I
got to go. Hope you have fun.

342
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:07,031
Janet, come back. Don't leave.

343
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,000
No, Lori. No.

344
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,769
You guys are freaking me out. What's with
that? She went from uptight but normal...

345
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,437
...to uptight and totally insane.

346
00:31:13,437 --> 00:31:16,207
Why you gotta be a prick all the time?
She saw somebody die right in front of her.

347
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,943
- So did we.
- Yeah, and we're all freaked out.

348
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,944
Would it kill you to be sensitive?

349
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,348
I don't know.

350
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:26,617
I've never tried it.

351
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:28,052
Where are you going?

352
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,053
If you're right
about this whole crash thing...

353
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,390
...then I'm going to make the most
of every moment I have left.

354
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,459
- So, I am going to do, what I do best.
- I am going to go get laid.

355
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,865
If I'm dying, I'm trying.

356
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,866
Keep up the good fight, guys.

357
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,445
And if I happen to bump into Janet,
I will check on her.

358
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:54,285
Thanks.

359
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,229
Well, that went well.

360
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:15,230
Yeah, our friends think we're crazy.
It's great.

361
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,468
Well, maybe we are.

362
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,469
Look, they're probably
just some weird coincidences.

363
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:25,574
You think?

364
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,945
I hope so.

365
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,658
Nick? What did you see?

366
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,795
- I think we can stop it.
- How?

367
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,199
We got to go to the racetrack.

368
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,876
Oh, my God.

369
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,845
Look at this place.

370
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,214
All those people just...

371
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,816
- I don't wanna be here.
- I know, I know.

372
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:08,817
But this is the only thing that I can
think of to help me remember the order.

373
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,722
It's over here. This is where we were.

374
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,466
Let's see if this works.

375
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,371
The mechanic's girlfriend dies first.

376
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,981
Then that racist and his wife.

377
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:54,663
That woman with the kids, she was next.

378
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,872
Let's go. We shouldn't be here. Let's go.

379
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,385
I can't remember who dies when.

380
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,954
- It's okay.
- I don't know what to do. I can't...

381
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,623
Maybe this was a really bad idea.

382
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:20,373
No.

383
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,594
I got to try.

384
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,133
You better have a damn good reason
for trespassing.

385
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,435
I just need to remember the order.

386
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:35,999
Young man, that sounds crazy.
But maybe this will help you.

387
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,746
Now, this will bring up
all our video cameras right here.

388
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,161
There.

389
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,162
That's where that guy
in the mechanic jacket dies.

390
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,499
- so he's next, then.
- I think so.

391
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,806
That collapse kills Hunt and Janet.

392
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,311
And that's when you die.

393
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,682
And then Lori.

394
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,146
Then me.

395
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,300
Hey, maybe if we can stop this mechanic from
getting killed, we can break the chain...

396
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,665
...and the rest of us will be safe.

397
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,934
But how?
I mean, we don't even know his name.

398
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:41,935
- We know nothing about him.
- But we do know where he works.

399
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,808
Grandstate Customs.

400
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:47,344
Gotta finish up that differential.

401
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:50,114
Bond that to the fibreglass on it.

402
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,316
- Done with that impact?
- Yeah, hold on a second.

403
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,163
- You just want that spot-welded, right?
- Yeah.

404
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,803
Hey, can you give me a hand
with this test probe?

405
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,541
Good stuff, man.

406
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,591
- Hey!
- Are you okay?

407
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:37,592
Who's the fucking moron?

408
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,764
You. What are you doing here?

409
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,266
Trying to find you.

410
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:46,404
Look, man, I'm sorry for being blunt, but your
life's in danger and I think you're gonna die.

411
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,650
Three of the people who left that stadium
before that accident happened....

412
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,775
.....they're now dead.

413
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:54,776
I'm sorry,
but we think that you're gonna be next.

414
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,247
You're serious?

415
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:58,582
Andy.

416
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:02,954
- You know you can't have these people in here.
- Take them outside. All right, No visitors in here.

417
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,034
Let's go.

418
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,200
Look, man, I'm trying to put "my" life
back together, okay?

419
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,999
I mean, watching Nadia die like that
in front of me.....

420
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,985
Hey, I know exactly how you feel.

421
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:37,921
I lost my wife and my daughter
in a car accident.

422
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:40,922
I was driving and I was drunk.

423
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:46,426
Every day, I ask "myself" how come
it couldn't be me instead of them.

424
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:53,600
For a long time,
I carried so much pain and anger.....

425
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,999
.....it was actually destroying their memory.
So now I try to live each day in their name.

426
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:08,283
Hey, guys, Look, I hate to break it to you,
but right now I'm getting a really bad feeling.

427
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,753
Look, kid,
I'm around dangerous equipment every day.

428
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:14,856
If I was meant to die,
it would have happened by now.

429
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,165
Look out!

430
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,136
- Holy shit.
- You okay, Andy?

431
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:29,137
Yeah, I'm okay.

432
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:32,009
Well, I guess it's not my turn to die.

433
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,010
You all take care.

434
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,188
Holy....!
You all right?

435
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,656
Show us 20 at the body shop.

436
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,958
Honey, I mean,
if you can stop the next death...

437
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,327
...I'm seeing these clues,
but I can't piece them together at all.

438
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:52,629
- You got to think. Who's next?
- I don't know.

439
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:54,331
We have to warn your friends.

440
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,233
- How?
- Well, which one is next?

441
00:38:56,233 --> 00:39:00,572
- They both die in the collapse. I don't know.
- Nick, think. Focus.

442
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:04,172
One of them had to be first, even if it
was one second before the other one.

443
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,210
Was it Hunt, or was it Janet?

444
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,349
You got to find Janet.

445
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:15,350
I'm gonna find Hunt. Okay?

446
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,542
Oh, God. Faster, go faster.

447
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,883
That's it. Go faster, go faster. Pick it up, pick
it up. Don't be lazy. little bit faster, faster.

448
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:48,419
Stop moving, stop moving, stop moving.
Come on. Move. Oh!

449
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:52,390
No, come on. Wake up.
No, we're not done. I'm not done.

450
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,057
Come on.

451
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:54,897
No, no.

452
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,562
Are you fucking kidding me?

453
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,466
I finished, like, four minutes ago.

454
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:05,467
- Ever play "Donkey Punch"?
- Dick.

455
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,999
Excuse me, miss,
but could you help a struggling artist?

456
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,854
Sure.

457
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,344
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

458
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:52,347
Let's see what we got here, Browning.

459
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,918
A penny? That's some bullshit.

460
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:03,525
Oh, damn it.

461
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,086
Great.

462
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:27,382
Come on, you custom piece of shit.

463
00:41:31,356 --> 00:41:34,000
Come on, pick up the phone. Come on.

464
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,058
Aah. Where are you at? Come on.

465
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,920
This is Hunt. You know what to do.

466
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,999
- Hunt, listen to me, buddy, listen.
- No water, okay? Stay away from water.

467
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,366
You have three messages marked urgent.

468
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:29,444
That's funny, huh?

469
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,450
- Give me the gun.
- No, ha, ha.

470
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,119
Give me the fucking gun.

471
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:36,869
No.

472
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:53,802
Fucked up my phone.

473
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,555
Shit.

474
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:07,671
Perfect.

475
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,558
Hey, Lori, I'm at the car wash.
I'll call you back in five.

476
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,060
Janet, wait. Wait. Shit.

477
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,363
Do you know if there's a car wash
around here?

478
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:29,364
- Yeah, there's one on 18th.
- We gotta go there.

479
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:36,738
Yes. I own you, machine.

480
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:10,507
Lori?

481
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:13,443
- What's so important?
- Don't go near water. What?

482
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:14,611
What? Wait! Water?

483
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,080
- What? Don't go near water!
- Water? Lori?

484
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,081
Wait. Lori?

485
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,216
Shit.

486
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,648
No service.

487
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:52,898
Shit.

488
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,225
Come on, come on, come on.

489
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:07,591
Come on.

490
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,002
Lord, No.

491
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:12,722
Close!

492
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,507
Oh, stop it! Oh, my God, no!

493
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,179
Oh, God! Help me!

494
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,293
Please! Somebody, please!

495
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,135
Pick up the phone, Janet.

496
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,871
Oh, God! Help!

497
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:50,872
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

498
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,550
We're almost there.

499
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,124
Oh, shit. Fore!

500
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:14,622
No, no, no.

501
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,093
- There it is.
- Hurry.

502
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,905
Go around back, George. She's in there.

503
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,560
No!

504
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,925
Go, go, go!

505
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:54,764
Lori! Lori, get me out of here!
I am coming.

506
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:57,765
- Shit. I'm coming. Just hold on.
- Come on, get her out.

507
00:48:57,765 --> 00:49:00,935
- Lori, help me!
- I'm trying!

508
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,641
Come here, I got you. I got you.

509
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:29,849
Hunt.

510
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:14,143
- So do you have insurance?
- Yeah.

511
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:17,144
What are we supposed to do now?

512
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,848
I mean, what's gonna happen to us?

513
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,719
You know,
saving Janet either destroyed death's list...

514
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,999
...and all of us are home free,
or it skips her for now and then.....

515
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,663
And I'm next.

516
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,932
George, you can't give up.

517
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:38,933
- No, it's okay.
- What do you mean, "it's okay"?

518
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,999
- I mean, maybe if we all stick together...
- No, I'm at peace with it.

519
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,207
And, um, my family's waiting for me.

520
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,512
I'm ready to go.

521
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,772
When we're done in here, we need to
make sure to safe-proof the bedroom next.

522
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,012
I don't understand
how George can be so calm about things.

523
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,516
- Maybe he was in shock.
- No, that's not it.

524
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:07,800
It was very clear. It's...
It's like he just accepted it.

525
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,925
I think he's given up.

526
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,464
If he dies, I'm next.

527
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,465
And when that happens,
maybe you should just keep your distance.

528
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:20,534
Babe, what are you talking about?
Come on.

529
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:24,774
I don't want anything to happen to you.

530
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,775
And if we're together, it makes it easier
for death to take both of us.

531
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,479
I don't care what happens.
We are in this together.

532
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:40,373
Look.

533
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,296
Maybe no one else has to die.

534
00:52:47,296 --> 00:52:50,233
We should go tell George.

535
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:53,123
Hello?

536
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,681
George.

537
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:04,879
We think saving Janet broke the chain.

538
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,760
George?

539
00:53:31,108 --> 00:53:34,108
- George?
- George?

540
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,999
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- No. George.....

541
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:46,400
Oh, my God. Are you crazy?
After everything that we have been through.

542
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,424
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Why are you trying to kill yourself?

543
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,727
I am just trying to give God
what I thought he wanted.

544
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,728
I have been trying to kill myself all day.

545
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,266
Took a bottle of painkillers.
I just threw them up.

546
00:53:57,266 --> 00:54:00,267
Then I went to the garage,
hooked a hose from the tailpipe.....

547
00:54:00,267 --> 00:54:02,838
.....stuck it inside the car,
the car kept stalling.

548
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,480
Then...

549
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:09,839
So wait.

550
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,815
Saving Janet
must have destroyed the list, then.

551
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,258
I think congratulations are in order.

552
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:23,826
To breaking the chain.

553
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:26,827
- Apple cider?
- Thank you.

554
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,165
- Thank God.
- And a toast.

555
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,433
Mm-hm.

556
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,901
- To life.
- To life.

557
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,902
- To life.
- Yes.

558
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,340
Mm...

559
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,700
We have been given a second chance.
So, what are you guys gonna do with it?

560
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,513
- I have a few plans for us, ha, ha.
- Uh, oh-oh.

561
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:48,600
Lots of travelling, like Paris,
maybe "some beaches" St. Tropez.

562
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,685
I'm just thankful that we have our whole
lives ahead of us, you know?

563
00:54:51,685 --> 00:54:53,156
Yeah.

564
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:56,899
Now this is over, I am not going to take
another day for granted.

565
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:58,878
Ever.

566
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,963
You know, maybe it's time to stop talking
about doing stuff and actually start doing it.

567
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:08,301
- You only live once, right?
- That's what I'm talking about.

568
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:10,706
Let me get the cookies.

569
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,180
We made it.

570
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,020
We did.

571
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,634
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

572
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:41,237
- Hey, did you get the traveller's checks?
- Yes, I did.

573
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,039
We need anything from the mall?

574
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,907
No, I think we're good.

575
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:47,076
Are you sure you don't want to come
to the movie?

576
00:55:47,076 --> 00:55:49,645
- It's in 3-D.
- Love Lays Dying?

577
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:52,515
Yeah, I think I will be all right.
Sounds like a chickflick.

578
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,484
But, uh, I will have everything packed
by the time you get home.

579
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:58,087
Amsterdam, here we come.

580
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:01,088
I can't believe we're actually going.
Um, heh-

581
00:56:01,088 --> 00:56:04,191
You know, Janet is so incredibly jealous....

582
00:56:04,191 --> 00:56:07,063
...speaking of, she's walking up right now.
I'm going to run, okay?

583
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,698
- Alright, tell her I said hi.
- I will.

584
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,433
- Love you.
- Love you too. Be home soon.

585
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,934
- Bye.
- Bye.

586
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:14,935
- Hi.
- Hi, ha, ha.

587
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:50,571
John Doe, the unknown survivor
of the "Mckinley speedway" crash....

588
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:53,977
.....has finally been named
now that his family's been notified.

589
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,977
Jonathan Groves was rescued
in the rubble.

590
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,386
George, how fast can you meet me
at the hospital?

591
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,154
- Look, man, we got the order wrong.
- All Right.

592
00:57:05,154 --> 00:57:07,590
Remember that guy who sat in front of me
at the race? The cowboy?

593
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,999
He didn't die, alright which means he's next.
Look, just be there in five. Alright I'm on my way.

594
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,174
You feeling okay, Mr. Suby?

595
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:27,677
Ha. Why do you care?

596
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:31,481
You know how many of your kind
I killed in "Korea"?

597
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,016
- I'm Chinese, sir.
- Ha, same difference.

598
00:57:34,016 --> 00:57:36,185
I need you in PT 3 right now.

599
00:57:36,185 --> 00:57:37,853
- Okay.
- And I do mean now.

600
00:57:37,853 --> 00:57:39,522
- Okay.
- Thank you.

601
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,324
Be back in a few minutes
to get you into that tub.

602
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,163
Dr. Helfrich to Obstetrics.
Help.

603
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:50,164
Hey. Somebody. Hey. Help.
Dr. Marknel to Obstetrics.

604
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:53,367
Forgot to turn the water off.

605
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:54,617
Help.

606
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,142
Help. Somebody help.

607
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:05,147
- Dr. Finn, extension 2861.
- Somebody help.

608
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:07,683
Dr. Finn, extension 2861.

609
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,912
George. George.

610
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,250
Where is Lori?

611
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,488
- I have been calling and texting all afternoon.
- She's not picking up the phone.

612
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:47,488
Maybe it won't matter. Come on.

613
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:08,211
- So, how can there be someone else on the list?
- He didn't leave the racetrack with us.

614
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,750
Yeah. But if I would have asked him to move like
I did in the premonition, he would have died.

615
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,283
Instead, "He" survived.
That's why you couldn't kill yourself.

616
00:59:14,283 --> 00:59:17,253
You weren't next, he was.
It wasn't destined at all.

617
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:20,254
So if he dies, I am next again.

618
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,360
Great, man.

619
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,862
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Taylor to Pathology.

620
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:29,863
Dr. Sheila Taylor to Pathology.

621
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:52,471
Yeah.

622
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:24,200
- Those are really hot.
- Yes. I love these. I like how they....

623
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,489
- Ow!
- Aah! What the hell?

624
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:31,277
Ow!

625
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:35,696
Ugh, hey. Stop......

626
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,041
That's genius. Someone could get killed.

627
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:55,017
- Man, I am feeling something.
- Don't lose hope, man.

628
01:00:55,017 --> 01:00:58,018
I think we just keep an eye out for any signs
of danger, I think we got a shot. Okay.

629
01:00:58,018 --> 01:01:02,225
- Let's just go find Lori and Janet.
- No, no, not that. I mean, it's like "dejà vu"...

630
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,999
..My wife said that "dejà vu" is like
God's way of.....

631
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,830
- Oh, my goodness. Hurry, let's go.
- Okay.

632
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,347
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Okay, thanks.

633
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:28,050
Hi. I have...
Do you have these in a six?

634
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:30,519
Yes, we bring them in fresh every day.

635
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,555
- Hello.
- Oh!

636
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:34,190
- Cool, let's go.
- What do you think?

637
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,524
Ah...

638
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:38,525
Well, they're cute yet functional.

639
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,996
I like them.

640
01:01:40,996 --> 01:01:43,800
They say, "I am getting older,
but I still like to party."

641
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,735
Ha, ha, doesn't matter, I didn't buy them
for you, I bought them for Nick.

642
01:01:46,735 --> 01:01:49,736
He likes me in sneaks.

643
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:57,246
Yeah, just get a 2-by-48.

644
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:58,747
Right off the corner brace?

645
01:01:58,747 --> 01:02:00,549
Check the measurement. It's not fitting.

646
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:03,550
Those windows won't pass.

647
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,460
Yeah, 90 on that.

648
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:14,129
Yeah, that looks fine.

649
01:02:14,129 --> 01:02:15,999
Go ahead and nail it off, it's level.

650
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:19,568
Yeah, around the corner.

651
01:02:19,568 --> 01:02:21,470
- Lunch, boys.
- Okay.

652
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:24,471
Back in an hour.

653
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,115
Hey, Is that yoghurt place still open?

654
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:36,653
- Yeah, I think they're still here. Wait.
- Wait a second. My shoelace is caught in here.

655
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:38,587
- What? Oh!
- My shoelace is stuck.

656
01:02:38,587 --> 01:02:40,823
- Oh, okay, here.
- Just help me get it out.

657
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:43,824
- Look, I am going to grab your...... Whoa!
- It's not coming out, though, Janet.

658
01:02:43,824 --> 01:02:45,728
- Don't freak out. It's okay.
- Pull my leg harder.

659
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:48,230
Help me try to get it out. It need to pull.
It's not coming loose.

660
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:51,831
- I am trying. I am pulling.
- It's twisting my ankle. Ow! Ow!

661
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,355
Fuck.

662
01:02:57,574 --> 01:03:00,175
I should have seen that one coming.

663
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:03,176
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

664
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,660
Here is two for Love Lays Dying.
Enjoy the show.

665
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,661
- Alright. Thank you.
- Thanks. Good....

666
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,765
- Hi, ladies.
- Hello. Hi!

667
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,766
- Theatre 13, second door on your left.
- Thanks.

668
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,370
- So, what do you want?
- I don't know.

669
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,985
[SCREAMING PEOPLE]
Let's go.

670
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,166
- Hey!
- Where the hell you going?

671
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,780
- Go. Go. Go now.
- Cut him off.

672
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,590
- Are you fucking nuts?
- It's just up ahead. Be careful.

673
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:58,592
Hold on, pumpkin.
We will be there in no time.

674
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,029
That's really cool.

675
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,469
- Down in front, asshole.
- That's so ridiculous.

676
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:16,912
Sir, move your feet.

677
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:20,750
- Here, Put these in your ears.
- It's going to get loud.

678
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,651
What do you mean?

679
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:24,800
Look, don't get mad at me but...

680
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,487
....do you remember
when Nick said that he could see signs...

681
01:05:27,487 --> 01:05:29,892
...before something bad
was gonna happen?

682
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:32,628
Well, now I think I am seeing them.

683
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:37,600
Lori, it's over.
Nothing is going to happen.

684
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,600
- Now can we please watch the movie?
- I am going.

685
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:15,168
Are you kidding me?

686
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:26,613
- Everybody off this bridge.
- We will never make it. It's going to blow.

687
01:06:26,613 --> 01:06:28,283
Move it, now!

688
01:06:28,283 --> 01:06:31,284
Lori. Lori.

689
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,689
- Lori!
- Shut up, man.

690
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:36,690
Bye-bye, suckers.

691
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,541
"Dixieland."

692
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,176
- Something's wrong.
- Yeah, No kidding.

693
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,700
- The person next to me won't shut up.
- No, I'm serious. Something's wrong.

694
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,847
Things are happening
just like at the track.

695
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:17,230
- Lori, you in here?
- Nick.

696
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,768
- It's not over.
- What?

697
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:22,769
George is dead.

698
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,741
Janet, come on.
We have to leave right now.

699
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:28,742
No. No, I can't keep doing this, okay?
Everybody off this brigde....You're both nuts.

700
01:07:28,742 --> 01:07:32,500
- Janet, we got to go. Come on.
- No. Knock off. Don't you see?

701
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,200
This is where I was supposed to be in the first
place, not that stupid race. Shut the hell up.

702
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,789
- Come on. Wait. Come on.
- I was meant to see this movie.

703
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,789
Bye-bye, suckers.

704
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,072
Janet!

705
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,742
Lori, come on!

706
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:09,748
- Find the way to the exit. Move to the exit.
- Remain calm. Everything's going to be okay.

707
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:19,492
Let's go! Let's go!

708
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,580
- Help! I got you.
- Pull me up! Pull me up!

709
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,983
Nick! Nick!

710
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,785
- Help me! Help me!
- Hold on! Hold on!

711
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:47,155
- Climb up my arm!
- Don't let me go!

712
01:08:47,155 --> 01:08:49,524
Climb up my arm!

713
01:08:49,524 --> 01:08:54,525
- No! Hold on, I got you.
- I got you. Hold on. No.....

714
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:06,172
No, no, no!

715
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:12,711
- Lori, no! no, no.
- Lori, no! no, no.

716
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:19,388
I mean, it's dejà vu.

717
01:09:19,388 --> 01:09:25,328
- My wife said that dejà vu is like God's way.....
- I got you. Look out!

718
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,895
- Hurry.
- Get some help!

719
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:29,999
- Help me over here.
- Over here! Help. Lori!

720
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:39,141
Hey, watch it.

721
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:42,142
Down in front, asshole.

722
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,716
Hey, come on, man.

723
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,918
- Watch out.
- Hey.

724
01:09:49,918 --> 01:09:52,919
Hey, come on.

725
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:08,101
Janet, something's wrong.

726
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:41,970
Come on, come on, come on.

727
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:44,971
Uh, damn it.

728
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,087
Fuck! Oh!

729
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,550
- Look, we were wrong about the order before.
- What if we're wrong about breaking the chain?

730
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:42,297
Then we wouldn't be here at all.
shh...sh...shh....

731
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,633
And yet here I am, trying to watch a movie.
shh...sh...shh....

732
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,936
Despite my best friend going crazy next to me.
shh...sh...shh....

733
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:55,423
Oh, fuck.

734
01:11:58,181 --> 01:12:01,181
Oh, shit. Shit.

735
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,529
It's gonna blow. Move it!

736
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,207
Come on. Come on.

737
01:12:59,207 --> 01:13:02,208
Bye-bye, suckers.

738
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:21,196
I guess this is
how I am going to be remembered.

739
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,036
Thanks.

740
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,720
Try to tie it off right there.

741
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,156
That's good.

742
01:13:48,156 --> 01:13:49,925
Just this side of the Union City.

743
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,800
Hey, man, excuse me.
Is this thing supposed to be this way?

744
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,266
- Isn't it supposed to be screwed tighter?
- You're right.

745
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,668
Tell you what,
we will get somebody on that.

746
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:02,969
- Pays to be safe, man. Trust me.
- Yeah.

747
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:06,506
That's one down.

748
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:11,511
You want to meet up with them now?

749
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:23,692
- Small mint tea.
- Thanks.

750
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,294
- Small latte for you.
- Thank you.

751
01:14:26,294 --> 01:14:29,295
And for me...

752
01:14:29,295 --> 01:14:31,666
Um, what the hell is that?

753
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:35,604
This is a giant chococcino with whipped cream,
chocolate syrup, caramel and sprinkles.

754
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,105
That looks disgusting.

755
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:39,874
Yeah. I am going into a diabetic coma
just looking at it.

756
01:14:39,874 --> 01:14:42,875
Well, what can I say, ladies?
It looked good.

757
01:14:45,615 --> 01:14:48,916
Yeah, but it tastes totally disgusting.

758
01:14:51,721 --> 01:14:55,021
Say, you're the guy
who stopped that mall fire, aren't you?

759
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,325
You saved a lot of lives, man.

760
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,163
I was just at the right place
at the right time.

761
01:15:02,163 --> 01:15:05,864
Mm-hm.
Sometimes that's all it takes.

762
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,674
Okay, that was really weird.

763
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,410
- Hey, don't knock my fan base.
- Heh, God.

764
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,078
I love your bag, by the way.

765
01:15:17,078 --> 01:15:20,079
- Oh, thanks. Yeah. I actually just got it.
- Did you? Where?

766
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:23,051
Yeah. There's a place
right next to Brevig's. It just opened.

767
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,520
- Brevig's?
- Yeah, it's in that shopping center.

768
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,750
There's like a grocery store and a card shop
and then there's a......

769
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:31,326
- It's like a little accessories store.
- Oh, yeah.

770
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:35,698
It's super cute. yeah, tons of cute. If you want
one of these purses, they have it in plaid.

771
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,766
- Ha, ha, is that the only other one?
