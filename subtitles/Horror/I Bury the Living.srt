             WELCOME, SIR.

00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:00,567
             WELCOME TO         
         THE IMMORTAL HILLS.

                     THANK YOU. 

4
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:15,615
    IT'S ALL BY WAY             
 OF MAKING YOU FEEL             
 RIGHT AT HOME, BOBBY.          

5
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:18,151
 MR. CHAIRMAN.

     NOW, YOU KNOW.             

8
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:24,791
             OF COURSE, IT      
         ISN'T AS IF YOU WAS    
         ANY STRANGER HERE, BOB.

9
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:27,894
YES, BUT SOMEHOW                
THIS PLACE ALL LOOKS            
DIFFERENT TO ME.                

10
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:29,963
LIKE I NEVER                    
SAW IT BEFORE.                  

11
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,165
WELL, MAYBE I                   
NEVER HAD TO.                   

12
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:34,368
IT'S COLD AS                    
AN ICEBOX IN HERE.              

13
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,003
         THAT THING HASN'T      
         WORKED IN YEARS.       

14
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,337
        CEMENT, HOLES,          
     THE WET, YOU KNOW--        

15
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:39,806
        IT MAKES THE AIR        
     A WEE BIT CHRISTMASSY.     

16
00:02:39,874 --> 00:02:42,042
WON'T BOTHER YOU ANON           
ONCE YOU GET DOWN TO WORK.      

17
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,176
     I'M NOT SWORN IN YET.      

18
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:44,777
OH, THAT'S ONLY

OPPOSITE THE GATE.

TO MAKE A TOUR,                 

35
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:14,641
IT'S A BIT                      
WARMER OUTSIDE.                 

36
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,109
     THAT'S QUITE A MAP.

GATE YOU COME IN.

             UP TO DATE.

        THE MAP COMES IN.       

49
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,784

        QUICK AS A WINK,

00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,746
     NOW, FOR EXAMPLE--         

56
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:54,497
HERE'S MY PLACE.

         THAT GIVE SHADE        
     IN THE AFTERNOON HEAT.     

60

65
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,335

     AND THAT'S SOMETHING.      

68
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,142
                 ANYONE IN MIND 
                 TO REPLACE YOU?

00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:26,346
BUT, UH, WHY?                   

71
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,749

YOUNG AND HARD-MUSCLE TOUGHS    

72
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,851
WHO WOULD GIVE THEIR            
EYE TEETH FOR MY SHOES.         

73
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,418
 IT'S A LOVELY                  
PLACE TO WORK.

     THAT'S QUITE A MAP.        

78
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:48,201
 PARDON ME, SIR.

I JUST WANTED TO SHOW

IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES.         

81
00:04:52,807 --> 00:04:54,040
NO NEED TO WORRY, THOUGH--      

82
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:55,441
WE HAVEN'T HAD NONE YET.        

83
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:57,443
         [Bell rings]           

84
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,545
     OH, YOU EXPECTING          
        VISITORS, SIR?

             LIKE STU DREXEL.   

86
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,616
OH, AYE, DREXEL.

THEY'RE PROMISED.               

88
00:05:07,221 --> 00:05:09,055
            LOOKS LIKE          
         THEY'RE HITCHED.       

89
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:13,026
 HA HA HA. SHE FINALLY          
     CAUGHT ME, BOB.            

90
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,095
         BETHIE, MANY HAPPY     
         RETURNS OF THE DAY.    

91
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:17,130
        STU, YOU'VE PICKED      
     A GREAT HONEYMOON PLACE.   

92
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:19,099
 OH, MARRIAGE HAS MADE          
 ME CONSERVATIVE.               

93
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,466
     HOW ABOUT                  
     IT, MRS. D?                

94
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:22,102

 THE THRESHOLD?                 

95
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:24,070
I STILL DON'T THINK             
IT'S SO VERY FUNNY.             

96
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:26,940
I THINK IT'S POSITIVELY         
AWFUL IF YOU WANT               
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.              

97
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:28,441
        OH, BETHIE,             
    DON'T BE THAT WAY.          

98
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:29,976
         WHAT'S THE TROUBLE?    

99
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:33,013
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE              
TO GET A CEMETERY PLOT          
FOR A WEDDING GIFT?             

100
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,515
 NOW BETHIE, YOU

 IT FOR A PRESENT.              

101
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:38,251
 IT'S JUST A FORMAL             
 LEGAL SORT OF THING.           

102
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:40,053
YOU SEE, DAD LEFT PART          
 OF MY INHERITANCE              

103
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,755

     THE LAST I REMEMBER

     WAS THE VERY DAY

YEAH, I GUESS                   
THAT'S RIGHT.                   

245
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:08,431
I MUST HAVE PICKED UP           
THE WRONG COLOR.                

246
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:11,034
            HMM?                

247
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,401
                    OH, NOTHING.

248
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:14,003
                 IT'S JUST A    
                 LITTLE WEIRD,  
                 THAT'S ALL.    

249
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,206
                     WHAT?      

250
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,774
         WELL, THE KIDS         
         CAME OUT HERE          

251
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:20,410
        RIGHT AFTER THEY        
         TIED THE KNOT,         

252
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:22,545
         AND THEY BOUGHT        
         A COUPLE OF PLOTS.     

253
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:23,896
        STU WAS COMPLYING       

254
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:25,932
                     WITH SOME  
                 TECHNICALITY   
                 IN HIS TRUST.  

255
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:29,202
     AND IT WAS ALL VERY CUTE.  
     WE HAD A COUPLE OF LAUGHS. 

256
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:31,221
 AND AFTERWARDS I JABBED        
     2 PINS IN THE MAP--        

257
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,823
     WHITE PINS, I THOUGHT--    
    JUST TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL.   

258
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,326
     AND I HEAR TODAY           
     THEY'VE BEEN KILLED,       

259
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:39,596
    AND THE MAP'S HAD THEM ON   
 THE BLACKLIST ALL THE TIME.    

260
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:41,197
                 OK, SO WHAT?   

261
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:44,667
    NOTHING, IT JUST MADE ME    
        FEEL A LITTLE EERIE,    

262
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:46,235
         THAT'S ALL.            

263
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,504
I THINK HE MEANS                
HE MARKED THE                   
YOUNG COUPLE                    

264
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:51,708
FOR DEATH, SIR.                 

265
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:53,676
         YEAH, I GUESS          
         THAT WAS IT.           

266
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:56,863
     THAT MUST HAVE BEEN        
     THE FEELING I HAD.         

267
00:11:56,931 --> 00:11:58,898
     BOY, IT'S FUNNY WHAT'LL    
    GO THROUGH A GUY'S MIND,    

268
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:02,068
            ISN'T IT?           

269
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:04,170
                     DO ME A    
                 FAVOR, McKEE.  

270
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:05,505
                 IF HE STARTS   
                 FOOLING AROUND 

271

                     PINS AGAIN,

         I WAS NO SLOUCH        

546
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:02,331
        WHEN IT CAME TO PINNING

550
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:34,997
YOU BETTER CALL HENRY           
AND TELL HIM WHAT WE DID.       

551
00:25:35,064 --> 00:25:36,765
                 HE'D ONLY THINK
                WE WERE KIDDING.

            SAW FIT TO DISTURB  
             YOU, LIEUTENANT.   

631
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:53,688
         NO HARM DONE.          

632
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:55,157
         WHAT DO YOU            
        MAKE OF IT, JESS?       

633
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:57,625
                I KEEP TELLING  
                 HIM IT'S JUST  
                 COINCIDENCE.   

634
00:29:57,693 --> 00:29:59,360
             YEAH.              

635
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:00,662
         IF I WERE              
        YOU, MR. KRAFT,         

636
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:03,064
         I'D TAKE A             
        WEEK OR 2 OFF,          
         TAKE IT EASY.          

637
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:06,534
         YOU'LL FORGET          
         ALL ABOUT IT.          

638
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:07,969
         IF YOU'RE GONNA        
         USE THIS STORY,        

639
00:30:08,037 --> 00:30:10,638
     KINDLY REFRAIN FROM        
     MENTIONING MY NAME.        

640
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:12,107
                         I KNOW.

641
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:17,412
                 LIEUTENANT     
         CLAIBORNE, WITH AN     
             "E" ON THE END.    

642
00:30:17,479 --> 00:30:20,148
     [Door opens and closes]    

643
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,217
BOY...                          

644
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:24,585
DIDN'T THINK 4 DEATHS           
COULD APPEAR SO FLIMSY          

645
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:28,389
TO A POLICEMAN.                 

646
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:31,359
        YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE   
         CALLED THE POLICE.     

647
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:32,660
             CLAIBORNE'S ONE    
                 OF THE BEST.   

648
00:30:32,728 --> 00:30:34,162
                 ANY OTHER GUY  
             MIGHT HAVE LOOKED  

649
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,264
        FOR A BIG HEAVY BOOK    
            TO THROW AT YOU.    

650
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:39,334
     YEAH.                      
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.             

651
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:42,304
ON THE OTHER HAND,              
MAYBE THAT THING'S DANGEROUS.   

652
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:43,805
REALLY DANGEROUS.               

653
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:46,875
OR MAYBE THE ELEMENT            
OF DANGER IS IN A MAN.          

654
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:48,310
IN ME.                          

655
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:49,577
                     BOB.       

656
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:51,746
IS THERE SOMETHING              
DIFFERENT ABOUT ME, JESS?       

657
00:30:51,814 --> 00:30:53,414
I'M REALLY BEGINNING            
TO WONDER.                      

658
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:54,782
                 HEY, BUDDY,    

659
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:56,551
        IF THERE IS ANYTHING    
            TO THIS MAP BIT,    

660
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:59,087
             DON'T GO BLAMING IT
             ON NAMELESS FORCES.

661
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:01,356
                MAYBE SOMEBODY'S
            TRYING TO SCARE YOU.

662
00:31:01,423 --> 00:31:08,513
             COULD BE YOU GOT   
                AN ENEMY OR 2?  

663
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:10,381
                 SOMEBODY USING 
             YOUR DESK, GEORGE? 

664
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,485
OH. HE CAME                     
IN TO KEEP ME                   
COMPANY, DARLING.               

665
00:31:13,553 --> 00:31:17,355
                 THAT WAS VERY  
                 SWEET OF HIM.  

666
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:19,407
OH, DARLING,                    
YOU MUST BE DEAD TIRED.         

667
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:20,842
             I'M ALL RIGHT, ANN.

668
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,544
NO SLEEP AND THEN               
TO HAVE TO GO BACK              
OUT THERE AGAIN--               

669
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:24,079
                 I'M ALL RIGHT! 

670
00:31:24,146 --> 00:31:26,582
     THERE'S NO CRIME           
         IN NEEDING             
        A GOOD REST.            

671
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:28,149
                GEORGE, I'VE GOT
             SOME CORRESPONDENCE

672
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:29,484
                TO TAKE CARE OF.

673
00:31:29,552 --> 00:31:31,920
         I'VE ALREADY           
         TAKEN CARE             
         OF YOUR MAIL.          

674
00:31:31,988 --> 00:31:35,891
        AND I TOOK THE          
     LIBERTY OF MAKING          
     RESERVATIONS FOR YOU.      

675
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:39,761
            FLIGHT 33           
         LEAVING FOR            
         MIAMI AT 5:45.         

676
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:41,997
        MY PAL SANFORD          
        OWNS ONE OF THE         
         FINEST HOTELS          

677
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:43,198
         ON THE BEACH--         

678
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:45,867
                         GEORGE,
                 THANKS ANYWAY. 

679
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:47,235
                THERE'S NOTHING 
                 I'D RATHER DO, 

680
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:49,838
                     BUT I CAN'T
                POSSIBLY GO NOW.

681
00:31:49,906 --> 00:31:53,575
         BOB, I GAVE            
         YOU MY WORD            

682
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:55,077
        THAT IF ANYTHING        
        HAPPENED TO HENRY       

683
00:31:55,144 --> 00:31:57,145
        YOU COULD RESIGN.       

684
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:59,581
     I TALKED TO CHARLIE        
     AND BILL HONEGGER,         

685
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:02,417
 AND THEY UNDERSTAND            
     COMPLETELY.                

686
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:03,952
     IT'S ALL FIXED, SON.       

687
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,320
         THE SITUATION'S        
                 CHANGED.       

688
00:32:05,387 --> 00:32:06,622
     UNTIL THIS THING'S         
             CLEARED UP,        

689
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:08,156
                I'M NOT ABOUT   
                 TO RESIGN.     

690
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:09,124
             OH.                

691
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:10,692
                 NOW, WILL YOU  
                TELL THE OTHERS?

692
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,428
         ASK THEM TO            
     MEET ME HERE IN MY         
     OFFICE 7:30 TONIGHT.       

693
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:15,030
                         AWFULLY
                 SHORT NOTICE.  

694
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:18,967
         THE COMMITTEE          
        CAN'T JUST IGNORE       
        WHAT'S HAPPENED.        

695
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:22,570
                         I GUESS
                 YOU'RE RIGHT.  

696
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:23,438
DARLING.                        

697
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:24,539
         ANN, I'M SORRY.        

698
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,842
         I DIDN'T MEAN          
         TO SNAP AT YOU.        

699
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:30,345
NOW, WHY CAN'T                  
YOU RESIGN?                     

700
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:33,682
         WELL, BECAUSE...       

701
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,519
     POSSIBLY SOMETHING         
     REAL, UNREAL--             
     I DON'T KNOW--             

702
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:38,920
         IS WAITING             
        TO KILL ONE OF US       

703
00:32:38,988 --> 00:32:41,156
     EVERY TIME I JAB           
         A BLACK PIN            
        INTO THAT MAP.          

704
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:43,692
BOB, IF YOU'RE                  
TALKING ABOUT                   
HENRY TROWBRIDGE,               

705
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,426
THE POOR MAN DIED               
OF A HEART ATTACK.              

706
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:48,330
HEART DISEASE                   
IS THE COUNTRY'S                
NO. ONE KILLER.                 

707
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:50,599
                     MAYBE NOT  
                    IN MILFORD. 

708
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,967
OH, BOB, YOU CAN'T MEAN         
THAT THAT MAP                   

709
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:56,154
IS LITERALLY                    
KILLING PEOPLE?                 

710
00:32:56,221 --> 00:32:59,090
                     NO, ANN,   
                     MAYBE IT   
                 ISN'T THE MAP. 

711
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:00,642
                 WHAT ABOUT     
                 THE OTHER DAY? 

712
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:01,876
                    YOU SAW ME, 
                 YOU HEARD ME-- 

713
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:04,045
         "LUNCHTIME, ANNIE.     
        I WANT YOU. I NEED YOU."

714
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:06,881
BOB, I WAS                      
OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO             
BRING A LITTLE--                

715
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:10,084
A LITTLE ROMANCE                
INTO OUR VERY DULL              
AND DISMAL LIVES.               

716
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:11,453
            NO, ANN, DON'T TRY  
             TO DENY IT NOW.    

717
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:15,089
I DO DENY IT.                   

718
00:33:15,158 --> 00:33:18,026
BOB, I LOVE YOU. I'M--          

719
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:21,763
I'M NOT IN ANY SORT             
OF OCCULT THRALL TO YOU.        

720
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,731
HEY.                            

721
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,667
CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE?          

722
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,741
ALL RIGHT, THEN,                
I WAS LYING, TOO.               

723
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:36,611
DOES THAT BRING YOU BACK        
TO REALITY AGAIN?               

724
00:33:42,918 --> 00:33:46,588
BOB?                            

725
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:50,258
I THINK WE BETTER               
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF...            

726
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:52,794
