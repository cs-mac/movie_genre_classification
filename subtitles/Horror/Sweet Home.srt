1
00:04:54,761 --> 00:05:00,829
<b>SWEET HOME</b>

2
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,125
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:43,144
Hey, babe.

4
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:48,811
Tonight... well, yeah,
I don't know, I'm exhausted.

5
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:53,144
Could we make it some
other night?

6
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,677
I'm just messing with you.

7
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,376
Happy birthday!

8
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:01,743
I called you like 27 times
and you never picked up.

9
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:08,145
No... we're not going to your
place, got a surprise.

10
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,277
Simon!

11
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,378
Simon, it's your birthday.

12
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,811
Okay, okay, fine...

13
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:19,411
I'll cancel the reservation.

14
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:21,145
Okay?

15
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:23,511
Do I get to buy some paninis
and some cheap ham...

16
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,644
or does that make you feel
uncomfortable, too?

17
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:35,611
Sorry. Yes, of course,
I understand.

18
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:39,211
I'm just trying to cheer you up.

19
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:42,310
Okay, at least trick your
housemates into going...

20
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:44,044
to the movies or something.

21
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:50,445
So... sorry, my battery
is about to die.

22
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:53,477
I'll swing by for you later,
okay?

23
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,311
I love you.

24
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:56,511
Hey.

25
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:15,344
People think that rent control's
a privilege, I call it justice.

26
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:18,657
The price of rent
these days is crazy.

27
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:20,611
Tell me about it!

28
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:24,245
I've asked them time
and again to fix that.

29
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:26,584
They just ignore me.

30
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,972
It's really dangerous,
it could fall on you.

31
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:37,811
And there's no one else left
in the building?

32
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:40,544
No. No one.

33
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:43,989
A while back a couple tried
to do up the ground floor,

34
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,812
but the realtors
put a stop to it.

35
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:52,444
Said they were building an
illegal duplex.

36
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:56,444
And why was the renovation work
on the building stopped?

37
00:08:56,478 --> 00:09:01,545
They thought that way I'd leave,
but they're sorely mistaken.

38
00:09:01,578 --> 00:09:05,937
They even sent some squatters
in to make my life hell.

39
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:07,040
Who did?

40
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,822
Who do you think?
The realtors.

41
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:13,212
Haven't you been listening?
They want me out.

42
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:15,812
They want to tear
the building down.

43
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:19,513
They buy up old buildings and kick
out the old people living there.

44
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:22,985
They turn each apartment
into four or five,

45
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:25,279
then rent them for
a small fortune.

46
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:27,812
A great business!

47
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:29,446
But not me.

48
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,412
You're not going anywhere.

49
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,279
No.

50
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:34,146
Look...

51
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:35,278
Ramon.

52
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,812
Ramon. The law's on your side.

53
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:40,679
And I'm giving the building
a favorable report.

54
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:42,312
The structure's not damaged.

55
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:44,346
But to be honest, I think you
should give in.

56
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:48,479
Well, well! And I thought you
were working for them, too.

57
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:51,813
Since there are no honest people
left in this country.

58
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,512
Yeah... look I know you don't
want to hear this...

59
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:57,312
but the situation's not likely
to improve.

60
00:09:57,345 --> 00:10:00,612
This isn't much of a home anymore,
especially not out there.

61
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:02,178
I'm not leaving!

62
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:04,179
I see.

63
00:10:06,345 --> 00:10:07,780
Wait...

64
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:11,545
Could I have your card?

65
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,079
In case I think of anything else
to tell you.

66
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:16,745
Or, if something happens.

67
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,380
If anything happens, Ramon, you
should call the police.

68
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:35,179
I appreciate it.

69
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:39,645
Be sure to close the front door
properly. Please.

70
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,279
It's broken and anyone could
walk in.

71
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,312
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

72
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,447
You are scared of your own
shadow.

73
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,613
Silly, you.

74
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:58,679
Stop, stop, stop! Look
at the mess you're making.

75
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:01,146
I tried to get them to go
to the cinema...

76
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,580
but they said with this weather, I
better just download something.

77
00:12:03,612 --> 00:12:06,046
It's okay. We'll go
someplace else.

78
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,813
And don't say anything!
It hasn't cost me a cent.

79
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,579
Okay, all right.

80
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:13,279
Happy birthday.

81
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:14,413
You have to put this on.

82
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:16,179
Heh, you're joking.

83
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:18,413
No. It's my birthday surprise
and I'm totally serious.

84
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,180
Okay, all right.

85
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,714
So what, are we going?

86
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,247
Yeah, okay.

87
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:22,480
Ali, what are you doing?

88
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:24,547
Come on.

89
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,580
I'm really wet, you know?

90
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:29,647
Come on, okay, we're going.

91
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,514
-So, start walking.
-Okay.

92
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,714
Okay, good, stay here.
Give me a sec.

93
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:47,580
Now, go farther, yeah...
it's okay, it's okay.

94
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,615
Okay, I don't trust you!

95
00:13:49,648 --> 00:13:51,515
Okay, I'm with you.

96
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:55,047
Now... one step.

97
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,281
-Okay.
-One more.

98
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,448
Yes.

99
00:13:58,481 --> 00:14:00,281
And...

100
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,515
Surprise.

101
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:09,214
Ali, what's this?

102
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:13,148
Fit a bro and zero cost.
You like it?

103
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,547
Of course, yeah!

104
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,781
But where are we?

105
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:22,114
Yeah, I borrowed some keys.

106
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:24,447
Who's place is this?

107
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,049
Don't ask. Tonight it's ours,
okay? No more questions.

108
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:29,648
Okay.

109
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:31,747
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

110
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,681
Yeah?

111
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:36,814
I swapped out the paninis
for my kid Ross.

112
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:39,383
Veg one, no cost.

113
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,580
And you know the best part
of Japanese food?

114
00:14:43,614 --> 00:14:44,815
What?

115
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:47,316
It doesn't get cold.

116
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,716
Tell me what
you're thinking about.

117
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,516
Nothing.

118
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:31,616
You've been in the dumps
for days now, something's wrong.

119
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:35,149
Nothing's wrong... really.

120
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:45,015
I don't like seeing you
like this.

121
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:54,248
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm sorry.

122
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,516
It's just that...

123
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:03,083
Sometimes I think it'd be nice to
go back and do things differently.

124
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:04,648
You know?

125
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:10,415
You can't keep going
on like this.

126
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:14,381
Well, I'm trying to stay
positive, I'm telling you.

127
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:18,215
I've got too much time to think.
I need a job. I need money.

128
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:21,548
It's not too late, Simon.

129
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:25,149
I told you a thousand times, you
should try going back into medicine.

130
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:27,750
It's not all that easy.

131
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:31,249
I think you'd be happier.

132
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:35,417
Yeah, well, I've got
to face the facts, okay?

133
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,749
I am a nurse. It's not
that bad, is it?

134
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,316
No, that's not what you want.

135
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:03,316
Well, today is not the day
to talk about this.

136
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:07,182
I don't want to think about it
now. It's your birthday.

137
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:09,684
And...

138
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:19,417
Tah-dah! Happy birthday.

139
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:21,617
Fuck, honey, I told you,
no gifts.

140
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:22,999
Yeah, but...

141
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,349
I thought we had a deal.

142
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,382
You know how this makes me feel.

143
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:30,050
You already put the whole party
together, now you...

144
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,115
Shit... I am such a dick.

145
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:37,382
I'm sorry.

146
00:17:41,817 --> 00:17:43,482
-Your mother.
-Not now.

147
00:17:43,516 --> 00:17:46,250
She won't let up
until you answer.

148
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:49,282
Seriously, I'm sorry.

149
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,151
Hey, come here.

150
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:59,750
I'll go, take this
to light the way.

151
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:04,283
Ali! I'm sorry!

152
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:08,549
Imbecile.

153
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:43,316
Well, hey!
What are you doing out here?

154
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,484
Hello! Come here.

155
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:50,317
You're shaking, poor thing!

156
00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:52,683
You want to go upstairs?

157
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,484
Okay, I'll take you.

158
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:57,251
But you go in by yourself, okay?

159
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:24,185
Nice fucking job.

160
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,217
I'll go see if I can
find a dust pan.

161
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:28,419
Where did you find this genius,

162
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:31,518
I don't know, he looked smarter
to me the first time I saw him.

163
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:36,285
Hey, screw the dust pan, let's
go.

164
00:21:12,452 --> 00:21:14,184
Ramón?

165
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:41,319
Shit! It's in the car.
Fuck!

166
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:29,652
Please, Simon, don't come out!

167
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:35,487
Ali?

168
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,519
Ali?

169
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:53,553
Ali?

170
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,253
There's no one in there.

171
00:23:58,286 --> 00:24:00,053
Ali?

172
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:02,620
Hey, hey, you stay here.
Be alert.

173
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:06,020
Ali?

174
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,420
Get him!

175
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:41,520
What the hell's going on?

176
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,722
Shut up! Calm down!

177
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:29,187
You! Why the fuck are you
here? Who are you with?

178
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,621
I don't speak Spanish very well.
I don't understand.

179
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:34,088
Don't fuck with me.
Who else is here?

180
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,387
I'm by myself.

181
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:37,155
Bullshit. Who is Ali?

182
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:40,422
Ali, my cat. I was looking
for her.

183
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:44,255
Your cat, right? Cats don't
throw phones down stairs.

184
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:48,321
In beast, you be true... and where
is Ali? We don't have all night.

185
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:06,554
Where is it?

186
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:28,688
Help me! Please!

187
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:34,156
Is anyone there?

188
00:27:34,189 --> 00:27:36,323
Somebody help!

189
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:41,789
Help! We're trapped!

190
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,756
He's not getting any better.

191
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:15,390
Your cat, right?

192
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,156
Don't lie to me again.

193
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:22,589
We've got to do something.
He's out cold!

194
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:37,355
He's a doctor.
This fuck is a doctor.

195
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:40,423
Shit. Do something,
come on!

196
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:43,623
Get up, you have an emergency,
doctor.

197
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,189
Get up.

198
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:47,056
Get the fuck up!

199
00:30:27,823 --> 00:30:30,790
I think he might have some kind
of spinal cord injury.

200
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:32,590
Moving him would be very
dangerous.

201
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,823
What the fuck are you saying?

202
00:30:33,857 --> 00:30:35,591
Wait.

203
00:30:37,389 --> 00:30:38,424
Look.

204
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,190
I need this, okay?

205
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,257
See? He's got no feeling.

206
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:53,524
He needs to be mobilized and
taken to a hospital.

207
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:54,590
-What?
-The hospital.

208
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,489
No hospitals.

209
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,289
You fucking heard him! Just call
them and tell them what happened!

210
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,724
We're not calling anybody, okay?

211
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,091
They said it was only
going to be the old guy!

212
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:03,556
This shit is not
our problem now!

213
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,090
Could you use your goddamn head
for once, you fucking idiot?

214
00:31:09,124 --> 00:31:11,390
Of course, it's our problem.

215
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:13,657
If they send someone, man,
we're fucked.

216
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,556
Why would they need us if we
didn't know how to do our job?

217
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:19,223
If we don't clean this up,
we are not getting paid.

218
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:21,490
Do the job and you get paid.

219
00:31:21,523 --> 00:31:23,124
That was the deal.

220
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:24,258
Okay.

221
00:31:25,723 --> 00:31:27,392
Okay, I get it.

222
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,091
I'm gonna go see.

223
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:02,524
Keep an eye on him.

224
00:32:30,724 --> 00:32:31,792
Something wrong?

225
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,524
No.

226
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:35,458
Don't do anything stupid.

227
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:08,558
Emergency Services,
how can I help?

228
00:33:08,591 --> 00:33:10,691
I... there are...

229
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:12,524
Me and my girlfriend, we're
locked inside a buil...

230
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:13,425
there are three men here.

231
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,725
They're trying to kill us.
You've gotta send someone.

232
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:18,292
<i>Calm down, sir. I can't
understand you.</i>

233
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:20,525
<i>Tell me, what is your location?</i>

234
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:23,092
What?

235
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:26,459
<i>I need you to tell me exactly
where you are. Sir?</i>

236
00:33:26,491 --> 00:33:28,792
I don't know.

237
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:31,591
<i>I can't help you if I don't
know exactly where you are.</i>

238
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:33,492
<i>Sir?</i>

239
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:50,825
Fuck!

240
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:20,492
Thanks for taking care
of my brother.

241
00:34:22,691 --> 00:34:24,692
Fuck! No!

242
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,725
No! No!

243
00:35:09,624 --> 00:35:11,292
Are you okay?

244
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:12,626
Yeah, are you?

245
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,393
No, I'm not, I...
Who the fuck are these guys?

246
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:21,292
I think... I think they are
from the real estate agency.

247
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:22,460
They killed the old man.

248
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:24,492
The real estate agency,
what the fuck?

249
00:35:24,526 --> 00:35:25,660
We need to get out of here!

250
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,526
No, wait!

251
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,225
The front door is stuck and all
the windows are bricked up.

252
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:31,393
We can't get out of here.

253
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:32,493
Shit.

254
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:37,727
-Fuck! He's coming!
-What?

255
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,326
Come on! Come on!

256
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,160
What about the other guy?

257
00:35:41,192 --> 00:35:42,492
He's dead!

258
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:43,626
Come on.

259
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:50,727
-What are you doing?
-We got the keys.

260
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,126
Hurry up!

261
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:56,627
Go, go, go, go! Come on!

262
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:02,427
Shit! Come on! He's coming!

263
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:05,793
Close the door! Close the door!
Close the door!

264
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:08,092
Open the fucking door!

265
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,127
What are you doing?

266
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:14,761
Agh! Agh!

267
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:26,793
Somebody!

268
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:37,094
Fuck! Holy fucking shit!

269
00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:40,194
I'm going to fucking kill her!

270
00:36:40,227 --> 00:36:42,294
Alicia, you bitch!

271
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:16,760
Calm down.

272
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:23,428
Hello? I know, I know.
I'm sorry for calling.

273
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:27,227
We've got a problem.

274
00:37:27,259 --> 00:37:30,461
There were other people
in the building.

275
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:32,660
I don't know.

276
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:35,627
As well as the old man,
there was a couple.

277
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:39,260
No idea!
They must have snuck in.

278
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:42,326
Yeah, if you could send someone
I'd really appreciate it.

279
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,461
Of course, I'll wait here.

280
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:48,127
Got it. Thanks so much
and I'm really sorry.

281
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,694
Okay. Bye.

282
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:59,760
Let me take a look, okay?

283
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:01,126
Fuck!

284
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,661
Thanks for not pretending.

285
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:04,594
Yeah, you're losing
a lot of blood.

286
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:07,128
We need a 24-hour pharmacy.

287
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,393
Don't piss a little, okay.

288
00:38:09,426 --> 00:38:11,627
Shit.

289
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:13,261
I'm sorry about before.

290
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,293
How about you two come out
and we finish this?

291
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:17,528
What are you doing?

292
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,828
Leave us alone! Fuck!

293
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:24,561
What about the old man's flat? His
windows wouldn't be boarded, right?

294
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,162
Yeah, and how would we
get there?

295
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:27,428
What's going on in there?

296
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,029
Cut us some slack, okay?

297
00:38:34,593 --> 00:38:37,028
Hey! What the fuck
is going on in there?

298
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:47,461
Simon... the duplex.

299
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,760
What?

300
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,396
We're in the upper part.

301
00:39:06,361 --> 00:39:08,228
What are you gonna do?

302
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:10,727
For now, get the blueprints out
of my purse, I'll be right back.

303
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,761
There's gotta be a way.

304
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:26,177
What about the basement?

305
00:39:26,178 --> 00:39:27,561
Yeah, I thought about it.

306
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:29,495
We could get out to the
street through there,

307
00:39:29,496 --> 00:39:30,762
but I don't have the
keys to that door.

308
00:39:30,795 --> 00:39:34,128
Shit, this is a fucking
mousetrap.

309
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:35,428
What... what about the roof?

310
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:38,262
I checked it out and it's
bricked off.

311
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,638
We could get out downstairs,

312
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:42,327
and try reaching the old man's
apartment and call for help.

313
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:45,329
And how do we get up to the third
floor without this guy seeing us?

314
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,144
By climbing the freight lift.

315
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:51,729
I don't know I'll be fit
for a hike.

316
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:54,062
Yeah, I know. You stay here.
I'll go faster alone, okay?

317
00:39:54,096 --> 00:39:55,429
You can distract him.

318
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:56,695
I... I don't think this
is a good idea.

319
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,662
Yeah, me, neither.

320
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:01,561
Just make all the noise you can and
keep his mind off the lift, okay?

321
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:03,694
I don't know.

322
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:05,561
Trust me.

323
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:10,062
Be careful.

324
00:40:55,795 --> 00:40:57,762
Let us out!

325
00:40:57,795 --> 00:41:01,296
I already told you to come out.
I'm waiting here.

326
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:02,695
Motherfucker!

327
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:50,829
Stop with the fucking banging!

328
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:52,730
-Hold on!
-Fucking idiot, man.

329
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:55,063
Do you know how to say
that in Spanish?

330
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,296
Screw you!
Go fuck yourself!

331
00:42:28,396 --> 00:42:32,130
Hey! Hey!

332
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:54,698
Hey! Fucking look up here!

333
00:45:57,531 --> 00:46:02,066
Hey! Hey!

334
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:08,066
Up here! Fuck! Up here!
For fuck's sake!

335
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,631
Here! Fucking look up here!

336
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:17,399
Fuck!

337
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:39,466
Come on, Simon. Give me that!
Come on?

338
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:42,032
You're a tough guy?

339
00:46:44,264 --> 00:46:46,298
You look like me, Simon?

340
00:46:56,532 --> 00:46:58,466
Come on!

341
00:47:07,398 --> 00:47:09,033
What the fuck?

342
00:47:12,565 --> 00:47:14,565
Where do you think
you're going?

343
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,465
Hey! You're trapped!

344
00:47:16,498 --> 00:47:20,833
Agh! You're trapped! Where do
you think you're going?

345
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:24,233
Fucking bitch! Agh!

346
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:06,433
How'd it go?

347
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,534
Badly.

348
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:08,665
What happened?

349
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:10,765
Shut up, he'll hear us.

350
00:48:10,799 --> 00:48:12,500
Who can hear us?

351
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:14,133
The back-up.

352
00:48:33,232 --> 00:48:34,266
Who's that?

353
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,332
The old man from upstairs.

354
00:48:36,366 --> 00:48:38,667
How did he get down here?

355
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,600
Don't ask.

356
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:01,801
Hey! I'm up here!

357
00:49:01,834 --> 00:49:05,467
Someone come and help me!
I'm trapped!

358
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:17,666
Who the fuck is this guy?

359
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,434
I don't know.
Let's go upstairs.

360
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:25,467
It's about time! I've been stuck
here for half an hour!

361
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:28,167
One of them's inside.

362
00:49:28,201 --> 00:49:30,101
I don't know where
the girl went.

363
00:49:38,766 --> 00:49:40,567
Will you get a move on?

364
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:42,634
Unbelievable.

365
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,101
What are you doing, man?

366
00:49:52,134 --> 00:49:53,234
Hey! No!

367
00:50:14,866 --> 00:50:16,735
What's he doing?

368
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:20,635
Run! Down the stairs! Run!

369
00:50:53,334 --> 00:50:55,201
How are we gonna get out
of here?

370
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:42,634
Shit!

371
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,068
What's going on?

372
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,734
He found the keys
to the basement.

373
00:52:23,534 --> 00:52:25,301
The lift, it's got electricity.

374
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:27,502
What?

375
00:52:27,534 --> 00:52:29,802
If there's electricity, maybe the
emergency intercom's working.

376
00:52:29,835 --> 00:52:32,401
We could use it to call
for help.

377
00:52:32,435 --> 00:52:34,436
We'll be in the middle
of the building.

378
00:52:34,469 --> 00:52:36,603
He'll hear us, he'll see us.

379
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:41,368
What about trying to steal the
guys to the basement off him?

380
00:52:41,402 --> 00:52:43,702
Yeah, he won't see us that way.

381
00:52:43,734 --> 00:52:45,568
I can't climb up there.

382
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:47,335
Yes, you can.

383
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:48,736
No, I can't.

384
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:51,535
Simon, doing nothing
is not an option.

385
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,101
Just sitting here,
I'm telling you,

386
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:55,401
it's only a matter of
time before he finds us.

387
00:52:55,434 --> 00:52:57,756
We'll climb up the
shaft, call for help,

388
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,135
and lock ourselves
in on the third floor.

389
00:53:00,169 --> 00:53:02,602
That why we'll buy some time
before they come help us.

390
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:08,469
What if the intercom
isn't working?

391
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:33,136
Hey.

392
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,369
How about this?

393
00:53:43,802 --> 00:53:45,537
Let me help you.

394
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:50,803
Was there no other color?

395
00:54:30,102 --> 00:54:31,324
If I don't get to
a hospital soon,

396
00:54:31,325 --> 00:54:33,770
I don't think there are
gonna be many more birthdays.

397
00:54:35,635 --> 00:54:38,502
We're getting out of here...
I promise you.

398
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:17,138
When he starts to knock
the door down, we go, okay?

399
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,771
Hey... sorry.

400
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:33,136
For what?

401
00:55:33,169 --> 00:55:35,037
For this crappy birthday.

402
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:40,171
I'm sorry I was such a dick.

403
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:41,538
Thank you for my present.

404
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,638
Yeah, it's pretty useful, right?

405
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:49,104
I love you.

406
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,771
Me, too.

407
00:56:03,237 --> 00:56:04,404
Let's go.

408
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:30,405
Shit!

409
00:57:30,437 --> 00:57:31,371
What?

410
00:57:31,405 --> 00:57:33,171
It's not working.

411
00:57:33,204 --> 00:57:34,771
Let's go, Ali.

412
00:57:34,803 --> 00:57:36,205
No, wait.

413
00:57:40,304 --> 00:57:42,505
He's gonna find the hatch.

414
00:57:42,537 --> 00:57:44,238
Let's get inside.
We've still got time.

415
00:57:44,271 --> 00:57:46,171
It's gotta be a loose wire
or something.

416
00:57:46,204 --> 00:57:47,371
It's not gonna work, Ali,
come on!

417
00:57:47,404 --> 00:57:49,371
-Wait!
-Quit shouting.

418
00:57:49,405 --> 00:57:52,239
I'm not shouting. If this
doesn't work, we'll go, okay?

419
00:58:02,572 --> 00:58:04,439
Okay.

420
00:58:23,705 --> 00:58:25,138
Run!

421
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:46,172
Run, Simon! Hurry up!

422
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:55,373
Come on, Simon, come on.
Come on.

423
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:58,073
Simon, come on! Simon!

424
00:58:58,105 --> 00:58:59,471
Simon, what are you doing?
Come on!

425
00:58:59,504 --> 00:59:01,338
I can't move.
I'm not gonna make it.

426
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:02,638
-Leave! Go!
-No!

427
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:04,239
I won't leave without you!

428
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:07,539
Come on!

429
00:59:09,506 --> 00:59:13,105
I'm sorry, honey. I can't.
You have to go.

430
00:59:22,205 --> 00:59:23,639
I love you.

431
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:24,806
Please go.

432
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:26,507
I love you.

433
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:52,272
No!

434
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:56,474
Please don't hurt her.

435
01:00:56,507 --> 01:00:58,374
Please...

436
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,407
I need help!

437
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:36,474
Simon!

438
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:22,441
My god.

439
01:04:26,741 --> 01:04:29,675
We're leaving, Simon.
We're leaving.

440
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:30,775
Look.

441
01:04:30,776 --> 01:04:31,841
What happened?

442
01:06:58,776 --> 01:07:00,709
Shit!

443
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:06,044
This is disgusting!

444
01:15:27,248 --> 01:15:28,382
Fuck!

445
01:15:55,148 --> 01:15:56,583
Go to hell!

446
01:15:56,616 --> 01:15:58,685
Son of a bitch! Mother fucker!
