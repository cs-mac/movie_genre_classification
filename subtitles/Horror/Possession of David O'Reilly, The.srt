1
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:40,529
THE POSSESSION

2
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:47,232
The following is
based on a true story.

3
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,488
This is what happened to one
family over the course of 29 days.

4
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,350
Mom?

5
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,628
Come on, guys, push it!

6
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:46,962
Move when you got the ball!
Nobody's moving there.

7
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:49,966
Know where your teammates are!

8
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:52,932
All right, hold up. Hold it up.

9
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:57,029
New ball.
We are going to play with this ball.

10
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,141
Invisiball.

11
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,768
It's funny. You think it's silly.

12
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,797
Practice is the place
it's okay to feel silly.

13
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:07,986
The practice floor.

14
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:10,517
Not with people watching you play.

15
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:12,736
Alright, you guys.
Run a couple plays.

16
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:13,842
Set it up. Three game.

17
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:15,350
Where's the ball?

18
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:17,644
- In my mind, coach.
- It is in your mind.

19
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:21,148
One brain! There you go!
That's the way to move it!

20
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,814
You play better with the
invisiball than the real ball.

21
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:34,174
-Hey, kiddo.
-Hey, how are you?

22
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,182
Good, how are you?

23
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:38,881
You spaz.
Yeah, I was there all alone.

24
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:39,895
-Hi.
-Hey.

25
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,260
You're late.

26
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:45,476
Practice ran long.

27
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,232
Oh, uh, Clyde, shoes, please?

28
00:04:57,892 --> 00:04:59,521
What is this?

29
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:02,604
I needed work space for the business.
We're up and running.

30
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:04,542
Hmm.

31
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:06,879
Yeah.

32
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,894
The jewelry design. I told
you I was getting back into it.

33
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:17,010
Stephanie, I had a bunch of stuff in here.

34
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:19,838
I boxed up your stuff.
Your name's on it.

35
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,775
Everything's in the closet.

36
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:26,256
Don't you think I should
have packed up my office?

37
00:05:26,257 --> 00:05:28,354
It's not your office anymore.

38
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,582
Hey, kiddo. You ready to go?

39
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:47,891
Which one you think is a better slogan?

40
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:50,114
"Stop The Killing, Eat Vegetables...

41
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:52,168
...or When You Eat Animals,
You Become One?

42
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,897
First of all, that is awesome...

43
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:59,300
...but Stop The Killing
is super catchy.

44
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:01,923
-Get my message?
-Loud and clear.

45
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:05,266
Miss Shandy said that if we get
200 signatures on our petition...

46
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,644
...she will
take it to the principal...

47
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:09,457
...and they'll consider
meat-free Mondays.

48
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,981
Wow, that will make you so popular.

49
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:15,921
Dad, were all one big
family on this planet...

50
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:17,051
...no matter what species...

51
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:19,178
...and we don't eat family, do we?

52
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,791
No, we certainly do not.

53
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,420
-Hi, Clyde.
-Hey.

54
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:28,080
Careful. You are entering
a shoe-free zone.

55
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,652
I know. I got that
sign for Stephanie.

56
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:33,887
You wouldn't believe
what's dragged indoors.

57
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:34,849
I'm sure I wouldn't.

58
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,891
-Hey!
-Hi.

59
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:38,426
What are you up to tonight?

60
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:40,962
-Going to a concert.
-Nice.

61
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:42,946
Season tickets. Wagner.

62
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:47,144
Wagner? Stephanie loves Wagner,
don't you, dear?

63
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:49,940
I'll have them back Sunday after lunch.

64
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,798
Okay.

65
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:57,017
Em's still vegetarian, so keep an eye
on her, and her allergies, please.

66
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:58,577
Last time she got hives.

67
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:01,660
And healthy food,
stuff that grows on trees.

68
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,185
No pizza, please. I mean it.

69
00:07:04,186 --> 00:07:04,957
You done?

70
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,335
Yes.

71
00:07:06,336 --> 00:07:08,438
-Stephanie...
-Yes?

72
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,404
I think I got this.

73
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:11,657
-Okay.
-Okay.

74
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,553
-Bye, you guys! I love you!
-Bye!

75
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:25,002
-Brett says I have an overbite.
-Give me a break, your teeth are fine.

76
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:28,521
Brett's job is to tell
people they have bad teeth.

77
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:29,581
That's how he makes money.

78
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,043
He said he'd fix it for free.

79
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:34,263
Uh, Dad?

80
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:35,801
Yeah?

81
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:38,109
You passed your apartment.

82
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,172
Oh, I did, didn't I?

83
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:41,337
Ta-dah!

84
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:42,492
What is it?

85
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:45,045
What is it? This is our new house.

86
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:47,633
-It's in the middle of nowhere.
-Isn't it awesome?

87
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,911
And critters come by from the woods.

88
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:52,363
Yesterday, two raccoons on our porch.

89
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:53,172
Really?

90
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,615
Come on, Mopey McGee.

91
00:07:56,568 --> 00:08:00,922
Wow, this is pretty cool.

92
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:03,336
Right? Bedrooms are upstairs.

93
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,613
I call the room facing the woods!

94
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:15,798
You got it. That's your room.

95
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,800
Dad, there's a doggie door!

96
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:22,059
Lets get a dog from
the shelter. Please.

97
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,918
Please, please, please, please.

98
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:27,720
You've got to be kidding me.
This does not work on me anymore.

99
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:30,472
Daddy, yes, it does. Please.

100
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:34,555
Cheers.

101
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,653
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

102
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:41,455
I think Mom would
really like this house.

103
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:42,874
We should invite her for breakfast.

104
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:47,737
Mom and Dad officially
divorced three months ago.

105
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:49,596
Mom's not coming for pancakes.

106
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,618
-That's enough.
-Its getting old.

107
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:54,394
She thinks you're
getting back together.

108
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:59,571
Em, your mom and I,
we just sort of, uh...

109
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,463
...we forgot how to get along.

110
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:05,684
And you both are moving on with your lives.

111
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:09,137
I know. That's what Mom always says.

112
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,888
Your mom says that?

113
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:18,195
Okay. Then, there you have it.
You know, its for the best.

114
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:22,786
Okay? So let's have our dinner.

115
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:24,878
I'm not hungry anymore.

116
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:28,130
Alright, clear your plate.

117
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,265
Hannah...

118
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:40,508
You can't say that. It upsets your sister.

119
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:45,775
For real?
You're going to blame this on me?

120
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:48,369
Nice, Dad.

121
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:56,657
"Walk a little faster,"
said the whiting to the snail.

122
00:09:56,658 --> 00:10:01,004
"There's a porpoise close behind us,
and he's treading on my tail."

123
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:02,543
How was your day today?

124
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:05,384
Okay. How was yours?

125
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,816
Dinner was a failure.

126
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:09,848
Make sure Mom doesn't
find out about dinner.

127
00:10:09,849 --> 00:10:12,771
She'll be mad pizza
doesn't grow on trees.

128
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:15,202
I'll give you $5 if
you don't tell your momther.

129
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:18,235
Make it 35 and we have a deal.

130
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,292
Go to sleep.

131
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,841
Leave the door open.

132
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:28,132
What's the matter? You scared?

133
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,937
No. Just... I want it open, okay?

134
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,828
Dad, you need dishes.

135
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:47,635
Okay.

136
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:50,241
<i>Hey, Clyde, its Trevor down at NC.</i>

137
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:52,890
<i>Call me. I want to talk to you.</i>

138
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:54,039
<i>Hope you're good, pal.</i>

139
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,377
Dad, look! I'm a lady.

140
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:21,836
Cool.

141
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:39,848
-Daddy, can I get this?
-That is a lovely hat.

142
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,028
Whatever you want, kiddo.

143
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:44,934
So we found a couple things.
What's the damage?

144
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:49,339
-How about 55?
-55.

145
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:55,238
My daughters cleaned me out.
I have $48.

146
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,815
-We'll put something back.
-Oh, no.

147
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,814
-You sure?
-Yeah.

148
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:00,359
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

149
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:05,017
You're clearing out.
You moving or something?

150
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:08,642
-No. Some of bills came up.
-Oh.

151
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:48,036
No! No!

152
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:03,671
Look at these carvings.
They're so pretty.

153
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,586
These directions are ridiculous.

154
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,378
Em, do me a favor and hand
me the screwdriver, please?

155
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:14,854
But Daddy,
you said you'd get this open.

156
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,595
Well, that's weird.
There aren't any seams.

157
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:21,910
What does that mean?

158
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:26,361
It means whoever made this
didn't want anybody to open it...

159
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:29,359
...or they didn't want
anybody to open it easily.

160
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,662
You hear that?
There's something in there.

161
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:39,351
So somebody had to open it,
once upon a time.

162
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:41,619
That is absolutely correct.

163
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:46,815
-Daddy, no.
-I have to take it.

164
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:49,734
-Trevor. Sorry, I missed your calls.
-Daddy.

165
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:50,630
<i>How's my old friend doing?</i>

166
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:51,591
Good.

167
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:52,318
Daddy--

168
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:54,230
<i>You run a good program up there.</i>

169
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,307
<i>You have two conference titles.</i>

170
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:58,194
You calling just to chat?

171
00:13:58,195 --> 00:14:00,017
<i>Our board is taking note.</i>

172
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:04,158
<i>Thought it was time you come to
North Carolina, discuss your future.</i>

173
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,085
What are we talking about here?

174
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:09,406
<i>Talking about you moving
up to Division One.</i>

175
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,962
Does Coach Hill know you doing this?

176
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:12,128
<i>He's retiring.</i>

177
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:14,443
<i>He told me to contact you.</i>

178
00:14:14,444 --> 00:14:18,375
<i>Said the school needs one
of their own to come take the reins.</i>

179
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:22,205
What can I say?
Hell, yes, I'm interested.

180
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,032
-What's going on?
-I don't know. It wasn't me.

181
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:44,049
-Dad!
-Hannah! What is it?

182
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,468
It was on my face! Get it off!

183
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:48,061
-What are you talking about?
-It's under the covers!

184
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:55,082
Dad!

185
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,273
-You did that on my bed.
-You told me to kill it.

186
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:00,240
I told you to get it out.

187
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,206
God, Dad.

188
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:06,294
She told me to kill it.

189
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,552
It's a moth!

190
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:23,508
Make some noise for the
most dazzling divas of dance...

191
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,798
...who always bring it fierce...

192
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,611
...the Silverstars!

193
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:29,573
Make me a home,
on my own, betta make that bedrock

194
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,338
Hey, are you okay?

195
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,495
-I feel funny.
-What?

196
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:44,363
-I feel funny.
-What do you mean?

197
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,871
I don't feel like me.

198
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:51,736
I know this stuff
with Mom and Dad sucks...

199
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,575
...but we're just the kids,
and they're the adults...

200
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:58,716
...and we have to go
along with their mistakes.

201
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:02,757
But you'll feel better if
you just stopped giving a shit.

202
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:19,616
Hi! Hey! Oh...

203
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:20,868
Oh, hi, Mommy.

204
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,834
-I missed you guys.
-I missed you too.

205
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,008
How was the weekend?

206
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,826
It was good. We had pizza.

207
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:30,178
Wow, yes,
the new house has a pizza tree.

208
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,854
-Is Jen's mom coming?
-Oh, yeah.

209
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:35,053
Your outfit is on your bed...

210
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:37,660
...and take one of your
allergy pills just in case.

211
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:40,594
If one of your players had food allergies...

212
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:44,358
...you'd write the cafeteria
ladies with menu demands.

213
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,454
Cut me some slack.

214
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:50,214
I was going get the boxes.

215
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:52,450
-Okay.
-Okay.

216
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,441
What's with this guy?
Is he moving in or what?

217
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:05,040
No. No, we're just dating.

218
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,168
You're just dating?

219
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:09,474
He's awfully comfortable
in the kitchen.

220
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:10,815
Back off, Clyde.

221
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:14,496
-In his antiseptic socks.
-At least he's present.

222
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:15,798
Excuse me?

223
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,400
Presence, attendance...

224
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:19,308
...being in the moment
as opposed to absent.

225
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:21,568
-Like you.
-I know what it means.

226
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,961
-Don't forget your stuff.
-Fine.

227
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:02,118
Hello?

228
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,163
<i>Clyde, it's Trevor.</i>

229
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:04,799
Hey.

230
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,886
<i>Got your flight lined up.</i>

231
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:09,358
<i>I'll have the university
pick you up when you land.</i>

232
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,204
<i>-Quite the welcome.
-You'll love it.</i>

233
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:14,190
<i>Okay. Thank you for calling.</i>

234
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:15,629
<i>Keep me informed. Alright, bye.</i>

235
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,165
So she's in the middle row.

236
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,334
-Hannah's dance is next week.
-Oh!

237
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:22,723
It's her first time with a real audience.

238
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,848
-That's cool.
-Are you gonna make it?

239
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,412
Heck, yes, I'm coming.

240
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:29,175
Mom will be there,
so don't feel obligated.

241
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:32,085
Are you kidding?
I'll be in the front row.

242
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,817
What's in your mouth?

243
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:36,777
Hannah, I told you,
your teeth were perfect.

244
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:41,626
No, you said it was my decision,
and I don't want to be disfigured.

245
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:44,234
Disfigured?
Who said you were disfigured?

246
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,934
I did. I'm totally disfigured.

247
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:48,912
You are perfect.

248
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:04,725
Dad?

249
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:05,774
What? What's wrong?

250
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:08,173
Go back outside.

251
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:09,879
-Is someone in the house?
-Go

252
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,799
Who's there?

253
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:46,326
Dad?

254
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:51,025
It's okay, you guys.
I think we have a raccoon.

255
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:03,649
Emily.

256
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,377
Emily.

257
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:17,151
Emily.

258
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:26,418
Emily.

259
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:38,221
Em, breakfast is ready!

260
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:43,393
Ace!

261
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:48,573
Can't you hear me yelling for you?
Breakfast is ready.

262
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,145
Em.

263
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:04,644
What's wrong, Daddy?

264
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:10,612
First, the announcer comes out and
announces us.

265
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:14,430
He has the most obnoxious voice.
I don't know why I can't do it.

266
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,711
And he goes like, "Make some noise...

267
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:21,499
"...for the most dazzling divas of
dance, who always keep it fierce...

268
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,710
...the Silverstars!"

269
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:26,033
We all wear a ponytail
to look the same...

270
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,228
...because we're the
chorus with the can-can.

271
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:32,585
-Jen cut her hair. She needs extensions.
-Em, slow down.

272
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:34,950
They use real Indian and Asian hair.

273
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:38,892
-I personally think it's gross.
-Em--

274
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:41,765
They sweep it into
bins and weigh it...

275
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:45,073
...then they take it to
a place where they make wigs...

276
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,761
Em, slow down!

277
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,628
I'm sorry, Daddy! I'm sorry, Daddy!

278
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:54,019
-I'm really sorry!
-Go to your room.

279
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,002
Hannah, what happened?

280
00:25:20,002 --> 00:25:21,306
In there!

281
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:23,710
Oh, my god.

282
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,825
My god.

283
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,521
Em? Stay there, Em.

284
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,408
Close the door. Close it!

285
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:26,012
Hey, are you okay?

286
00:26:26,013 --> 00:26:28,041
What happened?

287
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,213
Creepy.

288
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:39,279
I had no idea moths were
attracted to pizza and soda.

289
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,112
The pest control
guy can take care of it.

290
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:45,051
I'm still getting your email on my computer.

291
00:26:45,052 --> 00:26:49,224
-Want me to take care of it?
-Yes, please.

292
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:59,822
-How was Wagner?
-It was good. Interesting.

293
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:02,556
"Interesting."

294
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:06,081
"Interesting" is code
for you fell asleep.

295
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,210
-No, I didn't.
-You totally felt asleep.

296
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,805
I didn't fall asleep.

297
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:14,043
Okay, I don't know what this file is.

298
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:17,103
What am I doing?

299
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,317
Don't you remember that?

300
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:22,378
That was the weekend the
kids were in camp, remember?

301
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,025
<i>-Good morning.
-Good morning.</i>

302
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:27,676
<i>-Did you sleep okay?
-I did. It's a little hot in here.</i>

303
00:27:27,677 --> 00:27:30,560
Oh, I do remember.

304
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:33,040
<i>No.</i>

305
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,157
<i>What are you doing?</i>

306
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:38,521
That was a weekend.

307
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:40,403
That was a weekend.

308
00:27:40,404 --> 00:27:42,642
Oh, Lord.

309
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:48,038
-Nice legs, I'll give you that.
-Oh, God.

310
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:53,294
Remember when--

311
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:55,999
-What?
-Nothing. Never mind.

312
00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:01,204
Okay.

313
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,604
All right, there you go.

314
00:28:03,604 --> 00:28:07,058
I am successfully deleted from your computer.

315
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:09,362
Thank you.

316
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:15,083
I've been meaning to ask you.

317
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:19,596
Have you noticed anything
odd going on with Emily?

318
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,195
Like what?

319
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:22,544
I don't know.

320
00:28:22,545 --> 00:28:25,888
She has these moments
where she just checks out.

321
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:30,204
We've disrupted their whole lives.

322
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:34,081
It will be a while before
anything's normal again, right?

323
00:28:37,502 --> 00:28:39,151
Yeah.

324
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:47,990
-Okay. I'll see you soon.
-Okay.

325
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,233
Thank you.

326
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:59,654
<i>Where's the communication?
I don't hear anything out here.</i>

327
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:01,501
<i>You going to pass it?</i>

328
00:29:03,171 --> 00:29:05,097
<i>No, you'll shoot it.</i>

329
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:06,889
20 minutes on the clock.

330
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,329
We're running a full half.

331
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,556
Hustle or we're staying
and running lines.

332
00:29:12,557 --> 00:29:13,898
Let's go.
Let's move.

333
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:16,143
Didn't you have to go at 5:00?

334
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:17,699
-What time is it?
-Past that.

335
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:24,767
Make some noise for the
most dazzling divas of dance...

336
00:29:24,768 --> 00:29:27,787
...who always bring it fierce--

337
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:30,943
The Silver Stars!

338
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:48,362
<i>Hannah, I'm so sorry
I missed your performance.</i>

339
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:53,631
I screwed up. I promise,
I'm going to make it up to you.

340
00:29:53,632 --> 00:29:55,623
<i>She's mad at you.</i>

341
00:29:57,715 --> 00:29:59,433
Yeah, I know.

342
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:01,143
Is my box all right?

343
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:04,432
It's fine.

344
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:06,018
<i>I don't want you going near it.</i>

345
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:09,622
Okay.

346
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,877
<i>Because I am the only one
who can touch it.</i>

347
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:18,480
Em, what's the deal with the box?

348
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:20,757
<i>Just don't touch it, okay?</i>

349
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,765
Okay. I won't.

350
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,425
<i>-Goodnight, Daddy.
-Goodnight, babygirl.</i>

351
00:30:58,085 --> 00:30:59,534
What the hell is this?

352
00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:21,587
What's in this?

353
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:24,368
Give it back!

354
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,647
Give it back to me!
Give it back to me!

355
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:31,979
Give it back to me!

356
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:33,696
No!

357
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:45,911
Emily has displayed some
unusual behavior the past few weeks.

358
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:47,806
She is becoming distant
from her friends...

359
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:51,249
...not doing her assignments.

360
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:56,322
She has lost interest in things
that were once so important to her.

361
00:33:56,323 --> 00:33:58,456
Em's been going through a lot lately.

362
00:33:58,457 --> 00:34:02,568
-You moved recently.
-Yeah, I moved.

363
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:05,659
Stephanie has the girls at...

364
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,406
...the same house they
grew up in most of the time.

365
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:09,109
How's your new home?

366
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:13,161
Things are fine.
Fine, given the circumstances.

367
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:15,151
Circumstances?

368
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:19,422
We're divorced. That's always
tough on the kids, isn't it?

369
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:24,289
I think it would benefit Emily to
talk to someone about her feelings.

370
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,751
Feelings?

371
00:34:26,905 --> 00:34:32,100
I talk to her about her feelings
all the time. About everything.

372
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:35,306
Still, she seems
extremely frustrated.

373
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:38,439
She scared everybody with that box.

374
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,310
A little time away from it will do her good.

375
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:44,756
That just doesn't
sound like Emily at all.

376
00:34:44,757 --> 00:34:46,725
She's never been in a fight. Ever!

377
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:48,630
This wasn't just a fight.

378
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:50,966
This was violent.

379
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:56,076
We've been separated
for a year with no problems.

380
00:34:56,077 --> 00:34:58,651
This behavior,
something else is going on here.

381
00:34:58,652 --> 00:35:00,157
Yeah, maybe she's insecure.

382
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,213
Maybe she's afraid you won't be there for.

383
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:07,736
Still getting your email. It's your
flight details to North Carolina.

384
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:11,399
-I was going to tell you.
-When? After you took the job?

385
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,076
Its just to sit down and talk.

386
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:16,333
If they offer it,
you going to take it?

387
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:20,339
-Of course you are.
-Wait.

388
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,950
Anything to be a big shot again.

389
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:24,754
While your daughter falls apart.

390
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,615
That has nothing to do with this.

391
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:30,327
Stay oblivious. It seems to
be working well for you.

392
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,308
Oh, come on.

393
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,005
You have to be kidding me.

394
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:41,308
Hey! Stay away from my kid's teeth.

395
00:35:55,848 --> 00:36:02,066
Subtitled by Freaky!

396
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:37,853
So, Em, do you understand
why school was cancelled today?

397
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:41,040
Because Miss Shandy's dead.

398
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:45,789
That's right. She was in
a horrible accident last night.

399
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,527
Can you get my box for me?
It's still in the classroom.

400
00:37:56,693 --> 00:38:01,175
Let's talk about
this for a second, okay?

401
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,732
Why is the box so important to you?

402
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:09,391
Don't know. Just is.

403
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:12,513
Okay.

404
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:16,737
You know, Emily...

405
00:38:16,738 --> 00:38:22,503
...I noticed sometimes
you talk to it.

406
00:38:22,504 --> 00:38:24,125
I do not talk to the box.

407
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,844
I talk to my friend.

408
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:29,993
-Your friend?
-What?

409
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:32,699
-You said you talk to your friend.
-Mm-hmm.

410
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,627
The one who lives in the box.

411
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:37,673
Your friend lives inside the box?

412
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:40,054
-What?
-He lives in there?

413
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:44,801
It's a she. A woman.

414
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:51,246
What exactly does she say to you, Emily?

415
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,490
That I'm special.

416
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:59,198
Well, you know, you are very special.

417
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,980
I'd sure like to meet her.

418
00:39:01,981 --> 00:39:05,904
Not possible. No one can see her.

419
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:07,968
Not even me.

420
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:15,282
Can I have some more?

421
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:17,875
She's still hungry.

422
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:03,953
Where's my box?

423
00:40:03,954 --> 00:40:05,567
I got rid of it, Em.

424
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:10,314
Tell me where it is.

425
00:40:10,315 --> 00:40:12,099
It's not here.

426
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:16,076
Then go get it.

427
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:17,981
We're done with the box, Emily.

428
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:23,278
-I'm calling Mom.
-And tell her what?

429
00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:25,833
-To pick me up.
-That's not happening.

430
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:28,839
And if you keep talking to me like this,
you're grounded for the rest of the weekend.

431
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:34,818
I hate you.

432
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:36,663
Go to your room. That's it.

433
00:40:36,664 --> 00:40:38,803
- Go to your room.
- I don't love you.

434
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:42,533
-Emily...
-And Mommy doesn't love you.

435
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:46,603
-You think you know everything,
but you don't. -Emily, knock it off.

436
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:47,894
Stop it right now.

437
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:49,503
Mommy loves Brett now.

438
00:40:49,504 --> 00:40:51,290
He makes her happy.

439
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:57,192
He does nice things for her!
Something you never did.

440
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,710
Ow! Daddy!
What are you doing to me. Daddy?

441
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,601
What are you...? Emily!

442
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:11,718
What are you doing to me, Daddy?

443
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,111
-What are you doing, Dad?
-I'm not doing anything!

444
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:16,971
-Did you hit her?
-No, I didn't hit her!

445
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:18,773
Emily!

446
00:41:25,923 --> 00:41:27,455
Emily!

447
00:41:45,275 --> 00:41:47,101
Em!

448
00:41:47,102 --> 00:41:48,916
Em!

449
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:51,273
Em!

450
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,298
Are you my friend from the box?

451
00:42:59,604 --> 00:43:03,862
No. No.

452
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:12,722
Because my dad doesn't...
my dad doesn't like me anymore.

453
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,618
No.

454
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:19,731
What are you talking about?

455
00:43:22,714 --> 00:43:23,993
No!

456
00:43:25,114 --> 00:43:28,555
No! No!

457
00:43:40,891 --> 00:43:42,432
Em!

458
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:29,022
Right.

459
00:44:30,774 --> 00:44:32,156
No, I gotta go.

460
00:44:32,157 --> 00:44:37,075
The judge reviewed everything and is
granting the interim temporary order.

461
00:44:37,076 --> 00:44:39,717
So I can't see my kids?

462
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:43,521
Based on Mrs. Brenek's report
about the bruise marks...

463
00:44:43,522 --> 00:44:46,307
This is ridiculous.
You know I would never hit her.

464
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,873
A full hearing will be scheduled.

465
00:44:48,874 --> 00:44:49,742
Thank you.

466
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:51,484
-Wait, wait. Stephanie.
-Mr. Brenek!

467
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:55,023
Can we talk? Just the two of us?
We can work this out, Stephanie.

468
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:57,030
Mr. Brenek!
You can state your case--

469
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,111
I'm not talking to you!
I'm talking to my wife!

470
00:44:59,112 --> 00:45:01,860
-Steph--
-Don't touch me!

471
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,169
What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?

472
00:45:07,466 --> 00:45:11,333
You destroyed us,
but I won't let you hurt the children.

473
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:15,777
Just move.

474
00:45:15,778 --> 00:45:18,308
Just move to North Carolina.

475
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:22,081
I don't want to see you again.

476
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:34,538
He's clearly unstable.
He's angry and he's confused.

477
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:37,144
He's taking this divorce
out on everyone around him.

478
00:45:37,145 --> 00:45:39,916
It's why Em's has such a hard time.

479
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:41,994
I brought some DVDs over.

480
00:45:41,995 --> 00:45:44,463
I thought we'd all
have a movie night.

481
00:45:44,464 --> 00:45:46,832
That's a great idea.

482
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:49,952
Watch something funny.
Lighten the mood.

483
00:45:51,307 --> 00:45:52,374
Okay.

484
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:01,527
That's your second glass.
Save some for dinner?

485
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:25,732
Hey!

486
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,484
What you got there?

487
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,318
What's in your hand?
Come on.

488
00:46:51,595 --> 00:46:53,404
Can I see it?

489
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,602
Honey, it's okay. Let me see it.

490
00:47:02,815 --> 00:47:04,358
Where'd you get this?

491
00:47:08,145 --> 00:47:09,889
Where'd you get this, Em?

492
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:20,780
It's deliberate...

493
00:47:32,198 --> 00:47:33,002
Em?

494
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:37,553
Em?

495
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:46,298
I think you should leave.

496
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:49,006
I think you should leave now.

497
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:50,982
I don't like you!

498
00:47:52,484 --> 00:47:55,026
You'll have to get used to that.

499
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:07,929
Coach, you looking for the bathroom?

500
00:48:09,346 --> 00:48:11,483
What brings you to my class?

501
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:15,555
Quite a find, Clyde.

502
00:48:15,556 --> 00:48:18,885
That's just it.
I have no idea what I've got here.

503
00:48:18,886 --> 00:48:23,113
From the woodwork, I'd say
it was from Poland, 1920s, '30s.

504
00:48:23,113 --> 00:48:25,289
Probably from a Jewish village...

505
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:30,066
...indicated by these
Hebrew inscriptions.

506
00:48:31,247 --> 00:48:36,056
I think it says, "Dibbuk".

507
00:48:36,057 --> 00:48:39,616
It's the Hebrew word
for "dislocated spirit."

508
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,259
It's a dibbuk box.

509
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,120
So was it used for
something religious?

510
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:47,650
The more traditional
branches of Judaism,

511
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:50,243
especially in the Hasidic sects...

512
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:55,558
...believe in various spirits,
both benevolent and, um...

513
00:48:57,112 --> 00:49:01,816
-Benevolent and--
-Evil. Like demons.

514
00:49:02,836 --> 00:49:04,896
A dibbuk box was
made with the belief...

515
00:49:04,897 --> 00:49:09,159
...that the evil itself
could somehow be contained.

516
00:49:10,287 --> 00:49:11,337
Think of it.

517
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:16,409
If you believed such a thing,
that you could trap a demon.

518
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:23,497
And now,
it's in your hands, Coach Brenek.

519
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:26,234
Carrying around this curse.

520
00:49:26,235 --> 00:49:29,904
Whoo... Very brave man.

521
00:49:31,112 --> 00:49:35,718
Whoever made this box certainly
had intense convictions.

522
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:39,602
It's why they concealed
this lock and carved these words.

523
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:43,332
Basically what they're saying is...

524
00:49:45,406 --> 00:49:48,809
"Warning. Deadly."

525
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:51,657
"Do not open."

526
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:54,856
So, don't open it.

527
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,004
-What are you doing here?
-Where's your sister?

528
00:51:00,005 --> 00:51:02,375
Mom would freak if she knew.

529
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:04,607
I'm not scewing around.
I need to see Emily.

530
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:06,926
She decided to stay home.
She's not feeling very well.

531
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:08,566
Dad!

532
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:24,512
Em.

533
00:51:34,499 --> 00:51:37,943
"Whoever sits in the
refuge of the most high...

534
00:51:37,944 --> 00:51:42,102
"...he shall dwell in
the shade of the Almighty.

535
00:51:42,103 --> 00:51:44,147
"I will say of Hashem...

536
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:48,708
"...He is my refuge,
my fortress, my God.

537
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:51,978
"I will trust in Him.

538
00:51:51,979 --> 00:51:55,677
"For He will deliver
you from the ensnaring trap...

539
00:51:55,678 --> 00:51:57,920
...from devastating pestilence..."

540
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:09,192
"With his pinion He will cover you,

541
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:11,569
and beneath His wings
you will be protected.

542
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,534
"His truth is shield...

543
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:22,749
"His truth is shield and armor.

544
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:26,817
You shall not fear
the terror of night, nor--"

545
00:52:36,649 --> 00:52:37,977
Who are you?

546
00:52:40,362 --> 00:52:43,600
What do you want with
my little girl?

547
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,544
You tell me!

548
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:49,456
What do you want?

549
00:52:50,173 --> 00:52:52,225
You tell me!

550
00:52:52,226 --> 00:52:54,153
Clyde!

551
00:52:54,154 --> 00:52:56,685
What are you doing here? Get out!

552
00:52:56,686 --> 00:53:00,322
Get out of the house!
I'll call the police. Get out!

553
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,973
<i>Babylon your throne</i>

554
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:59,763
<i>Down, down, down</i>

555
00:53:59,764 --> 00:54:05,139
<i>Babylon your throne down</i>

556
00:54:06,552 --> 00:54:11,613
<i>One bright morning
when my work is over</i>

557
00:54:11,613 --> 00:54:14,492
<i>I'm going to fly--</i>

558
00:54:14,493 --> 00:54:15,999
Excuse me.

559
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:17,487
Sorry.

560
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,589
I get kind of lost when I'm listening.

561
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,033
My name is Clyde Brenek.
I'm looking for Tzadok Shapir.

562
00:54:23,034 --> 00:54:24,530
Yeah, that's me.

563
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:27,477
-We talked on the phone.
-Thanks for meeting me.

564
00:54:29,374 --> 00:54:30,900
Is that it?

565
00:54:32,006 --> 00:54:33,711
Yeah.

566
00:54:35,763 --> 00:54:39,811
All right. I'll take you
to see my father the Rebbe Shapir...

567
00:54:39,812 --> 00:54:43,027
...but I must tell you, he's traditional.

568
00:54:43,028 --> 00:54:45,030
Okay.

569
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,243
Alright.
Everyone's waiting in the shul.

570
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,680
My father asks if you could show
what's in the bag.

571
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:44,597
Tzadok Shapir wants to know where you got it.

572
00:55:44,598 --> 00:55:46,902
I bought it at a yard sale.

573
00:55:46,903 --> 00:55:49,363
Did you open it?

574
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:55,926
Tell us, did you open the box?

575
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:59,133
My daughter...

576
00:55:59,134 --> 00:56:00,961
My daughter opened it.

577
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:09,376
What does this thing
want with my daughter?

578
00:56:12,753 --> 00:56:16,354
The dibbuk looks for innocence.
A pure soul.

579
00:56:16,355 --> 00:56:20,555
It will move back
and forth from the box...

580
00:56:20,556 --> 00:56:23,261
...searching for a proper host.

581
00:56:23,262 --> 00:56:27,572
The host begins to hear voices...
experience visions.

582
00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:30,667
All of this is the
deception of the spirit...

583
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:34,069
...to protect the host
and drive others away.

584
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,894
The final stage is when the
dibbuk attaches to the host....

585
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,327
...the two becoming one.

586
00:56:41,328 --> 00:56:45,849
It will feed and take
until there is nothing left.

587
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:50,743
It wants only one thing--
that which it does not have.

588
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:52,447
<i>Leiben.</i>

589
00:56:52,448 --> 00:56:54,211
Life.

590
00:57:08,536 --> 00:57:10,996
How do I stop it?

591
00:57:12,317 --> 00:57:13,898
The only way to stop the dibbuk...

592
00:57:13,899 --> 00:57:19,152
...is by commanding it
back into the box by its name.

593
00:57:19,153 --> 00:57:20,535
I don't have its name.

594
00:57:21,764 --> 00:57:25,424
This is what I have.
I need your help.

595
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:32,624
I saw this ceremony, an exorcism.

596
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:35,184
It is too great of a risk.

597
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:39,292
The dibbuk could come upon anyone
attempting to perform the ceremony.

598
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:40,506
No.

599
00:57:42,107 --> 00:57:44,751
No, wait. Wait, please.

600
00:57:46,785 --> 00:57:50,028
Someone here has to help me.

601
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:52,797
It's not my little girl anymore.

602
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:57,508
When I look at her,
it's this thing looking back at me.

603
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:04,173
But my little girl,
Emily, she's in there, right?

604
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:07,710
Please tell me she's in there.

605
00:58:07,711 --> 00:58:10,497
You have to help me.

606
00:58:25,888 --> 00:58:30,579
This must be left to the will of God.

607
00:58:33,156 --> 00:58:36,393
The will of God?

608
00:58:39,805 --> 00:58:45,803
If this were your child, would
you leave it to the will of God?

609
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,002
Mr. Brenek?

610
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:11,423
I'm coming with you.

611
00:59:11,424 --> 00:59:12,771
Why?

612
00:59:12,772 --> 00:59:16,932
Pikuach nefesh. A permitted
violation of a Shabbat law.

613
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:21,866
A human life is in danger. I am not
only allowed, but required to act.

614
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:25,025
Let's go.

615
01:00:48,563 --> 01:00:49,807
Em...

616
01:00:52,771 --> 01:00:54,700
What are you doing?

617
01:00:55,908 --> 01:00:57,132
Emma...

618
01:01:00,975 --> 01:01:02,651
Give me that, sweetie.

619
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,217
-Emily, what are you doing?
-Em's not here!

620
01:01:14,218 --> 01:01:17,986
It's okay, baby.
Come here. Come here.

621
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:22,406
You just stop this right now.
Come here. Come to Mommy.

622
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:23,445
No!

623
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:26,575
I'm not playing games now, Emily.

624
01:01:26,576 --> 01:01:31,900
I said, Em's not here!

625
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:35,809
Emily... come here, honey.

626
01:01:49,142 --> 01:01:50,435
Em, where are you?

627
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:56,834
Emily, come here, baby.

628
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,755
Come here.

629
01:02:15,071 --> 01:02:18,696
Em, where are you?

630
01:02:21,925 --> 01:02:22,872
Em?

631
01:02:32,539 --> 01:02:34,322
Emily?

632
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:39,959
Where are you?

633
01:02:47,876 --> 01:02:51,097
Mom, who am I?

634
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,136
Oh, baby...

635
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:57,173
Who am I, Mommy?

636
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:08,112
Her face...

637
01:03:08,113 --> 01:03:11,354
...you should have seen it.

638
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:15,918
I was actually scared.

639
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:20,237
I've never seen anything like that.

640
01:03:21,918 --> 01:03:26,175
With everything going on,
we need to have her see someone.

641
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:29,437
I called a friend of mine.

642
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,169
She's a mental health specialist.
She works with kids all the time.

643
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:34,090
She says she can see Em tomorrow morning.

644
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:38,076
Spend a couple days,
give her a full evaluation.

645
01:03:38,077 --> 01:03:39,447
Okay.

646
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,567
You could tell Em that we're just
going away for the weekend.

647
01:04:05,305 --> 01:04:09,082
Okay, everybody, let's go!

648
01:04:19,946 --> 01:04:21,568
Emily?

649
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:22,591
Brett?

650
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:30,590
You okay?

651
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,032
Em?

652
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:15,557
Em?

653
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:19,848
-Hannah!
-What's going on?

654
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,085
Call 911!

655
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:25,878
What's wrong with her, Mom?

656
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,352
There must be a name.

657
01:05:41,353 --> 01:05:43,563
I searched every inch of that box.

658
01:05:45,277 --> 01:05:49,378
The carvings, a prayer...

659
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:51,182
...the tokens placed inside...

660
01:05:51,183 --> 01:05:52,661
...but why there is mirror?

661
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:57,716
If the spirit was contained,
it would have to look upon itself...

662
01:05:57,717 --> 01:06:01,019
...to be forever reminded
it turned away from God.

663
01:06:02,294 --> 01:06:03,193
Jesus.

664
01:06:08,734 --> 01:06:14,213
"Abyzou."

665
01:06:14,214 --> 01:06:16,282
"Abyzou.

666
01:06:16,282 --> 01:06:19,774
Taker of children."

667
01:06:24,736 --> 01:06:26,322
Hurry.

668
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:36,049
I'd like to schedule
an MRI right away.

669
01:06:36,049 --> 01:06:36,891
Okay.

670
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:40,672
Emily, we're going to
slide you into this machine.

671
01:06:40,673 --> 01:06:45,441
Think of it as a big camera.
Let's us take a look inside.

672
01:06:45,442 --> 01:06:47,121
-Am I okay?
-Yeah, baby.

673
01:06:47,122 --> 01:06:50,083
Everything's gonna be all right.
Don't be afraid. Okay?

674
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:53,035
We'll be in the other room. Okay?

675
01:06:53,036 --> 01:06:57,029
You'll hear noises, Emily.
It's nothing to be scared of.

676
01:06:58,239 --> 01:06:59,404
I love you.

677
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:01,817
I need you to stay very very still.

678
01:07:10,848 --> 01:07:13,160
All right, here we go.

679
01:07:26,312 --> 01:07:27,521
Can I close my eyes?

680
01:07:27,522 --> 01:07:28,895
<i>Of course.</i>

681
01:07:28,896 --> 01:07:30,631
<i>We're gonna start taking pictures now.</i>

682
01:07:37,669 --> 01:07:40,755
Looking good. Good tissue.

683
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,679
<i>You're doing great, Emily.</i>

684
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:20,772
What's happening?
Is she all right in there by herself?

685
01:08:20,773 --> 01:08:23,027
She's fine.
Get somebody else up here.

686
01:08:23,028 --> 01:08:24,400
What's going on?

687
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:27,263
This happens occasionally.

688
01:08:42,429 --> 01:08:44,060
Oh, my god.

689
01:08:47,614 --> 01:08:49,285
There is something else in there with her!

690
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:17,794
Hey.

691
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:20,061
Hi.

692
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:24,374
-Dad, I'm so sorry.
-No.

693
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:40,142
I saw... something...

694
01:09:44,312 --> 01:09:46,975
I saw something in her.

695
01:09:46,976 --> 01:09:50,574
The doctors,
they can't help us, can they?

696
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:54,359
Just, I need you to trust me, okay?

697
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,470
Can you get her out?

698
01:09:57,471 --> 01:10:00,292
No. We're going to have to do it here.

699
01:10:00,293 --> 01:10:01,190
Here?

700
01:10:02,048 --> 01:10:03,663
Great.

701
01:10:06,418 --> 01:10:10,220
I hate hospitals. People die here.

702
01:10:16,482 --> 01:10:17,208
Hey.

703
01:10:18,676 --> 01:10:22,365
This is Tzadok.
Tzadok, this is my family.

704
01:10:24,005 --> 01:10:25,663
Thank you for coming.

705
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,916
-Can you help us?
-Of course.

706
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:33,407
Do I look like a doctor?

707
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:46,221
It doesn't want me here.
We need a private place.

708
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:09,927
Thank you.

709
01:11:16,632 --> 01:11:19,752
There's a therapy room down there.
My players use it sometimes.

710
01:11:19,753 --> 01:11:21,744
No one uses it after 6:00.

711
01:11:35,662 --> 01:11:37,168
Oh, baby.

712
01:11:37,169 --> 01:11:39,139
-Light these candles.
-How many?

713
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:39,941
Seven.

714
01:11:47,916 --> 01:11:51,516
Put something from
your heart in the box.

715
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:54,276
This essence will bind the prayer.

716
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:55,925
This belonged to my grandfather.

717
01:11:55,926 --> 01:11:58,421
The strength of my family is with us.

718
01:11:58,422 --> 01:11:59,976
Hannah? Honey?

719
01:12:03,414 --> 01:12:04,171
Stephanie.

720
01:12:06,936 --> 01:12:07,824
Your wedding ring.

721
01:12:08,466 --> 01:12:10,611
Once we begin,
we must complete the ceremony.

722
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:12,888
The dibbuk will do
everything it can to stop us.

723
01:12:12,889 --> 01:12:17,177
Even in the face of evil,
our faith must remain unwaver.

724
01:12:17,178 --> 01:12:19,074
-Okay.
-Please, God.

725
01:12:19,843 --> 01:12:22,653
Oil of two olive trees.
Oil represents light.

726
01:12:22,654 --> 01:12:24,241
Water represents darkness.

727
01:12:24,242 --> 01:12:29,674
May God separate between these two
as only light can dispel darkness.

728
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,794
"Nor the destruction
that ravages at noon.

729
01:12:44,795 --> 01:12:46,693
"Put Your hands on her.

730
01:12:46,694 --> 01:12:49,352
"You need only look with Your eyes...

731
01:12:49,353 --> 01:12:52,122
...and the punishment
of the wicked illuminator."

732
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:04,664
Shut up!

733
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:09,955
You take me! Take me!

734
01:13:12,033 --> 01:13:15,459
Everybody, put your hands on her!

735
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:18,964
Cast all fear from your hearts!

736
01:13:26,629 --> 01:13:28,321
You die!

737
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:34,345
Emily!

738
01:13:36,301 --> 01:13:37,590
Daddy!

739
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:40,206
You let me daughter go! Take me!

740
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:41,805
You take me instead!

741
01:13:41,806 --> 01:13:45,716
No!

742
01:13:48,943 --> 01:13:51,440
That is no longer your daughter!

743
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:09,999
Em?

744
01:14:23,336 --> 01:14:24,253
Em?

745
01:14:58,788 --> 01:15:00,954
Daddy, you scared me.

746
01:15:05,313 --> 01:15:07,831
Daddy, you scared me.

747
01:15:13,332 --> 01:15:15,754
Daddy, you scared me.

748
01:15:21,979 --> 01:15:24,238
Daddy, you scared me.

749
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,251
Daddy, you scare me.

750
01:15:35,909 --> 01:15:39,639
Dad, you scare me.

751
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:13,662
Take me! You take me instead!

752
01:16:15,545 --> 01:16:16,731
Em!

753
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:18,991
Clyde?

754
01:16:31,423 --> 01:16:33,532
Daddy?

755
01:16:33,533 --> 01:16:35,604
Em, is that you?

756
01:16:42,236 --> 01:16:43,266
Clyde!

757
01:16:58,211 --> 01:16:59,519
Daddy?

758
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,428
Is it okay? Okay?

759
01:17:05,428 --> 01:17:07,992
-Em...
-Oh, thank god.

760
01:17:07,993 --> 01:17:11,660
All right.

761
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:12,967
This is all wrong.

762
01:17:12,968 --> 01:17:15,360
Guys, this is not right.

763
01:17:15,361 --> 01:17:17,151
Where is it?

764
01:17:18,269 --> 01:17:19,777
Where's the Dibbuk?

765
01:17:21,982 --> 01:17:24,107
Abyzou.

766
01:17:24,108 --> 01:17:27,933
Abyzou. Abyzou.

767
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:30,019
Abyzou!

768
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,614
Abyzou!

769
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:38,828
Abyzou!

770
01:17:41,821 --> 01:17:47,541
Abyzou!

771
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:54,180
Abyzou!

772
01:17:54,181 --> 01:17:58,133
Abyzou!

773
01:17:58,134 --> 01:18:02,814
Abyzou!

774
01:18:02,815 --> 01:18:04,003
Hannah!

775
01:18:04,004 --> 01:18:08,593
Abyzou!

776
01:18:12,628 --> 01:18:15,921
No! No!

777
01:18:19,749 --> 01:18:24,779
I say to you that He will
save you from the ensnaring trap!

778
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:29,408
He will instruct His angels in your
behalf to guard you in all your ways.

779
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:38,267
I say to you in the name of God,
leave this flesh!

780
01:18:38,268 --> 01:18:41,701
Abyzou!

781
01:18:48,022 --> 01:18:51,309
He will save you from
the destruction and pestilence.

782
01:18:59,005 --> 01:19:06,543
Abyzou!

783
01:19:10,406 --> 01:19:13,963
You are cast away
from the eyes of God!

784
01:19:13,963 --> 01:19:15,326
Daddy!

785
01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:18,562
Abyzou!

786
01:20:06,989 --> 01:20:08,296
Hannah?

787
01:20:11,104 --> 01:20:12,847
Daddy...

788
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:18,142
It's okay.

789
01:20:58,890 --> 01:20:59,814
Hi.

790
01:21:42,919 --> 01:21:47,465
Oh, it's just a cough.

791
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,069
Tzadok, hey!
I'm calling to say thank you.

792
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:05,497
Clyde! I was going to call.
I need to get your car back to you.

793
01:22:05,498 --> 01:22:08,529
You keep it.
I am not gonna be going anywhere.

794
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:10,516
How's the family?

795
01:22:10,517 --> 01:22:13,339
Perfect. More than perfect.

796
01:22:14,011 --> 01:22:16,673
-So what are you gonna do with it?
-I'm not sure.

797
01:22:16,674 --> 01:22:19,907
I'm gonna speak with my father.
We'll find a safe place for it.

798
01:22:19,908 --> 01:22:22,925
Okay. Goodbye, Tzadok.

799
01:22:22,926 --> 01:22:24,506
Goodbye, Clyde.

800
01:22:56,007 --> 01:23:00,076
