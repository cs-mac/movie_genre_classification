1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:13,399


2
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:20,724


3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
My name is Jerrod Hartfeld.

4
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:36,825
A video production company lead. Here in California.

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,350
The reality is mainly specialized in broadcasting.

6
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:45,175
The Tornado Hunter show is on our own.

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,100
Letter from a shooting.

8
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,925
The presentation was part of a new reality series. The title is deadly.

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,250
Lance Preston Young was the producer.

10
00:00:57,275 --> 00:01:01,875
The idea was that he and a few paranormal investigator

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,700
felderítenek spirits, places and things as related.

12
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:11,125
Has been for many years before these types of programs like this.

13
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,450
I did not think it's time.

14
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,175
My name is Lance Preston.

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,100
Even when I was a kid my parents moved to a haunted house.

16
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,525
With that we are there, stayed with me forever.

17
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,850
Since then, the obsession was to record

18
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,275
and demonstrate that these things are real.

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,800
Hug and paranormal expert nyomozóimmal

20
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:37,425
felgöndörítjük as the current most popular hangouts.

21
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,150
We'll be all night, and everything you add!

22
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:44,175
When finished, it's time for some

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Meeting of the grave!

24
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:50,625
Everything went pretty well.

25
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,350
The cut was good. We were very excited.

26
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,675
At last there was something.

27
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,700
Then came the sixth.

28
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,525
Want to say something?

29
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,550
Yes! I want to clarify this.

30
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:12,175
What you see now is not a movie.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,700
No?

32
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:19,225
We have dozens of hours of raw material together.

33
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,850
A rabbit second, we can not in any way.

34
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,275
This is simply raw összevágtuk only.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,800
(Do not copy the movie)

36
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:41,725
Signal!

37
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,650
Hello! Hello! Test Site, you!

38
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:47,275
Lance Preston.

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,300
I do, so you will be able to go through the background.

40
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:51,125
He moved a little, but ...

41
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,050
Ready? I'm ready!

42
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:56,275
Still there. Only what I want.

43
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,300
A little further back. Is that good?

44
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:04,025
Good afternoon! Welcome to the new section of encounters with death.

45
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,250
As always, I am a presenter. Lance Preston.

46
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:08,475
I am very happy to welcome you today

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,300
One of the most terrifying scene I have ever seen.

48
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,825
Collingwood is located behind the psychiatric hospital.

49
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,150
This is one of six buildings, an area of ??80 hectares.

50
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,975
Wait, wait, here comes a car.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,600
From there, Matt, I'm not saying it again.

52
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:28,025
Between 1895 and 1960

53
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,850
More than 80,000 sick and mentally disturbed man was home.

54
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:40,075
1963 after the closure of several ghosts seen.

55
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:47,400
Objects that are moving by themselves. Sometimes you can hear the laughter of a madman.

56
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:53,625
Tonight! My team and I have closed eight hours here.

57
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,650
The trap closes private sunlight.

58
00:03:57,675 --> 00:04:00,775
The more advanced tools Ghostbusters

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Collingwood House of psychiatric cases to hunt ghosts.

60
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,925
Court. Nice!

61
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,750
Yes?

62
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,575
Morgan! Morgan Turner! Hello! Yes! Hello!

63
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,400
Sorry! Thanks for coming!

64
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,325
I know the roads and all that. Never mind.

65
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,050
I am delighted that csinálhatom.

66
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:22,075
It will really be on TV? Yes!

67
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,800
In this hope! This section is not, just buy!

68
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:25,425
Do not worry, everything it collects.

69
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,550
Morgan Turner is with me.

70
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:29,975
Local historian, who is here with us,

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,300
to shed light on the dark past of the hospital.

72
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:36,425
Morgan? Can you say that when the school was built?

73
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,950
The story is very similar to Collingwood in similar institutes.

74
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:44,275
Built in 1893

75
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,800
to relieve the county hospital shoulder the load.

76
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:54,425
Then, of course, is not understood as a mental illness.

77
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,550
A pioneering treatment early.

78
00:04:55,575 --> 00:05:00,175
It is that mental health services more like a szeméttelepnek

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,400
The members of the family were embarrassed.

80
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:05,625
I see.

81
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,250
The conditions were minimal.

82
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:13,975
People sometimes slept on the floor without blankets or clothing.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,100
In fact, there was something fun place.

84
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,925
Can you tell us something about Arthur Freinken?

85
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:23,549
His story is perhaps the most interesting.

86
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,774
Of course! I ask.

87
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:28,599
Harvard neurosurgeon Freinken above.

88
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:32,424
It was placed here between 1937-1948.

89
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:38,349
The agymûtétes experiments because there was a small rebellion.

90
00:05:38,374 --> 00:05:42,174
He was the mainstay of the frontal lobe surgery.

91
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,299
About 140 of the frontal lobe surgery performed.

92
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:52,724
August 15, 1948 in six patients with the outbreak of the room

93
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:58,049
Freinken and was stabbed in his office. His body was found the next day a nurse.

94
00:05:58,074 --> 00:06:05,074
This death was completely irrelevant to the death of the famous baseball player.

95
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,199
Wow! This story is very happy!

96
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:12,224
Morgan, our honest opinion, do you believe in ghosts?

97
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:20,049
I do not know, but if there is a good place to find them.

98
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:24,974
The traffic today was really shitty. He also had six hours of high from it.

99
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,499
Death awaits you. Oh my God!

100
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:31,124
I think we'll see. This is very lame!

101
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:37,449
This may take a while, this is an old lock. We should not have to use it.

102
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:38,674
Take it easy, buddy.

103
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,699
Slow down, the background music. All fear.

104
00:06:42,724 --> 00:06:47,124
Well, that's it! We're fine.

105
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:49,049
Come on.

106
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:53,974
Oh my God!

107
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,999
This is the main entrance.

108
00:06:57,724 --> 00:06:59,324
Nice! Yes!

109
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:03,749
If they are members of the family, then there is the reception they were able to login.

110
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:06,474
This is fucking scary! This is crazy!

111
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:08,599
The take? Buy it!

112
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:10,224
I wish to record it!

113
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,349
No smoking.

114
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:16,774
Stumped, can not. There are fire alarm.

115
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,999
Here I am Kenny Sandivol. Current caretaker, was eight years ago.

116
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,524
Kenny! Do you think this place is haunted?

117
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,149
Well ... I have not done before. Talk to you or the camera?

118
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:32,474
Yes! Note that this is not ...

119
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:38,299
I'm not sure to believe in ghosts or souls or anything, but

120
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,124
I have been here I've seen strange things.

121
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:47,149
Especially at night you can hear the sounds of pipe and construction sounds.

122
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:52,574
It is very hard to tell, but it's as if they were not alone.

123
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,399
Come on, let's see!

124
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:58,724
Come on. Well.

125
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,149
It's like those tartanának corridors forever.

126
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:02,374
Yes.

127
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,899
Hard to believe that there are thousands of happy people.

128
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:07,124
There were thousands of people.

129
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,649
Day is so dark here.

130
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:13,174
Are you afraid? Yes.

131
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,199
There are certain ways I will show you where.

132
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:21,424
Guys! If it is dark now, you may want to wait until tomorrow.

133
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:23,849
Not all working lights, very dark.

134
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:26,874
Guys, see the following screen. Yes.

135
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:33,699
Good evening closes, but will be open for a couple of times in the morning.

136
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:34,924
What?

137
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,149
I can say.

138
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:39,974
It is as if something or someone who would want to go or something.

139
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:43,099
This is a paranormal hotspot.

140
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:48,624
It will be good? Perfect.

141
00:08:56,849 --> 00:09:01,149
Helping people in these small rooms?

142
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:07,274
Oh my God! This is officially the ass!

143
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:10,399
Is this true? Yes, quite true.

144
00:09:11,424 --> 00:09:16,224
A couple of years a person was here. That did it.

145
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:18,249
He spent the time to scribble on the wall.

146
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:20,974
So it's a real sick room?

147
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,199
Here was a real patient. Really?

148
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:26,824
I do not know if he died here, but it was long ago.

149
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:28,449
Very afraid.

150
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:34,074
What the fuck? Kenny! This is great!

151
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,299
The man, the sound sucks.

152
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:37,824
Is this true?

153
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:41,149
Probably a girl committed suicide.

154
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,274
What? Here?

155
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:48,299
One patient committed suicide? Yes, slashed his wrists in the bathtub.

156
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:50,524
Oh my God, this is very sad.

157
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,449
They say some people, this room have heard that the water flows.

158
00:09:53,474 --> 00:09:55,874
I have never heard such a thing.

159
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:57,299
Where do we go now?

160
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:58,724
The service tunnel running.

161
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,249
I can not wait to see it.

162
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,474
Are you okay?

163
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:09,299
Kenny! That's exactly what I was looking for!

164
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,424
These tunnels connecting the buildings.

165
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,249
Almost a mile long.

166
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:19,974
Aware of how easy it is to lose here.

167
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:28,499
Once, when I got here, the wind is very cold.

168
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:33,224
As if it stops. I felt like someone to listen.

169
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:37,549
Very strange feeling.

170
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,974
What is it? Only the shadow.

171
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:47,099
This is Garry Krefeld in Krefeld company.

172
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:50,524
It worked a little behind.

173
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,149
Is that true?

174
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:56,274
In 1983, another attempt to revive the state space

175
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:00,299
but in the end everything will be scratched. Damn, sorry.

176
00:11:00,324 --> 00:11:02,624
Say again? Yes, it would be nice.

177
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:07,049
Me and my team so we've been here for two weeks.

178
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:09,874
Have you ever met a supernatural phenomenon?

179
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:20,199
The boys thought they heard voices. Then he went a few tools.

180
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:24,524
I thought it was thieves. But I did not see anyone, so ...

181
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,149
It was an accident! Yes.

182
00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:31,174
A man went up the ladder. Right there.

183
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,299
He swears that something is pushed down the stairs. Nagyott fell.

184
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:39,824
I hit my knees, and then quit.

185
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:43,949
This is not a new vibrator, but it was a smart ghost.

186
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:49,774
The new ghost shaking like an echo of the past.

187
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,799
Again and again through it all.

188
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:55,324
The intelligent ghost, is actually a soul.

189
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,649
Interaction with the intent to influence.

190
00:11:57,674 --> 00:12:02,874
The pressure has been reported, and dobásról karmolásról well.

191
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:05,299
Bizarre, but it happens.

192
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,324
So the two of you that many of you are here?

193
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,049
Yes, many children come here gímibõl.

194
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:13,874
Csavarogni.

195
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,099
You see anything?

196
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:17,224
Yes.

197
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:20,349
It was here we were.

198
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:24,374
Here. Smároltunk. But all the same.

199
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:33,099
I looked up and I swear to God. I swear I saw someone there.

200
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:40,424
Blanca ... Mantle at home ... ... Yes, I wore white robes at home.

201
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:42,849
He was a skinhead.

202
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,874
Projection Operation wrong.

203
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,899
Why not ask the custodian quickly?

204
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:56,424
Sorry! Excuse me, sir!

205
00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:00,749
A television programs, an interview would you like?

206
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:04,074
I'm standing here next to the current problems.

207
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:08,599
Noticed something strange in the house?

208
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:11,424
No! Not really. What do you mean?

209
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:16,049
Well, I heard strange sounds, or have you seen ghosts?

210
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:17,874
I just started working here.

211
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,899
It started to work. This is very good.

212
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:24,424
TC could relax a little? What if you play to the camera?

213
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:25,649
He made as if you see anything?

214
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,773
I have to go back to work. Well.

215
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:33,398
It will be fast, wait, wait! Do you have a little more?

216
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,923
Here's $ 20!

217
00:13:38,448 --> 00:13:42,348
I'm standing here next to the current problems.

218
00:13:42,373 --> 00:13:46,373
Noticed something strange in the last 10 years?

219
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:50,298
Yes, I saw a ghost. Here.

220
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:52,623
It was very frightening.

221
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:56,848
A building next to the spirit. Unbelievable.

222
00:13:56,873 --> 00:14:01,973
This is a paranormal hot spot you've never seen before.

223
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:04,798
Three. Two, one ...

224
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:13,023
The location and size of the scope of their medium heat.

225
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:16,648
Gray Houston will help in the investigation.

226
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:21,273
Houston! Feel anything?

227
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:27,273
Wow! What energy is here!

228
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:31,198
As if thousands of people speaking at once!

229
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:34,923
Here's something else.

230
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:44,747
Here's something else.

231
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:47,072
Dark Soul!

232
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:49,897
It is possible that a demon!

233
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,822
Tonight, we must be very careful!

234
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:57,047
We do not want such a thing have fun! Of course!

235
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:02,572
That's it!

236
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:04,797
I still feel something?

237
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,822
Yes.

238
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:11,247
I feel a great sadness here.

239
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:13,872
A deep sadness.

240
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:27,097
I see a patient. Female patients. A girl. No water here. Red. Red water.

241
00:15:28,522 --> 00:15:39,122
Blood. Blood. He died here. He slashed his wrists in the bathtub.

242
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:43,247
The guard said that a girl committed suicide here.

243
00:15:43,272 --> 00:15:45,272
Houston! This is amazing!

244
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:48,797
The spirit is still with us.

245
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:54,322
Court.

246
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:55,547
Yes!

247
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,272
It was too much? No!

248
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:09,697
Lance! How do you feel your back? I feel good.

249
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:10,922
This is a good place.

250
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:15,647
Do you think we're seeing now is the spirit? Yes, thousands of people. Sure.

251
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:18,972
Wow! They become a little less antiseptic.

252
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:24,997
It would be nice. But if it fails, at least something good should ijesztgetõs.

253
00:16:26,122 --> 00:16:29,522
Wait, wait! TC

254
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:32,047
Want to be a beautiful sunset?

255
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:34,172
Bitch!

256
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:03,897
Camera window, go!

257
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:22,622
Okay, it's fucking scary! I go from here.

258
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:39,547
Here are the current technical wizards, Matt.

259
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:42,272
Matt! Why not take us through what you are doing?

260
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:45,997
Ten cameras love the hot spots.

261
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:47,722
You can take them all on tape.

262
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:49,747
But back to the hard drive.

263
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:52,572
Everything here comes my wireless equipment.

264
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:55,097
He always knows what is happening.

265
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:58,222
Soon, Matt. What time is it?

266
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:04,647
This is a discussion of EMF. Electricity is detected in the air.

267
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:12,972
People are not energy but kileng paranormal activity.

268
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,397
Infrared sensor.

269
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:20,022
Like the EMF, but it shows the temperature change.

270
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:23,147
The spirits are believed to cause a change in temperature.

271
00:19:23,172 --> 00:19:25,472
These are called cold spots in business.

272
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:28,097
One, two, three.

273
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:31,322
This is a normal voice recorder. Well.

274
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:34,547
EVP-t buy it. Wait, just as quickly.

275
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:38,672
That explained what EVP.

276
00:19:38,697 --> 00:19:40,897
Electronic voice phenomenon.

277
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:45,622
These include the sounds that people can not hear.

278
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:50,347
and if you hear something, we know that someone wants to communicate.

279
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:53,672
This is my favorite. Talk Geiger.

280
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:57,797
On. Go. Look at this. Hard fucking.

281
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:04,422
I guarantee that if something paranormal, you will receive.

282
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:08,647
Well, now we close!

283
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:12,972
My friend Kenny is it locked out.

284
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:17,697
Kenny! Thanks for everything. See you at 6 am kkor!

285
00:20:17,722 --> 00:20:20,022
Exactly 6 hours! Good luck!

286
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:26,047
I am a demon! Demon child!

287
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:28,272
I can not wait to see it in the morning ...

288
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,697
You see, we spent all night with a stranger.

289
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:37,622
What are you doing? I talked to Kenny.

290
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:41,747
He shut the door? Fear not, because the show is.

291
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,572
What if you need something outside?

292
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:46,297
Very good! This is a real thing, folks!

293
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:51,322
This is where the largest ever investigated!

294
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:53,347
And the most dangerous!

295
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:58,572
I draw your attention, was built as a prison.

296
00:20:58,597 --> 00:21:04,097
Since there is a grid of the window. He would not leave, even if we wanted.

297
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:09,522
Kenny does not arrive until tomorrow, trapped in this desperate.

298
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:12,547
We will work in total darkness.

299
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:16,072
Three dark vision camera, all collected.

300
00:21:16,097 --> 00:21:19,997
Matt is a hot spot for static cameras.

301
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:23,422
Well around the world. When finished, it's time for some

302
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:28,847
Ghostly encounter!

303
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:34,672
Very good! Now walk through the halls of Western institutions.

304
00:21:36,697 --> 00:21:39,597
More than 50 years, abandoned.

305
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:44,622
We are looking for souls who are not comfortable when they lived.

306
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:47,947
And he probably is not based on the afterlife.

307
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:52,872
This feeling, this is great. It's cold for that.

308
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:58,197
This was the corridor that could be the person seen with a shaved head

309
00:21:58,222 --> 00:22:00,522
down the hall.

310
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,947
Sasha, the EVP-t switch.

311
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:06,872
Is there anyone here with us?

312
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:12,097
You're a sick or away?

313
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:15,722
Here they have lived in the house? Play again!

314
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,847
"Is there anyone here with us?"

315
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:24,172
"You're a sick here?"

316
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:29,097
"Here have lived in the house?"

317
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:34,222
Nothing.

318
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,547
Wait a minute! I felt like ...

319
00:22:37,172 --> 00:22:40,072
Spirit, do not be afraid of us!

320
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:42,497
If so, show yourself!

321
00:22:43,722 --> 00:22:46,822
I think this cold is based. He wants to cheat.

322
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:48,847
She wants to go to this!

323
00:22:48,872 --> 00:22:54,672
If you have a soul here with us, give me some sign.

324
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:57,697
Open the window!

325
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:00,522
Just a little!

326
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:14,547
Now I use this camera to take some kind of phenomenon.

327
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:17,072
Usually, no human eye sees.

328
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:19,897
Recognize photography as a ghost.

329
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:28,522
One more.

330
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:30,547
We have to wait until the photos are ready.

331
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:35,272
If there is a ghost behind me, I know it later.

332
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:43,097
You're the one who writes these walls?

333
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,822
Or just want to communicate?

334
00:23:51,747 --> 00:23:54,847
Why do not you contact me?

335
00:24:01,572 --> 00:24:10,972
If a patient who committed suicide in the bathtub, in this present

336
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:15,097
you show!

337
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:23,722
I'm usually in the Horn!

338
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:27,447
Camera 2 and 4 inches, has a temperature phenomenon.

339
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:35,972
Guys, why do I have to sit here alone?

340
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:40,897
You said that you feel something?

341
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:44,922
Very, very dark negative energy I feel here.

342
00:24:45,547 --> 00:24:51,847
Not only energy, much, much soul.

343
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:57,772
If you have in mind, please introduce yourself!

344
00:25:00,797 --> 00:25:03,497
Give us some sound!

345
00:25:04,422 --> 00:25:08,822
As I said, these tunnels as if we tartanának.

346
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:12,647
The smell is normal.

347
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:16,572
Did you hear that? I've heard.

348
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:25,997
Well, I heard something. What the hell is that?

349
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:28,922
I do not know, come here. This way. Follow me.

350
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:32,747
Where does that sound? Behind the door.

351
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:34,372
There.

352
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:37,797
Damn. Do you want to open it? You can slide the camera?

353
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:40,522
Yes Not really, but ... Damn.

354
00:25:40,547 --> 00:25:43,247
Son of a bitch.

355
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:51,672
Shut up! Rats!

356
00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:53,597
Can you believe this? Really?

357
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:56,522
This is not a big deal. Pet.

358
00:25:56,547 --> 00:25:59,947
You are a very big cock. This is not funny.

359
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:02,872
This place is as popular as Tesco!

360
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:03,197
This can make a real electro-plasma material.

361
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:06,622
The first thing we discovered in our team.

362
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:11,772
I think they should go once at the top.

363
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,197
I need a shot just over the top runners.

364
00:27:15,222 --> 00:27:18,822
A broker Lebegue than what we were doing in the castle.

365
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,847
The hell? Yes exactly first class.

366
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,272
Fear, fear, fear.

367
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:39,497
Dead queens! King me!

368
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:44,721
What the fuck?

369
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,846
Glory Hole.

370
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:50,771
Kitchen dead.

371
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:54,996
He told me to do it for my lunch! Bitch!

372
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:58,421
What the hell is this?

373
00:27:58,446 --> 00:28:01,646
This becomes more and more frightening. How I did not notice?

374
00:28:01,671 --> 00:28:04,371
I love Lance.

375
00:28:04,396 --> 00:28:06,896
Damn.

376
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:15,621
That form. Wait, wait.

377
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:22,946
Yes, dear?

378
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:25,871
If you yell, you give him the phone.

379
00:28:26,696 --> 00:28:29,596
Toki Hello!

380
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:33,021
What would you say to the mother? Are you afraid of szörnyektõl under your bed?

381
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,446
We talked about this already?

382
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:40,470
There are no monsters, baby. None.

383
00:28:40,495 --> 00:28:44,295
If so, then we will not get home.

384
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,420
You know that Dad will always take care of you.

385
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:51,145
Tell your mom so you can sleep with him.

386
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,470
Dad will not be home until morning.

387
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:57,895
Tomorrow we pizzázni. Soon I'll be home.

388
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,520
Siamese.

389
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:09,545
Why do I do this myself.

390
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,970
Damn, so cold here.

391
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:23,995
What the hell is that?

392
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,820
Guys, enough! I do not play!

393
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:32,545
Not a good time szarakodni!

394
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,570
What the fuck?

395
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:39,795
Where are you?

396
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Perhaps the wind.

397
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:46,445
Solid. Maybe a tornado to promote awareness. Think how difficult it is?

398
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,970
TC, what was it? Whatever it was, I fucked up.

399
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:52,695
You need to replace the pants, when we returned.

400
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,420
You can not say? I told you, the movie

401
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:58,445
then turned and closed the door of shit.

402
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,270
I thought you are. Added this?

403
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:03,895
I said it first, but you are so busy ...

404
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,420
Are you serious? Added this? Let's see!

405
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:11,445
Oh my God!

406
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,870
This is scary!

407
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:17,995
I accept the apology! I accept the apology!

408
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,420
I can not believe I've seen!

409
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,945
Realizing what he had seen a record

410
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,370
TC by the filmmaker.

411
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:29,095
This is the door behind me slammed shut.

412
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,520
No decks, windows. Not that condenses.

413
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:38,845
We will try to contact them.

414
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:49,270
Is there anyone here with us? Please give me sound.

415
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:53,895
Something Csapkodjatok.

416
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,320
Csapjátok the door a few minutes.

417
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:05,145
Csapjátok in the way you want.

418
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,670
Go ahead. Slap!

419
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,895
Now! Please! Give me a sign!

420
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,020
Spirit! Wake up the screen!

421
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:27,945
If anyone here, please give me a sign ...

422
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,070
Damn! Damn!

423
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:33,395
Totally thought that there is something here.

424
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,520
Damn! What the hell is that?

425
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:38,345
Oh my God!

426
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,570
It was very scary, guys!

427
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:42,695
From here you come!

428
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,120
Damn, I see nothing.

429
00:31:48,145 --> 00:31:50,245
Have you heard?

430
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:58,270
What? Oh, shit!

431
00:31:58,295 --> 00:31:59,895
Your Holy crap!

432
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,320
What the fuck?

433
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:07,545
Hello!

434
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,970
This is pretty fucked up, guys.

435
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:19,295
What the hell is this guys? Up there! Matt?

436
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,120
Matt? Is there anyone in the room?

437
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:25,245
There is someone above us?

438
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,270
No, but what the hell is going on?

439
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:30,495
Obviously, someone who knows that we have traffic and szarakodik.

440
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,620
Why are we at all?

441
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:35,945
Because the sound came from here! Oh my God!

442
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,970
Hello!

443
00:32:37,995 --> 00:32:41,195
Is anyone there? Someone messes with us.

444
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,720
If someone is having fun, not funny!

445
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:50,245
I'm calling the police! We reserve the right to be here!

446
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,070
Do you have permission, but no!

447
00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:55,495
Not so loud now! Shut up, I try to speak.

448
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,020
Guys, come on. What if all this true?

449
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:04,945
Trying is the EVP.

450
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,870
What is your name?

451
00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:11,195
What?

452
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,620
In a room with us?

453
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,345
Where are you?

454
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,470
Come on, Sasha. Play.

455
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:21,695
"What is your name?"

456
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,720
"What?"

457
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:27,045
"A room with us?"

458
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,070
"Where are you?"

459
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:34,195
What's that sound? What is this?

460
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,220
What the hell is that? Added this?

461
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:46,145
I do not believe it, man! I put my tape!

462
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,870
Sasha!

463
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:52,195
Please! Please! I want to go back to the room!

464
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,520
Measure to some shit! Something in me breathe!

465
00:33:55,545 --> 00:34:00,945
You have to go from here! I can no longer be here!

466
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,970
Stop! Wait a minute! Why wait?

467
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:08,795
It did in five years, but I've never seen anything like that.

468
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,620
I do not care, I just want to clear the fuck out of here.

469
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:16,245
Houston, lekíséred and come back here. No? Well.

470
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,270
I would prefer below. No! No!

471
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:20,695
We still have a face to the camera.

472
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,420
Damn I'm afraid not think it will go.

473
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:26,445
T be a professional shit! Keep your character!

474
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,170
I found something! No?

475
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:30,995
You're not doing this to me.

476
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
Well, I'll be back. I'll go with you.

477
00:34:33,745 --> 00:34:36,145
No! No! You're coming with me! Come on!

478
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,270
Why do this? Are you kidding? Have you seen this shit?

479
00:34:39,295 --> 00:34:43,895
If we could get the thing to find millions!

480
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,520
Moments ago, that the corridor

481
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,645
We recorded evidence of the paranormal.

482
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:58,070
Sasha completely terrified, because he touched the back of your mind.

483
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:02,495
We are trying to contact.

484
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,920
Spirit here in this corridor.

485
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:13,645
Please to show a signal. Show yourself!

486
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,770
Please!

487
00:35:19,195 --> 00:35:28,395
If you are still with us, or give me a sign! A sound or touch my hair.

488
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,620
Do you see anything in your hair?

489
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:38,145
No. Wait, give me light. No, nothing.

490
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,570
Do not you dare ask me. Did you know ... We are a team!

491
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:44,095
I think it's gone.

492
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,420
The truth? Playing very scared. Maybe that's all they are doing.

493
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:51,245
Yes! I mean, I do not know.

494
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,870
Come on! If you are doing something!

495
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:58,195
Done, do it again!

496
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,720
What you fear?

497
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:09,545
Jesus Christ! Forget it.

498
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,970
Lance! He's gone. I think playing with us.

499
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:16,895
Plays. Do not talk crazy shit already. Relax a little.

500
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,520
Can we go home?

501
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:23,445
Lance! There are people who all his life in search of answers.

502
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,670
Right.

503
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,195
TC, what time is it?

504
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,120
4:40

505
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,345
Let's go home. What did he say when it comes to people?

506
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:37,370
Guys, I think there is enough vaccine. The bags and go.

507
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,595
It's about going home!

508
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,820
Összepakolsz here? Yes!

509
00:36:42,445 --> 00:36:45,145
I think the eyes.

510
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,670
Are you sure?

511
00:36:49,695 --> 00:36:51,695
Yes, that's all. I think not.

512
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,120
This is not true? Damn! This is a dead end!

513
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:01,845
Guys!

514
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,470
Shit!

515
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:05,895
This is not a good direction!

516
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,120
Come on, come on!

517
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:10,945
TC, buy it! What should I buy?

518
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,370
What are we missing? Do not miss it!

519
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:16,595
Do not miss it! We come to this!

520
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:22,420
Matt! Matt! The stations are?

521
00:37:22,445 --> 00:37:27,345
Matt! We lost, I need some information!

522
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,870
What the fuck is not responding?

523
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:33,495
Do not go there! TC! Why not?

524
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,420
Because we're going back here.

525
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:42,145
If we are going in one direction, we will achieve. No?

526
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,370
What? North?

527
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:48,895
It was just around the corner on the inside of the tub. You know the girl.

528
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,620
We had to do. We had this one, TC!

529
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:56,545
My eyes do not you! Explain that you are looking for in the bathtub. This is not the

bath.

530
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,570
I know it is not.

531
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:01,095
TC! We will be! You said, six hours?

532
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,320
Here the dream? Kenny will be at 6? I can not stay here long.

533
00:38:04,345 --> 00:38:06,545
I can not wait. Can not wait.

534
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,670
I'm not going in the dark. I can not wait.

535
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:18,095
Where are they?

536
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,620
Damn!

537
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:29,745
Where were you? I did not hear that call?

538
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,670
You know what? The tin is a string would have been better.

539
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:37,195
There was nothing in it? No, I'm calling.

540
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,320
Have you heard on the radio?

541
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:42,445
No, I have not heard. You or me? No.

542
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,270
Why not open the door to Lance?

543
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:47,595
Lance!

544
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,020
What I had to close the door?

545
00:38:50,045 --> 00:38:52,345
Good shit sucks!

546
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,770
What do you see? What is it?

547
00:38:54,795 --> 00:38:57,295
The hair of shit! Ah, yes!

548
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,020
Very rude!

549
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:03,145
Add to your computer. No, no, no! No time to do so.

550
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:09,270
Get your cameras. Guys! Rise, let us pack up and up.

551
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:11,095
Kenny will be here soon.

552
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,720
Would anyone. Please. No, no, no!

553
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:16,045
Everyone has to stay here. Sorry.

554
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,970
But things ... I know!

555
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:20,595
You have a radio? Yes, here I am.

556
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,120
Is working well? I hope so.

557
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:26,244
You hear that? Yes, I have.

558
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:28,769
I quickly turn around, right? Very cool, man.

559
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:31,394
Do not leave without me!

560
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,019
Well, it lelépni time here.

561
00:40:02,144 --> 00:40:04,644
Damn!

562
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:09,169
What the fuck?

563
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:19,294
Lance, are you there?

564
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:28,319
Guys, I found something here.

565
00:40:29,044 --> 00:40:30,744
Hello!

566
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:35,669
Lance!

567
00:40:36,994 --> 00:40:38,194
Hello!

568
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:43,019
Guys, do not mess with you!

569
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:02,144
Be reduced in the morning.

570
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:05,269
For an hour we have not seen any phenomenon.

571
00:41:05,294 --> 00:41:08,594
Ghostly encounters. He gives me Preston.

572
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:11,219
Again. No, I have to ...

573
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:13,244
Again.

574
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:17,269
Ghostly encounters. He gives me Preston.

575
00:41:17,494 --> 00:41:20,994
That's it. I'm not doing this.

576
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:26,719
No matter, because the morning light is better.

577
00:41:26,744 --> 00:41:29,044
It's a good idea. Where is Matt?

578
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,669
What the hell is taking so long?

579
00:41:31,694 --> 00:41:33,194
Matt?

580
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:37,019
Matt? Are you there?

581
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:40,844
Matt? Lance!

582
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:43,269
The radio did not work before.

583
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:51,594
Guys! I know it will sound stupid.

584
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:55,319
I am the last person to want to go.

585
00:41:55,344 --> 00:41:59,744
Complete darkness that can be killed and wounded.

586
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:00,969
You're right, it can be damaged.

587
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:07,694
Boys must be found. Very good!

588
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:11,819
This is ridiculous! Let's see!

589
00:42:12,244 --> 00:42:15,644
TC! Bring your camera. Sasha, that's fine. Why?

590
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:18,969
Listen! If so, then add all!

591
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:26,994
Thanks for your help! Hey! It is good to sit here alone!

592
00:42:27,019 --> 00:42:29,219
Oh, my God!

593
00:42:30,044 --> 00:42:31,644
Matt!

594
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:44,569
Where are you? Where the hell are you?

595
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:50,994
What the fuck?

596
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:52,219
Damn.

597
00:42:56,344 --> 00:42:59,844
Why is this shit?

598
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,569
Damn!

599
00:43:06,994 --> 00:43:08,594
Well, well, well!

600
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,619
What if you leave? No, I would not do that!

601
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:15,044
There seems to be elpakolta. It should be here.

602
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:17,969
TC! Exit, Sasha and I do.

603
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:20,794
Why do this? This is a terrible idea!

604
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:23,719
What is it? It must be somewhere! Not to mention things here.

605
00:43:23,744 --> 00:43:26,444
Sasha, come with me. TC, you look.

606
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:33,669
It's like when he kicked the girl.

607
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,894
Matt, where are you? I want to go! That's it!

608
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:39,419
Ijesztesz us!

609
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:41,644
Cigarettes, cigarette butts look for you!

610
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:45,969
Come on, Matt!

611
00:43:45,994 --> 00:43:47,694
That's bullshit, man!

612
00:43:54,819 --> 00:43:56,519
I want the boy dead.

613
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,744
Matt! Come on, man!

614
00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:11,169
You'll shoot your wife!

615
00:44:11,194 --> 00:44:16,094
It's too late! Damn, man!

616
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:18,119
The hope is that he is dead!

617
00:44:18,144 --> 00:44:24,444
Matt! I'm not playing here with you! Where the hell are you?

618
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:26,169
What the fuck?

619
00:44:44,694 --> 00:44:46,694
Lance! Sasha!

620
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,319
Damn! What happened? What happened?

621
00:44:50,544 --> 00:44:52,444
What? What? No! No!

622
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:54,969
Do You good man?

623
00:44:54,994 --> 00:44:56,994
Raise, raise alone! What?

624
00:44:57,019 --> 00:44:58,719
Raise, raise alone!

625
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:04,219
God, I swear, someone ...

626
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:07,044
Pushed! What?

627
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:08,869
Something hit me bitch!

628
00:45:08,894 --> 00:45:15,194
I looked down the stairs, someone lelökött neck for this reason.

629
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:17,319
Oh my God! I looked back, but no one was there.

630
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:21,444
These things are playing with us. Do you understand? All night. Eldurvultak.

631
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,469
They call, they call it Kenny! What are you waiting for?

632
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:25,394
Very good! Very good!

633
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:27,719
Call Now! Calm down, I'll call!

634
00:45:27,744 --> 00:45:29,644
Oh my God!

635
00:45:29,669 --> 00:45:32,469
Are you okay? Not me!

636
00:45:34,294 --> 00:45:37,094
Shit!

637
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:42,519
I can not get a signal! Test yourself.

638
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:49,544
Perfect.

639
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:50,769
Perfect bitch.

640
00:45:54,994 --> 00:45:57,194
What are you doing, TC?

641
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:59,619
What do you do? Help me.

642
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:02,944
You can not burst the door, TC! Then listen!

643
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:06,969
We can not do any harm. We are responsible.

644
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:08,894
Be patient, wait! A man can not come soon!

645
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:12,319
Come on, what the hell?

646
00:46:12,344 --> 00:46:13,544
This anger is!

647
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:15,469
You think I care? Not at all!

648
00:46:15,494 --> 00:46:16,694
Veszekszünk What the fuck?

649
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:19,619
I'm sick of it, I'm tired. I want to go.

650
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:23,844
I lie down and sleep.

651
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:26,969
You know what? This spectacle of one man.

652
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:28,194
Put the fucking camera.

653
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:28,719
Help!

654
00:46:32,044 --> 00:46:33,344
Help!

655
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:34,569
Very good!

656
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:37,894
Very good!

657
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:40,819
Need Help? No!

658
00:46:40,844 --> 00:46:42,844
Stay there.

659
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,169
Shit, shit. On three, okay?

660
00:46:47,194 --> 00:46:51,594
One, two, three ...

661
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,519
Son of a bitch!

662
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:59,044
Are you printing? Yes! Print.

663
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:03,469
One, two, three ...

664
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:11,194
Me to hell?

665
00:47:12,819 --> 00:47:16,119
No! This is the porch!

666
00:47:16,144 --> 00:47:17,344
This is a fucking porch!

667
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:22,469
Here we came in, right?

668
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:24,894
Yes!
This is the porch!

669
00:47:24,919 --> 00:47:26,119
It does not exist.

670
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,644
That's impossible!

671
00:47:27,669 --> 00:47:31,269
Here we have our shit to you, right?

672
00:47:31,394 --> 00:47:33,394
Here we have them!

673
00:47:33,419 --> 00:47:35,719
There's no sense of this.

674
00:47:38,244 --> 00:47:40,744
There's no sense of this.

675
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:42,969
Here we come in!

676
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:45,294
This is another corridor!
I do not know ...

677
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:49,219
You may have turned somewhere.
Or other of the sides of buildings.

678
00:47:50,644 --> 00:47:52,844
Lance!

679
00:47:58,069 --> 00:47:59,269
Lance!

680
00:48:01,694 --> 00:48:04,094
This is the same door!

681
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:08,619
I've had to be getting out of this guys.

682
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:10,944

683
00:48:10,969 --> 00:48:14,269

691
00:48:45,669 --> 00:48:48,269
Perhaps SAK that this half
Will exit.

692
00:48:48,294 --> 00:48:49,494
To be shut up Shut up.

693
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:50,719
Do not do it.
To be shut up Shut up.

694
00:48:51,144 --> 00:48:53,344
This, you see?

695
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:54,569
Go away.

696
00:48:54,594 --> 00:48:57,294
Leave the man
to perform work.

697
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:00,719
Got it?
Come on!

698
00:49:01,444 --> 00:49:02,744
Would you give a second?

699
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:08,769
Pics!
Trap we fell in!

700
00:49:09,494 --> 00:49:12,594
Look for something to
We can take HIM to grill!

701
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:17,419
What do we ensure, when outside,
lehegesztve go?

702
00:49:17,444 --> 00:49:20,344
It was closed down at you know when?

703
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:22,469
Otlet What a great!

704
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:26,694
There is no obvious
all the window grille.

705
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:30,719
No, no! Of the above!
On those screens were not, right?

706
00:49:30,744 --> 00:49:32,144
We need to find to roof!

707
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,369
Want is what? Jump
Such a height?

708
00:49:34,894 --> 00:49:37,394
Hany Pray go, Sasha?

709
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:38,619
8:44

710
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:39,844
Do not joke with me already!
Pics!

711
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:45,969
I said to kids, that I'll be home!
I have to do tomorrow!

712
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:50,394
Nobody is interested in your problem
Studio to your stupidity.

713
00:49:50,419 --> 00:49:52,119
Guys, let me think
a minute!

714
00:49:52,144 --> 00:49:54,644
That does not make no sense.
Every fucking whore.

715
00:49:54,669 --> 00:49:57,069
Yesterday I went to
when the sun comes up.

716
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,094
You want to say fuck you to me?

717
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:03,819
It should be sunshine
Ora 7:54 OTA.

718
00:50:06,344 --> 00:50:08,644
You always have this.

719
00:50:09,169 --> 00:50:12,369
The sun does not always come.
There's no sense of this.

720
00:50:12,394 --> 00:50:14,294
This is not a fucking joke!

721
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,719
Shut up!

722
00:50:15,744 --> 00:50:16,944
This is nonsense!

723
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:22,369
Help! Please!
Somebody help!

724
00:50:23,694 --> 00:50:30,194
Listen! Let's be rational.
This is a building Regime. Right?

725
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:37,219
So, like a power vessel anomalies
Because of her thoughts are faster to

726
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:42,044
and we feel therefore that I
days should be.

727
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:45,469
This explains, in that there is no sun above.
Kenny also arrived.

728
00:50:45,494 --> 00:50:47,994
Electronic Anomaly. Yes.
This fucking idiot!

729
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:50,919
Point you say that
rationalism think!

730
00:50:50,944 --> 00:50:53,944
Is this your idea? This is not a
sci-fi movie whore!

731
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:56,769
Here there is nothing rationalism!
So rationalism than any more!

732
00:51:23,294 --> 00:51:25,094
I looked to my cell phone.

733
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:30,419
Say 13:12.

734
00:51:31,744 --> 00:51:35,044
13:12 Delut

735
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:41,769
I do not think young.
In be good to have.

736
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:49,994
I do not know. Everyone is very tired.
A little sleep. Break.

737
00:51:51,419 --> 00:51:53,619
Kenny is, I'll wait.

738
00:51:55,944 --> 00:51:59,544
I do not know where to
will meet with us.

739
00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:00,769
There's no sense of this.

740
00:52:04,194 --> 00:52:06,394
Mar 20 Orach not sleep.

741
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,819
I set an alarm to Pray
and a little sleep.

742
00:52:45,044 --> 00:52:46,944
To fuck me?

743
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,069
Houston, for my problem?

744
00:52:51,094 --> 00:52:54,194
What's the matter?
Hell are you doing to me?

745
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,519
Heck Happened to Me?
Eg you young!

746
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:04,844
Someone Or Something
lámpánkat to breaking.

747
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:11,069
I am in total darkness. Torches and cameras are.

748
00:53:11,094 --> 00:53:14,494
At this time wear. I checked my cell phone.

749
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:16,419
At 8 am.

750
00:53:16,644 --> 00:53:19,744
7 hours of sleep. 

751
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:22,269
TC just wanted a sandwich to eat on ...

752
00:53:22,294 --> 00:53:23,894
This should látnotok!

753
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:33,219
Lance! The smell, shut up!

754
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:36,444
What are you doing ... Shut up!

755
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:42,869
All this food, but there are a lot of our water.

756
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,194
I do not know, I think in the fall.

757
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,919
Why not try to go through the tunnel?

758
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:54,144
Kenny said the tunnels connecting the buildings.

759
00:53:54,169 --> 00:53:56,369
Maybe we can find a way out of another building.

760
00:53:56,394 --> 00:53:58,294
Do you see here is a great wall of China?

761
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:02,119
I will not go through the tunnel. When the lights go out, for us.

762
00:54:02,144 --> 00:54:05,144
I remember when they told me the sun?

763
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:10,269
Tûzkijáratot Vi. If we go to the roof, maybe we could climb.

764
00:54:10,394 --> 00:54:15,294
What's the verdict? We will stay or go? I do not care, just go away!

765
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:19,419
I do not want to be here. Everyone! I will!

766
00:54:19,444 --> 00:54:21,444
The roof! Yes! Very good!

767
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:24,569
Let's pack up and go! Come on!

768
00:54:26,494 --> 00:54:29,194
Give a little light, boys! Come on!

769
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,419
To get this?

770
00:54:35,444 --> 00:54:37,544
Lance? Where? No, no, no!

771
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:42,069
You said, you know where. I never said that. I anoint.

772
00:54:42,094 --> 00:54:46,394
You said that you know where the stairs! He said there is a ladder!

773
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:50,919
Therefore, we come from, but anyway! I have seen from the outside!

774
00:54:50,944 --> 00:54:52,144
Very good! Damn!

775
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:55,669
I do I can do it, guys!

776
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,294
What the hell is that?

777
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:02,419
Hello! Is anyone here?

778
00:55:02,944 --> 00:55:04,744
TC! Is that it?

779
00:55:04,845 --> 00:55:07,168
Do not ask a thing already! Stairs or not?

780
00:55:07,293 --> 00:55:08,493
Stay together.

781
00:55:09,618 --> 00:55:13,318
Hey, just világítsatok! Forward, forward!

782
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:16,643
Get away from me sometime! Get away from me sometime!

783
00:55:17,768 --> 00:55:18,968
Wait, guys! Slow down!

784
00:55:18,993 --> 00:55:20,993
What the hell are you?

785
00:55:23,618 --> 00:55:26,518
Yes! Yes! (Output ceiling)

786
00:55:33,343 --> 00:55:34,743
No!

787
00:55:34,768 --> 00:55:37,768
Shut up, shut it! See!

788
00:55:42,493 --> 00:55:45,093
Fucking solid!

789
00:55:45,118 --> 00:55:48,118
It's as if you were there long ago?

790
00:55:48,143 --> 00:55:50,343
It makes no sense!

791
00:55:50,968 --> 00:55:52,868
Damn!

792
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:56,593
To take the camera to my face bitch!

793
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:03,118
What do you think? Not. Not.

794
00:56:14,843 --> 00:56:20,843
We went up the stairs for some time. Was completely closed.

795
00:56:20,868 --> 00:56:25,868
I take everything, because if you go, people want to see this!

796
00:56:28,493 --> 00:56:32,393
Look at this! Here we climbed the stairs, right?

797
00:56:32,418 --> 00:56:34,118
You are in the room.

798
00:56:34,143 --> 00:56:37,743
When we got here, we should at least be here. No?

799
00:56:37,768 --> 00:56:39,468
You think? I do not know!

800
00:56:39,493 --> 00:56:41,293
TC, which ... Lance! Lance!

801
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:42,518
What, what?

802
00:56:43,143 --> 00:56:46,743
Here we are? There should be.

803
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:50,768
This does not mean anything. It says we're the first.

804
00:56:50,793 --> 00:56:54,793
Note that here we are. I know, but ...

805
00:56:55,718 --> 00:57:00,918
TC! Now take this? Yes, I understand.

806
00:57:00,943 --> 00:57:02,843
This is fucked!

807
00:57:03,668 --> 00:57:07,168
Damn! What, what?

808
00:57:07,193 --> 00:57:08,993
What the hell is that? Did you hear that?

809
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:11,318
Can you hear me? What is this?

810
00:57:11,943 --> 00:57:15,243
What is this? Matt? Matt?

811
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:20,068
This is the shit! Matt!

812
00:57:23,793 --> 00:57:26,093
Matt, right?

813
00:57:28,618 --> 00:57:32,018
Guys, let's go back! Matt!

814
00:57:33,043 --> 00:57:35,043
Not here! Not here!

815
00:57:36,568 --> 00:57:38,268
Moved?

816
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:44,793
Let's get outta here!

817
00:58:14,118 --> 00:58:17,018
Every day we try to find a ladder.

818
00:58:19,643 --> 00:58:22,343
Not. Have not been found.

819
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:23,568
This place is a maze of shit.

820
00:58:24,893 --> 00:58:29,093
TC said, as if constantly changing around us.

821
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:34,618
I have not found Matt.

822
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:37,543
I do not know well at all.

823
00:58:37,568 --> 00:58:40,768
We should not have shit.

824
00:58:45,893 --> 00:58:52,193
Fáradtak éhesek és vagyunk.
Egy kicsit aludni Megpróbálunk.

825
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:55,918
Fogunk Váltásban aludni.

826
00:58:56,343 --> 00:58:58,643
Figyelni mindig Valaki fog.

827
00:59:04,968 --> 00:59:07,967
TC! Once again, man? Yes.

828
00:59:10,093 --> 00:59:12,693
We got up at this time. This should látnotok!

829
00:59:12,718 --> 00:59:14,118
Turn the camera off of shit!

830
00:59:14,143 --> 00:59:15,842
Come on, Sasha! Everything you need!

831
00:59:15,867 --> 00:59:17,167
People need to see this!

832
00:59:17,192 --> 00:59:18,392
Beware! Beware!

833
00:59:20,317 --> 00:59:22,817
Sasha, this should be taken into account.

834
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:26,542
Not that anyone came here and did so in silence.

835
00:59:27,467 --> 00:59:29,467
Cut, cut.

836
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:31,692
Matt!

837
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:35,117
I swear I've heard!

838
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:36,342
Matt!

839
00:59:38,067 --> 00:59:39,567
Hello?

840
00:59:39,992 --> 00:59:44,692
See? I told him that I learned! He is alive!

841
00:59:44,717 --> 00:59:46,617
Matt! Are you okay?

842
00:59:47,642 --> 00:59:49,642
Can you hear me?

843
00:59:51,367 --> 00:59:53,367
Frozen!

844
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:02,392
Tell us where you are, the plank!

845
01:00:05,217 --> 01:00:07,017
Maldita sea!

846
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:08,242
That is no longer here.

847
01:00:08,267 --> 01:00:09,767
We need to find.

848
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:12,992
How do we find that still can not find the front door.

849
01:00:13,017 --> 01:00:16,417
It can not be far behind. The speakers are pretty crappy.

850
01:00:18,642 --> 01:00:20,842
Listen! How do you know?

851
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:27,267
Matt! Are you there?

852
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:31,592
Sorry, sorry! Damn!

853
01:00:32,017 --> 01:00:34,717
Matt! We have heard! Where are you? Damn!

854
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:41,042
Sasha, try all the frequencies! You can not very well!

855
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:45,367
What did you say how far it was? I do not know what these descriptions ...

856
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:50,692
So tippelnél? 200-300-400? 200 meters of pure sound.

857
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:52,617
Maybe 300 meters. Let's go further.

858
01:00:52,642 --> 01:00:54,242
After szarakodik, right?

859
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:55,467
Stay together. Come on.

860
01:00:56,392 --> 01:00:58,792
The impasse. Impasse.

861
01:01:06,717 --> 01:01:08,817
Where the hell are you?

862
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:20,842
Guys, this is completely useless.

863
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:23,367
Already found it would be a career ...

864
01:01:23,392 --> 01:01:24,592
Damn!

865
01:01:25,217 --> 01:01:26,117
What was that?

866
01:01:26,142 --> 01:01:27,342
Matt was!

867
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:36,867
What the hell are you doing, buddy?

868
01:01:40,992 --> 01:01:43,092
Lance! Lance!

869
01:01:44,717 --> 01:01:45,917
Damn!

870
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,642
Make hozzáérj!

871
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:56,167
Lance! Lance!

872
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:03,292
Who are you? What are you doing here?

873
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:23,817
Turn off the light! Turn it off!

874
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,442
Have you seen his face? The cheek!

875
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:28,667
Shut up!

876
01:02:28,692 --> 01:02:29,892
Have you seen his face?

877
01:02:37,617 --> 01:02:40,518
Why does this happen? Oh my God!

878
01:02:44,342 --> 01:02:47,442
Damn! Damn!

879
01:02:47,467 --> 01:02:51,567
We're doomed! We lost our Houston-t!

880
01:02:53,592 --> 01:02:55,092
Matt!

881
01:03:01,517 --> 01:03:03,617
Guys!

882
01:03:03,642 --> 01:03:04,842
Guys!

883
01:03:08,467 --> 01:03:10,067
Sasha!

884
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:21,692
TC!

885
01:03:25,017 --> 01:03:26,617
Lance!

886
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:04,942
Is anyone here?

887
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:34,567
Help! Guys!

888
01:05:01,392 --> 01:05:03,292
Even a few hours we're here.

889
01:05:05,517 --> 01:05:06,817
Houston is gone.

890
01:05:08,642 --> 01:05:12,442
Matt wanted to get on the radio, but not responding.

891
01:05:14,767 --> 01:05:16,367
What the hell is that?

892
01:05:17,592 --> 01:05:21,092
These crazy shit happening around us. Damn!

893
01:05:24,517 --> 01:05:26,717
I do not know how long you can get.

894
01:05:30,342 --> 01:05:32,542
We are not alone.

895
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,667
My name is on the bitch!

896
01:05:40,692 --> 01:05:44,292
How the hell my name on it? Damn!

897
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:48,817
First szétkarmolják my back. So ...

898
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:52,242
What the hell is that?

899
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:55,367
When we awoke, the doll was for.

900
01:05:55,392 --> 01:05:56,292
Fuck!

901
01:05:58,117 --> 01:06:03,317
What the hell cheated you out of there? I did not want!

902
01:06:03,342 --> 01:06:06,042
What the hell are you here? I did not want!

903
01:06:06,067 --> 01:06:08,067
That's it! That asshole!

904
01:06:08,092 --> 01:06:11,192
What does that mean? The fact that we're screwed!

905
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,417
Do you understand? That's what!

906
01:06:13,342 --> 01:06:15,042
This is crazy!

907
01:06:15,067 --> 01:06:16,967
This is a crazy bitch!

908
01:06:39,192 --> 01:06:42,692
Do not look! It's not like me!

909
01:06:47,517 --> 01:06:49,117
What the fuck?

910
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,642
There is something! What the fuck?

911
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:03,167
Enough!

912
01:07:03,192 --> 01:07:05,292
As if we could turn around.

913
01:07:09,017 --> 01:07:12,217
Still I can not find Matt and Houston.

914
01:07:12,242 --> 01:07:15,242
Will you stop? What do you mean? What?

915
01:07:15,267 --> 01:07:17,267
Are you kidding? This show.

916
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:19,692
I do not do a show! I just ...

917
01:07:19,717 --> 01:07:22,717
You just things, right? People want to see this!

918
01:07:22,742 --> 01:07:28,642
Matt Houston and disappeared. You have to leave here

919
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:29,767
and find them.

920
01:07:30,192 --> 01:07:33,992
You're just doing this shit.

921
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:35,717
Okay, guys. Relax a little.

922
01:07:36,742 --> 01:07:37,542
I just ...

923
01:07:39,367 --> 01:07:40,967
Let the hell out of here!

924
01:07:46,692 --> 01:07:50,692
You can run so fast? Come on! What the hell are you?

925
01:07:50,717 --> 01:07:52,817
Oh my God! Come, come!

926
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:54,742
No, no, no, no! Arise!

927
01:07:54,767 --> 01:07:56,467
Of your mind? Arise!

928
01:07:56,992 --> 01:07:58,692
Arise!

929
01:08:01,217 --> 01:08:03,817
I can not. I can not. But, you know? I know!

930
01:08:03,842 --> 01:08:07,842
Arise! Arise! I know, I know!

931
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:10,667
Recover yourself! You need to do.

932
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:13,492
Here we go.

933
01:08:14,617 --> 01:08:17,417
Bloody hell! What is it? What is it?

934
01:08:17,442 --> 01:08:19,342
I found something! Come here!

935
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:22,467
What the hell are you waiting for? Come here!

936
01:08:22,492 --> 01:08:23,592
Look!

937
01:08:25,717 --> 01:08:28,717
Matt? What is it? I do not know, man!

938
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:34,442
Matt, you have to!

939
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:38,567
Near the room shit.

940
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:51,292
Dude! Do not mess with you! Matt, are you okay?

941
01:08:52,217 --> 01:08:52,917
Damn!

942
01:08:54,442 --> 01:08:59,342
As the patient has any fóbiája childhood.

943
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:01,667
Matt! Oh my God!

944
01:09:04,192 --> 01:09:06,492
Arise! Come, come!

945
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,017
Come on, wake up!

946
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:11,542
Take it back!

947
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,767
Come, come! Here, here!

948
01:09:13,892 --> 01:09:15,092
Come on!

949
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:19,717
Put him in bed. Left him there.

950
01:09:19,742 --> 01:09:22,042
Do you see anything? No! Very good!

951
01:09:24,667 --> 01:09:27,667
Where were you? Where did you get the bracelet?

952
01:09:29,492 --> 01:09:33,692
Damn, talk to us! Look at your wrist!

953
01:09:33,717 --> 01:09:34,917
Matt? Matt?

954
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:41,042
How did you get so many injuries?

955
01:09:44,067 --> 01:09:48,567
Matt! What did they do to you? What did you see?

956
01:09:50,192 --> 01:09:53,092
Had enough of this. She needs to know where the exit is!

957
01:09:56,317 --> 01:10:01,017
Of course that is out as well! We can go! As we will be better!

958
01:10:01,242 --> 01:10:04,142
What? What do you mean, when we will be better?

959
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,967
What the hell does that mean?

960
01:10:07,692 --> 01:10:09,692
I was not ready yet.

961
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:13,617
The process is slow. But the patient's response to treatment!

962
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:17,642
As your mind! Minh would be stoned! Talk about stupid things!

963
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:20,167
TC! Shut up! They say that close in.

964
01:10:23,092 --> 01:10:25,992
Do not be sad, everything is fine.

965
01:10:32,017 --> 01:10:34,217
It will help you too!

966
01:10:40,642 --> 01:10:42,042
Oh my God!

967
01:10:43,767 --> 01:10:46,267
TC! Look at the door! You have already!

968
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:47,492
Look!

969
01:10:47,517 --> 01:10:51,717
If anything is here! See if you can not get anything!

970
01:11:00,242 --> 01:11:02,442
It is Matt!

971
01:11:04,067 --> 01:11:06,167
Meghülyült.

972
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:19,792
TC is still here with us!

973
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,617
What is it?

974
01:11:21,642 --> 01:11:25,042
All is well. What are you doing?

975
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:41,767
I do not feel well.

976
01:11:43,492 --> 01:11:45,292
I think there is something wrong with me.

977
01:11:53,317 --> 01:11:56,617
Yes, a little gay. I think I have a fever.

978
01:12:01,242 --> 01:12:03,242
Here, drink. Thank you.

979
01:12:03,267 --> 01:12:05,467
Sleep. I can not sleep.

980
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,692
I've never been able to sleep.

981
01:12:18,617 --> 01:12:20,517
What the hell is that?

982
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:21,742
Jesus!

983
01:12:28,867 --> 01:12:31,367
Come, come!

984
01:12:36,192 --> 01:12:38,992
Go! Go!

985
01:12:39,717 --> 01:12:41,417
Quick, here!

986
01:13:13,142 --> 01:13:15,642
Do you see anything? What is it?

987
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:19,467
There is blood in the bathtub! There is blood in the bathtub!

988
01:13:19,492 --> 01:13:21,592
What? Come on!

989
01:13:21,617 --> 01:13:23,417
Where to go? Come, come!

990
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:29,542
What the fuck?

991
01:13:32,567 --> 01:13:33,867
Matt? Matt?

992
01:13:33,892 --> 01:13:36,392
What the hell are you doing? TC! Bring your kádtól!

993
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:38,017
Come here! Matt!

994
01:13:38,042 --> 01:13:39,942
TC! What the hell are you doing?

995
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,167
Damn, I can not!

996
01:13:46,092 --> 01:13:48,292
Oh my God! Oh my God!

997
01:13:49,817 --> 01:13:51,517
Help, help!

998
01:13:51,942 --> 01:13:53,642
Decide!

999
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,767
He's gone!

1000
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:05,392
He's gone!

1001
01:14:06,017 --> 01:14:07,817
Fucking gone!

1002
01:14:08,242 --> 01:14:10,342
Suddenly he was gone! Without a Trace!

1003
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:24,767
Damn! No! No!

1004
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:32,892
This is an elevator!

1005
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:35,317
Open up! Open up!

1006
01:15:35,542 --> 01:15:37,142
Open up! Open up!

1007
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:44,267
This is the elevator shaft.

1008
01:15:44,792 --> 01:15:48,292
If we go through the tunnel, I could go to a different building.

1009
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:56,617
Come on!

1010
01:15:56,842 --> 01:15:58,342
Damn! Damn!

1011
01:15:59,967 --> 01:16:05,967
Listen! Be careful Matt. I'm looking for some tools.

1012
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:09,092
Stay here, hurry!

1013
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:49,917
What the hell is that?

1014
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,842
Jesus! In a language? Damn!

1015
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:17,667
What? What? What is happening here?

1016
01:17:24,392 --> 01:17:25,892
The light! Go for it! Come on!

1017
01:17:28,717 --> 01:17:31,617
Here is a ladder. This will go down.

1018
01:17:32,842 --> 01:17:34,242
How can we take mate?

1019
01:17:34,267 --> 01:17:36,967
I'll go ahead and then transfer. No?

1020
01:17:41,092 --> 01:17:43,392
Back! Stay!

1021
01:17:44,217 --> 01:17:46,017
Lance! Lance!

1022
01:17:54,642 --> 01:17:56,442
Where is the button?

1023
01:17:57,767 --> 01:17:58,967
Here it is!

1024
01:18:46,892 --> 01:18:48,492
Gone!

1025
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:51,217
I do not know, just gone!

1026
01:18:52,242 --> 01:18:54,742
Well! Well! But I come back!

1027
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,167
Where the hell are you? Matt?

1028
01:19:04,092 --> 01:19:06,192
Jesus! He jumped! He jumped!

1029
01:19:36,417 --> 01:19:37,617
Come on!

1030
01:19:38,142 --> 01:19:39,942
Relax! Gotcha!

1031
01:19:46,267 --> 01:19:48,667
There is nothing wrong. There is nothing wrong.

1032
01:20:02,092 --> 01:20:03,392
Here in the tunnel.

1033
01:20:05,117 --> 01:20:07,717
Finally, here we are. Come on!

1034
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:11,342
I can not. I can not go.

1035
01:20:11,367 --> 01:20:13,167
Come on, Sasha! Out!

1036
01:20:13,192 --> 01:20:15,792
Kenny said they are linked to the buildings!

1037
01:20:16,517 --> 01:20:17,917
To do this to me!

1038
01:20:18,142 --> 01:20:20,042
Only I do not know! Very good! No?

1039
01:20:25,867 --> 01:20:28,367
Stay close! Let's do it!

1040
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,592
It should not be too far!

1041
01:20:39,817 --> 01:20:41,117
We are close!

1042
01:20:47,942 --> 01:20:52,142
No! No! Have already been érnünk!

1043
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:56,567
Here must have been! What the fuck!

1044
01:21:02,192 --> 01:21:03,892
I can not go!

1045
01:21:06,017 --> 01:21:07,617
Wait a minute!

1046
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:33,542
I want my mommy!

1047
01:21:51,967 --> 01:21:53,467
What kind of day ...

1048
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:55,992
What day is today?

1049
01:21:59,617 --> 01:22:02,617
I do not know what day it is.

1050
01:22:03,142 --> 01:22:07,842
Throughout the day, going in one direction, but can not get anywhere.

1051
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:11,867
My leg really hurts now.

1052
01:22:11,892 --> 01:22:17,292
They will not succeed. Can not be waived.

1053
01:22:21,617 --> 01:22:23,317
Who's there?

1054
01:22:24,242 --> 01:22:25,942
Who is it?

1055
01:23:26,967 --> 01:23:28,767
Sasha?

1056
01:23:38,892 --> 01:23:40,492
Sasha, where are you?

1057
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:41,517
Where are you?

1058
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:08,942
Damn!

1059
01:24:16,467 --> 01:24:18,667
What?

1060
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,492
"What?"

1061
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:51,817
Slowly running out of battery.

1062
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:57,342
You can only turn on the lights if necessary.

1063
01:24:59,267 --> 01:25:01,567
But I do not need more light.

1064
01:25:04,592 --> 01:25:06,692
Just go ahead.

1065
01:25:08,817 --> 01:25:11,017
I could go on for hours.

1066
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:14,842
It's like a game.

1067
01:25:21,967 --> 01:25:23,767
How far can you go?

1068
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:27,492
If someone watches.

1069
01:25:29,217 --> 01:25:30,417
Fuck!

1070
01:25:34,742 --> 01:25:35,942

01:25:36,767 --> 01:25:38,367

01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:47,842
You hear nothing?

1075
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:53,767

Do not know much room Time, But ...

1078
01:27:05,742 --> 01:27:07,642
There is a door!

1079
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:09,867
Look!

1080
01:27:57,992 --> 01:27:59,792
Eston services can not!

1081
01:28:01,917 --> 01:28:03,317
Eston services can not!

1082
01:28:06,442 --> 01:28:08,342
Total Mind Encantada!

1083
01:29:12,967 --> 01:29:14,667

That's impossible!

1085
01:29:58,317 --> 01:30:01,017
No! I am not happy!

1086
01:30:01,042 --> 01:30:04,942
I'm not crazy! No! No! No!

1087
01:30:16,867 --> 01:30:19,267
All Best plupart Mars.

1088
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,792
Finally I can go home.

1089
01:30:27,917 --> 01:30:34,017
Siri Meetings. Lance Preston.

1090
01:30:36,142 --> 01:30:39,642
