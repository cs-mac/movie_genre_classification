1
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,053
Legend has it that it was written
by the Dark Ones.

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,138
'Necronomicon Ex Mortes'.

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,652
Roughly translated,
'Book of the Dead'.

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:34,256
The book served as a passageway
to the evil worlds beyond.

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,450
lt was written long ago, -

6
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,414
- when the seas ran red with blood.

7
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,898
This blood was used to ink the book.

8
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,737
ln the year 1300 A.D.
the book disappeared.

9
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,372
EVIL DEAD II

10
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,450
- So, what's this pIace Iike?
- It's a IittIe rundown, but...

11
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,211
- It's right up in the mountains.
- Are you sure it's converted?

12
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,854
I think so.

13
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,532
What do you think, kid?

14
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,612
I Iove it, Ash.

15
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,816
I feeI funny about being here.
What if the owners come home?

16
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,219
- We'II teII them the car broke down.
- With your car, they'd beIieve it.

17
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,610
What about some champagne, baby?

18
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:04,055
After aII, I'm a man and you're
a woman. At Ieast, the Iast time.

19
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,737
- There's a tape recorder here.
- See what's on it.

20
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,572
This is Professor Raymond Knowby,
log entry number two.

21
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,096
l believe l made a signifiicant find
in the castle of Kandar.

22
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:48,092
Having journeyed there with my wife,
my daughter and Prof. Gatly, -

23
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,772
- it was in the rear chamber that we
stumbled upon something remarkable.

24
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,532
'Naturum de Monto',
the Book of the Dead.

25
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,858
We brought the book here,
where l could study it undisturbed.

26
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:15,694
Here l began the translations. The
book speaks of a spiritual presence.

27
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,338
A thing of evil that
roams the forests.

28
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:28,376
Through recitation of the book,
this spirit is given license -

29
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,936
- to possess the living.

30
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,493
Here are the pronunciations
of those passages.

31
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,179
Kanda. Estrata. Amantos...

32
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,297
Linda?

33
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,693
Linda...

34
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,137
They're gone.

35
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,730
The sun's driven them away.

36
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,615
For now...

37
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,257
Better puII out of here
before nightfaII.

38
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,936
Join us!

39
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,937
Oh, my God!

40
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,573
I gotta get a grip on myseIf here.

41
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,015
Thank you.

42
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,212
Annie!
How did the expedition go?

43
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,335
Great. I found the pages
of the Book of the Dead.

44
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,374
- What condition are they in?
- Take a Iook.

45
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,574
They haven't aged in 3,000 years.
When do we begin transIations?

46
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,534
Tonight. Is it aII set with my father?

47
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,370
I haven't spoken with him in a week.
There's no phone in the cabin.

48
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,936
It'II take an hour to get there.

49
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,452
You hinted that your father was
onto something with his transIation.

50
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,255
- What has he found?
- ProbabIy nothing.

51
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,658
But just possibIy,
the doorway to another worId.

52
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,696
You tricked me.

53
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,613
Yeah, just...

54
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,969
HeIIo, Iover.

55
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,248
Work shed.

56
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,856
Even now we have
your darIing Linda's souI, -

57
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,257
- she suffers in torment.

58
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,896
You're going down.

59
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,056
Chainsaw.

60
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,739
PIease, Ash.
PIease, don't hurt me.

61
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,651
You swore that we'd aIways
be together. I Iove you.

62
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,459
Yes! Your Iove was a Iie.
And now she burns in heII.

63
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,934
I'm fine...

64
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,256
I'm fine.

65
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,815
I don't think so. We just cut up
our girIfriend with a chainsaw.

66
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,298
Does that sound fine?

67
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,939
You bastards!

68
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,973
You dirty bastards!

69
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,215
Give me back my hand.

70
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,017
Give me back my hand!

71
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,978
Excuse me.

72
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,293
Excuse me...
Is this the road to the Knowby cabin?

73
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,971
- That's right. And you ain't going.
- And why not?

74
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,177
There must be another way in.
A road or something.

75
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,690
Sure ain't no road.

76
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,329
Why the heII
do you want to go there?

77
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,810
None of your business.

78
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,891
I just remembered...
There is a traiI.

79
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,537
- You couId foIIow Bobby Joe and me.
- Sounds aII right.

80
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,528
- But it'II cost you.
- How much?

81
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,699
45... A hundred bucks.

82
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,498
TeII you what: You take my bags
and you got a deaI.

83
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,013
Sure!

84
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:00,209
That's right.
Who's Iaughing now?

85
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,616
Who's Iaughing now?

86
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:01,295
Jesus Christ. I thought she was
taIking about them IittIe bags.

87
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,775
Here's your new home.

88
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,776
You son of a...

89
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,294
Gotcha, didn't I, you IittIe sucker?

90
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,856
I'II bIow your butts to Kingdom Come!

91
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,575
See if we don't...

92
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,539
- Hit him!
- You dirty bastard.

93
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,768
- You gonna be aII right, honey?
- I don't know. I think so.

94
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,849
Sit stiII for a minute.
You know this son of a bitch?

95
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:08,329
- We thought our father wouId be here.
- Where are my parents?

96
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,053
What the heII did you do to them?

97
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,139
Annie, come here! Come here!

98
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,331
Let's throw him in there.

99
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,289
Crazy buck's gone bIood simpIe.

100
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,697
I am...
I made a mistake.

101
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,375
Wait, wait. No!
I made a mistake.

102
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,970
Damn right, you son of a bitch!

103
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,578
I hope you rot down there.

104
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:22,295
- Oh, shit!
- Everything's gonna be fine.

105
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,051
I'm gonna go fetch the sheriff
and bring him...

106
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,050
I checked aII the rooms.
Your foIks aren't here.

107
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,377
But these are my father's things.

108
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:42,295
lt's been a few hours since l
translated the demon passages -

109
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,651
- from the Book of the Dead.

110
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,853
This is my father's voice.

111
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:55,851
l fear that my wife has become host
to a Kandarian demon.

112
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,572
May God forgive me
for what l have unleashed.

113
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:06,774
Last night,
Henrietta tried to kill me.

114
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,416
lt's October 1st, 4:33 p.m.

115
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,817
Henrietta is dead.

116
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:22,777
l couldn't dismember her corpse.
l dragged her downstairs -

117
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,416
- and l buried her.

118
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,169
l buried her in the cellar.
God help me, -

119
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,693
- l buried her in the earthen floor
of the fruit cellar.

120
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,934
- What the heII was that?
- Somebody's with him.

121
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:52,090
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Someone's in my fruit ceIIar.

122
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:59,376
- Someone with a fresh souI.
- Let me out!

123
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,698
- There's something down here!
- It's a trick.

124
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,131
- Let him out!
- Move it!

125
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,138
- Open up.
- Come to me.

126
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:15,494
- HeIp!
- Come to sweet Henrietta.

127
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,290
HeIp me, pIease!

128
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,731
I'II swaIIow your souI!

129
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,252
There's something out there.

130
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,577
That witch in the ceIIar
is onIy part of it.

131
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,853
It Iives out in those woods.

132
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,052
In the dark...

133
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,696
Something...

134
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,939
Something that's come back
from the dead.

135
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,371
- Jake, Iet's get out of here!
- We're going, baby...

136
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,538
- Nobody goes untiI dayIight!
- You Iisten to me...

137
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,449
Hush, little baby
don't say a word

138
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,494
Momma's gonna buy you
a mocking bird

139
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:45,449
If that mocking bird don't sing
Momma will buy you a diamond ring

140
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,892
If that diamond ring turns brass

141
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,537
Momma's gonna buy you
a looking glass

142
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,133
Remember that song, Annie?
I used to sing it to you.

143
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:05,050
- Mother?
- UnIock these chains. QuickIy.

144
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:20,014
- No.
- You were born September 2nd, 1962.

145
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,498
I remember it weII
because it was snowing.

146
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:30,457
So strange it wouId be snowing
in September.

147
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,495
That thing in the ceIIar
is not my mother.

148
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:48,136
We are the things that were
and shaII be again.

149
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:54,290
Spirits of the Book.
We want what is yours: Life.

150
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,009
- Dead by dawn.
- Dead by dawn...

151
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,498
Dead by dawn...

152
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,533
Let me out!

153
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,610
Where are you going?
HeIp us, you fucking coward!

154
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,091
Set me free.

155
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,619
We Iive! We Iive stiII!

156
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:40,535
- That's funny.
- What?

157
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,656
That traiI we came in here on.
It just ain't there no more.

158
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,533
Like the witches swaIIowed her up.

159
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:20,369
It's so quiet.

160
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,249
What the heII was that?

161
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,580
Maybe something trying
to force its way into our worId.

162
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,257
It's in there.

163
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:47,854
- We'II aII go in together.
- HeII, no! You're the curious one.

164
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,057
I'II go with you.

165
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:10,178
Shit! I toId you
there weren't nothing in here.

166
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:39,052
- HoIy mother of mercy.
- Father?

167
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:46,940
There is a dark spirit here
that wants to destroy you.

168
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,974
Your saIvation Iies there.

169
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,168
The pages of the Book...

170
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,408
Recite the passages...
DispeI the eviI.

171
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,499
Save my souI...

172
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,056
And your own...

173
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:31,134
- You're hoIding my hand too tight.
- Baby, I ain't hoIding your hand.

174
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:54,217
Where's Bobby Joe?

175
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:44,135
Hey...
Where the heII is she?

176
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:02,454
- We gotta go out and find her.
- In those woods, forget about her.

177
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,531
What's wrong?

178
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:16,098
Like something just waIked
over my grave.

179
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:21,299
That picture, what is that?

180
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:27,609
In 1300 A.D., they caIIed this man
the 'Hero from the Sky'.

181
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:34,453
- He was prophesied to destroy eviI.
- He didn't do a very good job.

182
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,412
Can you find it?

183
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,499
Here it is. Two passages.

184
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,088
Recitation of this first passage -

185
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:56,489
- wiII make this dark spirit
manifest itseIf in the fIesh.

186
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:02,330
- Why the heII wouId we want that?
- The second passage...

187
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,692
...creates a rift in time and space.

188
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,894
The physicaI manifestation
can be forced back into the rift.

189
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,456
That's the best transIation I can...

190
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,491
That's right...
I'm running the show now.

191
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,569
We're gonna Iook for Bobby Joe,
and then we're getting out of here!

192
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:33,457
No, you idiot! It wiII kiII us aII.

193
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:39,098
She's dead. Don't you understand?
With these pages, -

194
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,771
- at Ieast we have a chance.

195
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,734
Bunch of mumbo-jumbo buIIshit!

196
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,489
These pages don't mean squat!

197
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:04,215
Besides, now you ain't got no choice.
Now move!

198
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,533
Move!
I said 'move'!

199
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:20,971
You stupid fooI!

200
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,897
I'II bIow your fucking head off!

201
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,171
No traiI.
Where to now?

202
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,931
Bobby Joe!

203
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:43,537
- Bobby Joe!
- You'II get us aII kiIIed!

204
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,369
- Leave him aIone!
- Get out of here!

205
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,777
Bobby Joe?
Where are you, girI?

206
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,059
You're ours!

207
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,690
No.

208
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,097
I'm sorry.

209
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,259
Get me in the other room. Get the axe.
We'II kiII him when he comes back.

210
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,817
But first,
puII this damn thing out of me!

211
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:44,698
- I can't breathe. Hurry.
- I'm trying. I'm trying!

212
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:59,573
Shut up! Shut up!

213
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:27,453
Check out... beside the window.

214
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,697
Check the windows,
he's probabIy...

215
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:36,175
HeIp me!

216
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,099
Oh, God!

217
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,136
No, wait!

218
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,968
Listen to me!
I'm aII right now.

219
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,217
That thing is gone.

220
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,572
Dammit! I said I was aII right!
Are you Iistening?

221
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:08,377
Do you hear what I'm saying?
I'm aII right!

222
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:19,133
- I'm aII right.
- Okay, maybe you are.

223
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,889
But for how Iong?

224
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:30,417
If we're gonna beat this thing,
we need those pages.

225
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:37,018
Then Iet's head into that ceIIar
and carve ourseIves a witch.

226
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:25,295
Groovy.

227
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,294
Those pages are down there somewhere.

228
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:43,813
The pages, quick!

229
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,658
Nosferatos, KaIamimnon, Kanda!

230
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:04,295
Let's go.

231
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,818
SwaIIow your souI,
I'II swaIIow your souI.

232
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:59,695
Hush little baby
don't say a word

233
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:05,850
Momma's gonna buy you a...
a mocking bird

234
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,849
I'II swaIIow your souI,
I'II swaIIow your souI...

235
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:36,059
SwaIIow this.

236
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:05,175
I onIy compIeted
the first passages!

237
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:09,737
That was to make the eviI
a thing of the fIesh.

238
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:17,218
You didn't finish it?

239
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:21,254
There's stiII the second passage...

240
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:30,137
- The one to send the eviI back.
- Start reciting it! Now!

241
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:45,377
Don't Iook, Annie!
Finish the passages! Get rid of it!

242
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:49,698
Kanda! Amandat!

243
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:33,576
Nosferatos! Amantos! Akadiv!

244
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:02,055
- We've won!
- Victory is ours!

245
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,939
Kanda...

246
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:39,734
You did it, kid. By God...

247
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:14,655
For God's sake...
How do you stop it?

248
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:24,819
SIay the beast.
'Tis a deadite.

249
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:34,214
Run for the castIe!

250
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:13,217
HaiI he who has come from the skies
to deIiver us from the deadites!

251
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:24,129
No! No!
