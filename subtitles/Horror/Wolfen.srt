1
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:28,584
Ten, nine...

2
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:31,044
...eight, seven...

3
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:33,382
...six, five...

4
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,527
...four...

5
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:36,740
...three, two...

6
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,024
...one!

7
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,363
Here goes.

8
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:33,175
Bravo, Mr. Van der Veer!

9
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:59,094
- Yes, Mr. Van der Veer?
- We'll go to the penthouse.

10
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,540
Stop by Battery Park.

11
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:25,524
Roger, routing change.
Penthouse, ETA: 0615.

12
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,758
What will Van der Veer do
at the Battery at 6:00 a.m.?

13
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:31,062
- Visit his ancestors.
- Whatever he wants.

14
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,283
Roger, Manhattan arrival.
All clear, Romulus.

15
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,034
You've got sector five read-out on three.

16
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,160
Chris?

17
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,347
Darling?

18
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,799
Chris!

19
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,748
Chris!

20
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:43,286
You scared me!

21
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:50,967
Darling!

22
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,353
- Did you miss me?
- Yes.

23
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:00,667
Pauline!

24
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:15,794
Forget it, kid.

25
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:18,838
Oh, good. Put him on.

26
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,651
Good morning, it's Warren.
We got a problem.

27
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,542
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

28
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,970
Well, there's a nightmare
down in the Battery.

29
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:29,675
Three bodies.
Mutilation, possible sexual assault...

30
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,017
...some dismemberment.
Maybe even cannibalism.

31
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:33,841
I'd love to see it, but I've...

32
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,010
I'm late for Mass
and I got a heavy golf date.

33
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:39,434
Oh, you'll see it, Dewey.

34
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:43,786
It's very weird and it's very strange,
just like you. So, it's back to work.

35
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:46,314
- I'm leaving now. Are you in Staten Island?
- Yeah.

36
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:48,776
- Get your ass over there as fast as you can.
- How?

37
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:49,800
Fly!

38
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,399
- How are you?
- Fine.

39
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:29,986
Food.

40
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:45,794
- How can you eat that crap?
- It settles my stomach.

41
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:49,834
Well?

42
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:52,838
Nothing. I didn't find anything aft, either.

43
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:04,191
So?

44
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:05,760
So, what?

45
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,309
So, who got killed? The governor?

46
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:13,540
Somebody bigger.
Christopher Van der Veer.

47
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,252
Megabucks.

48
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:19,747
Heir to the fortune,
maybe even the presidency.

49
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,048
So much for heirs.

50
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,827
His bodyguard. His wife is over there.

51
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:32,831
- Witnesses?
- lf seagulls could talk, sure.

52
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,674
- Kidnapping?
- No sign of a struggle.

53
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:40,350
Take a look around.
See if you can sniff out anything.

54
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:45,208
Does this mean I'm back on the job?

55
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:49,274
- You're a detective, aren't you?
- I'll try and remember that.

56
00:13:50,274 --> 00:13:53,089
- It's a good thing to happen on a Sunday.
- How long...

57
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:54,561
Oh, Christ!

58
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:57,120
- Let me handle this.
- I always do.

59
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,364
Commissioner. Mr. Mayor.

60
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:07,674
You handled that nicely.

61
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:20,507
This is just wonderful!
God knows what's next.

62
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:23,767
- Where's the damn coroner?
- We haven't located him yet.

63
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:26,423
I want him here!
Van der Veer was my friend.

64
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:28,728
You've got your best man here already.

65
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:31,634
Any more film, John?

66
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,088
Warren, what the hell happened?

67
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,537
It wasn't robbery.
Their money and jewelry weren't touched.

68
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:41,178
There was some cocaine.

69
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:45,367
Party favors. But more than that...

70
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:49,078
Two factors have the potential
to make this international, Mr. Mayor.

71
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,218
Executions and terrorism.

72
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:55,540
Makes a bombing seem like child's play.

73
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:56,689
Excuse me.

74
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,599
Dewey Wilson?

75
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:02,672
Homicide, kidnapping and results.
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

76
00:15:02,744 --> 00:15:05,646
Jonathan Ross,
Bureau Chief of Executive Security.

77
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,818
His firm's responsible for some
of the top executives in the world.

78
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:10,131
They have resources we don't have.

79
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,906
No matter how sophisticated
technology gets, there's no guarantee.

80
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,066
God, it stinks down here.

81
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:24,786
Severely inflicted wounds...

82
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,752
Dew! The old jogging trip?

83
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:37,258
The six month's annual bionic,
shed-the-twenty-pounds marathon resolve.

84
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,729
Sound mind, sound body.

85
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,505
You got to get into chemicals.
They keep you going.

86
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,759
Your body'll malfunction on you
one way or another.

87
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,263
Yeah. Tell me about it.

88
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:51,370
Wanna peek?

89
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:54,702
Something to tell
your grandchildren about.

90
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:58,886
Took his brain. What the hell
do you suppose they did with it?

91
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,967
Maybe they dribbled it down Wall Street.

92
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,723
I got a hand in a baggie.

93
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:09,603
It belongs to that guy over there.
Had a gun in it.

94
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:14,214
SR says he didn't even get a shot off.
How's that for fast?

95
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:16,362
Fraternity ring?

96
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,527
Pentagram and a goat. Voodoo.

97
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:21,217
Yeah?

98
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:47,911
Now, ain't this a shame?

99
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,978
Bizarre, man. It almost severed her head.

100
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,003
- It was instantaneous?
- Instantaneous?

101
00:16:56,968 --> 00:16:59,521
You seen a chicken run around
with its head cut off?

102
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:02,622
Hey, nobody ever thinks about the head.

103
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:06,338
During the French Revolution,
when they chopped heads off...

104
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:09,440
...they'd pick them out the basket
and look them in the face.

105
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,517
Most went out right away, in shock.

106
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,459
Every fifth head or so was alive.
Wide awake...

107
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,892
...eyes blinking,
mouth trying to say something.

108
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:19,001
Yeah, sure.

109
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:21,791
The brain can live without oxygen
for more than a minute.

110
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,387
That's a long time, buddy boy.

111
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,110
How'd you like to see your own body
and know you're dead?

112
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:28,922
Give me a nice death in bed.

113
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:31,840
Preferably with a partner.

114
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,447
You can take her away now.

115
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:43,863
Hey, careful with her...

116
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:46,389
...head.

117
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:36,434
Well, let's see what happened to my man.

118
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:40,374
Two bullet holes upside the head!

119
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,398
See! You shouldn't have been fucking
with that bitch.

120
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,029
You going to push, man?
I'm working by myself today, right?

121
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,109
Ain't nobody working but me. Shit!

122
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,341
- Another hot Saturday night.
- I heard that.

123
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,878
- What's today's special?
- Tennis shoes and jock straps.

124
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:08,333
A lot of joggers are going out of business.

125
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:10,734
You check out that dude yet?

126
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:17,385
Dew!

127
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:22,192
Weird shit happening here, man.
Give us a few more minutes.

128
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:25,739
How's it going, Captain?

129
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,135
Why do I always have to get
the hard ones?

130
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:30,627
There's nothing there.
There's nothing there!

131
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:34,272
Hey, Dew!

132
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,397
The Chief will tell him what we got.
Severance of the jugular and carotids...

133
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,154
...destruction of the esophagus.

134
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:43,712
Lethal trauma on the throats,
resulting in...

135
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,336
But what's really interesting
is what we haven't got.

136
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:56,220
There's not a trace of metal.

137
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:03,169
You know how every piece of metal,
no matter how sharp or smooth...

138
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,179
...will leave a residue when it cuts.

139
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:08,705
It could be as finite as dust.
Soft x-ray should pick it up.

140
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:13,280
Nothing!

141
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:18,238
And nothing softer could have ripped
and ravaged like this.

142
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:22,936
Some plastic weapon?

143
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:26,302
Synthetics.

144
00:21:28,737 --> 00:21:31,126
I don't think there's any way
I could check that.

145
00:21:36,352 --> 00:21:39,515
You know, Dew, you could use a haircut.
Want to lie down?

146
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,106
Not till it's my turn.

147
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,547
How's it going?

148
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:53,493
Identification?

149
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:57,436
- My face.
- I need credentials.

150
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,467
All that separates you from a guard dog
is a brain.

151
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:04,633
All right, Captain.

152
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:07,224
Good dog!

153
00:22:08,156 --> 00:22:10,457
- Hey, Dewey. What's happening?
- Hi, Captain.

154
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:15,895
- What's this?
- ME's report.

155
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:17,784
Oh, yeah? What's with the morgue?

156
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:20,463
No answers to a lot of questions.

157
00:22:25,082 --> 00:22:26,707
- Is that it?
- That's it.

158
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,694
What's the matter with you? You bored?

159
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:31,313
I'm thinking.
You're just not used to the expression.

160
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,248
Dungeman? Did you find out
what they were doing there?

161
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,069
Anniversary party
with 100 of their closest friends.

162
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:39,858
We know! We're checking the guest list.

163
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,650
Big party at the family compound.

164
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:44,565
It breaks up at 5:00 a.m.
They head back to their penthouse.

165
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:46,870
A little pearl gift...

166
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,503
...a little booze, a little drugs.
They decide to boogie.

167
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:54,346
They were married there.

168
00:22:55,797 --> 00:22:57,520
- How do you know that?
- I asked.

169
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,798
- You really are thinking.
- It's better than the Sunday crossword.

170
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:03,762
Maybe.

171
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:07,978
- Any Jack the Rippers out there?
- No psychos missing from the loony bins.

172
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:11,084
If it is the Ripper,
the ME can't find a trace of any weapon.

173
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,135
What?

174
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:13,739
Who knows?

175
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,095
The Filipinos remove organs
with their hands.

176
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:20,586
- That driver was a Haitian, right?
- Yeah.

177
00:23:21,297 --> 00:23:23,566
One tough son of a bitch.
Worth three normals.

178
00:23:23,761 --> 00:23:26,346
Ex-Papa Doc Secret Police.
Ton Ton Macoute.

179
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,286
Van der Veer had
a big liquor import business in the islands.

180
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,781
How that Haitian gets jumped
beats the shit out of me.

181
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:33,132
You check the voodoo angle?

182
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,882
Voodoo? There's 80 goddamn sects
in Manhattan alone.

183
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:38,917
Come here, I want to show you something.
The meat and potatoes.

184
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,152
- Business and political enemies.
- Fuchek, what do you got?

185
00:23:42,894 --> 00:23:46,057
Business enemies he ain't got.
Just one big corporate family.

186
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,514
Political, well, there's the action.

187
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:51,362
The family's got interests
on every continent.

188
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:53,511
Funding a government overthrow.

189
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:56,487
Putting a mine in some holy ground.
Moving a town.

190
00:23:56,556 --> 00:23:58,443
A real friend of the Third World.

191
00:23:58,668 --> 00:24:00,009
International terrorism, huh?

192
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:12,162
- You got quadrant four secured already?
- Yes, I do.

193
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:22,496
- Punch me up 20 on this.
- Roger, 20.

194
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:24,574
Got a demo run faction.

195
00:24:24,648 --> 00:24:27,365
File facts negative so far.
Unknown radical connections.

196
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:30,624
Wait, wait. Give me the stats on 20.

197
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:35,139
- Well, hello! That's Van der Veer's niece.
- Have the police pick her up.

198
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,234
Give me 20.

199
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:54,589
Somewhere in the world, every other day...

200
00:24:54,852 --> 00:24:58,364
...a corporate executive is kidnapped
or assassinated...

201
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:00,920
...netting ransoms in excess of $1 billion...

202
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:04,988
...and forcing the expenditure of $50 million
in corporate security measures.

203
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:10,142
Transnational terrorism would rival
their victims in profit if you guys...

204
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,453
I want her.

205
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:15,994
...sophisticated Joseph Richmond, central
chemical plant manager in Columbia.

206
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,590
Yeah?

207
00:25:17,857 --> 00:25:18,805
Good morning.

208
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,051
Hi! Good morning. Come in. Sit down.

209
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,272
I was reading the response you got
on that Psychology of Violence report.

210
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:27,383
- That must be very gratifying.
- Yes, it is.

211
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:28,404
Good.

212
00:25:29,055 --> 00:25:31,804
I'm teaming you up with Dewey Wilson
on the Van der Veer case.

213
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,219
I didn't know he was back.
I thought he retired. Disabled. Mental?

214
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,539
He had a lot of family problems.
He started to drink a little too much. He...

215
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:44,052
Police work piled up on him.
He's a good man. You'll like him.

216
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:45,818
Okay, fine.

217
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:49,689
We also had a little break this morning.
Van der Veer's niece was picked up.

218
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:53,496
She's Weather underground.
I want you to chat her up.

219
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:55,985
Put her on your machine.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

220
00:25:57,595 --> 00:26:01,751
So what's new on the international
mutilation front? Run down the list.

221
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,163
Well, kneecappings, Red Brigade, Italy.

222
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,493
Slashed Achilles tendons,
eyes gouged out, ears cut off...

223
00:26:09,594 --> 00:26:10,838
...Red Army faction.

224
00:26:10,906 --> 00:26:14,254
Let's see, PFLP, Carlos,
Baader, Tuperamos...

225
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:16,788
...Fifth Estate, a few decapitations.

226
00:26:17,304 --> 00:26:20,271
The Uno Mondo.
They slash off the male genitalia.

227
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:23,951
The cock and balls.
They stuff them in their victim's mouth.

228
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:31,311
- You ever seen anybody killed?
- Pardon me?

229
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:34,448
Somebody's insides on a wall?
Hold your nose.

230
00:26:37,205 --> 00:26:38,798
So, who collects brains?

231
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:41,902
It's probably a symbol.

232
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:45,993
Miss Rensselaer
probably went to Radcliffe...

233
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:48,330
...and took a course in symbolism.

234
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:52,559
- What is your full name?
- Cicely Marie Rensselaer.

235
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,248
- What city are we in?
- That's a good question.

236
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:59,470
- Well, what city?
- We're in New York, aren't we?

237
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:01,069
We're in New York.

238
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:07,469
What are you watching?

239
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:10,985
She is an urban guerrilla
fighting the just war...

240
00:27:11,217 --> 00:27:13,551
...against all us fascist swine.

241
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:17,446
And she is a chain-jerked...

242
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:22,571
...pussy of an amoral society.
Well, that's what she's just been called.

243
00:27:22,703 --> 00:27:25,484
What is this crap?
Am I on some kind of a lie detector?

244
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,073
You know that would be illegal.

245
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:31,971
Yeah, the whole room's a lie detector.
This is a high-end infrared imager.

246
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:33,958
Well, you were always a good kid...

247
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:37,125
The register's heat changes
in the 8 to 12 micron range.

248
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:41,026
Thermo-graphic systems equipment,
voice analyzers.

249
00:27:42,156 --> 00:27:44,130
Computers and recorders are back there.

250
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,237
Micro-frequency levels
indicate psychological stress.

251
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:50,820
These things should be monitoring
Congress and the White House.

252
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:52,068
Country would grind to a halt.

253
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:55,106
This stuff's all remote. Covert.
You don't hook them up with...

254
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:57,001
...a bandage on the arm and a sweat meter.

255
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:00,742
One death is a tragedy. A million
is a statistic. You tell me about our wars.

256
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,751
Tell me about three deaths.

257
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,110
Three deaths?

258
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:09,724
Well?

259
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,908
She's hiding something.

260
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:25,180
Did you, or anyone you know, participate
in the murder of Christopher Van der Veer?

261
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,004
That's one startled kid.

262
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:32,932
Are you aware of any information...

263
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:36,193
...about the murder
of Christopher and Pauline Van der Veer?

264
00:28:42,883 --> 00:28:44,541
It wasn't a murder, Rebecca.

265
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:47,611
- It wasn't a murder, Rebecca.
- It was an execution.

266
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,885
Jesus Christ!

267
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:51,842
It was an execution.

268
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,668
It wasn't a murder, Rebecca.
It was an execution.

269
00:28:56,898 --> 00:28:59,385
She's lying.
She knows nothing about the murders.

270
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:04,765
Got you. Urban guerilla.
Till your goddamn trust fund runs out.

271
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,644
- You're sure she's lying?
- Absolutely.

272
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:12,922
- Great! Now where does that leave us?
- Like this just didn't happen.

273
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,648
I got to get straight.
What'll you give me for it?

274
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,964
No Hustler pinups!

275
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:59,936
I don't think
this has anything to do with terrorism.

276
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,593
What does it have to do with?

277
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:04,930
- Paranoia.
- Paranoia?

278
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:09,566
Your people want it to be political.
It justifies your existence.

279
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,263
She was a logical suspect.

280
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:13,308
What weapon did that?

281
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:17,635
Why hasn't anybody called the press?
Especially for such a beautiful job.

282
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,147
They all don't right away.

283
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:27,872
You wanna a shot?

284
00:32:29,476 --> 00:32:32,410
- Have you got any ice?
- Only in my heart.

285
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,079
"God, guns and guts...

286
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:49,280
"...made America. Let's keep all three."

287
00:32:50,913 --> 00:32:52,701
Why are you a cop?

288
00:32:53,312 --> 00:32:56,824
Oh, I like to kill. It's a habit
I picked up and it's...

289
00:32:57,472 --> 00:32:58,748
It's hard to shake.

290
00:33:00,863 --> 00:33:02,292
Killed anyone lately?

291
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:06,042
Well, I tried to kill a rabbit this morning,
but it went down a hole.

292
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:08,435
What do you make of that?

293
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:12,058
Well, something sexual, I suppose.

294
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:25,617
Good night, Dewey.

295
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:27,224
Good night, Rebecca.

296
00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:31,507
- Where are you staying?
- A company apartment.

297
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:33,972
Got a ride?

298
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,025
- You asking?
- Yeah.

299
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:37,487
No.

300
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:39,026
You want one?

301
00:33:40,249 --> 00:33:41,493
Not tonight.

302
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:32,040
Stop! Stop!

303
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:39,213
Jesus Christ!

304
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:42,728
Over here! Come over here!

305
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:47,276
- Come on, man, hurry!
- Come on, let's go take a look.

306
00:34:47,344 --> 00:34:49,035
Cesspool! Look at this sewer!

307
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:51,721
Jesus Christ!
Didn't expect that kind of work in here.

308
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,397
How many houses
did the Van der Veers have?

309
00:35:08,461 --> 00:35:11,178
Locust Valley, Long Island, the Bahamas...

310
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:14,244
...Johannesburg, Rome, San Francisco...

311
00:35:14,316 --> 00:35:16,552
...and this little pied-à-terre.

312
00:35:17,644 --> 00:35:19,072
Peter Van der Veer.

313
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:25,641
And old John Joachim, himself.

314
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:30,115
He even looks like God!
Except his hands are in his pockets.

315
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:33,153
They'd better be! He's got
about four dead presidents in them.

316
00:35:44,648 --> 00:35:46,404
Mrs. Van der Veer painted this?

317
00:35:48,072 --> 00:35:51,105
- It's such a disturbing picture!
- It sure disturbs me.

318
00:35:51,335 --> 00:35:53,887
- She was asking for help.
- With her art lessons.

319
00:35:56,742 --> 00:35:58,018
It's not me.

320
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,260
- Got a phone I could use?
- On the desk.

321
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,442
What's this?

322
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:21,533
Mr. Van der Veer's real estate project.
Ground breaking ceremony was Saturday.

323
00:36:21,602 --> 00:36:22,650
- Whittington.
- Dew.

324
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,827
They found some body parts
in the South Bronx.

325
00:36:24,898 --> 00:36:28,443
- What's the South Bronx got to do...
- This is hot, man! Meet me at Baldy's.

326
00:36:28,962 --> 00:36:30,391
I'll be right there.

327
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:35,517
We've got hair files on every race running,
plus your basic sub-flavors.

328
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:38,617
Facial, axillary, chest, pubic.

329
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:41,627
They're all different. All identifiable.

330
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,348
The one on the left came off
the Bronx kidney.

331
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,317
The one on the right was found
on Pauline Van der Veer.

332
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,232
Identical.

333
00:36:52,062 --> 00:36:53,720
A hair is like a fingerprint.

334
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,284
And those two
came from the same source.

335
00:36:57,406 --> 00:36:58,682
What are they?

336
00:36:59,837 --> 00:37:03,317
Captain, they don't match anything I have.
All I know is they ain't human.

337
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:05,209
And in New York?

338
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,503
South Bronx and Wall Street.
What's the connection?

339
00:37:09,756 --> 00:37:10,966
They're both dead.

340
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,170
- Thanks, Baldy.
- Thank you.

341
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,825
- See you, Baldy.
- Keep combing it.

342
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,259
My God!

343
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:14,248
- I haven't been in a church in years.
- Lost your faith?

344
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,872
No. I got married in one.

345
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:19,787
Is he still around?

346
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:21,390
Not anymore.

347
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,777
I was an altar boy once.

348
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:29,989
An old nun ran the show.
Used to beat the shit out of me.

349
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:39,818
- Take a look inside?
- No, thanks.

350
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,142
- What was that?
- What?

351
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,027
That sound! Like a baby!

352
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,063
There! Inside!

353
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:58,977
"The devil on one shoulder,
an angel on the other."

354
00:40:00,995 --> 00:40:03,264
- What?
- Let's get out of here!

355
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:11,455
Did you hear that?

356
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:14,781
Wind.

357
00:43:00,075 --> 00:43:02,791
I haven't been to a place like this
since school.

358
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,061
You really know
how to treat a woman, Wilson.

359
00:43:05,193 --> 00:43:06,720
This isn't a date, Neff.

360
00:43:08,105 --> 00:43:09,567
What do you think it was?

361
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:16,412
Kids.

362
00:43:17,096 --> 00:43:18,044
Junkies.

363
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:21,444
Hallucinations. I don't know.

364
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:34,078
Have you killed anyone?

365
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:37,534
Well, I wounded someone.

366
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:42,298
I shot a rookie in the leg, cleaning my gun
in the locker room second week in uniform.

367
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:46,428
Have you?

368
00:43:47,268 --> 00:43:49,177
Why don't you ask how many?

369
00:45:10,935 --> 00:45:11,884
Thank you.

370
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,499
You sure it wasn't a snake? You know,
New Yorkers just ape-shit about snakes.

371
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:20,405
You see, you don't have to walk them.
Cobras, pythons, boas, rattlers.

372
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:23,067
You got more snakes in the Apple
than in the Amazon.

373
00:48:23,516 --> 00:48:25,850
The Medical Examiner
sends us dozens to identify.

374
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,763
They're coming up out of the toilets,
biting people on the ass.

375
00:48:28,827 --> 00:48:32,275
Course, snakes don't have hairs.
You people got something with hairs.

376
00:48:33,115 --> 00:48:35,122
Yes. Any idea what it is?

377
00:48:35,994 --> 00:48:40,150
It's a carnivore. You got yourself
some kind of meat-eater. A bear.

378
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:41,712
A cat. Something like that.

379
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:46,896
Nature works. We don't.
The basic unit's flawed.

380
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:49,751
Someday, you'll have to blow away
like an ash anyway, right?

381
00:48:49,817 --> 00:48:51,573
Tilt, gone.

382
00:48:52,568 --> 00:48:54,324
Goodbye diet dog food!

383
00:48:56,247 --> 00:48:58,735
The hair on the left
was found in Manhattan.

384
00:48:58,808 --> 00:49:01,044
The hair on the right, in the South Bronx.

385
00:49:01,399 --> 00:49:03,373
- Canis lupus.
- Canis lupus?

386
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:06,067
Yeah. You want to meet him?

387
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:12,844
Wake up, boy. We got friends for lunch.
Come on. Down, boy.

388
00:49:19,284 --> 00:49:21,967
- Those were wolf hairs?
- You bet!

389
00:49:22,036 --> 00:49:23,858
I can't quite place the subspecies.

390
00:49:23,924 --> 00:49:26,128
They were 40-odd, but it's lupine.

391
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:27,721
Any wild around New York?

392
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:32,111
No. I wish. We wiped them out
around the turn of the century in the east.

393
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,496
They went the way of the Indians.
The Genocide Express.

394
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:38,253
There used to be millions.
Now just a few in the Rockies.

395
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:41,039
- What are you trying to pin on the big bad?
- A murder case.

396
00:49:42,033 --> 00:49:43,756
What? A hitman in a fur coat?

397
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:46,086
Hairs were found on the victim.

398
00:49:48,496 --> 00:49:49,990
With all the psychos in New York...

399
00:49:50,064 --> 00:49:52,431
...you're trying to pin this
on an endangered species?

400
00:49:52,496 --> 00:49:54,732
Could a wolf do that?

401
00:49:55,215 --> 00:49:56,328
You're serious?

402
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:02,189
No way. These aren't animal wounds.

403
00:50:02,255 --> 00:50:04,905
- Could you train a wolf?
- Then it wouldn't be a wolf.

404
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:06,568
Absolutely not.

405
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:10,375
People kill people.
Wolves don't kill people. That's a myth.

406
00:50:10,606 --> 00:50:13,158
And they're too smart.
They're like Indians.

407
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:17,825
Wolves and Indians evolved
and were destroyed simultaneously.

408
00:50:18,188 --> 00:50:20,326
Their societies are
practically one and the same.

409
00:50:20,396 --> 00:50:22,403
They're tribal. They look out for their own.

410
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:24,810
They don't overpopulate,
and they're superb hunters.

411
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:31,943
- Do you know anything about NAM?
- As in Viet?

412
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:36,320
As in Native American Movement.
Broken Elbow, Wounded Knee?

413
00:50:36,874 --> 00:50:39,240
Very little.
They haven't been active in our area.

414
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:42,498
I doubt Indians
have anything to do with this.

415
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:44,066
Eddie Holt.

416
00:50:44,424 --> 00:50:46,726
- Who's he?
- The Crazy Horse of the '70s.

417
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:50,399
The only one
of our local militants left alive...

418
00:50:50,471 --> 00:50:53,024
...who's not making money
off of Levi commercials.

419
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:58,109
I arrested him and his friends
before they blew up Federal Hall.

420
00:50:58,662 --> 00:51:00,385
The $24 deed was in there?

421
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,157
He did four years for manslaughter.
Killed an Apple.

422
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,277
What's an Apple?

423
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:08,349
A conservative Indian.
Red on the outside, white inside.

424
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:10,879
He's been out about six months.

425
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,861
Why would he kill Van der Veer?

426
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:16,707
Maybe they want Manhattan back.
Van der Veer owned a hell of a chunk of it.

427
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:18,528
Motivation's your department.

428
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:20,698
- Where is he now?
- On the steel.

429
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:21,889
What's that?

430
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:25,664
High steel. The Indians build
most of the bridges and skyscrapers.

431
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,406
- You're looking for Eddie?
- Yeah.

432
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,825
- He's up there.
- Can you bring him down?

433
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,551
I will. In about four hours.

434
00:51:36,577 --> 00:51:39,130
You want to talk to him? Go on up.

435
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:42,143
You want to wait, the bar's over there.

436
00:51:42,368 --> 00:51:44,757
- Where are the stairs?
- There aren't any.

437
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,433
So you guys do have a head for heights.

438
00:52:36,568 --> 00:52:38,640
Just like we're born alcoholics, huh?

439
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:42,000
You want to be a hero,
you get yourself a hero's job.

440
00:52:42,136 --> 00:52:46,837
- Keeping out of trouble up here, Eddie?
- Best I can. I got a good job and good pay.

441
00:52:47,671 --> 00:52:50,060
Parlez-vous politics on the side?

442
00:52:50,903 --> 00:52:52,113
Politics?

443
00:52:53,398 --> 00:52:55,307
You live in the past as much as I do.

444
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:02,444
Little smoking, little drinking.
That's about it.

445
00:53:05,397 --> 00:53:06,706
You keep in touch?

446
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:10,259
With what?
The guy next door, your mother, what?

447
00:53:10,324 --> 00:53:11,850
- Mother Nature.
- Sure.

448
00:53:12,468 --> 00:53:14,704
I can swim like a fish
and I fuck like a bunny.

449
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:17,832
- I can shift with the best of them.
- Shift?

450
00:53:17,938 --> 00:53:19,913
Shape-shifting. We do it for kicks.

451
00:53:19,986 --> 00:53:22,953
- Oh, yeah?
- Turn ourselves into a different animal.

452
00:53:24,049 --> 00:53:26,864
- One night a salmon, next night a deer.
- Or a wolf?

453
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:31,877
Sure.

454
00:53:38,863 --> 00:53:39,845
Or an eagle.

455
00:53:42,767 --> 00:53:45,963
Come on, Dewey.
Just flap your arms and jump. It's easy.

456
00:53:47,215 --> 00:53:49,603
Go on. It's all in the head.

457
00:53:52,942 --> 00:53:54,251
That'd be murder.

458
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:58,632
- You wouldn't kill anyone else, would you?
- That's what they pay you to find out.

459
00:54:42,566 --> 00:54:43,810
He works for us.

460
00:54:44,678 --> 00:54:47,198
- Eddie Holt works for ESS?
- Indirectly.

461
00:54:48,294 --> 00:54:50,847
He was installing
communication equipment for us.

462
00:54:50,949 --> 00:54:53,764
But what's really interesting
is that he was on the bridge...

463
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:56,065
...when the Van der Veer's crossed
Sunday morning.

464
00:54:56,133 --> 00:55:00,093
He showed up at about 5:00 a.m.,
drunk or stoned...

465
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:01,757
...or maybe it was an act.

466
00:55:02,468 --> 00:55:05,184
Strange bird.
He's always up on those bridges.

467
00:55:05,923 --> 00:55:07,450
The guards thought nothing of it.

468
00:55:07,523 --> 00:55:09,694
They watch him
through night-viewing devices.

469
00:55:10,531 --> 00:55:11,872
He just sits up there.

470
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:13,825
Talking to ancestors.

471
00:55:14,146 --> 00:55:18,815
- He didn't come any nearer to the Battery?
- Not that anybody saw.

472
00:55:20,321 --> 00:55:22,710
Maybe they didn't recognize him.

473
00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:40,022
Don't do that kind of shit, man!

474
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:42,322
So you ghouls do get the creeps
down here.

475
00:56:43,605 --> 00:56:44,947
What's he have to say?

476
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:48,202
No, it's what Ferguson will say.
He's on his way down.

477
00:56:49,045 --> 00:56:51,117
These Bronx parts are mighty interesting.

478
00:56:51,477 --> 00:56:54,324
They come from eight different people,
and each one of them...

479
00:56:54,388 --> 00:56:57,105
Now stand by,
every fucking piece is diseased.

480
00:56:57,555 --> 00:57:00,370
Cirrhotic liver, cancerous lung,
diseased heart...

481
00:57:00,468 --> 00:57:01,612
Hospital garbage.

482
00:57:02,515 --> 00:57:05,548
A heart, liver, you can't live without them.
Why take them out?

483
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:06,862
So, mutilation...

484
00:57:06,994 --> 00:57:10,670
Well, that's what I'm thinking, too,
until Sayad here shows me his card.

485
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:13,768
Look at this.

486
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:16,902
Those faint striation patterns
on his throat...

487
00:57:17,296 --> 00:57:20,395
...and on his wrists, and on those parts.
They're all identical.

488
00:57:20,848 --> 00:57:22,092
They're all alike.

489
00:57:22,288 --> 00:57:23,466
Not cuts.

490
00:57:24,336 --> 00:57:25,383
Tears.

491
00:57:26,447 --> 00:57:28,618
- You mean, like teeth?
- Very sharp teeth.

492
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:34,027
Something out there
might be eating people.

493
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:39,366
- But not eating those.
- Right. Right.

494
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:42,950
Right. They're not eating these.
And how do they know they're diseased?

495
00:57:43,277 --> 00:57:46,986
It took me 24 hours with all this shit
I got to work with here to find that out.

496
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,604
- Must be smart.
- Damn smart.

497
00:57:50,444 --> 00:57:51,556
It's a predator.

498
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,791
One with two feet and a warped brain.
Homo sapiens. The worst in the lot.

499
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:01,412
Cannibalism? People eating people?

500
00:58:02,154 --> 00:58:04,423
Come on, Fergie,
those aren't human teeth marks.

501
00:58:07,113 --> 00:58:11,237
Fergie, come on around here, man.
And look at these striations in the scope.

502
00:58:16,936 --> 00:58:19,456
Now that's off his wrist.
That's from the throat.

503
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:21,728
- Is it an animal?
- Maybe.

504
00:58:22,408 --> 00:58:23,749
Well, it ain't human.

505
00:58:26,855 --> 00:58:28,132
Shape-shifting.

506
00:58:32,422 --> 00:58:35,421
The body's just a physical expression
of the soul.

507
00:58:35,494 --> 00:58:37,949
The soul can shift the body
into any shape it wants.

508
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,839
Kind of survival of the shiftiest.

509
00:58:39,909 --> 00:58:42,461
- What is that shit?
- Reality is just a state of mind.

510
00:58:42,532 --> 00:58:44,321
You change the mind, you can change the...

511
00:58:44,388 --> 00:58:45,565
Fergie! Please!

512
00:58:46,884 --> 00:58:48,640
The striations, man, in the scope.

513
00:58:52,707 --> 00:58:54,234
I just got here. Give me time.

514
00:58:55,043 --> 00:58:57,050
What are you,
double-parked or something?

515
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:00,639
- What else you got?
- Well, I got my Bronx liver.

516
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:02,461
You done a phosphoresus on this?

517
00:59:03,522 --> 00:59:06,205
I missed dinner for this.
You want to order a pizza?

518
00:59:06,273 --> 00:59:08,345
No, man, I feel like some ribs.

519
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:06,330
Dewey, I told you, man.

520
01:03:08,255 --> 01:03:09,661
It's all in the head.

521
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,181
When a wolf pack confronts a moose,
their eyes lock.

522
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:02,159
If the moose stands its ground,
the wolves will pass.

523
01:04:02,231 --> 01:04:04,784
If he runs,
this tells the wolf he's ready to die.

524
01:04:07,158 --> 01:04:10,060
Jaw pressure:
1,500 pounds per square inch.

525
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:12,786
Pulverizing bones as big as baseball bats.

526
01:04:12,886 --> 01:04:15,220
Auditory range: 100,000 cycles.

527
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:17,739
Bat sonar down to earth tremors.

528
01:04:18,869 --> 01:04:22,414
Visual acuity:
20 over 1.2 at 0.5 lumens, starlight.

529
01:04:23,061 --> 01:04:26,770
Range: 100 millimicrons ultraviolet
to 2,000 millimicrons infrared.

530
01:04:27,348 --> 01:04:28,624
Heat vision.

531
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:36,810
Maximum speed: 40 miles per hour.

532
01:05:43,113 --> 01:05:45,349
Yeah, hello, I want to report a fire.

533
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,636
64th Street and Fifth Avenue.

534
01:05:50,824 --> 01:05:53,987
I don't know the number.
The building's in blazes. You can't miss it.

535
01:05:54,055 --> 01:05:56,193
It's at 64th Street and Fifth Avenue.

536
01:05:56,455 --> 01:05:57,404
Yeah.

537
01:05:57,894 --> 01:06:00,228
Oh, yeah. I'm Peter. Peter Wolf.

538
01:07:04,606 --> 01:07:06,231
I knew you were here.

539
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:27,832
Oh, my God!

540
01:10:47,934 --> 01:10:49,210
What is it?

541
01:10:54,813 --> 01:10:56,241
Is it Eddie Holt?

542
01:13:48,868 --> 01:13:52,381
It's all very weird, Dew.
And it ain't just New York.

543
01:13:55,363 --> 01:13:57,730
I started out with just Newark and Philly...

544
01:13:57,795 --> 01:14:00,794
...cross-referencing spare parts rooms
with their ME reports.

545
01:14:00,866 --> 01:14:03,255
Dew! We got verification on our M.O.!

546
01:14:04,066 --> 01:14:07,481
New Orleans came up with a hair!
A goddamn Canis lupis hair.

547
01:14:17,344 --> 01:14:19,449
On a diseased human liver.

548
01:14:19,936 --> 01:14:21,310
And I'm checking other cities.

549
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:23,284
Do you realize
how many people disappear?

550
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,399
Vanish every year without a trace?

551
01:14:26,847 --> 01:14:28,669
I think I know where they're going.

552
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:43,737
No, man, no.

553
01:14:44,892 --> 01:14:47,674
I don't know, between me and Fergie,
last I spoke to him...

554
01:14:48,507 --> 01:14:51,922
...we can't come up with anything
that's got the capacity to do all this.

555
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,103
Have you seen Professor Ferguson?

556
01:14:57,531 --> 01:14:59,025
Okay. Solid, solid.

557
01:15:00,122 --> 01:15:04,115
Fergie never went home last night.
His mother called up. Freaked out!

558
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:06,357
What is this?

559
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,019
Maybe we should put out
an All Points on him.

560
01:15:12,537 --> 01:15:14,773
- Victim or suspect?
- Fergie?

561
01:15:15,448 --> 01:15:17,520
No, man. I know Fergie for five years.

562
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:20,884
He's weird, but he ain't that weird.

563
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:24,402
Maybe we should show this
to the Commissioner.

564
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:27,339
Show what?
How 'bout some corroboration?

565
01:15:27,894 --> 01:15:30,316
You get slammed
into a psychiatric review board...

566
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:34,866
You know, man, this is...
And you can't eat just one.

567
01:15:36,821 --> 01:15:39,057
Right, Doc? Can't eat just one?

568
01:15:45,204 --> 01:15:47,592
- Stand by.
- Should see him right now.

569
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:49,931
Do you know the group Götterdämmerung?

570
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:54,639
Absolutely. The first connection
that I had with Hans Meyer...

571
01:15:54,834 --> 01:15:58,150
...who founded the group,
was eight years ago at the Sorbonne.

572
01:15:58,226 --> 01:16:01,324
We've been operating in the States
for the past year and a half.

573
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:04,490
You could say we've harassed the boys
who are calling the shots.

574
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:07,495
- Like the Van der Veers?
- Yes. Like the Van der Veers.

575
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,887
- Harass might include assassination?
- Absolutely.

576
01:16:11,152 --> 01:16:12,580
Give me a replay on that.

577
01:16:19,151 --> 01:16:21,703
Harass might include assassination?

578
01:16:22,062 --> 01:16:23,589
Absolutely.

579
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,702
Notify Warren and the FBI.

580
01:16:30,509 --> 01:16:34,186
Listen, I hate violence, Dew.
But if violence comes...

581
01:16:34,477 --> 01:16:38,153
...l'm ready.
I'm a dead shot and a karate expert.

582
01:16:38,284 --> 01:16:39,713
My whole body's a weapon.

583
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:53,928
I'm not even going to ask.

584
01:16:55,082 --> 01:16:56,936
Ross and the Feds have got a big play.

585
01:16:57,002 --> 01:16:59,871
- We're invited. You don't need a tie.
- Don't like parties.

586
01:17:01,257 --> 01:17:04,705
You and Whittington stay here
and play with hairs and dead derelicts.

587
01:17:04,776 --> 01:17:06,053
There's a connection.

588
01:17:07,592 --> 01:17:10,974
To Van der Veer? That's a big jump
from the South Bronx to Wall Street.

589
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:14,343
On Sunday mornings, folks like to dress up
and go downtown to eat.

590
01:17:14,407 --> 01:17:16,414
Do they?
Why didn't they eat Van der Veer?

591
01:17:16,487 --> 01:17:18,875
- He's got to taste better than a junkie.
- I don't know.

592
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:21,186
But do you know
how many people disappear daily?

593
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:24,924
- Hey! Twenty-eight years.
- Right, you know. Hundreds.

594
01:17:24,998 --> 01:17:27,780
Nobody gives a shit
until it's somebody who'll be missed.

595
01:17:27,845 --> 01:17:28,641
So?

596
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:31,196
So the APB on Ferguson
is coming up goose eggs.

597
01:17:31,684 --> 01:17:33,953
- Who?
- Dr. Ferguson.

598
01:17:35,396 --> 01:17:37,152
Listen, what the fuck have you got?

599
01:17:37,924 --> 01:17:38,872
Nothing...

600
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:40,318
...yet!

601
01:17:52,162 --> 01:17:54,714
- Whit, you take that building over there.
- Yeah.

602
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:56,671
- That'll be a good place.
- All right.

603
01:17:56,737 --> 01:17:58,908
Go to the third floor
and look for the church.

604
01:17:58,977 --> 01:18:01,343
You should see the church
from that side, okay?

605
01:18:01,408 --> 01:18:04,026
- Yeah, all right.
- Rig up your mike and I'll be in touch.

606
01:20:11,342 --> 01:20:12,651
Asshole.

607
01:20:16,781 --> 01:20:18,471
Whit, where are you?

608
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:20,457
Check the light.

609
01:20:23,884 --> 01:20:25,673
Black moon over Manhattan.

610
01:20:31,723 --> 01:20:34,886
I'll tell you, Dew,
I'm starting to feel a little foolish out here.

611
01:20:34,987 --> 01:20:38,980
Ain't going to bag no game tonight, man.
They're too smart for you, babe.

612
01:20:39,914 --> 01:20:43,710
Probably eating in town tonight.
A little white meat, little stuffing...

613
01:20:44,937 --> 01:20:47,490
...brandy, cigars...

614
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:49,509
They're here.

615
01:20:50,024 --> 01:20:51,301
"They're here."

616
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:08,605
Hey, where are you going?
What the hell are you doing, man?

617
01:21:08,709 --> 01:21:10,302
I'll just take a look.

618
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:50,911
See you around.

619
01:22:27,963 --> 01:22:29,392
You gonna check the tower?

620
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,891
So? Anything?

621
01:23:43,568 --> 01:23:45,477
Dew? What's going on?

622
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:47,021
Fucking birds!

623
01:24:11,531 --> 01:24:13,189
Does that thing have a basement?

624
01:24:15,691 --> 01:24:17,578
Getting a little excited, Dew?

625
01:24:20,395 --> 01:24:21,671
Pants getting wet yet?

626
01:24:32,745 --> 01:24:34,632
Goddamn it, Whittington!

627
01:26:14,523 --> 01:26:18,297
1-12-83. Apprehension of terrorist group
Götterdämmerung.

628
01:26:18,362 --> 01:26:20,434
Alleged suspects
of the Van der Veer slaying.

629
01:26:20,569 --> 01:26:21,911
12:00.

630
01:26:21,977 --> 01:26:24,366
The subjects were defeated
with light resistance.

631
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,382
Look at that.

632
01:26:35,288 --> 01:26:36,662
Punch up the arrest.

633
01:26:39,415 --> 01:26:43,211
Check with the boss. See how much time
we have before releasing this to the news.

634
01:27:56,172 --> 01:27:58,277
It's not wolves. It's Wolfen.

635
01:27:58,827 --> 01:28:02,656
For 20,000 years, Wilson,
10 times your fucking Christian era...

636
01:28:04,299 --> 01:28:07,495
...the Skins and the wolves,
great hunting nations, lived together.

637
01:28:07,978 --> 01:28:11,011
Nature in balance.
Then the slaughter came.

638
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,031
The smartest ones...

639
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:19,487
...they went underground.

640
01:28:20,808 --> 01:28:23,197
Into the new wilderness. Your cities.

641
01:28:24,552 --> 01:28:28,545
Into the great slum areas,
the graveyard of your fucking species.

642
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:33,119
These great hunters
became your scavengers.

643
01:28:34,534 --> 01:28:38,363
Your garbage, your abandoned people
became their new meat animal.

644
01:28:39,846 --> 01:28:44,001
- But they're only...
- Animals? Are you sure, Wilson?

645
01:28:44,357 --> 01:28:45,731
They might be gods.

646
01:28:47,141 --> 01:28:48,482
In their eyes...

647
01:28:49,477 --> 01:28:50,906
...you are the savage.

648
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,985
You got your technology, but you lost.

649
01:28:55,524 --> 01:28:56,985
You lost your senses.

650
01:29:15,808 --> 01:29:20,564
They can see two looks away.
They can hear clouds pass overhead.

651
01:29:21,504 --> 01:29:24,406
In their world,
there can be no lies, no crime.

652
01:29:24,576 --> 01:29:25,950
No need for detectives.

653
01:29:26,047 --> 01:29:29,593
- They are brothers.
- No! They are other nations.

654
01:29:32,415 --> 01:29:33,843
Their world is older.

655
01:29:34,654 --> 01:29:37,687
More finished, more complete.

656
01:29:40,606 --> 01:29:43,834
- They kill.
- The sick, the abandoned.

657
01:29:45,564 --> 01:29:48,378
- Those who will not be missed.
- More than that.

658
01:29:48,892 --> 01:29:51,761
They kill to survive. They kill to protect.

659
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:55,827
- Family?
- Man kills for less.

660
01:29:57,147 --> 01:29:59,928
But in the end, it is all for hunting ground.

661
01:30:02,842 --> 01:30:04,500
You've seen them, haven't you?

662
01:30:07,609 --> 01:30:09,518
You don't have the eyes of the hunter.

663
01:30:10,809 --> 01:30:12,435
You have the eyes of the dead.

664
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,549
Shit, man! This is all just Indian jive.

665
01:30:22,615 --> 01:30:25,168
We've been watching
too many cowboy movies.

666
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:34,318
Don't even think
about believing any of this shit.

667
01:30:34,390 --> 01:30:36,331
It's the 20th century.

668
01:30:39,029 --> 01:30:40,654
We've got it all figured out.

669
01:31:09,425 --> 01:31:10,854
Family.

670
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:33,830
Hunting.

671
01:31:44,044 --> 01:31:45,156
Hunting.

672
01:31:47,179 --> 01:31:48,161
Hunting.

673
01:32:09,897 --> 01:32:11,173
Territory.

674
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,217
Territory.

675
01:32:15,111 --> 01:32:16,038
Terrorism.

676
01:32:20,295 --> 01:32:21,571
Terror.

677
01:32:38,628 --> 01:32:40,221
Ground breaking.

678
01:32:48,995 --> 01:32:51,067
Ground breaking ceremony.

679
01:33:21,918 --> 01:33:25,081
In the largest urban renewal project
since the early '70s...

680
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:28,629
...construction on Van der Veer Tower,
the luxury condominium complex...

681
01:33:28,701 --> 01:33:30,010
...started today.

682
01:33:30,525 --> 01:33:32,914
It marks the beginning
of the rebirth of this city.

683
01:33:36,508 --> 01:33:39,355
They kill to protect their hunting ground.

684
01:33:39,419 --> 01:33:41,426
...South Bronx with a silver shovel...

685
01:33:41,499 --> 01:33:44,400
...surrounded by notable personalities
of the tri-state area.

686
01:33:44,474 --> 01:33:46,613
Twenty-eight acres of deserted rubble
will be...

687
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:50,607
Mr. Van der Veer's real estate project.
Ground breaking ceremony was Saturday.

688
01:33:55,641 --> 01:33:57,234
Hunting ground.

689
01:34:03,608 --> 01:34:06,477
Sorry, Dewey, I couldn't resist.
There's your wolf.

690
01:34:08,664 --> 01:34:10,802
- What's this?
- It's your wolf hair.

691
01:34:11,127 --> 01:34:13,582
We found it when
the Götterdämmerung group was captured.

692
01:34:13,655 --> 01:34:16,851
Their terrorist motto,
"The end of the world by wolves."

693
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:19,438
We had an informer.
We'll get a confession.

694
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:22,251
Come on, Dewey, let's get out of here.

695
01:34:34,035 --> 01:34:35,628
Dewey, what happened?

696
01:35:13,902 --> 01:35:15,811
Come on, Dewey. Car's over here.

697
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,240
I'll be god-fucking-damned!

698
01:36:45,793 --> 01:36:47,385
Don't do it!

699
01:36:49,952 --> 01:36:51,513
Don't even think.

700
01:37:34,331 --> 01:37:36,152
348 Stock Exchange.

701
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:33,638
Shit!

702
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:01,086
Are you sure, Wilson? They might be gods.

703
01:40:01,157 --> 01:40:05,051
Their senses transport them
inside of your mind.

704
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:07,197
The smartest ones,
they went underground.

705
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:13,343
Hunter and prey.

706
01:40:13,412 --> 01:40:16,924
- Nature in balance.
- In their world, there can be no lies...

707
01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:20,252
...no crimes.
- No need for detectives.

708
01:40:20,323 --> 01:40:23,671
In their eyes, you are the savage.

709
01:40:28,098 --> 01:40:29,046
Dewey!

710
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:57,074
Dewey!

711
01:42:25,201 --> 01:42:26,510
...eight, seven...

712
01:42:26,896 --> 01:42:28,871
...six, five...

713
01:42:29,424 --> 01:42:30,536
...four...

714
01:42:30,608 --> 01:42:32,583
...three, two...

715
01:42:32,816 --> 01:42:33,830
...one!

716
01:43:08,491 --> 01:43:09,636
No shooting!

717
01:43:15,849 --> 01:43:16,798
No!

718
01:43:44,838 --> 01:43:46,463
What the hell happened up here?

719
01:43:47,909 --> 01:43:49,087
Terrorists.

720
01:43:49,989 --> 01:43:51,233
Götterdämmerung?

721
01:43:52,132 --> 01:43:53,026
Yeah.

722
01:43:53,925 --> 01:43:55,331
Götterdämmerung.

723
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:16,155
In arrogance,
man knows nothing of what exists.

724
01:44:16,897 --> 01:44:19,614
There exists on earth,
such as we dare not imagine.

725
01:44:20,449 --> 01:44:22,521
Life as certain as our death.

726
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,233
Life that will prey on us
as we prey on this earth.
