1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,010
Night of the Demons 2 (1994)
OliveFilms Bluray Release.

2
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:39,470
Doesn't look like
anyone's home.

3
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:42,140
You mustn't give up
so easily, Albert.

4
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:44,810
We've come all this way.
Let's just see.

5
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:57,623
Hello?

6
00:00:59,224 --> 00:01:00,292
Hello?

7
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,563
Anybody home?

8
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:09,902
You know, I don't think
anyone's living here.

9
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:15,239
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to frighten you.

10
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,841
Oh, well...

11
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:18,976
We didn't think
anyone was home.

12
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:20,044
Oh.

13
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,180
Have you been saved?

14
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,247
Who, me?

15
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:25,383
We're here spreading
the good word.

16
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:29,120
Do you realize that the end
of the world is drawing near?

17
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:31,255
As a matter of fact, I do.

18
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:33,925
I was just about to
have a slice of cake!

19
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,060
Would you two like to join me?

20
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:38,196
Huh. Well, how kind.

21
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:39,798
Yes, thank you.

22
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:47,271
This is a big house
you have here.

23
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:48,873
Must need a lot of upkeep.

24
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,542
Not really.

25
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:52,611
Ooh, yum.

26
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,821
Well, I hope you're hungry.

27
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:04,889
I think...

28
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,024
we'll skip the cake.

29
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:10,228
Oh, don't be silly.

30
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,432
It's devil's food!

31
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,380
Mmm.

32
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:11,415
♪ I'm not a warrior ♪

33
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,483
♪ But I am a lover ♪

34
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:15,152
She's so beautiful.

35
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:17,822
Oh, turn around.

36
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,424
Please turn around.

37
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:24,228
Yes. Bingo!

38
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,965
Hey, come on, Kurt.
I paid for half of those.

39
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,033
Come on, you hog
them every night.

40
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,101
It's my turn.

41
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,771
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I was just bedazzled.

42
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,710
Jesus, Perry, you just now
getting out of the bathroom?

43
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:41,846
What the hell you been doing
there this whole time?

44
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,447
Spanking your monkey again?

45
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:45,049
Gee, how time flies.

46
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,718
You're the one with
the binoculars.

47
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:53,058
♪ When I steal
your heart away ♪

48
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:57,328
♪ I'll steal your heart... ♪

49
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:58,930
Damn it, Kurt, they're turning
out the lights already.

50
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,065
You can go first
tomorrow night.

51
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,667
Tomorrow night's the dance.

52
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:04,802
So?

53
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:07,163
They'll still have to take their
clothes off when it's over.

54
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:10,675
Bibi.

55
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:11,743
Yes.

56
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,615
The day after the party, the county
sheriff went in with his deputies.

57
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:21,886
They found the kids, or rather,
what was left of them.

58
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:26,691
Their bodies were chopped,
grated, sliced, and diced.

59
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:27,758
Totally toasted.

60
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,894
I'm talking ground round.

61
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:30,962
Terri!

62
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,563
Their relatives could
barely identify them.

63
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:34,699
But they did.

64
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,300
Every one of them.

65
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,970
Every one except Angela.

66
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,037
Angela?

67
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,639
The girl who threw the party.

68
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,308
They searched the
property over and over,

69
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,444
hi and low,

70
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,045
but never found her body.

71
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:51,248
They say it's because she
descended into hell,

72
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:53,384
body and soul,

73
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,519
and now she's
Satan's favorite,

74
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,723
sitting on his lap.

75
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:00,859
She's probably sitting on
his big spike right now.

76
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:06,731
There's some things that
you shouldn't joke about.

77
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:07,798
Go to bed, Mouse.

78
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,934
My name's Melissa.

79
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,002
All right, Melissa.

80
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,604
Go to bed.

81
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,875
Before I cut your tail off.

82
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:21,679
So this place, Hull House,

83
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,280
it still exists?

84
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:27,019
Oh, yeah. Right at the
end of Old Hull Road.

85
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,288
Every so often, some kids
venture out there on a dare.

86
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:32,356
Some of them come back

87
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:35,026
insisting that Angela
is still in the house

88
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,162
searching for her
missing party guests.

89
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:41,432
Some claim to have actually
heard the swooshing

90
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,567
of her long black
wedding dress

91
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:46,237
as it sweeps against
the mildewed walls.

92
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,906
Others claim to have
actually seen her,

93
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:54,246
now a demon floating through
the long dark hallways,

94
00:06:55,847 --> 00:07:00,117
and some never
come back at all.

95
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,185
Oh, right.

96
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,253
Are you scared?

97
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:03,855
You wish.

98
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:08,126
Lights out.

99
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:48,165
Mouse.

100
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,768
Mouse, wake up.

101
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:57,242
Angela?

102
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:01,512
Am I dreaming?

103
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,181
No, you're not
dreaming, silly.

104
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:06,318
I'm right here, see?

105
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,521
Smile, sis!

106
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:33,544
Mouse!

107
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:34,613
Come on.

108
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:37,282
Terri.

109
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,500
En garde.

110
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,636
Coupè. Coulè.

111
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,771
Tiercè.

112
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,374
Touchè.

113
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:05,042
Who is it?

114
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:06,644
It's Father Bob, Sister.

115
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,780
Come in.

116
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,982
Good morning, Sister Gloria.

117
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,584
Oh, good morning.

118
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:15,186
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

119
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,787
Oh, no, no, no, no. Come in.

120
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,389
What can I do for you, Father?

121
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,592
Well, um, the reason
I stopped by is

122
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:24,795
I wanted to talk to you about
the school dance tonight.

123
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:25,863
School dance?

124
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:28,532
Yes, I thought it would
be a great opportunity

125
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:32,269
for the kids to, well,
cut loose for a change.

126
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,871
Cut loose?

127
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:34,939
Yes, you know.

128
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,608
Burn up some of that
youthful exuberance

129
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,811
by having the kids get more
involved in running the dance

130
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:43,480
and take some responsibility
for creating their own fun.

131
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,548
What do you think?

132
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:47,751
Well, Father, these
children are troubled

133
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:50,421
and the parents send them
here for discipline.

134
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:51,488
No, Sister.

135
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:54,158
No, Sister, their
parents send them here

136
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,293
in order for us to
help them adjust

137
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,963
in growing up with the
pressures of today's world.

138
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:02,700
What they need to learn
is responsibility,

139
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,301
not discipline.

140
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:08,038
But I've been running the
Halloween dance for 15 years now.

141
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,640
Precisely!

142
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:14,445
Now, all I'm asking is for a
little fresh input from the kids.

143
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:17,114
Input? Father Edward
would never have--

144
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:18,716
Father Edward is in
Somalia, Sister.

145
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:23,520
Now, if you'd like, I'm sure I could
arrange a transfer to his clinic.

146
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:27,258
Have you been
vaccinated for malaria?

147
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,393
St. Rita's is my home, Father.

148
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:32,596
Well, then, I'm sure
you'll make every effort

149
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:34,732
to make it a happy one...

150
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,935
for all of us,
including the kids.

151
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:42,206
Look, just work
with them, Sister.

152
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:43,807
Is that too much to ask?

153
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:45,943
Whatever you say, Father.

154
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:48,613
Good.

155
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:05,696
Hi, there.

156
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:06,764
You're Melissa, right?

157
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:09,433
Yeah.

158
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,035
Are you going to the dance?

159
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,636
Dance?

160
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:14,239
Yeah, you know, the
big Halloween dance.

161
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,442
Maybe I'll see you there.

162
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,983
I can't believe Mouse
is Angela's sister.

163
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:29,186
Yeah, well, after she wakes up with a
few more of those screaming nightmares,

164
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,788
maybe then you'll believe it.

165
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,389
Does she do that often?

166
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,525
Just about every other night.

167
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:36,660
What a freak.

168
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:38,262
Hey, Mouse is all right.

169
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:41,465
She's just had it a
little rough, that's all.

170
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:42,533
A little rough? Yeah.

171
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:43,600
So who hasn't?

172
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:45,202
Well, listen to this.

173
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,338
About a year ago her
parents received

174
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,939
a weird Halloween card.

175
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,075
It was homemade and
really creepy,

176
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:54,278
like, decorated with dead
bugs and dried blood.

177
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,879
It was totally disgusting.

178
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,549
Anyway, it was
signed by Angela.

179
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,150
They really took it hard.

180
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:02,820
Everyone tried to convince them
that it was just a really bad joke,

181
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:06,023
but they swore that
it was her signature.

182
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:08,692
That night, they both
committed suicide.

183
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:10,294
Suicide?

184
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,429
That's why she's here.

185
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,031
She's an orphan.

186
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:15,633
No shit.

187
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,371
She's a charity case.

188
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:25,242
Stop that vicious gossip.

189
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:28,445
Whatever the truth is about
Melissa and her family,

190
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:31,115
I want you all to show a
little bit more compassion

191
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,182
for her in the future.

192
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:35,387
Things are bad enough for
her without your abuse.

193
00:12:54,072 --> 00:12:55,672
Hey, beautiful.

194
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:56,740
Tonight's the night.

195
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:57,808
I can't wait.

196
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,410
I had a dream about you.

197
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,011
You did?

198
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:03,147
Mm-hmm.

199
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,283
Save a little room
for the Holy Ghost.

200
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,096
Sorry.

201
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,704
Thanks.

202
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,306
You're such a gentleman.

203
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:34,111
And these are things you will need
to know when you are married.

204
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:38,916
Now, don't be shy, girls. I know that
this is an embarrassing subject,

205
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,585
but if one doesn't
ask questions,

206
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:45,322
one never learns, does one?

207
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:46,390
Yes, Teresa?

208
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:49,059
Sister, is it a sin
to kiss a boy?

209
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,196
I mean, if you really,
really like him?

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,669
A kiss is a sin

211
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,270
when it is an upper persuasion

212
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:02,407
for a lower invasion.

213
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,414
Yes, Shirley?

214
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:12,549
Sister Gloria,

215
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,821
is fellatio a mortal
sin or a venial sin?

216
00:14:20,024 --> 00:14:22,694
Fellatio.

217
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:26,431
I don't think I'm
familiar with that term.

218
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,973
Could you please explain to the
class exactly what that means?

219
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,980
What's the matter,
Miss Finnerty?

220
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:45,650
Cat got your tongue?

221
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,920
Oh, by the way, boys,

222
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:53,123
Sister Gloria has
called my attention

223
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,792
to the fact that several
imaginative rumors

224
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,394
have been circulating throughout
the school

225
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:59,530
regarding a certain
local landmark.

226
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,665
Hull House.

227
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,267
Yes, Kurt, that is correct.

228
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:04,334
Hull House.

229
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:07,004
A typical urban folktale.

230
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,673
Folktales? Mm-hmm.

231
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:11,808
You can't write that stuff
off as folktales, Father.

232
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:13,944
Why not? Well, that stuff
really did happen.

233
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:15,546
It's a matter of record.

234
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,215
Well, of course, they
happened, Johnny,

235
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,283
but things happen everywhere.

236
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:21,952
Uh, excuse me, Father?

237
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:25,155
Yes, Perry, what is it?

238
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:27,824
Rather than blindly dismissing the
legend of Hull House completely,

239
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:31,562
perhaps it would be more constructive
to discuss demonic phenomena

240
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,164
from a religious perspective.

241
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:36,900
Perry, this is a
catechism class,

242
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:39,036
not Demonology 101.

243
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:42,773
Yeah, but demonology is part
of our catechism, Father.

244
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,374
Excuse me?

245
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,044
Well, the church gets its directive
from Jesus Himself, right?

246
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,111
Yes.

247
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,713
Well, He cast out
demonic spirits

248
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:51,848
no less than 26
times in the Bible.

249
00:15:51,849 --> 00:15:53,450
Well, yes,

250
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:56,653
but why don't we discuss some
of Jesus' other teachings,

251
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:59,323
such as love for all mankind?

252
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:00,924
Father? Yes.

253
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:05,195
You mean the kind of love
we get from Sister Gloria?

254
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:07,331
Yeah, like on the tip
of her yardstick.

255
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:10,000
All right, boys.
That's enough.

256
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:11,068
Excuse me, Father. Yes?

257
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:13,203
I have been researching demonic
possession.

258
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:14,805
Well, therein lies
your problem, Perry.

259
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:16,940
You're wasting your time reading
the wrong kind of books.

260
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:19,077
Stick with this one.

261
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:21,745
Go ahead, laugh.

262
00:16:21,746 --> 00:16:23,880
It won't be long before
somebody proves that

263
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:26,550
demonic energies
do indeed exist.

264
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,685
And maybe then, Father,
demonology will finally get

265
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:30,821
the kind of scientific
credibility it deserves.

266
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:33,490
Ah, yes, Perry, I'm sure it
will rank right up there

267
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,159
with astrology and
trance channeling.

268
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,499
And now my spirit guide
says it's time for...

269
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,701
math.

270
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:45,770
Open 'em up.

271
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:58,048
Jordan's got the ball!

272
00:16:58,049 --> 00:16:59,116
He's charging down the line!

273
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:00,717
He's got it. He's got it!

274
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:01,785
It's 10, 9, 8--
It's going nowhere.

275
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:03,387
He's got only one shot.

276
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:04,454
He goes, shoots!

277
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,590
Oh, man.

278
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:08,725
Hey, butthead, what are you
looking for, a fat lip?

279
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:09,793
I want my book.

280
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:11,395
What book?

281
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:12,462
Come on, you know what book.

282
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:13,530
That's a rare text.

283
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:14,598
It cost me a
month's allowance.

284
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,199
What's the problem here?

285
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,403
Oh, the old sexorcist here thinks I stole
his precious little ghoulie book.

286
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,470
Yeah, so?

287
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:23,140
So what would
I want with a book?

288
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,207
Good point.

289
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,343
Perry, Kurt doesn't
have your book.

290
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:27,944
He can barely read a clock.

291
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:29,012
Thank you. Sure.

292
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,148
You guys think you're
so great just because

293
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,283
you're bigger, tougher, and
better-looking than everybody else.

294
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:34,351
I'm gonna show you that--

295
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:35,952
He said he doesn't
have your book.

296
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:38,622
I'm gonna prove
that demons exist.

297
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:40,223
Yeah, well, you're
living proof.

298
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:42,359
Look, why don't you go haunt
a house or something,

299
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,640
let us finish our
lunch in peace?

300
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,765
Whoa. Speaking of lunch.

301
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:52,502
Ooh. Check out
those headlights.

302
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:54,104
That's something that could
really brighten my day.

303
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:57,307
That's what I'd call
double trouble.

304
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:59,976
It's the kind of trouble I'd
like to get my hands on.

305
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,578
Oh, yeah?

306
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,180
So do it, dude,

307
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,316
unless you left your balls
in your other Calvins.

308
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:11,722
Just pay attention, junior.

309
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:12,789
You just might learn something.

310
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,391
From you?

311
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,527
Just watch the bouncing ball.

312
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:22,933
Looks like I caught something.

313
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,068
Yeah, or something caught you.

314
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,204
Sorry. Slippery fingers.

315
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,873
Name's Kurt. Ladies
call me Kingsnake.

316
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:33,077
Oh, really? I heard
they call you Inchworm.

317
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:35,747
Yeah.

318
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,483
Can I at least get
the ball back?

319
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,085
Who's stopping you?

320
00:19:01,906 --> 00:19:04,041
I've got your ball.

321
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:08,311
Maybe we should throw
ice water on them.

322
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:10,447
Oh! Do you really think
that would stop them?

323
00:19:10,448 --> 00:19:11,448
Nah.

324
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,319
Shit. Sister.

325
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,922
Hey, Kurt.

326
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:25,929
What in the holy name of
glory is going on here?

327
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,666
I asked you a
question, young lady.

328
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:32,335
What is going on?

329
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:33,937
I see.

330
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,072
Struck dumb by the
devil, are we?

331
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:38,742
I knew from the
get-go I was going

332
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,877
to have trouble with you,
Miss Shirley Finnerty.

333
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,479
Kiss off, you old tyrant.
We were just--

334
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,614
You are lucky, young lady,

335
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:46,216
that there are laws
that prevent me

336
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,351
from giving you the
punishment that you deserve.

337
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:49,953
In the old days, I would've--

338
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,556
Would've what?

339
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,427
Well...

340
00:19:57,428 --> 00:20:02,232
I can see that you need time
to examine your conscience.

341
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:05,436
Therefore you will remain
in the dormitory tonight.

342
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,638
And that goes for your
friends here, too.

343
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,240
But, Sister, the dance!

344
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,842
Oh, hey, come on. We
didn't do anything.

345
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,579
We'll just give those
raging teenage hormones

346
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,181
a chance to cool down.

347
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:25,189
You old witch.

348
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,543
October 31st, 6:25 P.M.

349
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,678
I am in the sacristy of St.
Rita's chapel

350
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,882
preparing to conduct an
experiment of demon conjuration.

351
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,551
I've chosen the sacristy
for three reasons.

352
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,686
One, it is quiet.

353
00:20:56,687 --> 00:21:00,423
Two, it is the likely
vortex of mystical energy.

354
00:21:00,424 --> 00:21:02,560
Three, it's totally safe.

355
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:08,965
This sucks.

356
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:11,101
I have to set up for a dance
I'm not even invited to.

357
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:13,770
Isn't this some sort of
child abuse or something?

358
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:15,906
I'm gonna get a lawyer.

359
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,507
The Church is worth
lots of money.

360
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:18,575
I think we can get
rich off this.

361
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,177
Yeah, right.

362
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:23,380
Neil Diamond?

363
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,981
This stuff is fossil fuel.

364
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:27,651
This is Flintstones
top 10 countdown.

365
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:29,252
Ooh, you're right.

366
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:31,388
We're lucky we're not going to
old Gory's Jurassic hoe-down.

367
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,455
You said it.

368
00:21:32,456 --> 00:21:34,057
Oh, Kurt.

369
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:35,659
Got a minute?

370
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,726
Who, me?

371
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:38,328
Yeah, Einstein.

372
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,997
Y-O-O. You.

373
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,600
Yeah, sure.

374
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:50,608
Barry Manilow?

375
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:56,479
I will be using texts from the
ancient Assyrian Necronomicon

376
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,751
as phonetically translated by the
professor Heinrich Hilmeister.

377
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,436
"Mi-halo shaitan

378
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:22,639
"ben-el shaitan

379
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,376
shakraf hu y'ra."

380
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:31,181
"Mi-halo shaitan

381
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:33,850

00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:38,121

383
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:41,324

386
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:50,934
"Mi-halo shaitan..."

387
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:52,003
Who's there?

388
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:02,679
Perry!

389
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,814
Oh, thank God. Father Bob.

390
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,416
What are you doing in here

391
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,551
and why do you have
on my chasuble?

392
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:10,153
Don't be mad, Father.

393
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:12,288
I needed a safe place to
conduct my experiment.

394
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:13,890
Experiment?

395
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:15,492
Yeah, and it worked.

396
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:17,093
It worked better than
I could've dreamed.

397
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,695
I actually conjured a demon.

398
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:21,364
Conjured up a demon?
Oh, Perry.

399
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:24,567
Perry, I have given you
every chance I could,

400
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:27,237
but this obsession of yours has
gotten totally out of hand.

401
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:29,372
You're not listening
to me, Father.

402
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,508
I saw Angela. She's a demon.

403
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,109
The legend of Hull
House is true.

404
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,711
Perry... Father...

405
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:36,312
I saw her in the mirror.

406
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,448
Look, she attacked me.

407
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:39,516
I have scratches
all over my wrist.

408
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,117
She almost pulled me into
the mirror with her.

409
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,185
Silence.

410
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:45,388
Now, Perry, you have
desecrated the sacristy.

411
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,591
You have defiled
my holy vestments.

412
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:49,659
Not to mention the
damage you've done--

413
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,261
Father, haven't you
heard a word I said?

414
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:53,396
Yes, and I've heard
quite enough.

415
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,532
Now, go to the dormitory.

416
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:58,735
You're hereby grounded
until I decide otherwise.

417
00:23:58,736 --> 00:23:59,270
No dance tonight.

418
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,336
Oh, come on, Father...

419
00:24:00,337 --> 00:24:01,938
Go.

420
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:03,540
I'll take this.

421
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:07,277
I'll expect the rest of your
collection in my office tomorrow.

422
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:09,413
Drop it off before
your first class.

423
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,902
Whoa! Back off, Romeo.

424
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:35,038
Let's save some for later.

425
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,639
Later?

426
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,309
Now, listen, Shirley,
about this party.

427
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,444
You know, I really don't
think it's a good idea.

428
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:43,046
I mean, if we get
caught off campus,

429
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,181
Old Glory's really gonna
rip our head off.

430
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:47,317
Listen up, Inchworm,

431
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,986
this is gonna be the
party of the century.

432
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:52,655
Don't get me wrong. I don't
have a problem with it.

433
00:24:52,656 --> 00:24:54,791
You see, it's Johnny.

434
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,392
Oh, yeah?

435
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:59,596
Well, if you can't even get
your best friend to a party...

436
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:02,799
Jesus, I can't believe
I actually let you

437
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,400
touch my breasts.

438
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:07,071
I didn't say that
I couldn't get him to come.

439
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:10,273
Here's your invite.

440
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:11,875
All the cute girls
will be there,

441
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:12,942
including Bibi and Terri.

442
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:16,679
If you ain't at the
pick-up by 8 with Johnny,

443
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,816
forget you ever knew me.

444
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:24,687
♪ Can you rise above? ♪

445
00:25:24,688 --> 00:25:29,493
♪ Plant a little seed
and watch it grow... ♪

446
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,365
Oh, God, what was I thinking
when I bought this?

447
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:38,568
Bibi, you're not helping.

448
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:41,771
Who cares?

449
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:43,373
My world is over.

450
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:46,042
Well, mine isn't.

451
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,644
Bibi, hey.

452
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:51,915
I thought maybe you would want to
wear this to the dance tonight?

453
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,516
What are you talking
about, Mouse?

454
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:55,118
You trying to be funny?

455
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:57,253
No, I...

456
00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:58,321
I'm not going to the dance.

457
00:25:58,322 --> 00:25:59,923
You're not?

458
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:00,990
No, she's not.

459
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:03,126
You're good friend Sister
Gory grounded her.

460
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:04,727
Oh.

461
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:06,863
I'm sorry.

462
00:26:06,864 --> 00:26:08,998
No. Hey, I appreciate it.

463
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:11,134
It's really pretty.

464
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:12,735
You think so?

465
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:17,540
Um, I made it in
sewing class and...

466
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:21,811
I don't know, but I could never
wear anything like this.

467
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:22,879
Sure you could.

468
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,947
No.

469
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:25,548
Sure you could, Mouse.

470
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:28,752
After all, it is Halloween.

471
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:35,159
Here, I want you to have that.

472
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,429
All right, look, B., this
is what we're going to do.

473
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,564
All you need to do is go to Father Bob
and explain to him what happened.

474
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:43,166
He's gonna have to let
us go to the dance.

475
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:44,767
Fat chance.

476
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:45,835
I just saw Father Bob
in the courtyard

477
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:47,971
and he looked like he was
ready to kill somebody.

478
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:51,708
Forget it. Come on, get up.

479
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:54,377
Better start getting dressed
if you want to look your best.

480
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:55,979
Ooh, for what?

481
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,114
A leisurely night in the dorm?

482
00:26:58,115 --> 00:26:59,716
No, you dipshit, we're
going to a party,

483
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:02,919
and I ain't talking Sister
Gloria's stupid dance, either.

484
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,054
We're talking a real
Halloween party.

485
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:07,724
We're talking the sexiest guys

486
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,859
and the wildest
party games ever.

487
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,927
Yeah, right.

488
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:11,995
And I suppose that
you're gonna--

489
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:13,596
Zip it, lame-o.

490
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:16,799
Now, don't ask me how,

491
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,401
but I pulled some strings,

492
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:21,604
and I managed to get you
both on the A-list,

493
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:23,206
so don't wuss out.

494
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:24,807
And where's this party?

495
00:27:24,808 --> 00:27:26,943
Outside the walls of
this penitentiary,

496
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,612
and that's all you gotta know

497
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:32,282
except for the fact that
Johnny will be there.

498
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,417
Oh...

499
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:35,485
Johnny?

500
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,086
Yeah.

501
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:40,823
Oh, could you get
Mouse to come?

502
00:27:40,824 --> 00:27:42,960
Mouse?

503
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:47,230
Why do you want Mouse?

504
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:48,298
Why not?

505
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,968
Didn't Sister Gloria say
we should be nice to her?

506
00:27:53,103 --> 00:27:55,772
I don't know, Kurt. She
didn't even say where it is.

507
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:57,907
Who cares where it is?
It's a party, man.

508
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:01,110
And wherever it is,
Bibi's gonna be there.

509
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,713
Bibi?

510
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,457
And anybody who's anybody
is gonna be there.

511
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,592
Twist my arm.

512
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:19,262
You think I'd have to?

513
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:23,533
♪ When I touch,
it makes me shiver ♪

514
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:27,271
♪ When I feel,
it makes me shiver ♪

515
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,007
Hey, I don't know if we should

516
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,608
be doing this, you guys.

517
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:33,676
You're right, Mouse.

518
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:35,278
Why don't you just
go back to the dorm?

519
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,346
Terri, please.

520
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,481
Mouse, just relax.

521
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:39,549
It's a party.

522
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,150
Just stop worrying
for one night, okay?

523
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:42,752
It's gonna be fine.

524
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:44,887
Um, is it a costume party?

525
00:28:44,888 --> 00:28:47,023
No, Shirley told us
to come as we were.

526
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:49,158
Hey, if Sister Gloria finds
out we're doing this,

527
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,226
we're gonna get in trouble--

528
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:51,294
Gloria's not gonna find out.

529
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:52,895
We'll be back before
the dance is over.

530
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,498
Shh. Car's coming.

531
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:09,445
Let's go, gang. We ain't
waiting here all night.

532
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:11,581
Everybody, this is Rick.

533
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:12,648
Hey.

534
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:14,251
Come here, sweet tits.

535
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:24,928
Kurt.

536
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:28,131
Say hi to Rick.

537
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:29,198
Hey.

538
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,334
Let's move it, huh?

539
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:33,469
Jeez, I don't want to be doing
time here for hauling jail bait.

540
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,537
Let's go.

541
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:36,139
Glad you made it, Mouse.

542
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,275
My name's Melissa.

543
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:18,848
So, uh, Rick?

544
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:19,916
Huh?

545
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:22,051
What school do you go to?

546
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:24,720
I'm currently enrolled at the
school of hard knockers.

547
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:28,458
Yeah, but, you know, I'm pretty
much into the entire student body,

548
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,593
huh, Shirl?

549
00:30:30,594 --> 00:30:31,915
So you kids are all
troubled, huh?

550
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:36,466
How 'bout, you, Marcia?
What's your problem?

551
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,669
Actually, I, um...

552
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,270
I killed my parents.

553
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:42,872
Oh, yeah? Me, too.

554
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:43,941
All right.

555
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:05,828
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute.

556
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:07,430
I'm a little lost here.

557
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,498
Which way do we go?

558
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,566
Right. Go left.

559
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:12,768
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

560
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:13,837
Wussies.

561
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:58,147
Oh, God, no.

562
00:31:58,148 --> 00:32:00,816
No, this is Hull House.

563
00:32:00,817 --> 00:32:02,418
Mouse, I'm sorry.

564
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:03,486
Bibi, you tricked me.

565
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,087
No, Shirley didn't tell me.

566
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:08,291
Sorry, babe. The
Ritz was booked.

567
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:11,494
No. No, take me home.

568
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:12,562
I can't go here!

569
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,629
Would somebody shut her up?

570
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,765
Take me home! I can't go!

571
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:17,366
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

572
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:19,502
Shut up, Mouse.

573
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:20,570
No!

574
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,171
Maybe we should discuss this.

575
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:23,239
Yes.

576
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,307
Nobody knew that it was here.

577
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:26,443
Overruled.

578
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:42,992
You didn't tell us the
party was at Hull House.

579
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:45,662
I didn't say it wasn't, did I?

580
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:49,398
Johnny?

581
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:51,534
Well, we're here already.

582
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:52,602
We may as well make
the most of it.

583
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,738
You know, something to
tell our grandkids about.

584
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,076
Here, Shirl.

585
00:33:00,077 --> 00:33:01,143
Come on, Mouse.

586
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:02,745
You brought me here, Bibi.

587
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:03,813
Well, I didn't know.

588
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:05,948
Hey, come on, Mouse,
don't be afraid.

589
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:08,618
You're with us. Nothing's
gonna happen here tonight.

590
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,753
You know about my
sister, Angela.

591
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:14,490
Melissa, nobody knows for sure
what happened to your sister.

592
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:16,626
I mean, maybe she
just ran away.

593
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,295
Hey, look, if she wants
to stay here, fine.

594
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:21,431
Let her. Come on.

595
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:24,634
Wait a second. He did what?

596
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,304
You should have seen his face.

597
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,793
Oh, Angela!

598
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:53,462
Angela!

599
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:55,598
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

600
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,733
Your party guests are here!

601
00:33:57,734 --> 00:33:58,801
Shh! Come on!

602
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:00,403
This place used to
be a funeral home.

603
00:34:00,404 --> 00:34:04,141
So what? Are you afraid
I'll wake the dead?

604
00:34:11,615 --> 00:34:13,216
This is awesome.

605
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:37,239
♪ Close my eyes
and I'm lost ♪

606
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,977
♪ In a world
that's moving... ♪

607
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:46,850
Leave a little room
for the Holy Ghost.

608
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:52,723
Oh, God.

609
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,060
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

610
00:34:58,061 --> 00:34:59,129
Blessed are...

611
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:11,407
Real cute.

612
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:13,009
I don't think
Angela will mind.

613
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:17,280
There. Done.

614
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,642
What was that?

615
00:35:46,643 --> 00:35:48,244
Probably just Rick.

616
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:50,379
He's a real scream, isn't he?

617
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,515
I'm starving. What
is there to eat?

618
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:55,184
Well...

619
00:35:55,185 --> 00:35:57,853
Bibi's wearing candy pants.

620
00:35:57,854 --> 00:35:58,388
Oh, yeah?

621
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,989
What flavor?

622
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:02,659
Um, cherry?

623
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:05,861
Mmm. Johnny's favorite.

624
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:07,997
Oh, come on, guys.

625
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:09,598
Do you want to take a walk?

626
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,734
You're not afraid
of Hull House?

627
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:13,335
You'll protect me, won't you?

628
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:14,403
Oh, yeah.

629
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:16,539
Hey, wait a second, you guys.

630
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,674
You're not gonna leave
me here alone, are you?

631
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:20,277
You're not alone.

632
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:25,614
Hey, don't go too far.

633
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:27,750
I have a big
surprise coming up.

634
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:29,352
Oh, I can't wait.

635
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:48,571
Hey, Shirl,

636
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:50,172
check this out, huh?

637
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,308
Found it in the old morgue.

638
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:53,909
Hmm? Whoa.

639
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,112
Think of all the dead bodies
that slept on this thing.

640
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:58,180
Oh, yeah.

641
00:36:58,181 --> 00:36:59,248
Rick, check it out. Huh?

642
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:01,383
Shit.

643
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:02,986
What the hell?

644
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:07,256
Jesus, Rick, this paint sucks.

645
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:09,925
What do you want from me?
I stole the best I could.

646
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:12,061
This party sucks.

647
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:14,730
Why don't you go take
a little field trip?

648
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,332
Go do some sight seeing.

649
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,399
Hey, get out of here, man.

650
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,001
Rick and I will call
when we need ya.

651
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:20,604
Sure.

652
00:37:30,747 --> 00:37:32,348
So, did you bring the
little fuzz ball?

653
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:33,950
Mm-hmm.

654
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:36,619
Oh, how cute.

655
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,288
Yeah, the perfect
little victim.

656
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:40,890
For pin the knife
on the sacrifice.

657
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,026
Kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

658
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,034
What a dump.

659
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,389
Come on, Bibi.

660
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:18,274
Are you all right in there?

661
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:26,802
Serious, you had me worried.

662
00:38:26,803 --> 00:38:29,471
Ooh, it's cold out here.

663
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:35,345
Yeah, well, I know a place
where we can warm up.

664
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,547
You gotta keep
your eyes closed.

665
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:39,616
Okay. All right?

666
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:45,487
Okay.

667
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:47,623
Cool, huh?

668
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:48,691
Mm-hmm.

669
00:38:48,692 --> 00:38:50,292
Ow!

670
00:38:50,293 --> 00:38:52,428
Wanna party?

671
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:55,098
Absolutely.

672
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:02,571
Hey, stop it!

673
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:03,639
Shh.

674
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,309
What?

675
00:39:12,716 --> 00:39:14,317
Come on, stop.

676
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:17,520
Not here in the hallway.

677
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:50,086
You're so beautiful.

678
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:38,133
Somebody help me!

679
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:40,269
Woo hoo hoo!

680
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,871
Mouse?

681
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:47,743
Z-boy!

682
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:48,811
What's up, man? Hey, baby.

683
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:49,878
Happy Halloween, dude. Yeah!

684
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:53,615
Yeah, now. Hey, dollface.

685
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:55,751
Scared up another
party guest for ya.

686
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:56,819
Boo!

687
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,488
Well, you also scared
away our sacrifice, dude.

688
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:00,556
Ooh.

689
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:01,623
Hey, Shirl, you know what?

690
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:03,225
Who needs a cat...

691
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:04,827
when we got a little mouse?

692
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:06,962
Ooh, yeah, mama.

693
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:10,165
Yeah, who needs a cat?

694
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,835
Maybe we can find a virgin.

695
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:13,902
Mousy little mousy.

696
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:14,971
Mousy! Mousy!

697
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:20,309
Hey, what was that?

698
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,444
Olly olly oxen free!

699
00:41:22,445 --> 00:41:24,046
It's time for the
big surprise!

700
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:27,249
Hey, come on. We don't want
to miss the big surprise.

701
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,852
Come on.

702
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:46,469
This is so romantic.

703
00:41:51,274 --> 00:41:53,942
Oh, shit!

704
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:55,010
What the hell's going on?

705
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:57,679
Ah-ah-ah! Hold it
right there, hulk.

706
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,281
I don't think you want
to be doing that.

707
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:01,416
No, no, no, you just
shut the fuck up

708
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,552
and enjoy the show now, 'kay?

709
00:42:03,553 --> 00:42:04,621
Wohaa!

710
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:29,711
Tonight, we gather in
the name of darkness,

711
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:32,915
and with this
consecrated dagger,

712
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:36,118
we offer this virgin lamb.

713
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:37,187
That's Perry's book.

714
00:42:42,525 --> 00:42:47,329
Please accept her blood as
payment for the favors we seek.

715
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:50,532
Accept the purity
of her life force.

716
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:53,736
Feast on her virgin soul.

717
00:43:18,294 --> 00:43:20,964
Please, accept our
humble sacrifice.

718
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:24,701
Amen.

719
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:36,445
No!

720
00:43:36,446 --> 00:43:38,580
What do you think
you're doing, man?

721
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:41,250
Stop it! Stop!

722
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:42,317
Stop it!

723
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:44,454
Listen--

724
00:43:47,123 --> 00:43:48,190
Johnny, stop.

725
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:49,258
Stop?

726
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,325
I'm just getting started.

727
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:51,927
No, didn't you
hear that scream?

728
00:43:51,928 --> 00:43:53,528
No.

729
00:43:53,529 --> 00:43:56,198
It was probably just
some stupid prank.

730
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,334
No, I don't think so.

731
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:06,341
Look here, Hulkster.
No pain, no brain.

732
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:07,943
No cavity.

733
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:10,078
It don't slice, dice,
chop, or peel, my man.

734
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,214
It's the all new
amazing Knife-O-Matic.

735
00:44:12,215 --> 00:44:13,282
We like that, baby.

736
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:15,951
What's going on?

737
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:18,086
Dude, why didn't you guys
tell me it was a fake knife?

738
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:20,222
Jesus, what are you?
The joke inspector?

739
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:21,823
You ruined the prank, asswipe.

740
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:22,891
Oh, mama.

741
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:25,560
Look, we got us a little
miss prom queen here.

742
00:44:25,561 --> 00:44:27,162
Yeah, back off, pal.

743
00:44:27,163 --> 00:44:28,764
Oh, a tough guy, huh?

744
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:32,501
Tell me something, toughie,
is she as good as she looks?

745
00:44:32,502 --> 00:44:34,103
You'll never know.

746
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:36,772
You're breaking my heart.
You're breaking it in two.

747
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,907
Just let me have a
little something, boy.

748
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:40,509
Woo!

749
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:41,576
What the hell is that?

750
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:43,178
Something's happening.

751
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:44,246
Yeah, I can feel it.

752
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:46,915
Really, I can smell it.
It's gross.

753
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:49,051
Smells like a little
teen spirit to me.

754
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:50,118
Teen spirit, my ass.

755
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:51,721
It smells like
Godzilla's butthole.

756
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:03,999
It was Angela! It was Angela!

757
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,668
She was standing right there.
I saw her!

758
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:08,804
Bibi, take me out of here.
Please!

759
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:10,939
Okay, honey. Come on.

760
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,541
Please! Please.

761
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:13,608
No, she was here!

762
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:15,210
She was standing-- I saw
her standing right here!

763
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:16,813
Melissa, there's nobody here.
She's here!

764
00:45:18,948 --> 00:45:20,015
Holy shit, that is rank!

765
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:21,083
Hey, I don't know
about you guys,

766
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:22,684
but I say we get the
hell out of here now.

767
00:45:22,685 --> 00:45:24,286
This place bites the big one.

768
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:26,421
Yeah, wait a second, you
guys, I've gotta go pee.

769
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:28,023
Terri, you can hold it.

770
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:29,091
No, I don't think so.

771
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:30,692
Not if she's riding in my car.

772
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:32,294
Well, come on. Just
hurry up, will ya?

773
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:33,895
Look, I'll go with her.

774
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:35,498
It's right there.

775
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:40,837
Well, I think I gotta
go pee, too.

776
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:51,513
There it is.

777
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:53,649
Make it fast, would you?
Don't worry.

778
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:06,461
What do you want?

779
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:07,530
Go on now! Get.

780
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:20,809
What?

781
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,680
Come on, let's
get out of here.

782
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:27,283
Girls.

783
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:29,952
Kids.

784
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:48,103
Damn.

785
00:46:48,104 --> 00:46:50,238
Wait up for me, baby. Hey.

786
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:52,375
I'm ready for you.
Where you been? Hey!

787
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,577
Let's get the
hell out of here.

788
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:56,645
Terri, what's wrong?

789
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:58,246
Can we just go now, please?

790
00:46:58,247 --> 00:47:00,382
Hey, we ain't going
nowhere without Z-boy.

791
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:01,983
Well, where the hell is he?

792
00:47:01,984 --> 00:47:03,585
He went to take a leak. Did
you pass him in the hall?

793
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:05,188
No.

794
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:14,796
Okay, honey child,
I know you're up there.

795
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:17,466
Don't be playing no games
with old Z-boy, baby.

796
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,067
You can't get away from me.

797
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:20,670
Oooh.

798
00:47:37,753 --> 00:47:39,354
Oh, no. Dear God, no.

799
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:40,956
No, no, no, no!

800
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:42,558
What are you doing? No!

801
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:03,912
Jeez, doesn't the fun
ever end in this place?

802
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:08,183
Z-boy. That dude always has
to have the last laugh.

803
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:09,784
Well, let's just see
how hard he's laughing

804
00:48:09,785 --> 00:48:11,386
when he comes back here,
finds us all gone.

805
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:13,522
We can't just leave him here.

806
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,123
Hell we can't.

807
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:16,191
He got here on his
own, didn't he?

808
00:48:16,192 --> 00:48:18,327
Well, he can get his ass home.
I'm leaving.

809
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:24,733
Z-boy!

810
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:27,937
Z-boy!

811
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:33,809
Hey, Z-boy, we're
splitting, baby.

812
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:38,614
Fuck him.

813
00:48:43,419 --> 00:48:45,021
Oh, yeah.

814
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:54,095
Damn it, Shirl,
would you move it?

815
00:48:54,096 --> 00:48:56,765
Man, I have seen
enough of this place.

816
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:58,366
Come on!

817
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,036
Jesus, Rick, can't you wait more
than a minute for anything?

818
00:49:01,037 --> 00:49:03,172
Yeah, that's funny, Shirl.

819
00:49:29,332 --> 00:49:30,398
Thank goodness we're
out of there.

820
00:49:30,399 --> 00:49:32,000
I know what you mean.

821
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:34,669
Relax guys. Come on, we just
passed the underground stream.

822
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,271
What?

823
00:49:36,272 --> 00:49:38,940
The underground stream that
surrounds the property.

824
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:41,076
Everybody says it keeps
the demons inside.

825
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:42,678
Yeah, right.

826
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:46,415
We're safe now.

827
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:53,355
♪ Some say we're
in danger here ♪

828
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:57,626
♪ As long as we're
all strangers here... ♪

829
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,227
Sister Gloria.

830
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:00,295
Can I speak to you
for a minute?

831
00:50:00,296 --> 00:50:04,032
Certainly, Perry. You know, I'm
always here for you children,

832
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:06,701
though Father Bob might
choose to believe otherwise.

833
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:09,371
I don't want to get anybody
in trouble, but I think--

834
00:50:09,372 --> 00:50:10,972
Trouble? Don't be silly.

835
00:50:10,973 --> 00:50:13,108
You're not going to get
anyone in trouble. Speak up.

836
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:16,311
I think some of our kids snuck
out to Hull House tonight.

837
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:17,379
What?

838
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,980
Look.

839
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:20,582
You see that road?

840
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,717
That goes to Old Hull Road.

841
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:25,387
Somebody took one of
my books, Sister.

842
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:27,522
A book on demonology.

843
00:50:27,523 --> 00:50:28,591
Look at this.

844
00:50:31,794 --> 00:50:34,462
I think they went to Hull House
to perform some kind of ceremony.

845
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:36,598
Who went out there, Perry?

846
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,802
Kurt and Johnny and a
couple of the girls.

847
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:41,937
Melissa.

a little piece of hell... ♪

850
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:19,841
Ow! Hey!

851
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:21,443
What's the big idea?

852
00:51:21,444 --> 00:51:22,510
What's going on?

853
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:23,578
I saw-- You okay?

854
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:26,247
Bibi, what are you doing?
Where did you get this?

855
00:51:26,248 --> 00:51:28,383
Just get rid of it, okay?
Just throw it out the window.

856
00:51:28,384 --> 00:51:29,984
Bibi.

857
00:51:29,985 --> 00:51:32,120
No, it's something that
I found at Hull House.

858
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:33,722
Just throw it out now, okay?

859
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,857
Okay, all right. Calm down.

860
00:51:35,858 --> 00:51:37,460
Wait a minute. Give me that.

861
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:41,197
That's a nice little souvenir.

862
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:44,399
Shirley, I wouldn't
if I were you.

863
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,069
Why, is it gonna bite me?

Oh, yeah.

868
00:51:57,213 --> 00:51:58,813
You all right?

869
00:51:58,814 --> 00:52:03,085
Yeah, I guess I was just a little
more tired than I thought.

870
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:06,287
Melissa?

871
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:08,423
Bibi?

872
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:11,093
Shirley?

00:52:28,177 --> 00:52:29,778
Mouse. Mouse, wait.

874
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,981
I had no idea what
Shirley had planned.

875
00:52:32,982 --> 00:52:35,116
Honest.

876
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:37,253
Hey, it's not your fault.

877
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:42,056
I just hope she'll
be all right.

878
00:52:42,057 --> 00:52:44,726
You want to stop up for a
little trick or treat?

879
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:47,929
Sure, I'll come up for
a little sticky treat.

880
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:48,997
Thank you, Sheriff.

881
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:51,132
I'm sure it's just
a false alarm.

882
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:55,938
One of our boys has a very
overworked imagination.

883
00:52:58,073 --> 00:52:59,141
Thank you.

884
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:03,945
All right, the sheriff is sending
out one of his deputies.

885
00:53:03,946 --> 00:53:06,614
If our kids are out there,
I'm sure they'll find them.

886
00:53:06,615 --> 00:53:08,216
It could be too late
by then, Father.

887
00:53:08,217 --> 00:53:11,953
Oh, Perry, I've had enough of
your Halloween shenanigans.

888
00:53:11,954 --> 00:53:14,088
Now, you've desecrated
the sacristy,

889
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:15,690
and now, you must admit,

890
00:53:15,691 --> 00:53:18,359
that if any of our kids
did go out to Hull House,

891
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,029
it was one of your ridiculous
books that gave them the idea.

892
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,164
Perhaps we should listen
to the boy, Father.

893
00:53:23,165 --> 00:53:26,367
We should certainly be
thankful for his vigilance.

894
00:53:26,368 --> 00:53:29,037
Well, Sister, there
is a fine line

895
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:31,707
between vigilance and
paranoia, isn't there?

896
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:37,579
Now, if you'll both excuse me,

897
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,714
I've had a rather long day.

898
00:53:39,715 --> 00:53:41,316
I'm going to bed.

899
00:53:41,317 --> 00:53:43,985
Very well, Father.

900
00:53:43,986 --> 00:53:46,655
Come with me, Perry.

901
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:51,460
Hey, Mouse. Mouse, wait.

902
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:55,196
She'll be all right.

903
00:53:55,197 --> 00:53:56,798
We'll talk to her
in the morning.

904
00:53:56,799 --> 00:53:59,467
Whoa, the dance sounds
like it's rockin'.

905
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:01,069
Hey, you guys, check it out.

906
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,204
I don't see Sister
Gory in there.

907
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:06,407
The way the music's blasting,
I bet she had a heart attack.

908
00:54:06,408 --> 00:54:08,544
Yeah, well, let's get a dance
in before she recovers.

909
00:54:11,747 --> 00:54:13,882
You know, I'm not
much into dancing.

910
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,017
Me neither.

911
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:18,686
Hey, Kurt,

912
00:54:18,687 --> 00:54:21,356
is it true they
call you Kingsnake?

913
00:54:21,357 --> 00:54:24,025
Yeah.

914
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:26,160
Hmm.

915
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:29,899

918
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:40,041
Come on, Shirl.

919
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:42,176
Chill. I just want
to hit the head.

920
00:54:42,177 --> 00:54:44,312
Keep my place warm, okay?

921
00:54:44,313 --> 00:54:45,915
It'll be here.

922
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:13,676
Hi there, dollface. You're
looking pretty good tonight.

923
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:16,878
Just one little touch up,

924
00:55:16,879 --> 00:55:18,480
and you'll be queen
of the ball.

925
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:43,572
Let me out!

926
00:55:46,775 --> 00:55:47,842
Oh!

927
00:55:47,843 --> 00:55:51,580
Let me out!

928
00:55:56,385 --> 00:55:58,520
Let me out!

929
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:26,608

00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:01,636
Well, thanks for the dance.

932
00:59:01,637 --> 00:59:03,772
You don't belong here.

933
00:59:27,796 --> 00:59:29,397
Where have you guys been?

934
00:59:29,398 --> 00:59:30,999
What's going on with her?

935
00:59:57,693 --> 00:59:59,293
What's the matter, baby?

936
00:59:59,294 --> 01:00:01,429
Don't you want
your sticky treat?

937
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:04,099
I'll take a little piece
of that, sunshine.

938
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:09,437
Stop this hellishness now!

939
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:11,573
Nice.

940
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:15,843
What are you doing, you freak?
Let go of my hand!

941
01:00:15,844 --> 01:00:18,513
Let go of my hand!

942
01:00:27,055 --> 01:00:28,123
Oh, my God.

943
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:45,207
To the chapel.
Everybody, quickly!

944
01:00:50,545 --> 01:00:52,146
Come on! Hurry! Get
to the chapel!

945
01:00:52,147 --> 01:00:53,214
Let's go.

946
01:00:53,215 --> 01:00:55,350
Come on, let's go!

947
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:00,155
Bibi!

948
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,358
Johnny!

949
01:01:19,374 --> 01:01:20,975
I don't believe this.

950
01:01:20,976 --> 01:01:23,110
Why is it happening here?

951
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:24,178
Oh, God, the lipstick.

952
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:25,246
What lipstick?

953
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:26,847
The lipstick that I brought
from Hull House.

954
01:01:26,848 --> 01:01:28,449
You mean you brought
something out of Hull House?

955
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,517
Be quiet, Perry.

956
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:31,652
But, Sister, don't
you understand?

957
01:01:31,653 --> 01:01:33,254
That lipstick must
be the conveyance

958
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:34,855
that brought the demons out

959
01:01:34,856 --> 01:01:36,457
across the underground streams.

960
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,059
We'll deal with that later.

961
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,728
Johnny, go find Father Bob.

962
01:01:40,729 --> 01:01:43,397
He's got to get over here and
give that boy his last rites.

963
01:01:43,398 --> 01:01:44,999
Satan has taken his body.

964
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,736
Maybe we can save his soul.

965
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:52,473
Bibi, you get over to the chapel and
make sure everyone stays inside.

966
01:01:52,474 --> 01:01:53,541
Okay.

967
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:55,676
Perry, you get over
to the chapel.

968
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:57,278
Where are you going?

969
01:01:57,279 --> 01:01:58,880
To prepare.

970
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:30,911
Don't panic, okay?
One at a time!

971
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:31,979
One at a time.

972
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,649
Terri! Terri!

973
01:02:40,522 --> 01:02:42,123
Bibi! Bibi, are you okay?

974
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:44,258
Johnny!

975
01:02:44,259 --> 01:02:45,326
I can't find Terri.

976
01:02:45,327 --> 01:02:46,394
They're probably inside.

977
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:47,996
Just go inside.
I'll be right back.

978
01:03:07,215 --> 01:03:08,816
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

979
01:03:08,817 --> 01:03:11,485
Come on, you know you
want it as much as I do.

980
01:03:11,486 --> 01:03:13,087
Kurt, we're just
getting acquainted.

981
01:03:13,088 --> 01:03:16,291
Oh, yeah, but I'd like to
get way more acquainted.

982
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:18,959
Okay.

983
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,629
This is as far as I go.

984
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,765
Well, if I have to.

985
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:37,646
Oh, yeah.

986
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:49,924
That feels good.

987
01:03:49,925 --> 01:03:50,991
Mm-hmm.

988
01:03:50,992 --> 01:03:52,594
Oh...

989
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:57,398
Well, slow down, now.

990
01:03:57,399 --> 01:03:59,533
You don't want to
strike oil too soon.

991
01:03:59,534 --> 01:04:02,204
Hey, hey. Calm down, will you?

992
01:04:07,542 --> 01:04:08,610
Oh, shit!

993
01:04:17,686 --> 01:04:20,888
What a healthy,
strapping young buck.

994
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:22,491
How's about a
little head, tiger?

995
01:04:42,777 --> 01:04:43,844
Oh, my God.

996
01:04:43,845 --> 01:04:45,980
Oh, my God. Shirley.

997
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,115
The most horrible
thing has happened.

998
01:04:48,116 --> 01:04:49,717
It was Kurt! It was--

999
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:52,386
It's not so horrible.

1000
01:04:52,387 --> 01:04:53,988
Oh, my God!

1001
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:55,056
What?

1002
01:04:56,124 --> 01:04:57,726
Shirley, what are you--

1003
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:12,673
Father Bob, wake up!

1004
01:05:12,674 --> 01:05:14,808
Wake up, Father!

1005
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:16,410
What?

1006
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:17,478
What is it?

1007
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:18,547
It's an emergency! Hurry!

1008
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:22,816
All right, well, give
me a couple of minutes.

1009
01:05:22,817 --> 01:05:26,020
Please, Sister
Gloria needs you!

1010
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:28,690
All right.

1011
01:05:31,893 --> 01:05:34,028
Don't cry, little one!

1012
01:05:34,029 --> 01:05:37,231
I'm back, and I'm gonna
take good care of you now.

1013
01:05:37,232 --> 01:05:38,832
Angela?

1014
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:43,103
No, you can't be here.

1015
01:05:43,104 --> 01:05:44,705
You died.

1016
01:05:44,706 --> 01:05:45,773
No, I didn't.

1017
01:05:45,774 --> 01:05:47,908
I'm dreaming.

1018
01:05:47,909 --> 01:05:49,510
I'm just dreaming again.

1019
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:51,111
No, you're not.

1020
01:05:51,112 --> 01:05:52,713
It is me, Mouse.

1021
01:05:52,714 --> 01:05:56,450
I'm flesh and blood
just like you, see?

1022
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:58,053
I'm your flesh and blood.

1023
01:06:00,188 --> 01:06:02,323
Listen, Mouse, I was so scared

1024
01:06:02,324 --> 01:06:04,992
after what happened at
my Halloween party.

1025
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:06,594
I had to run away.

1026
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:09,797
I just couldn't
face Mom and Dad.

1027
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:12,466
I knew you were miserable
when they passed on.

1028
01:06:12,467 --> 01:06:15,135
You must have been so lonely.

1029
01:06:15,136 --> 01:06:18,872
Oh, Angela, it was so,
so lonely without you.

1030
01:06:18,873 --> 01:06:19,940
Oh, it's okay now.

1031
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:23,143
My little Mouse.

1032
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:27,948
I've come to take you away
with me to a wonderful place

1033
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:30,084
where you'll never
be lonely again.

1034
01:06:30,085 --> 01:06:32,753
I have lots of
great friends now.

1035
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:35,422
They were all lonely once,

1036
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:37,025
just like you.

1037
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,296
You still love me,
don't you, Mouse?

1038
01:06:44,499 --> 01:06:48,770
Oh, Ang, I missed you so much.

1039
01:06:54,109 --> 01:06:56,243
All right, children,
stay calm.

1040
01:06:56,244 --> 01:06:57,311
What's that?

1041
01:06:57,312 --> 01:06:58,912
Holy artillery.

1042
01:06:58,913 --> 01:06:59,980
Do you have one for me?

1043
01:06:59,981 --> 01:07:02,116
Sister Gloria, I'd
like an explanation.

1044
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:03,717
Did you give him the
last rites, Father?

1045
01:07:03,718 --> 01:07:04,785
Give the last rites
to whom, Sister?

1046
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:06,387
Rick's body was gone.

1047
01:07:06,388 --> 01:07:07,454
Gone?

1048
01:07:07,455 --> 01:07:10,124
Bibi! Where's Bibi?

1049
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:12,259
Sister Gloria, why are
you wearing that habit?

1050
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,861
I have an Uzi, Sister,

1051
01:07:13,862 --> 01:07:15,996
holy water filled balloons--
What are you talking about?

1052
01:07:15,997 --> 01:07:17,599
An Uzi? Six rosaries,
a cross...

1053
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:35,750
Mouse?

1054
01:07:52,834 --> 01:07:56,037
Why do you want Mouse
when you can have me?

1055
01:08:02,977 --> 01:08:04,579
Bibi!

1056
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:14,189
Hold her.

1057
01:08:16,324 --> 01:08:17,926
Pour it down her throat.

1058
01:08:45,153 --> 01:08:46,755
Touchè.

1059
01:08:50,492 --> 01:08:51,558
Take her to the chapel.

1060
01:08:51,559 --> 01:08:53,160
She's gonna be all right.

1061
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:54,763
Let's go.

1062
01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:58,500
Melissa?

1063
01:09:02,237 --> 01:09:03,304
Melissa?

1064
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:07,574
Sister Gloria!

1065
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:09,711
Come here, look!

1066
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:18,252
Things are gonna be so
good for us now, Mouse.

1067
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:20,388
Just you and me, the way it
always should have been.

1068
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:23,057
Time to go.

1069
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:26,261
Well, you coming or not?

1070
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:40,140
Sister Gloria, would you please tell
me what is happening around here?

1071
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:41,742
I can't find Kurt anywhere.

1072
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:44,411
The demons have escaped from Hull
House and they've kidnapped Mouse.

1073
01:09:44,412 --> 01:09:45,479
Oh, Perry, don't start.

1074
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,080
Now, I warned you
once tonight--

1075
01:09:47,081 --> 01:09:48,682
But he's right, Father.

1076
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:51,351
I have seen Satan's work
tonight with my own eyes.

1077
01:09:51,352 --> 01:09:54,021
Look, I cannot believe
I am hearing this.

1078
01:09:54,022 --> 01:09:55,622
Sister Gloria, come here.

1079
01:09:55,623 --> 01:09:58,292
Now, I expect this
nonsense from the kids,

1080
01:09:58,293 --> 01:10:00,427
but you are supposed
to be a role model.

1081
01:10:00,428 --> 01:10:03,097
Father, look at the statue.

1082
01:10:04,699 --> 01:10:06,301
Oh, no.

1083
01:10:07,902 --> 01:10:09,503
Now do you believe me?

1084
01:10:09,504 --> 01:10:11,104
What?

1085
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:14,308
Ugh. Perry, someone
vandalized the statue.

1086
01:10:14,309 --> 01:10:16,443
There are none so
blind, Father, as--

1087
01:10:16,444 --> 01:10:20,714
Oh, Perry, there are none so
annoyed as I am right now.

1088
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:22,316
First of all, I get
dragged out of my bed

1089
01:10:22,317 --> 01:10:24,451
with a story about a boy
needing the last rites,

1090
01:10:24,452 --> 01:10:26,053
and now this.

1091
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:27,654
Where do you think
you're going?

1092
01:10:27,655 --> 01:10:29,256
To Hull House.

1093
01:10:29,257 --> 01:10:31,391
Somebody's gotta save Mouse.

1094
01:10:31,392 --> 01:10:32,459
Not you.

1095
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,527
Perry's right. I'm going, too.

1096
01:10:33,528 --> 01:10:35,128
It's my fault she's there.

1097
01:10:35,129 --> 01:10:37,798
You don't know what
we're dealing with.

1098
01:10:37,799 --> 01:10:39,933
Oh, come on! We're
losing time.

1099
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:41,535
Father, give me the car keys.

1100
01:10:41,536 --> 01:10:45,272
You are not setting foot
off these school grounds.

1101
01:10:45,273 --> 01:10:47,941
Now wait a minute,
Sister Gloria.

1102
01:10:47,942 --> 01:10:50,611
If they want to go, I think
we should let them.

1103
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:52,746
In fact, we'll all go.

1104
01:10:52,747 --> 01:10:55,415
And by the time this
evening is over,

1105
01:10:55,416 --> 01:10:57,017
the legend of Hull House

1106
01:10:57,018 --> 01:10:58,619
will be laid to rest forever.

1107
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,221
Let's go.

1108
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:23,711
Well, let's go in.
Get it over with.

1109
01:11:25,313 --> 01:11:27,981
And after we put an end
to this absurd prank,

1110
01:11:27,982 --> 01:11:30,117
we'll deal with whoever
instigated it.

1111
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:32,786
Father, I thought the sheriff was
supposed to send somebody out here.

1112
01:11:32,787 --> 01:11:34,922
Perry, I'm sure they've
come and gone.

1113
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:38,125
Come and gone? They probably didn't
get past the Donut King back in town.

1114
01:11:38,126 --> 01:11:40,260
They couldn't help us.

1115
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:42,396
Not tonight.

1116
01:11:42,397 --> 01:11:44,532
Not in this place.

1117
01:12:03,217 --> 01:12:04,284
Melissa?

1118
01:12:04,285 --> 01:12:06,420
Melissa, are you here?

1119
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:08,555
Shh! Perry, please.

1120
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:10,158
This way.

1121
01:12:13,361 --> 01:12:14,962
Whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.

1122
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:18,165
I agreed to take you all out
here on this wild goose chase,

1123
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:21,902
but I will not spend all night traipsing
around some dusty old mansion.

1124
01:12:21,903 --> 01:12:24,037
Now if Melissa's here,

1125
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:27,240
we will find her much more
quickly by splitting up.

1126
01:12:27,241 --> 01:12:28,842
We must stick together.

1127
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:30,978
This house is a
portal to hell.

1128
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,045
Thanks, Sister.

1129
01:12:32,046 --> 01:12:34,715
I really needed to know that.

1130
01:12:34,716 --> 01:12:38,987
Well, I'm going this way.
Who's coming with me?

1131
01:12:41,122 --> 01:12:44,859
Fine. I'll see you
all back at the van.

1132
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,595
I'm gonna go with him.

1133
01:12:48,596 --> 01:12:51,265
Somebody has to protect
him from himself.

1134
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:20,093
What? Shh.

1135
01:13:20,094 --> 01:13:21,696
It's close.

1136
01:13:27,568 --> 01:13:28,636
What the hell?

1137
01:13:41,449 --> 01:13:43,050
Where did it go?

1138
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:45,186
Come along.

1139
01:13:56,397 --> 01:13:57,998
What happened?

1140
01:13:57,999 --> 01:13:59,599
It's nothing.

1141
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,201
Nothing? We just saw--
It's the house.

1142
01:14:01,202 --> 01:14:04,405
The house is trying
to deceive us.

1143
01:14:09,744 --> 01:14:11,344
Bibi!

1144
01:14:11,345 --> 01:14:12,946
Johnny!

1145
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:14,015
Bibi!

1146
01:14:24,692 --> 01:14:26,293
Johnny!

1147
01:14:26,294 --> 01:14:28,429
Sister Gloria?

1148
01:14:56,724 --> 01:14:58,325
What's that?

1149
01:14:58,326 --> 01:14:59,926
Relax, Perry.

1150
01:14:59,927 --> 01:15:02,062
I've heard the devil
described in many ways,

1151
01:15:02,063 --> 01:15:04,731
but never with a squeak.

1152
01:15:04,732 --> 01:15:06,333
Oh, my God!

1153
01:15:06,334 --> 01:15:07,934
There's your devil for ya.

1154
01:15:07,935 --> 01:15:11,138
He seems to have left his pitchfork
down in Hell, didn't he?

1155
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,205
Father, that's the guy.

1156
01:15:12,206 --> 01:15:13,273
Hey, hold it right there!

1157
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:14,875
Perry, that's enough.

1158
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:15,942
No, Father, I need that!

1159
01:15:15,943 --> 01:15:19,146
I don't want to hear it!

1160
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,213
Well, hello, Father.

1161
01:15:20,214 --> 01:15:21,815
Good evening, son.

1162
01:15:21,816 --> 01:15:25,552
Having a little Halloween fun here
at Hull House tonight, are you?

1163
01:15:25,553 --> 01:15:27,687
Oh, yeah.

1164
01:15:27,688 --> 01:15:30,891
Father, I have something
to confess to you.

1165
01:15:30,892 --> 01:15:32,492
Would you like to
hear my confession?

1166
01:15:32,493 --> 01:15:34,094
What? Now?

1167
01:15:34,095 --> 01:15:37,298
I broke the fifth commandment.

1168
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,967
The fifth?

1169
01:15:44,772 --> 01:15:46,373
Thou shalt not kill.

1170
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:48,508
You killed someone?

1171
01:15:48,509 --> 01:15:51,178
Yes, Father.

1172
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,313
You.

1173
01:15:53,314 --> 01:15:55,449
Get out of here, Father! Run!

1174
01:15:56,517 --> 01:15:59,719
I'm heartily sorry
for offending thee,

1175
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,855
and I detest all of my sins,

1176
01:16:01,856 --> 01:16:03,456
for I dread the loss of Heaven

1177
01:16:03,457 --> 01:16:05,593
and the pain of Hell!

1178
01:16:24,278 --> 01:16:25,346
Father?

1179
01:16:26,948 --> 01:16:28,549
Father...

1180
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:38,485
Kurt?

1181
01:17:38,486 --> 01:17:39,553
Is that you?

1182
01:17:42,223 --> 01:17:43,823
Hey, J-boy.

1183
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:45,960
Heads up. Want to
shoot some hoop?

1184
01:17:49,697 --> 01:17:51,831
He's dribbling down the court.
No one's near him!

1185
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:53,433
He's got 10 seconds left.
He's going around.

1186
01:17:53,434 --> 01:17:56,102
Larry Bird shoots.
Nothing but net!

1187
01:17:56,103 --> 01:17:58,238
He's racking up the
points tonight.

1188
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,908
Larry Bird's in the air.
Nothing but net!

1189
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:11,585
Uh-uh! Penalty for traveling.

1190
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:19,059
Hey, buddy boy, I thought
you'd be happy to see me.

1191
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,728
Well, if you're not,
I can fix that, too.

1192
01:18:21,729 --> 01:18:24,397
No! Kurt, please!

1193
01:18:24,398 --> 01:18:25,999
Kurt's not here right now.

1194
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,601
- 2 points!
- Time out, Kurt.

1195
01:18:37,745 --> 01:18:38,812
Oh, where's a ref
when you need one?

1196
01:18:38,813 --> 01:18:40,413
Technical foul.

1197
01:18:40,414 --> 01:18:42,015
Wrong! Field goal!

1198
01:18:42,016 --> 01:18:44,150
Oof!

1199
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:45,219
Ah!

1200
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:48,421
Come on, Johnny, let's go.

1201
01:18:48,422 --> 01:18:49,622
Where's Father Bob? Don't ask.

1202
01:19:15,116 --> 01:19:16,717
Batter up.

1203
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,522
Come on, toughie. Come on.

1204
01:19:23,124 --> 01:19:24,725
Strike.

1205
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:32,198
Perry...

1206
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:34,334
You saved my life, man.

1207
01:19:34,335 --> 01:19:35,936
Jesus.

1208
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,206
Holy water.

1209
01:19:40,207 --> 01:19:43,411
John, please.

1210
01:19:48,749 --> 01:19:50,885
Hang on, Perry.

1211
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:55,689
Come on, man.

1212
01:20:03,164 --> 01:20:05,298
John...

1213
01:20:05,299 --> 01:20:08,501
Do you remember the
story of Abraham?

1214
01:20:08,502 --> 01:20:12,772
Willing to prove his devotion to the
Lord by sacrificing his own son,

1215
01:20:12,773 --> 01:20:14,908
his own flesh and blood.

1216
01:20:14,909 --> 01:20:17,578
I think that's Angela's plan.

1217
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:22,382
I think she's
gonna kill Mouse.

1218
01:20:22,383 --> 01:20:26,653
Please, John, save Melissa.

1219
01:20:26,654 --> 01:20:27,654
Please.

1220
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:31,991
Perry!

1221
01:20:31,992 --> 01:20:34,128
Perry...

1222
01:20:35,196 --> 01:20:36,797
Perry.

1223
01:21:34,989 --> 01:21:36,590
Boo!

1224
01:21:38,192 --> 01:21:40,326
Why, little miss prom queen.

1225
01:21:40,327 --> 01:21:42,996
I've got a little something
special right here for you, baby.

1226
01:21:42,997 --> 01:21:46,200
Woo hoo ha ha!

1227
01:21:50,471 --> 01:21:53,140
I'll give you a ride you'd
never forget, baby.

1228
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:56,343
I like a rich bitch. No!

1229
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:01,147
No!

1230
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:03,816
Bitch.

1231
01:22:03,817 --> 01:22:05,953
When you say no,
I know you mean yes.

1232
01:22:08,088 --> 01:22:11,292
Leave a little room
for the Holy Ghost.

1233
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:15,028
I don't think so.

1234
01:22:15,029 --> 01:22:16,096
Hi-ya!

1235
01:22:20,367 --> 01:22:21,435
Hi-ya!

1236
01:22:27,308 --> 01:22:28,375
Ah!

1237
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:40,120
Spare the rod and
spoil the child.

1238
01:22:50,264 --> 01:22:51,331
Father Bob?

1239
01:22:51,332 --> 01:22:52,932
Oh, thank God.

1240
01:22:52,933 --> 01:22:54,000
Have you found Mouse?

1241
01:22:54,001 --> 01:22:56,135
Oh, yes, I know
just where she is.

1242
01:22:56,136 --> 01:22:57,738
Come, I'll take you to her!

1243
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:05,212
Blessed are the hopeless!

1244
01:23:08,415 --> 01:23:11,084
The heirs of the Kingdom...

1245
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:12,151
of Hell!

1246
01:23:12,152 --> 01:23:13,754
Ah!

1247
01:23:21,228 --> 01:23:22,830
Agh!

1248
01:24:01,802 --> 01:24:03,403
Well, well.

1249
01:24:03,404 --> 01:24:04,470
Look out!

1250
01:24:04,471 --> 01:24:05,539
Let's party here.

1251
01:24:21,021 --> 01:24:22,623
Let's go.

1252
01:24:34,902 --> 01:24:36,503
Melissa?

1253
01:24:43,444 --> 01:24:45,044
Welcome.

1254
01:24:45,045 --> 01:24:49,849
I'm so glad you could join us
on this very special occasion.

1255
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:52,518
Oh, we really can't stay.

1256
01:24:52,519 --> 01:24:54,654
We've just come for Melissa.

1257
01:24:54,655 --> 01:24:56,789
We're taking her home with us.

1258
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:58,925
Melissa?

1259
01:24:58,926 --> 01:25:02,128
Oh, you mean Mouse.

1260
01:25:02,129 --> 01:25:04,797
Well, I'm afraid you're
mistaken about that.

1261
01:25:04,798 --> 01:25:07,467
You see, Mouse is home,

1262
01:25:07,468 --> 01:25:09,068
and so are you.

1263
01:25:09,069 --> 01:25:11,204
Or hadn't you figured
that out yet?

1264
01:25:11,205 --> 01:25:14,407
This place is not a home.

1265
01:25:14,408 --> 01:25:16,542
Oh, but it is.

1266
01:25:16,543 --> 01:25:19,212
That's why I let you make
it all the way up here

1267
01:25:19,213 --> 01:25:21,347
to the inner sanctum,

1268
01:25:21,348 --> 01:25:24,017
the very threshold
of infinity.

1269
01:25:44,304 --> 01:25:47,507
A river of holy water
wouldn't help you now.

1270
01:25:47,508 --> 01:25:50,710
Abandon all hope.

1271
01:25:50,711 --> 01:25:51,778
Close shave, Angela.

1272
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:52,845
Huh?

1273
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:54,981
But no cigar.

1274
01:25:54,982 --> 01:25:56,048
Sister?

1275
01:25:56,049 --> 01:25:59,786
You think I need holy
water to beat you?

1276
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:02,455
I've got all that
I need right here.

1277
01:26:02,456 --> 01:26:05,658
It's a little thing
called faith.

1278
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:06,726
Faith?

1279
01:26:06,727 --> 01:26:09,929
Your faith is a joke.

1280
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:13,132
Real faith can move mountains.

1281
01:26:13,133 --> 01:26:16,870
Your faith can't
even move a mouse.

1282
01:26:27,014 --> 01:26:30,750
If you really have
faith, prove it.

1283
01:26:30,751 --> 01:26:34,487
Trade places with her.

1284
01:26:34,488 --> 01:26:35,555
No, Sister, don't.
It's a trick.

1285
01:26:35,556 --> 01:26:39,292
Your life for theirs.

1286
01:26:39,293 --> 01:26:43,030
Come on, Sister.
Kick the habit.

1287
01:26:44,631 --> 01:26:46,766
Let them go and I'll do it.

1288
01:26:46,767 --> 01:26:47,767
Don't do it, Sister.

1289
01:26:53,707 --> 01:26:57,443
Mouse, her soul
has great power.

1290
01:26:57,444 --> 01:27:01,180
You will have all that power
if you chop off her head.

1291
01:27:01,181 --> 01:27:02,783
No!

1292
01:27:05,452 --> 01:27:07,054
Johnny!

1293
01:27:09,723 --> 01:27:11,324
Don't fuck with me, kid.

1294
01:27:11,325 --> 01:27:12,926
Bitch!

1295
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,070
You have to earn
your power, Mouse.

1296
01:27:30,544 --> 01:27:33,212
Melissa...

1297
01:27:33,213 --> 01:27:34,281
remember your faith.

1298
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:38,551
Now.

1299
01:27:38,552 --> 01:27:40,686
I order you.

1300
01:27:40,687 --> 01:27:43,357
I order you to kill her.

1301
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:49,229
Kill her!

1302
01:27:50,831 --> 01:27:52,966
Now, Mouse.

1303
01:27:55,636 --> 01:27:56,702
Do it.

1304
01:27:56,703 --> 01:27:58,305
Now, Mouse!

1305
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:08,448
No!

1306
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,923
My name is Melissa.

1307
01:28:18,592 --> 01:28:20,193
You bitch!

1308
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:23,931
Say your prayers.

1309
01:29:05,038 --> 01:29:06,106
Let's get out of here.

1310
01:29:15,182 --> 01:29:16,782
This room wasn't here before.

1311
01:29:16,783 --> 01:29:18,384
No, it wasn't.

1312
01:29:18,385 --> 01:29:19,986
The house won't let us leave!

1313
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:22,122
Here, let's try these windows.

1314
01:29:39,206 --> 01:29:40,806
Angela.

1315
01:29:40,807 --> 01:29:44,543
Where are you going? The
party's just begun.

1316
01:29:44,544 --> 01:29:46,679
Oh, my God!

1317
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,815
Here's a little taste of hell.

1318
01:29:55,756 --> 01:29:57,357
Run!

1319
01:30:11,238 --> 01:30:13,373
Do something!

1320
01:30:27,788 --> 01:30:29,389
Johnny!

1321
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:33,126
Oh!

1322
01:30:38,999 --> 01:30:40,600
I hate you!

1323
01:31:55,876 --> 01:31:58,011
Let's go home, children.

1324
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:18,297
Sister Gloria, are you okay?

1325
01:32:18,298 --> 01:32:19,365
Yes, we're all right.

1326
01:32:19,366 --> 01:32:20,967
We're all right, children.

1327
01:32:22,569 --> 01:32:24,170
Where's Perry?

1328
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:25,772
What happened?

1329
01:32:29,509 --> 01:32:33,780
Everything is going
to be all right.
