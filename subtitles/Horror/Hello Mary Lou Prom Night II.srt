1
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:54,966
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

2
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:59,434
It has been three months
since my last confession.

3
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:04,603
I've disobeyed my parents many times.

4
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:10,810
I've taken the Lord's name in vain.
Many times.

5
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:17,258
I've had sinful relations with boys
at my school.

6
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:19,724
Many boys.

7
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:22,124
Many times.

8
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,824
My child, these are great sins.

9
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:29,628
You must prepare yourself
for the consequences.

10
00:03:29,904 --> 00:03:33,032
Father, there's one more thing.

11
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,199
What is it, my poor child?

12
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:37,636
I loved every minute of it.

13
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:48,785
<i>Tutti frutti</i>
<i>All over rootie</i>

14
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,964
<i>I got a girl named Sue</i>

15
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:06,504
<i>She knows just what to do</i>

16
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:09,407
<i>I got a girl named Sue</i>

17
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:11,741
<i>She knows just what to do</i>

18
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:14,841
<i>She rock to the east</i>
<i>She rock to the west</i>

<i>I got a girl named Daisy</i>

22
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,467
Thanks for the ring, Billy. It's really cool.

23
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,065
You look really beautiful tonight,
Mary Lou.

24
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:42,302
Really?

25
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:44,242
Could you get me
a glass of punch, please?

26
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,904
Sure. Don't go away.

27
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,208
I won't.

28
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,311
<i>Tutti frutti</i>
<i>All over rootie</i>

29
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,970
Hey, Nordham, neat prom, huh?

30
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,573
Yeah. Have you seen Mary Lou?

31
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:30,550
She went behind the stage with Cooper.

32
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:35,586
- When'd you guys break up, anyway?
- We didn't.

33
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,560
Bud Cooper strikes again.

34
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:44,296
What do you go out
with that square for anyway?

35
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:46,764
'Cause he treats me right.

36
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:51,868
And his daddy's rich.
Rich enough to make Billy cool.

37
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:55,414
So why do you go out with me?

38
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:59,078
Because it's a big free country.

39
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:02,923
God bless America.

40
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:04,986
You shit!

41
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:06,617
Hey, Nordham.

42
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:10,063
Be cool, Billy. We weren't doing anything.

43
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,758
Speak for yourself.

44
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,824
We've been petting for a year
and you never went this far.

45
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:17,962
A year! You want to shake?
It's just as close as you're gonna get.

46
00:06:25,113 --> 00:06:27,081
<i>Tutti frutti</i>

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

48
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:52,332
You came with me.

49
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:55,772
It's not who you come with,
it's who takes you home.

50
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:57,304
Scram!

51
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:02,008
See you later, alligator.

52
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:06,078
- How much did you put in?
- Enough.

53
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:08,452
It'll stink up the whole place.

54
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,192
Romero's coming! Hide the stink bomb.

55
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,940
Enjoying the prom?

56
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:36,544
Not much. You?

57
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,014
The music's too loud.
This rock and roll will never last.

58
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:53,398
Well, it's time to announce
the prom queen for 1957 at Hamilton High.

59
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:04,235
The winner is... Drum roll, please.

60
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:10,017
Mary Lou Maloney!

61
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:13,317
<i>She took my diamond ring</i>

62
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,251
<i>She took my watch and chain</i>

63
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:20,152
<i>She took the keys</i>
<i>to my Cadillac car</i>

64
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:23,755
<i>Jumped in my kitty</i>
<i>and she drove a-far</i>

65
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:39,903
All right, let's hear it
for Mary Lou Maloney,

66
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:43,439
the 1957 Hamilton High Prom Queen.

67
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:49,423
Never mind the stupid cape, bonehead.
Just give me the crown.

68
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:52,516
<i>Told me she was sorry</i>
<i>that she hurt me so</i>

69
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:56,757
<i>I had a '55 Ford</i>
<i>and a $2 bill</i>

70
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,267
<i>When she took a-that, a-man,</i>
<i>it gave me a chill</i>

71
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:03,666
<i>She took my diamond ring</i>

72
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:07,370
<i>She took my watch and chain</i>

73
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,311
<i>She took the keys</i>
<i>to my Cadillac car</i>

74
00:09:11,446 --> 00:09:14,472
<i>Jumped in my kitty</i>
<i>and she drove a-far</i>

75
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:17,382
<i>Well, she jumped in my</i>
<i>kitty and she drove a-far</i>

76
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:35,331
Somebody help her!

77
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:51,010
Mary Lou! Somebody help her!

78
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:06,489
Dear Lord, bless this food
we are about to receive.

79
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:11,164
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

80
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,667
I'll be late after school today.

81
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:25,644
I'm going to go the mall to buy
a new dress for the prom. Okay?

82
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,639
What's wrong with your green one?

83
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:29,944
Nothing.

84
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:32,150
It's just...

85
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:34,416
It's the senior prom, Mom.

86
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,516
Only happens once.

87
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:41,092
I suppose you're still going
with that Craig Nordham.

88
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:44,026
Will he be getting a sidecar
for his motorcycle?

89
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:46,328
Or will you be taking the bus?

90
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:49,468
How much do you think you'll need?

91
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:51,505
She won't need anything.

92
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,566
I still co-sign the checks.

93
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,275
Your green one will be just fine.

94
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:08,778
There's Craig.

95
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:12,422
Bye, Daddy. Bye, Mother.

96
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:17,756
Some punk on a motorcycle
and she jumps for him.

97
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,927
It's young love. Remember?

98
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:25,871
I guess not.

99
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,500
Good morning, prom queen.

100
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:33,177
Hey, your mother's gonna find out
when you win.

101
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,943
I'm only nominated. I'm not the winner.

102
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,312
Not yet.

103
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:42,489
I got my tux.

104
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:44,953
I got my green dress.

105
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:46,653
Didn't work, huh?

106
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,519
Daddy was okay, but you know Mother.

107
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:02,940
- That stuff will kill you.
- Really?

108
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:13,350
- What's this?
- Open it.

109
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:15,016
Go ahead.

110
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,150
It's beautiful.

111
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:25,293
I love it. Thank you.
My mother will never believe this.

112
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:29,199
- More coffee?
- Oh, no, thank you.

113
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:35,373
I love you.

114
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:44,006
Is it a fruit?

115
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:47,343
No. Is it a vegetable?

116
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:50,122
No. It's a radio.

117
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:54,219
Yes. When I began this experiment,
they laughed.

118
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:56,722
Just as you're laughing now!

119
00:13:56,864 --> 00:14:00,800
They said, "Josh, Josh, a potato?
It'll never work."

120
00:14:00,868 --> 00:14:03,701
- He likes you. It is so obvious.
Use something conventional.

121
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,534
Something proven. A kiwi.
- Forget it. He's a jerk.

122
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:07,096
A mango.
- He dresses like a wino.

123
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:09,267
I wanted something radical.

124
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,769
So I developed a guacamole radio.

125
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:14,679
But that was no good.
All I could pick up was stations in Mexico.

126
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:17,650
Well, you can't go alone.
It's the senior prom.

127
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:20,983
The potato! The potato.

128
00:14:21,989 --> 00:14:26,016
Nature's perfect vegetable.
Rich in AM, FM and carbohydrates.

129
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,857
Josh, please, I'm sure Einstein
didn't take this much time.

130
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:32,729
Mr. Craven, boys and girls,

131
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,464
this moment will be inserted
into the annals of scientific history.

132
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:40,632
And I think we all know
how painful that can be.

133
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:42,940
It's alive.

134
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,740
All right,
everybody. Just keep it down to a dull roar.

135
00:14:46,814 --> 00:14:51,012
I can't believe this. I'm 18.
And I'm stunningly good-looking.

136
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:55,119
The prom is like a week away,
and I don't have a date.

137
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:58,750
Excuse me, Monica.
Could I speak to you after school?

138
00:14:58,826 --> 00:15:00,487
Get lost, asshole.

139
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:03,590
So why don't guys ask me out?

140
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:34,057
Wednesday.

141
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:39,897
Thank you.

142
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:42,532
- You forgot breakfast.
- Morning.

143
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:47,699
What do I have to do, hire a nanny when
you go to college to make sure you eat?

144
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:50,005
Hey, Dad. About college...

145
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:52,937
I got a copy of your paperwork.

146
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,243
They've got you in a dormitory
on the north side.

147
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,908
I'm not going to college.

148
00:15:56,984 --> 00:16:00,545
I want to take a year, you know, get a job.
Live my life.

149
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:04,151
- You serious?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am, Dad.

150
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,053
All of a sudden you think
you're mature enough to make decisions

151
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:09,959
that are gonna affect the rest of your life.

152
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,966
Well, shit, Dad, I've been going to school
for a hundred years.

153
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:16,059
This frightens me, Craig.

154
00:16:16,136 --> 00:16:18,036
What are you afraid of?

155
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:21,833
I'm afraid you're gonna throw away
your whole future.

156
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:26,403
I'm not going to throw it away, huh?
I just want to juggle it for a while.

157
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:33,910
Hey, look, I gotta go back to class.

158
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:37,384
Try not to forget to eat lunch.

159
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:39,988
There's no way she's gonna let me
buy a new one.

160
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,621
It's this really ugly green dress.
It makes me sick.

161
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:46,757
- So, what are you gonna wear?
- I don't know yet.

162
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:49,325
I thought I'd take a look at some
old costumes in the prop room, though.

163
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:50,995
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah.

164
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:54,404
Maybe when I get back from the doctor's
I can make something really wild.

165
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:56,909
So, what are you going
to the doctor's for anyway? You okay?

166
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:59,969
Of course, I'm all right.
It's nothing serious.

167
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:03,744
It's just some dumb checkup.
My mom makes me go every year.

168
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:06,786
- Okay, see you.
- Okay, see you.

169
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,048
Vicki?

170
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:12,481
See you later.

171
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:17,391
I have to tell you guys about my dress!
Oh, it is awesome. It is totally awesome.

172
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:20,558
It's... It's sort of Spanish.

173
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,670
And it's red with, like,
black polka dots all over it.

174
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:27,206
And it's got this bow on one shoulder.

175
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:31,768
And the lady at Sears said
it's the same dress

176
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,336
that Liz Taylor wore to the Oscars.

177
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:40,718
I am going to look so hot.

178
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:05,610
Bill.

179
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:26,570
- So, everything's okay, right?
- Yes.

180
00:22:27,908 --> 00:22:29,341
Shit.

181
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:35,110
You really wanna use this stuff
for our prom?

182
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:37,650
It's very classy, real glass.

183
00:22:40,254 --> 00:22:43,621
1957 was not a good year for capes.

184
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:46,221
Wasn't that the year the prom queen
died in the fire?

185
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:50,093
Nice touch, Vicki.
The last person that wore this stuff died.

186
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:54,866
Oh, I really hope you win, Kelly.

187
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,672
Well, you'd better clean that crap off
if you expect me to wear it.

188
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:02,368
Who gives a shit?

189
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:07,671
Jess?

190
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:29,626
Hi.

191
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:31,828
Hi.

192
00:23:42,683 --> 00:23:44,150
What's wrong?

193
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,146
Nothing.

194
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:52,084
Jess.

195
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:06,536
There's...

196
00:24:07,307 --> 00:24:09,036
There's this guy...

197
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:14,007
You know, and I really liked him.

198
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:17,539
And I thought he really liked me.

199
00:24:18,352 --> 00:24:19,546
And I...

200
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:26,084
And I've been trying to call him
and he doesn't answer.

201
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,096
Doesn't answer, and I've left messages,
and he doesn't call me back.

202
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:33,029
He sounds like a jerk.

203
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:38,393
Look, Jess, I mean
if he doesn't call you back, then...

204
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,141
Yeah, I guess I've got
some choices to make.

205
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:49,676
Well, if I were you,
I would choose to forget about this guy.

206
00:24:50,717 --> 00:24:51,809
Yeah.

207
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:55,048
The only problem is, is

208
00:24:55,122 --> 00:24:57,784
he left me something to remember him by.

209
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:00,326
I'm pregnant.

210
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:03,223
Oh, God.

211
00:25:12,906 --> 00:25:14,635
What am I gonna do?

212
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,082
I've finished
cleaning the floors, Jess.

213
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:30,385
I'm going home,
so lock up when you leave.

214
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:31,685
See you.

215
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:46,489
<i>I'm going to tell you</i>
<i>a story about a Mary Lou</i>

216
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:50,024
<i>I mean, the kind of a woman</i>
<i>make a fool of you</i>

217
00:29:09,676 --> 00:29:11,701
- What happened?
- It's Jess.

218
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,408
She killed herself.

219
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:21,145
We can take comfort that she is
with the Lord, resting in a better place.

220
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:26,955
And let the violence of her passing
remind us of the dangers,

221
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:31,795
of the violence we see
so much of every day

222
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:38,095
in our streets, on our television sets
and in the movies.

223
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:57,541
Cute.

224
00:30:59,219 --> 00:31:00,880
What's the matter?

225
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:03,381
I don't know.

226
00:31:03,456 --> 00:31:06,482
It feels weird they decided
to have the prom anyway.

227
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,584
It doesn't seem right without Jess around.

228
00:31:08,661 --> 00:31:10,526
No. On the case,
where everybody can see it.

229
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:12,497
- You got it.
- Hi. How are you doing?

230
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,055
Bell for Kell.

231
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:16,099
I didn't know we could advertise.

232
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:17,636
Don't bother.

233
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:21,673
Oh, that's fine, guys. Just fine.

234
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:25,171
Looks pretty well hung to me.

235
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:28,373
Don't touch the queen.

236
00:31:28,448 --> 00:31:30,643
He'd be the first who didn't.

237
00:31:31,084 --> 00:31:36,181
The competition seems to be dwindling.
You two should take the hint from Jess.

238
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:39,814
You shut your fucking mouth, bitch!

239
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:43,159
All right.
Going to the prom?

240
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:47,489
Ring a bell for Kell. Hi! Ring a bell for Kell.

241
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:53,365
Billy.

242
00:31:58,578 --> 00:32:00,307
Nope. I'm not that desperate.

243
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,574
Still no date.

244
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:03,639
Well, I don't see a line-up
for your company.

245
00:32:03,716 --> 00:32:06,014
Well, I'm planning to go alone.

246
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:09,850
I'm gonna drink too much beer
and throw up in the can.

247
00:32:09,923 --> 00:32:13,359
It's my duty. I'm a teenager.

248
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:21,690
I love you, Mary Lou.

249
00:33:24,731 --> 00:33:26,255
Leave me alone.

250
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:30,057
Don't. No. Leave me alone!

251
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:03,501
This came for you this morning.
Your forms from Western University.

252
00:34:07,273 --> 00:34:09,070
Well, thanks for opening it for me.

253
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:10,803
I beg your pardon.

254
00:34:11,611 --> 00:34:12,942
Sorry.

255
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:20,074
I'm not going.

256
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:24,821
I'm gonna stay home for a year.
Maybe work.

257
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,289
What are you talking about?

258
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,657
- Vicki, is there a problem?
- No.

259
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:32,253
Craig's gonna work for a year
before he goes back to school.

260
00:34:32,332 --> 00:34:34,960
Craig is not the reason
you're going to college.

261
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:39,164
Mother, I'm a senior this year.
I think I can make my own decisions!

262
00:34:39,238 --> 00:34:41,001
Not as long as you live under this roof.

263
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:42,598
Then maybe I should move out right now.

264
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:46,873
Maybe we should all think
about this first and talk after dinner.

265
00:34:55,755 --> 00:35:00,920
Bless us, O Lord, for thy Son,
Jesus Christ's sake, and forgive us...

266
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,555
So, did you get a date for the prom?

267
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:16,465
I didn't either, but I'm still gonna go,

268
00:36:16,536 --> 00:36:19,437
'cause I gotta be there
for the computer vote.

269
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,732
I had this idea.

270
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:27,106
What if we met at the prom, you and I,

271
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,043
and since you're gonna be there,
and I've got to be there anyway...

272
00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:36,714
You and I? At the prom? Together?
No! No way.

273
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:42,690
Well, I guess we could be
at the same place at the same time,

274
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:45,560
- and no one's gonna think anything.
- Yeah?

275
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:50,126
But they might think it's a date
if they saw us kiss or something.

276
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,567
That wouldn't happen.

277
00:36:53,106 --> 00:36:54,630
We better forget it.

278
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:58,040
We might get tempted in the heat of
the moment and sometimes that happens.

279
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:01,171
What if I were to kiss you now

280
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:04,944
and it would be so awful
that we wouldn't be tempted later?

281
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:10,722
Hey, listen, if it's a problem,
we'll just deal with it tomorrow night

282
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,782
under the hot lights
with everyone watching...

283
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:26,234
Is there anything else you wanna
get out of the way?

284
00:37:40,553 --> 00:37:42,282
It's Vicki's serve.

285
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,618
The ball, Kelly.

286
00:38:36,409 --> 00:38:41,403
- Mary Lou. Mary Lou. Mary Lou.
- Mary Lou. Mary Lou. Mary Lou.

287
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,508
- Mary Lou. Mary Lou. Mary Lou.
- Mary Lou. Mary Lou. Mary Lou.

288
00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:57,892
I'm not Mary Lou. I'm not Mary Lou.

289
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,453
No! Mary Lou!

290
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:03,057
I mean, why is it when guys see things,
they get put away?

291
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:06,121
When girls see things,
they get put on <i>Phil Donahue.</i>

292
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:07,859
Are you all right?

293
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,194
I'm fine, Mother.

294
00:40:10,603 --> 00:40:13,697
What happened? The secretary told us
you fainted, you were hurt.

295
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:15,968
Vicki thinks something was...

296
00:40:18,044 --> 00:40:21,104
We were playing volleyball in the gym
and I fainted, that's all.

297
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,909
I probably have the flu or something.

298
00:40:22,982 --> 00:40:25,382
Well, maybe we should take her
to see Dr. Perlzeig.

299
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:29,012
She's not sick. She just needs
to spend time with the Lord.

300
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:32,080
Father Cooper can hear
her confession tonight.

301
00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:35,417
Will you stay for dinner, Craig?

302
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:37,928
Vicki doesn't need guests tonight.

303
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:52,041
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

304
00:40:57,917 --> 00:41:00,545
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

305
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:05,280
I have had sinful thoughts
about my boyfriend.

306
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:08,625
And I've been angry with my mother,

307
00:41:09,362 --> 00:41:13,093
and disobeyed her wishes, and...

308
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:17,568
There's something else.

309
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:21,440
I've been seeing things.

310
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:24,733
Hallucinations about Jess.

311
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:29,471
And Mary Lou Maloney,
that girl who died at our school.

312
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:37,151
Your friend's death hurt us all,

313
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:41,024
but you must always keep self-control.

314
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:46,088
Pray fervently, my child,
to be preserved from all evil.

315
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,097
For your penance,
pray a decade of the rosary now,

316
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:52,569
make an act of contrition now,
and I will give you absolution.

317
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:08,610
Hey, Dad. Dinner's ready.

318
00:42:14,427 --> 00:42:15,587
Right.

319
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,048
Go away.

320
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:25,021
This is my room.

321
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:41,871
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! No! No!

322
00:44:17,116 --> 00:44:18,640
Leave me alone!

323
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:36,101
What's going on in here?

324
00:44:37,336 --> 00:44:40,032
I dropped the radio.

325
00:44:41,206 --> 00:44:42,468
It broke.

326
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:24,809
What do you want?

327
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:43,663
- Vicki.
- Father Cooper.

328
00:45:44,136 --> 00:45:46,263
What are you doing out here?

329
00:45:49,308 --> 00:45:50,639
It's cold.

330
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:52,766
You'd better come with me.

331
00:45:52,845 --> 00:45:55,575
There's something happening
at my school.

332
00:45:56,181 --> 00:45:58,581
Something about Mary Lou Maloney.

333
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:05,380
Do you believe in ghosts?

334
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:08,693
You're tired.

335
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:11,288
It's late, and the mind plays strange tricks.

336
00:46:11,363 --> 00:46:14,799
It's not my mind, God damn you,
it's Mary Lou Maloney!

337
00:46:18,704 --> 00:46:20,035
I'm sorry.

338
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:22,438
Forgive me.

339
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:01,204
Demon, depart.

340
00:47:02,815 --> 00:47:06,307
Be gone! Depart this mortal coil.

341
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,817
The Body of Christ compels you.

342
00:47:10,689 --> 00:47:14,090
The Body of Christ compels you!

343
00:47:15,194 --> 00:47:18,721
The Body of Christ compels you!

344
00:47:19,565 --> 00:47:22,864
The Body of Christ compels you!

345
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:26,895
The Body of Christ compels you!

346
00:47:27,673 --> 00:47:32,235
The Body of Christ compels you!
The Body of Christ compels you!

347
00:47:32,511 --> 00:47:35,036
The Body of Christ compels you!

348
00:48:46,819 --> 00:48:47,808
Hey, Dad, pass me the wrench.

349
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:50,980
There's something wrong
with this goddamn shock.

350
00:48:57,462 --> 00:48:59,259
Sorry, Father Cooper.

351
00:49:29,127 --> 00:49:30,788
- Scotch?
- Please.

352
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:36,201
I'd appreciate a double.

353
00:49:41,206 --> 00:49:42,935
Aren't you on duty?

354
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:46,334
- I'm not a cop.
- What are you, Buddy?

355
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:48,803
Scared.

356
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:50,109
We're in trouble, you and I.

357
00:49:50,182 --> 00:49:51,911
What are you talking about?

358
00:49:51,984 --> 00:49:54,111
Don't jerk me around, Bill.

359
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:56,878
I'm as guilty as you are.

360
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:02,522
She was beautiful, wasn't she?

361
00:50:03,662 --> 00:50:07,962
If she'd jilted me, maybe I would've...

362
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:10,793
Buddy, that was another life.

363
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,263
We're different people now.

364
00:50:14,706 --> 00:50:16,264
So, why don't we forget about it, okay?

365
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:19,103
I wish it was that simple, believe me.

366
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:22,471
Mary Lou Maloney

367
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:26,006
has come back.

368
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,382
Please, listen to this.

369
00:50:31,957 --> 00:50:35,552
"If a person dies violently,
unfulfilled in a life mission,

370
00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:40,326
"the soul wanders purgatory for eternity
waiting for the opportunity to return."

371
00:50:40,399 --> 00:50:41,798
For revenge!

372
00:50:42,234 --> 00:50:44,702
Somehow, her spirit has come back
from the grave,

373
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,635
and she will come after you and me.

374
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:48,468
Jesus Christ, Buddy.

375
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,098
You've been celibate too long.

376
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,769
She can't touch me. I'm a priest.

377
00:50:53,078 --> 00:50:56,980
But she will enter your body
and possess you, her murderer.

378
00:50:57,215 --> 00:50:59,581
You must take communion
to protect yourself!

379
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:00,913
Don't touch me.

380
00:51:00,986 --> 00:51:02,954
For God's sakes, Bill, she's gonna kill you!

381
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:06,081
This, this is the only thing
that will protect you.

382
00:51:06,158 --> 00:51:09,753
I don't need protection from something
that happened 30 years ago.

383
00:51:09,828 --> 00:51:12,854
Now, I've heard enough of this crap.
Get out of my house.

384
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,532
I'm warning you!

385
00:51:23,608 --> 00:51:26,372
Get out of my house. Out!
All right.

386
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:31,649
- You can't shut the door on the past!
- Watch me.

387
00:51:49,601 --> 00:51:51,694
Hey, what? No straitjacket?

388
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,002
- Shit, you look awful.
- Thanks.

389
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:02,180
I'm tired.
I didn't get much sleep last night.

390
00:52:11,156 --> 00:52:12,783
So, are you gonna tell me?

391
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:15,688
- What?
- What's wrong?

392
00:52:18,697 --> 00:52:21,029
- You won't understand.
- Well, why don't you try me, huh?

393
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:23,897
Look, I don't understand it myself, okay?

394
00:52:29,207 --> 00:52:31,471
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

395
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:39,542
I don't know what's real
and what isn't anymore.

396
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:43,515
It's like I'm not in control of myself.

397
00:52:46,691 --> 00:52:49,125
I am afraid I might hurt somebody.

398
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:56,498
God! I might hurt you.

399
00:53:02,174 --> 00:53:03,163
It's okay.

400
00:53:17,456 --> 00:53:19,481
- I wanna talk to you.
- Hey.

401
00:53:19,558 --> 00:53:21,355
- Alone!
- We are alone.

402
00:53:21,726 --> 00:53:23,819
Let me in, Josh.

403
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:26,496
I'll have to frisk you for weapons.

404
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:33,365
Okay, you're not here on a social call.

405
00:53:34,272 --> 00:53:36,604
We don't go to the same parties.

406
00:53:39,144 --> 00:53:43,410
I want you to fix the computer voting.

407
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:45,414
Get serious.

408
00:53:45,784 --> 00:53:47,877
Well, I'm gonna win anyway.

409
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:55,149
But I'll pay you $100 to make sure.

410
00:53:57,028 --> 00:53:59,258
You come down here slumming
to talk to me,

411
00:53:59,331 --> 00:54:02,494
you think you can get me to do
whatever you want.

412
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:04,497
You're right of course, but...

413
00:54:04,569 --> 00:54:06,298
It's very insulting. No!

414
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,630
Come on, Josh.

415
00:54:10,976 --> 00:54:14,912
Look, if that's not enough,
name your price.

416
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,558
You bastard.

417
00:54:29,961 --> 00:54:32,191
Life's a joke. Then you croak.

418
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:44,870
Sorry, big guy.

419
00:54:46,044 --> 00:54:46,942
It's out.

420
00:54:47,012 --> 00:54:50,209
I mean, she was acting really weird,
she was really spaced out, sort of.

421
00:54:50,282 --> 00:54:54,810
And then, she screamed and she fainted,
right in the middle of the gym.

422
00:54:55,887 --> 00:54:58,287
Little Miss Perfect is losing it.

423
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:02,058
Another prom queen hopeful
bites the big one.

424
00:55:02,127 --> 00:55:06,291
Maybe we can take our own seats now,
thank you very much.

425
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:08,327
Thank you very much.

426
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:13,637
Very nice shot. Can we settle now?

427
00:55:14,306 --> 00:55:18,037
Let us begin another wonderful adventure
into the works of William Shakespeare.

428
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:21,704
Here. I found it in my father's underwear
drawer behind Miss September.

429
00:55:22,814 --> 00:55:25,214
What are you looking for, anyway?

430
00:55:28,053 --> 00:55:30,954
I'm sure you'll all recall
Juliet's speech.

431
00:55:38,997 --> 00:55:42,831
- What do you want?
- "Deny thy father and refuse thy name."

432
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:47,403
- Poor Vicki.
- "Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn..."

433
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:48,871
Cracking up?

434
00:55:53,845 --> 00:55:55,005
Vicki!

435
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:12,690
She slugged Kelly?

436
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:16,062
She's stuck in detention until 5:00.
She said you should just go home.

437
00:56:16,134 --> 00:56:17,897
Well, what were they fighting about?

438
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:20,335
I don't know.
Vicki's been acting strange all day.

439
00:56:20,405 --> 00:56:21,838
Is she sick or something?

440
00:56:21,906 --> 00:56:24,374
Maybe she's possessed.

441
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:27,771
Your mother sews socks in hell,
Father Karras.

442
00:56:28,346 --> 00:56:30,576
You know, there could be
a lot of advantages

443
00:56:30,649 --> 00:56:33,083
in a girl whose head spins around.

444
00:56:33,685 --> 00:56:37,086
Your parents did a lot of acid
before they had you.

445
00:56:44,362 --> 00:56:46,193
Just leave it in the office.

446
00:59:07,939 --> 00:59:11,773
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

447
00:59:12,577 --> 00:59:15,808
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

448
00:59:17,615 --> 00:59:19,742
I have done terrible things.

449
00:59:22,754 --> 00:59:24,779
I have hurt my friends.

450
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:30,017
I have given in to sexual desires
with my boyfriend.

451
00:59:31,996 --> 00:59:34,521
I don't know what's happening to me.

452
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:40,265
We all stray from the path of the Lord
sometimes, child.

453
00:59:41,005 --> 00:59:44,065
But with penance,
you will find your way again.

454
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:48,645
- Will you help me, Father?
- Of course, child.

455
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,113
- Will you pray for me?
- Yes.

456
00:59:55,353 --> 00:59:56,980
Will you fuck me?

457
01:00:00,091 --> 01:00:01,854
Come on, Buddy.

458
01:00:02,193 --> 01:00:05,890
It's a big free country.

459
01:00:08,299 --> 01:00:09,664
Right, Buddy?

460
01:00:09,734 --> 01:00:10,962
Dear God!

461
01:00:30,989 --> 01:00:32,320
Be gone.

462
01:00:35,894 --> 01:00:37,987
Depart this mortal coil.

463
01:00:38,062 --> 01:00:39,461
Demon, be gone!

464
01:00:39,531 --> 01:00:41,260
Be gone?

465
01:00:41,332 --> 01:00:43,493
- Come on.
- Our Father, who art in heaven...

466
01:00:43,568 --> 01:00:45,536
There's no God, Buddy.

467
01:00:46,938 --> 01:00:48,769
And there's no heaven.

468
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,803
Give us this day our daily bread...

469
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:54,675
And do you know
what pissed me off the most?

470
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,071
No fucking wings.

471
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,163
Have you seen Vicki today?

472
01:01:17,235 --> 01:01:19,499
No, I went to pick her up this morning,
but I guess she just decided

473
01:01:19,571 --> 01:01:21,562
- to go on without me.
- Craig, there is something weird with her.

474
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:23,402
You've got to see the way she's dressed.

475
01:01:28,613 --> 01:01:30,774
<i>Hello Mary Lou</i>

476
01:01:31,816 --> 01:01:33,545
<i>Goodbye heart</i>

477
01:01:33,618 --> 01:01:37,349
<i>Sweet Mary Lou</i>
<i>I'm so in love with you</i>

478
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:40,991
<i>I knew Mary Lou</i>

479
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:45,493
<i>We'd never part</i>
<i>So hello Mary Lou</i>

480
01:01:45,563 --> 01:01:46,825
<i>Goodbye heart</i>

481
01:01:55,273 --> 01:01:58,902
Wow, fashion crime. What did you do?
Beat up the bag lady?

482
01:01:59,477 --> 01:02:03,243
They're my clothes.
If you don't like it, lump it.

483
01:02:03,314 --> 01:02:05,748
Hey, and where were you this morning?

484
01:02:06,517 --> 01:02:08,417
See you later, alligator.

485
01:02:10,021 --> 01:02:12,512
Hey, guys, wait up.

486
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,922
Craig's with me. Scram.

487
01:02:26,437 --> 01:02:28,166
Get the other side.

488
01:02:30,274 --> 01:02:32,367
Pull it together, bonehead!

489
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:38,712
Craig, what is wrong with her?

490
01:02:38,783 --> 01:02:41,377
I don't know. She says it's her new look.

491
01:02:41,452 --> 01:02:43,477
She looks like she's in a fashion coma.

492
01:02:43,554 --> 01:02:45,749
And she talks like
we're in an Elvis Presley movie.

493
01:02:45,823 --> 01:02:49,520
Hey, give her a break, guys, huh? I mean,
she's only trying to be an individual.

494
01:02:49,594 --> 01:02:52,757
I'm telling you guys, she's possessed.

495
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:55,890
Linda Blairsville.

496
01:02:55,967 --> 01:02:58,026
All right, get the center.

497
01:02:59,604 --> 01:03:03,040
Yeah. Okay.

498
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:08,607
We take care of the chemicals
and the chemicals will take care of us.

499
01:03:13,317 --> 01:03:15,512
And how are you doing, Vicki?

500
01:03:15,753 --> 01:03:17,618
Everything looks good from here.

501
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:20,021
This isn't working, Mr. Craven.

502
01:03:20,425 --> 01:03:25,158
Well, you need a little more

503
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:27,823
heat.

504
01:03:29,033 --> 01:03:31,524
The heat will make
the molecules move faster...

505
01:03:31,602 --> 01:03:35,265
- Vicki.
...thereby brewing the catalyst,

506
01:03:35,339 --> 01:03:37,807
our two chemicals.

507
01:03:38,843 --> 01:03:41,710
And making the experiment complete...

508
01:04:06,971 --> 01:04:08,336
<i>She makes a young man</i>
<i>groan and an old man pain</i>

509
01:04:08,406 --> 01:04:11,534
<i>The way she took my money</i>
<i>was a crying shame</i>

510
01:04:13,444 --> 01:04:17,881
I watched you in science class today.
You did something to Craven, didn't you?

511
01:04:17,949 --> 01:04:19,439
Of course not.

512
01:04:20,952 --> 01:04:22,681
It was an accident.

513
01:04:25,456 --> 01:04:27,549
Look, Vicki, you need help.

514
01:04:28,092 --> 01:04:30,925
I'm gonna go find Craig and tell him
and maybe he can get it through to you.

515
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:34,192
God, Vicki, can't you see
what's happening to you?

516
01:04:34,298 --> 01:04:36,027
Everything's swell.

517
01:04:40,471 --> 01:04:42,496
Nobody says swell anymore.

518
01:05:10,568 --> 01:05:13,401
- I'm sorry, Vicki.
- That's okay.

519
01:05:20,978 --> 01:05:23,879
Vicki, what are you doing? Vicki!

520
01:05:50,308 --> 01:05:52,538
Just stay away from me, Vicki!

521
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:10,621
Will somebody help me, please?

522
01:07:59,804 --> 01:08:03,638
<i>Tutti Frutti</i>
<i>All over rootie</i>

523
01:08:28,132 --> 01:08:30,123
It's gonna be a hot prom.

524
01:08:33,571 --> 01:08:34,799
Last one.

525
01:08:36,107 --> 01:08:39,270
I don't know if I'm ready
for the real world yet.

526
01:08:39,744 --> 01:08:41,644
How about some fantasy?

527
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:21,083
What's the matter, Nordham?
Don't you know how to use this thing?

528
01:09:21,285 --> 01:09:23,219
You turning into a fag, drag?

529
01:09:23,287 --> 01:09:24,720
What's wrong with you?

530
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:26,780
Don't you want to fuck me?

531
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,020
Vicki?

532
01:09:31,262 --> 01:09:32,422
Wrong.

533
01:09:45,443 --> 01:09:46,501
Dad!

534
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:49,339
Craig!

535
01:09:52,483 --> 01:09:53,472
No!

536
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:05,022
Looking for something, Billy?

537
01:10:17,575 --> 01:10:18,906
Good body.

538
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:22,443
Not as good as mine was, though.

539
01:10:22,546 --> 01:10:23,808
Remember?

540
01:10:23,948 --> 01:10:25,074
Vicki?

541
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:28,350
You knew I was coming, didn't you?

542
01:10:29,453 --> 01:10:31,114
Didn't you, Billy?

543
01:10:36,093 --> 01:10:37,958
I remember prom night.

544
01:10:40,498 --> 01:10:42,523
I was ready for the world.

545
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:48,063
I could've been anything.

546
01:10:54,979 --> 01:10:58,244
Only you wouldn't let me
wear my crown, Billy.

547
01:11:06,423 --> 01:11:07,685
Mary Lou?

548
01:11:07,925 --> 01:11:09,449
That's my name.

549
01:11:10,561 --> 01:11:12,222
Don't wear it out.

550
01:11:15,566 --> 01:11:17,193
Craig is so cool.

551
01:11:18,068 --> 01:11:19,968
What did he want to be?

552
01:11:27,011 --> 01:11:28,501
See you later,

553
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,514
alligator.

554
01:11:31,715 --> 01:11:32,739
No.

555
01:11:34,618 --> 01:11:35,915
No!

556
01:12:00,044 --> 01:12:01,773
You look beautiful.

557
01:12:02,246 --> 01:12:06,512
Your mother and I thought we were
the best-looking couple at our prom.

558
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:08,545
I had my first job.

559
01:12:08,886 --> 01:12:10,854
I was repossessing cars.

560
01:12:11,455 --> 01:12:16,552
Spent my first paycheck buying
your mother a corsage and a ring.

561
01:12:17,228 --> 01:12:19,856
And I had to wear my father's tux.

562
01:12:21,298 --> 01:12:24,893
You'll remember tonight forever.

563
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,562
I hope so.

564
01:12:28,405 --> 01:12:29,929
Hold me, Daddy.

565
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:41,679
What are you doing?

566
01:12:42,753 --> 01:12:44,482
What have you done?

567
01:12:48,525 --> 01:12:51,619
Jezebel! Harlot!

568
01:12:59,103 --> 01:13:01,628
You must repent your sins.

569
01:13:02,006 --> 01:13:03,633
Pay your penance.

570
01:13:05,709 --> 01:13:08,177
Father Cooper's busy right now.

571
01:13:08,445 --> 01:13:10,675
You're not leaving this house.

572
01:13:47,818 --> 01:13:49,149
Whoa, son.

573
01:13:49,887 --> 01:13:51,855
I gotta find Vicki, Dad.

574
01:13:52,089 --> 01:13:53,420
What happened?

575
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:56,516
I don't know. She went crazy
and attacked me. I gotta find her.

576
01:13:56,593 --> 01:14:01,030
No, son, you just lie back.
I'll take care of it. I started this.

577
01:14:01,765 --> 01:14:03,062
What are you talking about, Dad?

578
01:14:03,133 --> 01:14:05,727
You know something about this,
don't you?

579
01:14:05,836 --> 01:14:08,862
- Please, now, you just...
- No, you gotta stop controlling my life!

580
01:14:08,939 --> 01:14:10,531
I gotta find her.

581
01:14:14,244 --> 01:14:16,769
All right then, you just be careful.

582
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:19,311
All right. Where are my shoes?

583
01:14:23,087 --> 01:14:24,452
Right here.

584
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:27,914
I'm sorry, son.

585
01:14:56,153 --> 01:14:57,518
She's dead.

586
01:14:58,622 --> 01:15:03,457
I saw her burn. I went to the funeral.

587
01:15:27,718 --> 01:15:29,447
You stupid bastard.

588
01:15:36,827 --> 01:15:38,021
Oh, Buddy.

589
01:16:15,132 --> 01:16:16,292
Vicki!

590
01:16:19,503 --> 01:16:20,868
Hey, Vicki!

591
01:16:26,276 --> 01:16:27,800
You look great.

592
01:16:32,816 --> 01:16:34,215
Seen Monica?

593
01:16:54,538 --> 01:16:56,403
<i>Hi. Mary Lou speaking.</i>

594
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,700
<i>Sorry I can't come to the phone</i>
<i>right now but I'm busy at the prom.</i>

595
01:16:59,776 --> 01:17:03,337
<i>Places to go, people to kill.</i>
<i>Don't bother leaving a message.</i>

596
01:17:03,413 --> 01:17:05,438
<i>Vicki doesn't live here anymore.</i>

597
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:12,149
You have a drinking problem.

598
01:17:12,222 --> 01:17:14,622
I drink. I get drunk.

599
01:17:15,726 --> 01:17:17,626
So, what's the problem?

600
01:17:18,695 --> 01:17:22,597
I spent $64 on my hair today.
If you mess it up, I'll kill you!

601
01:18:10,581 --> 01:18:11,946
Young love.

602
01:18:13,016 --> 01:18:14,506
Then you croak.

603
01:18:24,361 --> 01:18:25,953
The winner is...

604
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,163
Who won?

605
01:18:34,438 --> 01:18:36,429
I'm not supposed to tell.

606
01:18:37,274 --> 01:18:38,764
It wasn't you.

607
01:18:44,047 --> 01:18:45,708
You knew my price.

608
01:19:03,934 --> 01:19:05,595
This is so sudden.

609
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:16,274
Put your hands on the keyboard
and start entering.

610
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:56,677
- Where have you been?
- Come on, I want to dance.

611
01:19:58,889 --> 01:20:03,019
Hey, got any more of those mints?
Your breath smells great.

612
01:20:10,033 --> 01:20:11,500
Sorry, Vicki.

613
01:20:23,547 --> 01:20:25,139
And the new winner is...

614
01:21:08,825 --> 01:21:10,349
<i>Quiet please.</i>

615
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:13,686
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

616
01:21:13,764 --> 01:21:17,598
<i>we're gonna pick the prom queen now.</i>

617
01:21:18,769 --> 01:21:21,829
<i>Absolute silence, please.</i>

618
01:21:23,974 --> 01:21:27,603
<i>Mavis, push the magic button, please.</i>

619
01:21:28,745 --> 01:21:30,940
<i>And the winner is...</i>

620
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:43,521
<i>Vicki Carpenter!</i>

621
01:22:48,525 --> 01:22:50,857
Hey, Kelly. How did you blow it?

622
01:23:22,392 --> 01:23:23,381
No!

623
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:51,680
Vicki.

624
01:23:52,689 --> 01:23:53,849
Craig.

625
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,493
Somebody call an ambulance.

626
01:24:05,568 --> 01:24:07,763
Call a fucking ambulance!

627
01:24:07,837 --> 01:24:10,635
It's Mr. Nordham. He's got a gun!

628
01:24:13,877 --> 01:24:14,935
Dad.

629
01:24:32,429 --> 01:24:33,726
No!

630
01:26:16,566 --> 01:26:19,228
You're really starting to piss me off.

631
01:27:36,179 --> 01:27:37,840
- Hello, Craig.
- No!

632
01:28:14,751 --> 01:28:17,447
You're in deep shit.

633
01:28:23,026 --> 01:28:26,120
Craig, are you there?

634
01:28:27,063 --> 01:28:29,725
It's me, Vicki. Let me in!

635
01:28:29,799 --> 01:28:31,061
She's at the door.

636
01:28:31,134 --> 01:28:33,227
Please, please, let me in.

637
01:28:35,972 --> 01:28:37,132
Craig.

638
01:28:41,911 --> 01:28:43,776
Oh, God.

639
01:28:52,488 --> 01:28:55,480
I was so scared.
I couldn't find you anywhere.

640
01:28:56,326 --> 01:28:59,193
Craig, what happened to me? It hurts.

641
01:29:00,029 --> 01:29:03,192
Oh, God. Vicki. Vicki.

642
01:29:10,206 --> 01:29:12,265
- Sucker.
- No!

643
01:29:14,844 --> 01:29:16,334
Bye-bye.

644
01:29:33,663 --> 01:29:36,928
See you later, alligator.

645
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,467
No! No! No! No!

646
01:29:50,847 --> 01:29:52,644
No!

647
01:29:52,715 --> 01:29:54,148
Mary Lou.

648
01:30:52,308 --> 01:30:58,975
<i>Little girl, all the world</i>
<i>will be yours tonight</i>

649
01:30:59,048 --> 01:31:04,850
<i>My queen of the senior prom</i>

650
01:31:07,857 --> 01:31:12,226
<i>And some day you'll recall</i>

651
01:31:12,595 --> 01:31:15,962
<i>Being belle of the ball</i>

652
01:31:16,766 --> 01:31:23,399
<i>In your beautiful gown of white</i>

653
01:31:33,916 --> 01:31:35,042
Craig!

654
01:31:40,723 --> 01:31:42,088
It's Vicki.

655
01:31:43,493 --> 01:31:44,653
Craig!

656
01:32:09,485 --> 01:32:11,783
You take sugar in your coffee?

657
01:32:14,357 --> 01:32:16,552
No, that stuff will kill you.

658
01:32:17,693 --> 01:32:19,024
Oh, Vicki.

659
01:32:23,366 --> 01:32:26,802
I don't know what we got here.
Something strange.

660
01:32:55,331 --> 01:32:56,593
You okay?

661
01:32:57,934 --> 01:32:58,992
Dad?

662
01:33:10,746 --> 01:33:12,304
It's fucking cold.

663
01:33:13,015 --> 01:33:15,609
- You okay?
- Yeah.

664
01:33:17,487 --> 01:33:21,719
<i>I'm going to tell you</i>
<i>a story about a Mary Lou</i>

665
01:33:22,892 --> 01:33:24,154
Hey, kids.

666
01:33:26,796 --> 01:33:28,787
They're playing our song.

667
01:33:34,937 --> 01:33:36,336
Let's cruise.
