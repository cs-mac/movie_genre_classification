MADDIE: Okay, you guys.

1136
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,112
This is gonna sound crazy,

1137
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:07,918
but eons ago,
these demons defied divine law

1138
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:10,288
and tried to take the place
of the devil.

1139
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:12,017
As a punishment,

1140
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:14,756
they were bound together
and cast out of hell.

1141
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:18,828
But there's always a loophole.

1142
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,665
If demons could possess
seven people

1143
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,205
over the course
of one Halloween night,

1144
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,832
they'd be free.

1145
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,434
And that's where
Evangeline came in.

1146
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,918
When she was practicing spells,

1147
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:38,111
these were the demons
she contacted.

1148
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,485
They tricked her into inviting
people over for a séance.

1149
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:45,752
The demons just needed
seven bodies,

1150
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,522
and as soon as the ritual started,

1151
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,859
they started possessing people.

1152
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,128
Once one person had turned,

1153
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,327
all they had to do
was kiss or bite someone

1154
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,998
to possess all the rest as well.

1155
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,972
Soon, six people turned into demons.

1156
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,977
And they only needed one more.

1157
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,343
But they can't use a dead body,

1158
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,282
only a living one.

1159
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:12,684
So when Evangeline realized
she wouldn't make it till dawn...

1160
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,022
...she killed herself

1161
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:26,033
to keep the demons from getting out.

1162
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,628
So....

1163
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,207
There it is.

1164
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:36,301
Um... I don't understand something.

1165
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:39,575
What kind of demon
gets cast out of hell?

1166
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:41,013
These ones.

1167
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,209
They were bad-ass.

1168
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:46,048
They couldn't even follow
hell's rules.

1169
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:49,955
So... we're the only thing
standing between them

1170
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,220
and the end of the world.

1171
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,193
-That's awesome.
-Yep.

1172
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:55,728
And Jason was right.

1173
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,059
They really don't like
the rusted iron.

1174
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,428
Yes.

1175

1176
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:04,635
Well, come on.
I mean, that's completely random.

1177
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,264
No, not really.

1178
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,536
Demons are made
from ancient elements.

1179
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:11,772
Iron's an ancient element.
Rust corrupts it.

1180
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:16,715
So, you put the two together,
and demons don't like it.

1181

That makes sense.

to believe this or not,

I mean, these bastards
want to kill us, right?
