2
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,397
Blackie!
Blackie!

3
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,869
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna tie him up.

4
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:33,879
Calm down.
Calm down!

5
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,718
Neve?
Is... is that you?

6
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,291
It's Neve!
Call here parents.

7
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,337
Shh.
Calm down, Neve.

8
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,840
It's gonna be all right.

9
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:48,421
What happened?

10
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,744
What was she doing in the forest?

11
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:50,879
Henry and Maud are coming.

12
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:51,948
They're close.

13
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,351
They think she's afraid
of the house,

14
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,389
that she jumped out
of the window to escape.

15
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,391
Neve, do you hear?

16
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,359
Your parents are coming.

17
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:58,562
Oh, God, Lucas,
look at her mouth!

18
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,499
Jesus Christ!

19
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:02,736
Shh, Neve, Neve...
Neve...

20
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:11,253
Shit.

21
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:13,257
Her tongue has been cut.

22
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,627
Looks like a bite.

23
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:16,096
Who did this to you?

24
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:17,232
Was it the dog?

25
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,501
Neve...
Neve, what happened?

26
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,339
Ryan and Lucy,
go back upstairs, now!

27
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:22,275
She's covered
in scratches and bruises.

28
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:23,378
She must have fallen,

29
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,081
either with the dog or earlier.

30
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,659
Oh my God.
What's all this blood?

31
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,435
- Oh, God...
- Who did this to you?

32
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,475
Did someone break in
to the house?

33
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:43,551
Why did you jump?
You could have killed yourself.

34
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,095
Okay, let's go, now.

35
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:51,367
Come on, come on.

36
00:05:55,477 --> 00:05:57,479
It wasn't me-e-e!

37
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:04,727
It wasn't me, Daddy!

38
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:08,968
Okay, let's go upstairs.
Mommy's upset, let's go.

39
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,509
Shh. Shh, shh...

40
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,026
Who is that?

41
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:31,501
Do you know them?

42
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:53,043
Hi.
Come in.

43
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:55,214
Maud, Neve, come downstairs.

44
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:56,317
Look who's here!

45
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,488
Sit down.

46
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,890
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes, please.

47
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:01,494
Please.

48
00:08:01,496 --> 00:08:03,130
How are you?

49
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,267
Not too shaken up?

50
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,439
She looked so terrified.

51
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:08,908
That wound...

52
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:12,148
I don't know what to think.

53
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,751
I'm gonna ask advice
from a friend in Galway,

54
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:15,555
who's a shrink.

55
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:17,893
Hiya, Neve.

56
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,563
How you feeling?

57
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,032
We came to see how you are.

58
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,536
Say hello, Neve.

59
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:25,240
You've got to
exercise your tongue.

60
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:27,211
Hello.

61
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,220
Are you all right?

62
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:52,963
Two years is not long enough.

63
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,869
I'm sorry we couldn't be there.

64
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,273
I know Mary loved Henry.

65
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:00,578
He was her favorite doctor.

66
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,078
I just hope she soon
settles into the house.

67
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,750
A shelf fell down yesterday.

68
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:23,156
It was my fault, I didn't
put it up properly, but...

69
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:25,294
She thinks things move.

70
00:09:26,364 --> 00:09:29,102
The house creaks, it's normal.

71
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:32,809
She's forgotten what it's like
living in the country.

72
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:36,317
But, if she doesn't settle,
then we'll have to move.

73
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:39,255
Even if it means
going back into town.

74
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:42,696
After only one month now,
it's a bit of shame,

75
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:43,965
but, still...

76
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:48,240
And we're gonna have to
do her bedroom up again.

77
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:50,177
Let her choose everything
this time.

78
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,150
Maybe she'll feel better then.

79
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,455
And I've cut the branches down
outside her window.

80
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:56,991
They were casting shadows
over the wall.

81
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:59,095
We had to do that, too,
for our kids.

82
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:00,799
They were scared stiff by them.

83
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,302
And leave a night light
on for her.

84
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:04,339
Oh, we bought one of those
this morning.

85
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:06,042
Do you not miss living in town?

86
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:08,347
With your high class patients?

87
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:10,250
No, I'm fed up with all that.

88
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:12,254
Besides, the country's better
for the kids.

89
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:15,695
That's enough, Neve.

90
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,298
Leave him alone.

91
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:20,204
How many times
have we told you, dammit!

92
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:23,644
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:26,817
Neve is still
very jealous of her brother.

94
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,440
She doesn't mean to hurt him,

95
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:31,627
but children don't always realize
how violent they can be.

96
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:35,100
You're still a little tired,
sweetheart.

97
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,307
Go upstairs and have a rest,
and I'll come up and see you.

98
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:06,095
Nat?

99
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:07,565
You okay?

100
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,270
Yeah, I just...
I have this ringing in my ears.

101
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:11,707
Hmm?

102
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:15,113
It's... it's okay.
It's gone now.

103
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:18,387
Come on, let's hurry up.
The kids are waiting on us.

104
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,195
Shh.

105
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,199
Don't be afraid.

106
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,109
Everything's all right.

107
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:54,980
Trust us.

108
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,698
Can you give Mummy a smile?

109
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:14,071
A good night kiss?

110
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,170
Mummy...
Daddy...

111
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:44,539
What's that noise?

112
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,443
Who was that screaming?

113
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:55,461
Neve!
What are you doing?

114
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:57,130
Bring your brother back here,
now!

115
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,740
Neve!

116
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:37,110
Neve, protect your brother!

117
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,014
Go downstairs!

118
00:17:56,016 --> 00:17:59,154
Downstairs!
Go!

119
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:40,904
Aargh!

120
00:18:40,906 --> 00:18:42,675
Brooke!

121
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:57,424
...no sign of them.

122
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:01,098
...to control...

123
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,200
We have recovered two adults,

124
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,837
we're still missing
two children.

125
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,972
Over.

126
00:20:04,974 --> 00:20:07,378
<i>Check around the back.</i>

127
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,365
There's something here.

128
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,648
Come here.

129
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,284
- Come here.
- No!

130
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,119
Aaah!

131
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,389
Ciaran...

132
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:47,891
Ciaran!

133
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:51,365
No!

134
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,935
Ciaran!

135
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:57,778
Ciaran!

136
00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:01,051
Let go of me!
What's wrong with him?

137
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,723
It's okay, it's okay.

138
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:04,692
My little brother!

139
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:06,294
Neve... Neve, it's me.
It's Joseph.

140
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:07,698
Neve!

141
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,602
Ciaran!

142
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:17,818
His ribs were compressed
too tight for too long.

143
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:21,024
He suffocated to death.

144
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,126
That wasn't the smoke.

145
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:24,063
The cupboard protected them.

146
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,602
She was squeezing him so hard,
could she... have...?

147
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:27,838
Maybe, but...

148
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,975
I don't think she would have
had the strength.

149
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:38,426
She's saying that
the house went crazy.

150
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:38,945
Poor girl.

151
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:41,532
I mean, even if she doesn't
remember the attackers,

152
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,467
we're gonna try
and keep her here

153
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,070
during the investigation.

154
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:45,607
I'm not sure where, exactly.

155
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:48,947
And it's going to take time
to find her a foster home.

156
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:50,750
We can take her.

157
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:55,159
Yes, of course.
Of course.

158
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:56,896
It might take a while.

159
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,098
It would be better for her

160
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,135
to start back at school
at start of term,

161
00:22:00,137 --> 00:22:01,171
so she doesn't fall behind.

162
00:22:01,173 --> 00:22:03,509
We can keep her
for as long as she needs.

163
00:22:03,511 --> 00:22:05,012
We have a spare room.

164
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:06,315
Well, okay then.

165
00:22:06,317 --> 00:22:07,951
Just the time being.

166
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:09,722
It'll help me out.

167
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:11,392
It's very kind of you.

168
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:14,898
If there's anything you notice,
you let us know.

169
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,167
I better go.

170
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,742
I didn't have
her medical records.

171
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:21,912
I suppose her father
looked after her.

172
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:23,983
All those marks and scars...

173
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:25,119
She had a bad accident

174
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:27,089
when she lived here
when she was little.

175
00:22:27,091 --> 00:22:29,928
She was a bit of a daredevil.
She must not have changed.

176
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,634
Last week, she cut her tongue
escaping her house.

177
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:34,270
Last night, was she...

178
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:37,043
Was she hit or abused
in any way?

179
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:40,617
I'm not allowed to tell you.

180
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,925
She's had a shock, so...

181
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:48,599
Don't be surprised if she's
withdrawn or difficult.

182
00:22:57,852 --> 00:22:59,955
Don't cry.

183
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:01,157
Not in front of her.

184
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:07,871
Oh...

185
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:09,641
Nat?

186
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:17,958
Okay.

187
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
It's okay.

188
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:21,999
I'll be all right.
It's okay.

189
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:50,757
Neve?

190
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:54,598
Neve?

191
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,902
No... No!

192
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:11,499
Be careful!

193
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:20,817
I'm Tanya.

194
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:23,489
I'm the welfare officer
from school.

195
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:25,426
I'm here to help you.

196
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:53,950
She's only here
for the time it takes

197
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:57,490
to find the best possible
solution for her.

198
00:24:57,492 --> 00:25:00,262
Don't go overboard,
or get too attached.

199
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,869
I'm just saying it
for your sake.

200
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:45,953
You okay?

201
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:53,803
Do you like your new room?

202
00:25:55,874 --> 00:25:57,911
Another girl...

203
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:01,952
Another girl
used to live here, but...

204
00:26:01,954 --> 00:26:03,656
she left.

205
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:10,001
Well, we... we can talk
about that another time.

206
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:14,511
Did you try any of
your new clothes on?

207
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,053
Do you wanna go
and buy some more?

208
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:24,765
Do you want to have
a quick wash?

209
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,167
No.

210
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:29,073
Okay, well...

211
00:26:29,075 --> 00:26:30,309
that doesn't matter.

212
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:32,079
Dinner will be ready
in about an hour,

213
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:35,319
if you want to go outside
for a breath of fresh air.

214
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:29,748
What are you doing?

215
00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:33,389
Nothing.

216
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:35,459
Just looking out the window.

217
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:38,231
Do you want a glass of water?

218
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:39,768
Can't you sleep?

219
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:43,007
I don't know.

220
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:51,658
Tell me if you're too hot,
or you're too cold,

221
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,798
or you need, ah,
thinner blankets.

222
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,133
If you're frightened,

223
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,372
you can come in
and sleep with us.

224
00:28:58,374 --> 00:28:59,941
Or I can come in
and sleep here with you,

225
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:01,611
if you prefer.

226
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:06,187
Okay.

227
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:08,157
Good night, then.

228
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,854
It was a long war.

229
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:26,060
They didn't fight
like we do nowadays.

230
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:29,767
Look at those weapons.

231
00:29:32,407 --> 00:29:34,811
What do you call that long
blade with the handle?

232
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:35,846
See the soldier standing up

233
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:37,783
in the center of the picture?

234
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:41,391
Don't worry, Neve.

235
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:43,862
You've only missed
the first few days.

236
00:29:43,864 --> 00:29:45,866
You'll soon catch up.

237
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:54,082
Shush.

238
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:58,392
I haven't heard the bell yet.

239
00:29:58,394 --> 00:30:00,796
It's a sword.

240
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:02,199
A sword.

241
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,437
Okay?

242
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:06,207
Turn to the next page...

243
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:39,440
Morons, you stink!

244
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:41,645
- Morons.
- Eww!

245
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:50,529
I thought it might be nice

246
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:53,100
if we ate lunch together
from time to time.

247
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,470
Just the two of us.

248
00:30:54,472 --> 00:30:56,073
What do you think?

249
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,187
And what about
the other children?

250
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:04,624
Are they nice?

251
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:07,162
I don't know.

252
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,642
And is everything going okay
with Nat and Lucas?

253
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:16,348
And Ryan and Lucy,
do you get on?

254
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:24,964
Oh, you're still very sad.
That's normal.

255
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:29,440
Do you want to talk
about your parents

256
00:31:29,442 --> 00:31:31,110
and your brother?

257
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:34,015
Not necessarily about
what happened.

258
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:36,053
We can talk about before.

259
00:31:36,055 --> 00:31:37,957
Your own memories.

260
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,470
Did I tell you about the day

261
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:46,708
I ate all the caviar

262
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,212
my parents had put aside
for an important dinner?

263
00:31:51,185 --> 00:31:53,220
Do you know what caviar is?

264
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:33,675
Ow!

265
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,258
Neve.

266
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,530
Are you okay, sweetheart?

267
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:47,603
Is something the matter?
Tell me.

268
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,282
They're silly, aren't they?

269
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:55,452
When I'm finished
with these two,

270
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:56,954
I'll give you a bath, okay?
But not with them,

271
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:59,092
because you're a big girl now.

272
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:00,629
Is... is Lucas home yet?

273
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,870
That's enough, you two.
Come on, now.

274
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,045
You know, Neve,
you really must have a wash.

275
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,549
I've left towels and soap
in your room,

276
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:12,486
but you haven't touched them.

277
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:13,621
It's been too long now, really.

278
00:35:13,623 --> 00:35:15,124
It can't go on like this.

279
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:17,295
It can't.
I... I'll help you.

280
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:24,910
Okay.

281
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:27,014
Head back so it doesn't
sting your eyes.

282
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:33,862
You're it!

283
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:35,231
- You be it.
- Come on, kids.

284
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,903
Come on, stop fooling around,
you need to get dressed now.

285
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:41,076
Lucy, you... Ryan!

286
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:43,180
He didn't touch me!

287
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:48,858
Neve?

288
00:35:51,765 --> 00:35:53,066
Neve?

289
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,476
What is going on?

290
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:58,023
This is...

291
00:35:58,024 --> 00:35:59,880
I can't have this.
I'm sorry, Neve.

292
00:35:59,882 --> 00:36:01,182
This is ridiculous.

293
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:02,352
Come on, get up.
Stand up.

294
00:36:02,354 --> 00:36:03,488
- Neve...
- No!

295
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,759
Come on.
Neve, the water is not clean.

296
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:07,529
It's already been used,
and it's cold.

297
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,835
You'll feel better afterwards,
you'll see.

298
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:12,572
Now, now... turn around.

299
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:14,610
Let me help you.

300
00:36:14,612 --> 00:36:15,946
Don't be scared.

301
00:36:15,948 --> 00:36:18,150
That's the way to do it.

302
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:20,755
You remember, don't you.

303
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:30,442
Oh!

304
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:42,031
Hurt myself with that damn...

305
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,002
Sorry.

306
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:51,784
No... No!

307
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:53,153
It's okay, it's just a draft.

308
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:55,124
Just some clothes on the floor.

309
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:57,829
Everything's fine, okay?
There's nothing to be scared of.

310
00:36:57,831 --> 00:36:59,232
Trust me.

311
00:37:06,715 --> 00:37:08,050
They've nothing.

312
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:10,655
Nothing whatsoever,
not even a lead.

313
00:37:13,996 --> 00:37:15,765
I know you spoke
to Joseph today, Neve,

314
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,869
down at the police station.

315
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:22,278
He came to school.

316
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:24,950
He wants to punish
those bad people

317
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:27,689
who did all that nasty stuff
at your house.

318
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:30,260
So that's why he's persevering.

319
00:37:30,262 --> 00:37:31,797
You do understand?

320
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,939
And also, so it doesn't
happen again.

321
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:39,546
I've already said it.

322
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,650
It's the house.

323
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,472
We can call
your father's sister later.

324
00:37:52,474 --> 00:37:55,077
The one who lives
in the States.

325
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,883
Wouldn't you like
to see her, or speak to her?

326
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:04,630
It's my belt.

327
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:05,932
One of the trouser loops
is broken,

328
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:07,469
and the belt keeps rising up.

329
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:07,971
It itches.

330
00:38:11,745 --> 00:38:13,915
Someone at school
thought you were my sister,

331
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:14,917
that you'd come back.

332
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,186
Ryan!

333
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:18,123
My dead sister Mary.

334
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,160
You were friends
when you were little.

335
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:21,730
Your daddy was her doctor.

336
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:22,699
She had cancer.

337
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:27,943
Fee, fie, foe, fum!

338
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:30,448
Finished, finished,
finished, finished!

339
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,051
Lucy, please.

340
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:33,888
Hey, give that back!

341
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,224
- Give it back!
- Hey!

342
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:36,727
That's enough.

343
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:38,063
If you're not back at the table

344
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:41,370
by the time I've counted to ten,
you're going straight to bed.

345
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,443
One...

346
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,480
Two...

347
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:47,949
Nat, we're all out of beer.

348
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:50,120
Three...

349
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,256
Four...

350
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:52,926
I'll get some.

351
00:38:54,062 --> 00:38:55,732
Ryan and Lucy,
come help me pick a bottle.

352
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:58,638
- Yaay! The cellar!
- The cellar!

353
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,107
- I'm not scared.
- You're a scaredy cat.

354
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:01,209
- No, you are.
- No, I'm not. You are.

355
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,179
Ryan, no running.

356
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:12,866
We used to have
another little girl, but, em...

357
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:15,571
she died.

358
00:39:18,545 --> 00:39:19,546
We didn't say anything,

359
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:21,850
because it happened
a long time ago.

360
00:39:21,852 --> 00:39:23,219
That's all.

361
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:27,529
And we didn't want it
to upset you.

362
00:39:44,297 --> 00:39:45,542
Something touched me!

363
00:39:45,543 --> 00:39:48,269
Ryan, just... I'm gonna
switch the light back on.

364
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,529
Did you knock it over?

365
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:19,666
That doesn't matter, don't cry.

366
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:23,374
Neve?

367
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:26,647
Oh!

368
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:36,032
Nat?

369
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,368
Nat?!

370
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:42,479
Stay where you are!
You have to...

371
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:46,252
Nat!

372
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:51,229
You okay?!
Are you hurt?

373
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:52,899
Daddy... Daddy!

374
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:54,369
What happened here?

375
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:57,942
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

376
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:04,154
Daddy...

377
00:41:04,156 --> 00:41:05,324
Are you hurt, Ryan?

378
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:06,527
No.

379
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:18,751
Shh, shh.

380
00:41:24,129 --> 00:41:25,698
Neve?

381
00:41:27,436 --> 00:41:28,771
Oh, Neve...

382
00:41:28,773 --> 00:41:29,940
What...?

383
00:41:29,942 --> 00:41:31,543
Neve!

384
00:41:31,545 --> 00:41:33,314
Leave her alone, okay?
I'll put these two to bed,

385
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,851
and then I'll-
I'll be right back, okay?

386
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:40,328
Sorry.

387
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:43,934
Let's throw everything away
that could harm anyone,

388
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,905
and we'll sort out the rest
tomorrow, okay?

389
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:48,276
Nat, this is impossible.

390
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:50,648
Have you seen what she's done?

391
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,752
It's not the same
for Ryan and Lucy.

392
00:41:52,754 --> 00:41:54,154
They were bumping
into everything.

393
00:41:54,156 --> 00:41:55,156
And scared.

394
00:41:55,158 --> 00:41:56,793
They hurt themselves.

395
00:41:56,795 --> 00:41:58,029
But her...

396
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,072
- Why did she...
- I don't know, Lucas.

397
00:42:03,074 --> 00:42:05,143
Don't you think she got scared
by all the screaming

398
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:07,482
and the noises in the cellar?

399
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,419
Maybe it reminded her
of that night.

400
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:12,392
I went into her room just now,
and she was so scared,

401
00:42:12,394 --> 00:42:13,560
as if I was gonna...

402
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:15,130
You've got to speak with Tanya
straight away.

403
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,635
- This is not normal!
- Lucas...

404
00:42:17,637 --> 00:42:18,704
We can't give up on her

405
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:19,906
at the first problem
we encounter.

406
00:42:19,908 --> 00:42:22,010
She is traumatized.

407
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,620
We'll see tomorrow, okay?

408
00:42:26,622 --> 00:42:27,555
Okay.

409
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:32,532

416
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:14,969
No, please!

417
00:44:16,475 --> 00:44:17,408
Aah!

418
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:30,199
What the hell
are you doing there?

419
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:32,237
Go home!

420
00:44:35,946 --> 00:44:37,381
Didn't you hear me?

421
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:39,986
Get outta here.

422
00:44:39,988 --> 00:44:40,821
Get lost!

423
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,421
Are you coming outside with me?

424
00:44:57,423 --> 00:44:59,124
Help us, please.

425
00:44:59,126 --> 00:45:00,761
Help us.

426
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,473
Please.

427
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:09,044
Please...

428
00:45:48,892 --> 00:45:50,159
- Mommy!
- Shut up!

429
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:52,598
No.
No!

430
00:45:58,712 --> 00:46:00,848
What's going on?

431
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,384
Who's doing that?

432
00:46:21,457 --> 00:46:22,958
Make it stop.

433
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,227
Make it stop!

434
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,935
Make it stop!

435
00:46:29,474 --> 00:46:31,576
I'm not doing anything, Mummy!

436
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:39,992
What is it?

437
00:46:39,994 --> 00:46:41,362
What is it?!

438
00:46:41,364 --> 00:46:44,134
Peter... Peter!

439
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:46,038
Let her go, Mummy!

440
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,242
Please, I'm begging you!

441
00:47:55,978 --> 00:47:57,815
Neve!

442
00:47:59,853 --> 00:48:00,821
Neve.

443
00:48:00,823 --> 00:48:02,558
Neve, can you hear me?

444
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:30,012
Jenny will pick
the little ones up

445
00:48:30,014 --> 00:48:31,749
from school,
don't worry about that.

446
00:48:32,685 --> 00:48:34,755
Neve says she hasn't seen
Peter or Emily.

447
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:36,426
They've disappeared.

448
00:48:36,428 --> 00:48:37,928
Couldn't get anything
out of her.

449
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,732
It's just a coincidence.

450
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:41,335
I'm not sure.

451
00:48:41,337 --> 00:48:42,671
There are fingerprints
of several children

452
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:45,142
all over the house,
and Neve's are amongst them.

453
00:48:45,144 --> 00:48:46,111
It doesn't prove anything.

454
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:48,516
She could have left them
there anytime.

455
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:54,160
What?

456
00:48:55,263 --> 00:48:56,365
What do you think
Neve has done?

457
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,303
You think she murdered
an entire family?

458
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:00,005
Nobody's saying that, Nat.

459
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:01,041
But the circumstances

460
00:49:01,043 --> 00:49:02,210
surrounding both murder scenes

461
00:49:02,212 --> 00:49:03,746
are very similar.

462
00:49:03,748 --> 00:49:05,149
And she ran away
from your house

463
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,519
just when it was happening.

464
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:07,855
So?

465
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:10,226
She can't even remember
who killed her parents.

466
00:49:10,228 --> 00:49:12,898
I don't know,
that's what she says.

467
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,071
Children are very easily
influenced.

468
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:17,774
And these people, these...

469
00:49:17,776 --> 00:49:18,910
murderers...

470
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:20,514
Maybe she knows them.

471
00:49:20,516 --> 00:49:22,083
Or maybe she's listening
to what they tell her.

472
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:23,920
I just...
I... I don't know.

473
00:49:23,922 --> 00:49:25,524
What?

474
00:49:25,526 --> 00:49:26,492
Lucas...

475
00:49:26,494 --> 00:49:28,396
Say something!

476
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,836
Maybe it's best just to keep her
out of the way for a while.

477
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:34,675
Everyone knows everyone's
business around here.

478
00:49:36,012 --> 00:49:37,179
People are superstitious.

479
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:38,950
They're gonna start
imagining things.

480
00:49:38,952 --> 00:49:41,923
No, she must go
back to school as normal.

481
00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:44,828
You must tell people
to stop talking rubbish.

482
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,231
And I'll do the same.

483
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:50,039
She'll never get over this
if nobody helps her.

484
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:51,007
What about your daughter?

485
00:49:51,009 --> 00:49:53,680
She's the same age as Neve,
isn't she?

486
00:49:53,682 --> 00:49:55,317
And she has a birthday party
next week,

487
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:57,321
you should invite Neve.

488
00:49:57,323 --> 00:49:59,325
It would suit you to keep her
cooped up here,

489
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:02,397
but Henry helped your
little girl when she was tiny.

490
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,035
People protect themselves.

491
00:50:05,037 --> 00:50:06,339
They protect their kids.

492
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:07,507
That's all.

493
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:11,649
No one's going to leave you
in the lurch, Nat, okay?

494
00:50:13,387 --> 00:50:14,755
I'll come by tomorrow.

495
00:50:15,524 --> 00:50:17,995
But I'm asking you
to do one thing.

496
00:50:17,997 --> 00:50:19,698
Keep an eye on her.

497
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,638
She mustn't go out alone,
or sleep by herself.

498
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,910
We can't find her
wandering the streets.

499
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:52,196
How many different species

500
00:50:52,198 --> 00:50:54,233
can you name from memory?

501
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:05,490
according to
the estimated figures,

502
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:09,230
between five and a hundred
million different species

503
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,167
inhabit our planet.

504
00:51:28,236 --> 00:51:29,972
Are you all right?

505
00:51:31,443 --> 00:51:32,878
Yes.

506
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:01,067
Neve...

507
00:52:01,069 --> 00:52:02,269
Aren't you coming outside?

508
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:03,906
Yes.

509
00:52:21,377 --> 00:52:23,346
- Why is she here?
- It's her...

510
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,917
- ...the murderer.
- She killed 'em.

511
00:52:25,919 --> 00:52:29,791
Killed her family,
and Peter and Emily's mum.

512
00:52:40,146 --> 00:52:41,782
Hey!

513
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:43,285
What's going on here?

514
00:52:43,287 --> 00:52:44,688
Come on, break it up.
Break it up.

515
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,659
- What are you doing?
- Why are you being so mean?

516
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:48,329
- Lucy!
- Come on, come on.

517
00:52:50,936 --> 00:52:53,539
- Stop being so nasty.
- Neve, wait. Neve!

518
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:54,875
Back, back.
Come on, go play.

519
00:52:54,877 --> 00:52:55,743
Come here, come here.

520
00:52:55,745 --> 00:52:56,812
You're having
your birthday party,

521
00:52:56,814 --> 00:52:58,382
I want you to invite her
at the weekend, okay?

522
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,486
- No, Mummy, please no.
- Yes, darling, come on.

523
00:53:00,488 --> 00:53:01,322
- It's okay.

524
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:02,958
But I have to go
and check on Neve,

525
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,628
she's in there
on her own, okay?

526
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:07,099
She's got nobody, and you've got
me and you've got Daddy, okay?

527
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,134
- Okay.
- Okay?

528
00:53:08,136 --> 00:53:09,103
Okay.

529
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:10,907
Now, go on.
Be good.

530
00:53:19,726 --> 00:53:21,294
Neve.

531
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,872
Shall we go back
to the classroom?

532
00:53:29,077 --> 00:53:30,413
Well, then...

533
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,284
I'm having a birthday party
on Saturday.

534
00:53:33,286 --> 00:53:36,692
You can come.
My mum will explain.

535
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:36,778
Let's stay concentrated,
please.

536
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:09,243
Got to get out.

537
00:55:09,245 --> 00:55:11,180
Sit back down, Neve.

538
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,752
It'll soon be break time,
and I'll come down to you.

539
00:55:25,545 --> 00:55:28,181
Got to get out of here!

540
00:55:47,755 --> 00:55:49,424
Neve...

541
00:55:49,426 --> 00:55:52,162
Come on, come with me.

542
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,165
What's the matter?

543
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:13,405
Come on, we'll ask someone
to bring us two lunch trays,

544
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:15,141
and we can eat in the office.

545
00:56:15,143 --> 00:56:17,313
Just the two of us, okay?

546
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:21,755
Are you okay?

547
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:27,400
It's... it's me.

548
00:56:27,402 --> 00:56:30,639
I'm... I'm the one
who does all that.

549
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:34,179
I make objects move when I cry.

550
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,756
I made... I made them
kill my parents.

551
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,262
Peter and Emily's mother.

552
00:56:42,264 --> 00:56:44,467
Neve, what are you
going on about?

553
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:46,838
No one can do that.

554
00:56:48,343 --> 00:56:51,715
It's not your fault
if bad things happen.

555
00:56:53,386 --> 00:56:54,521
Come on.

556
00:56:54,523 --> 00:56:56,223
Let's go eat.

557
00:56:57,361 --> 00:56:59,531
And how is everything going
in Nat and Lucas's?

558
00:56:59,533 --> 00:57:01,267
Are they nice to you?

559
00:57:01,269 --> 00:57:03,505
They keep talking to me.

560
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:06,378
Hugging me, smiling at me.

561
00:57:08,584 --> 00:57:10,553
And don't you like smiles?

562
00:57:10,555 --> 00:57:12,657
A smile is kind, isn't it?

563
00:57:15,363 --> 00:57:18,234
Well, you're right, it depends.

564
00:57:19,538 --> 00:57:21,240
But you can usually tell
if someone's smile

565
00:57:21,242 --> 00:57:23,879
is kind or nasty, can't you?

566
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:26,985
I heard you'd been invited

567
00:57:26,987 --> 00:57:29,457
to Anne's birthday party
on Saturday.

568
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:30,726
That's great.

569
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:34,400
I bet you will have
lots of fun.

570
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:38,742
I used to have little parties
when I was young.

571
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,352
Well, I already told you
about the one with the big dog.

572
00:57:43,354 --> 00:57:44,521
But there were others.

573
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:01,287
You want to touch it?

574
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:33,037
Hey.

575
00:59:35,344 --> 00:59:38,247
You already know each other,
don't you?

576
00:59:39,283 --> 00:59:41,120
But maybe you don't know

577
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:44,627
that Matthew Collins
is my baby's daddy.

578
01:00:59,511 --> 01:01:03,183
Well, there are a lot
of unanswered questions here.

579
01:01:04,955 --> 01:01:09,229
She was assaulted that night
the first murders took place.

580
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:11,301
Maybe by that gang.

581
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:14,874
Ah, I don't know.

582
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:19,049
I'm wondering if it doesn't
go further back...

583
01:01:21,588 --> 01:01:24,760
if it's not her parents
that abused her that night...

584
01:01:24,762 --> 01:01:26,931
and even before.

585
01:01:30,373 --> 01:01:33,945
She's got all the symptoms
of an abused child.

586
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,953
And look at
Peter and Emily's mother...

587
01:01:39,056 --> 01:01:41,995
It's a strange coincidence.

588
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,873
Try to think about
something else for a while.

589
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,512
For our sakes, and the baby's.

590
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,653
I'll come and pick you up
after school.

591
01:01:54,655 --> 01:01:55,822
Okay?

592
01:01:56,959 --> 01:01:58,962
I better get gone.

593
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,801
See you later.

594
01:02:26,985 --> 01:02:28,955
How was school today?

595
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:31,059
They told us
about Peter and Emily,

596
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:32,496
and their mother.

597
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:34,900
They said we must
always stay together,

598
01:02:34,902 --> 01:02:37,238
and tell someone
if we see a stranger.

599
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,977
We mustn't go into the forest.

600
01:02:41,114 --> 01:02:44,152
Don't' worry, sweetheart,
it won't be for too long.

601
01:02:52,504 --> 01:02:54,105
Here.

602
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:56,042
You haven't had
too many sweeties today.

603
01:02:56,979 --> 01:02:58,046
Here.

604
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:00,083
Come on...

605
01:03:00,084 --> 01:03:02,856
I'm gonna read you a story,
and then it's bedtime.

606
01:03:02,858 --> 01:03:04,960
Story about murders?

607
01:03:04,962 --> 01:03:07,833
I think not, sweetheart.

608
01:03:13,445 --> 01:03:15,515
Would you like anything else?

609
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:19,022
I'm going to my room to read.

610
01:03:21,328 --> 01:03:23,263
Oh, Neve...

611
01:03:26,405 --> 01:03:28,140
Stop pushing me away.

612
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:29,209
We'll never get on

613
01:03:29,211 --> 01:03:31,948
if you keep on treating us
like your enemy.

614
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:35,087
Neve, my sweet little kitten...

615
01:03:36,725 --> 01:03:39,563
You can read downstairs,
with us.

616
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,233
I know it seems
like a nightmare,

617
01:03:41,235 --> 01:03:43,905
but one day it'll be better,
you'll see.

618
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:46,911
Trust us.

619
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:54,326
Stop it, Neve, please!

620
01:03:54,328 --> 01:03:56,263
You're gonna wake up
Ryan and Lucy.

621
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:58,701
It's just for tonight, we can't
let you sleep on your own.

622
01:03:58,703 --> 01:03:59,870
Wandering around
the countryside

623
01:03:59,872 --> 01:04:01,607
alone at night like that
is dangerous.

624
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:03,945
- Shh.

625
01:04:03,947 --> 01:04:06,116
Aaah!

626
01:04:09,124 --> 01:04:10,190
Aaah!

627
01:04:10,192 --> 01:04:11,761
Neve, stop it.
That's enough now.

628
01:04:11,763 --> 01:04:12,929
Stop screaming.

629
01:04:12,931 --> 01:04:15,167
Neve, please, Neve.
Stop it!

630
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,741
Neve...

631
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:20,812
I'm sorry.

632
01:04:21,581 --> 01:04:22,883
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

633
01:04:22,885 --> 01:04:24,586
I just wanted you
to stop screaming,

634
01:04:24,588 --> 01:04:26,824
and come to bed, I...

635
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,103
I just wanted you
to be a good girl.

636
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:50,405
No, no no.
No, Neve, what are you doing?

637
01:04:51,508 --> 01:04:52,743
Nat...

638
01:04:53,946 --> 01:04:56,751
She'll sleep in her room,
but I'll stay with her.

639
01:04:56,753 --> 01:04:58,454
It's just for one night.

640
01:04:58,456 --> 01:05:00,525
Can block up her window
tomorrow.

641
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,136
Come along, Neve.

642
01:05:26,143 --> 01:05:29,115
Go to sleep, please.
It's late.

643
01:05:42,877 --> 01:05:44,613
What the hell are you doing?!

644
01:05:57,607 --> 01:05:59,343
Who gave you these?

645
01:05:59,345 --> 01:06:01,981
I got them from
the album downstairs.

646
01:06:01,983 --> 01:06:03,651
I like them.

647
01:06:03,653 --> 01:06:05,421
What gives you the right?

648
01:06:05,423 --> 01:06:06,790
Who do you think you are?!

649
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:09,061
These are ours,
they're not yours!

650
01:06:09,063 --> 01:06:10,465
I forbid you to touch them!

651
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,736
Lucas, have you gone crazy?

652
01:06:12,738 --> 01:06:15,775
She took those,
she was playing with them.

653
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:19,783
Daddy!

654
01:06:19,785 --> 01:06:23,624
You go to them, I'll stay here.

655
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:25,962
Daddy!

656
01:06:27,265 --> 01:06:29,870
Neve, why would you take these?

657
01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:34,913
This is our little girl, Mary.

658
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,456
The one who got sick,
do you remember her?

659
01:06:43,932 --> 01:06:46,269
Why would you show them
to Lucas?

660
01:06:47,607 --> 01:06:51,045
It hurts us, we-
We loved her so much.

661
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,853
Then why is she dead?

662
01:06:56,925 --> 01:06:59,195
But Neve...

663
01:07:01,334 --> 01:07:03,437
That wasn't our fault.

664
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:06,310
She was seriously ill.

665
01:07:06,312 --> 01:07:08,447
There was nothing we could do.

666
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:11,750
We loved her,

667
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:14,393
and that had nothing to
do with her being ill.

668
01:07:25,849 --> 01:07:28,019
Try and get some sleep now.

669
01:07:44,855 --> 01:07:46,423
Mary...

670
01:07:48,429 --> 01:07:49,463
Mary...

671
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,337
Mary...

672
01:08:03,492 --> 01:08:06,229
Hi, my name is Olivia.

673
01:08:06,231 --> 01:08:07,732
Welcome.

674
01:08:07,734 --> 01:08:09,268
Neve, the other children
are in the garden.

675
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:10,738
Join them.

676
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:11,740
Look.

677
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,082
She's the prettiest doll
in the shop.

678
01:08:16,084 --> 01:08:17,919
Do you like her?

679
01:08:17,921 --> 01:08:19,556
Anne loves dolly parties.

680
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:20,992
Have you heard of them before?

681
01:08:21,862 --> 01:08:23,497
No.

682
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,703
I... I want to go home.

683
01:08:26,705 --> 01:08:28,374
I don't want it.

684
01:08:28,376 --> 01:08:30,177
Ah, we... we can't go home now,
sweetheart.

685
01:08:30,179 --> 01:08:32,214
That wouldn't be very nice
for Anne.

686
01:08:32,216 --> 01:08:34,319
Anyway, I'm sure you'll play
lots of other things,

687
01:08:34,321 --> 01:08:37,191
and there'll be cake,
and presents, and...

688
01:08:37,193 --> 01:08:40,297
I think Colette has even
organized a treasure hunt.

689
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:42,134
I'll be right here, okay?

690
01:08:46,678 --> 01:08:48,347
- Hello.
-  Hi!

691
01:08:48,349 --> 01:08:50,217
Are you coming to play?

692
01:08:51,354 --> 01:08:52,755
Have fun and be careful.

693
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:55,328
Give me a shout
when you're hungry.

694
01:09:04,212 --> 01:09:06,082
...so disgusting.

695
01:09:07,353 --> 01:09:09,288
Don't do it again.

696
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:10,825
They sound like
they're having fun.

697
01:09:10,827 --> 01:09:13,631
Yeah, it was a good idea
of yours.

698
01:09:13,633 --> 01:09:15,501
I'm so glad she came.

699
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:19,609
Hi, what's your name?

700
01:09:22,016 --> 01:09:24,486
...mentally sick people...

701
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:44,124
Are you feeling okay?

702
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:46,095
Do you want a glass of Coke?

703
01:09:46,097 --> 01:09:48,367
Can I see your doll?
She's lovely.

704
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:50,838
I don't like the dress.
It's pink.

705
01:09:52,108 --> 01:09:53,711
It should be blue.

706
01:09:53,713 --> 01:09:56,984
On second though,
she's not very lovely.

707
01:09:56,986 --> 01:09:58,854
Is she bold?
Do you have to punish her?

708
01:09:58,856 --> 01:10:01,258
Mine's crazy, I have to look
out.

709
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:05,133
Awake, asleep.

710
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:19,696
She's ugly and fat.

711
01:10:45,483 --> 01:10:47,718
Ooh...

712
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,090
It's not your ear again, is it?

713
01:11:01,647 --> 01:11:02,915
You really must see Gwendoline.

714
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:04,319
I'm sure it's tinnitus.

715
01:11:04,321 --> 01:11:05,788
I've got her number,
I'll go get it for you.

716
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,458
Thank you.

717
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:08,727
Hang on a sec.

718
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:28,467
Oh!

719
01:11:28,469 --> 01:11:31,038
Neve!
Get away from there, Neve!

720
01:11:39,122 --> 01:11:41,192
Neve, come here!

721
01:11:41,194 --> 01:11:42,862
Colette!

722
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:49,141
No...

723
01:11:49,944 --> 01:11:52,949
Neve, don't!

724
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:56,356
Be careful!
Get in the kitchen!

725
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:58,226
- Go on!
- Neve!

726
01:11:58,228 --> 01:12:00,063
Go, what are you doing?!

727
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:03,370
- Go, quickly, move!
- Neve!

728
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:07,378
Neve?

729
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:12,388
Neve?

730
01:12:30,992 --> 01:12:32,461
Yes, I'm fine.

731
01:12:32,463 --> 01:12:34,499
I'm out looking for her.

732
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:36,736
No, I want to be the one
to find her.

733
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:40,477
Are they hurt?

734
01:12:42,582 --> 01:12:44,719
Well, they're talking
a load of rubbish.

735
01:12:44,721 --> 01:12:47,391
Well, we left lit candles
on the table.

736
01:12:47,393 --> 01:12:49,629
It's our own fault.

737
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,368
What do you think Neve
is actually capable of?

738
01:12:55,575 --> 01:12:57,445
Well, what else
could it have been?

739
01:12:57,447 --> 01:12:58,680
No, I don't want to call Lucas.

740
01:12:58,682 --> 01:12:59,582
I want to find her myself.

741
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:01,686
He's looking after
the other two.

742
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:51,379
Neve?

743
01:17:05,775 --> 01:17:07,644
Neve?

744
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:35,402
Who's there?
Who is that?

745
01:17:40,378 --> 01:17:42,381
Neve...

746
01:17:43,817 --> 01:17:45,687
You frightened me.

747
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:53,636
Neve.

748
01:18:28,574 --> 01:18:30,810
- Neve...

749
01:18:33,785 --> 01:18:35,787
Who's screaming like that?

750
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:59,233
Don't be afraid.

751
01:19:10,023 --> 01:19:11,291
Neve.

752
01:19:16,937 --> 01:19:18,773
Neve?

753
01:19:18,775 --> 01:19:20,343
Where are you?

754
01:19:20,978 --> 01:19:22,814
What's going on?

755
01:19:24,151 --> 01:19:26,822
Neve, please say something.

756
01:19:28,861 --> 01:19:29,895
What...

757
01:19:30,764 --> 01:19:33,436
What did they do
to you and your brother?

758
01:19:56,816 --> 01:19:58,953
Neve, help me.

759
01:19:58,955 --> 01:20:00,590
I've hurt myself.

760
01:20:36,529 --> 01:20:38,231
Lucas...

761
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:40,570
I'm in Henry and Maud's house.

762
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:43,509
Neve...

763
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:46,180
Neve, give me my phone back.

764
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,233
What's going on here, Neve?

765
01:21:29,235 --> 01:21:31,572
What the hell are you doing?

766
01:21:31,574 --> 01:21:32,407
Answer me.

767
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:33,709
Answer me, Neve.

768
01:21:33,711 --> 01:21:35,413
Answer me!

769
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,895
Gently.

770
01:23:07,665 --> 01:23:09,734
Don't be afraid.

771
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:11,672
Let me do it.

772
01:23:13,411 --> 01:23:15,513
See?
It isn't hot.

773
01:23:32,046 --> 01:23:34,818
You're tired.
You're hungry.

774
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,555
But be good children.

775
01:23:36,557 --> 01:23:39,427
Mommy and Daddy are tired, too.

776
01:24:16,302 --> 01:24:18,171
Arrgh!

777
01:24:18,173 --> 01:24:19,574
Aah!

778
01:24:37,945 --> 01:24:38,946
You talked to the children

779
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:40,750
about what they said at school?

780
01:24:41,519 --> 01:24:43,322
Not yet.

781
01:24:43,324 --> 01:24:46,160
They'll have to be punished.

782
01:24:46,162 --> 01:24:49,166
They don't realize
everything we do for them.

783
01:24:52,441 --> 01:24:54,243
Back then...

784
01:24:54,245 --> 01:24:56,948
people didn't used to get
involved in education.

785
01:24:56,950 --> 01:25:00,389
Nowadays, everybody has
their own opinion.

786
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,787
Are you giving me
a goodnight kiss?
