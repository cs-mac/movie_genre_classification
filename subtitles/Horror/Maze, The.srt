1
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,928
Remember... I love you.

2
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,683
I love you, Thomas.

3
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,398
Mom!

4
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,529
Mom!

5
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,087
Thomas...

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,924
it's okay.

7
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,235
No, no, no!

8
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,613
<i>Thomas</i>!

9
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,114
<i>Thomas</i>!

10
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,244
Thomas!

11
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,871
Wake up! We gotta go! Come on!

12
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,042
Let's go! Let's go! We gotta go!

13
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,211
You all right? You all right?

14
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,379
Wait, wait, wait!

15
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,172
Where are you going?

16
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,924
We don't have time!

17
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,134
Come on!

18
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,594
Get out of here!

19
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,889
Cranks! We got Cranks!

20
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,891
Gotta move! Not safe out here, kid!

21
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,268
Got a swarm to the flank!

22
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,602
Go, kid! Go, go!

23
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:09,481
Set a perimeter!
Hold them back on the right side!

24
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,281
Come on, kids, let's go!
Let's go! Move it! Come on!

25
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,119
Keep moving! Keep moving!

26
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,458
Tell him to take off! We're clear!

27
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,757
You kids doing all right?

28
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,929
Sorry about all the fuss.
We had ourselves a bit of a swarm.

29
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,680
Who are you?

30
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,892
I'm the reason you're all still alive.

31
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:29,144
It's my intention to keep you that way.

32
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,856
Now, come with me.
We'll get you kids squared away.

33
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,987
You can call me Mr. Janson.
I run this place.

34
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:45,118
For us it is a sanctuary,
safe from the horrors of the outside world.

35
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,747
You all should think of it
as a way station.

36
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,542
Kind of a home between homes.
Watch yourselves.

37
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,503
That mean you're taking us home?

38
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,214
A home of sorts.

39
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,759
Sadly, there wouldn't be much left
of wherever you came from.

40
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,427
But we do have a place for you.

41
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:08,142
A refuge, outside the Scorch,
where WICKED will never find you again.

42
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,144
How does that sound?

43
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,814
Why are you helping us?

44
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,817
Let's just say the world out there
is in a rather precarious situation.

45
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,194
We're all hanging on
by a very thin thread.

46
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,488
The fact that you kids
can survive the Flare virus...

47
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,617
makes you the best chance
of humanity's continued survival.

48
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:32,166
Unfortunately, it also makes you a target,
as no doubt by now you've noticed.

49
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,087
Beyond this door lies the beginning
of your new lives.

50
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,050
First things first...

51
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,262
let's do something about that smell.

52
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,723
All right!

53
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,183
Oh, man!

54
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,350
Feels great!

55
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,061
Frypan, how you feel over there?

56
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,332
Wait, what is that?

57
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,127
Just a little cocktail.
Calcium, folate, vitamins A through Z.

58
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,005
Pretty much everything
you've been deprived of out there.

59
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,507
Try to relax.

60
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,437
Sure you got enough there?

61
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,023
Evening, Dr. Crawford.

62
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,484
Good evening.
How are the new arrivals holding up?

63
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,069
So far, so good.

64
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,779
All right.

65
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,406
And you must be Teresa.

66
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,494
Thomas?

67
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,872
Yeah?

68
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,707
Come with me, please.

69
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,524
Thomas, thank you for seeing me.

70
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:22,693
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

71
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:27,156
I was just hoping we might get a moment
to chat in private, away from the others.

72
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,117
Well...

73
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,079
I won't take up
too much of your time.

74
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,749
I really only have one question.

75
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,755
What do you remember about WICKED?

76
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,758
You're not in trouble.

77
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,929
We're just having a conversation.
I'm just trying to understand.

78
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,765
Understand what?

79
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,144
Whose side are you on?

80
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,113
I remember I used to work for WICKED.

81
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,035
I remember that they sent me
into the maze.

82
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,250
I remember watching my friends die
in front of me.

83
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,091
I'm on their side.

84
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,844
Interesting.

85
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,308
You say you worked for WICKED,
but they sent you into the maze.

86
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,893
Why would they do something like that?

87
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:41,063
I don't know. Maybe you should've
asked them before you killed them all.

88
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,277
I'll be sure to keep that in mind.

89
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,155
Enjoy the rest of your stay.

90
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,324
That's it?

91
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,368
Yeah, you've told me
everything I need to know.

92
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,663
You and your friends have all
been cleared to join the others.

93
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,833
Soon you'll all be moving
on to greener pastures.

94
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,001
Wait.

95
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,130
Others?

96
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,146
Hey, Thomas!

97
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,773
Hey, Minho, what's going on?

98
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,692
We weren't the only maze.
Come on.

99
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,324
And there was this big, loud explosion,
and these guys came out of nowhere.

100
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,369
Started shooting up the place.

101
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,620
It was intense.

102
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,206
They pulled us out of the maze
and brought us here.

103
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,708
What about the rest?

104
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,586
The other people left behind in the maze,
what happened to them?

105
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:47,880
I don't know.

106
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,048
I guess WICKED still has them.

107
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,261
-How long you guys been here?
-Not long.

108
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,971
Just a day or two.

109
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,432
That kid over there has been here
the longest.

110
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,185
Almost a week.

111
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,395
His maze was nothing but girls.

112
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,647
Really?

113
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,817
Some guys have all the luck.

114
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,070
Good evening, gentlemen. Ladies.

115
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,449
You all know how this works.
If you hear your name called...

116
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:19,244
please rise in an orderly fashion,
join my colleagues behind me...

117
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,038
where they will escort you
to the eastern wing.

118
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,290
Your new lives are about to begin.

119
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,048
Connor.

120
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,551
Evelyn.

121
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,344
Ev!

122
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,553
Justin.

123
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,807
Peter.

124
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,850
Allison.

125
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,436
Squiggy.

126
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,189
All right. Settle down.

127
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,485
Franklin. And Abigail.

128
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,407
Now, now, don't get discouraged.
If I could take more, I would.

129
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:02,162
There's always tomorrow.
Your time will come.

130
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,122
Go on, eat up.

131
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,211
Where are they going?

132
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,129
Far from here.

133
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,300
Lucky bastards.

134
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,514
Some kind of farm. A safe place.

135
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:23,016
They can only take in
a couple of people at a time.

136
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,731
What the hell?

137
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,694
Hey, Teresa?

138
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:36,989
Teresa!

139
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,324
Hey, hey, hey.

140
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,952
Where are they taking her?

141
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,413
They just have to run a few more tests.

142
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,748
Don't worry,
they'll be done with her soon.

143
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,500
Is she okay?

144
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,419
She's fine.

145
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,141
I got top bunk.

146
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,935
Too slow.

147
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,482
I could get used to this.

148
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,692
Yeah. It's not bad.

149
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,531
Hey, what do you think
those guys want with Teresa?

150
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:23,952
Now, if there's one thing I know about that girl,
she can take care of herself.

151
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,039
Don't worry about it.

152
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,025
Hey.

153
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,320
Down here.

154
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,533
Oh, my God.

155
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,786
Come on. Follow me.

156
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,204
What?

157
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,044
Hurry, this way.

158
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,214
Come on.

159
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,896
Hey, wait a second.
What the hell are we doing?

160
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,898
Come on, we're gonna miss it.

161
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,904
What the hell am I doing?

162
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,494
What are we doing?

163
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,663
Come here.

164
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,086
Watch.

165
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,631
What the hell was that?

166
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,300
They bring in new ones every night
like clockwork.

167
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,094
You know what they do with them?

168
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:50,265
I don't know.
This is as far as I've ever gotten.

169
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,767
The vents don't even go
into that section.

170
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,772
But once they go through that door,
they don't come back out.

171
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,860
I don't think anybody
ever really leaves this place.

172
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,659
Come on. We've gotta go
before somebody notices we're gone.

173
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,869
Why did you show me this?

174
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,458
Because maybe the others
will listen to you.

175
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,255
There's something weird going on here.
And I know you think so too.

176
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,717
Hey, wait.

177
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,678
What's your name?

178
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,680
Aris.

179
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,186
<i>Alice</i>.

180
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,022
Barry.

181
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,360
Walt.

182
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,029
Edgar.

183
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,323
Samantha.

184
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,450
I wanna know what's through that door.

185
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,452
Aaron.

186
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,912
Now, we've been over this.

187
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,373
You said they were covered up,
so you don't know what you saw.

188
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,749
-Dennis.
-It could've been anything under there.

189
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,585
I know exactly what I saw.
They were bodies.

190
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,419
Sally.

191
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,713
Aris said they bring in
a new batch every night.

192
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,298
Who the hell is Aris?

193
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,340
Henry.

194
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,051
Tim.

195
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:11,180
Well, I'm sold.

196
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,016
And last but not least, David.

197
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,896
Thank you for your attention.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

198
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,986
Okay, until we know anything for certain,
we should just keep our heads down...

199
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,697
and try not to draw any attention
to ourselves, all right?

200
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,411
What is he doing?

201
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,787
I think he's drawing attention to himself.

202
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,627
Hang on. You weren't called.

203
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,753
I know, I'm just gonna be a second.

204
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,546
This is a restricted area, kid.

205
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,301
I just wanna see my friend.
Can you let me through?

206
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,596
Get your ass back in that chair.

207
00:16:55,557 --> 00:17:00,103
<i>Just remember, you are always being monitored.
Breaking the rules..</i>.

208
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,272
Back off!

209
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,358
What's your problem, man?
What the hell, huh?

210
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,359
Back off!

211
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,860
Why won't you let me see her?

212
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:07,945
Control your friend!

213
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,154
What's happening here?

214
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,200
Thomas?

215
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,118
I thought we could trust each other.

216
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,499
You know we're all
on the same team here.

217
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,627
Are we?

218
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,469
Get them to their bunks.

219
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,222
Get your asses in there! All of you!

220
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,269
What the hell was that about?

221
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,187
You didn't really think
they were just gonna let you through?

222
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,814
Nah, of course I didn't.

223
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:47,609
I'm gonna find out
what's on the other side of that door.

224
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:48,735
Right.

225
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,779
Newt, they're hiding something. Okay?

226
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,531
These people are not
who they say they are.

227
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:53,615
No, Thomas, you don't know that!

228
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:58,579
The only thing that we do know
is that they helped rescue us from WICKED.

229
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,665
They gave us new clothes. They gave us food.
They gave us a proper bed.

230
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,709
Some of us haven't had that
in a long time.

231
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,543
Yeah, but...

232
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,587
Some of us a lot longer than others.

233
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,883
Hey, Thomas.

234
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:11,925
What the...

235
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,427
You got it, didn't you?

236
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:15,429
Yeah. Let's go.

237
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:19,183
All right, look, maybe you guys are right.
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

238
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,770
But I got to find out for sure.
Just cover for me.

239
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,314
I'll be back as soon as I can.

240
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,967
What the hell?

241
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:20,637
Teresa?

242
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,614
It's Rachel.

243
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,494
They took her the first night.

244
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,915
I told her it was going to be okay.

245
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:00,052
You sure this can't wait?

246
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,596
She was very specific, sir.

247
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,223
She wanted to speak with you personally.

248
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,683
As if I don't have enough to deal with.

249
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:11,313
Just bear with me.
I'm getting some interference from the storm.

250
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,857
Come on. It's good enough.
Make the connection.

251
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,778
Good evening, Doctor Paige.

252
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,446
Lovely to see you again.

253
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,864
Although I admit...

254
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,867
I wasn't expecting to hear from you
quite so soon.

255
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:25,661
<i>Change of plans, Janson</i>.

256
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:29,373
<i>I'll be arriving a little sooner than expected.
First thing tomorrow</i>.

257
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,793
We'll be delighted to have you.

258
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,629
I think you'll be pleased
with the progress we've made.

259
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:41,093
As you can see, early results
have been extremely promising.

260
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:45,722
Whatever it is you've been doing
to them in there, it's working.

261
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,186
<i>Not well enough</i>.

262
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,814
<i>I just received board approval</i>.

263
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:58,443
<i>I want all the remaining subjects sedated
and prepped for harvest by the time I arrive</i>.

264
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:02,072
Doctor Paige, we are going
as fast as we can.

265
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:03,323
We are still running tests...

266
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,075
<i>Try something faster</i>.

267
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,746
<i>Until I can guarantee their security,
this is the best plan</i>.

268
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,792
Ma'am, security is my job.
We're on 24 hour lockdown here.

269
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,377
I am assuring you...

270
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,921
the assets are secure.

271
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:20,090
<i>Have you found the Right Arm</i>?

272
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,134
Not yet.

273
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,887
We tracked them as far as the mountains.

274
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,305
<i>So they're still out there</i>.

275
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,765
<i>And they've already hit
two of our installations</i>.

276
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:32,352
<i>They want these kids as badly as we do.
And I cannot..</i>.

277
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:36,440
<i>I cannot afford another loss</i>.

278
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:39,109
<i>Not now, when I am so close to a cure</i>.

279
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,324
<i>If you are not up to the task,
I will find someone who is</i>.

280
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,950
That won't be necessary.

281
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,914
Might I suggest we start
with the most recent arrivals.

282
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,291
<i>Just get it done</i>.

283
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,211
<i>Janson</i>.

284
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,632
<i>I don't want them to feel any pain</i>.

285
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,802
They won't feel a thing.

286
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,368
Thomas!

287
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,788
We gotta go.
We gotta go right now.

288
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,790
-What the hell are you talking about?
-What do you mean, "We gotta go?"

289
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:36,500
They're coming. Come on. We gotta go.

290
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:37,751
They're coming for us.

291
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,883
-Paige. She's still alive.
-What happened in there?

292
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:45,968
Aris, what happened?

293
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,678
Thomas, can you just calm down
and talk to us.

294
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,638
-She's still alive.
-Who's she? Teresa?

295
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,639
Ava.

296
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:51,557
Ava?

297
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,016
Will you just turn around and talk to us?

298
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,351
It's WICKED!

299
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,146
It's still WICKED.

300
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,188
It's always been WICKED.

301
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,614
Thomas.

302
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,785
What did you see?

303
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,324
Come on, come on.

304
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:52,951
Okay, let's go.

305
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,536
You guys go ahead.
There's something I gotta do.

306
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:55,746
What are you talking about?

307
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:59,208
Trust me, it's important. You guys wanna
get outta here, right? Just go.

308
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,209
I'll go with him.

309
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,877
Okay, Winston, go! Go! Come on.

310
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,212
You sure we can trust this kid?

311
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,630
You don't want to know
where we'd be without him.

312
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,636
What are you kids doing out?

313
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,896
I want this place locked down.
Call everyone in.

314
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:22,815
No one leaves until
everyone's accounted for.

315
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,441
Tell me you've got eyes on them.

316
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,943
Still looking, still looking.

317
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,861
Come on, come on, come on.

318
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:30,656
There.

319
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,243
Who is that?

320
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,913
Crawford. Going after the girl.

321
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,164
Get everyone to the med wing.

322
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:40,207
Yes, sir.

323
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,250
I want them alive.

324
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:47,965
Freeze!

325
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:48,924
Stay where you are!

326
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,803
-Why are they shooting at us?
-I've spotted them!

327
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,096
-They're in L-3!
-Minho!

328
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:55,848
-I'm in pursuit!
-What the hell are you doing?

329
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,057
Minho!

330
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,108
Shit, Minho!

331
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:11,071
Okay. Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

332
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:19,788
Dr. Crawford, are you here to...

333
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,999
Wait, wait. Okay, okay.

334
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,752
Where is she? Where is she!

335
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,259
Get over!

336
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:33,969
Get down!

337
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,179
-Teresa.
-Get down!

338
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,097
-Okay, hands, give me your hands!
-Just do what he says.

339
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,307
What did they do to you?

340
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:39,266
Thomas?

341
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,184
Give me your hands!

342
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:42,102
You're never gonna get away with this.

343
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:43,228
What's going on?

344
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,730
We gotta leave right now.
Come on.

345
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,773
Guys? They're coming! Where do we go?

346
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,275
Frypan! Move!

347
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,614
Get back! Get back!

348
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,241
They've got the door barricaded.
Send backup!

349
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:57,701
Okay, we gotta get outta here!

350
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:58,869
Where do we go?

351
00:26:58,911 --> 00:26:59,870
Push!

352
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:01,163
Everyone stand back!

353
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:02,539
Come on!

354
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,249
Newt! Help, help!

355
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:05,626
Ready?

356
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:08,587
Go, go, go!

357
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:09,671
Get out of the way!

358
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:10,506
Come on, come on!

359
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,050
-Come on, come on!
-Get someone on the other side!

360
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,468
Watch your feet!

361
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,470
-Hurry! Let's go!
-Come on, move! Move! Move!

362
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,180
Thomas!

363
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:19,515
Let's go!

364
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:21,809
Stay behind me!

365
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:31,109
Shit. Okay, come on!

366
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,405
Stop!

367
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,243
There it is! There it is!

368
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:40,994
<i>Converge on level 3</i>.

369
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,663
<i>All R-16 personnel..</i>.

370
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,873
<i>non-lethal force only</i>.

371
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:47,960
Shit. Come on!

372
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,753
No, no, no!

373
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:51,088
Thomas!

374
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,846
Open this door, Janson!

375
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:00,180
You really don't want me to.

376
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,557
Open the damn door!

377
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:04,476
Listen to me!
I'm trying to save your life.

378
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,979
The maze is one thing, but you kids
wouldn't last one day...

379
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,106
out in the Scorch.

380
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:11,567
If the elements don't kill you,
the Cranks will.

381
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:15,195
Thomas, you have to believe me.

382
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:18,782
I only want what's best for you.

383
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:22,119
Yeah, let me guess. WICKED is good?

384
00:28:25,664 --> 00:28:27,875
You're not getting through
that door, Thomas.

385
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,006
Hey, guys.

386
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,424
Come on!

387
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,593
Thomas! Come on! Let's go!

388
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,185
Go, go. Stop him!

389
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,853
Shut the main vault door!

390
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,482
-No!
-Thomas?

391
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,275
Come on, Thomas! Come on!

392
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,198
-Move! Move!
-Thomas, what's going on?

393
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,127
Come on.

394
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:13,587
You little shit.

395
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:17,216
Come on, Thomas. Let's go. Come on!

396
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,721
Come on. Keep moving!

397
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,724
Come on. Come on!

398
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,946
Come on, come on!

399
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,410
Fan out!

400
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,372
All right, come on. Keep going!

401
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:50,999
Shit.

402
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:56,964
Come on, go! Go!
We'll lose them in the storm!

403
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:00,926
<i>Notify on visual</i>.

404
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:01,927
<i>Copy that</i>.

405
00:30:01,969 --> 00:30:03,720
<i>Standby, Two.
Be on my six</i>.

406
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,109
Everybody, go, go, go.
Stay low. Stay low!

407
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,576
Teresa, hang on. Stay together!

408
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,035
I think we lost them!

409
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,579
Keep going, guys. Let's go.

410
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,415
Watch out! Where are we even going?

411
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,375
Come on, Aris. Let's go. Come on!

412
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,793
Over here!

413
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:39,214
Come on!

414
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:40,716
Teresa, wait!
No, don't go in there!

415
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:41,758
Get down here!

416
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:43,594
-Okay, come on!
-Get inside!

417
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:45,888
Come on, we should go.

418
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,222
Aris, get in!

419
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:48,557
Let's go, Fry.

420
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:53,896
Can you hold onto this?

421
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,074
Where the hell are we?

422
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:08,577
We gotta go.

423
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,162
-No. Thomas, stop!
-We gotta keep moving.

424
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,333
Tell me what's going on.

425
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,296
It's WICKED.

426
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:22,174
It's WICKED. They lied to us.
We never escaped.

427
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:24,426
Me and Aris, we found bodies.

428
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,428
Too many to count.

429
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,639
What do you mean? Dead bodies?

430
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,809
No, but they weren't alive either.

431
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,145
They had them strung up.

432
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,940
With tubes coming out of them.

433
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,152
They were being drained.

434
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:47,324
There's something inside
of us that WICKED wants.

435
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,160
Something in our blood.

436
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,956
So we have to get as far away
from them as possible.

437
00:31:57,668 --> 00:32:01,171
Okay. So, what's the plan?

438
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,258
You do have a plan, right?

439
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,135
Yeah. I don't know.

440
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:07,970
Well, we followed you
out here, Thomas...

441
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,972
and now you're saying that you have no idea
where we're going...

442
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,307
or what we're doing.

443
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:20,149
Wait. Janson said something
about people hiding in the mountains.

444
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,693
Some kind of resistance or army.

445
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,027
The Right Arm.

446
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:29,825
The Right Arm. If they're really
against WICKED, maybe they can help us.

447
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:35,455
People. In the mountains.
Mountain people.

448
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,666
That's your plan?

449
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:41,920
It's the only chance we have.

450
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:44,173
Hey, guys.

451
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,133
Check this out.

452
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:47,593
Minho, give me a light!

453
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,724
Someone's been down here.

454
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,073
Come on. Open up.

455
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:27,966
Looks like people lived here.

456
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,845
Where are they now?

457
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,851
Let's pack some of this stuff up.

458
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:40,437
Anything you think you might need.

459
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,856
We'll split up, see what else we can find.
Meet back here.

460
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,150
Wait, Thomas.

461
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:47,319
Let's go.

462
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:05,587
Thomas.

463
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:06,630
Yeah?

464
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,967
All those kids that we
left behind back there.

465
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:13,178
I don't want to end up like that.

466
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,349
Hey.

467
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,686
Do you hear me?

468
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,106
Yeah, I hear you.

469
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:27,860
Good. Now, what are we
looking for out here?

470
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,114
Signs of life.

471
00:34:32,156 --> 00:34:36,577
People. Survivors.
Anyone who can help us.

472
00:34:40,038 --> 00:34:41,415
Does he count?

473
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,346
Shit.

474
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:06,940
They had power.

475
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:40,557
You all right?

476
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,769
I'm fine.

477
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,287
What?

478
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,010
Where did you go?

479
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,397
This looks promising.

480
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:22,409
Hey, Minho. Wait!

481
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:36,924
Thomas, watch out!

482
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,091
Get back, get back!

483
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:39,760
Jesus.

484
00:37:39,802 --> 00:37:41,178
Her eyes!

485
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,307
Oh, shit.

486
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:48,143
Stay back!

487
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,563
What the hell is that thing?

488
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:56,318
Gotta move! Go!

489
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,322
Go!

490
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:04,993
-Hold it down!
-What?

491
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:07,830
-Hold it down!
-Minho, what are you doing?

492
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,583
Watch out! Watch out!

493
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,508
Go, go, go!

494
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:23,595
Let's get the hell out of here!

495
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:28,559
Shit.

496
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:30,686
What's going on?

497
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:31,937
I don't know.

498
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,190
Hey!

499
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:37,734
Hey!

500
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:38,569
Run!

501
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,572
Go!

502
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:44,992
Shit!

503
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:46,243
Hey!

504
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:48,120
Go!

505
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:49,329
Get outta here!

506
00:38:49,705 --> 00:38:51,039
Run!

507
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,082
Come on!

508
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,752
Let's go, go, go!

509
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:58,630
Let's go!

510
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,466
Thomas, Minho,
what the hell are those things?

511
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,051
I don't know. Just keep going!

512
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:05,220
Move! Move!

513
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:06,847
Where do we go?

514
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,807
Come on, keep moving!

515
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,397
-Aris, no!
-No!

516
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,657
Go! Go around!

517
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,576
Teresa!

518
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:37,836
Minho, come on!

519
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,173
Come on, come on!

520
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:43,884
Where the hell are we gonna go?

521
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,678
We gotta find a way out of here!

522
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:48,305
Go!

523
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:49,765
Faster, faster!

524
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,311
Newt! Newt!

525
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:55,646
Guys, help!

526
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:02,903
Newt, you good?

527
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:05,239
Yeah. Thanks, Tommy.

528
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,116
-Come on, Newt!
-Keep going!

529
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,452
Through here, through here!
Let's go! They're coming!

530
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:15,499
Guys, where are we going?

531
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,167
Okay, run! Go! Go!

532
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:25,467
-Just keep going!
-Come on, they're coming!

533
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:29,763
It's a dead end!

534
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,974
Get us out of here, Thomas!

535
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,350
This one!

536
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,313
I'll hold them back!

537
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,356
Harder!

538
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,656
Get that door open!

539
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:48,824
Move!

540
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,534
Come on, Frypan! Let's go!

541
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,035
Come on! It's open!

542
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,497
Everyone through!
Come on! Come on!

543
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:57,541
Winston!

544
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,002
Help me!

545
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,503
Help! Please!

546
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,465
Please! Oh, my God!

547
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,180
Go, go, go!

548
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:13,223
-Get up, Winston!
-Hurry!

549
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,850
Minho, go! I'm right behind you!

550
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:15,976
Let's go! Let's go!

551
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:44,087
Thomas. Get in.

552
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,407
Hey! Get out of here!

553
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:25,462
Are they gone?

554
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:28,257
Yeah, I think we're safe for now.

555
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:32,094
Okay, we should get moving.

556
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:33,929
Let's pack it up.

557
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:35,139
Aris, come on.

558
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,141
Fry, Winston. Let's go.

559
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:41,019
Hey, man.

560
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:43,981
You okay?

561
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:31,195
What the hell happened to this place?

562
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,988
I don't know.

563
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:36,366
It doesn't look like anyone's been here
in a long time.

564
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:40,746
I hope the whole world's not like this.

565
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,876
Hang on, stop.

566
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,089
Do you hear that?

567
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:02,351
Get down!

568
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:03,936
Everybody, hide! Hide! Hide!

569
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:05,979
Get in here. In here, in here!

570
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:15,489
Oh, shit.

571
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:30,587
They're never gonna stop looking for us,
are they?

572
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:43,433
Everyone good?

573
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:45,769
Yeah.

574
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,119
A little further, guys.

575
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:16,300
Those mountains, that's gotta be it.

576
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:18,969
That's where we're going.

577
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,806
That's a long way off.

578
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:26,143
Then we better get moving.

579
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:30,189
Winston! Hey, Winston!

580
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:36,153
Winston!

581
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:37,654
Winston!

582
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:38,822
He's hurt pretty bad.

583
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:40,824
What do we do?

584
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:44,661
Shit.

585
00:45:45,496 --> 00:45:47,206
Winston. Can you hear me?

586
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:50,000
It's okay.

587
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:02,137
Hang in there, Winston.

588
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:12,272
Thomas.

589
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:13,941
Grab his legs.

590
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:15,359
I got him, I got him.

591
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:30,123
Gotta find shelter!

592
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:38,882
Thanks.

593
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:01,029
It's like they're getting further away.

594
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:04,741
We just gotta keep moving.
We can make it.

595
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,578
How's it looking?

596
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:12,541
It's a little further.

597
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:17,880
That's not very convincing.

598
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:22,593
Hey, what's going on with you?

599
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:27,264
They did something to me.

600
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:37,941
At first it just felt like I was waking up
from a dream or something.

601
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,696
Then they all started coming back.

602
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:44,948
Your memories?

603
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:47,910
What do you remember?

604
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:52,789
I remember the first time
they brought you in.

605
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:58,253
I was taller than you then. And faster.

606
00:47:58,295 --> 00:47:59,546
Okay.

607
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:06,261
And I remember why we were there.

608
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:11,642
We thought we could fix all this.

609
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:23,612
I think we should go back.

610
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:28,242
-What?
-Just listen to me.

611
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:30,994
What are you talking about? Go back?
After everything they've done to us.

612
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:32,204
No, it's not that simple.

613
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:33,580
Yeah, I think it is that simple.

614
00:48:33,622 --> 00:48:35,958
No. You don't understand.

615
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:37,626
What don't I understand?

616
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:39,628
Everything was fine until you...

617
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:42,130
What?

618
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:47,219
Nothing.

619
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:51,014
Teresa, what aren't you telling me?

620
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:55,519
Hey!

621
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:56,687
Guys, get down here!

622
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,397
Winston what are you doing, man?

623
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:00,274
-Give me that!
-What's going on?

624
00:49:00,315 --> 00:49:01,567
-What happened?
-I don't know.

625
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:03,443
He just woke up and grabbed the gun
and then he tried to...

626
00:49:03,485 --> 00:49:04,903
Give it back, please.

627
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:06,113
Winston, are you okay?

628
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:22,254
It's growing...

629
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:24,673
inside me.

630
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:39,313
I'm not gonna make it.

631
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:45,486
Please. Please.

632
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:49,406
Don't let me turn
into one of those things.

633
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:06,048
Wait, Newt...

634
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:22,481
Thank you.

635
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:29,530
Now, get outta here.

636
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:34,993
Good-bye, Winston.

637
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:51,885
Go.

638
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:16,577
It's okay.

639
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:21,331
I'm sorry.

640
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:31,008
Thomas.

641
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:32,634
Take care of them.

642
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:15,511
I thought we were supposed to be immune.

643
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,057
Not all of us, I guess.

644
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:24,144
If Winston can get infected...

645
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:26,563
we should assume so can the rest of us.

646
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:32,152
I never thought I'd say it...

647
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:38,075
I miss the Glade.

648
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:53,317
Hey. Hey.

649
00:53:54,902 --> 00:53:55,777
Get up.

650
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:59,406
Newt, get up. Come on, let's go.
Frypan, Aris.

651
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:00,532
I see something.

652
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:01,742
What is it? What...

653
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:03,994
You see that?

654
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:07,873
It's lights.

655
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:10,125
We made it.

656
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:21,512
Let's go. We gotta go.
Come on.

657
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,472
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

658
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:36,318
Hurry!

659
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,319
Go!

660
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:38,987
Run!

661
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:42,658
Keep moving! Come on!

662
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:43,742
Let's go!

663
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:48,914
Come on, Teresa!

664
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,040
Go, go, go!

665
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:51,375
We're getting closer!

666
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:54,670
Keep going!

667
00:55:03,804 --> 00:55:05,556
Get inside! Go!

668
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:09,143
Oh, shi-...

669
00:55:22,156 --> 00:55:23,448
Minho!

670
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:32,249
Come help him!

671
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:40,132
Come on, get him up.

672
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,721
Keep going!

673
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:47,890
Go!

674
00:55:50,601 --> 00:55:51,560
Move!

675
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:52,936
Come on! Hurry up!

676
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:54,897
Come on! Get in.

677
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:58,942
Put him down.

678
00:55:58,984 --> 00:56:00,068
Watch his head.

679
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,612
Who's got a light?

680
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,198
Minho!

681
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:07,493
-Come on, come on.
-Minho?

682
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:08,827
Minho?

683
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:10,204
Come on, Minho.

684
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:14,917
Come on, man.

685
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:23,383
There he is.

686
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:24,551
There you go.

687
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:26,887
Here you are. Are you okay?

688
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:29,640
What happened?

689
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,228
I think you got struck by lightning.

690
00:56:38,899 --> 00:56:40,275
Come on, let's get him up.

691
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,735
Nice and slow.

692
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:43,403
Okay.

693
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:44,571
Let's get him up.

694
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:45,781
Think you can get up?

695
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,615
Yeah?

696
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:51,245
Oh, my God.

697
00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:56,124
Thanks, guys.

698
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,125
Hey.

699
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:01,588
What's that smell?

700
00:57:07,845 --> 00:57:08,846
Behind you!

701
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:19,314
Oh, shit! Oh, my God.

702
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,360
I see you've met our guard dogs.

703
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:26,989
Who's that?

704
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:37,374
Stay back! Stay back!

705
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,379
You guys look like shit.

706
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,008
Come on. Follow me.

707
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:51,096
Unless you want to stay here with them.

708
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,028
Oh, my.

709
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:09,615
Come on, keep up.

710
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:11,700
Jorge wants to meet you.

711
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:18,040
Who's Jorge?

712
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:21,502
You'll see.

713
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:25,255
No one's come out of the Scorch
in a long time.

714
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:27,758
You've just got him curious.

715
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,178
And me, too.

716
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,771
Anyone else starting to get
a bad feeling about this place?

717
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:43,315
Let's just hear him out.
See what he has to say.

718
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:53,659
Jorge, they're here.

719
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:56,119
Quiet.

720
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:01,500
Damn it.

721
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:16,181
Do you ever get the feeling
the whole world's against you?

722
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:23,981
Three questions.
Where did you come from?

723
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:26,692
Where are you going?

724
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:28,819
How can I profit?

725
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:36,368
Don't all answer at once.

726
00:59:37,327 --> 00:59:41,498
We're headed for the mountains.
Looking for the Right Arm.

727
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,336
You're looking for ghosts, you mean.

728
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:54,052
Question number two.

729
00:59:56,513 --> 00:59:58,557
Where did you come from?

730
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:01,226
That's our business.

731
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:06,482
Hey!

732
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:07,983
Get the hell off me!

733
01:00:08,025 --> 01:00:09,735
Get the hell off me, man!

734
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:13,739
Shut up, you big baby.

735
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:15,699
What is that?

736
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:22,289
You were right.

737
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,877
Right about what?
What is she talking about?

738
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:31,381
I'm sorry, <i>hermano</i>.

739
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:33,884
Looks like you're tagged.

740
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,055
You came from WICKED.

741
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,100
Which means...

742
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:46,730
you're very valuable.

743
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:01,912
Good plan, Thomas.
"Just hear what the man has to say."

744
01:01:02,246 --> 01:01:03,914
Really working out for us.

745
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:05,457
Shut up, Minho.

746
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:08,085
Maybe I can reach the rope.

747
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:16,093
Enjoying the view?

748
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:20,472
What the hell do you want?

749
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:24,059
That is the question.

750
01:01:24,601 --> 01:01:28,230
My men want to sell you back to WICKED.

751
01:01:28,814 --> 01:01:33,068
Life has taught them to think small.
I'm not like that.

752
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,529
Something tells me
that you're not either.

753
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:39,158
Is the blood rushing to my head
or is this shank not making any sense?

754
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:45,122
Tell me what you know
about the Right Arm.

755
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:47,791
I thought you said they were ghosts.

756
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:50,127
I happen to believe in ghosts.

757
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:55,424
Especially when I hear them
chattering on the airwaves.

758
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:07,811
You tell me what you know,
and maybe we can make a deal.

759
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:12,983
We don't know much.

760
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:17,821
Okay! Okay, all right.

761
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:20,407
They're hiding in the mountains.

762
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:22,993
And they attacked WICKED.
They got out a bunch of kids.

763
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,495
That's it. That's all we know.

764
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,000
Yo, Jorge.

765
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:34,171
What's going on?

766
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:37,716
Me and my new friends
were just getting acquainted.

767
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,010
We're done now.

768
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:44,223
Hey, wait. You're not gonna help us?

769
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:49,478
Don't worry, <i>hermano</i>.

770
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,147
We'll get you back to where you belong.

771
01:02:53,232 --> 01:02:54,233
Hang tight.

772
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:19,049
Going somewhere?

773
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:21,885
We both are.

774
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:24,847
Pack what you need. Do it quietly.

775
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:29,059
Where exactly are we going?

776
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:33,856
It's real, Bren.
These kids are our ticket.

777
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:36,358
The Right Arm can't turn us away.

778
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,068
Go now.

779
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:54,376
Okay. I got it.

780
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:55,961
Minho, ready?

781
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:57,087
Yeah.

782
01:03:57,754 --> 01:04:01,508
Gotcha. Okay. One, two, here we go.

783
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:02,926
-Ready?
-Three.

784
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:08,557
Oh, shit.

785
01:04:26,325 --> 01:04:28,535
In position. Send them in.

786
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:40,964
Come on, Minho. Push her harder!

787
01:04:41,006 --> 01:04:42,007
Shit.

788
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:45,010
This is it.

789
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,178
One...

790
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,763
two... three!

791
01:04:49,807 --> 01:04:51,517
-Yes!
-Yes!

792
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:52,559
Okay.

793
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,353
Teresa, hurry!

794
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:15,958
So what,
you're just gonna give it all up?

795
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,209
Everything you've built?

796
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,002
There's no future here.

797
01:05:19,586 --> 01:05:21,964
What happens when another gang
finds this place?

798
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:24,758
And I lose control,
and I can't protect you.

799
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,010
I don't need you to protect me.

800
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:30,597
What happens if you get the Flare?

801
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:32,599
What am I supposed to do then?

802
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:34,643
Chain you up, watch you turn?

803
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:37,729
Put a bullet in your head?
Is that what you expect of me?

804
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:40,357
I would do the same thing for you.

805
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,406
<i>Good evening</i>!

806
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:50,159
<i>This is the
World Catastrophe Killzone Department</i>.

<i>Return them to us unharmed and we'll
consider this a simple misunderstanding</i>.

812
01:06:04,882 --> 01:06:05,591

813
01:06:06,467 --> 01:06:07,843
<i>Or you can resist..</i>.

814

Go get the kids.

820
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:26,987
What are you gonna do?

821
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:31,700
I'm gonna play 'em my favorite song.

822
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:34,328
Oh, shit.

823
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:37,039
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

824
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:45,005
We're not trying to cause any trouble, okay?
We just got to get out of here.

825
01:06:45,047 --> 01:06:46,590
Is that so?

826
01:06:46,632 --> 01:06:49,426
Janson, I got 'em for ya.
I'm bringing 'em down.

827
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:51,053
<i>Don't shoot us</i>.

828
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:54,056
Come on. Let's go.

829
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:56,475
I said let's go.

830
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:07,778
You little bastard!

831
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:17,287
Okay. Come on.

832
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:20,958
Come on! Let's go!

833
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,546
<i>Barkley, what's your location</i>?

834
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:27,297
<i>Barkley, are you there</i>?

835
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:06,503
Sir, you hearing this?

836
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:10,174
What is that?

837
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:13,302
Brenda! Hurry!

838
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:16,180
We don't have much time!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

839
01:08:16,847 --> 01:08:18,307
Right this way!

840
01:08:19,683 --> 01:08:21,477
You gotta be kidding me.

841
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:22,728
Plan B, <i>hermano</i>.

842
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,980
You kids wanna get to the Right Arm?

843
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:27,149
I'll lead you to them.
But you're gonna owe me.

844
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:34,156
Follow me!

845
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:37,242
All right! Let's go!

846
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:39,620
-Come on!
-Everyone, go.

847
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,205
Go! Come on.

848
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:43,540
-Come on!
-Aris, come on.

849
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:51,298
All units, push in!

850
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,175
<i>They're on the top floor!
Top floor</i>!

851
01:08:53,217 --> 01:08:54,510
We're on the move!

852
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:56,887
Go!

853
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:57,930
Go, Aris, go.

854
01:08:58,514 --> 01:08:59,890
Teresa, you're next. Come on.

855
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:02,059
Brenda! Where you going?

856
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,479
Just go. I'm right behind you.

857
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:06,563
Hurry.

858
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:10,901
Alpha 22 in pursuit.
We're on the move!

859
01:09:13,195 --> 01:09:14,738
Brenda, come on. What are you doing?

860
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:17,199
We gotta go!

861
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:18,408
-I got it.
-Come on.

862
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:21,036
Shit.

863
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:24,039
Take cover!

864
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:25,916
Go! Go!

865
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:32,047
Shit!

866
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:36,218
Come on, hurry!
We're running out of time!

867
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:41,723
-On the east!
-Cut 'em off!

868
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:44,726
I got eyes on!

869
01:09:45,102 --> 01:09:46,270
Here, follow me!

870
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:48,355
Come on!

871
01:09:48,939 --> 01:09:50,941
Stop! Stay right where you are!

872
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:58,157
Shit.

873
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:01,201
No, we need them.
You go around. I'll go after them.

874
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:04,538
Over here. Over here.

875
01:10:06,748 --> 01:10:07,833
Kid, don't move!

876
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,459
Brenda, where are we going?

877
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:12,045
Hurry! The song's almost over!

878
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:28,145
Holy shit!

879
01:10:30,814 --> 01:10:31,982
Come on.

880
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:40,741
Thomas! Come on!

881
01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:12,689
Are you okay?

882
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,400
Yeah, great.

883
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:22,741
No, no. How are we gonna
get back to the others?

884
01:11:23,784 --> 01:11:26,119
Relax. I'm gonna get us out of here.

885
01:11:27,204 --> 01:11:28,288
Here.

886
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:38,715
Why are you helping us?

887
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,718
Trust me, it's not my idea.

888
01:11:42,136 --> 01:11:44,930
Jorge seems to think you guys
are our ticket to the safe haven.

889
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:47,099
The what?

890
01:11:47,141 --> 01:11:49,560
You know, paradise.

891
01:11:50,227 --> 01:11:53,188
Safe from the sun,
free of infection.

892
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:57,317
Supposedly, the Right Arm's
been taking kids there for years.

893
01:11:58,318 --> 01:11:59,736
Immunes, anyway.

894
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:03,991
And you know where that is?

895
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:06,201
No.

896
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:09,788
But Jorge knows a guy.
Marcus.

897
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,585
He used to smuggle kids
up into the mountains.

898
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:21,258
If Jorge made it out,
that's where he'll be taking your friends.

899
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,676
If he made it out?

900
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:25,304
You ask a lot of questions.

901
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:29,975
Can you just come over here
and help me with this?

902
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:32,436
Please.

903
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:52,956
Well, that doesn't sound good.

904
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:55,709
Yeah.

905
01:12:56,919 --> 01:12:59,171
Down here they'll be full term.

906
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,509
Let's go.

907
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:28,909
I think it's this way.

908
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,578
You think?

909
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:41,088
Do people live down here?

910
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:43,924
The Solar Storms
forced people underground.

911
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,886
Jorge says there's settlements
all over these tunnels.

912
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:51,723
So, what about Jorge?
Is he your father?

913
01:13:51,765 --> 01:13:53,183
Close enough.

914
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,187
Truth is, I don't really know what he is.
He's just always been there.

915
01:13:58,355 --> 01:14:01,733
And I've always done what he's asked
me to do, no matter how stupid.

916
01:14:03,861 --> 01:14:06,155
So you don't think
the Right Arm is real?

917
01:14:12,035 --> 01:14:13,370
I think...

918
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:17,583
hope is a dangerous thing.

919
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:22,254
Hope has killed more of my friends
than the Flare and the Scorch combined.

920
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:26,758
Just thought Jorge was smarter than that.

921
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:37,394
Damn.

922
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:58,749
Hey, I think it might be this way.

923
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:01,752
Brenda?

924
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:06,256
Brenda?

925
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:09,259
I'm over here.
Look at this.

926
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:11,929
What? What is it?

927
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:35,327
What the hell is this?

928
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,789
I don't know.

929
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:03,105
Jesus.

930
01:16:46,023 --> 01:16:47,024
Go, go, go!

931
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:50,944
Oh, my God!

932
01:16:51,862 --> 01:16:52,988
Come on!

933
01:17:00,037 --> 01:17:01,163
Keep going!

934
01:17:02,498 --> 01:17:04,041
We're almost there. Come on.

935
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:21,058
Come on! This way!

936
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:32,069
Thomas! Come on!

937
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:41,662
Okay.

938
01:17:48,418 --> 01:17:50,170
-Go, go!
-Come on!

939
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:52,381
Keep going!

940
01:17:56,593 --> 01:17:57,594
Watch out!

941
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:12,276
Are you okay?

942
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,236
Come on!

943
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:17,739
Follow me!

944
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:19,783
Yeah, I'm behind you.

945
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:30,043
Go, go, go!

946
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:42,806
-Okay, go, go!
-Come on!

947
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:50,898
Brenda!

948
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:56,320
Brenda!

949
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:58,322
You okay?

950
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:00,657
Yeah.

951
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:06,121
Hang on, I'm gonna find a way down.

952
01:19:16,799 --> 01:19:18,801
No, Brenda, don't move.
Don't move!

953
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:34,233
-Come on.
-I can't.

954
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:36,026
Brenda, grab my hand.

955
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:38,904
No, no!

956
01:19:41,657 --> 01:19:42,658
Thomas!

957
01:19:45,244 --> 01:19:46,370
-Brenda!
-I can't reach!

958
01:19:53,877 --> 01:19:54,753
Come on!

959
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:57,673
Brenda!

960
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,478
Got you.

961
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:23,740
We can get down here. Come on.

962
01:20:32,291 --> 01:20:33,917
Hey, you hear that?

963
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:38,589
You all right?

964
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:46,346
Shit.

965
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:50,267
Brenda...

966
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:56,356
Yeah, yeah. I know.

967
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:03,030
Let's just go find Marcus.

968
01:21:17,336 --> 01:21:18,462
Okay.

969
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:20,339
Try to blend in.

970
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:00,838
Are you sure this is the place?

971
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:03,507
You here for the party?

972
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:07,010
No.

973
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:10,180
We're looking for Marcus.
This is his place, isn't it?

974
01:22:10,222 --> 01:22:12,391
This is my place.

975
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:19,231
Are you Marcus?

976
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:22,734
Marcus doesn't live here anymore.

977
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:25,195
Do you know where we can find him?

978
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:29,533
Sure, sure. He's over in Zone B.

979
01:22:30,868 --> 01:22:32,161
Okay. What's Zone B?

980
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:34,246
It's where they burn the bodies.

981
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:39,835
Okay, look, has anyone else been
by here...

982
01:22:39,877 --> 01:22:41,753
looking for him?

983
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:43,922
Group of kids around our age?
They had a girl with them.

984
01:22:43,964 --> 01:22:45,716
Dark hair.

985
01:22:45,757 --> 01:22:49,720
You know...
I think they might be inside.

986
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:51,763
Here.

987
01:22:54,892 --> 01:22:56,477
Drink this.

988
01:22:58,228 --> 01:22:59,730
What is it?

989
01:23:00,314 --> 01:23:02,483
The price of admission.

990
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:08,739
Drink it!

991
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:16,580
Your turn.

992
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:32,513
All right.

993
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:35,015
You two, enjoy the party.

994
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:54,284
Maybe we should split up.

995
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:57,162
See if we can find the others.

996
01:23:58,914 --> 01:23:59,873
Hey.

997
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,293
Don't drink anything else.

998
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:46,545
That was fun!

999
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:49,089
What?

1000
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:00,642
Brenda?

1001
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:03,562
They're not here.

1002
01:25:04,938 --> 01:25:09,485
Okay, well... we should keep looking.

1003
01:25:10,736 --> 01:25:11,904
Why?

1004
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:14,406
We couldn't find the Right Arm anyway.

1005
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,577
Not without Marcus.

1006
01:25:19,036 --> 01:25:21,246
Your friends are gone.

1007
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:23,916
It's over.

1008
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:25,834
It's just us now.

1009
01:25:28,212 --> 01:25:30,088
Just try and relax.

1010
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:32,674
Let go.

1011
01:25:33,967 --> 01:25:35,344
How?

1012
01:25:36,261 --> 01:25:37,763
Like this.

1013
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,452
What?

1014
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:04,498
You're not her.

1015
01:26:15,092 --> 01:26:16,176
Brenda.

1016
01:26:28,897 --> 01:26:30,023
Thomas.

1017
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:14,818
Hey.

1018
01:27:15,444 --> 01:27:17,029
Hey. Did anyone see you come here?

1019
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:18,447
No, what are you talking about?

1020
01:27:18,489 --> 01:27:19,823
We don't have a lot of time.

1021
01:27:19,865 --> 01:27:20,991
Thomas, what's wrong?

1022
01:27:21,033 --> 01:27:22,784
I just had to see you...

1023
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:24,620
and just try to explain things before...

1024
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:27,289
Oh, no.

1025
01:27:27,331 --> 01:27:28,332
Thomas!

1026
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:29,541
Just listen to me, okay?

1027
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:33,712
Whatever they tell you about me, whatever they say,
I just need you to know I had to do it.

1028
01:27:34,213 --> 01:27:35,297
Okay?

1029
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:37,299
What did you do?

1030
01:27:38,217 --> 01:27:40,719
I just couldn't keep watching them die.

1031
01:27:41,804 --> 01:27:42,846
Over here!

1032
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:43,931
Come on.

1033
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:44,807
No!

1034
01:27:44,848 --> 01:27:46,183
I'm sorry.

1035
01:27:46,558 --> 01:27:47,309
Thomas!

1036
01:27:48,435 --> 01:27:50,521
Hey, you're okay.

1037
01:27:51,939 --> 01:27:53,065
Hi.

1038
01:27:54,817 --> 01:27:57,110
We have to stop meeting like this.

1039
01:27:59,613 --> 01:28:01,365
Welcome back, you ugly shank.

1040
01:28:06,829 --> 01:28:10,791
I suggest that you talk!
You son of a bitch!

1041
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:12,668
Damn it!

1042
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:14,253
I'm sorry...

1043
01:28:14,294 --> 01:28:16,880
you're going to have to leave my house.

1044
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:19,758
Looks like you've been having fun.

1045
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:23,345
Listen. I don't enjoy hurting you.

1046
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:25,430
Okay?

1047
01:28:26,473 --> 01:28:28,475
Where is the Right Arm, Marcus?

1048
01:28:29,143 --> 01:28:30,727
Wait, this is Marcus?

1049
01:28:32,146 --> 01:28:34,106
The kid catches on quick.

1050
01:28:34,148 --> 01:28:36,692
Are you the brains
of the operation?

1051
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:38,861
I know you know where they're hiding.

1052
01:28:40,404 --> 01:28:44,700
So you tell me,
and I'll make you a deal.

1053
01:28:45,325 --> 01:28:47,494
You can come with us.

1054
01:28:47,536 --> 01:28:50,038
I burned that bridge a long time ago.

1055
01:28:50,664 --> 01:28:53,959
Besides, I made my own deal.

1056
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:59,214
You're the one who taught me,
never miss an opportunity.

1057
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:02,759
What's he talking about?

1058
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:07,723
I'm talking about supply and demand.

1059
01:29:08,265 --> 01:29:10,601
WICKED wants all the Immunes they can get.

1060
01:29:11,435 --> 01:29:12,978
I help provide that for them.

1061
01:29:13,937 --> 01:29:16,064
So I lure the kids in...

1062
01:29:16,106 --> 01:29:17,816
they get drunk, they have a good time.

1063
01:29:17,858 --> 01:29:21,111
And then, later, WICKED comes in...

1064
01:29:22,112 --> 01:29:25,365
they separate the wheat from the chaff.

1065
01:29:29,912 --> 01:29:31,455
I changed my mind, <i>hermano</i>.

1066
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:35,792
I do enjoy hurting you.

1067
01:29:41,006 --> 01:29:43,300
Talk! Talk!

1068
01:29:43,342 --> 01:29:44,968
Okay! Jesus!

1069
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:47,054
But I'm not making any promises.

1070
01:29:47,095 --> 01:29:49,348
These guys like to move around.

1071
01:29:55,354 --> 01:29:57,397
They have an outpost in the mountains.

1072
01:29:58,023 --> 01:29:59,733
But it's a long way away.

1073
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:03,195
You got half of WICKED on your ass.
You're never gonna make it.

1074
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:06,657
Not on foot.

1075
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,037
Where's Bertha?

1076
01:30:13,872 --> 01:30:15,541
Not Bertha.

1077
01:31:12,806 --> 01:31:15,809
Well, I guess we're on foot.

1078
01:31:54,097 --> 01:31:54,932
Get down!

1079
01:31:54,973 --> 01:31:55,849
Take cover!

1080
01:32:01,522 --> 01:32:03,690
Hey, is everyone okay out there?

1081
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:04,983
We're fine.

1082
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:07,236
Anyone know where
those bloody shots came from?

1083
01:32:07,611 --> 01:32:11,031
That son of a bitch, Marcus.
He led us into an ambush.

1084
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,586
What do we do?

1085
01:32:24,628 --> 01:32:25,921
Here.

1086
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:27,631
Hold this.

1087
01:32:27,673 --> 01:32:29,883
We gotta create a diversion.

1088
01:32:30,968 --> 01:32:32,469
You get ready to chuck it.

1089
01:32:35,305 --> 01:32:37,182
Everybody!

1090
01:32:37,224 --> 01:32:38,684
Get set to sprint back to the truck!

1091
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:40,310
And hold your ears!

1092
01:32:41,061 --> 01:32:42,896
Ready? One...

1093
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:45,190
Two...

1094
01:32:46,817 --> 01:32:47,818
Drop it.

1095
01:32:51,155 --> 01:32:52,322
Now!

1096
01:32:55,409 --> 01:32:56,326
I said drop it!

1097
01:33:01,165 --> 01:33:02,875
On your feet. Let's go.

1098
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:06,545
Let's go! Move!

1099
01:33:06,587 --> 01:33:08,255
-Back up!
-Easy.

1100
01:33:09,173 --> 01:33:10,299
You two, over here now!

1101
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:12,926
-Come on, let's go!
-Don't be stupid! Move.

1102
01:33:14,511 --> 01:33:15,846
Slowly.

1103
01:33:19,892 --> 01:33:20,851
Aris?

1104
01:33:24,271 --> 01:33:25,647
Oh, my God. Harriet?

1105
01:33:25,689 --> 01:33:27,900
My God.
What the hell are you doing here?

1106
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:32,821
Sonya.

1107
01:33:32,863 --> 01:33:35,115
Aris, you're lucky we didn't
shoot your dumb ass.

1108
01:33:35,866 --> 01:33:37,326
You all right, man?

1109
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:38,494
How...?

1110
01:33:38,535 --> 01:33:39,870
What's happening?

1111
01:33:40,287 --> 01:33:41,872
We were in the maze together.

1112
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:48,670
We're clear, guys! Come on out!

1113
01:33:48,712 --> 01:33:50,506
Copy that! We're clear!

1114
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:52,216
Stand down!

1115
01:33:58,388 --> 01:34:00,432
My God, you're alive.

1116
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:06,063
Back it up, Joe!

1117
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:07,397
Back it up!

1118
01:34:13,821 --> 01:34:15,697
We're taking them to base.

1119
01:34:15,739 --> 01:34:18,408
Wait, so, how did you guys get here?

1120
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:21,161
-The Right Arm got us out.
-Wait.

1121
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:25,415
The Right Arm?
Do you know where they are?

1122
01:34:27,918 --> 01:34:28,919
Hop in.

1123
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:11,211
They've been planning this
for over a year now.

1124
01:35:12,129 --> 01:35:13,797
This is all for us.

1125
01:35:13,839 --> 01:35:15,799
You guys are lucky you found us
when you did.

1126
01:35:15,841 --> 01:35:17,968
We're moving out at first light.

1127
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:18,969
Where's Vince?

1128
01:35:19,011 --> 01:35:20,471
Somewhere over there, I think.

1129
01:35:21,305 --> 01:35:22,681
Who's Vince?

1130
01:35:22,723 --> 01:35:26,351
He's the one who decides
if you get to stay.

1131
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:29,480
I thought the Right Arm
was supposed to be an army.

1132
01:35:29,521 --> 01:35:31,398
Yeah, we were.

1133
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:34,735
This is all that's left of us.

1134
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:41,658
Lot of good people died
getting us this far.

1135
01:35:43,577 --> 01:35:44,953
Who are they?

1136
01:35:44,995 --> 01:35:46,705
They're Immunes.

1137
01:35:46,747 --> 01:35:48,665
Caught 'em coming up the mountain.

1138
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,834
Did you check 'em?

1139
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:55,172
I know this guy, Aris. I trust him.

1140
01:35:56,089 --> 01:35:57,841
Well, I don't. Check 'em.

1141
01:35:59,426 --> 01:36:00,761
Hey, boss...

1142
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:04,181
Brenda! Brenda!

1143
01:36:04,723 --> 01:36:06,350
What's going on?

1144
01:36:07,518 --> 01:36:09,520
Brenda! Brenda.

1145
01:36:09,561 --> 01:36:12,981
-Brenda, talk to me.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1146
01:36:13,023 --> 01:36:14,316
What's going on with her?

1147
01:36:14,358 --> 01:36:16,652
I don't know.
Brenda, are you all right?

1148
01:36:16,693 --> 01:36:18,028
-Brenda? Talk to me.
-What the hell?

1149
01:36:19,947 --> 01:36:20,864
Shit!

1150
01:36:20,906 --> 01:36:22,241
-Crank! We got a Crank!
-No!

1151
01:36:22,282 --> 01:36:23,909
-No!
-Wait, wait!

1152
01:36:23,951 --> 01:36:25,661
-Step back!
-Listen, okay?

1153
01:36:25,702 --> 01:36:27,663
This just happened, okay?
She's not dangerous yet.

1154
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:28,997
You shouldn't have brought her here!

1155
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:29,873
I know.

1156
01:36:30,207 --> 01:36:32,251
We let Cranks in here now,
the safe haven doesn't last a week!

1157
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:34,211
-Step back!
-I understand, okay?

1158
01:36:34,253 --> 01:36:35,671
I understand.

1159
01:36:35,712 --> 01:36:37,005
Just listen. Please.

1160
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:39,216
Please, okay?
I told her that you could help.

1161
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:41,760
Okay? No.

1162
01:36:42,219 --> 01:36:43,971
There's got to be something you can do.

1163
01:36:46,723 --> 01:36:49,309
Yeah, there is.

1164
01:36:53,647 --> 01:36:55,274
-I can put her out of her misery.
-No!

1165
01:36:55,315 --> 01:36:56,233
No!

1166
01:36:56,275 --> 01:36:58,902
Vince, that's enough! Let him go.

1167
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:01,321
Let him go!

1168
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:06,076
She's infected, Doc.
There's nothing we can do for her.

1169
01:37:06,118 --> 01:37:08,579
No, but he can.

1170
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:12,791
Hello, Thomas.

1171
01:37:15,252 --> 01:37:16,295
What?

1172
01:37:18,255 --> 01:37:19,923
You know me?

1173
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,426
Interesting.

1174
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:26,638
It makes sense
they'd put you in the maze.

1175
01:37:27,764 --> 01:37:29,308
Though I must admit...

1176
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:32,478
I was worried they'd kill you
after what you did.

1177
01:37:34,438 --> 01:37:35,814
What I did?

1178
01:37:38,817 --> 01:37:42,613
The first time we spoke,
you said you couldn't take it anymore...

1179
01:37:43,197 --> 01:37:45,532
watching your friends die, one by one.

1180
01:37:47,117 --> 01:37:48,952
The last time we spoke...

1181
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:52,789
you gave me the coordinates
of every WICKED compound, trial and lab.

1182
01:37:55,209 --> 01:37:56,960
He was our source.

1183
01:37:58,462 --> 01:38:00,881
We couldn't have pulled
all this off without him.

1184
01:38:02,466 --> 01:38:03,842
Take her to the tent.

1185
01:38:04,468 --> 01:38:06,470
Get these guys some warm clothes.

1186
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:08,597
Careful.

1187
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,182
Come on.

1188
01:38:14,686 --> 01:38:17,189
Hey, it's the least we can do.

1189
01:38:17,856 --> 01:38:19,817
Thomas, come on.

1190
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:23,320
I need to get some blood from you.

1191
01:38:30,327 --> 01:38:32,913
In the beginning, we were lost.

1192
01:38:33,872 --> 01:38:36,291
All we knew for sure...

1193
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:39,711
was that the younger you were,
the stronger your chances.

1194
01:38:40,546 --> 01:38:42,214
You worked for WICKED?

1195
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:46,677
Long time ago.

1196
01:38:47,427 --> 01:38:49,680
You know, at first,
we had the best intentions.

1197
01:38:50,347 --> 01:38:52,683
Find a cure, save the world.

1198
01:38:54,017 --> 01:38:57,688
It was clear you kids were the key,
because you were immune.

1199
01:38:58,522 --> 01:38:59,857
But why?

1200
01:39:00,232 --> 01:39:02,276
Eventually, we found an answer.

1201
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:05,654
An enzyme produced
by the brains of the immune.

1202
01:39:05,696 --> 01:39:07,197
Once separated from the bloodstream...

1203
01:39:07,239 --> 01:39:10,701
it can serve as a powerful agent
to slow the spread of the virus.

1204
01:39:11,743 --> 01:39:13,912
So, you found a cure?

1205
01:39:14,454 --> 01:39:15,789
Not exactly.

1206
01:39:17,249 --> 01:39:21,587
The enzyme can't be manufactured,
only harvested from the immune.

1207
01:39:22,379 --> 01:39:23,589
The young.

1208
01:39:25,382 --> 01:39:27,843
Of course, that didn't stop WICKED.

1209
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:29,052
If they had their way...

1210
01:39:29,094 --> 01:39:32,097
they'd sacrifice an entire generation.

1211
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:34,808
All for this.

1212
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:37,352
A gift of biology.

1213
01:39:37,394 --> 01:39:39,104
Of evolution.

1214
01:39:40,898 --> 01:39:43,066
But one not meant for all of us.

1215
01:40:00,501 --> 01:40:02,252
How long will that give her?

1216
01:40:02,294 --> 01:40:04,838
It's different for everyone.
A few months maybe.

1217
01:40:06,256 --> 01:40:08,258
But that's the catch, isn't it?

1218
01:40:09,343 --> 01:40:10,844
She'll always need more.

1219
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:13,972
Okay.

1220
01:40:14,431 --> 01:40:17,059
Let's go outside. Let them rest.

1221
01:40:17,768 --> 01:40:18,769
Let's go.

1222
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:21,939
She'll be fine.

1223
01:40:31,114 --> 01:40:31,949
Thomas.

1224
01:40:33,575 --> 01:40:36,578
You know she can't come with us, right?

1225
01:41:34,344 --> 01:41:35,888
He was my brother.

1226
01:41:37,514 --> 01:41:39,683
Hey. Sorry.

1227
01:41:39,725 --> 01:41:41,727
Are you okay? How are you feeling?

1228
01:41:45,355 --> 01:41:47,483
You remind me of him.

1229
01:41:50,027 --> 01:41:52,696
He always saw the best in people.

1230
01:41:54,531 --> 01:41:56,074
Where is he now?

1231
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,250
I don't know.

1232
01:42:07,044 --> 01:42:09,296
When we were kids...

1233
01:42:09,338 --> 01:42:12,090
we were taken in
by one of WICKED's camps.

1234
01:42:15,427 --> 01:42:17,554
They gave us a bunch of tests.

1235
01:42:19,264 --> 01:42:21,058
They didn't want me.

1236
01:42:23,602 --> 01:42:25,229
They wanted him, though.

1237
01:42:31,068 --> 01:42:34,154
They didn't even let me say good-bye.

1238
01:42:40,828 --> 01:42:42,538
What was his name?

1239
01:42:46,542 --> 01:42:48,252
George.

1240
01:43:04,226 --> 01:43:05,561
That was Chuck.

1241
01:43:12,109 --> 01:43:14,361
How did he die?

1242
01:43:19,491 --> 01:43:21,118
Saving my life.

1243
01:43:35,632 --> 01:43:36,967
Get some rest.

1244
01:43:44,558 --> 01:43:46,143
<i>Hermano</i>.

1245
01:43:51,482 --> 01:43:53,442
If anything were to happen to her,
I...

1246
01:43:53,484 --> 01:43:55,486
I know, I know.

1247
01:43:55,944 --> 01:43:57,863
You should get in there. Go talk to her.

1248
01:44:02,367 --> 01:44:04,203
I guess I owe you, now.

1249
01:44:15,964 --> 01:44:19,051
So we broke out.
I'm telling the truth.

1250
01:44:29,686 --> 01:44:31,647
I wish Alby could've seen all this.

1251
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:35,984
And Winston.

1252
01:44:40,072 --> 01:44:41,281
And Chuck.

1253
01:44:43,867 --> 01:44:45,911
He'd be proud of you, you know, Tommy.

1254
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,247
Yeah.

1255
01:44:51,792 --> 01:44:53,210
Hey, Aris!

1256
01:44:54,211 --> 01:44:55,546
Hey, guys!

1257
01:44:56,755 --> 01:44:58,382
I kinda like that kid.

1258
01:44:59,591 --> 01:45:02,803
Yeah. I still don't trust him, though.

1259
01:45:09,393 --> 01:45:11,562
Hey, where's Teresa?

1260
01:45:11,603 --> 01:45:13,147
She went up there.

1261
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,541
Hey, you okay?

1262
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:34,751
What are you doing up here?

1263
01:45:36,462 --> 01:45:37,921
Just thinking.

1264
01:45:42,092 --> 01:45:43,719
All right, I'll let you be alone.

1265
01:45:47,347 --> 01:45:49,224
Do you remember your mother?

1266
01:45:57,524 --> 01:45:58,942
I think so.

1267
01:46:00,944 --> 01:46:02,571
I remember mine.

1268
01:46:05,115 --> 01:46:07,117
She was a beautiful woman.

1269
01:46:07,868 --> 01:46:09,620
Everybody loved her.

1270
01:46:11,205 --> 01:46:13,457
And before WICKED, she was all I had.

1271
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:22,674
When she got sick,
I didn't know what to do.

1272
01:46:24,468 --> 01:46:27,346
I just kept her locked up. Hidden.

1273
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,516
I thought she'd get better.

1274
01:46:32,976 --> 01:46:37,815
Every night, she'd make
these awful sounds, like screaming.

1275
01:46:38,857 --> 01:46:42,319
And then, one night, she just stopped.

1276
01:46:43,779 --> 01:46:45,322
She was finally quiet.

1277
01:46:48,242 --> 01:46:49,993
I went down to her room.

1278
01:46:52,788 --> 01:46:54,581
And there was blood everywhere.

1279
01:46:55,958 --> 01:46:58,126
But she was just sat there, calm.

1280
01:46:59,378 --> 01:47:00,838
She said she was feeling better.

1281
01:47:01,839 --> 01:47:04,466
The visions were gone.
She'd taken care of them.

1282
01:47:07,052 --> 01:47:09,888
She took her eyes out, Thomas.

1283
01:47:12,808 --> 01:47:16,478
There are millions of people
suffering out there.

1284
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,981
Millions of stories, just like mine.

1285
01:47:22,776 --> 01:47:25,154
We can't turn our backs on them.

1286
01:47:26,488 --> 01:47:27,906
I won't.

1287
01:47:32,161 --> 01:47:33,579
What are you saying?

1288
01:47:35,038 --> 01:47:37,666
I'm saying, I want you to understand.

1289
01:47:39,418 --> 01:47:41,044
Understand what?

1290
01:47:42,963 --> 01:47:44,298
Why I did it.

1291
01:47:55,934 --> 01:47:57,144
Teresa...

1292
01:47:57,811 --> 01:47:59,980
Please don't fight them, Thomas.

1293
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,774
What have you done?

1294
01:48:05,194 --> 01:48:06,945
What have you done?

1295
01:48:26,423 --> 01:48:28,300
No!

1296
01:48:48,821 --> 01:48:51,490
All right, drop in, boys. Round 'em up.

1297
01:49:07,714 --> 01:49:09,049
Go, go!

1298
01:49:11,301 --> 01:49:12,302
Take 'em out!

1299
01:49:16,223 --> 01:49:17,432
Tyson!

1300
01:49:19,393 --> 01:49:21,103
-Stop!
-Don't move!

1301
01:49:22,688 --> 01:49:24,022
Where's Thomas?

1302
01:49:25,524 --> 01:49:27,651
Harriet! Ammo!

1303
01:49:29,194 --> 01:49:30,612
Vince! Harriet!

1304
01:49:30,654 --> 01:49:32,197
-Come on!
-Over here!

1305
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:33,240
How can we help?

1306
01:49:33,282 --> 01:49:35,075
You need to cover us!

1307
01:49:35,951 --> 01:49:37,286
Ammo!

1308
01:49:37,703 --> 01:49:40,164
Hey! Do you know how to use this thing?

1309
01:49:40,205 --> 01:49:41,206
Cover me!

1310
01:49:41,456 --> 01:49:43,167
This fifty's our only chance!

1311
01:49:54,219 --> 01:49:55,220
Brenda!

1312
01:50:01,768 --> 01:50:03,103
You dumbass.

1313
01:50:03,145 --> 01:50:03,896
Come on!

1314
01:50:04,646 --> 01:50:06,773
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1315
01:50:08,108 --> 01:50:10,402
We gotta take cover!

1316
01:50:10,444 --> 01:50:12,863
We have to go.
Now, while we still have the chance.

1317
01:50:12,905 --> 01:50:14,031
I gotta go find the others.

1318
01:50:14,072 --> 01:50:16,825
No! Look! Look.

1319
01:50:16,867 --> 01:50:18,785
You can't help them.

1320
01:50:23,373 --> 01:50:25,250
Vince, hurry up!
There's too many of them.

1321
01:50:31,089 --> 01:50:31,882
I'm out!

1322
01:50:35,052 --> 01:50:36,553
Look out!

1323
01:50:36,887 --> 01:50:37,638
Shit!

1324
01:50:45,229 --> 01:50:47,731
All right, take me down.

1325
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:53,403
Shit. Shit.

1326
01:50:55,739 --> 01:50:57,241
I'm sorry.

1327
01:50:57,908 --> 01:50:59,535
There's just nothing
you can do for them.

1328
01:50:59,576 --> 01:51:03,622
If we don't move now,
we won't be much better off.

1329
01:51:06,834 --> 01:51:08,544
You guys gotta go right now.

1330
01:51:08,585 --> 01:51:09,545
What?

1331
01:51:09,586 --> 01:51:12,172
They're not looking for you.
You'll be safe, but you have to go now.

1332
01:51:12,798 --> 01:51:13,924
Thomas...

1333
01:51:18,762 --> 01:51:20,472
I can't leave without them.

1334
01:51:23,142 --> 01:51:24,268
Go.

1335
01:51:26,186 --> 01:51:27,604
Good luck, kid.

1336
01:51:28,605 --> 01:51:31,984
Bren, we have to go. Come on. Come on.

1337
01:51:32,609 --> 01:51:34,361
Let's go, come on. Come on!

1338
01:52:01,263 --> 01:52:02,139
Let's go, let's go!

1339
01:52:08,103 --> 01:52:10,063
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1340
01:52:14,109 --> 01:52:17,905
Line them up right here! On their knees!
Put some eyes up on that ridge.

1341
01:52:19,823 --> 01:52:20,908
B-4.

1342
01:52:22,326 --> 01:52:23,619
How many did we get?

1343
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:25,370
All of them. Give or take.

1344
01:52:25,412 --> 01:52:26,580
Give or take what?

1345
01:52:26,622 --> 01:52:28,165
Well, they lost a few.

1346
01:52:30,834 --> 01:52:32,169
A-4.

1347
01:52:35,172 --> 01:52:36,173
A-6.

1348
01:52:41,178 --> 01:52:42,179
B-3.

1349
01:52:43,013 --> 01:52:44,890
Where's Thomas?

1350
01:52:44,932 --> 01:52:46,642
Right here.

1351
01:52:47,476 --> 01:52:48,685
Freeze!

1352
01:52:50,521 --> 01:52:51,146
Go!

1353
01:52:57,486 --> 01:52:58,654
Thomas.

1354
01:53:01,532 --> 01:53:02,950
Get him in line.

1355
01:53:10,332 --> 01:53:11,375
Okay.

1356
01:53:14,128 --> 01:53:15,379
Bring her in.

1357
01:53:19,133 --> 01:53:20,717
Why didn't you run?

1358
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,390
I'm tired of running.

1359
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:26,366
Is this all of them?

1360
01:54:26,408 --> 01:54:27,868
Most of them.

1361
01:54:28,744 --> 01:54:29,786
It'll be enough.

1362
01:54:30,287 --> 01:54:31,497
Start loading them in.

1363
01:54:31,538 --> 01:54:32,831
Yes, ma'am.

1364
01:54:32,873 --> 01:54:34,249
Okay, you heard. Let's go!

1365
01:54:34,291 --> 01:54:35,375
Get 'em on!

1366
01:54:45,135 --> 01:54:46,804
Hello, Thomas.

1367
01:54:54,311 --> 01:54:56,271
I'm glad you're safe.

1368
01:54:57,105 --> 01:54:58,232
What the hell?

1369
01:54:58,816 --> 01:54:59,817
Teresa?

1370
01:55:00,108 --> 01:55:01,777
Wait, what's going on?

1371
01:55:02,486 --> 01:55:03,570
She's with them.

1372
01:55:05,656 --> 01:55:06,824
Since when?

1373
01:55:08,242 --> 01:55:11,370
Teresa's always had an evolved
appreciation of the greater good.

1374
01:55:11,411 --> 01:55:16,166
Once we restored her memories,
it was only a matter of time.

1375
01:55:20,129 --> 01:55:21,255
Let's go, let's go.

1376
01:55:21,296 --> 01:55:22,589
I'm sorry.

1377
01:55:23,799 --> 01:55:27,094
I had no choice. This is the only way.

1378
01:55:27,136 --> 01:55:29,555
We have to find a cure.

1379
01:55:29,596 --> 01:55:32,975
She's right.
This is all just a means to an end.

1380
01:55:33,016 --> 01:55:34,977
You used to understand that, Thomas.

1381
01:55:35,519 --> 01:55:37,437
No matter what you think of me...

1382
01:55:37,479 --> 01:55:39,565
I am not a monster. I'm a doctor.

1383
01:55:39,606 --> 01:55:42,192
I swore an oath to find a cure!

1384
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:44,027
No matter the cost.

1385
01:55:47,865 --> 01:55:50,033
I just need more time.

1386
01:55:50,868 --> 01:55:52,494
More blood.

1387
01:55:55,831 --> 01:55:57,374
Hello, Mary.

1388
01:55:57,833 --> 01:56:00,002
I hoped we'd meet again.

1389
01:56:00,043 --> 01:56:02,045
I'm sorry it had to be
under these circumstances.

1390
01:56:02,671 --> 01:56:06,884
I'm sorry about a lot of things, too.
But not this.

1391
01:56:08,343 --> 01:56:10,637
At least my conscience is clear.

1392
01:56:12,723 --> 01:56:14,391
So is mine.

1393
01:56:18,562 --> 01:56:20,481
Mary? Mary?

1394
01:56:20,856 --> 01:56:21,565
Mary!

1395
01:56:23,525 --> 01:56:25,903
Mary! Mary!

1396
01:56:26,904 --> 01:56:28,238
Get off me!

1397
01:56:28,864 --> 01:56:30,657
Mary? Mary?

1398
01:56:30,699 --> 01:56:31,408
Mary?

1399
01:56:33,368 --> 01:56:34,495
Mary?

1400
01:56:35,662 --> 01:56:36,747
No!

1401
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,334
Mary! No!

1402
01:56:41,376 --> 01:56:42,711
Come on, Janson.

1403
01:56:42,753 --> 01:56:44,671
Load them up. Let's go.

1404
01:56:44,713 --> 01:56:47,299
All these people. Get rid of them.

1405
01:56:47,341 --> 01:56:48,759
Let's go. Let's go!

1406
01:56:49,259 --> 01:56:50,010
Let go of me!

1407
01:56:50,052 --> 01:56:51,053
Sonya! Aris!

1408
01:56:53,514 --> 01:56:54,389
Get back!

1409
01:56:54,431 --> 01:56:55,599
Everyone, stand back!

1410
01:56:56,183 --> 01:56:58,143
-Stand back!
-Hold your fire!

1411
01:56:58,185 --> 01:56:59,520
-Everyone, stand back!
-Hold your fire!

1412
01:56:59,853 --> 01:57:02,481
-Stand back. Let 'em go.
-Thomas, put it down.

1413
01:57:02,523 --> 01:57:04,775
-Let 'em all go!
-You know I can't do that!

1414
01:57:04,817 --> 01:57:06,276
Thomas, please stop.

1415
01:57:06,527 --> 01:57:10,072
I made a deal with them.
They promised we'd be safe. All of us.

1416
01:57:10,113 --> 01:57:11,657
And I'm supposed to trust you now?

1417
01:57:11,698 --> 01:57:13,909
It's true. It was her only condition.

1418
01:57:13,951 --> 01:57:15,035
Shut up!

1419
01:57:15,285 --> 01:57:17,454
Everything can go back
to the way it was.

1420
01:57:18,372 --> 01:57:19,373
Thomas...

1421
01:57:20,290 --> 01:57:21,834
do you really want
all of them to die?

1422
01:57:23,293 --> 01:57:26,004
Listen to her, Thomas.
Think about what you're doing.

1423
01:57:35,681 --> 01:57:37,724
We're with you, Thomas.

1424
01:57:38,517 --> 01:57:39,810
No.

1425
01:57:40,352 --> 01:57:41,520
Don't.

1426
01:57:42,104 --> 01:57:43,647
-Do it, Thomas.
-We're ready.

1427
01:57:45,566 --> 01:57:46,567
We're not going back there.

1428
01:57:47,192 --> 01:57:48,360
Thomas?

1429
01:57:49,111 --> 01:57:50,821
It's the only way.

1430
01:57:53,031 --> 01:57:53,991
Thomas!

1431
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:18,056
-Come on. Come on!
-Get her out of here!

1432
01:58:19,516 --> 01:58:20,142
You good?

1433
01:58:20,684 --> 01:58:22,561
Freeze! Drop it, kid!

1434
01:58:24,563 --> 01:58:26,190
Run! Get down!

1435
01:58:36,408 --> 01:58:37,534
Freeze!

1436
01:58:46,877 --> 01:58:48,003
What a waste.

1437
01:59:03,811 --> 01:59:05,896
Vince, go!

1438
01:59:07,064 --> 01:59:08,315
Now!

1439
01:59:21,411 --> 01:59:22,746
Keep going. I got you.

1440
01:59:30,671 --> 01:59:32,881
Get outta here! Go! Go!

1441
01:59:34,424 --> 01:59:35,968
Come on, Thomas! Get outta here!

1442
01:59:36,009 --> 01:59:37,136
Minho, let's go!

1443
01:59:37,177 --> 01:59:38,345
Get out of here! Go!

1444
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:40,931
Get down!

1445
01:59:47,437 --> 01:59:48,272
Minho!

1446
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:53,902
Minho!

1447
01:59:53,944 --> 01:59:54,945
Come back!

1448
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:00,909
-Thomas, get back!
-No! Thomas, no!

1449
02:00:01,243 --> 02:00:01,952
Minho!

1450
02:00:03,912 --> 02:00:04,621
Thomas!

1451
02:00:07,666 --> 02:00:08,792
Minho!

1452
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:11,003
Go! Come on!

1453
02:00:11,044 --> 02:00:12,129
Minho!

1454
02:00:12,171 --> 02:00:13,255
Minho!

1455
02:01:35,754 --> 02:01:37,548
What do we do now?

1456
02:01:40,717 --> 02:01:43,095
Well, we pick up what's left of us.

1457
02:01:44,429 --> 02:01:45,556
We stick to the plan.

1458
02:01:45,597 --> 02:01:47,766
We get you kids to the safe haven.

1459
02:01:56,441 --> 02:01:58,861
Then we start over, I guess.

1460
02:02:06,702 --> 02:02:08,453
I'm not going with you.

1461
02:02:11,331 --> 02:02:12,499
What?

1462
02:02:14,084 --> 02:02:16,336
I made a promise to Minho.

1463
02:02:16,962 --> 02:02:19,006
I wouldn't leave him behind.
I have to go after him.

1464
02:02:21,717 --> 02:02:23,510
Hey, kid, look around you.

1465
02:02:23,552 --> 02:02:26,054
All right?
WICKED just kicked our ass.

1466
02:02:28,307 --> 02:02:30,642
You think about where you're headed.

1467
02:02:31,185 --> 02:02:33,812
I'm not asking anyone to come with me.

1468
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:36,482
Thomas, listen to me.

1469
02:02:37,316 --> 02:02:42,571
I've known Minho for...
Well, as long as I can remember.

1470
02:02:44,114 --> 02:02:46,742
So, if there was any way
that we could help him...

1471
02:02:46,783 --> 02:02:49,578
trust me,
I would be up there standing next to you.

1472
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:51,830
This, what you're talking about...

1473
02:02:52,623 --> 02:02:54,291
is impossible.

1474
02:02:55,959 --> 02:02:57,961
More like suicide.

1475
02:03:01,006 --> 02:03:02,132
Maybe.

1476
02:03:03,467 --> 02:03:05,719
But I know what I'm supposed to do now.

1477
02:03:08,222 --> 02:03:12,267
It's not just about Minho.
It's about all of us.

1478
02:03:12,309 --> 02:03:15,729
It's about everyone WICKED's ever taken,
everyone they will take.

1479
02:03:17,648 --> 02:03:19,066
They'll never stop.

1480
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:25,489
They'll never stop,
so I'm gonna stop them.

1481
02:03:28,992 --> 02:03:31,703
I'm gonna kill Ava Paige.

1482
02:03:35,666 --> 02:03:37,167
I have to admit...

1483
02:03:39,336 --> 02:03:41,421
I'd like some revenge.

1484
02:03:46,677 --> 02:03:48,929
Well, that's a good speech, kid.

1485
02:03:50,722 --> 02:03:52,391
So, what's your plan?
