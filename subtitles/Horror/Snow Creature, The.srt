1
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,708
It all began so nice.

2
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:51,292
A bunch of friends at a cabin 
in the mountains. 

3
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,792
Lots of alcohol, laughter.
We had fun.

4
00:00:55,958 --> 00:01:00,375
And then don't you fucking know it,
a squad of nazi zombies woke up.

5
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:07,542
I know.
It sounds like a cliché, 

6
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,333
but that's what happened.

7
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:15,042
You see, we found something.

8
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,875
Something we shouldn't have found.

9
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:24,000
Old Nazi gold.

10
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:27,208
And then ... 

11
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,500
All hell broke loose.

12
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,375
They slaughtered us.
One .....

13
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,833
.... by one.
One of them bit me.

14
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:58,250
But I knew how I could fix it.

15
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,292
My girlfriend Hanna .... 

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,500
They .... 

17
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,542
They got her too.

18
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,500
I got the gold.

19
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,792
Gave it back.

20
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:32,083
And they let me go.

21
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,625
I thought I was safe.

22
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:07,208
I was wrong.

23
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,167
Take the damn coin and go back 
to hell where you came from!

24
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,167
Shit, shit, shit.

25
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,958
Okay, okay.

27
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:21,500
I knew we should not
have touched the box.

28
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,875
Stay awake now.
Stay awake.

29
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,667
That's a good question, Toralf.
Of all migratory birds

30
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:47,542
there's a little critter
that really stands out.

31
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,458
Namely, Arctic Terns,
or Sterna Paradisaea,

32
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,208
a coastal bound,
surface-feeding seabird 

33
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,000
from the group "Havterner".

34
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:04,292
Havternen maneuvers gracefully
in the air like a .... 

35
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:23,333
Troops, Sieg Heil!

37
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,667
Yes?

38
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:38,667
What do we have here?

39
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:41,125
Martin, can you hear me?

40
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:45,167
Hello, Martin.
Welcome back.

41
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,500
Martin, you crashed your car.

42
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,667
A nasty crash.
You are lucky to be alive.

43
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,250
That is more than one can say
about your friends.

44
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,917
Have you seen ....

45
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,750
Have you seen the creatures?

46
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,875
The things.....

47
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:16,042
Have the police caught them?
Or the army?

48
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,083
Roy and Erlend?

49
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,958
- Hanna?
- We found our friends. All of them.

50
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,125
Dead.
Hanna was your girlfriend, right?

51
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,708
Very beautiful.
We found her too.

52
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,167
With an ax driven into the neck.

53
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,917
And your fingerprints on the shaft.

54
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,875
Do you have any idea
how that could happen?

55
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,708
They came up from ....

56
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:52,583
From the snow. Creatures. Nazis.
We got away, but ....

57
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,250
Nazis coming out of the ground?
Absurd.

58
00:09:56,417 --> 00:10:01,042
Are you sure that he doesn't 
have brain damage as well?

59
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:07,083
Please call the family and tell them that he 
has awakened, and ask the D.A. to send a car.

60
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,542
And four additional men. It looks like 
you are ready to be transported.

61
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:15,208
They are still out there. They will kill
again if we do not stop them.

62
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:19,708
We are not going to stop anyone.
I've seen what you've done.

63
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:25,125
I was up there, and the only place you are going 
is to jail. No one knows what happened up there.

64
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,167
Only you know that.
And it's not only bad news.

65
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:34,833
When we found you, you were badly injured.
Your right arm was torn straight off.

66
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,167
- It was not torn ....
- When we found you, it was cold.

67
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:42,750
The snow had chilled all,
and that was very good.

68
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:46,917
- And then we found your arm in the car.
- In the car?

69
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:51,792
It was slightly bruised and quite 
pale for some strange reason,

70
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,333
but the surgery was a success.

71
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,542
We managed to re-attach your arm.

72
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,875
No, no, no.

73
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,875
- It's not my arm.
- Relax.

74
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:24,917
It is Satan's arm!
It is Satan's arm!

75
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,500
Calm down.

76
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,667
No, it's not me!

77
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,250
No!

78
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,625
It's not me!
What the hell ...?

79
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,292
Stop!

80
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,375
Randi?

81
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:58,375
Be prepared to remove your 
dentures a bit later ...

82
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:01,667
I'm ready for a little head tonight.

83
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:41,208
From the one that got away.

84
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:44,458
Nameless German Soldiers 
Who Fell In World War II

85
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,792
Broken.

86
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,750
Warm.

87
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:45,208
The men have rotted.

88
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,875
We need more people.

89
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,000
Damn lock!

90
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,125
You scared me, Nils.

91
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,167
I can't take any more of your nonsense.
I've had a hell of a long day.

92
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:34,292
A wedding, a funeral
and a confirmation.

93
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:38,125
The one confirmant was damn fine.

94
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,833
If only I had been ten years younger ...

95
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,042
And not a priest, of course.

96
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,208
Nils?

97
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,250
Come on!

98
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,292
Sieg ....

99
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,625
Heil.

100
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:46,917
Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil.

101
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,667
They came down from the mountain.

102
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,625
I saw them.

103
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,417
Hey! Hey!

104
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,375
They are coming!
They're going to kill everyone!

105
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,583
Psst, hey.
Hey, you, psst. Yeah, you.

106
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,542
Hello.

107
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,792
I saw your arm.
Looks really cool.

108
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:58,542
Took some pictures too.
Looks sick, but still cool.

109
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:04,625
I am not supposed to be in here,
but I snuck in here like a ninja.

110
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,125
Oh, I am Bobby.
I am here on vacation with my mom.

111
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:14,292
She ate some bad fish yesterday,
so ... yeah ..

112
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,542
Cool.
Seriously cool.

113
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,000
It looks burned.
And old.

114
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:25,708
Like a zombie arm.
Zombies are cool.

115
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,625
Zombies?

116
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:33,417
Oh, sorry, got to take this. They are 
wondering if I can get some more info.

117
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,667
More than just a picture of the arm.

118
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,083
Who? What?

119
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,000
The Zombie Squad. They are wondering 
if I can get some more info.

120
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,667
They are experts on zombies.
They live in America.

121
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:48,250
They have trained for this for years, 
just waiting for a zombie outbreak to happen.

122
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:52,667
So they can come here? Just tell them 
to come right now to get the zombies.

123
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,000
If they are experts they can kill 
the zombies for us!

124
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,833
I know. You've seen the zombies? 
'Cause they're real, right? Yeah!

125
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,667
- Can you let me loose?
- I'm not sure if I should, I mean, you're ..

126
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,792
- I have chocolate.
- You do?

127
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:15,208
Yeah, I have chocolate. 'Cause I could 
get it for you, but you know ...

128
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:19,042
- Double-triple-fudge.
- Oh my God ...!

129
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,333
Let me get this right here.

130
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,500
Come on.
You can do it.

131
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,625
Help me with the other.

132
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,208
- Can I have my chocolate now?
- There is no chocolate, kid.

133
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:44,333
- No chocolate?
- Shut the fuck up.

134
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,000
I got to get out.

135
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,958
Hey!

136
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:06,458
It's not what it looks like.

137
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,625
Stop!

139
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,833
Hello?

140
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,417
This is Daniel Heffernan, leader of the 
Zombie Squad. Can I please speak to Bobby?

141
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,667
Bobby, uhh ...

142
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:18,083
- Bobby, he ... 
- I don't speak the language of Thor.

143
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,625
- Is Bobby there?
- Bobby was killed by zombies.

144
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:23,500
My God.

145
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:29,250
Is this Zombie Squad? That is a 10.4, Martin, 
and we will be heading your way shortly.

146
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:34,542
But before we go we need as much information 
as you can give us. Anything you have.

147
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,750
Well, umm .....

148
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,208
We came up to the cabin,
and there was a bunch of ... of ..

149
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,208
Nazi zombies there and ...

150
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:50,333
You know, they killed us all, and .. 

151
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,333
Except me. Yeah, and ...

152
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,125
I had to saw my arm off and that, but ..

153
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:00,167
It's ... yeah, the arm is ... and ..

154
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,375
But then they wanted the 
treasure and the coin and ...

155
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:06,333
- Were any of you bitten?
- We were all bitten,

156
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,125
But we didn't become one of them.
We just ....

157
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:16,042
We just died, so ...

158
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:21,000
Listen, Martin, and listen good.

159
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,792
These are not your classic 
textbook zombies,

160
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:29,500
just hungering to feast on the flesh of man. 
No, these are most likely cursed zombies.

161
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:32,583
Awakened to reclaim something that 
was stolen from them,

162
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,417
- or to complete a task given to them.
- They called him Herzog, they ... 

163
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,917
They called him Herzog.

164
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,583
Martin of the North, 
we will be on our way shortly,

165
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,792
and we will take care of
this infection.

166
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:52,125
We are professionals.
But until then,

167
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:57,042
find out what they seek, 
their purpose. Bye.

168
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,417
Zombie Squad, they are ....

169
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:09,000
They are professionals.

170
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:13,708
They are bad ass.

171
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,875
Okay, girls.

172
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,125
It looks like we're going to Norway.

173
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:28,833
Norway? We can't go to Norway.
That's on the other side of the world.

174
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,917
Yeah, and how do we know it's for real? I mean, Daniel, 
that is a long way to go to find out if it's a hoax?

175
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,958
You saw the picture.

176
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,292
This is a bonafide infected arm.
You know this. 

177
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:44,583
All the signs are there, guys. The decayed 
skin, the rotten hair, the dark blood.

178
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,500
- This is real, guys, it's real.
- This could be dangerous.

179
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:51,917
No shit, it's fucking zombies.
Of course it will be dangerous!

180
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:57,417
But this is what we've been waiting for. This is our 
chance  to prove to everyone that we were right.

181
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:02,625
I mean, we've been telling everyone for 
years that it is just a matter of time

182
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:06,958
before the first outbreak happens.
And what have we seen in return?

183
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,125
Laughter. Ridicule.

184
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,458
Wedgies.

185
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,917
Well, guess who was right?

186
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:23,792
- Guess who's laughing now?
- I guess we're laughing now?

187
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:28,625
You're damn right we are. I mean, what did we start 
the Zombie Squad for if it wasn't for this?

188
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,875
- He's right.
- Damn right I'm right.

189
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:36,375
And besides, if we don't do this...
If we don't go there and help these people...

190
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,917
Who the hell will?
Yeah ....

191
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,625
- So what do we do?
- Yes!

192
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:48,667
Okay, we need as much information as we 
can get on this Herzog character,

193
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,500
on Martin and north of Norway, everything.

194
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:55,167
Oh wait, hold on, guys.
We can't let our landlords know about this.

195
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:58,292
- Do you mean our parents?
- Yes, our parents, but ...

196
00:27:58,458 --> 00:28:01,708
- We just can't tell them what's happening.
- Got it.

197
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:05,042
Alright, official members of the 
Zombie Squad USA....

198
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,500
- Oh my God ...!
- It's time to go hunting.

199
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,333
That was further than usual.

200
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:49,208
I poured you some coffee.

201
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:54,792
- Damn, it is cold.
- It's because you're 40 minutes late.

202
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:59,167
I am on winter time.
That winter time, summer time system ..

203
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:03,708
It's so stupid.
What do you have?

204
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,417
Not much. Petra's boy has been
shoplifting again.

205
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:12,292
They should have done what they do in Iran.
Cut off his hands. Taught him a lesson.

206
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:16,000
And Ove's dog has pooped 
in Mr. Olsen's garden.

207
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,917
- Shoot him.
- Shoot Mr. Olsen?

208
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,833
Not shoot Mr. Olsen. 
You shoot the dog!

209
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,625
In addition we have a lecture in school
about the danger of using marijuana.

210
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,250
Boring ....

211
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:32,083
There was one thing, though.
From Oksfjord.

212
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:36,000
Oksfjord? No, no, no, it is 
not our jurisdiction.

213
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:40,708
Martin Hykkerud escaped from the 
hospital yesterday.

214
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:45,625
Martin Hykkerud? The same Martin Hykkerud who 
killed his friends on top of the mountain?

215
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah. He escaped from the hospital yesterday 
and killed a little boy and a policeman ...

216
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:54,875
by throwing a Mercedes star at his face.

217
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:57,750
- He cut off the Mercedes star?
- Yeah.

218
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:01,833
- What does Oslo say?
- About the Mercedes star?

219
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,167
About the Hykkerud case!

220
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:08,542
They say we all need to be on alert, 
and that we need to get more people.

221
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:11,250
Hold the fort until they can send a team.

222
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:14,917
Send a team, more people ... Where the hell 
do I find the money to bring in more people?

223
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:19,708
I don't even have money to buy new 
batteries for the cars out here.

224
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,708
Okay. Right.

225
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,458
What?

226
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:30,917
Didn't we agree on a more 
casual style here?

227
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,708
Continue.

228
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:48,833
My God, I was expecting something like the 
Hoth system, but this is more like Endor.

229
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,958
Can't you reference anything 
other than Star Wars?

230
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:57,417
- Like Star Trek maybe if I can't sleep.
- Yeah, at least it is based on scientific theories ...

231
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:00,333
- Guys, guys, I have a lock on Martin.
- Where is he?

232
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,042
- Ice Bay.
- Ok, let's go!

233
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:07,542
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
First there is something we need to do.

234
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:11,167
- Oh yeah, I really have to pee.
- No!

235
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:15,458
Arm up!
You really fucking ruined that.

236
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:14,042
It would be a lot easier if  we 
could buy  weapons here. I know.

237
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,208
What the fuck's the matter with
this country?

239
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:07,125
Can I help you?

240
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:10,500
Too much coffee. 
You just go ahead. 

241
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:13,417
Best for you if you move on.

242
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:33,583
This is a war museum, huh?

243
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,917
Yes.

244
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,792
Yes, and ....

245
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:42,667
Do you have any information
about the Germans?

246
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:51,417
Help!

247
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,833
Listen to me!

248
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:02,083
I don't have time for this now. They're coming, 
and we must stop them! Do you understand.

249
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,875
I have two kittens at home. 
Please  don't hurt me. Shut up!

250
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,833
Just help me.
Please.

251
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,958
- Do you have information about Einsatz?
- Yes.

252
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:18,542
- First floor.
- First floor.

253
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:32,042
Where the hell are you?

254
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,542
- What are you looking for?
- Herzog.

255
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:47,458
Hitler's buddy.

256
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:51,875
- Nice, huh?
- Do not touch the exhibit.

257
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,042
Herzog was made commander of 
Einsatz in 1942,

258
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:01,167
and was sent to the far north of Norway,
in order to protect the warships

259
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,875
that the German Navy was hiding 
in the fjords.

260
00:36:05,042 --> 00:36:12,000
He was on duty in Oksfjord doing a routine 
inspection on the ship Scharnholst, when ...

261
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,750
Scharnholst.

262
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:21,167
When Tirpitz, the German
fleet's biggest warship 

263
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:25,083
was attacked by English bombers in Talvik,

264
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:30,417
after getting vital information on the 
ships location from Norwegian spies.

265
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:34,458
Hitler, humiliated by the attack on 
Tirpitz ordered Herzog

266
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:40,625
to wipe out all of the 800 men, and people 
who lived in Talvik at the time.

267
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:46,417
He was on his way?

268
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:52,792
He was on his way to Talvik the evening him 
and his men were slaughtered in Oksfjord?

269
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:55,875
On a mission from Hitler.

270
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:05,750
A mission that was never completed. 
That is what it is. That's exactly what it is.

271
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,917
They will destroy Talvik.

272
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,667
Where .....?

273
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:22,083
Herzog was going from Oksfjord,

274
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,458
which is here.

275
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:27,667
And he was going to Talvik.

276
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:30,208
It's here.

277
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,250
Where are we now?

278
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,917
Where are we now?!

279
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,875
Here.

280
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:41,833
Ice Bay.

281
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:49,250
It is right between ....

283
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:36,208
They are recruiting!

284
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:41,500
They make new soldiers.
Can they do that now? Fuck!

285
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,750
Okay, they're coming here.
They're coming here.

286
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:49,625
I will not die in a museum with 
a guy in a green jogging suit.

287
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:52,417
Calm down.
You will die.

288
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,458
But relax.
Not today.

289
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:50,208
There!

290
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,917
Let's see what this thing can do.

291
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,917
What kind of thing?

292
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,792
What did you do?
You just killed them without ...

293
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:30,750
It's the arm, man.

294
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:35,750
Before I could not control it,
but now it does what I think.

295
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:38,417
You're not even sweating.

296
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,167
Don't worry about it.

297
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:50,917
They will increase in numbers.
Damn, they will be many.

298
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:54,000
There are too many for this arm.

299
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,250
So much death.

300
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:27,417
All this unnecessary death.

302
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,083
Fuck!

303
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,083
You did what the fucker
did before. You just ...

304
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,500
- You ...
- No, it was the arm. It was the arm.

305
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,875
He doesn't attack.

306
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,583
Did you see that? Did you see that?
I hit it!

307
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,042
I hit it! Oh my God.
I did it. I fucking did it!

308
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:56,875
I hit it right in the eye.
Oh my God, oh my God.

309
00:44:57,042 --> 00:45:00,542
Take a picture. 
Please take a picture of me.

310
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:03,750
- First Zombie Squad kill.
- One, two .... 

311
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:05,875
Cheese ...!

312
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:08,875
Did you get it?

313
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:13,833
Oh, we spoke on the phone. I am Daniel. 
This is Blake and Monica.

314
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,500
We are the Zombie Squad.

315
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:22,167
- God damn it.
- It is real. These are real dead people.

316
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:25,167
And that's a real zombie.
You killed him.

317
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:29,083
- I can't believe it.
- Can we just focus for one second, guys?

318
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,458
I'm so sorry.
We are more professional than this.

319
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:36,625
- You're the Zombie Squad?
- Yep.

320
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:39,208
- You are the Zombie Squad.
- Yeah, we are the Zombie Squad.

321
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:43,417
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I was just expecting something different.

322
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:47,792
So was this guy when he woke 
up this morning.

323
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:52,500
'Cause I hit him in the face
with an ax.

324
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:56,083
- Yeah, how did you find me?
- We tracked your iPhone, of course.

325
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,833
We're fucking nerds. It's what we do.
Technical shit. Let's cut the chit chat.

326
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,208
What did you find out?
What do the creatures want?

327
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,375
Revenge.

329
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,958
This is insane!

330
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:20,292
You? 
You have the gift?

331
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:23,292
The force is strong with this one.

332
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:25,167
Ok.

333
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:33,583
Martin, this is how we defeat them.
This is how we take them down.

334
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,125
- What do you mean?
- I mean ...

335
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:40,708
We create an army of our own.

336
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,708
I tried to get as much information 
as I could on my trip over.

337
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:48,542
Especially about Herzog. To defeat your
enemy, you must know your enemy.

338
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:52,083
This is Lieutenant Stavarin
from the Soviet army.

339
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,750
He and his battalion was captured 
during the battle of Kursk,

340
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:58,750
and brought here to the north of 
Norway as POWs.

341
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:02,417
In 44 they were all sent
to Kvenang mountain ..

342
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:05,000
..to build a road through 
the mountain pass.

343
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:10,000
But it was after they built the road 
that shit got ugly.

344
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:15,625
All of the prisoners were shot.
Shot to death!

345
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,625
No survivors.

346
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:22,250
And the man in charge?

347
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:24,167
Herzog.

348
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,667
Those bodies are still buried there.

349
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:33,500
Buried in the frozen soil.
Preserved, waiting...

350
00:48:36,458 --> 00:48:40,208
- Waiting for what?
- The same thing that drives Herzog.

351
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:44,875
Revenge. 
And guess who is gonna give it to them.

352
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,917
- The man who can raise the dead?
- Fucking yeah ...!

353
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:55,875
You guys go after Herzog. Try to slow him down 
and give us as much time as possible, ok?

354
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:58,750
- What if this doesn't work?
- It has to.

355
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:02,250
All we have to do is to get to Kvenang mountain,
find Stavarin, wake him back from the dead,

356
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:05,875
and bring him back to Talvik so he can 
help us fight Herzog and his men.

357
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:09,333
Easy. Besides ......

358
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:13,708
We got help.

359
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:21,000
Here we go.

360
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,167
He is our last hope.

361
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,625
Look, a tank.

363
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:11,500
- A visit at this hour?
- That was early.

365
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,875
Hello?

367
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,708
Look.
His army is growing bigger.

368
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:46,250
Glenn, are there any more towns or 
villages before he reaches Talvik?

369
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:51,208
- Maybe a few houses, but that's it.
- Good. So what he has now he will use for his attack.

370
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:55,833
Yeah, pretty much. That is until he starts killing the 
people of Talvik and makes them join him as well.

371
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,250
- How many people live in Talvik?
- About 3000.

372
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:03,375
What, holy shit! All the more reason for 
us to slow them down as much as we can.

373
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:10,292
Look. Do you know how to use one of those things?
Of course. I am from northern Norway, aren't I.

374
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:14,000
I don't know what that means.
Guys, pack light.

375
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:16,708
We're moving out. Now!

376
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:25,958
What the hell happened here?

377
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:28,875
What are the investigators saying?

378
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:32,833
They are not investigators, is's only 
Tom and Ole wearing white suits today.

379
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,333
They thought it might make them 
look more professional.

380
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:40,500
A forensic team with real investigators 
should get here later tonight.

381
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:45,208
- Do we have any witnesses?
- Not unless you can make the seagulls talk.

382
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,833
Seagulls..... yes.
That would make a damn good invention.

383
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
A gadget that translates
seagull language to human language.

384
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:56,417
That inventor would get filthy rich.

385
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:59,833
Get the bodies to Talvik
before the seagulls eat them.

386
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,125
And take lots of pictures, otherwise
Forensics will cut off my balls.

387
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:09,083
Boss, here are pictures
from the surveillance camera.

388
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,625
Isn't that...?

389
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:22,333
Lick me deep in my manpussy ....!

390
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:30,458
Okay, guys, guys!
We are in a hurry. Come on!

391
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,250
Come on, damn it!
We have things to do!

392
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,875
There they are.
And they have a tank, I see.

393
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:41,833
Yeah, they stole it from the museum.

394
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,417
Fuck!

395
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:50,208
- What is that?
- The largest tank and 40 or 50 zombies.

396
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:53,125
No, no, no.
That. What is that?

397
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:57,958
These are replicas of the binoculars that 
Han and Chewie used on the planet Hoth.

398
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:02,208
Did you guys know fun fact?
All of the Hoth scenes 

399
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:06,500
were filmed here in Norway.
This place called Finse.

400
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:11,708
Girls, could we please maybe focus on, 
you know, the Nazi zombies instead?

401
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:16,375
What do we do? Well, Daniel told us to slow 
them down, so that's what we're gonna do.

402
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:18,333
Look.

403
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:23,708
We need to get out there, get their attention 
and lure them into the swamps, right.

404
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:29,167
And then when they get stuck, we can use the fertilizer 
bombs we made and blow them into bits and pieces.

405
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,583
That sounds basically impossible.

406
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:35,500
And how are you planning on luring them 
out there? We need bait. Live bait.

407
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:39,125
Yes, we need someone to attract 
their attention.

408
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:42,125
Someone who is light on their feet.

409
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:47,042
Who knows these swamps and can move 
through them without getting stuck.

410
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:54,917
What?

411
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,792
No.

412
00:54:56,958 --> 00:55:00,000
No. That's a swamp.
I'm not getting out there.

413
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:04,042
Who says I won't get stuck?
And one more thing ...

414
00:55:04,208 --> 00:55:07,333
Those things are fucking zombies
who want to rip my face off.

415
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,458
Talvik is you hometown, am I right?

416
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:14,208
- Yeah.
- You must have people you love there.

417
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:19,125
Yeah. Especially one ma ... woman,
that I love.

418
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:25,208
- Long hair and big boobs.
- Do it for "her".

419
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:29,708
You just bring them here, 
and we'll do the rest. Capice?

420
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:41,625
Hey man? Martin?

421
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:45,083
- Yeah?
- Are you okay?

422
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah, I ...

423
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,958
First, we wake up a battalion 
of Nazi zombies,

424
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:56,208
and now I'm supposed to wake up
a bunch of dead Russian guys.

425
00:55:56,375 --> 00:55:59,208
Look, your arm, your power,

426
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:03,417
is the only thing that can take down 
Herzog at this point. Remember that.

427
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,667
If we don't succeed,

428
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:10,625
his power will keep growing
until he's unstoppable.

429
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,292
That, my friend,
is a big bowl of shit

430
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:19,375
that we don't want to live in.

431
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,167
Oh my God.
That is vile smelling.

432
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,208
How did it fill up the car so fast?
That smell ....!

433
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:40,250
- It's alright, he's just carsick or something.
- That smells foul.

434
00:56:40,417 --> 00:56:42,167
No, no, no no!

435
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:45,125
Fuck, that's disgusting!

436
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,042
That smells.

437
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:38,458
I didn't know it was an
ugly-nosed congress in town.

438
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,833
Come and get me, then.

439
00:57:46,208 --> 00:57:48,917
Come and get me if you dare.

440
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:11,417
Move!

441
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:17,792
Halt!

442
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:23,458
- It's working. They are following him.
- But not Herzog and most of his men. Shit.

443
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:29,667
No, no, it's ok. We got their attention. If we 
take these guys out, he will come for us instead.

444
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,667
Come on, Glenn!

445
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:40,875
Run faster!

446
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:03,833
Yes!

447
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:13,125
Come on, Glenn!

448
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,042
Yes.

449
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,875
- Run, Glenn!
- Faster!

450
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:27,750
Run, run!

451
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,333
Please, God.

452
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,542
Yes!

453
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:48,458
Oh my God, Blake!

454
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:52,500
USA, USA!

455
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:54,708
USA!

456
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:58,958
Fire!

457
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,458
Hey. The tank is moving.

458
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,500
That can't be good.

459
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:32,625
Run!

460
01:00:37,542 --> 01:00:39,042
Run!

461
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:49,625
Oh my God!

462
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,542
Talvik. Now.

463
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,333
Hey.

464
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,458
- Where are we?
- We're getting close.

465
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,833
But we're also stuck.

466
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:27,250
- Can I push it?
- I don't think that would help.

467
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:31,875
- Is it far? We could walk.
- We don't have that kind of time.

468
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:37,000
If only we could find something

469
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:41,167
to put under the car, you know.
Something that would give us traction.

470
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:44,083
Then I could get us out of here.

472
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,042
- There you are.
- Damn hard to find room for all the bodies.

473
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:42,917
The cooler is completely full. We had to throw 
the rest in the garage with some ice cubes.

474
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:46,583
- Sounds like a perfect solution.
- Thank you.

475
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:52,708
Mostly Germans and French. Hardly the vacation they 
envisioned when they got their tickets for Norway.

476
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:56,542
Having their heads and arms ripped off and 
entrails pulled out? I doubt it.

477
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,417
Unless they like that kind of kinky stuff.

478
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:07,667
- Should you do that?
- No.

479
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:10,917
- Shouldn't Forensics have been here by now?
- It was so windy down in Alta

480
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:15,208
that the plane couldn't land. They said 
they should be here tomorrow afternoon.

481
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:21,250
- It's perfect.
- What?

482
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,167
It's our chance.

483
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:29,125
Now, we can fucking show people
what we're made of here.

484
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:34,000
Us here at Talvik Police will
find Martin Hykkerud ourselves.

485
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:38,375
We will get him. Us.
We will be heroes.

486
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:42,500
Not the goddamn suit-cladded,

487
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:46,083
Sushi-eating cocksuckers down south.

488
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:49,208
Beef the guys....

489
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:54,542
Brief the guys. Send photos to all
the cops here in Talvik.

490
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:59,417
If he as much as stops to pee, I want to 
know the color and smell of his urine.

491
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:03,583
- Odor and color.
- And get the weapons ready.

492
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,250
For once we will shoot at something 
other that seagulls.

493
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:15,000
Do you really think this is 
going to work?

494
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:20,000
I mean, say we actually manage to wake 
these Russians back to life.

495
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:23,000
What's stopping them from killing us?

496
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:29,000
I don't know what's gonna happen.
But judging based on him?

497
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:33,083
He treats you like you're his master.
So hopefully they do the same.

498
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,208
Hopefully.

499
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:39,333
Hopefully .... I don't know, man.
This is some unprecedented, unheard of,

500
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:44,542
mysterious voodoo zombie shit, man.
I've never seen this before.

501
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:50,042
I've seen a thousand zombie movies,
and this is not in any of them.

502
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:54,000
You have created a whole 
new genre here, man.

503
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:58,500
Look, I mean, if we are gonna go up 
against a battalion of Nazi zombies,

504
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:02,500
we could do a whole lot worse than teaming 
up with a battalion of Russian zombies.

505
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:09,000
He has to die, you know. 
Herzog.

506
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:12,792
For what he did.
We have to kill him.

507
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:18,333
I have to kill him.
For Hanna.

508
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:24,833
- This is it.
- Yeah.

509
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:29,375
This is definitely it.

510
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:35,042
Herzog killed Stavarin
and 50 of his men here.

511
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:39,875
So they got be buried in 
this frozen ground.

512
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,125
How do we do this?

513
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,042
You do it ... 

514
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:48,958
just like you did .... with him.

515
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,792
I put my hand on his head.

516
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:55,542
Okay. Right.

517
01:06:57,417 --> 01:07:00,083
We can't dig up everyone.
It'll take weeks.

518
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:04,500
You have to wake them up,
one way or another.

519
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:31,167
Master!

520
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:39,042
Fuck, yeah!

521
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,542
He was first seen here.

522
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,958
In Oksfjord.

523
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:24,792
And next time here.
Museum at Ice Bay.

524
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:29,375
Then he appears to be heading south. 
Perhaps there.

525
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:33,333
We have a problem.

526
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:38,167
A gang dressed as Germans
going crazy out there?

527
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:41,375
Crazy?
They killed loads of people, so yeah.

528
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:46,333
What's happening. We haven't had a murder since 74,
and suddenly we have Ragnarok on our doorstep.

529
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:52,083
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Shoot first, ask later!

530
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:40,833
There is no one here.
We have sent them away.

531
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,208
They are gone.

532
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:48,708
Since you can't complete your mission,

533
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:53,375
you might as well just turn
and go back to your snow cave.

534
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:25,292
Some have grown a bit since last time.
Gotten a little bigger.

535
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:32,458
I brought a couple of buddies to 
the dance.

536
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:21,417
Don't you get a bitter feeling when 
somebody you thought were dead 

537
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:24,458
have come back to kill you?

538
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:53,875
Let's kill them.

539
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:55,458
Troops!

540
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:00,250
Attack!

541
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,833
Let's kill them all!

542
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:21,958
What the hell is going on here?
Is the carnival in town?

543
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:17,667
Is that a tank?

544
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,417
- Damn!
- Run!

545
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:31,167
Help!

546
01:16:58,083 --> 01:17:00,542
Daniel! Tank!

547
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,375
- Shouldn't we help them?
- Help who?

548
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:21,542
Those with bad skin in German uniforms or 
those with bad skin in Russian uniforms?

549
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:53,208
Okay.

550
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,000
Good boy.

551
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:24,125
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!
- What the hell is going on?

552
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:27,542
Damn if I know.
Looks like a video game.

553
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:30,167
Look, that's him. 
It's Martin Hykkerud!

554
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:33,583
- Damn, it's him.
- Should we get him?

555
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:37,083
No, no, no, no.
Let's wait until it calms down.

556
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,750
Tactical police work.

557
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:09,417
Zombie Squad. 
It's about time!

558
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:11,958
- That's a long story.
- There was a tank.

559
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:14,458
A guy took my jacket.

560
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:19,625
Looks like you found Stavarin and his men, I see.
Yeah, but they're still more than us.

561
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,625
I guess it's time we even 
out the odds a bit, huh.

562
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,250
Folks! We're losing!

563
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,292
Look!

564
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:16,042
Shit!

565
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:28,083
No, no, no.

566
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,333
No!

567
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:40,583
Wait!

568
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:43,583
We have to kill him!

569
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:46,458
They're all bound to him like the 
Russians are to you.

570
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:49,708
If he dies, the others will too.

571
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:55,458
Let's finish this.

572
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:59,458
Untermensch.

573
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:18,833
Guys, come on.
No seat belts?

574
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,208
You're asking for it.

575
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:53,958
Fucking hell!
How many more of these are there?

576
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,917
Is this it?

577
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:06,542
Monica, is this how it's gonna end?

578
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,417
No, no.

579
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,750
- Are we gonna die now?
- No.

580
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:16,250
Fuck it.

581
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,958
Fuck it, I'm just gonna say it.

582
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,083
I, 

583
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:26,042
Glenn Kenneth Toivonen, am ...

584
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,708
No!

585
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,625
- Blake!
- Glenn?

586
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,292
Monica ..

587
01:27:41,917 --> 01:27:44,917
Why didn't you just stay
on the mountain?

588
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:54,542
You got what you wanted.
You got the gold. The treasure.

589
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,917
But it was not enough.

590
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:06,833
You were greedy.

591
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,083
You wanted more.

592
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:12,167
Blake!

593
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:17,500
- Monica.
- Watch out.

594
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:22,292
- Monica!
- Blake!

595
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,625
Blake! No!

596
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:42,458
That's why you lost, you know.

597
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:46,000
Because you were greedy.

598
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:54,500
You know you lost the war?

599
01:28:56,292 --> 01:28:58,917
Lost everything.

600
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,542
Ridiculed.

601
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:06,042
Pathetic.

602
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:08,917
And you know what?

603
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:12,583
You lose again.

604
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,375
No!

605
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:38,292
Oh my God!

606
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,292
He did it!

607
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:48,583
- He killed Herzog.
- It worked. I knew it.

608
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:52,417
Herzog is dead.

609
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:54,833
He is dead. Yes!

610
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:13,083
Holy cow, that was close.

611
01:30:24,917 --> 01:30:28,333
You did it!
You killed Herzog?

612
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:32,750
I can't believe that 
that actually worked,

613
01:30:32,917 --> 01:30:35,583
Of course it did.

614
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,542
You doubted the Zombie Squad?

615
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:42,708
Glenn Kenneth, is he ...?

616
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:47,208
He didn't make it.

617
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:02,375
It's been a true honor killing 
zombies with you guys.

618
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,125
You too, Martin.

619
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,958
What is it? 
Okay.

620
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:17,833
- You can say it.
- Go for it.

621
01:31:21,167 --> 01:31:23,875
May the Force be with you.

622
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:31,375
Really? That one?
Of all ...? You chose that one?

623
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:35,667
There's like a million to chose from,
why would you chose that one?

624
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:03,125
- Where the hell are they? They were just here. 
- Damn if I know.

625
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:07,042
Damn! Bjarne!

626
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,250
Are you in a coma?

627
01:32:10,417 --> 01:32:12,792
Go and find them, damn it!

628
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:21,875
I should have solved this case.
Ending up with a hundred new bodies...

629
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:27,083
Where do we put them all?
The garage and the cooler are packed.

630
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,500
I don't know! I don't know.

631
01:32:36,417 --> 01:32:41,625
The seagulls again. They haven't
eaten this good since the war.

632
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:47,250
We should have had the 
damn machine, you know.

633
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:50,667
A machine to translate seagull 
language to human language.

634
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:54,500
Then we would have cracked this case
