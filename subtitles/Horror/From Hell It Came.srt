1
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:36,128
Kimo, you have committed
the greatest crime of all.

2
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,156
You have betrayed
your own people.

3
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,890
You have caused the
death of your own father,

4
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,346
once our mighty chief!

5
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:50,707
For these sins
you must die!

6
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:52,867
Tano, you know
I am innocent!

7
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,602
My father died from
the Black Plague.

8
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:57,670
Lies will not save you!

9
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:01,956
The devil dust of your American
friends killed our great chief,

10
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,899
killed many of
our people!

11
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:07,505
Tano, you fear the Americans because
their medicine is stronger than yours!

12
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:10,333
They come here as
our friends to help us!

13
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,013
Friends?

14
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,910
Why didn't the Americans
heal your father?

15
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:18,740
You all know I was his
father's best friend.

16
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:21,293
I begged our
great chief,

17
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,685
do not listen to the false
voices of the strangers.

18
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:26,915
Listen to Tano,
the wise one!

19
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,553
His medicine will make
you strong and well again.

20
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:32,342
My father was sick and out
of his mind with fever!

21
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:36,319
Tano gave him the poison because
you wanted to become the new chief!

22
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,516
You and Tano are the
guilty ones! You should die!

23
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,365
The evil spirits have
seized Kimo's mind!

24
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,364
- His tongue has become a serpent.
- I tell the truth!

25
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,697
Ask my wife Korey.

26
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:52,453
She was caring for my father when
Tano and Maranka came with the poison!

27
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:55,951
- What is it you wish me to say, Kimo?
- The truth!

28
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,605
Tell them the truth,

29
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:58,755
that Tano and Maranka

30
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:00,799
gave him the evil medicine
that killed him!

31
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:02,834
What medicine, my husband?

32
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,525
The only thing he drank

33
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:05,716
was the medicine you brought

34
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,239
from the American doctor.

35
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:10,685
Do you hear the truth from
the wife of the guilty one?

36
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:13,855
You broke the
law of our tribe

37
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,895
when you brought your
father to the Americans!

38
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:19,070
It was their fiendish, unholy
devil dust that made him sick!

39
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,942
Their medicine
that killed him!

40
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:23,775
For that you
must die!

41
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:28,069
Korey, why have
you betrayed me?

42
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,997
I will come back from the
grave to revenge for myself.

43
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:35,920
Tano!

44
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:39,639
You can kill my body,
but my spirit will never die!

45
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,713
In death I will be
stronger than you in life!

46
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:48,298
Maranka, your days
are numbered.

47
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,027
And the gods curse you
and Tano and Korey!

48
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,055
I promise you all,

49
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:59,406
I shall come back from hell and
make you pay for your crimes!

50
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,020
How come the travel posters
never mention the drums?

51
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:53,973
Islands of romance.
Islands of beauty.

52
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:57,870
How come they never talk about
the malaria and the jungle rots,

53
00:05:58,123 --> 00:05:59,607
the fever and the heat,

54
00:06:00,518 --> 00:06:03,757
the stupid blind ignorance,
and those drums?

55
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,397
Yes, that propaganda they feed

56
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,680
the innocent tourist is enough

57
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,488
to drive a man to drink.

58
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:11,125
If I ever go back to the States,
which seems unlikely,

59
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:13,199
I'll become a research
chemist in a distillery,

60
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,012
and combine business
with pleasure.

61
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:17,373
You better lay off
that stuff, Professor.

62
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:19,250
You'll wake up in the
morning with a hangover,

63
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,126
but the drums
will still be here.

64
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,769
Drums don't bother me, Doc.

65
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:25,622
As a matter of fact, they have
a nice anthropological beat.

66
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:28,797
Well, maybe we oughta record it,
get it on the hit parade.

67
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:35,553
All kidding aside, those
drums sound like trouble.

68
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,518
Trouble for us, I'm afraid.

69
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:40,069
Ever since the old chief died,

70
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:43,050
the natives have been staring
at us with hate in their eyes.

71
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:44,698
I tried to save his life,

72
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,358
but the old chief was
too far gone from the

73
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,595
brew of bacteria the
witch doctor fed him.

74
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,286
By the time I got there,
he was paralyzed,

75
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:52,308
practically dead.

76
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,139
I know.
You did your best, Doc.

77
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:00,671
No need to be nervous.

78
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:03,558
Ordinarily, the natives on this
island are peaceful enough.

79
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,321
You mean they were
peaceful enough

80
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,365
until they dropped that atom
bomb on the Nogassa Atoll.

81
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,664
1500 miles from here.

82
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:12,848
Who would have thought
that a freak typhoon could

83
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:15,332
come out of nowhere and
wreck all calculations.

84
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:19,175
Well, the facts remain that the
atomic fallout landed here

85
00:07:19,195 --> 00:07:23,593
and that we trusty scientists
from the International Foundation

86
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:26,607
came running with our little
Geiger counters to investigate.

87
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,133
What did we find? Plague!

88
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:30,659
That's what's killing off the natives.
It's not the fallout.

89
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,855
A little knowledge is
a dangerous thing.

90
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:39,930
You know, they heard about
the fallout from the sailors

91
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,390
on the boats that trade
with the islands.

92
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:46,493
They think of it as
some kind of "devil dust".

93
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:49,172
A curse brought along by
the evil Americans.

94
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:51,546
We know that's
so much eye wash.

95
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:53,457
We've checked the radiation
on this island,

96
00:07:53,477 --> 00:07:55,588
it's only 3.05 roentgen.

97
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,117
Hardly any more than an
ordinary dental X-ray.

98
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:02,325
Sure, reasons on our side, but
they don't seem to be buying it.

99
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,338
I'll tell you who poisons
their simple minds.

100
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,783
It's Tano, their witch doctor.

101
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:09,192
He's afraid of losing his
patients to modern medicine.

102
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:13,086
Wants to keep them steeped
in their century old superstitions.

103
00:08:13,106 --> 00:08:15,824
They worship him like some
kind of high priest.

104
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,707
Back in the States they don't
regard doctors that way.

105
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,355
Sometimes they don't
even pay their bills.

106
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:23,513
I know what's on your mind.

107
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,471
It's written all over you.

108
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:25,875
You'd like to go back
home, wouldn't you?

109
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,598
Is it that evident?

110
00:08:30,997 --> 00:08:34,156
Sure, I'd go back tomorrow, only...

111
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:37,428
Only you'd like to take a bride
with you and the girl says "no".

112
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,981
Terry Mason's doing a
great job on Baku Island.

113
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:43,253
I don't think the Foundation
would want to lose her.

114
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,775
Why did I have to fall in love
with a dedicated female scientist?

115
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,976
She considers marriage
some kind of prison.

116
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:53,384
What do you expect from a pretty
girl two years out of med college?

117
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:55,530
She wants excitement, adventure.

118
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,821
She thinks of routine as
a middle age thing.

119
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:00,412
There are sometimes I could
kick her beautiful teeth in.

120
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:03,392
Here I offer her the earth,
the moon, the stars...

121
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:06,379
and she prefers test tubes
and a tiny Pacific atoll.

122
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:09,440
Forget her!
Find somebody else.

123
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,410
I've tried!
Dozens of times.

124
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,004
Well?

125
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:23,282
There's nothing like a cup of
your battery acid to pep you up.

126
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,254
Only it needs a little more acid.

127
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:31,094
Generator 3 was acting up.

128
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:32,953
Luckily, I caught it just in time.

129
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,746
All I can say is Jones and Pierce
sure picked a good time to

130
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:37,905
to go over to Taenga Atoll
with Reverend Cameron.

131
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,288
They could've give me a hand.

132
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:40,800
Ah, coffee?

133
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,462
That's a very good idea.

134
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,688
It'll taste better if you put
a little iodine in it.

135
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,603
I better drink it before
it melts the spoon.

136
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:17,578
Doc! Eddie! It's Mrs. Kilgore!

137
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:26,683
I warned her never to
leave the trading post

138
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:28,646
during one of the
native ceremonies.

139
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:31,450
- Eddie, take her to the lab.
- Okay, Doc.

140
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,179
- Eddie, get me a wet towel.
- Check.

141
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:39,519
Oh, save me, save me,
help me!

142
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:42,077
Easy, Mrs. Kilgore, easy.
Relax, your perfectly safe.

143
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:43,229
You're among friends.

144
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:46,618
Oh, it's awful. I was there.
I saw them kill Kimo.

145
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:49,853
The bloomin' cannibals. They
stuck a knife right in his heart.

146
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:52,035
It was horrible, simply horrible!

147
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:54,786
And that native outside, he'd liked
to have killed me if he could.

148
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:57,447
You're all right now, Mrs. Kilgore.
No ones going to hurt you now.

149
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,639
Nightmares the rest of me
natural life. The heathens.

150
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,865
They ought to drop a bloomin'
hydrogen bomb on 'em all

151
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,384
- and blow 'em to pieces.
- Now, Mrs. Kilgore

152
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,095
try to control yourself.

153
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:13,678
Don't be stingy at a
time like this, Deary.

154
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:23,571
My goodness, I must look ghastly
in front of you gentlemen.

155
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:27,674
There's nothing else I can do now.
If you want me, I'll be in the radio room.

156
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:02,985
[Speaking native language]

157
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:18,614
Mrs. Kilgore?

158
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:21,910
You passed a cemetery during
a native ceremony.

159
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:24,340
That's why they sent a man
out to try to kill you.

160
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,220
Why, I just had to see you, Doctor.

161
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,658
I ran out of that ducky medicine
you gave me for my nerves.

162
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,137
Doctor, you can't imagine
the lonely life of a widow.

163
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,531
Two husbands I've buried

164
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:38,813
and now their's no
one to care for me.

165
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,261
Well, if we hadn't heard
you scream, Mrs. Kilgore,

166
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:44,276
we might be burying you beside
you latest lamented husband.

167
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:46,576
Well, I just couldn't
stand those drums.

168
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:48,864
Gave me a terrible
case of the jitters.

169
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:52,892
Oh, that horrible brute.
I think he hit me.

170
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:56,048
Doctor, wouldn't you
like to examine me,

171
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,319
see if I've suffered
any injuries?

172
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,043
Mrs. Kilgore, you appear
to be in excellent shape.

173
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:04,296
I'm afraid you're more
frightened, than hurt.

174
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,366
Seems like every
place you go on this

175
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:10,283
bloomin' island you break
a tribal law or something.

176
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:12,713
Soon as I find a buyer
for the trading post,

177
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:14,910
I'm taking off for
Australia like a bird.

178
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,831
I'm going to open
a little tea shop.

179
00:14:19,222 --> 00:14:21,604
After two years in
this bloomin' rat hole,

180
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:23,880
I think I'll open a pub instead.

181
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:25,840
Well, until you do leave, Mrs. Kilgore,

182
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,082
I advise you to give the
natives a wide berth.

183
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:29,998
Well, I like that!

184
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,984
My poor Eddie and me,
we opened the trading post

185
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:37,135
to help these
unfortunate people.

186
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:40,115
And you made a nice profit
trading beads and knives

187
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:42,628
in exchange for copra
and the occasional pearls.

188
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:45,684
Now that's not a
nice thing to say.

189
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:49,709
I bet you're getting paid handsomely
by that International Atomic

190
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:51,562
"whatsit" that sent you here!

191
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,909
I don't know why you want to
study those natives for anyway.

192
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:58,104
Mrs. Kilgore, I'm afraid you
don't understand them

193
00:14:58,124 --> 00:15:00,105
the way the good
professor does.

194
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,129
He considers them civilized in
their own delightful

195
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:04,697
primitive way.

196
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:08,777
Why, he'll tell you a human sacrifice
is no worse than a traffic accident.

197
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:11,244
I still don't know why
they killed Kimo.

198
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:14,089
Such a nice polite fellow.

199
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:16,652
Good looking too.

200
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:19,979
He committed the crime of learning
something about modern science.

201
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,829
He wanted to help his people.

202
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:23,124
And for that they killed him.

203
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:25,025
Terrible thing.

204
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:27,128
He was our one link with the natives.

205
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,142
Our one chance to lick the plague.

206
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:32,776
Well, whether they like it or not,
we've got to stop this epidemic.

207
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,715
Once we do that,
they'll trust us again.

208
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:37,353
Of course, I'm not
educated like you two

209
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:38,541
but it doesn't take much

210
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:39,546
brains to see there's all

211
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:40,729
kinds of strange things

212
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:42,178
going on in this island.

213
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:44,589
You're right about that, Mrs. Kilgore.

214
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:45,935
As a matter of fact

215
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:48,358
I think we could use some
more help to study the situation.

216
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:50,406
I'll mention that now in my
report to Washington.

217
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:38,891
Terry.

218
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:41,125
Oh, Bill...

219
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:45,924
Oh, your pulse needs to be steadied.
You seem to be running a fever.

220
00:17:45,944 --> 00:17:48,586
At times like this a violent
chemical reaction sets in.

221
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:50,965
May I prescribe a cold shower?

222
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:52,307
Oh, I've already had one.

223
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:53,627
We have our own shower.

224
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:56,360
We built it out of the finest
rusty pipe we could find.

225
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:58,065
Sounds like real luxury.

226
00:17:58,309 --> 00:17:59,956
Oh, Terry, you remember
Eddie, don't you?

227
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,004
He worked in Baku for awhile.

228
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:01,839
Eddie!

229
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,909
- Sure.
- Hello, Eddie.

230
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,430
Good to see you
again, Dr. Mason.

231
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:10,176
- Can I get your bags?
- Yes, Please. Thanks Eddie.

232
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:12,878
Terry, this isn't fair.

233
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:15,341
I won't be able to keep my mind
on my work with you here.

234
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,275
I wish they'd sent
somebody else.

235
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,228
Then, this isn't your doing?

236
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:21,096
You mean having
you ordered here?

237
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:23,025
Oh, you know how I
feel about you, Terry.

238
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:24,364
This is a danger spot.

239
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:27,918
- A little plague doesn't worry me.
- Ah, something worse.

240
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:29,922
See that?

241
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:34,809
Their witch doctor's got
them all stirred up.

242
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:38,240
Terry, why don't you go back to Baku.
Have them send somebody else.

243
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,587
I've never dodged an assignment yet, Bill.

244
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,631
Dr. Falkner and Dr. Curly are my bosses.

245
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:45,453
I can take orders only from them.

246
00:18:47,072 --> 00:18:48,272
Well...

247
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,241
Okay, let's go.

248
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:46,655
Welcome to the island
of forgotten scientists, Terry.

249
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,328
You can imagine how pleased we

250
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:49,483
were when Washington radioed

251
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:50,259
you're on the way.

252
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,308
Oh, thank you.

253
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:53,157
Professor, it's so good to see you.

254
00:19:53,177 --> 00:19:54,029
How's the work going?

255
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:56,476
Fine. I think you'll find
our tests very interesting.

256
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,788
Well, I'm sure I will.

257
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,346
We can talk shop later.

258
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:02,116
- I'm sure you want to unpack first anyway.
- Well...

259
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:04,435
I'm doing some work in the
lab and I'll see you at lunch.

260
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:06,492
Give me all the Foundation
gossip from Baku.

261
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:08,393
Professor, it'll be a pleasure.

262
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:12,011
Oh...

263
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,284
Terry, this is Mrs. Kilgore.
She runs the trading post.

264
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:17,335
They told me a lady
doctor was coming,

265
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:20,095
but I figured it would be one
of them beanpole spinsters.

266
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:23,171
Well, I'm a spinster
all right, Mrs. Kilgore.

267
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,960
But you ain't no beanpole,
that's for certain.

268
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,303
My, that's a lovely suit.

269
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:31,545
Why thank you. I bought it
on my last trip to Hawaii.

270
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,191
Mmmm, that perfume
smells real nice.

271
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:36,956
That come from Hawaii too?

272
00:20:36,976 --> 00:20:39,398
No, I brought that
from the States.

273
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:42,528
It's Arpege and I have an
extra bottle if you'd like one.

274
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,302
Why that right nice
of you, Ducky.

275
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:46,954
I mean, Dr. Mason.

276
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:50,086
Why that's all right, Mrs. Kilgore.
You needn't be so formal.

277
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:52,630
You call me Ducky or Docy
or anything you want to.

278
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:56,804
I will, Deary.
And you call me Meg.

279
00:20:57,668 --> 00:20:59,208
Oh, ah...Ducky?

280
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,930
- Yes, Docy.
- We've got your quarters ready.

281
00:21:04,475 --> 00:21:06,333
Mrs. Kilgore will take you over.

282
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:07,836
I'll drop by later
and pick you up.

283
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:10,549
I knew you'd be tired
from the trip, Ducky,

284
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,058
so I got a native girl to help you.

285
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:17,567
Oh, I thought Dr. Arnold said the
natives were angry with us outsiders.

286
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:21,350
The tribe considers Orchid an outcast.
She's the girl I got for you.

287
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:24,403
And being an outcast she's
not subject to tribal law.

288
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:26,888
Her mother was a native,
but her father was Dutch.

289
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:30,378
When her parents died, she was raised
by Reverend Cameron, the missionary.

290
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:33,486
- You want these bags now, Dr. Mason?
- Yes, please. Thanks, Eddie.

291
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:34,594
Come along, Deary.

292
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,388
Oh, Terry?

293
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:39,008
Yes...

294
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:43,171
I'm glad you stayed.

295
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:48,964
Thanks.

296
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,038
I hope that you like it here.

297
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:15,677
Oh, it's very nice,
I'm sure I will.

298
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:18,681
- Orchid, this is Dr. Mason.
- Hello, Orchid

299
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:21,734
Eddie, I wonder if you can
take me back to my quarters?

300
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:25,039
- I'd be glad to, Mrs. Kilgore.
- Oh, wait a minute, Meg.

301
00:22:28,161 --> 00:22:30,284
Mustn't forget that perfume
I promised you.

302
00:22:30,997 --> 00:22:32,058
Thanks, Deary.

303
00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:33,908
Eddie, we'd better be going.

304
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,814
- See you later.
- All right.

305
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,107
Why do they call you Orchid?

306
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,329
Because they say I'm wild,
like our flowers.

307
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,483
I'm glad that they picked
me to be your servant.

308
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:02,576
Maybe I can earn money
to go to other island.

309
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,468
There they will not care
that I am an outcast.

310
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:08,292
Then maybe I will marry.

311
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,752
- Are you married?
- No.

312
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:13,634
Perhaps if I were, I may
not have come here.

313
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:17,352
Orchid, how do you come to
speak such good english?

314
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:19,789
The Reverend Cameron
taught me how.

315
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:21,565
He's been like a father to me.

316
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,510
- You certainly learned it well.
- Thank you.

317
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:27,236
You know, I think we'll
get along fine.

318
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,756
Terry, are you ready?

319
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:49,925
I thought I'd show you around
the lab before lunch.

320
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:52,361
Eddie, you're early.

321
00:23:53,206 --> 00:23:55,633
I see you're enjoying
our luxury.

322
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:58,197
It's wonderful!

323
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:00,592
I'll be over as soon
as I'm dressed.

324
00:24:02,145 --> 00:24:02,783
Okay.

325
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:24,249
Norgu.

326
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,968
I'm glad to see you.

327
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:30,020
After Tano's orders

328
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,428
forbidding the natives
to come here

329
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:32,798
I thought I'd never
see you again.

330
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:34,349
I was Kimo's best friend.

331
00:24:34,898 --> 00:24:36,522
I think the same way he did.

332
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:38,757
That you have come
to help our people.

333
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:41,677
Tano could do nothing
for my wife Dori.

334
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:43,737
He does not know how to
fight the plague sickness,

335
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:45,381
nor the marks on her face.

336
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,391
Dori, sit here.

337
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:55,080
Ah, your face shows improvement.

338
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:57,258
You are healing her, Doctor.

339
00:24:57,812 --> 00:25:01,028
Others in the village know you have chased
away the evil spirits with your medicine.

340
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:03,375
Nargu, this plague is very serious.

341
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:05,075
Talk to as many of
your people as you

342
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:06,840
dare and get them to
come here for treatment

343
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,743
in spite of the danger.

344
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,929
Tano has no medicine
to cure the plague.

345
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:13,671
There are many who do not trust
you since Kimo's father died, Doctor.

346
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:16,023
But it was Tano who gave
him the poison medicine.

347
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:18,929
Kimo said that too,
before they killed him.

348
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:21,797
I believe it,
but others do not.

349
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:33,632
Well, Dr. Mason.

350
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:38,055
This is Dori.
I'd like you to look at her.

351
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,722
She's recovering from the plague, but seems
to have suffered a slight radiation burn also.

352
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:46,586
Had she a history of jungle rot or
dermatitis before the fallout came?

353
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,295
She had a history of eczema.

354
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,454
It seemed to be almost cured
before the fallout landed here.

355
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:53,518
Before the former chief died

356
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:54,447
and son was killed

357
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,351
the natives came to us for treatment.

358
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:57,989
However, the new
chief, Maranka,

359
00:25:58,009 --> 00:25:59,236
and his witch doctor Tano,

360
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:00,670
forbid the natives to come here.

361
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,552
Those who do are taking
their lives in their hands.

362
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,467
From the look of the scar tissue

363
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:07,557
it seems to be responding
to your treatment.

364
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,804
Terry!

365
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:12,922
You specialize in dermatology and
the removal of excessive scar tissue.

366
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,359
Have you any ideas?

367
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:18,265
It would help our situation here with the
natives if we could speed up a recovery.

368
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:22,720
Let's try formula X-37. We had some
good results on Baku with it.

369
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,964
We can begin treatment soon
as the supplies are unpacked.

370
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:31,354
Terry, I hear that your group on Baku have
rebuilt human tissue destroyed by jungle rot.

371
00:26:31,374 --> 00:26:33,119
Yes, we had some luck, I guess.

372
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,800
Let's hope your luck holds out.

373
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:38,725
Dori, come back tomorrow and
we'll try Dr. Mason's new medicine.

374
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:40,781
I will bring her. Thank you.

375
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:43,977
I'm glad you have confidence
in Dr. Arnold, Norgu.

376
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,517
He's a good man.

377
00:26:46,128 --> 00:26:47,508
Not evil, like Tano!

378
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:49,296
Come, Dori.

379
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,296
Our progress with these
natives is very slow, Terry.

380
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:57,436
Their superstitions
are so deep rooted.

381
00:26:57,456 --> 00:26:58,643
Yes, I know.

382
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:02,286
Well, where's that lunch
you promised me?

383
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:05,816
You're looking at the
best French chef

384
00:27:06,145 --> 00:27:07,408
on this island.

385
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:09,736
And wait until you taste his coffee.

386
00:27:25,939 --> 00:27:30,185
It was for you that I helped
kill Kimo, my husband.

387
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:34,634
And since he died the fire
of your love has grown cold.

388
00:27:35,342 --> 00:27:38,244
I could never have a traitor
like you as my wife.

389
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,561
Get out of here!

390
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:46,145
I know that you make those poison
darts to kill the Americans.

391
00:27:47,178 --> 00:27:48,690
You are afraid of them.

392
00:27:49,911 --> 00:27:53,235
You throw me out so that
you can make love to Naomi.

393
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,704
You come from her
hut many times.

394
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:08,902
I picked the poison berries for you.

395
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:12,292
We have enough, Naomi.
We will go now.

396
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:25,394
This could be for you, just as
easily as for the Americans.

397
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:03,028
Here you are, Terry.

398
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:08,450
Natures own flower shop.

399
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:12,623
Orchids, Hibiscus, you name
them, we have them.

400
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,587
Thanks, Bill.
It's very lovely.

401
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,568
Almost as lovely as you are.

402
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,882
I'm gonna fill your head every
morning with jungle flowers.

403
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,460
That's one of the advantages of
living in this primitive area.

404
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,168
You can give your girl a
fortune in flowers

405
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,548
and it doesn't cost a cent.

406
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:09,444
Terry...

407
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,799
Bill, Dear. I'm not your girl,
or anybodies girl.

408
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:18,702
Why do you have to be so stubborn?
Why don't you admit you love me?

409
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,269
Then, when Reverend
Cameron comes back,

410
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,715
he can marry us and we
can go back to the States

411
00:30:22,735 --> 00:30:24,631
and live like
normal people.

412
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,185
Depends on what
you call normal.

413
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:31,085
Being couped up in
a stuffy apartment

414
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:33,555
having my ears blasted
by rock & roll music

415
00:30:33,903 --> 00:30:35,395
isn't my idea of normal.

416
00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:39,367
Rock & Roll? Wait until you hear the
native drums. They'll really rock you.

417
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:44,063
Terry, what do you
want out of life?

418
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:46,543
Do you wanna go

419
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:49,669
from one assignment to another, out
here on the islands, like the Professor?

420
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:52,132
Do you want to go through life alone?

421
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:54,688
Don't you want a husband,

422
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,050
children,

423
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,740
like other women?

424
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:10,811
You do love me, don't you?

425
00:31:12,116 --> 00:31:13,055
Admit it.

426
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:15,733
I don't love you.

427
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:18,155
The why'd you kiss me back?

428
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:22,296
I don't know.

429
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:27,615
My metabolism.

430
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,549
It was unconscious, involuntary.

431
00:31:31,795 --> 00:31:34,462
Terry, will you stop being a
doctor first and a woman second.

432
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:37,391
Let your emotions rule you,
not your intellect.

433
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:42,009
Bill, I live by my intellect, reason.

434
00:31:42,873 --> 00:31:44,817
If I let my emotions run away,

435
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:48,122
I wouldn't be any good in my work.

436
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:06,336
Bill, isn't that the native cemetery
that Orchid was telling me about?

437
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:09,021
That's where they buried Kimo.

438
00:32:09,155 --> 00:32:12,103
Oh, the one Mrs. Kilgore
saw murdered.

439
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:14,160
The one with the knife in his heart.

440
00:32:14,883 --> 00:32:17,009
His grave should be
somewhere over there.

441
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:20,821
- I'd like to see it.
- Hmm?

442
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:25,009
- Oh, it's taboo territory?
- Un huh.

443
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:30,192
Well, who's afraid of the
local medicine man?

444
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,957
Strange. An odd looking stump.

445
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:48,192
Seems to be breaking the
ground round the grave.

446
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:52,643
Could it be a growth from
the roots of another tree?

447
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:54,547
I don't know.

448
00:32:57,918 --> 00:32:59,683
We better get Clark
out here to look at it.

449
00:32:59,965 --> 00:33:02,397
He's an expert on jungle
trees and plants.

450
00:33:12,168 --> 00:33:16,646
Well, it isn't very likely that a tree or the
stump of one would sprout out of a grave.

451
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:19,234
It'd have to penetrate
a six foot coffin.

452
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,107
Orchid says Kimo was
buried in a six foot coffin.

453
00:33:22,426 --> 00:33:24,680
Could a tree trunk grow
out of a coffin?

454
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:27,576
Who knows? Science doesn't
have all the answers, yet.

455
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:30,449
It's probably the malformed
growth of a tropical bush.

456
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,592
Nothing particularly
unusual about that.

457
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,883
Professor, that's not a bush!

458
00:33:35,287 --> 00:33:37,419
No, it's a tree all right.

459
00:33:37,439 --> 00:33:40,958
Don't tell me that matured stumps
come ready made from the ground.

460
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:43,691
The next thing you know...
Hello, Nargu.

461
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:49,700
Nargu, what is it?

462
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,564
Kimo's curse has come through.

463
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:55,615
His spirit returns from the grave!

464
00:33:55,831 --> 00:33:57,944
- You mean this?
- Yes.

465
00:33:58,444 --> 00:34:01,834
Nargu, I thought you didn't believe
in that witch doctor hocus pocus.

466
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:06,744
I have heard of stories like this from my
grandfather who was storyteller of the tribe.

467
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:08,644
Oh, you mean it's a legend,
a made up story?

468
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:09,284
No!

469
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,317
No, it's the truth.

470
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:17,462
Years ago, one of our great chiefs
was murdered by his enemies.

471
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:20,289
He was buried with seeds.

472
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:23,134
He came back to life

473
00:34:23,744 --> 00:34:25,213
as a tree monster.

474
00:34:25,852 --> 00:34:27,213
Tree monster!

475
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:30,607
Oh, now Norgu, I know about
cannibalistic flowers,

476
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:33,073
but this tree monster is
utterly unbelievable.

477
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:36,111
Dr. Mason, you are wise lady,

478
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:40,345
but there are many things even
the wisest of us do not know.

479
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,509
This tree monster

480
00:34:44,267 --> 00:34:47,084
was torn loose from the
ground by a bolt of lightning.

481
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:49,324
It roamed the island.

482
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,666
Killed many people.

483
00:34:53,122 --> 00:34:54,164
They called it...

484
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,330
Tabanga!

485
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,334
Tabanga, what does that mean?

486
00:34:59,594 --> 00:35:03,020
- Creature of revenge.
- What happened to this monster?

487
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,155
It just disappeared one day,
never came back.

488
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,910
Some say it walked into the
quicksand at the edge of the forest.

489
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:14,126
No one knew for sure.

490
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:22,548
I just came from Mrs. Kilgore,
by way of the cemetery.

491
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:24,943
I happened to pass Kimo's grave.

492
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,933
There's a strange growth
from the ground.

493
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:30,989
It has a ceremonial
dagger in it's heart.

494
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:33,299
See, Kimo's coming back!

495
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:37,177
It looks so terrible, with
green stuff coming from it.

496
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,614
Like green blood from a dying man.

497
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:44,096
Well, obviously there's something there.
We'd better go and investigate it.

498
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,256
You're right, Howard.
There is an irregular heart beat.

499
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,152
Terry, give me the reading.

500
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:55,096
This tallies with the lateral pulse.
It's a human heart beat!

501
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:58,893
What do you make
of that green ooze?

502
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:01,970
Probably the equivalent of blood,
the stuff that keeps it alive.

503
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,589
Let's take a sample.

504
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:09,811
Stand back!

505
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:12,824
Geiger reading gets high,
...on 65!

506
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,135
Radioactive material in this thing!

507
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:18,670
The Tabanga will soon remove
itself from the ground.

508
00:36:19,965 --> 00:36:22,796
You mean this wooden zombie's
going to uproot itself from the earth?

509
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:25,386
Your grandfather must have
been quite a storyteller.

510
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:26,963
Please Professor,

511
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:30,535
if this one is like the other Tabanga,
you must destroy it at once.

512
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:35,211
I beg you, pull up the roots so it will
die before it murders everyone.

513
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:39,549
Maybe you could throw it into the
quicksand at the edge of the forest.

514
00:36:39,803 --> 00:36:42,939
Norgu, what you fear is
scientifically impossible.

515
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:50,718
You know what, I have an eerie feeling
that this thing knows what we're saying.

516
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:15,228
Professor, this is the reply from
your message to Washington.

517
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:17,818
"Request you remove growth."

518
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:19,865
"Make thorough laboratory analysis."

519
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:23,218
"Have Arnold and Mason determine
influence of radiation, if any."

520
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:24,907
"Radio detailed report."

521
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:27,281
"Mail photos as soon as possible."
"Falkner"

522
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:29,565
Well, that's that.

523
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:31,875
- Better get busy.
- Thank you, Eddie.

524
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:36,235
Well, the first thing to do is go out and
dig up the monster and bring it to the lab.

525
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:39,220
That won't be easy. The roots
probably go quite deep.

526
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,881
Yeah, we'll probably have to separate each
root at soil level and seal it with stitches.

527
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:45,708
I imagine the natives
are in an uproar.

528
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:48,553
Like Nargu, they probably feel
the monster is another Tabanga.

529
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:51,864
If moving that monster violates
another tribal law, we'll be in for it.

530
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:55,164
You know we're greatly outnumbered here.
They could easily overpower us.

531
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:59,648
And don't forget what Nargu said about it being
taboo for strangers to go near the Tabanga.

532
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:02,016
Well, I say let's get started.

533
00:38:02,036 --> 00:38:04,658
And I say let's throw it in the
quicksand. Forget about it.

534
00:38:04,678 --> 00:38:07,822
Well, they blame us for everything as it is.
This could be the final straw.

535
00:38:07,842 --> 00:38:09,982
Where's your scientific curiosity, Doctor?

536
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,445
Anyway, Washington wants us to investigate
it, so let's take a risk and see what happens.

537
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,744
Professor, Bill is worried about me.

538
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:22,940
Now look, Bill. I can handle
a gun if the occasion arises.

539
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:25,957
Remember, we're both
working for the Foundation.

540
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:28,781
Well, I see I'm out voted.

541
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:33,848
All right, if you people feel like chopping
wood, I don't mind a little exercise.

542
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,983
Let's go get the choppers.

543
00:38:40,222 --> 00:38:42,879
Nargu has disobeyed the
taboo at the Americans.

544
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:44,795
He must die with them.

545
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:47,264
Nargu has many friends in the tribe.

546
00:38:47,373 --> 00:38:50,698
- We must be careful.
- I say he must die.

547
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:52,960
In good time.

548
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,196
First,

549
00:38:59,915 --> 00:39:03,244
I will spread this powerful medicine
at the base of the new Tabanga.

550
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:06,722
It will go to the roots...

551
00:39:07,408 --> 00:39:10,727
Tabanga will become my servant
and will kill when I tell it to!

552
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:15,964
Nargu will be it's victim!

553
00:39:22,671 --> 00:39:25,375
I will place the medicine
on the Tabanga.

554
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:28,990
The 4th day after 2 full moons...

555
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:32,586
so has the spirit told me.

556
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:38,913
You'll remember, Tano,
Korey must also die.

557
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:46,957
Nargu,

558
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:51,417
isn't this Korey, the wife
of your dead friend, Kimo?

559
00:39:52,075 --> 00:39:54,901
You are Chief Maranka's woman.
What do you come here for?

560
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:56,507
He no longer loves me.

561
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,966
He would take Naomi
to be his wife.

562
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:01,405
Korey, are you trying to
tell us something?

563
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,020
Yes, Tano and Maranka are
planning to kill all of you.

564
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:06,724
Also Nargu.

565
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:09,842
You're breaking the Chief's taboo
by coming here, isn't that true?

566
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:10,950
I know it.

567
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:13,560
- And yet you came here to warn us?
- Yes.

568
00:40:14,658 --> 00:40:16,750
How do we know this
isn't some kind of trick?

569
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,963
You do not trust me.

570
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:19,747
I don't blame you.

571
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:23,724
Did Nargu tell you I betrayed
Kimo and caused his death?

572
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:26,259
No, Nargu said nothing about that.

573
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:30,183
They are evil, Tano and
Maranka, both of them.

574
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:32,497
They want to become
gods of the island.

575
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,470
That is why they want
to drive you out,

576
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:37,638
and all others who
stand in their way.

577
00:40:38,071 --> 00:40:40,878
- Are you in their way, as we are?
- Yes

578
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:42,831
They want to kill me, too.

579
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:45,429
Please let me stay here with you.

580
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:47,742
You think we can trust her, Nargu?

581
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:51,098
You can trust Korey.

582
00:40:51,756 --> 00:40:53,226
Even though she lied once,

583
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,272
I think now she tells the truth.

584
00:40:55,424 --> 00:40:57,452
All right, you can stay
here with Orchid.

585
00:40:57,837 --> 00:41:00,447
You'd better get Dori and
stay in the compound too.

586
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:03,705
Monster must be uprooted
and brought here tonight.

587
00:41:10,524 --> 00:41:13,933
Make as little noise as possible.
We don't want to alert the natives.

588
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:16,153
Bill, you dig there.

589
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:19,345
Terry, you and I will sever the
roots as he exposes them.

590
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:20,726
Hold the light, Kid.

591
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:55,604
Pulse beat is almost human.

592
00:41:56,196 --> 00:41:58,224
Maybe we ought to ship
it back to the States.

593
00:41:58,244 --> 00:41:59,764
Makes a great scarecrow.

594
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:02,890
He reminds me of a chemistry
prof I had at med school.

595
00:42:03,576 --> 00:42:07,280
Bill, during the operation, your arm
accidentally brushed the knife in it's heart.

596
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,811
- Ah, I didn't notice.
- I could have sworn it moved.

597
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:12,900
Almost as if it were in pain.

598
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:22,940
The pulse is weak.
It's dying!

599
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:32,383
The pulse is getting weaker!
It's dying on us!

600
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,218
Probably a stoppage in the
circulation somewhere.

601
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:37,049
Maybe a clot in the Aorta.

602
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:39,969
Well, we've done everything we can.
There's nothing more we can do.

603
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,674
Looks as if it will stop beating
altogether in a few minutes.

604
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:46,552
Good! I'm all for throwing it in the
quicksand. Let it return to it's ancestors.

605
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:50,111
Couldn't we try to energize the
adrenal gland with an electrode resistor?

606
00:42:50,298 --> 00:42:51,889
How much energy would you need?

607
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:55,645
I've read of experiments where they
used 750 amps and a 1,000 volts.

608
00:42:55,665 --> 00:42:57,777
Our generators can't give
us that much power.

609
00:42:57,797 --> 00:43:01,026
Look, why keep this
freak of nature alive?

610
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:02,885
Your interest in it is morbid!

611
00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:05,744
Bill, it's purely scientific!

612
00:43:05,764 --> 00:43:07,965
And if you weren't so
concerned with you natives,

613
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,964
and their silly taboos,
you'd be helping us.

614
00:43:09,984 --> 00:43:11,650
Not standing by doing nothing.

615
00:43:11,782 --> 00:43:14,891
I know what, why don't we
psychoanalyze the monster?

616
00:43:15,107 --> 00:43:16,862
Maybe it's mother was
scared by an oak tree.

617
00:43:16,882 --> 00:43:19,267
Oh, Bill. Why won't
you be serious.

618
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:20,621
Look, Terry...

619
00:43:21,325 --> 00:43:23,954
we came down here to treat
people with the plague

620
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:26,714
and those maybe suffering
from atomic fallout.

621
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,132
I'm no tree surgeon.

622
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:31,372
Does this mean you two geniuses
can't figure out the answer?

623
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:32,677
Oh, I've got the answer.

624
00:43:33,222 --> 00:43:36,827
Let's pack our frozen faced friend in
a box and send it back to Dr. Falkner.

625
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:39,390
Maybe he can use it in his
office as a clothes tree.

626
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,442
Case closed!

627
00:43:53,622 --> 00:43:55,845
You two may consider
this case closed,

628
00:43:55,865 --> 00:43:57,986
but this is an entirely
new specie of life,

629
00:43:58,006 --> 00:44:01,161
and as long as there's life in it,
I'm going to work on it.

630
00:44:02,553 --> 00:44:05,914
Formula 447? Is this something
you've been working on at Baku?

631
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:10,267
I've experimented with monkeys and parrots who've
been exposed to a dangerous amount of radiation.

632
00:44:10,287 --> 00:44:14,098
This formula has achieved miraculous
results in re-creating heart action.

633
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:17,314
Have you experimented
with human beings?

634
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:20,732
Afraid I'm years away from
that phase of the work, Bill

635
00:44:21,273 --> 00:44:24,109
Works very slowly. Takes several
hours to show any effect.

636
00:44:25,912 --> 00:44:28,789
I want to try some on
our wooden friend here.

637
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:31,005
I have a few hundred cc's right with me.

638
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,793
What do you think, Bill?

639
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,648
Well, the monsters almost dead.

640
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:39,530
Terry wants to waste her time
on it, it's all right with me.

641
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:42,920
Thanks. Will you help me
with an intravenous injection?

642
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:46,788
You've never experimented with
anything this large before,

643
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:49,277
would you like to check
your calculations?

644
00:44:49,297 --> 00:44:51,045
There isn't time,
the things dying.

645
00:44:51,065 --> 00:44:53,771
We have to trust my calculations.
It's now or never.

646
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,752
All right, all right. We'll do it
just the way you want.

647
00:44:55,772 --> 00:45:00,162
Thank you, Dr. Arnold. Now will hook up
the IV bottle while I mix the formula?

648
00:45:00,182 --> 00:45:01,570
I will be delighted.

649
00:45:08,601 --> 00:45:12,254
Pulse is the same,
no stronger, no weaker.

650
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:17,052
- Bottles almost empty.
- Want me to take the tube out?

651
00:45:18,774 --> 00:45:20,145
Yes, thanks, Bill.

652
00:45:20,638 --> 00:45:23,605
What do we do now, Terry,
sit up with the dying patient?

653
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:26,620
No, I don't think that'll be necessary.

654
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:31,489
My experiments show it requires at least
8 hours for the formula to take affect.

655
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:36,634
Might as well all get a good night's sleep
and meet here at six o'clock in the morning.

656
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:39,728
- That I heartily approve of.
- Six o'clock!

657
00:47:15,596 --> 00:47:17,645
- The monster!
- It's gone!

658
00:47:22,163 --> 00:47:25,243
You must have administered too
large an injection of your formula.

659
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:27,196
Came back to life sooner
than you expected.

660
00:47:27,216 --> 00:47:31,572
The reaction never took less than 8 hours.
I was so sure I figured correctly.

661
00:47:31,592 --> 00:47:33,657
Well, you figured wrong this time, in spades.

662
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:34,783
Wait a minute, doctors.

663
00:47:35,384 --> 00:47:39,816
You honestly believe that Terry's formula
brought the thing back to life and it ran away?

664
00:47:41,394 --> 00:47:42,563
I don't know...

665
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:43,991
Terry,

666
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:46,836
when you re-created heart
action in those monkeys,

667
00:47:46,856 --> 00:47:49,622
did they suddenly have the strength
of gorillas, tear the place apart?

668
00:47:49,642 --> 00:47:53,670
No, it took days or weeks before
they had strength to run around.

669
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,036
Well then, isn't it obvious
who caused this destruction?

670
00:47:56,882 --> 00:47:59,389
You mean, Tano and
the other natives?

671
00:47:59,515 --> 00:48:01,627
You think they came
to get the Tabanga?

672
00:48:01,647 --> 00:48:02,583
I'm afraid so.

673
00:48:02,935 --> 00:48:07,048
And then after they were here, like angry
children, they decided to smash our things.

674
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:10,597
I guess you're right, Professor.

675
00:48:12,325 --> 00:48:13,639
Holy mackerel!

676
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:15,709
You know,

677
00:48:16,536 --> 00:48:18,301
I know this sounds crazy, but

678
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,062
maybe the Tabanga is for real.

679
00:48:22,148 --> 00:48:23,321
And if it is,

680
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:25,096
we're gonna need help.

681
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:27,021
Eddie,

682
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:28,946
radio Baku.

683
00:48:34,718 --> 00:48:36,202
Doc! Professor!

684
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:47,761
Does this mean we're cut off from
communication from the outside?

685
00:50:37,592 --> 00:50:40,324
You've been hiding
from me a long time.

686
00:50:40,344 --> 00:50:42,441
I've been waiting for this chance.

687
00:50:45,026 --> 00:50:48,059
You've stolen my man,
now you must die!

688
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:42,587
Help! Help me!

689
00:52:42,737 --> 00:52:44,097
The Tabanga!

690
00:52:44,117 --> 00:52:45,554
Help me!

691
00:52:45,574 --> 00:52:46,769
Help!

692
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:50,080
Help me!

693
00:52:50,218 --> 00:52:59,941
Help!

694
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:16,897
I just saw the Tabanga!

695
00:53:17,157 --> 00:53:18,865
Well, how do you know
it was Tabanga?

696
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:25,142
Because it looked like a tree, it had eyes and hands
and a knife was still in it's heart, like Kimo's.

697
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:33,831
- You have many loves.
- I'm only calming her fright.

698
00:53:34,452 --> 00:53:36,462
She said she had seen the Tabanga.

699
00:53:38,205 --> 00:53:41,304
- Where did you see it?
- In the forest, near the quicksand.

700
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:43,952
- You sure it was the Tabanga?
- I swear it!

701
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:45,501
We'll soon find out.

702
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,337
We will go to the cemetery!

703
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:12,319
This is dangerous.
The Tabanga's been taken out.

704
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:15,812
It was the Americans! They cut
the roots to free the Tabanga!

705
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:19,230
- It will kill us all!
- Not if we kill it first.

706
00:54:20,206 --> 00:54:22,544
We'll have our bravest men
hunt it down and kill it!

707
00:54:22,564 --> 00:54:25,108
As long as the Tabanga's free,
we are all in danger.

708
00:54:25,803 --> 00:54:28,761
After the Tabanga dies, then
the Americans die!

709
00:54:29,695 --> 00:54:31,629
Come, take me to where
you saw the Tabanga.

710
00:54:50,336 --> 00:54:51,525
Korey's gone!

711
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:53,153
This is where I left her!

712
00:54:53,303 --> 00:54:54,890
See, there's her knife!

713
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,706
See, this is Korey's too!

714
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,482
Tabanga must have thrown
Korey in the quicksand.

715
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:11,491
We must find the Tabanga!

716
00:56:22,807 --> 00:56:25,408
- Where's Maranka?
- Killed, by the Tabanga.

717
00:56:25,428 --> 00:56:28,365
Tano, why didn't you destroy
the Tabanga with medicine?

718
00:56:30,202 --> 00:56:33,306
Before I could get to it, the Americans
had cut the roots and given it freedom.

719
00:56:33,906 --> 00:56:36,991
Now the evil spirits in the Tabanga
are too strong, it must be killed!

720
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,240
Hurry, we have no time to waste!

721
00:56:47,043 --> 00:56:48,357
Orchid, what's wrong?

722
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:51,700
I just came from the village.
The Tabanga is not dead.

723
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,770
That can't be!

724
00:56:53,136 --> 00:56:55,812
Tabanga came to the village
and killed Maranka.

725
00:56:57,112 --> 00:56:58,915
Does anybody know the
Tabanga is now?

726
00:56:58,935 --> 00:57:00,981
Tano and his men
are looking for it.

727
00:57:05,394 --> 00:57:06,305
What is it?

728
00:57:08,356 --> 00:57:09,858
The monster's still alive.

729
00:57:10,776 --> 00:57:14,550
I knew my formula would work.
I was right, Professor, wasn't I?

730
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,302
Yes, but I'm not sure how right
I was to let you go ahead with it.

731
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:19,802
Orchid reports the
Tabanga's killed the chief.

732
00:57:19,822 --> 00:57:20,950
Oh no, I...

733
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:23,702
I just wanted it to live.

734
00:57:24,448 --> 00:57:25,669
Not to destroy.

735
00:57:26,054 --> 00:57:27,575
Don't blame yourself, Terry.

736
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:31,317
The radiation dormant in the monster
must have set off a chain reaction.

737
00:57:31,577 --> 00:57:34,528
We've got to stop that monster
before there's any more killing!

738
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:39,325
Isn't it strange, that of all the natives
on the island, the monster got Maranka?

739
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:41,925
Tabanka spirit of revenge.

740
00:57:42,113 --> 00:57:44,247
It killed Korey, Kimo's widow.

741
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:47,167
We've got to help these people.

742
00:57:47,427 --> 00:57:49,287
It is dangerous for you to go.

743
00:57:49,643 --> 00:57:52,357
Tano blames you for taking
the Tabanga from the ground.

744
00:57:52,545 --> 00:57:56,352
Orchid's right. With the Tabanga running
amok, they'll kill anything in sight.

745
00:57:57,967 --> 00:58:00,676
- Are the guns loaded?
- Yeah.

746
00:58:18,296 --> 00:58:20,611
Kani, we've set our trap well.

747
00:58:21,484 --> 00:58:24,283
Now we must be certain the
Tabanga will fall into this pit.

748
00:58:24,537 --> 00:58:26,987
We know the Tabanga
has threatened three lives,

749
00:58:27,335 --> 00:58:30,142
Korey's, Maranka's, and mine.

750
00:58:30,963 --> 00:58:32,841
So I am the next one
he would kill!

751
00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:35,860
Therefore, I'm the bait that
must lead him to the trap!

752
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:40,132
Maku, climb a tree, signal me when
you see it coming. I'll stand here.

753
00:58:40,152 --> 00:58:41,770
The rest of you,
stand behind the trees!

754
00:59:20,345 --> 00:59:23,068
Tabanga comes!
Tabanga comes!

755
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:22,775
Now!

756
01:00:49,988 --> 01:00:51,406
Tabanga will die.

757
01:02:03,362 --> 01:02:05,399
Wait a minute, Doc.
This may be trouble.

758
01:02:05,963 --> 01:02:06,742
Eddie!

759
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:10,887
See who's at the door.
Be ready to shoot.

760
01:02:11,023 --> 01:02:12,053
Yes, sir.

761
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,354
Well, what do you want?

762
01:02:16,374 --> 01:02:18,318
Come quick, please help us.

763
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:20,026
We can not kill the Tabanga.

764
01:02:20,046 --> 01:02:21,228
We burned Tabanga

765
01:02:21,248 --> 01:02:22,524
with a mighty fire,

766
01:02:22,628 --> 01:02:23,614
but it didn't help.

767
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:24,938
It came out alive!

768
01:02:25,022 --> 01:02:27,032
Please come before it kills us all!

769
01:02:27,052 --> 01:02:28,718
Do you know where the
Tabanga is now?

770
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,366
Good. You two wait outside.

771
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,807
Thank heavens all
of you are alive.

772
01:02:51,827 --> 01:02:53,480
I thought I'd never
see you again.

773
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,155
When Orchid told me about that
horrible monster running amok,

774
01:02:56,175 --> 01:02:57,602
I didn't dare leave my house.

775
01:02:57,622 --> 01:02:59,842
An hour ago the natives
ran past the house

776
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:02,338
screaming and jabbering
about the monster.

777
01:03:02,358 --> 01:03:04,846
They said it was on the prowl.

778
01:03:05,236 --> 01:03:07,114
You two girls stay here.
It's safer.

779
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:08,916
Oh, no. I'm going with you.

780
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:12,025
I won't stay here alone for
minute with you men gone.

781
01:03:12,045 --> 01:03:13,993
What if that horrible thing came back.

782
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:15,353
She's right.

783
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:18,026
Obviously, locked doors mean
nothing to the monster.

784
01:03:18,046 --> 01:03:20,749
Well, I can't keep you back
if you insist on tagging along.

785
01:03:21,575 --> 01:03:23,161
Bring a gun for me, Eddie.

786
01:03:24,363 --> 01:03:26,605
I don't know how to shoot
one of the bloomin' things,

787
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:29,000
but I'd feel safer
with one also.

788
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,222
Make it two, Eddie.

789
01:04:15,404 --> 01:04:18,751
Eddie, we should be able to pick up the
trail if we can find any of that green ooze.

790
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,563
I'll keep my eyes open, Doc.

791
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:21,824
[Mrs. Kilgore talking about
her former husbands....]

792
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,380
And I've looked for that
green goop everywhere,

793
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,192
everywhere I can think,

794
01:05:46,212 --> 01:05:48,311
and I haven't seen a sign of it.

795
01:05:48,884 --> 01:05:51,230
I never would have thought
of such a thing from Kimo.

796
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:53,486
Delightful fellow, really.

797
01:05:53,506 --> 01:05:55,109
I know that you
like the Doc, Deary,

798
01:05:55,129 --> 01:05:59,233
but I had a real liking for that Kimo,
and I had a thing going once.

799
01:05:59,253 --> 01:06:01,194
Of course, he was much taller than I,

800
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:03,031
but there's something about a tall man that I,

801
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:06,310
well I don't know, you look up at him
and he looks down at you,

802
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:09,801
and I don't know, you just go
on like that indefinitely.

803
01:06:21,527 --> 01:06:25,912
Deary, island life is very pleasant,
but there's nothing like a good pub.

804
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:28,891
There you sit with a gentleman
every evening, drinking...

805
01:06:33,175 --> 01:06:35,501
Help! Help!

806
01:06:35,828 --> 01:06:37,724
Help! Help!

807
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:39,889
- What was that?
- It came from behind us.

808
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:41,397
Help!

809
01:06:45,053 --> 01:06:45,888
Where's Terry?

810
01:06:45,908 --> 01:06:49,429
I don't know. I was talking to her and
all of a sudden, poof, she disappeared.

811
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:51,781
You think that bloomin'
monster got hold of her?

812
01:06:51,801 --> 01:06:54,223
- We've got to find her.
- Let's go back. Come on!

813
01:07:41,332 --> 01:07:42,346
Down there!

814
01:07:58,295 --> 01:07:59,347
It's Terry!

815
01:08:03,771 --> 01:08:04,868
You're the best shot, Eddie.

816
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:06,352
Have you got enough
light to see?

817
01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:07,780
This moonlight's good enough.

818
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,391
Aye.

819
01:08:10,762 --> 01:08:11,927
Try for that knife.

820
01:08:12,471 --> 01:08:15,626
Maybe if you can hit that knife with the bullet
it'll drive it clear through the monster's heart.

821
01:08:26,775 --> 01:08:28,962
It has to turn to give me a
crack at that knife, Doc.

822
01:08:28,982 --> 01:08:31,009
Fire a few shots,
maybe it'll turn around.

823
01:08:36,072 --> 01:08:37,377
No effect on it at all.

824
01:08:38,176 --> 01:08:40,147
- Try again.
- I'll aim above her.

825
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:45,010
Doc, I never saw
anything like this.

826
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:47,683
Those bullets bounce off like
BB shot on a stone wall.

827
01:08:47,703 --> 01:08:49,546
That knife's our only chance.

828
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:03,637
Now!

829
01:09:51,056 --> 01:09:53,529
We know now,
American magic is better.

830
01:09:53,642 --> 01:09:56,121
Maybe we need new medicine
maker to replace Tano.

831
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,375
Will you be our witch doctor?

832
01:09:58,844 --> 01:10:02,365
Maybe for a little while, Maku. Then perhaps
we can teach some of your people.

833
01:10:02,563 --> 01:10:03,319
Thank you.

834
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:07,010
Oh, Professor Clark,
that was ever so thrilling.

835
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:10,614
And isn't nice you and the
natives can be friends again.

836
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:24,394
Yes, it looks like a honeymoon and
back to the States for them.

837
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:28,348
Ah, by the way, Professor,

838
01:10:28,368 --> 01:10:30,395
I never asked you,

839
01:10:30,415 --> 01:10:32,058
are you married?
