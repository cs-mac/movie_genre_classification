1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,090
Wait...

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,690
By using...

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,570
words?

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,100
King...

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,410
Would you like to know your name?

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,620
How would you know my name?

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,800
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,010
She uttered your name
with her dying breath.

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,340
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.

10
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,380
Interested in fighting me now?

11
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,720
If you can force me to admit defeat,

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,240
I will tell you your name.

13
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,310
Force you to admit defeat
without killing you?

14
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,060
So, similar to a bishop
and rook handicap...

15
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,770
No matter.

16
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,040
I shall checkmate you shortly.

17
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:18,682
Centipede x And x Memory

18
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:30,722
As the King and Netero prepared
for their final battle...

19
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:02,732
Beneath the palace,
Ikalgo was still sobbing,

20
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:07,662
having failed to finish off
the unconscious Brovada.

21
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:58,732
Fire! This is the best option!

22
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:02,882
There's no one else to help me!

23
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:05,292
I h-have to...

24
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:08,542
kill him!

25
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,302
This is no time to be crying...

26
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:19,382
I have to find Palm!

27
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,512
Huh?

28
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:24,072
The door to the warehouse area is open.

29
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:27,272
So is the door leading to the garage!

30
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,852
Why?

31
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,232
Don't move!

32
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:36,532
If you move, I'll attack.

33
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:42,282
Welfin...

34
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:46,542
I have a lot of things to ask you.

35
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,542
If you seem to be trying anything funny,

36
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:50,132
I'll kill you!

37
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:54,142
What he wants to ask me

38
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:55,752
is obvious!

39
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:58,152
The number of my allies,

40
00:04:58,602 --> 00:04:59,662
their roles,

41
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:01,802
and their abilities.

42
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:06,062
And he intends to use any means
necessary to get the answers.

43
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:11,192
People could die if I leak information.

44
00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:14,052
If he's a Manipulator,

45
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:17,482
he can obtain the information
against my will.

46
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:21,282
Huh?

47
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:22,952
D-Don't move!

48
00:05:22,952 --> 00:05:24,202
I really will kill you!

49
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:26,122
Go ahead... Kill me.

50
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:26,952
That's what I want!

51
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,452
Stop!

52
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,462
If the alternative is betraying my buddies,

53
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:31,912
I'll take you with me!

54
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,272
Ouch!

55
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,592
Bastard! Now you've done it!

56
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,592
Damn it!

57
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:40,062
I'll kill you!

58
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,462
Missile Man!

59
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,232
I'm... not dead...

60
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:53,632
I didn't sustain any damage.

61
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:56,652
What was that attack?

62
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:59,902
Damn, that hurts...

63
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:02,122
You little punk...

64
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:04,662
Damn...

65
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:10,912
That bastard... How did a wimp like
that figure out my weakness?

66
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:14,322
Missile Man requires questions
and answers to work.

67
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:18,562
If an enemy attacks before I can ask
a question, it's null and void!

68
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:20,812
The wound isn't deep...

69
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:26,232
I'll take my time beating him to a pulp.

70
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:33,552
Huh?

71
00:06:44,172 --> 00:06:47,452
He planted something inside me?

72
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:53,532
Those were created by my Nen

73
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:55,332
They're black centipedes.

74
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:58,332
Black Centipede

75
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,842
They grow by feeding on your resistance.

76
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:15,152
If you disobey my orders or try to hurt me,

77
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:18,612
you'll suffer excruciating pain,

78
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:22,272
then they'll tear your
body apart and you'll die!

79
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,652
Wh-What are you doing, fool?

80
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:35,602
Weren't you listening to me?

81
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:38,942
If you try to do that...

82
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:49,492
That's fine with me.

83
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:52,802
If my life is all it takes, I'll give it!

84
00:07:57,742 --> 00:07:59,272
S-Stop!

85
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:08,532
No, wait...

86
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:13,562
If he wanted to kill me, that's the
ultimate form of resistance.

87
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:19,552
Now, it'll take no time for the black centipedes
to grow large enough to kill him instantly!

88
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:27,962
Don't worry.

89
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:29,962
I'm not interested in killing you...

90
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:34,192
I just need to make sure
that you can't leave.

91
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,182
I still...

92
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,812
have plenty of bullets.

93
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:45,572
Bastard! Don't mess with me!

94
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,322
I'll kill you!

95
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:49,722
You're dead! I'll kill you!!

96
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:16,412
It's so easy.

97
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,362
When I'm prepared to offer my own life,

98
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:30,182
it's so easy to pull the trigger.

99
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:12,702
I g-get it...

100
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:13,782
I get it, already.

101
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,242
I won't go anywhere!

102
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,962
I surrender.

103
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:21,002
Please... Don't fire!

104
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:27,142
The pain is going away.

105
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:29,272
The creatures inside me are suffering?

106
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,512
I lose, damn it...

107
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:36,012
I can't move anymore.

108
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:40,612
Is it because Welfin admitted defeat?

109
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:48,462
Man, I knew it...

110
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,482
I had a feeling this
would happen eventually.

111
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:55,052
But still...

112
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:58,442
I didn't think I was this weak!

113
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:02,182
I didn't think it'd be so scary
to face someone who fights

114
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:04,672
with no regard for their own life!

115
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:07,012
Hey.

116
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:08,322
What?

117
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:13,552
The pain has stopped, but can
you get rid of these bugs?

118
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,502
Stop complaining...

119
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:19,672
I'm in too much pain to
think about that now!

120
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:28,042
Hurry up.

121
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:30,572
Give me a minute!

122
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:35,692
I don't have a way to
deactivate Missile Man.

123
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:39,752
But if I tell the truth,
I'm in real trouble...

124
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,832
Damn, how do I get out of this?

125
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:48,182
I need to buy time...

126
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:51,002
Until I can come up with a good idea.

127
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:57,532
The pain is making me...

128
00:11:58,102 --> 00:12:00,552
feel faint...

129
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:23,072
Wait! Okay!

130
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:25,172
I was lying! I won't do it again!

131
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:27,242
Then get rid of these.

132
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:29,602
Yeah, uh...

133
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:32,132
So, the thing is...

134
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:40,972
Forget it. I see how it is.

135
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,012
Wait! Hold on!

136
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:45,602
I can't remove them!

137
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:47,272
Not once they've been activated!

138
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:53,192
That's why I didn't want to say anything.

139
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,712
It's the truth! Believe me!

140
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,532
I'm not trying to trick you!

141
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:02,142
The insects are in pain again.

142
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:05,082
Maybe because Welfin is telling the truth?

143
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:07,492
Can you really blame me?

144
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:11,732
I only use this attack when
I want to kill someone.

145
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,542
I never cared what happened after that.



146
00:13:14,222 --> 00:13:19,052
I never gave any thought to
what happened to my enemy.

147
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:23,382
Nen abilities are really something.

148
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:27,312
My abilities reflect my own personality.

149
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:32,462
My personality? His true intentions?

150
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:34,922
Welfin...

151
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:39,272
What do I ask him?

152
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:41,502
What do I want to know?

153
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:48,172
I once knew someone just like him.

154
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:53,792
Do you have any memories from
when you were human?

155
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:57,302
Wh-Why are you asking about that?

156
00:13:57,842 --> 00:13:59,492
I can't remember...

157
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:04,852
You're lying.

158
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,172
Wh-What?

159
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:08,942
Stop! Hold on!

160
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:09,732
Calm down!

161
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:14,412
If you don't tell me the
truth, I'll shoot you.

162
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,142
When I woke up,

163
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:30,222
my first thought was...

164
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:37,602
Damn...

165
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:41,302
I can still remember it.

166
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:55,462
I'm sure those monster
bugs killed me in NGL.

167
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:11,482
I was fed to the Queen,
and reborn as something new...

168
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:16,542
But I still...

169
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:22,672
I still remember the one thing
I most wanted to forget.
170
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,982
The sight of my father strangling me,

171
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:33,742
and the woman watching behind him.

172
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:42,202
At first, I only had flashbacks of it.

173
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:46,072
Over time, I remembered the
entire sequence of events.

174
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:52,832
I was saved by...

175
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:56,692
my little brother, who
was unrelated by blood.

176
00:16:00,532 --> 00:16:01,842
I remember now!


177
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:05,962
He looked just like Gyro!

178
00:16:07,262 --> 00:16:08,232
Gyro?

179
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:11,222
You know. The king!

180
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:18,302
We used to brag about whose
life was more miserable.

181
00:16:19,832 --> 00:16:23,512
He was the only one I could
turn to when I needed

182
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:25,242
to laugh away my tears...

183
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:29,512
We were both empty.

184
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:34,172
So we had nothing to hide.

185
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:43,432
I wonder what he's doing now...

186
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:57,272
I want to see him one more time...

187
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:22,262
Yes, I just want to see Gyro.

188
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:26,952
I'm tired of dealing with Ants and humans,

189
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:31,432
with money and nations...



190
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:36,902
Go.

191
00:17:37,612 --> 00:17:39,242
The bugs are gone.

192
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:42,312
You still have something to do.

193
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:48,322
Why did you open the doors?

194
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:55,082
Oh, I was letting those weaklings
reach the treasure in the back.

195
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,302
They can't put up much of a fight.

196
00:18:02,532 --> 00:18:05,012
I was watching you and Bro on the monitor.

197
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:09,592
And I told them to pass while
you were on the way back.

198
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,332
A coward!

199
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:25,982
It was that simple.

200
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:31,612
Once I saw that you couldn't finish Bro,

201
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:34,622
I thought
you'd be an easy target.

202
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,592
I couldn't have been more wrong.

203
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:44,842
Go on.

204
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:46,962
I'm too tired to move...

205
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:49,122
I have one last question.

206
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,632
Did you see a woman in the palace?

207
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:55,122
A woman?

208
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:59,052
Not sure if it's the one
you're talking about,

209
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:03,542
but the Royal Guard captured a human,
and put her in a cocoon.

210
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,652
Where is she?

211
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:09,112
Take the elevator up, then turn left.

212
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:11,152
It's the room at the end of the hall.

213
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:14,392
They called it ?1.

214
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:16,822
Thank you!

215
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:22,662
What's so funny?

216
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:29,922
Telling the truth

217
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:33,632
feels really good...

218
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:43,692
Welfin had spent his life unable
to trust himself or others.

219
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:49,522
Telling Ikalgo the location of
the one he searched for

220
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:54,652
was the first time he'd opened
up and spoken honestly.


221
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:55,644
Next time: Breakdown x And x Awakening.

222
00:20:57,054 --> 00:20:59,774
I'm just... I'm just...

223
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:01,474
What's wrong, Killua?

224
00:21:01,474 --> 00:21:05,140
I'm here for you.
