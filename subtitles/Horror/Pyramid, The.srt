1
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:17,363
What's going on? Are you getting this?

2
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:19,832
What's he doing? What's he doing?

3
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,784
- Do you think they'll let us pass?
- It doesn't look like it.

4
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,327
- Are you good to go?
- Yeah, rolling.

5
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:30,559
Hidden within this sprawling desert,
250 Miles South of Cairo,

6
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,921
the public will soon lay their eyes
on the Holdens' groundbreaking research,

7
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,859
and the father-daughter team
could rewrite history as we know it.

8
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,071
As you can see, the pyramid behind me
has only three sides,

9
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:45,307
not four like the giza pyramids.

10
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:49,686
This architectural feat singles it out
as an exception in this region.

11
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:53,006
You're gonna have to start over. The barking
is covering everything you're saying.

12
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,584
Damn it. What's wrong with those dogs?

13
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:59,274
Whose are they, anyway?
They're just feral dogs running around.

14
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:03,759
Can someone get a shotgun or something
and get rid of these dogs, please?

15
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:06,695
Driving me crazy.
All right, let's go again.

16
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:10,348
Okay, Sunni. Whenever you're ready,
we're good to go.

17
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:13,235
Okay. The way this works is,
I'll ask you a question,

18
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:15,379
you try to incorporate the question
into your response.

19
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,089
Like if I ask you your name,
you would say...

20
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,424
- Dr. Miles Holden.
- Wrong.

21
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:23,679
- Right. My name is Dr. Miles Holden.
- That's what I'm talking about.

22
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,889
Could you tell us
what exactly you're looking for?

23
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,560
Yeah. There are certain ancient texts
which refer to this geographic area

24
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,215
as the possible site of the lost pyramid
of Akhenaten which may be related

25
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,553
to the particular and unusual
three-sided architecture of our pyramid.

26
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:43,031
- I just need to quickly check your mic.
- Yeah. It's a little windy out here.

27
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:45,759
It's a great shot.
Just don't step backwards.

28
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,078
Yeah, okay. You tell me when.

29
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:50,938
Pyramids. Hit me with it.

30
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,393
Action.

31
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:58,380
Whatever we're looking at, this is not
the pyramid of king Akhenaten.

32
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,633
The structure that we're dealing with
is buried below the surface.

33
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,469
It takes millennia
for sand to build up that high.

34
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:10,100
Which means that this structure predates
the reign of Akhenaten by generations.

35
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,286
Why are so many people
against the satellites?

36
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:17,983
Most archaeologists are trapped in time
when it comes to reworking methodologies,

37
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:22,195
and assimilating new evidence
into existing historical frameworks.

38
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,800
Proving an older genealogy
for Egyptian history basically means

39
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,054
throwing everything they have been
working on their entire lives into question.

40
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:33,140
Isn't that what you're trying to do?

41
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,667
No, not exactly.

42
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:38,253
See, I respect the work
that they have done,

43
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:40,859
but we just need to know
when it's time to innovate.

44
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:57,627
Most of our pyramid is buried deep
beneath the desert. Here is a scan.

45
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:04,749
Look at the size of that thing!
That's got to be 600 feet on each side.

46
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,616
See this tunnel here?
This is our way in.

47
00:05:07,716 --> 00:05:09,493
It leads directly
to the apex of the pyramid.

48
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:11,812
- The apex?
- It's the tip of the pyramid.

49
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,456
Pyramids don't normally have
apexes at the entrance.

50
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:16,541
- But this one does.
- Who dug the tunnel?

51
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:18,986
We don't know yet.
That's also part of our discovery.

52
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,563
Nora, tell me about the satellites.

53
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:24,883
Well, I'm not the first archaeologist
to break ground using satellite technology.

54
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:28,728
But I was inspired to apply it
after an article that I read about SETI

55
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,372
- out of new Mexico.
- SETI?

56
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:34,393
"Search for extraterrestrial intelligence."
They were using the satellites

57
00:05:34,493 --> 00:05:36,945
to search for traces of water
underneath the surface of Mars.

58
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,398
I thought we were here
to talk about Egypt, not aliens.

59
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:42,526
What do you think about all those theories?
About aliens coming to earth?

60
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:45,237
And that the pyramids
are just giant transmitters?

61
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:48,337
Well, come on. Even I have my limits.

62
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:52,828
Do you see these... how these ridges form
a barrier around the pyramid? You just...

63
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:57,268
Dad. Dad. Could you please stop touching
buttons that you don't understand?

64
00:05:57,368 --> 00:06:00,127
So... where was that taken?

65
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,963
- It doesn't matter when it was taken.
- I said where.

66
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:07,092
This technology, the satellite stuff
is such a small part of what we're doing.

67
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:11,013
We should be talking about archaeology,
about the pyramid, about Akhenaten, and...

68
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:15,100
Actually, the whole satellite angle is what
interested the network in the first place.

69
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,688
It's the dawn of a new age in archaeology.
Using the future to understand the past.

70
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:22,274
Anything else I'm not supposed to see?

71
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:24,626
Would you just mind your own business?
Thank you very much.

72
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:27,527
I'm sorry. You are my business, all right?
You are my business.

73
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:32,534
Archaeology used to be
about digs and dirt.

74
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:36,474
But we've lost the raw sensation
with all this technological mediation.

75
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:38,138
Great.

76
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,293
- How was that, Fitz?
- It was award-winning.

77
00:06:41,393 --> 00:06:45,103
Okay. Let's wrap up.
We're done for the day.

78
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,573
Sorry.

79
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,890
Hey.

80
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:11,967
No, I'm fine, mom.
I'm fine. Don't worry. Okay.

81
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:15,429
Cairo is far, far away. And we're supposed
to break through tomorrow.

82
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,516
So if we get far enough, we'll be safer
underground than we will be in a war bunker.

83
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:22,853
No, I'm not taking it lightly.
I'm just trying to focus on my work.

84
00:08:22,953 --> 00:08:27,190
Could you please not worry?
You know dad is enough to handle as it is.

85
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,257
Okay. I love you, too. I do.
All right, tell...

86
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:36,825
You know what? Mom, I have to go.
I'll call you tomorrow. I love you. Bye.

87
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:40,245
Zahir, get your metallic junk
out of here.

88
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:58,490
Jesus! What the hell is that?

89
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:08,941
Allow me to introduce you to Shorty.

90
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,068
He's gonna be our first
set of eyes and ears inside

91
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,278
after we make initial breakthrough.

92
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:15,472
He stands just over one foot tall

93
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:18,575
with six wheels
on a rocker-bogie suspension system

94
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:21,620
which was originally designed by NASA
for their Mars rovers

95
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,830
to allow them to travel
over the rough martian terrain.

96
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,770
I bet this thing is a real babe magnet.

97
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,877
Some of the missions Shorty
has been on are...

98
00:09:28,977 --> 00:09:33,340
Michael Zahir, our robotics engineer.
But it seems he wasn't briefed

99
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,551
on which million-dollar territories
he would be exploring.

100
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:39,763
Don't you worry, Nora.
I've got two primary camera feeds

101
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:43,825
sending back real-time footage
to our command center. So...

102
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:48,994
everything Shorty sees is permanently
recorded. Right, partner?

103
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:53,068
- Look out.
- Yeah. Cute.

104
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:54,958
Look out.

105
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:17,050
We're not shooting Days Of Our Lives.
Stop wasting your memory space.

106
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,740
Come on. People would love to see
these two nerds get freaky.

107
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,734
- Dr. Holden! Dr. Holden!
- Wait, what's he saying?

108
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:37,821
- We break through! We break through!
- What? Come on! Come on!

109
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:39,114
Are you all right? Give me your hand.

110
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:40,407
- You got it?
- Yeah.

111
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,285
- Slow down, slow down.
- You coming?

112
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:45,621
Tell them not to open it up yet.
Tell them to hold off.

113
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:49,667
- Yeah, hold off!
- Zahir, I need you to translate.

114
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:55,155
You got it? You got it?

115
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,075
Here it comes.

116
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,611
Jesus!

117
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,761
Get him out of here!

118
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,645
We have to get him to medical!

119
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:31,854
Oh, my God. We have to do something!

120
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:51,103
- He's alive.
- Thank God.

121
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:52,813
- So what happened to him?
- Aspergillus.

122
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,732
- What's aspergillus?
- Inhalation of toxic air.

123
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,651
It's actually not as uncommon
as it sounds.

124
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:01,363
- What causes it?
- A fungi usually found in caves and tombs,

125
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:03,673
structures that have been sealed off.

126
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,618
This pyramid could be way older
than even I had originally thought.

127
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:09,037
Nora, please. Stop spinning out
your wild theories.

128
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm trying to reassure the university that
we're going to be doing things on schedule.

129
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,600
And that has to be turned off.

130
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,172
Nobody goes near that pyramid
without my permission, all right?

131
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,925
And nobody mentions
the word "curse." Understood?

132
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:25,220
I don't want any of that crazy
nonsense on my site.

133
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,055
Our site.

134
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:30,095
Goddamn sand.

135
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,990
What?

136
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:35,971
What?

137
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:38,848
What's wrong?

138
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:41,915
What's wrong?

139
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:48,427
You can't shut us down.
We're about to launch Shorty.

140
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:50,329
<i>Look, it's not us, it's the government.</i>

141
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,348
<i>The ministry of antiquities is ordering
all research teams in the area</i>

142
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:55,542
<i>to pull out immediately.</i>

143
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,128
<i>They want you cleared out in 24 hours.</i>

144
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:00,881
When will we be able
to resume the excavation?

145
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,549
<i>We don't know yet.</i>

146
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,968
I'm sorry, what? I don't understand.

147
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,762
<i>You've been in the desert too long.</i>

148
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:10,307
<i>You should see what's happening
in the streets of Cairo. It's mayhem.</i>

149
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:13,977
<i>Wide-scale violence
between the military and the protestors.</i>

150
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:15,270
<i>They're fearing a civil war.</i>

151
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,281
- But this isn't Cairo.
- Yeah, we are in the middle of the desert.

152
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:23,278
<i>You don't get it. I'm sorry, Miles,
but you have to be out by tomorrow morning.</i>

153
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:26,018
God. We are so close!

154
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,577
There goes my emmy.

155
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:35,127
Nora. Nora, this is not a discussion.
The final answer is no. Thank you.

156
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,335
Would you please hand these out
to everybody you see around here?

157
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:41,388
This place needs to look like
we were never here by morning.

158
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,598
What is going on?

159
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,527
It's all written down there. This is not
a conference. Now just go, please.

160
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:51,640
- So, that's it? That's it?
- And what would you like me to do?

161
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,643
How about anything?
You barely put up a fight.

162
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:57,271
I don't fight battles
I can't win, alright?

163
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,231
I have got a career to think of,
and so do you.

164
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:01,821
- Don't forget that!
- Okay.

165
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:04,503
But we can't walk away from here
with nothing to show.

166
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:05,570
I am not...

167
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,824
Dad, please!
This is the find of the century.

168
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:11,868
And you're going to give up
when we are this close.

169
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:14,370
We owe this to our name.

170
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,040
- What's the harm?
- Besides toxic air poisoning?

171
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,169
We won't go in ourselves, okay?
We'll just send in Shorty.

172
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:24,172
He can take some readings
and some pictures.

173
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:29,034
A couple of hours.
Nobody will even know that we were gone.

174
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:33,598
Dad, I know what you're thinking.

175
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:36,192
Look me in the eye and tell me
that you don't wanna see

176
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,610
what's going on in that pyramid.

177
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:43,458
Trust me.

178
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:51,511
- Got it?
- Yeah.

179
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:54,673
Yes!

180
00:14:55,971 --> 00:15:00,626
Guys, captain Egypt is following you,
and he doesn't look happy.

181
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:04,426
Hold on. Hold on.
Let me talk to him real quick.

182
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:17,267
Zahir, what is he saying?

183
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,312
He's saying that... he's wondering
why we still have our stuff here.

184
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:23,273
He's here to supervise us,
make sure we get on the plane tomorrow.

185
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,651
Tell him not to worry,
that we are wrapping things up,

186
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:29,287
- that everything is on schedule.
- Dad, what the hell?

187
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:33,024
Fine, fine.

188
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,137
How does the air check out?

189
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:56,473
No. Don't even think about it, Nora.
There's no way you're going in there.

190
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:59,851
Actually, according to the meters,
it's showing minimal traces of toxic fumes,

191
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,621
but definitely below dangerous levels.

192
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:05,561
But I'm assuming it's because
we're still close to the entrance.

193
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,232
- Can you enhance that?
- Can you get out of my workspace, please?

194
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:24,167
It's a $3 million rover.
Yeah, I can enhance it.

195
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,086
Zoom in. Zoom in right there.
Make that larger. Zoom in.

196
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,146
- Dad, please.
- What?

197
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,851
That. This says "slaughter."
This says "God."

198
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:43,954
- Yeah, this one says "underworld."
- What? Really?

199
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:48,694
Relax, Fitzie, these are just symbols
to scare away grave robbers.

200
00:17:08,645 --> 00:17:10,113
Curved stick. Staff.

201
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:12,966
- What the hell is that?
- That, my dear, is the symbol of Osiris.

202
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,635
- Osiris?
- He's the God of the afterlife.

203
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:17,075
He's also considered by the Egyptians
as the first pharaoh.

204
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:38,116
Oh, God. Okay, what was that?

205
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,787
It must've been a dog. Got in somehow.

206
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,564
They left the opening unguarded.
Let's just keep our wits sharp, all right?

207
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,650
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

208
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,328
You guys hear that?

209
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:29,543
I've lost all external control.
Both the camera feeds.

210
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,628
- Hold on, hold on. Damn dogs.
- You mean...

211
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,598
Hold on.

212
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,475
Shorty's offline. I got to go get him.

213
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:42,039
No. You are not going in there.
We have no idea what's in there.

214
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:44,808
Could be fumes still.
No. Be realistic, Zahir.

215
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,561
Be realistic? I just told you
how much that rover costs, okay?

216
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:49,313
It's on loan.
Does he not know how this works?

217
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:51,648
We can't even be here.
We have to be on a plane.

218
00:18:51,748 --> 00:18:55,218
And you don't think NASA's gonna be pissed
to find out we lost their rover?

219
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:01,533
- Okay, okay. But just the two of us.
- No. That is not happening.

220
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,077
Okay, we have no idea if we're
gonna be able to come back here.

221
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:05,996
You're crazy if you think
I'm not going in there with you.

222
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:09,166
The camera goes everywhere you do.
You agreed to that back in the U.S.

223
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:11,601
Actually, I'm all right to just hang
back here. You guys can go...

224
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,184
- Get your ass in there.
- Okay.

225
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:16,118
Hope you brought those extra batteries.
We're gonna need them.

226
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:22,012
I thought we were the only ones filming.

227
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:24,823
It's my version of a notebook.
I don't want to miss anything.

228
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:28,279
- You ready?
- Yeah, we're coming. Let's go.

229
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,856
So, how are we supposed
to get Shorty out, if it doesn't work?

230
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:35,859
- I'll figure it out.
- Yeah, he doesn't know either.

231
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:39,229
So, I think these flares might help us
take care of our stray dog problem.

232
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,499
He's saying we can't go in there.

233
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,354
Keep rolling!

234
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:52,681
- Tell him to calm down!
- I'm trying.

235
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,335
Let me... let me try to talk to him.

236
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,997
- What are they saying?
- I can't get it, they're going too fast.

237
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:15,329
He's making a plea of some kind.
From one Egyptian to another.

238
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:19,581
I think it's working.

239
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:36,904
All right, guys,
we've got two hours to get Shorty.

240
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,171
Here you go.

241
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:46,638
What's that for?

242
00:20:46,738 --> 00:20:48,949
It's just something to help us
find our way back.

243
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,635
You know, in case we decide
to go in a little further.

244
00:20:51,735 --> 00:20:53,595
Further?

245
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,391
Great.

246
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:58,942
They don't seriously expect us
to wear these, do they?

247
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,412
Yeah, guess so.

248
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:04,202
Come on, guys, let's go.

249
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,525
Watch your step.

250
00:21:12,222 --> 00:21:14,625
The structure could collapse
at any moment.

251
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:17,561
And don't touch anything. Stay close.

252
00:21:17,661 --> 00:21:23,685
Imagine, the last people who walked
these tunnels died thousands of years ago.

253
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:53,584
Also, the ancient Egyptians only stood
about five feet tall so watch your heads.

254
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:56,382
It's a little taller in here.

255
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:10,898
The dogs couldn't have
dragged him too far.

256
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,864
I don't get it. There's no tracks.
He couldn't have just disappeared.

257
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:48,429
Guys... Which way do we go now?

258
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:54,933
- No, no!
- Michael, what's wrong?

259
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:57,243
Oh, God.

260
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:00,159
I'm dead. I'm dead.

261
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,602
- NASA's gonna be pissed.
- I'm dead.

262
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:08,447
I'm dead. I'm freaking dead!

263
00:23:08,547 --> 00:23:11,067
Death. Amazing.

264
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:15,287
Well, chin up, mate.
I'm sure we can find the rest of him.

265
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:17,347
We're gonna find him.

266
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:21,297
Hey, doc. Is this the apex thing
you were talking about?

267
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,175
There's something in the wall.
What's up there?

268
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:30,594
Well, there's only one way to find out.

269
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:32,346
- Nora, no. Please don't fall.
- Be careful.

270
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:35,106
Zahir, give me your hand. Come on.

271
00:23:35,365 --> 00:23:36,433
Okay, ready?

272
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,102
- Yeah. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

273
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:43,440
All right, I almost have the ledge.
Yeah. I got it. Okay.

274
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,410
All right.

275
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:49,211
You okay?

276
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:51,615
Guys, you got to come check this out.

277
00:23:51,715 --> 00:23:55,055
- What do you see?
- Just come up here.

278
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:04,294
I've never seen anything
like this before.

279
00:24:04,394 --> 00:24:06,296
I thought this thing
was supposed to be a tomb.

280
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:08,256
It is.

281
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:12,736
- What's with the arsenal?
- It's ceremonial.

282
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:16,691
The ancient Egyptians buried
their pharaohs with an armory of spears,

283
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,850
for use in the afterlife.

284
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,750
Usually, they're placed next to
the sarcophagus, never separately.

285
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,877
Dad?

286
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:29,788
Look at that.

287
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:35,618
Mended at the shaft. It's broken.

288
00:24:35,926 --> 00:24:38,829
And I wonder... Yeah, look at this.

289
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:41,164
There's a chip in this blade.

290
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:44,684
So these...
these were not just ceremonial.

291
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:47,891
These saw battle.

292
00:24:48,313 --> 00:24:51,113
- Switch off your lights.
- Lights off.

293
00:24:57,614 --> 00:24:59,933
- Look at that.
- What is that?

294
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:03,804
That is dried blood.

295
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:07,293
What does that mean?

296
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:10,027
I'll have to take it back
and analyze it and date it.

297
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:12,863
We won't know until then,
so go ahead and take that as a sample.

298
00:25:12,963 --> 00:25:14,835
Okay.

299
00:25:15,135 --> 00:25:16,366
That's cool.

300
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:17,909
Hey, your wire.

301
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:19,649
- Your wire.
- What?

302
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:22,644
It must have snapped.

303
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:27,210
It's high-tension wire, doctor,
it doesn't just snap.

304
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,379
- Well, how...
- Fitzie, you stepped on it.

305
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:30,589
No, I didn't.

306
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:33,492
You probably didn't realize but you
must've done it as you were filming.

307
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:35,761
Realize I stepped on it?
You probably stepped on it!

308
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:38,555
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Probably Zahir, with his stupid robot.

309
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:39,890
It's all right, just calm down.

310
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,409
We're not that far from the entrance.
We'll set up another wire.

311
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,889
All right.

312
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:50,901
- Okay?
- Okay, it's this way.

313
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:53,946
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
It's not this way, it's that way.

314
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:56,051
Look, I copied down the hieroglyphs
in my notebook

315
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:57,708
- before we set off as we entered.
- No.

316
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,688
No, I think we came from
this direction over here.

317
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:03,134
They all look the same.

318
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:08,418
- Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
- That's enough, Fitzie.

319
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:10,754
Look, guys. It's this way.
It's this way.

320
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:13,664
See? This is why we attach a wire.

321
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:20,864
That's strange.
These hieroglyphs are all the same.

322
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:23,834
We only walked for a few minutes.

323
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:29,982
Guys, is it just me or is it becoming really,
really hard to breathe in these masks?

324
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:31,608
Pyramids are incredibly airtight.

325
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:35,253
Explains how mummies can remain
so perfectly preserved after all these years.

326
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:38,323
Yeah, no, I'm not talking about
some pyramid mumbo-jumbo here.

327
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:40,883
I'm being serious. Something's off.

328
00:26:46,306 --> 00:26:50,984
Now stay close.
I don't want to lose anybody. Okay?

329
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,030
Shouldn't we go back to where we were?

330
00:26:56,483 --> 00:27:00,470
- Yeah, I think it was back...
- No, it's impossible.

331
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,690
I was positive.

332
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:15,986
I'm sorry, honey. We have to go back
in the other direction. This looks...

333
00:27:16,086 --> 00:27:19,296
Yeah, we definitely came the wrong way.

334
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:23,544
- What could this chamber be?
- Holy shit!

335
00:27:24,094 --> 00:27:26,344
- What?
- Oh, no.

336
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:29,506
- There's Shorty.
- Oh, my God.

337
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:32,348
Come on!

338
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:39,568
We should not be here. Let's get out.

339
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:42,239
Oh, my God!

340
00:27:42,988 --> 00:27:45,358
Wait, nobody move! Nobody move.

341
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,309
All right.

342
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:48,769
All right.

343
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,354
Oh, my God.

344
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:54,465
- What's happening?
- The floor is about to collapse.

345
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:58,236
What?

346
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,739
We have to back out of here
one at a time.

347
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,492
Fitzie? Come on. You first.

348
00:28:03,592 --> 00:28:04,952
Easy.

349
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:08,752
Move toward me,
and try not to step on the cracks.

350
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:14,469
That's good.
Come on. That's good, Fitzie.

351
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:17,186
Don't jump! Just...

352
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:18,715
Okay.

353
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:22,010
Just come on, come on, come on.
Good, good, good.

354
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,525
All right, that's good, that's good.
That's right. That's right.

355
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:28,475
- Oh, my God.
- That's right, that's right.

356
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:31,061
That's good. That's good.

357
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:33,871
Come on. That's good, Fitzie.

358
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,275
Okay, now, Zahir. Come on. Come on.

359
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,625
- Are you sure?
- Come!

360
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:46,410
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- It's all right, it's all right.

361
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,960
Come on, Michael, faster!

362
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:54,518
Everybody run!

363
00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:13,061
- Nora? Nora?
- I'm good. I'm good.

364
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:15,856
- Is anyone hurt?
- I'm alive.

365
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:17,706
Where are we?

366
00:29:17,874 --> 00:29:21,874
Jeez, I can't breathe
with this stupid mask.

367
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,070
What is that smell?

368
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:30,734
Smells like shit.

369
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:35,214
Where are we?

370
00:29:35,517 --> 00:29:40,063
I'm guessing where the animal who destroyed
Shorty decided to relieve itself.

371
00:29:40,163 --> 00:29:43,216
That's a lot of shit for just
one dog who got trapped.

372
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:47,387
Not only that, where did it go?

373
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:51,046
How'd it get out?
The only way out is up.

374
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:56,194
Still, we've got to get
out of here soon.

375
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,399
I haven't smelt anything this bad
since Zahir's tent

376
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,401
when he had the beans the other day.

377
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:04,175
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

378
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:06,590
Help me!

379
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,709
- Nora, wait!
- Michael, Michael! Oh, my God!

380
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:13,538
- Oh, my God!
- Help me!

381
00:30:13,638 --> 00:30:14,748
What are we gonna do?

382
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,667
Okay, man, don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of here.

383
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,794
Okay, come on, guys! Help me, please!

384
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:21,313
- Michael, Michael.
- Okay.

385
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,507
- Calm down.
- We need to push, all right?

386
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:24,967
All right. All right, push!

387
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:28,137
- One, two, three.
- My God.

388
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:34,398
- Come on. Push, push, push!
- Stop! Stop!

389
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:38,397
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay.

390
00:30:38,497 --> 00:30:40,399
What are you doing with the phone?
You're not gonna get reception down here.

391
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:45,362
We're 90 feet below ground. The walls
are six feet thick. Jesus, use your head.

392
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:48,572
We're never gonna be able to get
this rock off of him by ourselves.

393
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:52,059
And even if we do...

394
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:58,184
There's water in there, get it out.

395
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,212
Hey, hey. Listen to me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me. Take these.

396
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:04,792
I want you to swallow these, okay?
I want you to swallow.

397
00:31:06,316 --> 00:31:07,936
Here you go.

398
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:12,055
He's gonna be okay, doctor?
He's not gonna die, is he?

399
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:15,200
Fitzie! Just shut up, please!

400
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,103
You're not helping right now, okay?

401
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:21,373
Michael, Michael. Breathe.

402
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:23,775
Hey, baby. Look at me. Michael.

403
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:27,062
You are going to get out of here, okay?
Just breathe, that's right.

404
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:29,714
Breathe.

405
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:33,137
Stay back, something could still fall.

406
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:37,814
What are you looking at?

407
00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:42,325
This shaft should take us back
to where we came from.

408
00:31:43,603 --> 00:31:47,215
- You know, I think I can get up there.
- No, no, that's not a good idea.

409
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:50,135
I've been rock climbing my entire life.

410
00:31:50,235 --> 00:31:53,130
If you give me a boost,
I can brace myself in there and shimmy up.

411
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,700
Guys, she wants to climb this shaft.
Can you tell her she's crazy?

412
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,916
I can do it.

413
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,540
Don't worry.

414
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:05,586
Help me, come on!

415
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,019
Here, take this.
That way we can watch on the monitor.

416
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:12,353
Jesus.

417
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:16,319
How's that?
You're picking that up? Yeah?

418
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:17,454
All right.

419
00:32:17,554 --> 00:32:20,766
- Okay. All right.
- Okay, Sunni, be careful.

420
00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:22,866
Michael, calm down.

421
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:29,455
- Go slow!
- Yeah.

422
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,737
- Okay, be careful, Sunni.
- Go slow, go slow!

423
00:32:33,837 --> 00:32:35,537
Yeah.

424
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,180
Right, just take your time, okay?

425
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:47,251
You got it.
At the same time, don't take too long.

426
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:50,170
Just let us know if you see anything.

427
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,190
- Okay.
- Okay, Sunni?

428
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,468
Oh, God.

429
00:32:56,568 --> 00:32:58,598
- You okay? Go slow, okay?
- Yeah.

430
00:33:06,703 --> 00:33:08,753
What do you see?

431
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:13,706
I see two people
trying to break my concentration!

432
00:33:16,588 --> 00:33:20,046
- Are you okay?
- Did you guys hear that?

433
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:24,088
- I can't see anything.
- It's too dark.

434
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:27,457
Hang in there, Zahir.

435
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:30,544
Okay, let us know as soon as
you see anything, okay, Sunni?

436
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:33,264
I think something is up here.

437
00:33:39,236 --> 00:33:43,156
There's some kind of low tunnel
perpendicular to us.

438
00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:02,909
Oh, my God! Sunni, are you okay?

439
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:04,536
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Oh, God.

440
00:34:04,636 --> 00:34:06,672
- You okay, Fitzie?
- Okay.

441
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:09,142
- I think I've got shit in my ear.
- Dad, give me my bag.

442
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:12,669
Here, use this. What happened up there?

443
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:16,548
I saw something. I was almost there
and it popped out at me.

444
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:18,928
This is gonna sting, okay?

445
00:34:19,843 --> 00:34:22,204
So, was it... was it a dog, yeah?

446
00:34:22,304 --> 00:34:25,983
I didn't get a good look.
But when I saw it, I lost my...

447
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:29,170
- I have another bag.
- I saw its eyes.

448
00:34:29,953 --> 00:34:32,990
- What was it?
- Yeah, hold on.

449
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,485
It was the same thing we saw
before we lost contact with Shorty.

450
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:37,552
Sorry, sorry.

451
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:40,097
You know, maybe it's the soldier,
you know.

452
00:34:40,197 --> 00:34:41,740
He knows we're down here.
He's probably gonna be...

453
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,640
A soldier popped out of a hidden tunnel
and scratched my face.

454
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:50,307
Maybe there's a way out over there.

455
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:59,338
Hey, Michael. Michael.

456
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:07,124
These carvings tell a story.
You see these figures holding the spears.

457
00:35:07,224 --> 00:35:10,914
These are the same ones
we saw in the apex. This is...

458
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,420
This is a warning.

459
00:35:15,332 --> 00:35:17,402
A warning?

460
00:35:18,335 --> 00:35:21,405
- A warning for what?
- I don't know.

461
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:23,365
I think we should just stay here.

462
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:25,601
That soldier will come
looking for us eventually.

463
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:28,979
No, Michael might not have that long.
We have to look for another way out.

464
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:31,581
All right, then, fine.
What is your plan now, Nora?

465
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:33,041
If there is a gate here

466
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:36,153
then behind those stones there is
a passage and maybe another way out.

467
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:38,780
And if the gate has been standing here
for thousands of years,

468
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,517
maybe it's standing here for a reason.
Who are we to destroy it?

469
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:44,686
Jesus! Stop being an archaeologist
for a minute here,

470
00:35:44,786 --> 00:35:47,681
- and start being a human being!
- Look, she's right, okay?

471
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:50,936
We have to look for help!
Maybe we can try the shaft.

472
00:35:51,036 --> 00:35:55,095
Nora! Look at her face!
We don't know what's up there!

473
00:35:57,582 --> 00:36:00,185
Look, guys,
we can't just sit around here.

474
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:04,364
Okay, we've got things up there
scratching people's faces.

475
00:36:04,464 --> 00:36:08,024
- It stinks in here!
- So put your mask back on.

476
00:36:08,552 --> 00:36:11,438
No, I'm serious, man. Listen, like...

477
00:36:11,538 --> 00:36:16,610
If we can survive this drop
then so can it. Whatever it is.

478
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,183
And while we're trapped
in here we're like...

479
00:36:19,283 --> 00:36:22,241
just like food in a bowl right now.

480
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:26,159
All right, fine.

481
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:32,459
- There. You got it?
- I got it. Let's go over here.

482
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,809
Yeah, we're fine.

483
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:45,912
Okay, one more. Ready? One, two...

484
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:48,706
Oh, God.

485
00:36:52,245 --> 00:36:56,612
I don't know if it's safe in there.
For all we know that air could be...

486
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,903
Yeah, we'll take our chances.

487
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:03,031
If you ask me, it's not gonna be any worse
than the air we're breathing in here.

488
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:04,901
Yeah.

489
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:09,858
Hey.

490
00:37:10,972 --> 00:37:13,208
- You take it.
- No.

491
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:15,836
No. What, you want to sit here
in the dark?

492
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:17,388
No.

493
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:21,383
And besides, if we get lost then maybe
we can follow the light back.

494
00:37:21,483 --> 00:37:23,051
Okay?

495
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:26,691
You're not gonna need the hatchet,
but it's just in case.

496
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,500
I'm gonna go get you help, okay?

497
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:34,397
I'm gonna come back for you.

498
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,576
Hey, listen.

499
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:31,311
- It's that soldier! What's his name?
- Shadid!

500
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:33,564
- Shadid!
- Shadid, help us!

501
00:38:33,764 --> 00:38:35,123
- Hello!
- We're right over here!

502
00:38:35,223 --> 00:38:38,556
- Shadid!
- Where's it coming from?

503
00:38:39,094 --> 00:38:40,959
Can't tell.

504
00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:48,695
Did you guys hear that?

505
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:51,275
Help me! Help me!

506
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:53,308
What's happening to him?

507
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:55,752
You guys, that's not Shadid.
That's Michael.

508
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:57,729
- Michael!
- You should go! Go, go!

509
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:00,519
Find Shadid! Nora, wait!

510
00:39:08,673 --> 00:39:11,553
Shouldn't we just go with them?

511
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,359
How are we supposed to find Shadid?

512
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:35,069
Hello?

513
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:39,027
Shadid!

514
00:39:40,038 --> 00:39:42,938
Are you still there?

515
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:48,166
Michael.

516
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:52,264
Oh, my God.

517
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,080
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

518
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,380
Oh, my God.

519
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:03,446
No, no, no...

520
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,520
No, this isn't happening.

521
00:40:07,023 --> 00:40:08,833
No!

522
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:14,598
- Okay.
- No, this is not possible.

523
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:16,475
- I think we have to get out of here.
- No, no, no.

524
00:40:16,575 --> 00:40:19,169
- It's not safe.
- No, where is he?

525
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:20,854
No, no...

526
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:23,941
No, it's not happening. No.

527
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,442
- Nora.
- I don't believe it.

528
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:26,944
- Nora, Nora.
- No, I...

529
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:29,947
Honey, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

530
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:31,949
I know you cared for him,
but we have to go.

531
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:34,368
- Michael...
- I'm so sorry.

532
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:35,994
I'm so sorry.

533
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:39,831
- Honey, we have to go.
- Michael!

534
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:41,625
- We have to join the others, okay?
- I can't...

535
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:45,796
Okay, honey, you've got to focus now.
We got to get out of this pyramid.

536
00:40:45,896 --> 00:40:50,008
- It's not safe for us. Come on.
- Where did he go?

537
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:52,678
Come on. Okay, come on.

538
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:54,154
- Come on.
- I can't.

539
00:40:54,254 --> 00:40:56,114
Come on.

540
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:10,070
We should never have followed them.

541
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:15,158
What's taking them so long?
Should... should we go back there?

542
00:41:15,258 --> 00:41:19,176
Shadid! Shadid, can you hear us?

543
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:21,673
All right.

544
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:26,086
- What happened to Zahir?
- Zahir is dead.

545
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:30,215
He tried to shift the Boulder.
It rolled over and crushed him.

546
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:33,068
That's impossible. We couldn't shift
that thing between the four of us!

547
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:36,096
I don't know. I think he was chipping
away at it with the hatchet.

548
00:41:36,196 --> 00:41:40,415
That's a load of bull.
We heard the screams.

549
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:43,687
If there's anything we've learned today
it's that you're talking out of your ass.

550
00:41:43,787 --> 00:41:45,325
No, she's right, yeah.

551
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,442
You're lying to us.

552
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:51,278
What about the eyes I saw
at the top of the tunnel?

553
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,780
Whatever took a chunk
out of my face killed Zahir!

554
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,825
- Calm down, lady.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

555
00:41:56,925 --> 00:42:00,120
I'm sorry... but robot guy
has just been devoured

556
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,041
by a creature we cannot identify,
for Christ's sake! "Calm down."

557
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:06,293
- Who the hell do you think...
- Nobody made you come!

558
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:08,445
My job is to follow you guys
with the camera.

559
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:09,838
What, are you just following orders now?

560
00:42:09,938 --> 00:42:13,217
Step up and take responsibility
for your own actions!

561
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:15,052
Hey! Back off!

562
00:42:15,152 --> 00:42:16,720
- Keep her away from me!
- Back off!

563
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,388
Jesus, Sunni, relax.

564
00:42:18,488 --> 00:42:22,893
Don't tell me to relax! This asshole
has led us into a death trap!

565
00:42:22,993 --> 00:42:25,520
- I don't need this right now.
- Look, Sunni, all right?

566
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,564
You're panicking
and you're freaking out!

567
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:29,024
You're just looking for someone
to blame right now.

568
00:42:29,124 --> 00:42:30,567
I found him.

569
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:35,030
Well, that attitude is not going
to help us out right now, is it?

570
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,407
All right, just relax.

571
00:42:37,507 --> 00:42:40,017
Come on, just breathe.

572
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:44,406
I'm su... I'm sure we can
find a way out of here.

573
00:42:44,806 --> 00:42:49,962
What we need to do is to find Shadid.
He got in here, we can get out.

574
00:42:50,062 --> 00:42:51,338
- Yeah.
- How's that?

575
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:53,688
Yeah, great.

576
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,658
What's up?

577
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:03,868
No, it was nothing.
Come on, Fitzie, you go first.

578
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:07,375
What?

579
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:09,564
- Me?
- Yes.

580
00:43:09,664 --> 00:43:11,544
What am I, a bloody Guinea pig?

581
00:43:14,169 --> 00:43:17,739
For God's sake.
Are you seeing how tight this is?

582
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,669
Just go.

583
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:22,489
Bloody hell.

584
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:39,985
- Are you sure this is the way?
- Can't be sure of anything in this place.

585
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:49,980
So...

586
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,566
Remind me again, guys, what do I do
if this thing jumps out at me,

587
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,026
and scratches my face off?

588
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:56,920
You try to put as much distance
as you can between you and it.

589
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,281
Right, this is probably
about as fast as I can move right now.

590
00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:02,884
Just move faster, Fitzie! I don't want
to be here long enough to find out!

591
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:08,305
Guys.

592
00:44:12,352 --> 00:44:13,920
- Guys?
- Yeah.

593
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,057
- Something's behind us!
- What do we do? What do we do?

594
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:19,397
- Keep going!
- Just move! Move!

595
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:22,512
Just move, Fitzie! Move!

596
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:25,599
Go! Go! Go!
Go as fast as you can, Fitzie!

597
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:27,517
It's coming faster!

598
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:28,602
Shit.

599
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:31,302
- Oh, God!
- Don't stop.

600
00:44:33,081 --> 00:44:35,184
Oh, God. Oh, my God!
There's something here.

601
00:44:35,584 --> 00:44:36,735
Shit!

602
00:44:36,835 --> 00:44:40,869
- Keep going. Keep going.
- It's coming faster!

603
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:45,010
Guys, the soldier's here!

604
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:48,349
It's Shadid.
Where the hell did he come from?

605
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,674
Hurry up, Fitzie!
Keep moving. Keep moving.

606
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:57,232
Come on. Come on. Come on.

607
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:02,896
- Get back. Get back.
- Everybody, get back! Get back!

608
00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:20,697
Jesus.

609
00:45:22,964 --> 00:45:25,334
What the hell was that?

610
00:45:36,144 --> 00:45:38,074
Oh, my God.

611
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:45,535
- Holy shit!
- Lights! Fitzie! Come on.

612
00:45:45,862 --> 00:45:48,662
Turn it off. Kill the light!

613
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,776
- We should...
- No, no, no.

614
00:45:59,876 --> 00:46:02,406
Just don't move a muscle.

615
00:46:06,508 --> 00:46:08,668
Fitzie, shut up.

616
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:23,271
We should be very quiet.

617
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:43,386
What the fuck was that?

618
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:45,572
I have no idea.

619
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:50,928
Did you see the claws on that thing?
What the hell is going on down here?

620
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:59,099
All right.

621
00:47:08,945 --> 00:47:11,145
Don't go too close.

622
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:15,687
Is it gone?

623
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:27,239
Sunni, that scratch
is becoming really infected.

624
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:29,808
Your eye is not looking
too good, either.

625
00:47:29,908 --> 00:47:32,638
We need to find an exit right now.

626
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:42,462
Please tell me there is something on this
wall that explains how to get out of here

627
00:47:42,562 --> 00:47:45,257
or at least
what the bloody hell is after us.

628
00:47:45,357 --> 00:47:49,517
This panel depicts the final judgment,
the weighing of souls.

629
00:47:50,153 --> 00:47:51,221
What?

630
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:54,121
It's from the Egyptian book of the dead.

631
00:47:54,658 --> 00:47:56,393
When a person died,
they passed into a room.

632
00:47:56,493 --> 00:48:00,063
They were brought before Osiris
and a panel of judges.

633
00:48:00,163 --> 00:48:02,482
And next to them was a massive scale.

634
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:07,487
Then the God Anubis weighed their heart
against Maat, the goddess of truth.

635
00:48:07,587 --> 00:48:12,077
And if it balanced perfectly,
they passed into the afterlife.

636
00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:14,995
They believed they were sent to the sky
to dwell among the stars.

637
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:17,914
I thought the book of the dead
was just full of spells and incantations.

638
00:48:18,014 --> 00:48:20,004
No, it's more than that.

639
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:22,324
It's a guide to immortality.

640
00:48:22,424 --> 00:48:28,316
This was central to Egyptian philosophy.
This is the final milestone.

641
00:48:29,985 --> 00:48:33,065
What, and you believe
in this rubbish, do you?

642
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:38,101
They believed it. I think the priests
acted out this ritual.

643
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:40,228
None of this matters
unless we get out of here.

644
00:48:40,328 --> 00:48:42,538
We've got to go. Let's go! Let's go.

645
00:48:54,885 --> 00:48:56,870
What do you see?

646
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,270
It's a dead end.

647
00:49:24,406 --> 00:49:26,206
Fuck!

648
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:33,713
- What was that?
- I thought you said don't touch anything.

649
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,260
What now?

650
00:49:47,245 --> 00:49:49,125
What...

651
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,681
We'll get buried if we don't go!

652
00:49:57,781 --> 00:49:58,801
Come on!

653
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:11,695
Go, go, go!

654
00:50:11,795 --> 00:50:13,465
Come on! Faster!

655
00:50:15,465 --> 00:50:17,067
- Nora!
- I'm trying!

656
00:50:17,467 --> 00:50:18,530
Nora.

657
00:50:20,303 --> 00:50:24,466
- Nora, come on! Come on!
- Dad, I can't move!

658
00:50:24,766 --> 00:50:26,766
I'm stuck!

659
00:50:27,811 --> 00:50:29,611
Guys!

660
00:50:34,151 --> 00:50:36,819
Dad! Dad!

661
00:50:37,612 --> 00:50:39,162
Help!

662
00:50:53,879 --> 00:50:56,406
Guys, I'm stuck! Help!

663
00:50:56,506 --> 00:50:57,741
All right. Give us...

664
00:50:57,841 --> 00:51:00,786
Sunni! Oh, God!

665
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:03,038
Oh, my God! Sunni!

666
00:51:03,138 --> 00:51:05,390
Come on. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

667
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,676
Give me your hand. Come on!
Just pull! Wiggle your legs!

668
00:51:07,976 --> 00:51:11,213
God! I'm gonna help you!
I'm gonna get you!

669
00:51:11,313 --> 00:51:13,163
Guys!

670
00:51:15,025 --> 00:51:16,175
Shit!

671
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,385
No!

672
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:23,201
No, no, no, no! Don't! Sunni!

673
00:51:23,367 --> 00:51:24,726
Guys!

674
00:51:24,826 --> 00:51:26,436
- Oh, God! No!
- Help! We need your help!

675
00:51:26,536 --> 00:51:28,566
Oh, God.

676
00:51:32,918 --> 00:51:37,114
Get away! Please... Sunni... Get away!

677
00:51:37,214 --> 00:51:38,782
Help!

678
00:51:38,882 --> 00:51:41,243
- Dad!
- Give me your hand. Give me your hand!

679
00:51:41,343 --> 00:51:42,911
- Help me.
- Just don't...

680
00:51:43,011 --> 00:51:44,121
- Keep at it!
- Dad!

681
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:45,539
- You're doing great. Come on. Give me...
- Dad!

682
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:49,863
Wiggle your legs! Come on, honey!
You have to keep squirming! Nora!

683
00:51:55,524 --> 00:51:57,334
Sunni!

684
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:00,458
I'm gonna get you! Guys!

685
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:05,534
Right there. Right there.
Come on. Come on.

686
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:10,897
Come on, and give me your hand!
Come on! Come on, Nora!

687
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:13,207
Hold on! Nora!

688
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,068
Got it! God...

689
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:17,670
Come on. I got your hand.
I got you, I got you.

690
00:52:20,924 --> 00:52:23,294
- Pull!
- I am...

691
00:52:28,598 --> 00:52:30,398
Nora...

692
00:52:31,268 --> 00:52:33,348
Thank God. Thank God.

693
00:52:35,105 --> 00:52:36,835
Oh, God!

694
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:40,439
- Fitzie!
- Doctor!

695
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,322
Jesus. Oh, my God.

696
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,050
Okay!

697
00:52:52,414 --> 00:52:54,274
Come here, guys.
Fitzie, get on the corner.

698
00:52:54,374 --> 00:52:56,485
Take the rope.
I'm gonna throw it to you. All right?

699
00:52:56,585 --> 00:52:58,695
- Get the end. You got it?
- Yes!

700
00:52:58,795 --> 00:53:02,991
Great. Sunni, just hold on, we're coming
right down, all right? Watch out!

701
00:53:03,091 --> 00:53:04,534
Wait.

702
00:53:04,634 --> 00:53:06,694
Be careful.

703
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:13,137
Grip tight. Grip tight. Grip tight.
That's right. You're doing great.

704
00:53:16,772 --> 00:53:20,805
Jesus. She's... Here, here.

705
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:24,616
Okay.

706
00:53:29,117 --> 00:53:30,560
Lift up...

707
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,231
Right there, okay. Is that better?
Is that better? Okay.

708
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:39,128
Just try not to breathe so hard,
all right? Long breaths, yeah.

709
00:53:40,462 --> 00:53:44,199
Nora. Come on, change places with me.
Cradle her head.

710
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:46,009
- Okay. Okay.
- Just take her head.

711
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:54,418
- Oh, God.
- We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

712
00:53:54,518 --> 00:53:55,752
- Right, guys?
- Let's do it.

713
00:53:55,852 --> 00:53:57,671
All right,
we're gonna get you off, Sunni.

714
00:53:57,771 --> 00:53:59,339
- Okay, you got her legs?
- Yeah, yeah.

715
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:02,175
- I got her shoulders.
- Okay. Pull straight up, all right?

716
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:04,344
On the count of three. One...

717
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:07,252
Two... Three.

718
00:54:08,463 --> 00:54:10,974
Pull. Come on!

719
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:18,400
Stop! Stop, stop!

720
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,069
- Okay, okay, okay.
- It's not working.

721
00:54:21,169 --> 00:54:22,946
If we lift her off,
she's gonna bleed out.

722
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:25,656
Okay, okay.

723
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:27,409
Shit!

724
00:54:27,509 --> 00:54:30,829
- Okay, let's try again.
- No! She can't take it.

725
00:54:30,929 --> 00:54:34,467
- Just give her a second, all right.
- Oh, God.

726
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:37,210
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Jesus. Jesus.

727
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:38,670
- Hold her. Hold her, hold her.
- Oh, my God!

728
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,673
- Sunni! I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Hold her! HHold her! Hold her still!

729
00:54:41,773 --> 00:54:45,341
- I can't, I can't! I can't!
- She can't twist! Hold her!

730
00:54:46,737 --> 00:54:50,057
She's gone into... Okay.

731
00:54:50,157 --> 00:54:51,216
Oh, God.

732
00:54:51,616 --> 00:54:54,519
- Sunni?
- Oh, God.

733
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:56,355
Oh, my God.

734
00:54:56,455 --> 00:54:58,482
Oh, my God.

735
00:54:58,582 --> 00:55:01,109
I think I... I think I can
get her leg off.

736
00:55:01,209 --> 00:55:04,696
I think if I just get her leg off,
then we can get her out of here.

737
00:55:04,796 --> 00:55:06,156
- Fitzie, that's it.
- Oh, my God.

738
00:55:06,256 --> 00:55:10,253
No. No, no, no. We need to get her off.

739
00:55:11,928 --> 00:55:13,998
Oh, my God.

740
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,004
Those creatures can come back
at any minute. We have to go now.

741
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:42,038
Dad? Your neck.

742
00:55:42,834 --> 00:55:44,778
Shit, is that...

743
00:55:44,878 --> 00:55:47,072
- Like the digger!
- Probably.

744
00:55:47,172 --> 00:55:48,615
- Just...
- What?

745
00:55:48,715 --> 00:55:51,243
But why has it appeared now?

746
00:55:51,343 --> 00:55:53,287
The masks stopped the onset.

747
00:55:53,387 --> 00:55:56,331
For some reason,
the progress has been slowed.

748
00:55:56,431 --> 00:55:58,875
- Why didn't you say anything?
- What difference does it make?

749
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:03,475
If I'm infected, we all will be.
It doesn't... Sorry.

750
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:09,721
- Okay, we got to get out of here right now.
- Well, that's our only choice.

751
00:56:16,493 --> 00:56:17,603
You okay, Fitzie?

752
00:56:17,703 --> 00:56:19,605
- Yeah.
- All right.

753
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:22,524
Those things...
I think they're sphynx cats.

754
00:56:22,624 --> 00:56:24,109
Like the statue?

755
00:56:24,209 --> 00:56:26,194
The ancient Egyptians
believed that cats, like bastet,

756
00:56:26,294 --> 00:56:28,030
were the guardians of the underworld.

757
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:31,199
They could have been placed here
to protect whomever was buried in here.

758
00:56:31,299 --> 00:56:33,379
All right, this way.

759
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:37,289
How have they survived all this time
without any food or water?

760
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:41,043
I think they ate each other.
Each generation feeding the next.

761
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:43,754
Like... like rats.

762
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:47,007
Great, so to survive down here,
you have to resort to cannibalism.

763
00:56:47,107 --> 00:56:49,426
That would explain the air toxicity.

764
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:53,786
Okay, I see an opening overhead.

765
00:57:01,788 --> 00:57:05,498
Fitzie, bring your camera here,
I need the light.

766
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,630
How can we possibly be back here?

767
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,034
It's a labyrinth.

768
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:18,246
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's just think this through logically.

769
00:57:18,346 --> 00:57:22,626
All right, we can't go that way,
that's a sand trap.

770
00:57:22,726 --> 00:57:26,338
And we know that that's a dead end.

771
00:57:26,438 --> 00:57:30,428
But corporal Shadid got in here somehow,
so there has to be a way out.

772
00:57:30,734 --> 00:57:32,970
How can we...

773
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:34,940
Look.

774
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:38,041
Shorty.

775
00:57:42,954 --> 00:57:47,994
You know, this antenna might still be
broadcasting a signal to the outside.

776
00:57:51,296 --> 00:57:54,012
- Well, what are you thinking?
- Hold on one second.

777
00:58:01,056 --> 00:58:05,419
I can rewire my camera to it
and we can record a message

778
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:07,679
and send it to one
of the outside monitors.

779
00:58:07,979 --> 00:58:11,717
- Well, will that work?
- It's worth a shot. I mean...

780
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:15,738
I can't guarantee anyone's gonna see it,
but, it'd improve our odds.

781
00:58:16,238 --> 00:58:17,948
What's that?

782
00:58:19,032 --> 00:58:21,582
- Look.
- Brilliant.

783
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:36,992
Okay, so be quick, doctor.

784
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:39,578
I'm not sure how long
this aerial battery's gonna last.

785
00:58:39,678 --> 00:58:44,558
And also, you know, the cat creatures.

786
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:48,845
Hopefully someone will bother to play
back these tapes when they find our gear.

787
00:58:49,396 --> 00:58:51,836
If they find it.

788
00:58:54,484 --> 00:58:59,454
My name is Dr. Miles Holden. And I was
a Professor at Princeton university.

789
00:58:59,573 --> 00:59:02,851
I am trapped in the excavation site
with my daughter,

790
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:07,121
Dr. Nora Holden, and cameraman
Terry Fitzsimmons.

791
00:59:07,914 --> 00:59:09,483
And we need help.

792
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:12,027
Two of our team members,
engineer Michael Zahir,

793
00:59:12,127 --> 00:59:16,757
and documentary filmmaker
Sunni Marshe, are dead.

794
00:59:16,923 --> 00:59:20,202
This pyramid, unlike any other structure
I've ever encountered,

795
00:59:20,302 --> 00:59:22,120
seems to have been built
with the express purpose

796
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,415
of keeping whatever
is inside from escaping.

797
00:59:25,515 --> 00:59:30,265
If you come down here, bring guns.

798
00:59:33,023 --> 00:59:35,033
Is that good?

799
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:38,744
Yeah, it was good. It was really good.

800
00:59:41,323 --> 00:59:43,058
Did you feel that?

801
00:59:43,158 --> 00:59:44,828
Yeah.

802
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:56,196
Wow.

803
00:59:56,296 --> 00:59:58,282
It's like a vacuum pulling the air out.

804
00:59:58,382 --> 01:00:00,422
What is it?

805
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,890
I think something's back there.

806
01:00:03,011 --> 01:00:06,101
- I think it's a way out.
- How do you know that?

807
01:00:06,223 --> 01:00:07,536
I don't.

808
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:17,399
Careful, doc. Remember the last time
you started touching things.

809
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:31,440
How did you find that?

810
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,000
I didn't spend my entire life
behind a desk, you know.

811
01:00:35,794 --> 01:00:37,696
Creepy stuff.

812
01:00:37,796 --> 01:00:40,040
- Do you think Shadid came this way?
- I do.

813
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,702
This doesn't look like the Egypt stuff
you find at the British museum, eh, guys?

814
01:00:43,802 --> 01:00:47,802
This possibly could be a link
to an older civilization.

815
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,970
So...

816
01:01:15,959 --> 01:01:18,070
How are you feeling, doc?

817
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,197
I want to get out of here.

818
01:01:20,297 --> 01:01:21,990
Yeah.

819
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,587
- What?
- Do you...

820
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:29,873
I mean, do you feel any sicker or...

821
01:01:29,973 --> 01:01:33,773
You know what? I really haven't had
that much time to think about it.

822
01:01:37,022 --> 01:01:39,092
Man.

823
01:01:41,526 --> 01:01:43,346
So...

824
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:47,099
From the shitty room
to the kitty tomb...

825
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:50,619
That, you know, also smells like shit.

826
01:01:51,328 --> 01:01:54,398
You think this was built
to be some sort of prison, then, doc?

827
01:01:54,498 --> 01:01:56,775
Well, many temples in the ancient world

828
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,955
were thought to be
the earthly dwelling places of the gods.

829
01:02:00,087 --> 01:02:01,947
Some were benign and giving.

830
01:02:02,047 --> 01:02:06,368
Others, like the gods
the Aztecs worshipped, were violent.

831
01:02:06,468 --> 01:02:07,619
They were imprisoned,

832
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:11,081
and then they were fed a steady diet
of human sacrifice to appease them.

833
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:14,710
Thousands were sacrificed.
As their hearts were cut out,

834
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:18,088
their bodies were kicked down
the pyramid steps.

835
01:02:18,188 --> 01:02:21,398
So, what's your point?

836
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:25,743
Whatever we're dealing with,
it's not benign and giving.

837
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:39,860
Let's go deeper into this hellhole.

838
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,750
Make it completely impossible for them
to discover our bodies.

839
01:02:50,287 --> 01:02:51,783
Oh, shit.

840
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:06,600
I think we found
the bottom of the pyramid.

841
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:13,077
Well...

842
01:03:13,994 --> 01:03:16,733
Now we just have to find...

843
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:20,171
the right escape shaft.

844
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:33,530
Dad?

845
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:36,157
- Dad?
- What?

846
01:03:38,477 --> 01:03:40,347
Jesus.

847
01:03:41,104 --> 01:03:43,048
Well, well, well, well.

848
01:03:43,148 --> 01:03:46,253
We were not the first ones here.
What happened to him?

849
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,913
Shit. Shit, look at that.

850
01:03:50,013 --> 01:03:52,003
- Hey, hey.
- What?

851
01:03:56,703 --> 01:03:58,903
That's a freemason symbol.

852
01:03:59,206 --> 01:04:02,150
They must've built the offshoot tunnel
that we entered.

853
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,450
Yeah, it makes sense.

854
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:07,656
All right, yeah,
this is all very interesting, but...

855
01:04:07,756 --> 01:04:12,961
our main priority should be getting out
of here. The masons aren't important.

856
01:04:13,261 --> 01:04:17,159
They were excellent tomb robbers.
If they couldn't find a way out...

857
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,670
- Shit.
- What?

858
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:24,060
- I can't read this.
- What is that?

859
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:26,551
Here, give it to me.

860
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:31,496
Guys, can we drop the history crap for
five minutes, please... and get out of here?

861
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:33,646
Just read it!

862
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:35,934
It's a journal.

863
01:04:36,034 --> 01:04:38,294
Fitzie, I need your light.

864
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:42,549
"May 21st, 1897.

865
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:46,789
"The path we took upon our entry
into the pyramid has been blocked.

866
01:04:47,045 --> 01:04:51,965
"We may have located a means of escape
in the burial chamber."

867
01:04:57,222 --> 01:04:59,552
That's the last entry.

868
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:05,101
And this looks like
the burial chamber to me.

869
01:05:06,164 --> 01:05:08,425
All right. Well, then...

870
01:05:08,525 --> 01:05:10,886
there might be a means of escape!

871
01:05:10,986 --> 01:05:13,986
You're right. We have to keep going.
We don't want to end up...

872
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:20,872
- Dad! Dad!
- Nora! Run!

873
01:05:26,293 --> 01:05:29,363
Nora! Let's go!

874
01:05:32,424 --> 01:05:34,660
No! I have to go back for him!

875
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,453
- No, we can't!
- I have to go back!

876
01:05:36,553 --> 01:05:40,082
I'm sorry, we've got to go! Keep going!

877
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:42,082
Oh, my God!

878
01:05:43,018 --> 01:05:45,170
What? No!

879
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:48,100
No! No!

880
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:51,481
Oh, my God.

881
01:06:03,914 --> 01:06:05,914
I can't...

882
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:10,136
He's gone.

883
01:06:10,462 --> 01:06:12,582
He's gone.

884
01:06:15,217 --> 01:06:20,054
There must be some sort of latch or...
or mechanism that your dad found.

885
01:06:21,473 --> 01:06:23,763
I don't know.

886
01:06:26,436 --> 01:06:27,696
I don't...

887
01:06:30,565 --> 01:06:32,355
You know what?

888
01:06:32,651 --> 01:06:34,803
Screw it.

889
01:06:34,903 --> 01:06:38,223
I'd rather face him once and for all
than spend the rest of my life running.

890
01:06:38,323 --> 01:06:40,233
Are you out of your mind?

891
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:45,123
Nora, come on. Look at all
this shit we've been through!

892
01:06:45,956 --> 01:06:48,191
Someone will find our tapes.

893
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:51,721
The least I can do is
let people know who killed me.

894
01:06:52,254 --> 01:06:53,697
What is wrong with you?

895
01:06:53,797 --> 01:06:57,868
My dad just died and all you care about
is getting your shot.

896
01:06:57,968 --> 01:07:01,138
It's not about the shot, Nora.

897
01:07:01,638 --> 01:07:04,438
I just don't know what else to do.

898
01:07:05,892 --> 01:07:08,545
Fitzie, please don't leave me.

899
01:07:08,645 --> 01:07:12,614
Fitzie, please... Fitzie...

900
01:08:16,505 --> 01:08:19,283
- Oh, God.
- Help!

901
01:08:19,383 --> 01:08:21,833
He's still alive.

902
01:08:41,905 --> 01:08:45,601
Help... help, help...

903
01:08:45,701 --> 01:08:47,501
No...

904
01:09:38,962 --> 01:09:40,093
Nora.

905
01:10:46,446 --> 01:10:48,516
It's me.

906
01:10:58,083 --> 01:11:01,920
This isn't real.
No, this can't be happening.

907
01:11:02,087 --> 01:11:04,167
It's impossible.

908
01:11:05,632 --> 01:11:09,972
It's Anubis, or the devourer.

909
01:11:10,303 --> 01:11:13,833
He took my father's heart
to weigh his soul.

910
01:11:16,059 --> 01:11:18,712
What are you talking about?

911
01:11:18,812 --> 01:11:22,674
Anubis, half man, half jackal.

912
01:11:22,774 --> 01:11:26,394
He ate the hearts of those
he found to be impure.

913
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:29,553
In the book of the dead
the last judgment

914
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:34,447
is the final gate
before resurrection or damnation.

915
01:11:36,496 --> 01:11:40,036
If there's a way out,
it's inside that room.

916
01:11:40,917 --> 01:11:45,822
We don't have a choice. We can either
stay here and die, or we...

917
01:11:45,922 --> 01:11:47,812
Or we can die trying.

918
01:12:16,703 --> 01:12:19,243
Oh, God, it's the soldier.

919
01:12:44,815 --> 01:12:46,383
Come on, Nora.

920
01:12:46,483 --> 01:12:49,563
I'm so sorry, Dad.

921
01:13:05,585 --> 01:13:08,415
Come on, Nora. Grab his flare.

922
01:13:23,603 --> 01:13:25,313
Wait.

923
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:38,710
It tells the story of Osiris.

924
01:13:41,538 --> 01:13:44,650
Osiris. No, no, no. You said Anubis.

925
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:47,778
Osiris was his father or his creator.

926
01:13:47,878 --> 01:13:50,968
It's the same symbol for both words.

927
01:13:51,798 --> 01:13:53,767
Egyptians believe Osiris
came from the heavens,

928
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:55,060
and brought agriculture
and tool-making...

929
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,204
I get that you find
this stuff fascinating, okay?

930
01:13:57,304 --> 01:14:01,333
But right now what we should be
working on is how to get out of here.

931
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:05,042
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Osiris knew that his time had come on earth

932
01:14:05,142 --> 01:14:07,965
so he had this pyramid built
for his journey into the afterlife.

933
01:14:08,065 --> 01:14:11,270
Nora, I promise you, look...
I've got it all down on tape.

934
01:14:11,370 --> 01:14:13,855
All right? You can watch it back
as soon as we're out.

935
01:14:14,963 --> 01:14:16,823
Anubis turned his wrath on the people.

936
01:14:17,991 --> 01:14:22,249
He had hundreds of them sacrificed so he
could join his father in the afterlife.

937
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:25,983
Since his soul was corrupted,
he was looking for a pure one...

938
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:28,833
a pure heart, if you will.

939
01:14:29,127 --> 01:14:31,297
The only way to enter
the final gate of heaven.

940
01:14:32,589 --> 01:14:37,077
My father was right.
This pyramid became a prison.

941
01:14:37,177 --> 01:14:39,705
Closed by the Egyptians
to get rid of their own God.

942
01:14:39,805 --> 01:14:44,126
Nora, does this thing give us any clues
on how to get out of here?

943
01:14:44,226 --> 01:14:47,070
- It says something about a star map.
- Then you got to find it, okay?

944
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:50,940
Because your friend Anubis
is gonna be back any minute now!

945
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:55,573
The exit shaft points to where the dead
was supposed to be resurrected.

946
01:14:58,490 --> 01:15:02,002
Well, then... there must be
at least six shafts in this room.

947
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:04,632
How do we know which is the right one?

948
01:15:07,207 --> 01:15:08,273
The stars...

949
01:15:12,212 --> 01:15:16,094
Look at the ceiling.
Fitzie, turn off your light.

950
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:19,578
Look at the ceiling.

951
01:15:19,678 --> 01:15:23,832
In between the hieroglyphs,
all those dots. That's the star map!

952
01:15:23,932 --> 01:15:27,753
- So what exactly are we looking for?
- The tetrahedron.

953
01:15:27,853 --> 01:15:32,363
The three-sided pyramid is also
the hieroglyphic symbol for the Sirius star.

954
01:15:35,902 --> 01:15:39,699
Look! There it is. The brightest one.

955
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:44,478
It's right above this shaft.
It's got to be our way out!

956
01:15:44,578 --> 01:15:47,038
Okay. Well, let's go check it out.

957
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:50,882
Okay. Come on!

958
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:53,211
It's got to be the one.

959
01:15:53,336 --> 01:15:56,203
Look! The rope. That's got to be
how the soldier entered.

960
01:15:57,007 --> 01:16:02,162
Thank you, captain Egypt.
You think that thing will hold us both?

961
01:16:02,262 --> 01:16:05,323
- I guess we have to see.
- Okay.

962
01:16:05,423 --> 01:16:07,918
- Okay.
- All right, you go first.

963
01:16:08,018 --> 01:16:11,311
Here, take this. Just in case.

964
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:15,768
- I'll be right behind you.
- Okay, hold that.

965
01:16:19,654 --> 01:16:21,664
Okay.

966
01:16:23,241 --> 01:16:26,411
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

967
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:31,840
Try and get your leg up on that ledge.

968
01:16:53,146 --> 01:16:55,856
Can't be much further now.

969
01:16:58,902 --> 01:17:01,471
Shit! He's back! Go, Nora! Go!

970
01:17:01,571 --> 01:17:04,911
Don't look back! Fitzie, keep going!
Don't look down!

971
01:17:05,659 --> 01:17:08,645
Shit, he's back! Go, Nora! Go! Go! Go!

972
01:17:08,745 --> 01:17:10,063
Come on, Fitzie, move!

973
01:17:10,163 --> 01:17:11,690
- I'm coming!
- Move! Move!

974
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,720
Go on!

975
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:16,795
Come on, Fitzie! Keep going!
Come on! Don't look down!

976
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:24,048
Climb!

977
01:17:26,763 --> 01:17:28,973
Fitzie!

978
01:17:48,702 --> 01:17:51,082
Help! Help!

979
01:18:04,176 --> 01:18:06,206
No!

980
01:19:25,273 --> 01:19:27,098
Fitzie.

981
01:19:27,676 --> 01:19:29,486
No!

982
01:22:12,382 --> 01:22:14,192
Yeah...

983
01:23:31,837 --> 01:23:33,972
Help me.

984
01:23:34,072 --> 01:23:35,762
Help me.

985
01:23:41,263 --> 01:23:44,803
Help, please...

986
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:47,551
Please help me.
