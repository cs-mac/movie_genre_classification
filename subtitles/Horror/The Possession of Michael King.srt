1
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,525
Oh, my God. Enough, camera addict.

2
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,068
Okay, okay. Just a second, though.

3
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,195
Before I turn it off, what is
your New Year's resolution?

4
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,821
Ha! Really?

5
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,199
Yeah, I want to get it on tape
so that I can hold you to it.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,617
Please, you don't keep those.

7
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,827
That is a fantastic attitude
you have right there.

8
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,329
We're going to this time.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,831
Yeah? All right, fine.

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,292
I solemnly swear

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,878
on this New Year's resolution

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,631
to go to the gym and get in shape.

13
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,966
Oh, hell, yeah.

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,260
How about you, ladybug?
What's your New Year's resolution?

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,636
What's that?

16
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,473
It's like a vow or a promise that
you make to be a better person.

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,725
Yeah, or always eat your spinach.

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,644
- Yuck.
- Okay, I got one for you.

19
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,230
How about you tell your mommy that
you love her at least once a day?

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,607
- Okay.
- You can start right now.

21
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,901
- I love you, Mom.
- How about you, Fishbone?

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,653
What's your resolution?

23
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,863
- Your turn.
- My resolution.

24
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,991
To make a documentary
about this family

25
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,867
so that I can show the whole world

26
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,578
what a lucky guy I am.

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,288
- You are a lucky guy.
- That's right.

28
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,456
And I thank God every day.

29
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,208
If only you believed in God.

30
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,835
Yeah, that'd probably
help a little bit.

31
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,420
Oh, crap. You know what?

32
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,380
I didn't put change in that meter.
We're gonna get a ticket.

33
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,757
- Dad, can you help me?
- What's up?

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,925
- Here, I got it.
- You sure?

35
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,803
- Yup.
- Thanks, babe.

36
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,853
So, Beverly, your psychic powers,

37
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,813
when did you first discover them?

38
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,691
Well, everyone's born
with them, you know.

39
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,278
But most folks don't know
how to develop them.

40
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,364
And your predictions, how many
of them you think have come true?

41
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,950
Well, all of them.

42
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,621
Have you ever felt
like you were preying

43
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,497
on someone's superstitions?

44
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,333
Or their emotions?

45
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,501
You know, like for example,
like telling a mother

46
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,046
that her missing son
would return alive

47
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,174
or breaking up a family
by advising for divorce.

48
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,717
You know what I mean?
Have you ever felt like

49
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,219
you led somebody
down the wrong path?

50
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,555
No, I don't think so.

51
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,474
You know, it's interesting,

52
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,060
my wife, she's always
wanted to go to Europe.

53
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,187
I finally put this
big trip together,

54
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,023
then at the last
second, she cancels.

55
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,067
She says that she needed to be here

56
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,903
for this big break in
her acting career.

57
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,365
A break that you
told her was coming.

58
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,868
I did.

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,163
And I'm guessing it hasn't, huh?

60
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,416
No.

61
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,377
It will.

62
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,087
Yeah, I don't think so.

63
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,761
And why is that?

64
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,265
She's dead.

65
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,140
Her name was Samantha.
Samantha King.

66
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,643
Yeah. She'd been coming
to you for years.

67
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,521
Oh, Sa...

68
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,065
oh, Samantha. Oh, gosh.

69
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,484
Fluke accident. Wrong
place, wrong time.

70
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,112
But, you know, the funny thing is

71
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:20,616
is that if we'd been on that trip,

72
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,994
if she hadn't listened to you
and we'd gone to Europe,

73
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,830
she'd still be alive.

74
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,873
Oh, God.

75
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,625
Oh, you can't think that I had...

76
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,212
You were giving her
spiritual guidance.

77
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,132
Guidance based on visions
you were receiving

78
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,009
from beyond the veil, from
higher powers, right?

79
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,344
And these visions,

80
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,974
they interfered with
her life, Beverly.

81
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,851
And she is dead as a direct result.

82
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,438
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

83
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,356
Okay, then admit it. Admit it.

84
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,359
Admit that all this,
this is just a scam.

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,613
That what you claim to do,
your psychic routine...

86
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,657
this is just a show, right?

87
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,160
This is a performance here.

88
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,498
Come on, Beverly. Come on.

89
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,378
I'm afraid that I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

90
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,132
Please?

91
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,020
What happens when you die?

92
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,390
I mean, everybody has
a theory, a guess,

93
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,184
a story that they'd
like to believe.

94
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,562
But at the end of the
day, we don't know.

95
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,356
Our ancestors worshiped fire

96
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,906
and sacrificed children
to vengeful gods.

97
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,030
We didn't know any
better back then.

98
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,449
What's our excuse now?

99
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,034
It's the 21st century,

100
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:48,078
yet we're still arguing
evolution versus creationism.

101
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,914
And why?

102
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,385
Because the truth scares people.

103
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,462
Nobody wants to die.

104
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,381
Nobody wants to cease to exist.

105
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,760
We want to believe that if
we follow a set of rules,

106
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,347
rules that were laid out by
some ancient, made-up god,

107
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,683
we're gonna continue on
in heaven as a spirit.

108
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,061
We're gonna be reincarnated.

109
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,564
While all that sounds great,

110
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,608
is any of it authentic?

111
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,827
I mean, what's the truth?

112
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,405
See, the truth is that
religion and spiritualism

113
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,867
are the most profitable
businesses in the world.

114
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,577
That throughout history,

115
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,913
there's never been a
single shred of evidence

116
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,508
that any of it is real.

117
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,961
Well, I've decided to prove it.

118
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,588
I want to test the
most authentic spells,

119
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,638
rituals, and summonings
that I can find.

120
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,679
I'm only going after the
blackest of the black magic.

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,640
The stuff that people
are scared of.

122
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,392
So that when they don't work,

123
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,185
people will pay attention.

124
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,895
And maybe, just maybe,

125
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,276
the world can take a step
forward collectively into reality.

126
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,989
The cameras will be
rolling on me 24/7

127
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,658
in the hopes that if
I uncover anything,

128
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,410
anything at all,

129
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:14,337
I'll have found the first
ever documented proof.

130
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,585
I'm the testing ground.

131
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,337
Me, Michael King.

132
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,341
So, God or the devil,

133
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,468
if you're out there,

134
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,137
prove it.

135
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,515
Come and get me.

136
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,022
Ladybug, what are you doing?

137
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,150
Why are you up?

138
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,610
I had a scary dream.

139
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,988
Uh-oh. Come here.
What was it about?

140
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,656
A monster.

141
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,367
A monster? Okay.

142
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,788
Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if this particular monster

143
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,167
is a tickle monster.

144
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,045
Come on. Come here, come here.

145
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,796
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

146
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,007
See, Fishbone's right.
Old Crowley here...

147
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,551
old Crowley here is the best
defense against tickle monsters.

148
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,970
- Get away! Get away!
- What are you doing?

149
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,263
- Hey, sis.
- What's going on?

150
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,350
Oh, we are... she had a nightmare.

151
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,935
Yeah, take Crowley with you.

152
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,770
Hey, listen.

153
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,022
Why don't I get in bed with you

154
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,857
and make sure that there
are no more monsters?

155
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,192
- Okay.
- Okay?

156
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,652
I think that's a great idea.

157
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,528
I'm really good at
fending off monsters.

158
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,697
Aunt Beth is the best.
Hey, young lady.

159
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,366
Where do you think you're going?

160
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,245
Are you okay?
All right, give me kisses.

161
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,704
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Dad.

162
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,081
Crowley's gonna take
care of you, okay?

163
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,832
- And Fishbone.
- Okay.

164
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,044
What is all this stuff, Michael?

165
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,713
I mean, you wonder why she's
getting all these nightmares?

166
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,298
Seriously?

167
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,093
It's my new project.

168
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,720
Oh, right.

169
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,222
What?

170
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,557
I thought that you would
be happy, of all people,

171
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,902
to see me, you know, getting
back to work and moving on.

172
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,816
This isn't really
moving on, Michael.

173
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,486
- Well, it is for me.
- Okay.

174
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,113
I'm gonna go put her to bed.

175
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,782
Okay, so last night I posted an ad.

176
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,743
Documentary filmmaker seeks
proof of the supernatural.

177
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,247
There must be, I don't know, over
300 hits on this thing already.

178
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,791
We've got Satanists,
voodoo, necromancy.

179
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,584
I even have a priest on here.

180
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,837
I guess that's Los
Angeles for you, right?

181
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,172
We're gonna have no shortage
of material, that's for sure.

182
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,550
What if one of these
fucking Satanists is a serial killer?

183
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,010
- What then?
- Are you serious?

184
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,679
Don't be such a pussy.

185
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,348
So, Father Gibbons,

186
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,892
the Church won't talk
about it publicly,

187
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,854
but behind closed doors you claim

188
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,107
they're performing exorcisms.

189
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,317
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

190
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,446
Okay. And these demons
that they're exorcising,

191
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,906
is there any proof
that they're real?

192
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,450
A physical proof?

193
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,119
Like horns and brimstone?

194
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,288
Fire, that kind of thing?

195
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,623
Well, any kind of thing.

196
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,795
I just don't understand why there's
never been any documented evidence.

197
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,131
What makes you think there's not?

198
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,216
I haven't seen any.

199
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,885
Well, I mean, of
course you haven't.

200
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,184
You haven't been allowed to.

201
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,725
Okay, listen, you
stated in your e-mail

202
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:24,605
that you had a real
experience, real proof,

203
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,649
but you don't, do you?

204
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,743
Okay.

205
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,654
When I was 10,

206
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,702
my father...

207
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,911
he started to take advantage of me.

208
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,413
Every night he would
come into my room...

209
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,501
close the door...

210
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,422
My mother, she must have known.

211
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,841
She prayed all the time.

212
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,135
That was her remedy.

213
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,513
God.

214
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,264
Well, I prayed to God,

215
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,851
but He never stopped
my father, not once.

216
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,276
So I gave up on God.

217
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,946
Started to pray to the devil.

218
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,444
Told him I would do anything

219
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,039
if he'd just make my father stop.

220
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,035
Well, one night not long after,

221
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,037
in the middle of one of his visits,

222
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,207
my father had a heart attack.

223
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,961
Died on the spot.

224
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,754
Wow.

225
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,590
That's awful.

226
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,969
I mean, what happened
to you, it's awful.

227
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,679
But come on.

228
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,809
I mean, how is that anything more
than just a strange coincidence?

229
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,189
Well, not long after, I...

230
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,734
began to hear him

231
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,778
calling out to me,

232
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,321
saying things.

233
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,241
I mean, awful, awful things.

234
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,744
The devil?

235
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,627
You hear him...

236
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,089
you don't answer.

237
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,462
Because if you do, he will
know you're listening

238
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,934
and he will never let you go.

239
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,429
Hmm.

240
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,773
Right.

241
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,936
Thank you for your time.
Appreciate it.

242
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,858
I ordered a demon summoning
kit off the Internet.

243
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,446
I lit the traditionally
evil-looking black candles.

244
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,615
I even sprung for the
expensive incense

245
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,326
because their Internet site said

246
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,831
that the demons get insulted
by the cheap stuff.

247
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,584
Got one plastic ritual altar.

248
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,461
Nice. Very nice.

249
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,714
And one photocopied booklet.

250
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,842
A lot of money went into
that guy right there, huh?

251
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,221
I also used Ellie's coloring
set to draw my symbols.

252
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,224
Somehow crayons seemed appropriate.

253
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,100
So basically what you do is this.

254
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,394
You draw the symbol

255
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,689
for the demon that
you wish to summon.

256
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,358
All right?

257
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,612
You read the spell from this.

258
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,823
Then you light it,

259
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,659
put it in the altar.

260
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,494
Voila.

261
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,043
Instant demon.

262
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,540
Well, surprise, surprise,

263
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,169
the demons were a no-show.

264
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,672
Although...

265
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,143
...something's happening.

266
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,307
Okay, there's no demon.

267
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,685
It was worth a shot.

268
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,108
So we got in touch
with a demonologist.

269
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,653
And after negotiating a small...
well, smallish... fee,

270
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,322
we've convinced him to
summon a demon for us.

271
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,825
Just a sec.

272
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,036
Hi. Michael King.

273
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,122
This is Jordan.

274
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,040
So why do people
always summon demons,

275
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,959
never angels?

276
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,253
People summon angels all the time.

277
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,005
They just don't want to interfere.

278
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,841
Now, demons, on the other hand,

279
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,260
they're just dying to come here.

280
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,595
It's most tempting to do that
when we're kind of weak,

281
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,097
out of sorts.

282
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,975
Some people meditate for years
to achieve the proper mind set,

283
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,821
but we use tricks...

284
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,074
to get us there faster.

285
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,901
- Uh, grape juice?
- With LSD.

286
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,903
How much LSD?

287
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,031
If you're nervous about this part,

288
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,626
we should stop right now.

289
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,079
There are two prevalent
methods for summoning demons.

290
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,249
The first is by offering the
demon something up front.

291
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,586
A human life, continued servitude,

292
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,588
your own soul.

293
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,882
I don't recommend those paths

294
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,301
as once performed they're
very hard to undo.

295
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,553
The second method entails
creating the type

296
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,639
of frenetic atmosphere
demons are drawn to...

297
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,434
chaos, blood,

298
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,270
sex, violence.

299
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,064
I'll need some of your essence.

300
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,982
Uh, saliva?

301
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,406
Semen.

302
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,454
You're kidding, right?

303
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,950
And I have to get it in this cup?

304
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,370
- Bathroom's right over there.
- Okay.

305
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,706
Ever hear of auto writing?
Scrying? Psychography?

306
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,376
It's how we're going
to pick your demon,

307
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,503
- the one we're going to summon.
- Okay.

308
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,132
Close your eyes.

309
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,769
Now, clear your mind.

310
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,980
Open yourself up to the beyond.

311
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,893
Allow their energy
to flow through you,

312
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,613
to use you.

313
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,442
Let their energy flow.

314
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,287
Breathe.

315
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,541
Breathe.

316
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,827
I'm sorry, I'm not very susceptible
to this kind of stuff.

317
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,581
- I'm sorry.
- You did just fine.

318
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,840
Just a minute here.

319
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,467
So what are we looking
for here? What's this?

320
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,719
To see if the image that you drew

321
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,389
matches up with one of the demons.

322
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,641
And you think that I drew this?

323
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,601
Look.

324
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,229
Daungore.

325
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,440
"Commander of 37 legions.

326
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,984
Seeker of the defenseless,
the weak-spirited,

327
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,902
the nonbeliever.

328
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,447
Known also as the Great Mocker,

329
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,366
Destroyer of Thought,
Breeder of Ants,

330
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,617
Stealer of Children.

331
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,287
He comes accompanied by the
sound of cacophonous music,

332
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,038
staying with the conjurer

333
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,916
until tormentum in dum demens."

334
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,669
It's Latin for

335
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,094
"torture until madness."

336
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,937
I feel pretty weird, man.

337
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,892
Okay, look at this, man.

338
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,603
This look safe to you?
This is fucked up.

339
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,573
This is fucked up.
Look at all this plastic.

340
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,568
They're gonna kill me in here.
That's what they're gonna do.

341
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,778
Oh, my God.

342
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,156
I'm losing my mind.
This is a bad idea.

343
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,036
This is bad. Jordan,
check this out.

344
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,545
Dude, maybe we should get
the fuck out of here.

345
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,426
Oh, my God, what the fuck have
we gotten ourselves into?

346
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,651
Oh, shit.

347
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,982
These are real.

348
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,325
Satan. Lucifer.

349
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,800
Okay, so what are you doing here?

350
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,544
I'm freaking out a little bit.

351
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,342
Oh, God. Oh, God.

352
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,136
Jordan? Jordan, what the
fuck is going on, man?

353
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,305
Something's fucking up the camera.

354
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:41,026
I can't see shit.

355
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,189
Hey, hey, hey!

356
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,942
Michael, are you okay?
Are you all right?

357
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,986
Oh, shit.

358
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,831
She's got a knife.

359
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,292
Get that fucking knife off of him!

360
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,168
Get it off of him!

361
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,629
Jesus Christ!

362
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,420
Well...

363
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,800
that was, like, some kind
of satanic porn shoot.

364
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,228
The smell in there, right?

365
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,388
And you paid him.

366
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,392
Come on, man, shh.
Seriously, turn that off.

367
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:09,147
So you want me to
order you some chili?

368
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,066
Runny eggs?

369
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,193
Or how about a cup of bloody jizz?

370
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,243
Don't. Don't. Don't.
I'm never eating again.

371
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,992
At least enjoy the acid. Ready?

372
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,243
You're running through a forest.
You're running through a forest.

373
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,745
Don't, dude. Don't.
Seriously, come on.

374
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,123
I hate you. Turn it off.

375
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:58,071
So necromancy is considered
the blackest of the black arts.

376
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,073
Why is that?

377
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,201
Well...

378
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:07,622
I think it gets most of its bad rap

379
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,875
because of the method
employed in performing it.

380
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,920
You mean dealing with corpses,
graves, funeral rites.

381
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,172
Right, right. That kind
of creeps people out.

382
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,632
Sure.

383
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,968
But as a mortician,

384
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,312
it's all part of my day job.

385
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,229
And as far as the magic goes...

386
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,144
it's really no different

387
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,855
than what any of these
mediums are doing

388
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,483
except we just employ a
slightly different method

389
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,988
in raising the dead.

390
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,791
Teeth taken from our
little friend over there.

391
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,998
A freshly deceased body

392
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:54,210
works best because the
soul may still be lingering.

393
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,962
Then we can kind of confuse it.

394
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,132
You know, make it think
that it's still alive

395
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,177
and that all it needs to do is just
get back inside of its living body.

396
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,554
Okay.

397
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,515
This is a mild anesthetic

398
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:11,020
similar to Novocain.

399
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,692
- Okay. Doing all right?
- Yeah.

400
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,112
Okay, it'll start to numb
in just a couple minutes.

401
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,573
The more that we can
make you appear

402
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,327
like that body the
soul once inhabited,

403
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,297
the better our chances.

404
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,665
You feel that?

405
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,542
- No.
- Okay.

406
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,878
The astral corpse,

407
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,339
it wants to keep living.

408
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,883
Living is what it knows.

409
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,220
You know? And unless it's
already grown accustomed

410
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,598
to the afterlife,
it's what's normal.

411
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,820
And it's desperate
to cling on to that.

412
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,107
The Sonoran Desert toad

413
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,027
contains dimethyltryptamine,

414
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,655
or DMT,

415
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,877
the most powerful
psychedelic on the planet.

416
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,247
The human body produces DMT.

417
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,374
It's released when we die.

418
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,335
It helps us pass to the other side.

419
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,754
But taking it while
we're still living

420
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,424
simulates a near-death experience.

421
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,769
I'm going to need to let it dry.

422
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,681
Prepare it.

423
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,224
It's gonna take some time.

424
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,773
We need to wait until
it's dark anyhow.

425
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,941
This Novocain is wearing
off on my stomach,

426
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,945
so this is starting to
hurt like a bitch, man.

427
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,781
Oh, there he is.

428
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,576
Hey, sorry we're late. I got
all turned around in here.

429
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,871
Jesus Christ. Did you kill these...

430
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,455
did you kill these things?

431
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,624
The toads, their pain,

432
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,420
agony, it creates
this sort of energy

433
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,423
that draws in the spirits.

434
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,925
Assume the position.

435
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,552
On your back.

436
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,679
Right.

437
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,181
The smell of burning DMT

438
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,901
can be intensely nauseating.

439
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,735
Like burning plastic.

440
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,568
Now, as it takes effect,

441
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,486
the world will shatter

442
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,489
and your body will quickly follow.

443
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,992
You may feel like
you're starting to die,

444
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,661
like you don't know how
to breathe at all.

445
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,538
But it's okay.

446
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,665
You just need to let go

447
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,170
and go with it.

448
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,340
To Almighty God

449
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,845
we commend our brother Michael...

450
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,305
and commit his body to the ground.

451
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,683
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

452
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,061
Roland Sykes.

453
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,396
Roland Sykes,

454
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:04,233
reclaim your physical body.

455
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,486
Take this body. Shit!

456
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,613
- You, hey!
- Get the fuck out of here.

457
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,698
- Get on your knees!
- Michael.

458
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,201
- Where are you?
- They're running.

459
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,414
Oh, fuck me.

460
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,299
He's making a break for it. Hey!

461
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,098
- There he goes!
- Michael.

462
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,112
Hey, you in here?

463
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,152
Michael, you in here?

464
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,610
Michael.

465
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,665
Crawl.

466
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,170
Crawl!

467
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,726
Fuck!

468
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,599
- Crawl.
- What is that?

469
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,852
What the fuck is going on here?

470
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,770
Crawl.

471
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,398
Shit. Michael.

472
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,983
Michael.

473
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,193
Come on, get down, man.

474
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,612
Get down from there.
Let's get out of here.

475
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,286
Come on. Are you okay?

476
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,412
I don't want to be dead.

477
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,998
Get off, Mike!

478
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:45,343
Oh, Jesus.

479
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,965
Jordan? Jordan?

480
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,467
You're tripping
out, man. It's just the drugs.

481
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,390
Dude, just chill.

482
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,139
Oh, no. No, no.

483
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,850
Fuck. She's gone.

484
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,853
Who's gone?

485
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,980
Sam.

486
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,399
I was with her, man.

487
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,485
I was with Sam.

488
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,445
But she's fucking gone.

489
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,074
Come on, let's just
get the fuck out of here.

490
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,658
- Steal it!
- How did we get so lucky?

491
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,994
- Come on!
- I know, she's amazing.

492
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,996
Fishbone, eh.

493
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,706
He doesn't come when
he's called so much.

494
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,000
- Yeah.
- Ew, this is gross now, too.

495
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,595
- Here you go.
- No, no, don't give it to me.

496
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,896
My wife Samantha was...

497
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,308
I mean, I fucking touched her.

498
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,813
You know, and I felt her with...

499
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,358
And she was trying to
tell me something.

500
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,860
It was...

501
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,779
there was all this interference.

502
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,823
It was like static.

503
00:26:56,824 --> 00:27:00,919
And I couldn't make out
what she was saying.

504
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,913
But she was...

505
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,797
Took a shower. Got rid
of these fucking teeth.

506
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,132
Look at this.

507
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:18,511
I feel like I'm still coming down
from the drugs or something.

508
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,888
And that static sound,

509
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,724
it's, like, still there.

510
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,775
I've got to get some sleep.

511
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,524
I can't sleep.

512
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,403
Man, it's like 4:30, 5:00.
Something like that.

513
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,406
Sun's gonna be coming up soon.

514
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,705
I'm just past the point.

515
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,662
And that noise, it's, like,

516
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,582
now that I've noticed it, I'm...

517
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,084
I'm fixated on it.

518
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,460
Hey there.

519
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,588
We're at this reading
by Erica Bell.

520
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,007
She's a relatively
well-known medium.

521
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,968
And then afterwards we
get to interview her.

522
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,928
So come on, let's check it out.

523
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,682
Okay, was there something
with her throat?

524
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,350
Her breathing?

525
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,269
She had esophageal cancer.

526
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,438
She wants you to know she's okay.

527
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,315
She's watching over you.

528
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,610
And you're... no, hang on.

529
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,196
No, wait a minute. Someone
else is butting in here.

530
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,822
Lots of spirits want to talk today.

531
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,699
This is good. Okay.

532
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,284
All right, somewhere over here.

533
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,579
Yes. Yes, this is a
very strong signal.

534
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,122
Female, I think.

535
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,291
She really, really wants to talk.

536
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,251
Right, she passed recently.

537
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,004
Happened kind of quickly,
an accident maybe.

538
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,465
Okay, she has a message.

539
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,218
No, that can't be right.
She wants to...

540
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,553
Michael, listen to me.

541
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,472
You need to...

542
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,017
Whoa, whoa.

543
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,645
Easy, easy, easy. Jesus Christ.

544
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:54,195
What happened?
We're not really sure.

545
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,817
Erica was about to
tell us something

546
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,741
and then she went
into that seizure.

547
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,202
I mean, was she actually
channeling Sam?

548
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,038
Or was that just all
part of her show?

549
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,831
And then the seizure

550
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,334
was just like a strange
coincidence or something.

551
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,752
I don't know.

552
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,213
Dad, Fishy peed on the floor again.

553
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,673
Huh? Okay, baby.

554
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,017
Daddy will take care of
it after dinner, all right?

555
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,763
- Thanks. Oh, fuck!
- Jeez.

556
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,890
Why the fuck would you hand
me something like that?

557
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,850
It's scalding hot.

558
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,353
God damn it.

559
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,697
Michael, that's a salad.

560
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,157
Um, I'm sorry. I'm just...

561
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,076
Daddy's a little tense.
I'm sorry about that.

562
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:50,162
You okay? I scared you.

563
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,792
You okay?

564
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,295
Yeah.

565
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,386
Have some salad, Ellie.

566
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,404
I thought if I went out today

567
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,615
that I could shake
this noise in my head,

568
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,868
that it would just go away.

569
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,044
But now that I'm home
and it's quiet, it's like...

570
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,758
I wish I could describe for you

571
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,551
what this is.

572
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,596
It's this constant barrage,

573
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,806
this cacophony of sound.

574
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,775
It's like...

575
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,438
it's like...

576
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,242
Oh, fuck.

577
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:22,046
Okay, so what's the deal again?

578
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,466
Like I said, it came
out of my mouth.

579
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,135
Uh-huh. Yeah, no.

580
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,804
Why not?

581
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,890
There's multiple layers
of overtone singing.

582
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,600
Overtone? What does that mean?

583
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,143
It's when a singer
manipulates their voice

584
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,062
to have multiple pitches
at the same time.

585
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,315
Okay, good. So then maybe
I did it accidentally.

586
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,861
Well, even if I bought that,
which I don't, there's more.

587
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,322
Here. Let's see.

588
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,491
This is a B2.

589
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,536
- Okay.
- And this is a C#7.

590
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,207
That's a Guinness Book
vocal range right there.

591
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,251
The tape you gave me...

592
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,255
we're talking F#

593
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,349
all the way...

594
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:13,019
E25.

595
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,516
Some of it's not even audible.

596
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,309
Just barely registering
on my stuff.

597
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,395
Let me ask you this. Is it possible

598
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,730
that my vocal cords
could have made this?

599
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,858
Not a chance.

600
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,609
If you're not fucking with me,

601
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,903
then there's something wrong
with the audio in your camera.

602
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,447
A defect or something.

603
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,074
It's not the camera.

604
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,118
Thanks.

605
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,249
Michael.

606
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,460
Michael.

607
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,305
So fricking loud.

608
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,632
Michael?

609
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,010
Hello?

610
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,221
What are you doing? Hey. Michael.

611
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,559
Oh, my God. You scared me.

612
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,478
Let's go. I've been calling you.

613
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,606
Dinner's ready.

614
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,397
Chronic ringing of the ears.

615
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,941
It's a very common condition.
It's called tinnitus.

616
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:32,027
- You should see an internist.
- I did. I did.

617
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,029
He gave me a clean bill of health.

618
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,698
Said that it must be psychosomatic,

619
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,043
that I should see a psychiatrist,
which is why I'm here.

620
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,205
I understand, Michael,
that your wife died recently.

621
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,332
6 months ago, yeah.

622
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,209
Left you alone with a little girl.

623
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,129
Ellie, uh-huh.

624
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,548
You might be going through
some extreme stress

625
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,843
trying to deal with thoughts,
feelings, emotions,

626
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:59,555
things that consciously you
might not think you can handle.

627
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,641
And so then they
become side effects.

628
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,353
All right, so you think
you can, I don't know,

629
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,481
help me come to grips with
this if that's what it is?

630
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,650
Breathe.

631
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,653
Good.

632
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,698
Let your thoughts, your conscious,

633
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:20,075
drift away.

634
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,170
Nice and easy.

635
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,291
We're traveling deep into
your subconscious, Michael.

636
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,545
Deep down inside.

637
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,547
Michael?

638
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,221
Are you there? Are you with me?

639
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,054
Yes.

640
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,889
How are you feeling?

641
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,308
- Fine.
- Good.

642
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,853
That sound in your
head, is it still there?

643
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,563
Yes.

644
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:53,025
- Okay.
- But there's something else.

645
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,069
What?

646
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,446
I know what the sound is.

647
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,365
What is it, Michael?

648
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,116
Voices.

649
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,203
- Voices?
- Yes.

650
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,832
What are they saying?

651
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:10,084
So many things.

652
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,252
Anything in particular?

653
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,089
- Yes.
- What?

654
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,926
They're saying you will...

655
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,929
What? You will what, Michael?

656
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,188
You will...

657
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,528
Michael?

658
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,857
Crawl.

659
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,109
Michael, are you okay?

660
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,485
Michael.

661
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,612
Hey! What the fuck?

662
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,036
What the fuck is going on?

663
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,788
The camera jumped out of my hands.

664
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,666
You made some weird voice.

665
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,001
Bullshit.

666
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,962
It's all on the camera.

667
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:58,590
And then you were talking about
all the sounds in your head,

668
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,469
they were voices.

669
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:07,233
Look, I know this is none
of my business, but...

670
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,230
you think Sam would want
you to be doing this?

671
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:20,195
So Jordan officially
left the project.

672
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,573
Is something really
happening to me?

673
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,533
I mean, I'm physically exhausted.

674
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,952
I'm drained.

675
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,996
And I was hypnotized, you know?

676
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:33,751
Is it really that surprising that
I spoke in some weird voice?

677
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:37,472
I mean, I think that Jordan just
got startled and threw the camera.

678
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,341
That's what it looked like.

679
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,344
I don't know.

680
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,308
Okay, I'm back.

681
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,268
And this thing going on in my head,

682
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,864
it's evolving.

683
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,275
It's like I can hear this...

684
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,652
mumbling now.

685
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:04,072
Like my subconscious

686
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,416
is trying to talk
to me or something.

687
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,789
And if I concentrate...

688
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,795
I can almost tell what it's saying.

689
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,685
Must have flown into the window.

690
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,229
Crowley loves you.

691
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:40,192
Hey, sweetie. Did that
noise wake you up?

692
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,653
That was just the window. It broke.

693
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,282
It was just the window. It's okay.

694
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,575
What is it? You all right?

695
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,046
- The monster.
- Monster?

696
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,257
Oh, from your dream.

697
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,753
Okay. Okay. Let's see.

698
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,964
I'll tell you what.

699
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,341
How about you go back to sleep,

700
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,760
and then maybe Daddy will
show up in your dream

701
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,512
and then he can chase
that monster away.

702
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,180
How's that?

703
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,524
You can't.

704
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,769
Really? Why is that?

705
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,938
I saw the monster.

706
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,523
Well, that's good.

707
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,992
What did this monster look like?

708
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,950
It's you, Daddy.

709
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,540
It's me?

710
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,955
It's just a bad dream.
You know that, right?

711
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,749
And Daddy would never
hurt you, okay?

712
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,298
No matter what.

713
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,007
Why don't you go get Fishbone

714
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,593
and go get back in bed, okay?

715
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,428
I can't find her.

716
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,971
Come on, girl.

717
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,065
What you doing, Fishy?

718
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,860
Let's see, that bird should
be right about here.

719
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:08,285
Huh. That's weird.

720
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,211
Fishbone.

721
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,756
Is that you, girl?

722
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,336
Oh, where the fuck are you?

723
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,524
What the fuck?

724
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,907
Whoa, Jesus Christ!

725
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,241
Fuck.

726
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,199
What the fuck is that?

727
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,702
Ellie! Beth!

728
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,876
Ellie! Beth!

729
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,302
Jesus. Michael. What the hell?

730
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,089
What are you doing? She's asleep.

731
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,508
What are you doing?

732
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,677
Michael, what is wrong?

733
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,220
We'll find the dog, okay?

734
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,931
Just relax.

735
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:19,902
Look, will you please
stop acting like this?

736
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,148
I'm sorry. I'm just...

737
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,778
You're just acting,
like, crazy, so...

738
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,245
- You all right?
- Are you all right?

739
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,078
- Yeah.
- You look like shit.

740
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,579
Have you slept lately?

741
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,253
Oh, God.

742
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,877
I just can't seem to wind down.

743
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,255
Hold on.

744
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,384
Here. Take two of these.

745
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,553
- Sleeping pills?
- Yup.

746
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,680
Then you will sleep, believe me.

747
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,932
Feel better in the morning.

748
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,561
Thank you. Good night.

749
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,625
I thought if I
got a good night's sleep

750
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,712
that this would end.

751
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:37,717
But these voices,
they're not going away.

752
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,145
I need to confront this.

753
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,444
So...

754
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,789
are you real?

755
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,376
Or am I going insane?

756
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,466
Neither is an appealing
choice, but...

757
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,634
I suppose one of them must be true.

758
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,680
I guess I'd rather...

759
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,431
you were real.

760
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:46,368
Okay. Okay. What if...

761
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,621
what if I said...

762
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:52,625
what if I said that you've
proved your existence?

763
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,511
That I believed in you?

764
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,015
I believe in you.

765
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,135
Would you just...

766
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,559
would you leave?

767
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,077
No.

768
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,079
We're gonna fuck you up.

769
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:41,631
Hi. Oh, is Father Gibbons here?

770
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,300
I'm sorry, no.

771
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,599
Kill her.

772
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:49,139
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Listen, it is urgent.

773
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,849
I need to speak to Father
Gibbons right now.

774
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,392
- And you are?
- Just get Father...

775
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,935
I'm Michael King. I'm Michael King.

776
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,520
I interviewed him and
I need to talk...

777
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,938
- I need to talk to him right...
- I'm sorry.

778
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,190
Father Gibbons passed
a few days ago.

779
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,943
He's... he's... okay.

780
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,611
Listen, I need an exorcism.

781
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,946
- An exorcism?
- Yeah.

782
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,574
- The Church doesn't do that.
- No, you do it.

783
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:09,659
I know you do. Father Gibbons
told me that you do.

784
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,244
I need an exorcism, please.

785
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,039
He was rather out of
sorts towards the end.

786
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,749
I'm sorry if he misled you.

787
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,375
He didn't mislead me. I need help.

788
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,502
Excuse me. There's nothing
we can do for you.

789
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,796
- Sorry, we can't help you.
- Father, I need your help.

790
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,923
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

791
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,597
Okay. Okay.

792
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,475
Excuse me a moment.

793
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:36,144
- You can't come here.
- How do I get rid of it?

794
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,480
- How do I make it go away?
- What are you talking about?

795
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,316
I mean this thing. This
thing in my fucking head.

796
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,318
I warned you something
like this might happen.

797
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,447
Now I need you to get the fuck out.

798
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,335
Hey.

799
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,045
What the fuck have you done to me?

800
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:05,340
- What is this thing?
- What? I don't understand.

801
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,717
Something's got a hold of me.
You did something.

802
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,969
- You summoned something.
- No, man, it's not for real.

803
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,888
- It's all for fun.
- Bullshit, you're lying.

804
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,476
Get up. Get up.

805
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,770
Easy. Please. Please help me.

806
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,607
- Now get out of here.
- Please. I need your help.

807
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,359
I really need to talk to her.

808
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,153
I need to come in and
I need to see her.

809
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,530
But isn't that what
she's supposed to do

810
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:31,157
is help somebody that's in a
situation like what I'm in?

811
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,493
I'm hearing shit and
I'm seeing shit now.

812
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,453
Listen, I'm losing my fucking mind.

813
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,206
Would you please just tell Dr. Cox
that I need to talk to her?

814
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,875
Can you do that for me? Oh!

815
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,253
You don't know how fucking
desperate I am here, okay?

816
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,883
You're supposed to help people.
Well, I need your fucking help!

817
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,228
I don't know what to fucking do.

818
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,106
Dad.

819
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,863
Can I play my game?

820
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,125
Tell me...

821
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,956
do you miss your mommy?

822
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,425
Yeah.

823
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,549
You can be with her, you know.

824
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,765
Hey, Ellie, come on.

825
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,104
Let's go get a bath.

826
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,352
So long.

827
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,105
Ladybug.

828
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,448
Come on, let's go.

829
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,958
I don't feel like myself at all

830
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,418
anymore.

831
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,837
I'm starting to have
these crazy thoughts.

832
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,217
I feel compelled.

833
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:57,262
Like I have to. Like I
have to fucking do it.

834
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,620
Eyes are throbbing like mad.

835
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:06,164
Can you see this?

836
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:09,542
Aw, it hurts like hell.

837
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,628
I'm fucking slipping.

838
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,921
What? Oh, my God.

839
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,174
No, God damn it, no!

840
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,263
What the fuck?

841
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,766
What the fuck is that?

842
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,269
Oh, my God.

843
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:33,734
What happened? Beth? Ellie?

844
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,444
Fuck!

845
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,674
Ellie! Ellie!

846
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,926
- Crowley loves you.
- Ellie.

847
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:02,136
Ellie.

848
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,805
Is that Fishy?

849
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:06,474
- No, baby.
- Are you okay?

850
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:09,444
- Ellie, sweetheart.
- No, no.

851
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,896
Beth, you don't think...

852
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,523
Beth, I didn't.

853
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,983
- I don't want to leave Fishy!
- Ellie.

854
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,653
- Let me go!
- Ellie.

855
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,872
Oh, God.

856
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,533
Oh.

857
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,332
What have I done?

858
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,877
Fish.

859
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,877
You...

860
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,879
you don't have power over me.

861
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,798
You don't.

862
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:41,050
You think you do, but you don't.

863
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,010
This isn't what I wanted.

864
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,387
This isn't what I wanted at all.

865
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,767
I'm sorry, Sam.

866
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,812
You can't make me do anything.

867
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,148
Shh. Couldn't make me lower.

868
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:58,619
You are just in my fucking
head. Get out of my head!

869
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,069
I thought I almost killed Ellie.

870
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,399
Fishbone was Sam's dog.

871
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,995
Fuck.

872
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,406
Beth and Ellie,

873
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,242
they're staying with one of
Beth's friends for a few days.

874
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,912
It's getting too hard
to fucking concentrate.

875
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,750
Quiet!

876
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,003
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

877
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,422
Stop saying that, God damn it!

878
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,674
Shit! Stop!

879
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,093
"I command you, unclean spirit.

880
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,222
You shall not be emboldened
to harm this creature of God.

881
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,682
You shall not harm him
or those he touches.

882
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,143
I command you, release this body.

883
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,365
Release this body..."

884
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,400
"Turn back this evil upon my soul.

885
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,745
I beseech you, Lord.
I beseech you."

886
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,658
Burn! Burn!

887
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,285
- Burn!
- Fuck! God damn it!

888
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,497
You can't have this body.

889
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:37,046
No! No, God damn it!

890
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,966
Fuck! Fuck!

891
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:52,640
God, please!

892
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,289
I've tried everything.

893
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,834
Protective spells, banishments,

894
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,714
charms, every
incantation I can find.

895
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,674
Nothing's worked.

896
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:13,351
The more I try and fight
it, the more it takes over.

897
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,062
Forcing me to do things.

898
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,395
Laughing at me.

899
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,149
It's fucking laughing at me.

900
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,742
You'd think this
really hurts, right?

901
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,203
Funny thing is

902
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,672
I can hardly feel it.

903
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,754
It's getting harder and
harder to feel anything.

904
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,091
It's like...

905
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,224
none of this is real anymore.

906
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:04,444
It's not real.

907
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,461
Nothing is real.

908
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,427
See this?

909
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,684
Look at that.

910
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,779
No matter how many
times I kill it...

911
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,899
ah, there.

912
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,821
Oh, yeah. See this? See?

913
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:57,417
Another one. Okay.

914
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,705
I've been doing this all day long.

915
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,832
Look at that bastard.

916
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,334
You son of a bitch.

917
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,587
Fuck. Another one.

918
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,515
God damn it.

919
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,857
If I let it crawl on my
body, there's only one.

920
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,310
The second I kill it,

921
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:27,030
another one shows up.

922
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:33,235
The girl.

923
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,571
I know, okay? I know what you want!

924
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,951
We want the girl.

925
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,286
- You can't have her.
- We can make you do it.

926
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,580
- You can't have her.
- Someone else.

927
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,541
- Someone else.
- Okay. Okay.

928
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:51,212
I'll do it. I'll do it.

929
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:53,047
But you can't have Ellie.

930
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,965
You hear me?

931
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,844
You can't have Ellie.

932
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,110
Kill her. Now. Kill her.

933
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,445
Kill her. Kill her.

934
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,620
Kill her!

935
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,996
We want you to kill her.

936
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,970
Kill.

937
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,314
Kill him.

938
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,994
Sorry, Ellie.

939
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:49,663
I just... I couldn't do it.

940
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,666
I just...

941
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,711
I have to fucking get some sleep.

942
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:58,214
Goddamn rest.

943
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,175
You're not going anywhere!

944
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,010
Okay, we're not going anywhere.

945
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:05,054
We're fuckin' sleeping.

946
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,723
No, we're not going out.

947
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:17,280
Yes, you will!

948
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,665
What the fuck?

949
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,424
Oh, no.

950
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,080
Michael.

951
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:58,255
- Jordan, I'm in here.
- Michael?

952
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,712
- Michael.
- Yeah.

953
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:04,506
Jesus Christ, what the
fuck is going on in here?

954
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,476
Your place is a dis... Jesus.

955
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,642
Key is over there. Do you
mind getting it for me?

956
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,479
Oh, fuck.

957
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,066
We need to get you some
serious help, all right?

958
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:25,611
You gonna check into a facility?

959
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,571
I'm serious, man. If I unlock you,

960
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,996
we are going there right now.

961
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,204
Answer the fucking...
what am I doing?

962
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,390
Jordan?

963
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,702
Oh! Oh, fuck!

964
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,414
There was a being

965
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,509
inside a light and...

966
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:25,629
I don't know if it
was an angel or...

967
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,633
 God.

968
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:35,398
It asked me if I was
prepared to move on.

969
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:42,026
All I needed to do was let go.

970
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,911
And I wanted to.

971
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,782
But I held on because

972
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,201
I needed to come back and tell you

973
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,621
that everything was gonna be okay,

974
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,124
that I'm okay.

975
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:07,255
Because...

976
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:09,965
the next time that it happens,

977
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,640
I'm gonna let go.

978
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,349
Michael, I know you have
a hard time believing...

979
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,313
but it's real.

980
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,987
I know that now.

981
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,528
I love you, Michael.

982
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,614
I always will.

983
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:38,368
There's a few things I
need to say to Ellie.

984
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:41,497
Why the fuck didn't
I listen to you?

985
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:44,333
My little ladybug.

986
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,211
So sad I'm not gonna
see you grow up

987
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:50,005
- into the beautiful...
- Fuck!

988
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:54,556
stunning little angel
you already are.

989
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,845
- Please just know that I'm with you.
- No! You can't.

990
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,181
- I'm always there.
- You can't have this body.

991
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,642
It'll be okay.

992
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,145
It's gonna be okay.

993
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,065
Kill me!

994
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:13,162
Fuck. Here we go.

995
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,231
These cameras,

996
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,450
this film...

997
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,861
it's proof.

998
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:58,699
I hope someone finds it

999
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,794
and uses it to show others.

1000
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,664
Tell my story, please.

1001
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:08,714
Someone tell my story.

1002
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,881
Tell my daughter...

1003
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,551
tell my daughter

1004
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:20,726
her daddy never meant for
any of this to happen.

1005
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:25,400
Tell her that... tell her
that Daddy loves her.

1006
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:31,528
Tell her... tell her
her daddy loves...

1007
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:39,740
You ought to kill her.

1008
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:42,826
- No. No.
- Do it.

1009
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,412
No! Leave me alone.

1010
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:48,790
Why? We're having fun.

1011
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,614
I love you.

1012
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,199
Okay, now go...

1013
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,950
Fishy, what are
you doing? Get out of that.

1014
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,828
- That's not yours.
- Oh, no, he ate all the popcorn.

1015
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,122
- Baby. Come here.
- That dog is like a disposal.

1016
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,501
Now puke. Puke. Give it back.

1017
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,294
Put your fingers down his throat.

1018
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,342
Mouth to mouth.

1019
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,855
We're together now, Michael.

1020
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,525
Isn't it wonderful?

1021
01:09:56,526 --> 01:10:00,451
I had it wrong, didn't I?

1022
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:11,415
The interference, the chattering,

1023
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,543
the noise...

1024
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,670
those weren't demons.

1025
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,673
That wasn't you.

1026
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:26,555
Those were angels.

1027
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,309
Something.

1028
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,852
Trying to...

1029
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,396
trying to warn me.

1030
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:40,861
Trying to keep me from hearing

1031
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:43,456
the real voices...

1032
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,204
the real singing.

1033
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:55,333
Because once you hear it,

1034
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,883
you can never stop listening.

1035
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,599
I'm gonna go get Crowley.

1036
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,898
Michael?

1037
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:58,980
Oh, my God. What the...?

1038
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,649
Michael.

1039
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,734
Michael, you're scaring me.

1040
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,986
Michael, it's me.
It's Beth. Please.

1041
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,179
Daddy?

1042
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,931
Let's play.

1043
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:35,684
No.

1044
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:38,854
Ellie, run.

1045
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,982
Run from Daddy. Go.

1046
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,828
Ellie, I'm coming to get you.

1047
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,866
We're gonna rip her head off.

1048
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:52,994
No.

1049
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:56,162
Run, Ellie. Go.

1050
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:59,963
We're gonna eat her, Michael.

1051
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:40,215
Where are you hiding, ladybug?

1052
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,836
Crowley loves you.

1053
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:51,098
No. No.

1054
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:03,396
Ellie.

1055
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:08,410
Yes.

1056
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:11,785
Ladybug.

1057
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,367
Where are you?

1058
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:19,623
Daddy's coming to find you.

1059
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,421
Crowley loves you.

1060
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:47,362
No. Daddy!

1061
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:53,952
Sam. Is that you?

1062
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:01,167
Go quickly.

1063
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:05,088
No, Daddy.

1064
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,424
It's okay.

1065
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:29,320
It's gonna be okay.

1066
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,578
- Get her, Fishbone.
- He's coming. Run.

1067
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:43,580
Get her. Oh, God.

1068
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,999
Careful, baby.

1069
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,168
Your turn.

1070
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:50,462
What is your New Year's resolution?

1071
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:52,422
To make a documentary
about this family

1072
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,007
so that I can show the whole world

1073
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,759
what a lucky guy I am.

1074
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,844
- You are a lucky guy.
- That's right.

1075
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,804
And I thank God every day.

1076
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,431
If only you believed in God.

1077
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:03,183
Yeah, that'd probably
help a little bit.

1078
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:04,642
Oh, crap. You know what?

1079
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,770
I didn't put change in that meter.
We're gonna get a ticket.

1080
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:08,855
- Dad, can you help me?
- What's up?

1081
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:10,231
- Here, I got it.
- You sure?

1082
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,816
- Yup.
- Thanks, babe.

1083
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:13,109
Of course.

1084
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:15,195
Come on, get it. Come get it.

1085
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:17,197
Fetch! We're too good.

1086
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,575
Atta boy.

1087
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,750
Sam!

1088
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,379
Help!

1089
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,882
- Somebody help!
- Mommy!

1090
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:16,923
<i>I can taste the power</i>

1091
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:20,510
<i>Now there's something real</i>

1092
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,930
<i>Something real to feed me</i>

1093
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:27,892
<i>Inside your naked world</i>

1094
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:31,479
<i>Your body works forever</i>

1095
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:35,483
<i>I'm electric with your tears</i>

1096
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:39,195
<i>Your soul came into the darkness</i>

1097
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:43,291
<i>Of everlasting fear</i>

1098
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:47,662
<i>Why don't you bow down now?</i>

1099
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:51,416
<i>Make me feel like I'm someone</i>

1100
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:55,044
<i>Bow down now, roll over</i>

1101
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:59,470
<i>Make me feel like I'm someone</i>

1102
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:09,434
<i>God made you to serve me</i>

1103
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:13,229
<i>I know I've lost control</i>

1104
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:17,358
<i>She's the liquid flesh you feel</i>

1105
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,904
<i>Fills your empty soul</i>

1106
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:24,532
<i>The master's love is torture</i>

1107
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:28,203
<i>As your innocence knows the game</i>

1108
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:31,998
<i>So what you can't remember</i>

1109
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:36,174
<i>Is working for your shame</i>

1110
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:40,506
<i>Why don't you bow down now?</i>

1111
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:44,260
<i>Make me feel like I'm someone</i>

1112
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:48,014
<i>Bow down now, roll over</i>

1113
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:52,315
<i>Make me feel like I'm someone</i>

1114
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:09,160
<i>Give me</i>

1115
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:12,247
<i>What I need to</i>

1116
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,791
<i>Give you</i>

1117
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,709
<i>Give me</i>

1118
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:20,088
<i>What I need to</i>

1119
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:22,048
<i>Give you</i>

1120
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:25,927
<i>Why don't you bow down now?</i>

1121
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:29,555
<i>Make me feel like I'm someone</i>

1122
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:33,393
<i>Bow down now, roll over</i>

1123
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:37,230
<i>Make me feel like I'm someone</i>

1124
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:41,025
<i>Bow down now, roll over</i>

1125
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:44,737
<i>Make me feel like I'm someone</i>

1126
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:48,533
<i>Bow down now, roll over</i>

1127
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:52,370
<i>Make me feel like I'm someone</i>

1128
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:56,082
<i>Bow down now, bow down now</i>

1129
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,917
<i>Bow down now</i>

1130
01:19:57,918 --> 01:20:00,921
<i>Bow down now.</i>
