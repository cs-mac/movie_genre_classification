<b><i>WHiTE</b></i>

7
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,300
Wow! "Pure" is better than ever

8
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,000
Now, we have 4 lovely angels
aiming for number 1

9
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,200
Who are they?

10
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,710
Let's call them out together

11
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,500
"Pink Dolls"!

12
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,200
I'm the youngest, <b><i>A-rang</b></i>

13
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,300
I'm the lead vocalist, <b><i>Jenny</b></i>

14
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,610
I'm in charge of dance and rap
I'm <b><i>Shin-ji</b></i>

15
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,210
I'm the team leader, <b><i>Eun-ju</b></i>

16
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,520
Please support us, the "Pink Dolls"!

17
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,380
Thank you. We came first

18
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,280
We'll work even harder
We love you, thank you everyone

19
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,290
We were just side-kicks
How annoying!

20
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,490
'Survival Challenge' is starting soon
Looks like "Pure" will be cast

21
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,690
We'll get another chance

22
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,600
She's so relaxed

23
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,690
Because she's old and experienced

24
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,300
She almost knocked me over
out there

25
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,510
No-one even visits our website
or uploads videos of us now

26
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,810
Another chance? As if.

27
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,410
We'll just appear on some
old pop show

28
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,320
This is what happens when
your agency is hopeless

29
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,020
Do you think it's the agency's fault
your ranking dropped?

30
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,430
Is that all you can think of?

31
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,830
Go turn it off

32
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,830
Yes

33
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,730
Do you think
they became stars easily?

34
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,340
They worked their asses off to
get to the top

35
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,350
We're moving tomorrow
Pack up their belongings

36
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,340
Yes, Mr. Choi

37
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,850
Let's go, girls

38
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,360
Really? We have to move again?

39
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,360
It better not be any worse

40
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,560
- Let's go
- I don't want to move

41
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,480
Let's look around

42
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,390
Wow! This is so cool!

43
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,390
What is this?
Where did she get the money?

44
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,490
The building was empty after a fire
The boss got it at a good price

45
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,790
Now all we need is a song & dance

46
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,990
Wait! Is it 2 people to a room?

47
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,000
Sure

48
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,400
Eun-ju! Leave it to me

49
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,910
It's okay, I can do it

50
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,500
If you say so

51
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,900
This rehearsal studio is really
something!

52
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,590
Why are you so shocked?

53
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,590
- I'm all right
- Sit down

54
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,690
So... How is it?

55
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,790
The girls are a handful, right?

56
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,900
You're the eldest & team leader
You have to control them

57
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,910
You used to be a back dancer
You knew it wouldn't be easy

58
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,210
Do you like the studio?

59
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,810
Yes, thank you

60
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,510
Don't thank me

61
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,520
Someone paid for it
His father owned this place

62
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,720
His father passed away in a fire

63
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,320
Anyway

64
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,030
Who do you think gave this place
to us?

65
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,830
Mr. Choi

66
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,830
He's gotten us this new studio
Now is the perfect timing

67
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,340
I don't even know his face

68
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,530
Eun-ju...

69
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,840
You want to
achieve your dreams too, right?

70
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,140
Don't think too hard about it

71
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,650
You've hit bottom, work your way
up now

72
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,850
What's that?

73
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,960
A music video?

74
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,370
The chorus is quite addictive

75
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,570
You've never heard it before, right?

76
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,170
There are tons of songs floating around
It's just another song with no owner

77
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,280
Okay... Are you sure?

78
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,870
Start working on it

79
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,680
Who cares who owns the song?
Finders keepers

80
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,820
- What do you think?
- It's pretty good

81
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,410
I will brush up on the original

82
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,620
Okay then

83
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,020
Mr. Lee's working on the arrangement
We'll have the MR tomorrow

84
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,430
Prepare for next week's showcase

85
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,620
Tell Sun-ye to come for the doubling

86
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,640
This showcase is our big break

87
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,730
It's our last chance to make it

88
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,840
The dance is a little strange

89
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,640
It's not even dancing...
Just gestures

90
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,740
So typical I knew the studio was
too good to be true

91
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,650
What is she doing?

92
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,150
Hey...

93
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,250
Eun-ju..

94
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,870
Do you like this dance?

95
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,070
Well... I think it's pretty good

96
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,370
The best part is
when you roll the neck

97
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,670
Best part?

98
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,470
She used to be a back dancer
She knows more about dance than we do

99
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,380
Why not just be a back dancer then?

100
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,680
Why come here and
raise our team's average age?

101
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,480
Debuting late
is nothing to be proud of

102
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,190
Jenny, A-rang

103
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,090
Watch what you say
I'm doing my best too

104
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,790
You're doing your best?

105
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,800
Talk about pathetic

106
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,700
Go and ask your sponsor to give us
more money to make up a new dance

107
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,400
That's how you can help us

108
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,210
I thought you went & meet him
to get us this great new studio

109
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,110
I thought
you'd finally come around

110
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,910
Eun-ju

111
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,310
I think you're wrong

112
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,230
That's not rolling
How can you roll the neck?

113
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,720
Eun-ju...
I think you're really pathetic

114
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,330
What do you think about when
you dance in front of people?

115
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:57,540
I'm going to die under that crowd...
That's what I think when I dance

116
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,450
I'm not going on stage with
this stupid dance

117
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,340
Hey! We have to rehearse!

118
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,860
Let's get started practicing then

119
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,160
Shoulders, chin

120
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,770
Karaoke room in an hour
- Eun-ju -

121
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:39,380
I love you, so I cry
I miss you, so I cry

122
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:45,590
My love who left me
That painful love

123
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,190
You left me, so I cry

124
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,300
Geez... What's with the sad face?

125
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,400
Is something wrong?

126
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,010
There are so many...
All these people were singers

127
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,410
Where are they all now?

128
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,920
Singers are just a seasonal act

129
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,910
Especially idols

130
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,220
Sun-ye

131
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,230
Why did you give it up?

132
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,130
Why do you think?
My bodywas hurt...

133
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,330
My heart was hurt too and
nothing worked out for me

134
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,430
Why?

135
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,640
Should I quit too?

136
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,430
Hey! Did they give you a hard time
again?

137
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,250
If you're going to keep that up...

138
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,540
Just form a group with me

139
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,450
What?

140
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,850
The LaLa Sisters?

141
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,050
Old pop specialists

142
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,050
A female duo

143
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,260
"White"... You're going to be
in a showcase?

144
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,170
Yes

145
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,870
I think it has potential

146
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,970
I've got a good feeling about it

147
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,980
Eun-ju

148
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,080
You've come too far to
give it up now

149
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,480
Let's just give it one more try

150
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,280
If it doesn't work out, then
we'll be the LaLa Sisters

151
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,120
All the journalists are here

152
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,620
Cancel?

153
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:05,520
Saved you from dancing at
school festivals & now, how dare you?

154
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,040
Get ready, girls

155
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,540
Sorry! My lesson finished late

156
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,140
I was just about to panic
Hurry up and get ready

157
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,770
Jenny, are you all right?

158
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,170
A-rang, don't keep touching your eye
You look fine

159
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,270
Shin-ji, don't get nervous

160
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,680
I'm going to perform
as though this was our last stage

161
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,780
We've already hit bottom

162
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,580
Let's get out there and perform
like crazy

163
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,990
People always said I was intense
Let's do it

164
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,390
Shin-ji, you too

165
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,990
Or we'll just lose to "Pure" again

166
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,010
This is it. Let's do it

167
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,820
"Pink Dolls"?
What brings them here?

168
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,620
This showcase sucks

169
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,310
Prepare for the doubling

170
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,220
1, 2, 3

171
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,680
Hot showcase! "Pink Dolls"

172
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,790
"Pink Dolls"
Shin-ji's power dance

173
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,530
I have some good news for you

174
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,230
Your online fan club surpassed
200,000

175
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,740
Bravo

176
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,740
- Take good care of the website
- Yes

177
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,750
You were asked to star in a film
but I turned it down

178
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,440
You can earn that money at 2 shows
Why waste 6 months shooting?

179
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,250
But I said yes to 'Survival Challenge'

180
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,260
Then we get to see Jun-ho?

181
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,450
Be quiet

182
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,650
That's not all

183
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,360
We're negotiating some
TV commercials

184
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,360
But there is a condition

185
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,460
Top of the Music Fever Charts

186
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,070
I think the 200th episode is perfect

187
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,270
It's around the time when
mid-terms end

188
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,080
Look at the time already
What's next?

189
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:54,880
The fitting session

190
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,880
Fitting? Let's decide
who'll stand in the center too

191
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,880
Center?

192
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,280
Yes

193
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,480
Don't we all sing a part each?

194
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,990
We still need a main vocalist
The original song was a solo too

195
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,390
The song's hard,
so it needs a good singer

196
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,100
The prettiest girl should be
in the middle

197
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,510
My ephidrosis is working up again
It's worse when I'm nervous

198
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,710
Hurry up

199
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,420
Do you think the center will go to
the best vocalist?

200
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,610
I guess so

201
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,520
It's your 2nd album, so the
song's important

202
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,530
Who told you to go first?
You're not even the main!

203
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,470
I think A-rang suits this style best

204
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,970
A-rang, stand in the middle

205
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,970
The center should be pretty

206
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,780
It's the 2nd album.
They should be sexy, not cute

207
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,480
Plus, the song's hard to sing

208
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,490
This time, Jenny Stand in the middle

209
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,000
Go with this

210
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,110
Okay! Setting number 2!

211
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,510
Jenny, get readyfor a solo shot

212
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,920
Not as loud as the center

213
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,420
Really good

214
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,120
Look daring

215
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,030
Okay, that's nice

216
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,030
Who sang this?

217
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,940
That's quite high

218
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,740
That's just the accompaniment

219
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,760
She's good

220
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,560
I didn't know
her voice was that high

221
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,470
Jenny, make it a little gentler
Can you raise it to a nasal tone?

222
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,980
I can still hear a head voice
Let's try it again

223
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,890
No-one's doubling, right?

224
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,690
I feel like
someone's singing along

225
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,100
Jenny, let's try it again Play

226
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,500
If hertone's that high,
it will drain out the other parts

227
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,590
Just play it

228
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,900
All she does is screech

229
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,810
The hook part's a solo too

230
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,110
It's the main single
You should divide it up a little

231
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,010
Why? I just want to give the
main voice more impact

232
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,020
If Jenny's too overpowering,
the other girls will drown out

233
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,920
Let them have other parts then
Give them the rap and hook

234
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,620
Eun-ju...

235
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,830
Sorry I was so mean to you

236
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,940
It's a little hot in here, don't you think?

237
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:19,140
Jenny, are you ready? 3... 2, 1, go!

238
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,080
Those girls are crazy

239
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,590
Wait... Where's Jenny?

240
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,090
In the studio, I guess
The boss is working her hard

241
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,290
You two go ahead and sleep

242
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,170
Jenny...

243
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,960
It's late. Rehearse tomorrow

244
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,870
Jenny..?

245
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,210
Jenny

246
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,420
Jenny?

247
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,020
Jenny!

248
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,930
Help! Help!

249
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,730
Is anyone there?

250
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,930
Help her! She's dying!

251
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,760
Eun-ju, it's not your fault

252
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,860
She was hallucinating from the
herbal medicine.  Keep smiling

253
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,870
Talk about trying to stand out

254
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,270
Ouch... My wrist hurts

255
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,070
Can you do the rest?

256
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,370
Yes, okay

257
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,170
5 mins left  Fans can enter now

258
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,400
What do you think?

259
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,500
About Jenny

260
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,910
She took that medicine all the time
for her ephidrosis

261
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,010
Why did it act up just now?

262
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,310
Don't you think it's strange?

263
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,810
I don't know. It's side-effects...

264
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,010
Why now?

265
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,110
Why did she experience side-effects
after she became the lead singer?

266
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,330
What are you trying to say?

267
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,430
Maybe...

268
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,330
Someone played a prank on her

269
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,540
Put something in her medicine...

270
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,240
Go to bed. We have to rehearse
group dance moves tomorrow

271
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,140
I guess it wouldn't be you

272
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,250
As we all know you're...
Really weak-hearted

273
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,420
Bad video of Jenny

274
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,130
You called me here to look at this?

275
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,540
I have a lesson tomorrow morning

276
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,940
Doesn't it look weird?

277
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,050
Maybe the flash went off

278
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,450
Or someone photoshopped it

279
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,950
It's all because of stress

280
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,150
Jenny was stressed out being
the main....

281
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,350
So she ate a month's supply
of medicine in one day?

282
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,660
I hope it's not related

283
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,560
Don't worry about it

284
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,760
It's just a bunch of young anti-fans

285
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,570
No... I mean "White", the song

286
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,990
Wow

287
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,300
You really have
that neck roll going

288
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,300
The neck roll's the best part

289
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,800
You all saw Shin-ji, right?

290
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,000
Okay then

291
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,000
We're going to set group dance today
Tomorrow, you'll dance in heels

292
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,810
Let's all try it

293
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,010
Shin-ji, you should be the main
I'll talk to the boss about it

294
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,210
Our music video's going to rock
Let's go

295
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,810
The first pose is different now
Do you think it's okay?

296
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,820
The new version's better
Let's all try after Shin-ji

297
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,620
The dance is after the chorus
I should be in the center

298
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,320
Why should you be in the center?
Can you sing? Can you dance?

299
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,730
Just stick to your own part

300
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,740
Let's try it 5, 6, 7, 8

301
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,860
Shin-ji, fill-in for "Pure"

302
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,850
Delete it right now!

303
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,860
Geez

304
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,150
What's with you?

305
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,760
Delete what?

306
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,270
Don't pretend you don't know
Delete it right now

307
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,270
Do you have proof that I did it?

308
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,280
You act tough & cool all by yourself
But you're nothing

309
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,470
You think you're so good

310
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:21,380
I've been nice to you, so you think
you've got nothing to be scared about?

311
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,390
If you don't delete it by tomorrow...

312
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,580
Stop it!

313
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,080
What are you two doing?

314
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,690
Yu Shin-ji, go outside

315
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,700
Dance all you want

316
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,710
There are photos of you all over
the web

317
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,610
I uploaded those pictures! I did!

318
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,710
What's wrong with you both?

319
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,710
She did it first
Some kind of chemical...

320
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,420
The doctor said the
pus in my eyes is side effect...

321
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,110
...from the cosmetics

322
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,320
See? There's something in here

323
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,920
In here

324
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,140
Here as well

325
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,640
She may trick Jenny, but not me
I know everything about cosmetics

326
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,850
Someone's the main vocalist,
the lead dancer...

327
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,250
I'm the pretty face

328
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,550
Why can't the pretty face
be the main?

329
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,460
We have to shoot tomorrow
Go to bed

330
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,890
I'm the main now...Look at my eyes

331
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,930
Eun-ju?

332
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,240
Yes, it's me

333
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,040
Eun-ju...

334
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:01,350
Don't tell the boss that I posted
the photos

335
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,040
She would've made me the
main vocalist anyway

336
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,640
You can't be the main

337
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,350
It's my song

338
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:10,950
What?

339
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,860
Do you want to be the main?

340
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,950
You're nothing but a back dancer

341
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,060
Cut! Okay!

342
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,560
Prepare the camera for the
main vocalist

343
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,670
You can be the main next time

344
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,780
I refuse to sing if I'm not the main

345
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,180
Then what do you plan to do?

346
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,080
Home shopping? A fashion model?

347
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,180
We're going after "Pure". We can't
have their old servant as the main

348
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,390
You're the sponsor's servant,
aren't you?

349
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,690
- Watch it!
- Boss

350
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,200
We're shooting in 5 minutes

351
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,890
- Shin-ji!
- Leave her

352
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,200
Idols can't walk off the stage

353
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,400
Balance your hips and legs
Then spin around

354
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,710
Do the motion in the hook intro

355
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,810
Your expressions are important
so keep your face in the frame

356
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,510
Okay?

357
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,810
Geez I've got a bad feeling
about this

358
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,410
A-rang, are you okay?
Want to postpone it?

359
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,930
No, we should do it
while we're on a roll

360
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,620
But Eun-ju...

361
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,440
It's hot in here, don't you think?

362
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,030
Okay, we're ready

363
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,440
A-rang,
please stand in the middle

364
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,750
Get into it more

365
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,250
Be lovely

366
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,260
Be sweet

367
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,450
Smile

368
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,560
Smile

369
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,960
Okay, that's good Keep going

370
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,470
Yes, you're doing well

371
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,510
She's just really exhausted

372
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,520
The negative reaction to cosmetic surgery
has resulted in auto nervous system shock

373
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,520
When can she get back on the stage?

374
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,110
She can't perform in her state

375
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,330
Now it's just the two of us

376
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,550
Shin-ji, you're really getting there

377
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,850
Anyone
who can roll their neck better?

378
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,360
Eun-ju...

379
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,730
Horrible video of A-rang

380
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,250
Hot, hot, hot...

381
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,350
Hot, hot, hot...

382
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:00,660
Hot, hot, hot...

383
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,760
Hot, hot, hot...

384
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,180
It's so hot

385
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,780
I wrote down the lyrics from
the 2 videos

386
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,390
It's just a coincidence

387
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,790
It's so hot This studio...

388
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,490
There was a fire here, right?
People must've died too

389
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,300
I have to go

390
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:40,700
Look into it for me then

391
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:42,000
I'll call you

392
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,910
Don't you even know
how to say hello?

393
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,110
Do you practice all night too?

394
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:02,220
I bet
nobody knows that idols do that

395
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,830
Don't you agree?

396
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,020
Singing is a job too

397
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,540
I thought I just had to practice
I was so stupid

398
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:16,840
They formed "Pure" from a bunch of
girls who had just entered the agency

399
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:22,140
I wasted 8 years of my life

400
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:26,750
I'm sorry,

401
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,250
I'm going to be the main

402
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,450
Shin-ji, wait...

403
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,750
I have a bad feeling about this song

404
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,760
Let's postpone being the main

405
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,970
Why? Do you want to be the main?

406
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,470
I can't give it up
Especially for a back dancer like you

407
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,780
Stop it

408
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,590
Or your neck could dislocate

409
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,010
I'm going to be the main

410
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,160
Entertainment agency
10 deaths in fire

411
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,660
It was 15 years ago

412
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,360
A lot of people died

413
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,970
The owner, their sponsor...
That girl too

414
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,970
Is that her?

415
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,980
Name Jang Ye-bin,
18 years old at the time

416
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:17,080
She was the most promising talent
at the agency

417
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:20,280
They decided to make her the
main vocalist in "White"

418
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,980
She was really competitive
She had a reputation for being tough

419
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,990
Someone committed suicide
before this incident

420
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,490
Everyone blamed Jang Ye-bin

421
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,990
Someone died before the fire?

422
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,290
A trainee who used to be
a back dancer

423
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,990
One trainee, prior to the fire...
It was suicide

424
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:41,700
That means it was really competitive

425
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,010
Anyway, the main vocalist of "White"
who died because it was too hot...

426
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,310
Could only be one person,
Jang Ye-bin

427
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,010
Anything else?

428
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,020
The sponsor played around
with the kids

429
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,310
It's the same then and now

430
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,220
Jang Ye-bin became the main after
meeting up with her sponsor

431
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:07,030
Her first shoot after
becoming the main was cancelled

432
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,120
Cancelled?

433
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,230
There was an NG on the first day

434
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,740
They postponed the shoot The fire
occurred on the day of the re-shoot

435
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,040
How bad was the NG for the shoot
to be postponed?

436
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,440
She became the main but her
first shoot was cancelled

437
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,450
Then she died in a fire

438
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,050
And her voice is in the song
There must be an explanation

439
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,750
Jang Ye-bin didn't die in an accident
Someone did it

440
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,350
Do you think so?

441
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,370
This song entails some kind
of curse

442
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,660
No way...

443
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,470
Who's the main after A-rang?
Shin-ji?

444
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,580
Find the exit and escape from
the building

445
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,090
Find the exit and escape from
the building

446
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,090
When the sensor sounds, men will
chase you. Run away from them, okay?

447
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,800
Okay, stand on the start line
Hurry up

448
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,490
Ready? Go!

449
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,100
She's running
Shin-ji is running away

450
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,300
A self-destructive variety show
'Survival Challenge'

451
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,210
Today is a Shin-ji special

452
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,210
Her mission is to escape from
the agency building

453
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,210
Trainees often want to run

454
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,720
Yes, being a star isn't always
glamorous

455
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,810
Sometimes you want to run away

456
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:02,750
Go and get her She's running

457
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,850
The door is locked!

458
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,710
Shin-ji is running away

459
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,610
Now she's outside of the building

460
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,520
The goal is within reach

461
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,320
Will she complete her mission?

462
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,730
An unexpected obstacle! Fans!

463
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,100
It's okay, she's just a little hurt

464
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,310
We're making sure it's kept quiet

465
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,610
The head choreographer
wants his pay...

466
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,710
Be quiet! Hello? Hello!?

467
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:02,830
What happened?

468
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,730
A spinal fracture
She's luckyto be alive

469
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,330
Are you all right?

470
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,630
We have to find out
what happened 15 years ago

471
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,330
Otherwise...

472
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,340
Next it could be me

473
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:21,840
Tell me what you're looking for

474
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,540
There's an NG somewhere on
this tape

475
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,140
What kind of NG?

476
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,740
Jang Ye-bin died the day that
the shoot was postponed

477
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,350
It must be related to the NG

478
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,450
Put in the moving pictures and
match the lyrics

479
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:34,750
What are you on about?

480
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:38,860
1 minute 14 seconds, 10 frames...

481
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,970
1 minute 57 seconds, 15 frames...

482
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,070
2 minutes 34 seconds, 10 frames

483
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,770
It's so hot in here

484
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,970
Okay, after this part....
What words comes next when joined?

485
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,380
What comes after these lyrics?

486
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,580
Geez

487
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,080
That doesn't make any sense

488
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,090
Can we start from the end?

489
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,400
There's no face

490
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,410
This is kind of scary

491
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:27,700
Wait

492
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,110
We looked at the
tape in reverse, right?

493
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,710
Yes

494
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,910
Can we flip it around?

495
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,130
I don't hear anything

496
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,030
Of course you don't

497
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,740
There must be a clue somewhere...

498
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,140
The chorus

499
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,040
How about the chorus?

500
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,740
What? The chorus?

501
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:03,750
It's the most important part of
the song

502
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,650
- Try it
- I don't believe this

503
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,450
Come on

504
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,250
Fine, I'll crank up the middle tone

505
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,550
Until it sounds like a human voice

506
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:40,470
There's no face...
That's the NG take

507
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:44,090
She wanted to cover up her
damaged face and shoot,

508
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,880
but it was impossible

509
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,890
That's why there were so many NGs

510
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,990
Why her face?

511
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,190
She's the main vocalist

512
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,700
Maybe someone poisoned her
make-up

513
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,200
Who would do something like that?

514
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:05,310
There must have been a lot of girls
who wanted to be the main

515
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,810
They would do anything to
become the main

516
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,120
Okay

517
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:21,920
So here's howthe story goes

518
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,720
Jang Ye-bin became the
main of "White"

519
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,830
The others terrorized her face
and the 1st shoot was called NG

520
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,130
But she wanted to continue
shooting

521
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,540
So the others set fire and burned
her to death

522
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:36,540
Is that right?

523
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:39,640
No, that's strange

524
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:41,640
Why?

525
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:45,150
They ruined her face already
Why set a fire?

526
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,050
She would've already lost the
main spot

527
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,140
To make sure, I guess

528
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:49,950
No

529
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:57,150
To undo the curse, I have to
find out who killed Jang Ye-bin

530
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,550
Everything is being repeated

531
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:04,370
If I keep going, l'll find the answer

532
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,060
What?

533
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,570
I'm in Jang Ye-bin's situation

534
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,170
The main spot will come to me

535
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,570
I will feel threatened

536
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,870
Then you should ask for help
Ask the boss...

537
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:20,880
If not her, then the sponsor

538
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,900
Why did you change your mind?

539
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,610
I guess...

540
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,910
I want to be the main vocalist too

541
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,410
I've come this far already
I should take it to the end

542
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:56,820
It's just the way it is

543
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,620
It was like that in mytime

544
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,820
It will continue in future too

545
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,840
"Pink Dolls"?
will they split up?

546
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:39,760
Did you think
I'd be old and ugly?

547
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,160
Life's really unfair, isn't it?

548
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,760
Please help me

549
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,860
Yes, I will

550
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,080
There's something I need to know
Please help me

551
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,480
Please

552
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,080
Our studio...

553
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,380
Did it belong to your father?

554
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,480
Yes

555
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:10,490
Relax a little

556
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,790
Do you want to know
how he died?

557
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:17,790
No

558
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:23,700
I want to hear about the trainee
that he fooled around with

559
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,500
You're really cute

560
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,300
She had white hair

561
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,710
I know We were the same age

562
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:36,910
She was talented

563
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:39,510
She wrote their songs,
choreographed the dances

564
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:43,720
Her name was Jang Ye-bin

565
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,520
I don't know her name

566
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,430
She hurt her face...
She lost the main spot

567
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,440
Then she killed herself

568
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,750
Maybe I shouldn't have said that

569
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,460
What else?

570
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,860
Come on

571
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:24,360
Hurry up

572
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:36,170
Jang Ye-bin wasn't murdered
She committed suicide

573
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:05,400
She must've really wanted to be the main
That's why she came to see my father

574
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,810
Just like you

575
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,050
The lights went out
I thought it was a crazy fan

576
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:39,760
I came and found her passed out

577
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,270
What's that?

578
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:47,970
It's probably a suicide note

579
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,970
How do you know that?

580
01:05:56,650 --> 01:06:00,280
Jang Ye-bin
started the fire herself

581
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:03,380
Jang Ye... Who? Fire?

582
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:06,980
There was a fire here
15 years ago

583
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,390
A lot of people died

584
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,290
Eun-ju!

585
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,290
Sun-ye!

586
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:20,500
Sun-ye...

587
01:06:20,570 --> 01:06:21,400
You're okay now

588
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,430
Deceased, Jang Ye-bin

589
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,350
Please forgive them

590
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:15,750
Rest in peace

591
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:44,580
My dance and song were taken

592
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,280
My face was damaged

593
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,790
I decided on suicide as
my last resort

594
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:48,880
It's so hot...

595
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:54,700
The moment she died...
She must've wanted to say that

596
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,490
Everything will work out now

597
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:00,200
I have a good feeling about it

598
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,300
Yes, boss

599
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,710
Yes, we're on our way

600
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:14,620
Mr. Choi transferred the money
just now

601
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,250
Eun-ju of "Pink Dolls" is back with
her hair dyed a shocking white

602
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,350
With her first solo single recording

603
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:58,950
& preparing for her music video shoot
next week, Eun-ju is extremely busy

604
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:02,970
Whether her first solo single can
bring her back to popularity

605
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,970
Whether she can overcome bad luck...
Everyone is curious to find out

606
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,160
"White"
is a huge success in Korea

607
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,370
Eun-ju's old photographs are
a big ssue on the web right now

608
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:17,170
"White" is working up a storm

609
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:20,380
"White" has done it at last

610
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:23,480
Within 2 weeks of the
music video and album release

611
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:25,890
She's caught up to a single album
of "Pure"

612
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,590
She will be battling it out for 1st place in
next week's 200th episode of 'Music Fever'

613
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,390
Everyone is curious to see whether
her solo debut will be

614
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,190
affected by the recent unfortunate
events of "Pink Dolls"

615
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,790
The patients have woken up

616
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:39,700
Yes, all 3 of them

617
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,020
Come on, let's go

618
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:57,320
Leave it, I can do that

619
01:09:57,890 --> 01:10:00,020
I'm almost done
Give me 5 more minutes

620
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:01,520
Okay, hurry up then

621
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,550
I love you!

622
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,560
Wait a minute

623
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:48,760
Everyone, gather around

624
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,970
That's good,
but we need more energy in part A

625
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,480
I'm sure
you're all going to debut too

626
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:02,380
What do you think about when
you dance?

627
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:07,280
I think that I'm going to die dancing
in front of the crowd

628
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,690
Dancers, please do your best

629
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,590
Let's move, everyone

630
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:14,290
Let's wrap up

631
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:14,990
Eun-ju!

632
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:22,900
You dyed your hair

633
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:23,910
Does it look strange?

634
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,000
No, it's pretty

635
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:27,310
But it's really hot in here

636
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:28,400
Is it?

637
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,310
I'm cold.
The air-conditioner, fans...

638
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,320
"White"!
Can I do a short interview?

639
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:38,910
Yes...

640
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:40,320
Sorry, I'll be back

641
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:45,320
You seem close

642
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,130
She's an acquaintance..

643
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,930
Okay, why don't we begin?

644
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,940
How do you feel about your
solo debut?

645
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,340
It hasn't been easy for me

646
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:59,340
But I'm happy to finally make
my debut

647
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:02,440
I composed and choreographed
the song myself

648
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:07,140
I worked on developing a sexy,
provocative new side to "White"

649
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,750
I composed and choreographed
the song

650
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:20,760
The song has a complex story
I hope it will be loved

651
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:26,470
That's not true
I was never a back dancer

652
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,470
I debuted late, so I think people
made up stories about that

653
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,670
No-one hides that kind of stuff
these days

654
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:55,600
That was a hot performance
What's next?

655
01:12:55,670 --> 01:13:01,100
A song of tears over an unforgotten love
Bang Seung-bae will sing it for us

656
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,100
'Sorrow'

657
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:04,400
That's it for the rehearsal

658
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,600
Stand-by
and we'll start in 30 minutes

659
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,110
Hurry up, please

660
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,110
"White"... Jang Ye-bin...

661
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,610
You expect us to believe that?

662
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:21,420
You all experienced it

663
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:23,520
I still can't believe it

664
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:27,130
There's no other explanation for it

665
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,930
Why not?
Maybe you poisoned us

666
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,730
A-rang, watch your mouth

667
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,040
Don't give me that
Do you think it makes sense?

668
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,130
Why would a trainee who's going
to debut meet a sponsor?

669
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:44,440
Don't pick a fight. It's all over
The police confirmed it too

670
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,450
Because they don't know this field

671
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,440
There are only 2 types of girls
that go to meet sponsors

672
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,850
A rookie back dancer
who wants to be a star

673
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,960
Or a cheap has-been whose
expiry date is approaching

674
01:13:58,530 --> 01:13:59,460
Just like you

675
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,160
Call me if you run out of gigs

676
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,960
I'll see if I can find you
a spot as my back dancer

677
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,670
See you then

678
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:17,080
Maybe we won't see you again

679
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,480
What did I do wrong?

680
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,290
They're in shock
after everything that happened

681
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:41,190
This all began because they fought
each other to be the main vocalist

682
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:44,500
- Is that my fault too?
- That's enough. Stop it

683
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,300
You know it too

684
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,810
They never treated me with
any respect

685
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,010
To tell the truth...

686
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,310
I think
they deserve to be punished

687
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,320
Eun-ju...

688
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:57,110
We're here

689
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,310
You asked me
to drop you off here

690
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:16,840
Anyway, make sure you come first

691
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,050
"White" MR

692
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,250
"White" original song

693
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,550
"White" music video

694
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,060
Empty trash

695
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,560
Delete files?

696
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,270
"White" original song

697
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,990
Are you in the recording studio?
Did you delete it all?

698
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,590
Don't delete it! Stay right there!

699
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:23,400
Eun-ju,
should we do your make-up?

700
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:34,610
It's me

701
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,310
Haven't you had enough?

702
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:39,320
I'm starting to get scared too
Restore files

703
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,620
I need to check something

704
01:16:41,690 --> 01:16:42,620
"White" original video

705
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,330
Look at that

706
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,230
Notice anything strange?

707
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:53,930
I don't know

708
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:56,640
Stop there

709
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,430
Play it in slow motion

710
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,650
The lips and song don't match

711
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,750
Especially there. You can't open
your mouth that wide at that pitch

712
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:14,650
Listen carefully

713
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:23,660
It's doubling

714
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,870
3 minutes left, 3 minutes
This way

715
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,980
Get ready. 3 minutes to go

716
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:45,080
Old pop show, songs of memories
Should we get the show started?

717
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:59,500
The other parts
are all doubling too

718
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,100
This song...

719
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:03,710
It's not Jang Ye-bin's voice

720
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,300
What if "White" wasn't Jang Ye-bin?

721
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:10,710
NG!

722
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,210
Let's look through the NG again
Rewind

723
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,920
I thought there was a suicide note

724
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:18,720
There was no name on it
That part was burnt

725
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:22,010
Why's it so hot in here again?

726
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,520
This is the studio. The hosts here...

727
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,530
Are you the CEO of their agency?

728
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:30,430
No, what's wrong?

729
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,830
I can't reach their boss

730
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:36,430
A-rang and Jenny have passed out
I think they're dead

731
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:37,530
What? Dead?

732
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:40,040
They drank poison to commit suicide
During the show...This is horrible

733
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:42,740
Dead? It's a live show!

734
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:47,240
Hey! Stop Shin-ji! Stop her!

735
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,100
You look so stunning

736
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,800
It's an important day today

737
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,400
Sun-ye

738
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,210
Excuse me

739
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,110
Eun-ju

740
01:19:55,890 --> 01:19:58,620
I'm sorry about earlier

741
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:00,820
Where are you now?

742
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,920
I'm on my way

743
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:05,830
Listen to me, stop the car
You can't go and sing on stage

744
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:06,830
What?

745
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,820
You can't sing "White"
The curse isn't over

746
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:13,630
Stop talking about it
It's all over now

747
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:14,330
Eun-ju!

748
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,240
The song wasn't sung by her
"White" could be someone else

749
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:24,150
Don't do this to me
I'm the main now, got it?

750
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:25,550
I'm "White"!

751
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,640
Hello? Eun-ju!

752
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,450
What about the NG?

753
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,550
It's not moving according to
the subject

754
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,450
These grains are printed on the
film during emulsion

755
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:36,950
Speak so I can understand!

756
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:40,360
The film itself is damaged
Jang Ye-bin's face is fine

757
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,860
Then the NG wasn't
Jang Ye-bin's face

758
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,560
Now go to Eun-ju's video clip

759
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,470
I already am

760
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:54,470
If it's not over There should be
something in her clip

761
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:57,380
3 minutes 15 seconds,
10 frames Here it is

762
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:04,890
This is 'Music Fever'
Are you on your way?

763
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,480
Yes, we'll be there soon

764
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,290
We played
the MR in episode 199

765
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,290
We turned off the microphone
by accident

766
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,700
What? I heard all the vocals

767
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,890
It was nothing major

768
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:20,600
Can you check to see if the AR
and MR CDs were switched?

769
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:23,400
No way, I check it all the time

770
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,510
It's so hot in here, inside my heart

771
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,310
What's it saying?

772
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,010
Are you sure you found the right spot?
- It's right

773
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,020
Are you sure you didn't get confused?
- It's right!

774
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,620
If "White" wasn't Jang Ye-bin,
then who?

775
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,020
Whose voice is that?

776
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:46,020
What we know...They said it's hot

777
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,020
Did another trainee die in the fire?

778
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,630
The list of names!

779
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,640
Search this for me

780
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,240
What is this?

781
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:02,540
A trainee who poisoned themselves
prior to Jang Ye-bin?

782
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:03,940
Don't worry about that

783
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:05,950
A back dancer committed suicide
before the fire happened

784
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,250
"White" says it's hot.

785
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,150
The fire...

786
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,350
It's someone who died in the fire

787
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,260
Hello? Is that the studio?

788
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,660
We all heard it

789
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:30,070
Do you think a ghost sang it?

790
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:31,570
This is so strange

791
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:34,470
Hello? Hello? Hey!

792
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,580
Damn it

793
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:47,080
What did the girls drink?

794
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,090
Chemicals.
They poisoned themselves!

795
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:52,290
I know that! What did they drink?

796
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:55,200
Bleach...
The stuff you use to clean floors

797
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:56,790
Wait...

798
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,300
If you drink that, is it hot?

799
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:00,100
What?

800
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:02,500
Do you get hot if you consume
bleach!?

801
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:04,100
Of course it's hot!

802
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:07,510
It's 100% pure. It burns everything
from your throat to your stomach!

803
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:24,220
A back dancer poisoned herself

804
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:29,430
It's so hot in here, inside my heart

805
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,230
Stop looking

806
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,140
Hang on. Eun-ju's clip

807
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:38,230
It joins with the chorus of part B

808
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,140
Stop it

809
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:41,040
It's useless

810
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:43,240
It's a perfect match.
Let's join them

811
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:46,850
"White" was a back dancer who
drank poison to kill herself

812
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:50,350
She's not in the music video or
in the list of deceased persons

813
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:54,450
Stop it! We don't know her!

814
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,350
Wait

815
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:57,860
- Wait
- Stop!

816
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:00,660
Wait. I'm almost done l said stop!

817
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:01,560
I've got it

818
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:38,430
Here, behind you...

819
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:40,300
There, the "White" hair...

820
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:41,800
There's a ghost

821
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:44,400
A back dancer ghost

822
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,310
NG

823
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:05,220
Hello? Yes, Mr. Choi

824
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,720
It's Mr. Choi

825
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:12,930
Did you arrive? 1st place?

826
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,530
Why are you sweating so much?

827
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:20,140
It's a little hot in here,
don't you think?

828
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:23,140
It's a little hot in here

829
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:31,550
"White", 8 back dancers,
get ready

830
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:33,250
They're 8 in total, right?

831
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:37,750
Don't we have 9 dancers?

832
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:40,750
No, we have 8. Let's go

833
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:46,170
Do I have some time left?

834
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,570
3 or 4 minutes Make it quick

835
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:02,380
Do a good job. I trust you

836
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,590
Just think of it as your
last performance

837
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,190
You don't regret it, right?

838
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:13,690
It's not like I had any other choice

839
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:18,890
Besides...

840
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:22,300
I've come too far now

841
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,510
Give me a minute, please
I'll be out soon

842
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,630
We're totally stuck
We won't make it on time

843
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,630
We can't be late
Open the boot for me

844
01:26:58,710 --> 01:26:59,940
Geez

845
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:16,750
Delete?

846
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:27,760
Delete request
unable to be completed

847
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:30,070
Update requests

848
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:46,880
The 200th episode of 'Music Fever'

849
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:51,090
Who will be 1st place on our 200th
anniversary? Nominees, come out!

850
01:28:03,970 --> 01:28:09,500
"White", we're awaiting the
announcement How do you feel right now?

851
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,910
You must be
overwhelmed with emotion

852
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:20,620
Eun-ju?

853
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:27,630
Thank you for your support
I will continue to do my best

854
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,630
It's her first time being nominated

855
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:36,330
She's so nervous that I feel nervous
just standing next to her

856
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,930
Enough of the small talk
Let's see the results

857
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:40,340
Please show us
the graph for 1st place!

858
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,850
The votes have been all cast

859
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:57,760
Who will be awarded 1st place?

860
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:02,160
1st place...

861
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,470
Goes to "White"!

862
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:15,170
The queen of the 200th show!
Congratulations!

863
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:34,890
You must be so happy

864
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,400
Please tell us
how you feel right now

865
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:50,510
It's so hot in here right now
I can feel the temperature rising

866
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:54,410
Let's hear the 200th music queen,
"White" song and return

867
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,820
Give us the song!

868
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:00,420
I knew you'd come 1st
I'll call you

869
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:10,750
What was that?

870
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:12,150
What's happening?

871
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,350
Please stay calm

872
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:16,360
What was that?

873
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:17,760
Please turn on

874
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,580
Please stay calm

875
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:40,780

Calm down everyone
Please stay calm

877
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:01,690
Can you go and save Eun-ju?

878
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:04,710
Help her, Mr. Choi!

879
01:33:04,770 --> 01:33:06,610
Move!

880
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,410
Open the door!

881
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:19,120
Open up!

882
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:39,840
Eun-ju

883
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:41,140
Boss!

884
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:06,120
Eun-ju... sorry

885
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,260
Eun-ju!

886
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:40,460
Eun-ju!

887
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:46,570
Over here!

888
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:53,070
I'm here!

889
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:02,780
Eun-ju! No!

890
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,190
Eun-ju!

891
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:59,190
Around 4 p.m. this afternoon,

892
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:03,400
there was a fire
at 'Music Fever' studio

893
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:06,410
At the site,
popular singer, "White"

894
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:10,000
Choi Eun-ju is believed
to be still inside the studio

895
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,710
We will advise you once we have
more information

896
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:16,510
We have a report..

897
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:34,730
You're nothing but a back dancer
I told you not to stand out

898
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:38,640
How does it feel to be main vocal?

899
01:38:40,610 --> 01:38:42,740
Let's see how far you can go with
that ugly face

900
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,640
Do not stand out

901
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:18,100
To: LaLa sisters Thanks... And sorry

902
01:41:59,310 --> 01:42:01,140
Song chosen, "White"

903
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:07,980
