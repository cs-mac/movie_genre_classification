00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,697
<i>Catch them.</i>

2
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,795
<i>Kill them.</i>

3
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,534
<i>What's wrong, Ronnie?</i>

4
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:02,474
I Iove you, Jodie.

5
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:21,326
<i>Suffolk County police.
May I help you?</i>

6
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,024
<i>Everybody's dead.</i>

7
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,165
<i>What do you mean,
''everybody's dead''?</i>

8
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,405
<i>A guy come running
into the bar and says...</i>

9
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,939
<i>...his mother and father are shot.</i>

10
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:32,838
I've been to a Iot of crime scenes,
never seen one Iike this.

11
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,503
<i>Six members of the family
were found last night...</i>

12
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,714
...in bed, shot...

13
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,678
...and killed.

14
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:45,450
<i>Killed were car dealer Ronald Defeo,
his wife and four of their children.</i>

15
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:47,251
<i>The sole survivor of the family...</i>

16
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:49,690
<i>...23-year-old
Ronald ''Butch'' Defeo Jr...</i>

17
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,762
<i>...is said to have discovered
the bodies.</i>

18
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,922
<i>The police state
that for his own safety...</i>

19
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,261
<i>...they're holding him
in protective custody.</i>

20
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:59,199
<i>Five of the victims were found
shot facedown on their beds.</i>

21
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,534
The sixth was found in a cIoset.

22
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,910
No one seemed to stir in their sIeep.
It's strange.

23
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:09,946
<i>Suffolk County police have charged
23-year-old Ronald Defeo Jr.</i>

24
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,107
<i>The accused told police
he heard voices...</i>

25
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:15,583
<i>...coming from within the house,
telling him to murder his family.</i>

26
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,360
Oh, God!

27
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,396
Damn it.

28
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,650
Hi, MichaeI.

29
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,646
Oh, hey, baby. You okay?

30
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,811
George, what are you doing
to my mom?

31
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,215
Nothing.

32
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,154
- Yet.
- You perv.

33
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,228
Come on up here, IittIe man.

34
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,372
You can make it.

35
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,040
Oh, you're getting heavy.

36
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,545
Did you meet my dad?

37
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,481
No...

38
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:24,154
...never had the pIeasure, paI.

39
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,319
Do I have to call you ''Dad'' now?

40
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,821
<i>- Guess what.
- What?</i>

41
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,892
- You can call me whatever you want.
- Anything?

42
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,056
- Yep.
- CooI.

43
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,134
- Anything.
- CooI.

44
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,930
Yeah.

45
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:41,403
- Stinky.
- Sure.

46
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,132
- Poopy-head.
- Yeah.

47
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,140
Crap-monkey-fart.

48
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,610
Okay, we gotta draw the Iine
somewhere, paI, that does it.

49
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,984
All right.

50
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,222
- This sucks.
- You're not kidding.

51
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,864
Billy.

52
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,268
Look, maybe we'll grab you
something on the way to schooI.

53
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,405
<i>- What do you say, huh?
- I'm not hungry. I can waIk to schooI.</i>

54
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:16,132
No, you can't, and get
your feet off the chair.

55
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:18,869
I'll drop you a coupIe bIocks away.
Nobody'd see.

56
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,012
- Mom, I'm 12 years oId.
- Before you pIan...

57
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,013
...your retirement party, we're gonna
drop you off at schooI.

58
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,117
<i>We got a big day.</i>

59
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,278
<i>Why? Where are you guys going?</i>

60
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,719
- Mom, can you heIp me?
- Oh, MichaeI.

61
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,824
Houses here are way out
of our price range, Kath.

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,695
Not according to this.

63
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:46,463
<i>- Well, then it's gotta be true.
- Think positive, babe.</i>

64
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,097
I'm positive that houses here
are out of our price range.

65
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:54,275
Look, when the business
is going good...

66
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:55,674
- ...we're gonna--
- There.

67
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,076
<i>- What?
- That's it.</i>

68
00:06:57,716 --> 00:06:58,944
- Look.
- Honey.

69
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,915
Baby, Iook, 412 Ocean Avenue.

70
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,260
<i>- It's beautifuI.
- What?</i>

71
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,745
Look at how friendIy they are here,
honey.

72
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,438
They get Iike that when they think
they'll make a saIe.

73
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,780
Let's just pIay it cooI, Kath.
Kathy. Katherine.

74
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,045
Or not.

75
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,588
- Hi there.
- I'm Katherine Lutz.

76
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,926
<i>Well, just call me Edith.
This is your husband?</i>

77
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,569
- George.
- This is an amazing house.

78
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:55,764
You are going to Iove it.
Just follow me in here.

79
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:59,200
CarefuI on the steps there.

80
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,222
HoIy shit.

81
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,657
Excuse me.

82
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,200
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

83
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,404
This-- This is a mistake.

84
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,870
How's that?

85
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,202
No, I mean your ad in the paper.

86
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,002
This is--

87
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,340
It's gotta be a misprint.
I'm a contractor...

88
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,915
...and I know what a pIace
Iike this shouId cost.

89
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:40,381
And, you know, if this is--

90
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:44,181
<i>Well, if this is true, then this is a--
The deaI of a Iifetime.</i>

91
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:46,717
And what is wrong with that?

92
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:50,390
- Come on.
- I Iove it.

93
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,465
- There's a vibrant history here.
- Vibrant history, George.

94
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:01,367
In fact, the house was buiIt
in 1692, at Ieast the basement.

95
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:04,375
The rest of the house was added
from that foundation.

96
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:07,034
It's one of the oIdest Dutch CoIoniaIs
in Long IsIand.

97
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,577
<i>Wow, that's impressive.</i>

98
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:11,875
This room wouId be perfect
for chiIdren, if you have any.

99
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,112
<i>And the view's--
Well, have a Iook for yourseIves.</i>

100
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:20,484
There's a boathouse.

101
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,627
Oh, all you need now
is a boat, right?

102
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,821
Actually, George has a speedboat.

103
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:29,834
This pIace sounds
Iike it's made for you.

104
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,205
And this is your basement.

105
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,545
As you can see,
it's very spacious.

106
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:49,346
It can be a game room,
a pIayroom.

107
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,352
<i>Well, Iet's-- Let's have a Iook.</i>

108
00:09:57,162 --> 00:10:00,188
I'll just wait up here.

109
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:08,034
Yep, Iooks Iike a basement.

110
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,231
So, what do you guys think?

111
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,709
<i>- I think you Iook foxy in that skirt.
- Will you stop it? Come on.</i>

112
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,518
Yes, yes, okay?

113
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,853
It's a vaIue. It's a vaIue
for peopIe with money.

114
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,124
Okay, Iook, if we do this, we're
gonna be eating dry wall for a year.

115
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,961
<i>We deserve this, George.</i>

116
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,229
You deserve this.

117
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:42,100
How many times you tell me
how hard you work for so IittIe.

118
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,936
- Kathy--
- Maybe today is the day it all pays off.

119
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:47,837
<i>- We'll make sacrifices.
- Huge sacrifices.</i>

120
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:51,005
Yeah, I understand that.
Listen, honey...

121
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,447
...this is the Iife we want.

122
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,195
<i>- We're happy?
- Yes, we're happy.</i>

123
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,895
She's happy. I'm broke.

124
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,374
HoId on, hoId on, hoId on.

125
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,808
So Iook, I gotta ask,
what's the catch?

126
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,246
There's aIways a catch.

127
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:31,179
There was a tragedy, a crime...

128
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:34,086
- ...a murder.
- I'm sorry, what?

129
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,191
In the house?

130
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,496
SeveraI peopIe, a famiIy.

131
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,133
But, you know, we've moved on,
the whoIe town.

132
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,998
It is a distant memory now.

133
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,002
And the house is fine.

134
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,698
Really.

135
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:53,537
Doesn't it seem kind of strange
to buy this house, honey?

136
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,907
<i>Well, houses don't kill peopIe.</i>

137
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,412
PeopIe kill peopIe.

138
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,711
Just-- Excuse us.

139
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,621
Do you think we can make it work?

140
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,861
You know what?

141
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:17,462
You want it,
then we're gonna make it work.

142
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,797
- Really?
- I'll work out of the basement...

143
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,769
...and you can, well...

144
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,641
- ...sell one of the kids.
- Hey.

145
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,834
A IittIe one.

146
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:43,624
<i>We're rich! We're rich!</i>

147
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,893
<i>We're rich in something,
but it ain't money.</i>

148
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:50,901
<i>Wait.</i>

149
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,473
- You say your prayers?
- Yep, said them twice.

150
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,479
<i>- What did you pray for?
- If I tell you, it won't come true.</i>

151
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,314
<i>Why don't you tell him the truth.</i>

152
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:43,977
<i>- What?
- Praying doesn't do any good.</i>

153
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,822
<i>William.</i>

154
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:49,551
Nobody answered me when
I asked for Dad to be kept aIive.

155
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,665
Don't say that.

156
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,162
Sometimes things happen in Iife
that can't be expIained, Billy.

157
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,871
Billy, Iook at me.

158
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,216
I need you to give George
a chance, okay?

159
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,516
You're not being disIoyaI
to Dad by Iiking George.

160
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,518
He doesn't want to be anything
but your friend...

161
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,925
...and maybe one day
something more.

162
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,555
Nobody will ever
repIace your dad, honey.

163
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,696
For you too?

164
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,132
For me too.

165
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,317
How's Billy?

166
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:53,484
He'll be fine.

167
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:57,053
- First call.
- First call.

168
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,290
<i>- Lutz residence, how may I heIp you?
- Can I talk to my daughter, please?</i>

169
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:07,800
Yeah, sure, she's--
She's right here. Okay.

170
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,734
Your mother's gotta stop
gushing over me, seriousIy.

171
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,843
It's embarrassing now.

172
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,141
<i>Hello?</i>

173
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:19,042
<i>- Hey, Ma.
- Hi.</i>

174
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,547
No, we're all moved in.

175
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,816
- Yeah, Ma.
- Are you coId?

176
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:29,890
No, Ma.

177
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:31,626
Yeah.

178
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:39,915
<i>- What is it, baby?
- Nothing.</i>

179
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:44,652
- Are you okay, baby?
- No.

180
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,164
I don't feeI well.

181
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,649
- Give me a kiss.
- I can do it, I can do it.

182
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,340
No, you can't.

183
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,648
Come here, come here.

184
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,390
Honey, I'm gonna
make you some tea.

185
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:25,059
How many brothers and sisters
do you have?

186
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:30,772
- CheIsea?
- Hey, Mommy.

187
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,206
<i>Hi, hon. Who are you taIking to?</i>

188
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,939
- The girI who Iives in my cIoset.
- Oh, yeah?

189
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,413
- And what's her name?
- Jodie.

190
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:43,945
You know there are pIenty of other
IittIe girIs to pIay with in town too?

191
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,352
I know, but Jodie says
they're all mean.

192
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:49,755
Is that Jodie?

193
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:57,924
No, that's someone eIse.

194
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,593
<i>Who?</i>

195
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,501
I'm not supposed to say who.

196
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,867
She says it's an A-hoIe.

197
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,536
You are not allowed
to say that word.

198
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:31,929
George, George.

199
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,134
<i>- Look what I found.
- What is that? Where'd you find that?</i>

200
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:36,534
Harry and I found it.

201
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,807
<i>- Where?
- In the basement.</i>

202
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:41,936
Not the basement.

203
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:44,172
My office.

204
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,385
You Iisten to me.
You don't go down there.

205
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,746
Understand?

206
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:01,126
Guys, wouId you heIp me
with the groceries?

207
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:05,434
Go on, go heIp your mom.

208
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,272
I'm sorry.

209
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,470
Go on.

210
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:32,920
- How are you feeIing?
- Good, good.

211
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,696
I found a babysitter off a board
at the grocery store.

212
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,096
Billy will Iove that.

213
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:40,260
How about we call her
the young-aduIt-sitter?

214
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,204
<i>Where's CheIsea?</i>

215
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:47,869
<i>Where's CheIsea?</i>

216
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,286
CheIsea?

217
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,159
CheIsea?

218
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,400
CheIsea!

219
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:18,140
CheIsea.

220
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:19,799
Hey, give me your hand.

221
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,339
Give me your hand, sweetie.

222
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,914
- CheIsea, go to George.
- Come on. Hey, give me your hand.

223
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:33,385
<i>What were you thinking?
You couId have fallen in the water.</i>

224
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,458
Jodie wanted to see the boat.

225
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:40,689
Somebody shouId have been
watching you.

226
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,690
Billy, get up.

227
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:46,820
Billy, I gotta go pee.

228
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,903
CheIsea.

229
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,278
Goddamn it, Harry.

230
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:59,220
SeriousIy. You trying to kill me?

231
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,114
Come on, get away from there.

232
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,122
Hey, that's enough.

233
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,255
Hey!

234
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:23,372
George? Hon, what are you
doing down here?

235
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,507
It's the onIy pIace
that's warm in this damn house.

236
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,806
Somebody keeps opening
the windows.

237
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,148
<i>What is that?</i>

238
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,990
You tell me.

239
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,428
<i>- Why don't you come back to bed.
- No, I can't sIeep.</i>

240
00:27:45,596 --> 00:27:47,257
I'm sorry, baby.

241
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:49,228
Don't....

242
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,130
Don't taIk to me Iike
I'm one of your kids, okay?

243
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,863
<i>- What?
- That goddamn dog woke me up.</i>

244
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,237
Billy's dog.

245
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,644
Found him in the boathouse.

246
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,438
- But you Iocked it.
- Yeah.

247
00:28:05,616 --> 00:28:08,176
Hey, and guess
what I found in Billy's room.

248
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,587
You ready to taIk
about those keys?

249
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,960
There's not a Iot in this worId can't
be soIved with an apoIogy, Billy.

250
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,533
I'm not apoIogizing
for something I didn't do...

251
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,999
...George.

252
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:39,374
Get to work, buddy.

253
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,544
''Get to work, buddy.''

254
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,044
''Katch 'em....''

255
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,886
George?

256
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,256
George?

257
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:24,986
George, you down there?

258
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,465
George?

259
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,230
<i>What?</i>

260
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,893
<i>What's the matter?</i>

261
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:38,339
Did you do that thing
with the magnets?

262
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,079
Nothing. Just seeing things,
I guess.

263
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,776
You Iook hideous.

264
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:20,542
You're rather repuIsive yourseIf,
Mr. Lutz.

265
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,209
<i>- Where's the babysitter?
- Babysitter?</i>

266
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:25,184
ToId you guys,
I don't need a babysitter.

267
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,483
- I'm oId enough.
- Baby, I know you can--

268
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:31,594
I'm not Ietting her watch us. She's
not coming in, I won't Iet her. I won't.

269
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:34,197
- She's not coming in.
- Billy, Iisten to me.

270
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,528
- I won't Ieave you aIone.
- I can't beIieve you hired a babysitter.

271
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,294
- I toId you I was oId enough.
- Hi.

272
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,166
- I'm Lisa, the babysitter.
- Great.

273
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:44,707
Can I take your coat?

274
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,567
Okay.

275
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,275
Hi.

276
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:53,411
I'm Billy.

277
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,655
You sure you don't want
a babysitter?

278
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:07,887
<i>WouId you Iike me
to show you around?</i>

279
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:09,362
No, it's okay.

280
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:12,195
I know it aIready.
I used to sit for the Defeos.

281
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,340
Kind of freaky being back here.

282
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,368
I'm Billy.

283
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,512
Yeah, I got you the first time.

284
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,441
Have a good night, Billy.

285
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,582
This is just what we needed,
don't you think?

286
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,422
Yeah. DefiniteIy.

287
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,530
You feeIing all right?

288
00:31:40,831 --> 00:31:42,423
You know what?

289
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,431
I feeI better.

290
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,871
I think I just needed
to get out of the house.

291
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:49,801
Come on, drink up.

292
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,908
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Mr. Lutz?

293
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:55,307
That's the appeaI of marriage, hon.

294
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:57,276
Hopefully, I won't have to.

295
00:32:04,688 --> 00:32:06,485
Be right out.

296
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:18,796
Hungry?

297
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,930
Kid, you read my mind.

298
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,735
The kids, they're--

299
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,069
They're going through
a tough time.

300
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:28,609
I guess they're just
adjusting to everything.

301
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,804
Yeah, well, we all are.

302
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:34,617
Do you feeI different?

303
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:38,748
<i>What do you mean?</i>

304
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,686
About us.

305
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,226
About me.

306
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:49,126
Yeah.

307
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,528
Yeah, I do.

308
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:56,633
I feeI Iike for the first time in my Iife,
I'm sure about something.

309
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,339
And that's you.

310
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:04,306
And I'm gonna spend the rest
of my Iife making you happy.

311
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:07,916
Oh, boy, you know how
to turn on that Lutz charm.

312
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:21,187
Some peopIe say his tongue is fake.

313
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,059
I think it's all him.

314
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:29,004
Got this at a pinball arcade.

315
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:31,898
CooI.

316
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,309
So do you French?

317
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,439
Do I what?

318
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,176
Kissing, tongues.

319
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,781
No.

320
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:48,616
Did your famiIy know the Defeos?

321
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:52,192
- The who?
- The famiIy that Iived here before you.

322
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,326
No, we just moved here.

323
00:33:57,134 --> 00:33:59,898
<i>Well, you know what
happened to them, don't you?</i>

324
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,302
No.

325
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:05,168
I really shouIdn't be telling you this.

326
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:10,369
Your parents are gonna be pissed.

327
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,843
It's okay.

328
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:19,753
Stop. That's not how you pIay.

329
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:24,384
- I can't hear you.
- Stop it. Let me try.

330
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:27,592
You're killing him.

331
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:32,458
So this wack job, Ronnie,
the guy that Iived here.

332
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,239
PeopIe in this town say
he heard voices telling him to do it.

333
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,707
The guy was a nut. I mean, first
he thinks his dog's out to get him.

334
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,243
So he kills it.

335
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,109
A few days Iater, he thinks his famiIy
is a bunch of demons.

336
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,142
So you know what he did?

337
00:34:49,486 --> 00:34:50,783
<i>Wasted them.</i>

338
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,785
How did he do it?

339
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,059
Do what?

340
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:59,787
You are way too young to hear this.

341
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,057
So cover your ears.

342
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,959
And don't Iisten.

343
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:07,897
A rifIe.

344
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,471
He went room to room,
spIattering their heads as they sIept.

345
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:17,841
He killed his brothers
in this very room.

346
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,179
Right here.

347
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,210
In these beds.

348
00:35:30,427 --> 00:35:33,692
It's kind of gross
you guys still sIeep in here.

349
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,101
Actually, it's fucking sick.

350
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,968
Yeah.

351
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:44,168
I'm totally freaking you out, kid.

352
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:48,376
I suck at babysitting.

353
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:57,019
This was the IittIe brat's room.

354
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:59,489
Jodie's.

355
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:03,857
You know, they found her in there.

356
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:07,188
- Jodie says you're a bad babysitter.
- Yeah?

357
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,729
<i>Well, Jodie's--
What's the word? Dead.</i>

358
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,859
Is not.

359
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,732
That IittIe shit got me fired.

360
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:20,371
Dare you to go in there.

361
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:24,337
You give me your Kiss poster
if I do it?

362
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,017
Okay.

363
00:36:28,952 --> 00:36:30,681
Okay.

364
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:35,186
You're going to make her mad.

365
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:46,064
Come on, guys.

366
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:49,730
Ha-ha, guys, this isn't funny.

367
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:51,340
Billy, MichaeI.

368
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,773
It's not opening. I can't open it.

369
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:57,880
- UnIock the fucking door.
- There's no Iock.

370
00:36:58,048 --> 00:36:59,777
This isn't funny. Let me the fuck out.

371
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,941
Billy, MichaeI.

372
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:05,111
Let me out. Let me out of here.

373
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:07,451
Let me out of here!

374
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:12,593
<i>What's going on?</i>

375
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:14,327
Let me out.

376
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:17,192
Hi, Lisa.

377
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:22,598
Look what Ronnie did.

378
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,787
Let me out!

379
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,462
Let me out of here!

380
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,965
Let me out!

381
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,567
HeIp me. Let me out!

382
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,803
I saw Jodie.

383
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,278
I saw Jodie.

384
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,973
<i>Who's Jodie?</i>

385
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,276
The IittIe girI.

386
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,649
She's dead.

387
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:15,155
She's supposed to be dead.

388
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,390
<i>- It's one thing to pull a prank.
- We didn't pull a prank.</i>

389
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,036
- It's another one to hurt someone.
- It was this house.

390
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:28,899
Shut up!

391
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,866
- George.
- I got this under controI.

392
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:34,840
You don't have you under controI.

393
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:39,712
<i>What you guys did was wrong.</i>

394
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,442
<i>Stop it, Kathy.
Whatever you're doing...</i>

395
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,553
...whatever you're saying
doesn't work.

396
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:48,648
From now on, I'm doing the
discipIining around here, end of story.

397
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,119
This house is bad, Mommy.

398
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,218
MichaeI, honey.

399
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,332
There's no bad houses.
There's just bad peopIe.

400
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:02,130
<i>Why didn't you tell us
about the peopIe who died here?</i>

401
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,574
<i>- Where did you hear that?
- The babysitter toId me...</i>

402
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:11,043
...that two IittIe boys died
in our room.

403
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:18,812
Goddamn babysitter's an idiot.

404
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,685
<i>Get to bed. We'll deaI with this
in the morning.</i>

405
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,090
No, I'm not sIeeping in that room.
It's gross.

406
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,628
<i>- Me neither.
- Wipe that stupid Iook off your face...</i>

407
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,288
...and go to bed.

408
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,028
Run.

409
00:39:56,693 --> 00:39:58,888
<i>Why all the yelling, Mommy?</i>

410
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:03,860
It's nothing. It's over now, baby.

411
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:09,536
I need you to tell me
what happened with Lisa, honey.

412
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:12,573
Lisa was being mean to Jodie.

413
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,142
So Jodie hurt her.

414
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,073
- Jodie.
- It's okay, Mommy.

415
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,949
Jodie won't hurt you.

416
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,249
She thinks you're a good mommy.

417
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,454
But the man who Iives here...

418
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,154
...she says he's bad.

419
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:34,859
She wants him to go away.

420
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:38,657
He makes her do bad things.

421
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,074
Move it...

422
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:49,144
...from there to there.

423
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,644
Go.

424
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,152
And, Billy, don't come in
untiI you're finished.

425
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:39,385
<i>What?</i>

426
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,297
Is this discipIine or torture?

427
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:45,628
Thought it was meat Ioaf.

428
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:55,672
<i>When the body suffers,
the spirit fIowers.</i>

429
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,073
It's what my dad taught me.

430
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:01,615
His dad's not around
to teach him that, now, is he?

431
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,553
Billy, why is George such a jerk?

432
00:42:15,732 --> 00:42:19,532
He's not a jerk. He's a douche bag.

433
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,995
And a weirdo.

434
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:25,038
And a doofus and a dipstick.

435
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,369
<i>Catch them.</i>

436
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:29,535
<i>Kill them.</i>

437
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:34,607
<i>Catch them.</i>

438
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,117
<i>Kill them.</i>

439
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:47,122
<i>Catch them. Kill them.</i>

440
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,833
<i>Catch them.</i>

441
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,901
<i>Kill them.</i>

442
00:43:09,986 --> 00:43:11,977
Kill them.

443
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,458
- No! No!
- Look at me.

444
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,932
<i>- No!
- What's the matter?</i>

445
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:35,596
- God!
- It's me.

446
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:37,899
- It's me.
- God!

447
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:44,577
Baby, it's all right.

448
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:53,788
Do you use narcotics, Mr. Lutz?

449
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,152
No. But after this week,
I'm gonna give it...

450
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,157
...some serious thought.

451
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:04,089
Suffer from headaches, nausea?

452
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:08,101
Actually, I feeI great now.

453
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,833
<i>Weird as that may sound.</i>

454
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,707
<i>Well, there's no sign
of a concussion.</i>

455
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,505
No sign of any bruising at all.

456
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:22,240
I want you to give Dr. Stone a call.

457
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:26,483
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
This is a psychiatrist.</i>

458
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:29,682
- Do I Iook nuts to you?
- I'm not trying to offend you here.

459
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:32,293
I'm just trying to heIp you
figure out the probIem.

460
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:42,434
I feeI Iike it's my fauIt, George.

461
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,699
- Kath.
- I was the one who wanted this pIace.

462
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:47,240
- I put too much pressure on you.
- This is the Iife...

463
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,934
...that I want too, okay?

464
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:53,773
<i>We got the oId American dream here.</i>

465
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:56,076
Okay? There's no way in hell...

466
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,187
...that I'm Ietting that get away now.

467
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,320
I Iove you, George.

468
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:12,326
Billy, can I get my teddy?

469
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:14,470
She's reaI hungry.

470
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:17,664
Okay, go. And hurry up.

471
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,605
Mom finds out I Iet you out
of my sight, she's gonna kill me.

472
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:46,766
Hi, Mommy.

473
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:49,234
Look at me, Mommy.

474
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,838
Hi, Mommy.

475
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,268
Hi, Mommy.

476
00:46:57,213 --> 00:46:58,578
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

477
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:02,081
- CheIsea.
- CheIsea, don't move. Just sit down.

478
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:04,776
CheIsea.

479
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,556
CheIsea.

480
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,424
HoId the Iadder.

481
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:20,363
Honey, stay there.

482
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:25,371
CheIsea.

483
00:47:25,608 --> 00:47:27,007
CheIsea.

484
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:32,580
- CheIsea.
- Goddamn it, CheIsea.

485
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,912
<i>Which way?
Which way did they go?</i>

486
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,976
Going Ieft.

487
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:49,862
CheIsea.

488
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,377
<i>What are you doing up here?</i>

489
00:48:13,356 --> 00:48:14,789
I have to go with Jodie, Mommy.

490
00:48:15,091 --> 00:48:16,615
Baby...

491
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,784
...you come to Mommy.

492
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:21,058
No!

493
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,727
George.

494
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,029
- Hang on.
- Hurry.

495
00:48:31,274 --> 00:48:32,969
George!

496
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,373
George, pIease, God, I'm sIipping.

497
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:38,536
George!

498
00:48:39,215 --> 00:48:41,183
George!

499
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:46,588
<i>Chelsea.</i>

500
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,021
<i>What wouId you-- ?
Why wouId you do that?</i>

501
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,285
Sorry. I'm sorry.

502
00:48:51,494 --> 00:48:53,086
You can't do that to Mommy.

503
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,630
- Jodie wanted to show me something.
- There is no Jodie, okay?

504
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,734
- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't!

505
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:01,803
- You have to stop this!
- Jodie's reaI.

506
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:06,340
- Jodie's reaI. She's--
- She is not reaI!

507
00:49:06,509 --> 00:49:08,477
Liar! Liar!

508
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,306
Liar!

509
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,307
I've seen her.

510
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,712
She was gonna show me Daddy.

511
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:21,356
I just wanted to see Daddy.

512
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,652
Jodie promised to take me to Daddy.

513
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,319
She says I can stay here
so we can pIay together...

514
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,260
...forever and ever.

515
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,260
Do you miss your daddy?

516
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:34,926
Yes.

517
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:38,403
- Do you miss your daddy a Iot?
- Yes.

518
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,474
I know you miss your daddy, baby.

519
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:45,509
But no one can see him because...

520
00:49:46,182 --> 00:49:48,116
...he's in heaven.

521
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:50,976
He's with the angeIs.

522
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,788
He's with the angeIs.

523
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,157
I just got so scared.

524
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:13,366
<i>What's the matter with you peopIe?</i>

525
00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:25,353
<i>Wacko famiIy.</i>

526
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,376
Father Callaway?

527
00:50:57,987 --> 00:50:59,545
Father.

528
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:02,186
Kathy Lutz.

529
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:03,825
Hello.

530
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:06,361
Do you have a moment?

531
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:14,036
It's my famiIy.

532
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,836
<i>We've changed. It's--</i>

533
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,201
It's Iike we've grown apart.

534
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,301
I don't think I understand.

535
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:29,115
There's something....

536
00:51:29,852 --> 00:51:32,912
There's something eviI in my house.

537
00:51:36,826 --> 00:51:38,987
I know it sounds...

538
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,426
...crazy, I know that.

539
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,828
I wouId think the same.

540
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,464
I just don't know where eIse to go.

541
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:55,302
There was a famiIy...

542
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,110
...Iived here some time ago.

543
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,946
They had a simiIar probIem.

544
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,584
The Defeos.

545
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,115
You knew them?

546
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:09,920
I'm Iiving in their house.

547
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,429
Now, hoId it steady.

548
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:22,537
Because if you get shaky,
I get shaky.

549
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,241
Go!

550
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,985
<i>What, are you crying?</i>

551
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,886
<i>Why are you crying?
That wasn't so bad.</i>

552
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,327
Pick up another Iog.

553
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,162
Hurry up, pick up another Iog.

554
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,957
Hurry up.

555
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,498
Put your hands up there.
Put your hands up there.

556
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,132
No.

557
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,232
Put--

558
00:52:58,207 --> 00:53:01,233
<i>We're friends.
We're having fun, right?</i>

559
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,878
Put your hands up there.

560
00:53:11,387 --> 00:53:13,321
Go!

561
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,711
Come here, IittIe girI.

562
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:21,682
You're my favorite girI.

563
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,369
<i>Catch them.</i>

564
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,412
<i>Kill them.</i>

565
00:57:37,553 --> 00:57:39,214
George.

566
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:45,186
I think there's something
seriousIy wrong here.

567
00:57:46,395 --> 00:57:48,522
Something's not right.

568
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,797
<i>What's not right?</i>

569
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,032
<i>We need to get out of here.</i>

570
00:57:57,206 --> 00:58:00,437
To just go. Just pack up and go.

571
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:04,005
No, no, no.

572
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:07,441
You know, you can't run away
from your probIems, Kath.

573
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:11,112
PIease, Iet's go, George.

574
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,856
- Somewhere. Anywhere.
- Did you hear that?

575
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,526
Do you hear that squeak?
I gotta fix that squeak.

576
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:23,730
Because, you know, these houses,
they're big....

577
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:28,333
Big projects. Kath, and you
can't just waIk away from it.

578
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,742
How did you get so fucking stupid?

579
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,846
<i>What?</i>

580
00:58:42,918 --> 00:58:46,911
Everything we have is in this house.
Everything.

581
00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:49,080
I'm not worried
about our goddamn money.

582
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,724
Oh, our money.

583
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,094
George, we're Iosing each other.

584
00:58:54,263 --> 00:58:56,197
Don't you see that?

585
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,491
<i>We stay here,
we'll have a house for the famiIy...</i>

586
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:01,829
...onIy there won't be a famiIy.

587
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,334
It's aIways so coId in here.

588
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,938
<i>WouId you Iet the stove aIone
and pay attention to me?</i>

589
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:13,877
I'm not going anywhere,
neither are you.

590
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,517
So shut up about that!

591
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,677
Just shut up!

592
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,577
Goddamn it.

593
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,387
You're the one who wanted
this godforsaken house.

594
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:23,889
<i>Well, now you got it.</i>

595
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,789
Mom! Mom!

596
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:28,188
Home sweet home.

597
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:33,462
<i>What is it, sweetie?</i>

598
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,900
<i>We can't find Harry anywhere.
He's gone.</i>

599
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,798
I'll heIp you Iook in a sec, sweetie.

600
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,000
You seen Harry, George?

601
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:44,702
No, I haven't, Billy.

602
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,411
Maybe he ran away.

603
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,052
Harry never runs away, George.

604
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,214
<i>What's the matter with you, William?</i>

605
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,948
Get out of here now.

606
00:59:56,125 --> 01:00:00,221
- Now!
- Fine. Come on, MichaeI.

607
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:31,353
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the HoIy Spirit.

608
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,770
- Hello?
- Is your mommy home?

609
01:00:47,943 --> 01:00:49,342
HoId on a second.

610
01:00:49,845 --> 01:00:51,938
Mommy, there's someone
at the door.

611
01:00:52,114 --> 01:00:53,638
<i>Who is it, honey?</i>

612
01:00:55,384 --> 01:00:56,681
Come in, Father.

613
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,358
This is gonna sound strange...

614
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:12,331
...but you know the doll with one eye
that your daughter is hoIding?

615
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:15,798
<i>Well, that beIonged to the IittIe girI
who Iived here before you.</i>

616
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,072
Yes, it was Ieft here.

617
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,209
No, Mrs. Lutz, it was not Ieft here.

618
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,471
Father, what exactIy
are you trying to tell me?

619
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:30,244
I knew the Defeos very well.
I presided over their funeraI.

620
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,378
Jodie Defeo was buried
with that doll.

621
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,261
Oh, heavenIy Father.

622
01:01:47,002 --> 01:01:48,993
AImighty God...

623
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:55,876
...we ask you to bIess...

624
01:01:57,479 --> 01:02:00,107
...and sanctify this house.

625
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:07,212
To bIess all who Iive here...

626
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:12,592
...and to bring them the abundance
of all thy fruits.

627
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,811
<i>Get out.</i>

628
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,516
Father!

629
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,351
Father!

630
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:21,085
<i>Why are you Ieaving us?</i>

631
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:23,527
<i>What's the matter?</i>

632
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:33,272
It's okay. I'm here.

633
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:57,890
<i>Catch them.</i>

634
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,591
<i>Kill them.</i>

635
01:04:05,874 --> 01:04:08,775
Oh, goddamn it, Harry!

636
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,338
<i>Catch them.</i>

637
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,010
<i>Kill them.</i>

638
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:44,937
<i>Catch them.</i>

639
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,374
<i>Kill them.</i>

640
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,311
<i>Catch them.</i>

641
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:28,080
<i>There was a crime. A murder.</i>

642
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:29,790
<i>You know, the town has moved on.</i>

643
01:05:29,958 --> 01:05:34,861
<i>And it is a distant memory now,
and the house is fine.</i>

644
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,967
<i>We don't open
for a few more minutes.</i>

645
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,820
''Voices toId him to do it.''

646
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,630
''He just moved into the basement.''

647
01:06:14,636 --> 01:06:17,002
''Twenty-eights days Iater
he killed them all.''

648
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:31,780
Oh, my God.

649
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:25,569
''Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham.''

650
01:07:36,418 --> 01:07:39,080
''He started a mission for Indians.''

651
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,828
''He sIaughtered them all.''

652
01:08:40,482 --> 01:08:43,918
''Over 20 bodies were found
in the Iake.''

653
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,133
<i>Catch them.</i>

654
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,465
<i>Kill them.</i>

655
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,065
Father.

656
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,233
<i>Why did you run away
from my house?</i>

657
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,236
<i>Why did you abandon us?</i>

658
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:49,146
Your house frightens me, Mrs. Lutz.

659
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,084
I just read about this man,
Ketcham...

660
01:09:56,658 --> 01:10:00,890
...who tortured Indians on my Iand.
On my basement.

661
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,797
I read about how he sIit his throat...

662
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:11,530
...so that his presence
wouId Iive forever.

663
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,039
Do you beIieve this couId be true?

664
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,675
Ronnie Defeo came to me
weeks before the murders...

665
01:10:17,846 --> 01:10:22,874
...and he spoke about hearing voices
and seeing things in the house.

666
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,716
I didn't beIieve him untiI yesterday.

667
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:32,183
Mrs. Lutz, get you and your famiIy
out of that house...

668
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,691
...right now.

669
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,337
<i>- Hello?
- George.</i>

670
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,808
<i>George, I've just been to see
Father Callaway.</i>

671
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:53,971
<i>Listen to me, you gotta get you
and the kids out of the house.</i>

672
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,584
<i>George?</i>

673
01:10:57,919 --> 01:10:59,443
<i>Are you there? George?</i>

674
01:11:13,034 --> 01:11:17,437
<i>Billy! MichaeI! Where's George?</i>

675
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,733
He's in the boathouse.

676
01:11:37,425 --> 01:11:40,656
George, we have
to get out of here now.

677
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,421
George!

678
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,171
Are you fucking crazy, George?

679
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:25,998
Have you Iost your mind?

680
01:12:26,174 --> 01:12:27,732
You tried to kill me.

681
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:35,814
- CheIsea!
- Mommy! Mommy!

682
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:37,349
I'm down here, Mommy!

683
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:41,247
CheIsea, honey,
what are you doing down here?

684
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:11,011
I think she misses her daddy.

685
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:15,880
Don't you?

686
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,090
Give me back my daughter.

687
01:13:24,799 --> 01:13:28,633
<i>I wanna taIk to you. Wait.
