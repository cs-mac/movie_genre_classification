Are you okay, Mom?

6
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:37,935
It's just a little stomach ache.

7
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:42,182
Can you keep an eye
on the baby while I lay down?

8
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:43,206
Yeah.

Something is wrong,
I need to go to the hospital.

23
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:22,742
You can't go to the hospital,
sweetheart.

00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:23,936
Why not?

25
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:28,582
It's time for the final step.

There's one more.

63
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:26,272
Oh, my parents flipped when
they found out I applied out of state.

64
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:29,309
But whatever, it's not like
they really have a say in what I do.

65

Man, you're so lucky.

What, Mary Mother of God
still callin' all the shots?

68

She thinks colleges are, uh,
morally corrupt breeding grounds.

69
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:41,977
Well, yeah.

[door slams]
Hey.

76
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:03,475
What?

77
00:11:04,677 --> 00:11:07,280
Hey, eventually my mom's
gonna start to notice.

78
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,679
Come on, she never notices.

79
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,151
She's gonna be home any minute,
so you gotta clear out.

80
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,353
Why?

81
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,288
Because you know I'm not
supposed to have friends over,

82
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:16,346
especially you.

83
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,279
Come on.

84
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,662
[sighs]
Typical.

85
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:24,163
What?

86
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:26,799
Have you ever had a thought
that she didn't feed you?

87
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,334
Uh, of course.

88
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,803
Yeah, uh, let me see
your cell phone real quick.

89
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:32,105
You know I don't have one.

90
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,940
Oh, right-- why is that again?

91
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,306
Because they cause brain tumors.

92
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,678
Bingo.

93
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:41,014
See, it's like you're
a weird little clone.

94
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:42,345
Good-bye, Scott.

95
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,853
[sighs] I'm gonna come back
and find you and her

96
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:49,048
running a creepy motel
right off the Interstate, aren't I?

97
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:52,553

00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:55,859
[Scott]
Get a TV.

99
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,418
This is Andrew Judson.

100
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:22,422
Hi, Mr. Judson, this is uh,
Johnny-- John Petrie.

101
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:24,891
Yes, yes, yes,
I've been waiting for you to call.

102
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:26,993
Yeah, I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

103
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:29,195
I don't know
any Benjamin Conroy.

104
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,597
Uh, it's no mistake,
the estate of Mr. Conroy

105
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:34,233
has been willed to you
as of your 18th birthday,

106
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:36,035
which was a few days ago,
if I'm correct.

107
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:38,104
Yeah, but uh, again I--

108
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:40,440
The property's worth
a substantial amount of money.

109
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,242
I really need to go over
all the logistics in person.

110
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:45,904
When's the soonest
you can come to Wellfield?

111
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,749
See, that's the thing,
I can't exactly just leave.

112
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:50,783
[keysjangle]

113
00:12:50,783 --> 00:12:52,216
- Uh, Mr. Judson, I'll call you back.
- Yes, of course, but--

114
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:55,747
Hi, Mom.

115
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,591
New doctor?

116
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:00,560
I ran into Helen Sampson today

117
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,129
and she told me about this new
medication her daughter was prescribed

118
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:05,264
for generalized anxiety
and mild depression.

119
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:09,202
Dr. Webster said it was too dangerous
to take with my Klonopin and Valium.

120
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:11,227
So, I went to Helen's doctor and--

121
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:14,640
he was more than happy
to prescribe it.

122
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,375
That's great.

123
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,434
That's the last time I see
that Webster quack.

124
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:25,718
Hey, Mom, can I talk to you
about something?

125
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:28,421
If this is about going to college
again, you can stop right there.

126
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:31,157
Those communal showers
are nothing but state sanctioned

127
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:32,992
homosexual bath houses.

128
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:35,728
No, I-- I was wondering
if I could go, uh--

129
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:37,597
to church?

130
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:40,666
Don't think I don't know how long
it's been since your last confession.

131
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,703
No, Mom, to this town.

132
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:45,671
It's called Wellfield.

133
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:46,899
It's in Maine.

134
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,175
Pardon me?

135
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:50,910
I got this letter today and--

136
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,112
You're not going anywhere,
do you you hear me?

137
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,581
I am your mother and I make
the rules around here.

138
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:57,083
So, not another word.

139
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,952
- But--
- Not another word.

140
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:01,510
Who's Benjamin Conroy?

141
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:22,175
- Are you Mary's son?
- Yes.

142
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,809
I wanted to hold her
for a few days

143
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,646
for a more thorough
psych evaluation.

144
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:29,877
Which, trust me,
sounds much worse than it is.

145
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,218
- A few days?
- [whispers] Yeah.

146
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:50,229
[ringing]

147
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:52,805
Mr. Judson?

148
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:55,467
[bells clanging]

149
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:07,211
[bell chiming]

150
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,916
Hey, man?

151
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:48,127
Hi.

152
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:49,862
You look a little lost.

153
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:50,963
No, I'm fine.

154
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:52,362
Sure about that?

155
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,136
Kind of looking
for this lawyer's office.

156
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,405
Well, Mr. John Petrie,

157
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,640
it's just around
the corner there.

158
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,774
Great, thank you.

159
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,542
If you want my advice,
which you do,

160
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:07,413
you'll turn around and get
your sorry ass back on that train.

161
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:08,447
Why would I do that?

162
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,548
Listen to him, okay?

163
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:10,708
Nobody wants you here.

164
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,821
Everything's been fine here
for 17 years.

165
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:18,291
You had no right coming back
and digging up the past!

166
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,656
Listen, I don't know
what you're talking about.

167
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:24,397
Hey.

168
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,299
Let him go, Mack.

169
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:30,236
Just so we're clear,
you don't belong in this town.

170
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:31,567
Understand?

171
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,669
See you around.

172
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:04,503
So, I'm glad you were able
to come up here so quickly.

173
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,138
The sooner we get
the ball rolling,

174
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:09,175
the sooner both of us can be
on our way to the bank.

175
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,472
Uh-huh.

176
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:13,836
Your mother was okay
with you coming up here?

177
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:19,550
Well, it's not like she really has
any say in what I do.

178
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,658
Mr. Judson, I've still got
a few questions.

179
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,717
Ah, here we are.

180
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,377
Just look at it.

181
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:45,811
Okay.

182
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:48,914
You have the house over here,
barn out back.

183
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:51,217
Property stretches
far into the woods over there

184
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:54,243
covering approximately
125 acres.

185
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:57,189
- Mr. Judson--
- I already have a developer lined up

186
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:59,191
who's been waiting years
to get a hold of the property.

187
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,260
So, I was able to negotiate
a great price--

188
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,420
pending your approval.

189
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,667
Wait, can you just--
hold on a second.

190
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,336
Yeah, what is it?

191
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:12,171
Who is Benjamin Conroy?

192
00:18:12,171 --> 00:18:15,207
I'm sorry, I just--
I just thought you knew.

193
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:16,742
No.

194
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:18,444
You should really talk
to your mother about this.

195
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:19,845
Trust me, it's not my place.

196
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,781
Look, I tried--
she wouldn't tell me.

197
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:23,582
More reason for me
not to get involved.

198
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,885
Please, I'm just trying
to figure out why I'm here.

199
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,113
[sighs]

200
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,847
Because you're next of kin
to the Conroy family.

201
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:33,592
Next of kin?

202
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:35,787
Was Benjamin
like a c-c-c cousin or somethin'?

203
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:39,532
No, not a cousin.

204
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:40,863
Well, what then?

205
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,439
Benjamin Conroy was--

206
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:48,202
Benjamin Conroy was your father.

207
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,309
[chuckles]

208
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,244
See, I knew this had
to be a mistake.

209
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:54,713
My father's name was Ed Petrie,
he died years ago.

210
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:57,783
Your mother...
was Benjamin's sister.

211
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:59,944
She adopted you after
your family passed away.

212
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:03,055
That's impossible,
I'd remember something like that.

213
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:04,488
You were only a year old.

214
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,719
[sighs] I'm sorry you had
to find out like this.

215
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,804
Hey.

216
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,272
I don't know how tame he is.

217
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:21,340
Get outta here!

218
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,077
Get, go, go,
get outta here, go, go!

219
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:27,179
You okay,
he didn't hurt you?

220
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,339
No, I'm fine.

221
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,183
Let's go see the house.

222
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,787
All right.

223
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:45,431
Had the power turned on
for showing the buyers.

224
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:48,267
I also had an antiques dealer
put a quote together,

225
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,536
assuming you want
to sell the furniture.

226
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:53,164
Minus a small percentage
for my finder's fee.

227
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,964
Is this my family?

228
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,710
Yes, I suppose so.

229
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,106
What happened to them?

230
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,784
Mr. Judson?

231
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:08,787
Honestly, I really don't know
that much about it.

232
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:10,311
Some kinda accident.

233
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:21,800
I have a four o'clock,
so we need to get going.

234
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,563
- Already?
- Yeah.

235
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:29,308
So, the property was
originally made in 1816.

236
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,377
Back then it sat on 400 acres.

237
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,208
It was originally farm country.

238
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:43,355
So, I booked you a room
at the hotel by my office.

239
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:46,415
So, we can meet tomorrow morning
and go over all the paperwork.

240
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:52,932
Actually...I was kind of thinkin'
that I might like to stay here

241
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,832
for a little longer.
[Judson chuckles]

242
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,269
Is that okay?

243
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:58,571
I mean, it is your house,

244
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:00,673
but I wouldn't suggest
poking around in there.

245
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:01,907
Why not?

246
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:05,070
It's just...it's not sanitary.

247
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:08,072
I'd like to stay.

248
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:11,680
I mean, I'm staying.

249
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,219
Fine.

250
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,555
Okay, here's my card,
[sighs]

251
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:19,124
the number for a cab service.

252
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:21,527
Give 'em a call
when you're done,

253
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:24,052
assuming you haven't caught
some sort of hepatitis by then.

254
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,401
[chuckles]

255
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:30,636
Enjoy.

256
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:32,194
- Thank you.
- I guess.

257
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:37,242
Oh, and uh, Johnny...
happy birthday.

258
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:45,117

Ow!

265
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:17,966
[sighs]

266
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:27,209
Great.

267
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,995
[phone ringing]

268
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:56,909
Hello?

269
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,911
Hi, John, it's Andrew Judson.

270
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:00,979
I just called to let you know
I had the line turned back on.

271
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,614
Oh, okay.

272
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:04,082
Thanks, Mr. Judson.

273
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:05,784
Is everything all right?

274
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:07,419
Yeah, everything's fine.

275
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:09,621
Okay, give me a call
if you need anything.

276
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:11,156
All right, I will.

277
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,457
I'll see you tomorrow.

278
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:13,788
Sounds good, thank you.

279
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:19,325
[thunk, creaking]

280
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,832
Hello?

[creaking]

283
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,728
Bryan Conroy.

[creaking]

285
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:54,052
Who's up there?

Hey!

290
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,024
Hello?

291
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:55,641
[door closes]

292
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,089
Can I help you?

293
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:05,852
I'm sorry I scared you.

294
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:09,227
I didn't think anyone
would be coming back,

295
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:10,819
so I kinda panicked.

296
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,065
Okay.

297
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:15,534
Though technically, I think
you're the one who barged in on me,

298
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:17,769
so I don't think I should be
the one apologizing.

299
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:19,404
Why, I didn't barge in, I--

300
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,173
You didn't exactly knock either,
did you?

301
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:22,507
No, I didn't knock--

302
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:25,203
Well, now that we've established that,
I'll be upstairs.

303
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:28,113
Hey!

304
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:29,548
Uh, who are you?

305
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:32,250
See, I should be asking you
the same question.

306
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,220
- Yeah, but this is my house.
- And?

307
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,089
Not looking for a roommate?

308
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:39,891
Not exactly, I'm supposed
to be selling it tomorrow.

309
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:42,127
If I wasn't mistaken,
that would be your way

310
00:29:42,127 --> 00:29:44,129
of telling me I had to leave.

311
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:46,231
Kind of-- sorry.

312
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,357
No worries.

313
00:29:48,934 --> 00:29:50,060
Whatever.

314
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:53,696
- No, wait, slow down.
- No, thanks.

315
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:55,764
Do you have a name?

316
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:58,443
I'm not a stray cat.

317
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:00,645
Of course I have a name.

318
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:02,714
Well, what is it?

319
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:05,951
- Emma.
- Emma, I'm Johnny.

320
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:07,119
I'm sure you are.

321
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,487
So, you've been living here?

322
00:30:08,487 --> 00:30:10,489
- You can say that.
- Why?

323
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:13,825
It's been abandoned for years,
I didn't think anyone would mind.

324
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:15,494
What, did you run away
or something?

325
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:16,962
Something.

326
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:18,054
Do you have anywhere to go?

327
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:20,492
All right, enough.

328
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,235
- What?
- With the questions, okay?

329
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,570
I'm sorry, I didn't expect
anybody to be here.

330
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,074
Well, I'm leaving, so you can go ahead
and pretend like it never happened.

331
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:30,006
Emma.

332
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:32,276
What?

333
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:37,415
Would you mind showing me
around the place before you take off?

334
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:39,349
I think you can handle it yourself.

335
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:41,419
Please?

336
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:42,750
I'd really appreciate it.

337
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:45,786
I suppose.
[pop]

338
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:48,827
Guess we'll start
with the basement.

339
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:50,658
I saw some bulbs
down there a while back.

340
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,434
[Johnny]
So, how long have you been here?

341
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:57,702
[Emma]
I don't know, a day or two.

342
00:30:57,702 --> 00:30:59,204
Watch your step.

343
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:02,435
I didn't think I'd witness the return
of the prodigal son, though.

344
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,177
What are you talking about?

345
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:07,111
You're the long lost Conroy, right?

346
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:09,708
Wait, you know who I am?

347
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,286
The whole town knows
who you are.

348
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:16,154
Or at least they think they do.

349
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:18,179
Why do they know about me?

350
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:21,459
[click]

351
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:22,949
Again with the questions.

352
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,709
Hey, Johnny.

353
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:53,057
- Sorry.
- Relax.

354
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:57,996
I was probably gonna be here
for a few more hours,

355
00:31:57,996 --> 00:31:59,497
if you wanted to stick around.

356
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:00,657
I don't know.

357
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,768
To be honest,
I could use the company.

358
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:05,429
I don't really know anybody
around here.

359
00:32:07,572 --> 00:32:09,267
Guess I don't have
anything else to do.

360
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,603
[footsteps]

361
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:16,340
Don't tell me there's somebody else
staying here too.

362
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:18,107
No.

363
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:08,797
Is there anybody up here?

364
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:31,286
[gasps]

365
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:34,259
The upstairs is empty.

366
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,094
Looks like the door blew open.

367
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:37,929
Oh.

368
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:42,332
Johnny...
do you believe in ghosts?

369
00:33:45,704 --> 00:33:47,605
You should see
your face right now.

370
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,163
Ohh.

371
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:01,982
[creaking]

372
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,290
Emma.

373
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:23,368
[sighs]

374
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:33,685
Hey.

375
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:35,320
You can smoke in the house
if you want to.

376
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,914
- I don't care.
- Shut up, I don't smoke.

377
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:40,817
Give me a push.

378
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:51,703
Have you been in the barn?

379
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:54,005
Gross, no.

380
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:56,166
Just looking at it gives me tetanus.

381
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:01,736
So, what are you going to do
when you sell this place?

382
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:06,384
Probably head back to the city,
finish school.

383
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:07,952
Maybe use the money
to go to college.

384
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:09,387
You're from New York?

385
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:11,256
Yeah, born and raised.

386
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:13,858
Well, raised.

387
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:14,950
Don't you love it?

388
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,796
You know, I honestly
never got out much,

389
00:35:17,796 --> 00:35:19,898
aside seeing
in school and church.

390
00:35:19,898 --> 00:35:22,196
Jesus, why the hell
do you want to go back?

391
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:25,364
I don't know.

392
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,862
Guess I always thought
I'd eventually have to.

393
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:32,401
If I were you, I'd just pick up
and start over.

394
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:37,449
New town, new place,
new name.

395
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:38,814
New everything.

396
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,320
Is that what you did?

397
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,446
Come on.

398
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:47,959
Where?

399
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,893
You said you wanted
to see the barn, right?

400
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:56,556
It's locked from the inside.

401
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,232
I think I can get in
from the top.

402
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:14,517
- You comin'?
- Absolutely not.

403
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,086
Caw!

404
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:26,126
Johnnie?

405
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:27,623
Yeah.

406
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,872
You gotta see this!

407
00:36:53,157 --> 00:36:54,784

Johnny?

412
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:17,434
Coming.

413
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:31,288
What's wrong?

414
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:33,381
I don't know.

415
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:36,494
There was someone
behind me.

416
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:37,586
Who?

417
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:41,666
Anything upstairs?

418
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:43,429
No, jus-- just junk.

- We should probably go inside.
- Yeah.

00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,152
Go on, get away!

423
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,286

Michael Coffit, please call 8-4-0.

431
00:40:01,512 --> 00:40:03,147
[female recording]
You've reached the Petrie's.

432
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:05,349
Please leave your name
and a brief message

433
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:07,985
and have a blessed day.
[beep]

Johnny, this is your mother again.

435
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:12,657
I don't know what kind
of joke you're playing,

436
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:14,325
but I expect you here first thing
in the morning

437
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,758
to get me out of this place!

438
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:18,191
[slam]

439
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:28,039
So, do you know anything
about my family?

440
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,407
That depends.

441
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:30,875
What do you already know?

442
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:32,274
That there was an accident.

443
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:35,246
I wouldn't exactly say that.

444
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:37,048
Well, what happened then?

445
00:40:37,048 --> 00:40:39,175
How should I know,
it's your family not mine.

446
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:41,753
I don't know.

447
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:45,120
I just felt connected to this place
from the second I got here.

448
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:50,528
There is this strong,
tragic energy, right?

449
00:40:50,528 --> 00:40:52,897
Just looking at the photos
you can tell.

450
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:55,263
At one point the Conroys
were happy.

451
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,973
Listen, it's getting pretty late.

452
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:03,407
I get it, time to go.

453
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:07,311
No, wait, I was gonna say
I'm spending the night, so...

454
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:09,040
if you wanted to stay another day.

Thanks.

00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:12,617
You're welcome.

457
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:13,818
What's wrong?

458
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:17,221
You know how I said I-- I thought I saw
someone outside earlier?

459
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:18,654
I think they're back.

- Sh-hh.

We ain't gonna hurt you!

What, you gotta be kidding me.

Wait, what are you gonna do?

00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,554
I'm calling the cops.

We just wanna hang out!

00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:38,636
There are people trying
to break into my house.

No, I'm not sure
of the address exactly.

477
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:41,505
It's-- it's the Conroy farm.

So, let us in this house.

somebody right away, please.

It's for the good of us all.

Thank you.

There's someone out back.

Henry Depford,
he used to be a sheriff up here.

512
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:54,762
Honestly, he's a pretty harmless guy.

513

You might want to tell him that.

514
00:44:57,675 --> 00:45:00,177
I think he wasjust trying
to scare you, is all.

515
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:03,442
Well, Henry became pretty
obsessed with this place,

uh, after he discovered
the bodies in the barn.

He found the bodies?

518
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:09,620
Yeah, Bryan, he's the one who found you
hidden in the basement that night.

00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,788
I'm sorry, what did you call me?

520

You're name's Bryan, right?

00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:14,982
Yeah, right, I'm sorry, I'm just, um--

I can understand that.

You stayin' up here by yourself?

Right, right.

Well, you want to press charges,
you come down to the station tomorrow--

No, no, it's okay.

529
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:30,474
Uh, can you just make sure
that he doesn't come back?

530
00:45:30,474 --> 00:45:31,575
I'll have a talk with him.

I can't believe you deliberately
disobeyed me like this.

You better get back here, Johnny!

No, I can't believe you didn't tell me.

Benjamin was an awful man.

I couldn't let you
grow up like that.

So, you lied to me instead?

I didn't lie to you, I just--

01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:46,342
I, Faith,

663
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:49,539
share the gift of the afterlife
with Bryan.

664
01:03:16,773 --> 01:03:17,740
[Benjamin]
Daniel?

665
01:03:20,376 --> 01:03:22,912
- Say it, Daniel.
-Johnny!

666
01:03:22,912 --> 01:03:24,971
Johnny!
What happened?

667
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:29,119
It was-- they were--
they were all right here, all of them.

668
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:30,620
- Calm down, okay?
- No.

669
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:31,988
There's no one here but us.

670
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:33,556
Just you and me.

671
01:03:33,556 --> 01:03:35,258
It was right in front of me,
I could feel it.

672
01:03:35,258 --> 01:03:37,060
I could feel his breath
on my face.

673
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,797
Just you and me, hear me?

674
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:44,096
[chimes continue]

675
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:38,110
[panting]

676
01:04:40,223 --> 01:04:42,358
[chimes continue]

677
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:43,825
[knocking]

678
01:04:45,028 --> 01:04:46,296
What is it?

679
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:47,320
Do you hearthat?

680
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:54,502
[knocking]

681
01:04:59,709 --> 01:05:01,142
[knocking]

682
01:05:03,179 --> 01:05:05,381
- Mr. Judson.
- Are you okay?

683
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:07,684
Yeah, I'm fine.

684
01:05:07,684 --> 01:05:08,918
I called the hotel this morning.

685
01:05:08,918 --> 01:05:10,220
They said you never
even checked in.

686
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:14,224
You-- you know, I lost track of time
and I decided to crash here.

687
01:05:14,224 --> 01:05:16,249
Well, it would have been helpful
if you'd called to let me know.

688
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:19,095
You're right, I'm sorry.

689
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:20,263
I should have.

690
01:05:20,263 --> 01:05:22,699
All right, well,
we're both here now.

691
01:05:22,699 --> 01:05:24,599
What do you say
we get down to business?

692
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:28,603
Um, sure.
Come on in.

693
01:05:41,618 --> 01:05:42,710
Hold on, hold on.

694
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:01,571
[sighs] The offer's well above
market value.

695
01:06:01,571 --> 01:06:03,973
So, probably, if I were you,

696
01:06:03,973 --> 01:06:06,203
I wouldn't even
bother negotiating.

697
01:06:08,278 --> 01:06:10,644
Just sign it,
be done with this dump.

698
01:06:12,248 --> 01:06:14,550
[sighs] Yeah, I mean,
I'm sure it's great.

699
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,053
Trust me, if you're holding out
for something better to come along,

700
01:06:17,053 --> 01:06:19,889
[scoffs] it will not be happening
in this economy.

701
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:22,925
I trust you,
it's just I'm not really sure.

702
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:26,329
I know, real estate can seem
like a daunting task sometimes.

703
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:29,162
But that's why I'm here,
walk you through it.

704
01:06:33,069 --> 01:06:35,138
What if I didn't want
to sell the house?

705
01:06:35,138 --> 01:06:36,439
Excuse me?

706
01:06:36,439 --> 01:06:39,609
I just-- I sort of feel obligated
to keep it.

707
01:06:39,609 --> 01:06:41,177
It's my family's home.

708
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:43,112
Johnny, you didn't even
know them.

709
01:06:43,112 --> 01:06:44,614
Yeah, I know that.

710
01:06:44,614 --> 01:06:47,650
Listen, kid, I took on this case
under the agreement

711
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,140
that I receive a percentage
of the sale.

712
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,188
I'm sorry, Mr. Judson.

713
01:06:52,188 --> 01:06:54,918
Then maybe you should rethink
making such a detrimental decision.

714
01:06:55,992 --> 01:06:58,290
[car approaching]

715
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:04,759
This is the last thing
that I need.

716
01:07:06,336 --> 01:07:07,637
Who is that?

717
01:07:07,637 --> 01:07:09,005
He's been harassing me.
[Judson sighs]

718
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:10,807
That's David Mackey.

719
01:07:10,807 --> 01:07:12,208
Mack.

720
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:16,312
Guess you could say he's your, uh...
half brother.

721
01:07:16,312 --> 01:07:17,301
What?

722
01:07:18,214 --> 01:07:22,151
Benjamin wasn't exactly the most...
faithful husband.

723
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:24,020
But don't worry, he doesn't have
any claim to the estate.

724
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,214
I'll handle it.

725
01:07:28,491 --> 01:07:29,719
My brother?

726
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:32,662
Hey, David.

727
01:07:32,662 --> 01:07:34,864
Yeah, this really isn't the time
or the place--

728
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:35,898
I just want to talk to him.

729
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:38,568
Yeah, from what I understand
you already talked to him yesterday.

730
01:07:38,568 --> 01:07:39,736
I want to talk to Bryan.

731
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:42,171
Uh, yeah, he goes by Johnny now.

732
01:07:42,171 --> 01:07:43,473
I want to talk to Bryan.

733
01:07:43,473 --> 01:07:44,667
Where'd Daniel put him?

734
01:07:47,677 --> 01:07:50,146
We can arrange a time,
a place, that's fine.

735
01:07:50,146 --> 01:07:52,014
Give me the baby, Daniel.

736
01:07:52,014 --> 01:07:53,216
Excuse me?

737
01:07:53,216 --> 01:07:54,550
[breathes heavily]

738
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:56,552
No, there's one more.

739
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:59,889
David, you really need
to get going now.

740
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:01,516
- Hi.
- Hey.

741
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:04,927
What's going on?

742
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:06,155
I'm not sure.

743
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:09,732
Give me the baby, Daniel!

744
01:08:09,732 --> 01:08:11,567
Bullshit!

745
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:12,702
[screams]
Oh, my God.

746
01:08:12,702 --> 01:08:13,903
David.

747
01:08:13,903 --> 01:08:15,370
It has to be finished.

748
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:19,330
[screams]

749
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:26,181
Jesus!

750
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,725
Bryan!

751
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:01,143
Behind the door.

752
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:07,156
[screaming]

753
01:09:07,156 --> 01:09:08,316
Emma!

754
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:11,227
[Emma yells]

755
01:09:11,227 --> 01:09:14,464
Hey, just-- just let her go.

756
01:09:14,464 --> 01:09:16,056
I don't want her.

757
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:19,299
There's one more.

758
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:47,830
Help me, please!

759
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:49,432
I'm sorry!

760
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:51,434
Save our souls, Bryan!

761
01:09:51,434 --> 01:09:53,425
Ah!
[clunk]

762
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:07,517
Hey, are you okay?

763
01:10:07,517 --> 01:10:08,950
Yeah, are you okay?

764
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:12,021
He's dead.

765
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:13,356
We gotta call the cops.

766
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:14,557
You can't.

767
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:15,992
We have to.

768
01:10:15,992 --> 01:10:17,186
No, Johnny, you can't.

769
01:10:20,796 --> 01:10:22,532
Judson had a--
had a cell phone.

770
01:10:22,532 --> 01:10:23,794
I'll go get it.

771
01:10:38,347 --> 01:10:39,916
He was right there.

772
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:42,214
Come on, Johnny,
let's go inside.

773
01:10:45,688 --> 01:10:46,655
Hey!

774
01:10:47,823 --> 01:10:49,025
What are you doing back?

775
01:10:49,025 --> 01:10:51,594
What the hell did you do
with the bodies out there?

776
01:10:51,594 --> 01:10:53,027
I didn't touch the bodies.

777
01:11:00,736 --> 01:11:01,930
[click]

778
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:04,607
What's going on?

779
01:11:04,607 --> 01:11:06,375
Look, I've been
investigating this case

780
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:08,843
since even after they forced me
into retirement.

781
01:11:10,446 --> 01:11:12,181
So, you know what happened?

782
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:14,684
Yeah, I was there.

783
01:11:14,684 --> 01:11:17,420
Your father was convinced
that there was a code in the Bible

784
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:20,389
that-- that somehow linked
the resurrection of Jesus

785
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:22,525
to the Egyptian God Osiris--

786
01:11:22,525 --> 01:11:24,686
that he used it to rise
from the dead.

787
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:27,563
I found his Bible last night.

788
01:11:27,563 --> 01:11:29,398
Well, there was only one problem.

789
01:11:29,398 --> 01:11:31,067
They never completed the ritual.

790
01:11:31,067 --> 01:11:34,870
And so your family
is now trapped in limbo.

791
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,132
Wait!

792
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:38,240
Why?

793
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,775
They want the last survivor.

794
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,277
Look, trust me.

795
01:11:41,277 --> 01:11:43,379
Until they have finished
what they've started,

796
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:45,081
their souls can't move on.

797
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:47,316
Your father told me
there was one more.

798
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:50,119
One more?
That's what Mack said.

799
01:11:50,119 --> 01:11:52,221
Right now, they're out
looking for hosts.

800
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:54,890
Now, the living,
they're very hard to control.

801
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:56,983
But the dead,
free for the taking.

802
01:11:57,994 --> 01:11:59,295
What can I do to help?

803
01:11:59,295 --> 01:12:02,465
[sighs] Years ago,
your brother Daniel saved your life

804
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:04,233
by hiding you in the basement.

805
01:12:04,233 --> 01:12:07,634
And maybe if we contact him,
he'll do it again.

806
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:15,000
[cawing]

807
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:41,133
[Johnny]
Something's happening.

808
01:12:42,038 --> 01:12:43,096
What?

809
01:12:45,174 --> 01:12:47,506
Oh, we better hurry.

810
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,241
[Depford] We need
the quality of the sitters.

811
01:13:32,588 --> 01:13:34,249
Something that belongs to us.

812
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:45,992
[clink]

813
01:14:04,353 --> 01:14:05,377
[clink]

814
01:14:07,089 --> 01:14:08,556
And the purpose.

815
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,060
Now what?

816
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:24,640
The dead sometimes send a marker
to connect them to the living.

817
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,574
Um, a gift.

818
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:29,910
Did you receive
anything like that?

819
01:14:49,064 --> 01:14:50,833
[sighs]

820
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:54,633
Well, we couldn't have picked
a better location.

821
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:01,175
Well, do we hold hands now
or something?

822
01:15:03,913 --> 01:15:08,748
No, uh...
wejust wait.

823
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:17,186
Daniel, are you there?

824
01:15:28,971 --> 01:15:30,165
Daniel?

825
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,844

Daniel, please.

Fifth what?

832
01:16:57,559 --> 01:16:59,929
Fifth nail, what does that mean?

833
01:16:59,929 --> 01:17:01,463
I've heard about it before--

834
01:17:01,463 --> 01:17:03,866
in school-- it-- it--
it's supposed to go in the heart

835
01:17:03,866 --> 01:17:06,235
during a crucifixion
to end suffering.

836
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:07,736
It was withheld from Jesus.

837
01:17:07,736 --> 01:17:11,228
They Conroys only had...
four nails each.

838
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:14,709
There's one more.

839
01:17:16,745 --> 01:17:19,381
It wasn't you, it was the nail.

840
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:21,083
Then why are they
still after me?

841
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:23,252
Benjamin Conroy

842
01:17:23,252 --> 01:17:26,588
pledged the entire family
to Osiris.

843
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:28,757
He has to fulfill his promise.

844
01:17:28,757 --> 01:17:30,486
But before he died,

845
01:17:31,327 --> 01:17:33,729
he didn't want
to finish the ritual.

846
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:35,731
He wanted to end it.

01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:49,578
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to see my baby.

I'm so sorry for everything,
I shouldn't have come.

01:18:04,693 --> 01:18:06,028
You're not my mother.

01:18:06,028 --> 01:18:07,129
Yes, she is.

859
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:09,865
I am, Bryan,
I am your mother.

860
01:18:09,865 --> 01:18:11,633
It's time you joined
your real family.

01:18:11,633 --> 01:18:12,668
No.

862
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:14,370
Don't you want to live
for ever, Bryan?

863

Faith, we can all get
what we want here tonight.

All I want is my baby back.

Share the gift
of the afterlife with me.

We're all meant to be together.
