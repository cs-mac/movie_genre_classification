1
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:35,303
Hello?

2
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:55,459
I'm home!

3
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,768
Mom!

4
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,034
Dad!

5
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,778
Bethany?

6
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,611
Ah!

7
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,920
Mom?

8
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,877
Beth?

9
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:58,544
Bethany?

10
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:03,649
It's me, Cole.

11
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,015
Ahh!

12
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,657
Did you do this?

13
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,861
Who did?

14
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,262
He who walks behind the rows.

15
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:20,395
He said to slay
the righteous with the wicked.

16
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,065
Where is he?
Just tell me where he is.

17
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,572
Don't move!

18
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,987
- Don't make me do it.
- Baby killer.

19
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,420
- Get back!
- Baby killer.

20
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,959
You're a baby killer. Baby killer.

21
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:44,892
Don't make me do it, not again.

22
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,395
Baby killer!

23
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,662
Baby killer.

24
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,722
Baby...

25
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,494
Baby killer. Baby killer!

26
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,032
Get a grip on yourself,
soldier.

27
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:58,998
Baby killer.

28
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:00,432
Baby killer.

29
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,308
Baby killer.

30
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:31,473
Guilty.

31
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,639
And a child shall lead them.

32
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm so hot.

33
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:51,676
And not in a good way.

34
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,009
It shouldn't be much longer.

35
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,519
It's been over an hour,
and not a single car has passed by.

36
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:59,112
We're still in California,
there have to be cars.

37
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,886
Nice bit of deductive
reasoning. Well done.

38
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:07,095
What if we pour the rest of the
water in the radiator?

39
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:11,760
Which will get us, what, 40 feet maybe?
Then we'd be stranded and without water.

40
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,137
Here.

41
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,400
Stay hydrated.

42
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,138
You're drinking for two now, baby.

43
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:25,673
Oh, God.

44
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,742
I'm gonna puke.

45
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,254
And so much for hydration.

46
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,182
Oh, God.

47
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,824
There's some telephone poles,
maybe a house.

48
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,592
Stay here, I'll run up
and call for a tow.

49
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:44,497
You kidding? I'm not gonna
stay here and fly like an egg.

50
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:45,762
You sure you can handle the walk?

51
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,899
I'm pregnant, I'm not dying.

52
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:52,598
All right, then.
Let's go make some friends.

53
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,787
- Thanks, by the way.
- For what?

54
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:16,924
For not telling me what a limp
dick I am for taking the scenic route.

55
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,196
I'm still allowed to think it,
right?

56
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,862
Oh, yeah, it's cool.

57
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,745
I like it. Meth-lab chic.

58
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,218
Let's be nice. Definitely do not
want to antagonize the natives.

59
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,251
If the worst should happen,

60
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:42,883
tell Little Bubba that his father
was a great but flawed man.

61
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:44,928
- Our kid's gonna be named Little Bubba?
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:45,984
OK.

63
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,149
Howdy.

64
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,191
I'm Tim Gleason
and this is my wife, Allie.

65
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,964
We hate to bother you, sir,
but our car broke down in the heat

66
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,232
- and we were wondering...
- Can't help you.

67
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:32,901
We don't need any help, just the
use of your phone to call for a tow.

68
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,036
Ain't got no phone.

69
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:41,116
Thanks anyway. Sony to bother you.

70
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,915
Excuse me, just one more thing.
Since we're without wheels,

71
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,456
can you tell us how far it is
to your nearest neighbor

72
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,513
or nearest...

73
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,150
...anything?

74
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,330
It be very far.

75
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:58,195
- You sure you don't have a phone?
- He just said he didn't.

76
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,794
That sure looks a lot like
a phone line to me.

77
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,502
Let's go, Allie.
Don't make a big deal out of this.

78
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,099
It's cool, we'll find another way.
It's all good.

79
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,076
it's not all good, it's 120
degrees.

80
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,806
We'll find a ride,
OK? Let's go.

81
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,075
- Just let me talk to him.
- No, you heard him. We're going.

82
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:13,639
Why? 'Cause he might be
a tweaker with a shotgun?

83
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:15,742
Could you say that any louder?

84
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:19,755
Sir? Hi.
We both know you have a phone...

85
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:23,290
- Asshole!
- Take it easy.

86
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:24,986
- What is his problem?
- Let it go.

87
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,428
If I have a miscarriage,
it's your fault!

88
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,989
- Let's go. We're sorry!
- No, we're not!

89
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:42,042
All right, you get yourself on in here.

90
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,743
It wouldn't be right to leave a woman
in your condition out here in the heat.

91
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,812
Wouldn't be Christian.

92
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,190
So I'm Tim and this is Allie.

93
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,834
Helen.

94
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,845
And this is my husband, Cole.

95
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:56,449
But everyone around calls him Preacher.

96
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,283
Your accent. Um, Romanian?

97
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:02,689
Ukraine.

98
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:05,861
How long have you been in the states?

99
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:13,300
Six years, almost.

100
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:19,273
Pretty cool flat-screen you got there.

101
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,174
You folks own dish
or cable out here?

102
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,576
We ain't got neither.

103
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,740
Just watch videos, huh?

104
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:30,444
That's pretty much all you need now that
The Sopranos is dead and buried.

105
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,517
I better make that call.
Uh, where's your phone?

106
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,122
I will show you.

107
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,367
Thanks.

108
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:59,211
I imagine everything's long distance
from here, so here,

109
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,308
- let me leave a little.
- Hundred.

110
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,511
Dollars?

111
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:04,952
That's a bit steep for a phone call, no?

112
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,780
Fifty, whatever you have spare.

113
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,502
- Please don't tell my husband.
- OK, sure.

114
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:28,307
- Do you have any pot?
- What? No.

115
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,576
- Cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

116
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,804
We're going to see Tim's
grandfather. He lives in Victorville.

117
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,037
Well, just north of Victorville.

118
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,104
He's not doing well.

119
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:08,981
Tim thought it would be a cool idea
if we took the scenic route.

120
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,713
Always a good idea, right?

121
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:21,095
So... you're pregnant?

122
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:26,694
Yeah... first time.

123
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:30,831
Well, second time, really,
but the first time didn't take.

124
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:34,173
Although I hardly thought of it
as a first time.

125
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:35,643
More like a false start.

126
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,674
But this time it just feels...

127
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:43,051
It just feels kind of... different.

128
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,621
Yeah, we're out on Salt Valley Road.

129
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:52,285
It's about 140 miles
east of Victorville.

130
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,762
No, Salt Valley.

131
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,061
- I don't see Salt Valley...
- Sony?

132
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,499
it's not for service here.

133
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,468
- Sure you got that right?
- I'm...

134
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,269
Is there another name?

135
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:07,538
Old Mine Road.
Nobody calls it Salt Valley any more.

136
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,042
- Old Mine Road.
- That's quite a ways from here.

137
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,517
- Sure love the quiet.
- There's nothing like it in LA.

138
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:42,806
- I... I just thought I saw...
- The heat'll do that to you.

139
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,821
- Hello?
- Take me with you.

140
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,881
- Mead's Auto Service?
- Mm-hmm.

141
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:00,393
- Is...
- What can I help you with?

142
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:05,730
- We're broken down on Old Mine Road.
- Old Mine?

143
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,365
Out past where
the road turns to dirt there?

144
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,837
- Uh, yeah.
- What seems to be the problem?

145
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,447
Radiator. Yeah.

146
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:24,146
- It's shot?
- The hose is busted for sure.

147
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:28,413
Be a while before we
can get someone over there.

148
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:32,361
Late evening, early morning.

149
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,829
- How much?
- Nine hundred plus road tax.

150
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,527
- You have AAA ?
- No...

151
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,531
No, I'll have to get back to you.

152
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,767
We 're here 'til six.

153
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,986
You know, it's really hard to get
sweet iced tea in LA.

154
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,792
You have to especially ask for it.

155
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,707
Well?

156
00:18:27,772 --> 00:18:29,479
OK, two options.

157
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,078
We catch a tow out of Inyokern.

158
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:36,523
- Three hours each way, 900 dollars.
- Nine hundred dollars?

159
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:40,051
Plus service cost at double-time
since it's a Sunday.

160
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,564
Extortion, yeah, I Know.

161
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:46,159
Not only that, their one car is on a run
and won't be back until this evening,

162
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:48,830
which means he can't even get here
until 2:00am at the earliest,

163
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:50,600
and possibly not at all.

164
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,073
All because of one stupid hose.

165
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,442
And the good option?

166
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,177
That was a good option.

167
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:04,914
Burrelson's Garage, which is less than
an hour away, is closed on Sundays.

168
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:06,683
As luck would have it.

169
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:11,785
What about our Mr. Pritchett?

170
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:16,889
He's coming in the morning. He
could give them a ride to Burrelson's.

171
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:26,635
All right.

172
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,668
Pritchett?

173
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,943
He comes every Monday morning
around seven.

174
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,245
I'm sure he would be happy
to give you a ride.

175
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,011
A very nice man.

176
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,817
We could pick up a
radiator hose at Burrelson's,

177
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,724
hitch back and save on the tow.
Get away for pocket change.

178
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,627
I'd hate to be a burden.

179
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,096
It's not a burden.

180
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,264
That's what our lord commands.

181
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,710
Well, now, that was perfect.

182
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:17,121
Actually, I became a vegan
about a year ago,

183
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,163
and I plan on staying that way
through the pregnancy.

184
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:24,223
And probably even
as long as I'm nursing.

185
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:39,371
Did you hear that?

186
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,775
The wind gets very strong here.

187
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:10,008
Now, the spare room, such as it is,

188
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,446
is right through that door, there.

189
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,040
I'm sure it'll be fine.

190
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,444
More than fine.

191
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:18,745
Please let me do the dishes,
it's the least...

192
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,317
You let Helen do that.

193
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,398
Please, it's how I relax.

194
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:33,427
OK, if you insist.

195
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,770
The outhouse is outside
through the front door.

196
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:47,449
If you need running water,
you can get that at the kitchen sink.

197
00:21:47,505 --> 00:21:48,506
Got it.

198
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:53,116
We are very private people here.

199
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:59,455
And we expect that
you will respect that privacy.

200
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:00,825
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

201
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:05,664
So don't go wandering around outside
except to go to the outhouse.

202
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:11,333
And do not go anywhere
that you are not invited.

203
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:13,708
Understood.

204
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,690
OK, tell me if I'm off here,

205
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:42,135
but freaky old hermit buys himself
a Russian wife off of the Internet

206
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:44,764
and she thinks, "Woo-hoo,
California, here I come,"

207
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:47,867
but winds up so far off the grid
that she might as well be on Mars.

208
00:22:47,932 --> 00:22:50,242
Then she hits on a stranded motorist
in the kitchen

209
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:53,339
while his pregnant wife is getting
the evil eye from freaky hermit guy.

210
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:55,475
Are you kidding?
Are you sure she...

211
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,486
Gave me a reach around
while I was on the phone?

212
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,887
And sitting on the kitchen table,
skin hiked up, legs open,

213
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:03,619
blouse open to her nipples? Yeah.

214
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,092
But who am I to judge? Maybe that's
how people cool off around here.

215
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:08,596
Jesus Christ.

216
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,566
No, I think that's freaky
hermit guy's department.

217
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:15,400
That is when he's not making porn videos
with his wife doing stranded motorists

218
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,771
- and selling them on the Internet.
- You really think that he's...

219
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,504
Why would he have all that video
equipment with no TV hook-up?

220
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,070
Dude's not making a living
growing tumbleweeds

221
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:27,480
- or selling corn-husk dolls.
- I know. That is so freaky, right?

222
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,682
Ooh, I'm really getting
creeped out here.

223
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:42,090
OK, and that doesn't help either.
This really, really sucks.

224
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:44,099
I'm not the one
who insisted on coming inside.

225
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:47,068
Really, then why am I pregnant?

226
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:57,872
- Even the cracks are little crosses.
- Stop it.

227
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:02,547
- Damn.
- What?

228
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,609
Shouldn't have drank all that iced tea.

229
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,667
You gotta be kidding me.

230
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,259
All right...

231
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,104
Are you all right?

232
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,377
Don't be afraid.

233
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:36,149
I'm not going to hurt you.

234
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:42,351
What's your name?

235
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:44,991
Mine's Allie.

236
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:45,347
Grant me one hour
and I will till the soil.

237
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:51,224
Grant me one day
and I will plant the seeds.

238
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,091
Grant me one year
and I will reap thy harvest.

239
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,026
It's worse. it's way worse
than we thought, OK?

240
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,096
He's got a kid locked up in the
storage shed and he's out in the garage.

241
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:05,538
- The kid?
- No, Preacher.

242
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:08,543
He's out in the garage, which he
turned into a church or a sex den,

243
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:11,910
just chanting weird shit about planting
and harvesting like some freaky...

244
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,643
- Slow down.
- No, listen, we gotta get out of here.

245
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:17,117
Tonight. But we gotta
take that kid with us.

246
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:19,745
We can't leave him here
with that sick bastard.

247
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,380
I want to kill him,
I just wanna kill him!

248
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:24,187
- Hang on, slow down. Deep breaths.
- Don't patronize me.

249
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:26,489
He's some fucking psycho
fucking pervert

250
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,552
like those other
sick fucks you read about.

251
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,601
- 911, OK? We gotta call 911.
- I'll do it.

252
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:34,932
Just... We need to get
our shit together first.

253
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:37,905
You think I'm imagining this?

254
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,032
I'm just saying...

255
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:43,304
Remember that time you heard the bears
attacking the tent in Kings Canyon?

256
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:44,710
Yeah, what does that
have to do with this?

257
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,544
Turned out they were squirrels.

258
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,982
- You don't believe me.
- I do, but we need to be specific.

259
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:56,184
They're gonna ask me questions.
Did you... Did you see the kid?

260
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,421
No, but I heard him.
I definitely heard him.

261
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:01,588
Yeah, but actually see him?
Did you see who was in the shed?

262
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:04,098
- It was padlocked, OK?
- OK! OK, so maybe...

263
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,795
- Maybe what?
- Could it have been...? I mean...

264
00:32:06,857 --> 00:32:08,268
- What did you hear?
- Crying.

265
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:12,102
- Helen.
- No, it wasn't a woman crying in there,

266
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,734
it was a little boy
or little girl, a child.

267
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:17,269
Imagine if it was our child.

268
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:20,713
- What if it was our child?
- OK, OK, OK. I'll call for help

269
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:22,751
- Thank you.
- You say Preacher's in the garage?

270
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,445
He was, I don't know about now.

271
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,954
You stay here, watch the window.
If you see him coming back...

272
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,012
what?

273
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,326
Never mind, just stay put.
I'll take care of it.

274
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,623
- No, what if he catches you?
- I can take him if I have to.

275
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:36,631
- You don't know that, he's big.
- I took a judo class in high school.

276
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,131
Tim...

277
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,395
Oh, shit.

278
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,971
Goddamn it.

279
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:46,917
Ahh!

280
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,155
You scared the shit out of me.

281
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,098
Did you see him?
Did you see the little kid?

282
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,969
- Yeah, all it is is little close-ups.
- No, he was just in here.

283
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:58,028
What?

284
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,703
Holy shit, what's with the blood?

285
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:04,807
There's all sons of broken glass
and rusty nails out there.

286
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:06,609
He might still be in here.

287
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:16,288
Oh, God, he's coming.
You did make the call, right?

288
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,417
Right?

289
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:20,519
- No, not yet, I...
- Un-fucking-believable.

290
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:23,463
- Where are you going?
- Just make the call.

291
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:33,741
Hey, I...

292
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:37,506
I was wondering if you could wait on
the porch while I go to the outhouse.

293
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,879
It's dark and I'm a bit scared
to be out there by myself.

294
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,984
- Ain't you already been out there?
- No.

295
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,823
I've been kind of holding it.

296
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,530
Last time I was in
an actual outhouse, I was a kid

297
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,401
and we were visiting a state park...

298
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,000
My brother pulled open the door and
shoved me inside and held it closed,

299
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,740
so you can see why I'm still a bit...

300
00:36:12,736 --> 00:36:14,272
...freaked by...

301
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:22,350
I... I was out once... already.

302
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:29,392
Why? Did you go to the shed?

303
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,488
I didn't.

304
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,693
- I just... went to the outhouse and...
- Oh...

305
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:40,041
Ain't no water out there,
except where that hose leaks,

306
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:44,102
and that's right... by the shed.

307
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,646
Stop.

308
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,450
I didn't mean to, I was...

309
00:36:53,877 --> 00:36:57,552
I... There were these noises,
and I just...

310
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,924
What noises were there?

311
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:03,491
I... I don't know, I...

312
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:06,194
I don't know.

313
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:09,829
I thought I heard something,
but I went to check, and... ow.

314
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:14,068
What did I tell you...

315
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:19,379
...about sneakin' around?!

316
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:35,594
You have no idea.

317
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,829
I know there's a kid
you keep in the shed back there.

318
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,699
And you film him, I know that much.

319
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,935
But you're right, I don't know any more
than that and I don't want to know.

320
00:37:45,996 --> 00:37:48,943
I just want to get through the night

321
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,536
and be on our way when the
delivery guy shows up, that's all.

322
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,673
I don't believe you.

323
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:56,877
We go "don't ask, don't tell."

324
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,749
And, in the morning,
the second we're gone,

325
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,914
you make sure that kid
is out of the shed.

326
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,720
You delete these cards,
throw some bleach on the floor there

327
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,658
- and it's our word against yours.
- Tim.

328
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:09,664
Our word against yours,
and not a stitch of evidence.

329
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,496
You think I'm in the grip of evil.

330
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,863
I didn't say that.

331
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:18,135
I'm fighting evil.

332
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:25,938
And you...

333
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,477
You go back to your room... right now.

334
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:38,882
Her real name is Oksana.

335
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,122
And she deceived me.

336
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:48,003
She told me that she could tell
from my letters that I was a good man,

337
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:53,667
and there were very
few good men in her country.

338
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,440
But she didn't tell me
that she was pregnant.

339
00:38:59,703 --> 00:39:03,617
That all she wanted was the chance

340
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,247
for her son to be born on American soil.

341
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,689
Evil finds evil.

342
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:14,422
Your wife and her son,
you think they're evil?

343
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,023
Oh, no, she was just a mother

344
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:22,662
and like every mother,
she wanted what was best for her child.

345
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:28,267
But I have forgiven her deceit
as God commands.

346
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,612
How can you condemn her child
when he's only five years old?

347
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:34,944
He's not her child.

348
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,280
- Not any more.
- I thought you said he...

349
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:39,579
Oh.

350
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,920
I'm from Gatlin, Nebraska.

351
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,819
The people in Gatlin,

352
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:50,059
they know more about certain things...

353
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:55,597
...certain unspeakable things

354
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,400
than you could even imagine.

355
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:06,671
Things like how easy it is
to corrupt a poor child's soul

356
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:11,550
or even just to
steal that soul outright.

357
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:17,250
If I hadn't been in the Army
and stationed overseas

358
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,693
when the massacre happened,
I'd be dead now

359
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:25,757
like all the rest of my friends
and my family.

360
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,136
Every single adult in Gatlin...

361
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:35,170
...was slaughtered by children.

362
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:40,611
Good children. Christian children.

363
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,810
You tell me, Mr. Gleason.

364
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,786
What could make a child
do something like that?

365
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:56,956
- 911, what's the emergency?
- Hi, we've been...

366
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,861
Well, it seems that uh...

367
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:08,069
...you too, have a deceitful wife.

368
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,148
- What happened?
- The phone, it just...

369
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,745
- How?
- I don't know.

370
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,553
- Did you get through?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

371
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,760
It's alright, it's OK, it's OK.

372
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,126
Why the hell didn't you make the call?
You had the time.

373
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,461
I was trying to put the camera
on the stand so he wouldn't know.

374
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:33,396
- Now it's too late.
- I'm sorry.

375
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:37,337
- One thing... You had one thing to do.
- I know, I know.

376
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,635
- Let's go. Let's just go.
- It's the middle of the night.

377
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:42,506
- Where are we gonna go?
- I don't know. I don't care,

378
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,172
- just... Please, let's just go.
- All right, come on.

379
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:53,747
Ah!

380
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:54,811
Tim.

381
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,181
Don't try and stop us.

382
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,055
Oh, God...

383
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:06,568
- Who's doing this?
- I told you, but you didn't listen.

384
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:08,525
Come on.

385
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:13,774
They never do.

386
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:20,510
- What the fuck?!
- Something in this house

387
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,880
- doesn't want us to leave.
- Damn it, like what?

388
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:25,351
- A poltergeist? A ghost?
- I don't know!

389
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,461
The same thing happened with the phone,
it just jerked out of my hand.

390
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,860
This house is rigged.

391
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,263
Pastor thinks he's David fucking Blaine.

392
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:41,427
- That's not it.
- Well, what is it then?

393
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:43,664
- You won't believe me.
- Try me.

394
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:47,197
Someone in this house is psychokinetic,
like off the charts.

395
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,265
Who? The kid?

396
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:53,007
Or Preacher or Helen/Oksana or whoever,
someone we don't even know about yet.

397
00:42:57,307 --> 00:42:58,308
Tim!

398
00:43:00,243 --> 00:43:01,551
- Oh, my God!
- I'm OK.

399
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:04,319
It wants you to return to your room.

400
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:09,762
You, the deceitful wife and you,
the cheating husband.

401
00:43:10,787 --> 00:43:14,530
Don't worry, it'll release you at dawn.

402
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,029
I hope.

403
00:43:25,902 --> 00:43:28,906
"I hope?" "I hope?"
What the hell does that even mean?

404
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:33,413
I'm sorry, we'll get through this.
I promise you, we'll get through...

405
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,084
Allie?

406
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:39,927
- You lied to me.
- What?

407
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:43,863
- No, what are you talking about?
- You fucked her, didn't you?

408
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:49,470
How can you say that? Because of
what that lunatic said? You believe him?

409
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,871
Just tell me yes or no.

410
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:56,672
- Did you fuck her in the kitchen?
- I told you what happened.

411
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:58,178
And that's all?

412
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,710
I know that everything's
going insane right now,

413
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,183
but that's no reason for us
to start doubting each other, OK?

414
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:07,313
My God, all we have is each other
right now. You gotta hang on to that.

415
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,587
- You didn't touch her?
- God, no!

416
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:25,397
You fucking pig.
You spineless fucking pig!

417
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,135
How could you do this to me?!

418
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:30,201
I don't know what you think you know
or saw, but you gotta believe me...

419
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,302
Fuck you!

420
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,742
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

421
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,553
Wait.

422
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,728
Wait.

423
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,439
The police. You got through!

424
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:25,504
- Hey! Officer!
- Help us!

425
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,806
- Officer, please look over here!
- Hey!

426
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:33,870
Hello!

427
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:46,160
- Hey! Over here!
- Officer! Hello!

428
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:48,253
- Look over here!
- What are you doing?

429
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,457
- Why can't he hear us?
- I don't know...

430
00:49:54,023 --> 00:49:56,469
- Here! Hey!
- Please!

431
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:59,132
What the hell's wrong with you?
Look over here, damn it!

432
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:02,540
- Please! Mr. Police Officer!
- Hey! Look over here, we're here!

433
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,339
Hey, cop!

434
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:30,702
This isn't happening.
It's not happening.

435
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,899
Did you see them slip anything
into our food or the tea?

436
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:35,875
- A hallucinogenic or something?
- No, not that I could tell.

437
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:38,469
Think. Anything odd or out-of-place
when we first got here?

438
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,845
Everything was odd and out-of-place.

439
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:47,887
What if... What if we're dead?
What if we never got out of the car?

440
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:51,858
Like what? We're still dead on the
roadside? From what?

441
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,156
I don't know. Accident?
Heat stroke? I don't know.

442
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,528
No, I'm not going there. There's gotta
be a better explanation than that.

443
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:01,729
We pounded on the window. The cop,
he should have heard us, seen us.

444
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,795
- There's no way he could've missed us.
- If he was even really there at all.

445
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:08,001
You saw what happened. That shit
just does not happen in waking life.

446
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:12,274
So we're dreaming.
Asleep and dreaming.

447
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,678
No, I didn't say that.

448
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:17,783
- No, we're not dreaming.
- How can you know for sure?

449
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,878
Look, we can sit here and run through
every pop-culture explanation you want,

450
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,891
but that is not gonna help us.
That is not gonna get us out of here.

451
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:27,054
Helen. We gotta talk to Helen.

452
00:51:27,116 --> 00:51:28,493
We gotta get her side of this.

453
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:30,997
We gotta get her away from Preacher,
she's a completely...

454
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:33,524
I'm just trying to get us out of here.

455
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:38,505
No. I'll talk to her,
you just get her away from her husband.

456
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,275
Preacher, I need to talk to you.

457
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,877
I know you're in there,
I need to talk to you now.

458
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,911
- I need to talk to your husband.
- He doesn't want to speak with you.

459
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,456
I don't give a shit.

460
00:51:57,947 --> 00:52:00,188
You're only going to make it angry.

461
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,653
I already made it angry,
and I'm still here.

462
00:52:06,322 --> 00:52:10,099
- Not for long.
- Is that a threat, or a premonition?

463
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:12,435
Or are you just trying
to fuck with my head again?

464
00:52:12,495 --> 00:52:14,338
Not to mention my wife's.

465
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,088
- Come here.
- What do you want?

466
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,818
Don't play innocent with me.

467
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:36,296
I know you want me to think it's the kid
that's somehow doing all this.

468
00:52:36,352 --> 00:52:41,131
- You know it is. You saw the tape.
- I don't know what I saw.

469
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:48,534
Evil's just another kind of life,
and like all life,

470
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:52,375
it doesn't come into
this world fully formed.

471
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:53,778
It's uh...

472
00:52:53,836 --> 00:52:58,842
it's like a seed, floating in the wind.

473
00:53:00,376 --> 00:53:03,516
That's where the Bible got it wrong.

474
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:10,495
I'm gonna skip, for the moment,
what you did to my husband or why.

475
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:15,400
But, believe me, I'll come
back to it and it won't be pretty.

476
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:23,506
Why do you keep your little boy
locked up in that shed?

477
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,009
Look, I know you're afraid
of your husband,

478
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:32,884
but whatever it is you think
that he can do to you,

479
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:37,084
is nothing compared with
25 years to life

480
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:41,424
in a prison full of homicidal mothers
who would love to carve you up

481
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:45,990
like a Christmas goose
for what you're doing to your own child.

482
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,537
You saw the signs.

483
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,806
Maybe if you hadn't been looking for
them, you wouldn't have noticed them.

484
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,738
But you saw them.

485
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,577
Just like you,
I had to be sure.

486
00:54:02,638 --> 00:54:05,676
I studied those images for weeks.

487
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,680
I don't know what I saw.

488
00:54:13,549 --> 00:54:16,530
it's growing inside of him.

489
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:22,999
Learning, developing.
Rapidly, like a child.

490
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,969
At first it started out
with just simple things

491
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:29,532
- like rattling the dishes

492
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,978
and fluttering little pieces of paper.

493
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:39,547
But then it moved on to other things.

494
00:54:46,749 --> 00:54:49,320
My husband is not a man of God.

495
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,994
He pretends to be, but he's not.

496
00:54:54,056 --> 00:54:57,060
He brought me over here to be his wife.

497
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:59,968
And to bear his child.

498
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:04,773
Wait... That's... That is his child?

499
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,507
Of course.

500
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:10,050
Why would he lock
his own child in that shed?

501
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,380
He didn't.

502
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,878
I did.

503
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:18,385
The children in Gatlin,

504
00:55:18,447 --> 00:55:24,295
they called it,
"He who walks behind the rows."

505
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:31,367
So it kills a cop
and it keeps us here hostage.

506
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:33,805
- For what?
- It wants your wife.

507
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:38,007
That means you're the expendable one.

508
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:42,777
Of course, all the men are expendable
once the seeds are sewn.

509
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:47,913
How do you even know any of this?

510
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,613
I see things.

511
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:55,024
It puts pictures in my head,
I don't know why.

512
00:55:55,084 --> 00:55:57,064
Like what?

513
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,261
Like your wife's abortion
after her first pregnancy.

514
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,737
- It was a miscarriage.
- That's what she says to you.

515
00:56:09,665 --> 00:56:12,236
I don't believe this. Any of it.

516
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:15,510
- She was unsure.
- Of what?

517
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,381
Of you.

518
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,889
I was trying to protect him
from my husband.

519
00:56:22,945 --> 00:56:24,856
I locked him in a shed.

520
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:27,653
I didn't know what else to do.

521
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:31,028
- Call the cops?
- You saw what he did to that policeman.

522
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,923
Your husband did that?

523
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:36,368
He will blame our son,
but it's not true.

524
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:40,273
Our son is innocent,
like all children.

525
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:43,273
The evil is in him.

526
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:49,509
You know, I can make the case
that you're behind all of this.

527
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,710
You could.

528
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,054
And that's the misery of it.

529
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,646
I have to go.

530
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,725
What does this thing want
with my wife?

531
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,062
What does it want?

532
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,525
It's a seed.

533
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:12,733
A seed that lives inside of other seeds.

534
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,934
It wants her baby.

535
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:21,714
Why?

536
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:27,016
It lives inside of children,
but children, they grow up.

537
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,556
They become adults.

538
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:33,822
And adults can become... unwilling.

539
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,630
To what?

540
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:38,888
To kill.

541
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:44,761
I provide it
with whatever it needs,

542
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:49,867
and what it needs the most are children.

543
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,875
Little lambs.

544
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:59,750
To replace those that
were sacrificed to adulthood.

545
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,586
Just tell me one thing.
How do we get out of this house?

546
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,024
When it's asleep.

547
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:09,928
Great. How do we know if it's asleep?

548
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:12,860
You won't.

549
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:17,166
You'll only know when it's
awake.

550
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:29,373
We don't even know what to watch for.

551
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,279
Everything.

552
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:35,549
- Don't lean against the door.
- Why?

553
00:58:35,611 --> 00:58:38,455
I don't know why, just don't do it!

554
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:40,652
All right.

555
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:58,340
When you had the miscarriage,
it was a miscarriage, right?

556
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:00,536
Not a...

557
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,645
Not what? Not what, Tim?

558
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,555
Nothing.

559
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:50,855
it's the delivery guy.

560
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:06,777
- Not yet, not yet. Wait.
- What?

561
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:53,552
Howdy.

562
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,759
Got everything there.

563
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,857
You're about a month early
on that acorn squash,

564
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,163
so I had to swap that out for zucchini.

565
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:05,103
You got your sweet corn,
that's nature's candy.

566
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,435
- What do you think?
- Shh!

567
01:01:06,495 --> 01:01:09,032
I got you two little hams
instead of the one big one,

568
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:12,102
- but it's about the same weight, so...
- Fine, fine.

569
01:01:14,603 --> 01:01:16,241
And what's this here?

570
01:01:16,772 --> 01:01:18,649
Well, that there is...

571
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:22,384
...something special
for one lucky little boy.

572
01:01:22,444 --> 01:01:25,823
No, no, I did not
order anything for any boy.

573
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:30,054
It was me.

574
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:48,041
I had something like that
when I was a little boy.

575
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:50,083
I run that thing into the ground.

576
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,088
Gonna need you to do us a favor.

577
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:59,889
We got a couple of young people
got stranded out here last night.

578
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:02,190
Yeah, I seen the car broke down.

579
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:06,591
Think you could give them a
lift into Burrelson's Garage?

580
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:11,101
Sure, yeah.
That's on my way and everything.

581
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:15,508
Here, let me help you
get this stuff inside, there.

582
01:02:15,564 --> 01:02:19,876
Oh, no, everything's fine,
just leave them right where they are.

583
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:22,680
Okey-dokey.

584
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:25,685
Well, y'all... Y'all keep a cool stool.

585
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:37,125
I see you got a visit
from the police, there.

586
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,662
None of my business.

587
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:49,039
Hey, tell your guests I gotta be
rolling in about five minutes.

588
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,441
Appreciate it.

589
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,179
I don't like this.

590
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:39,282
Hey, y'all, come on over. I don't bite.

591
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:45,029
Mr. Pritchett,
I'm Tim Gleason, this is my wife, Allie.

592
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:46,657
it's real nice to meet
you.

593
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:50,599
- I appreciate you helping us out.
- You know what?

594
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:54,206
I know what it's like
to get stuck out in the boonies.

595
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:57,210
I've been stuck out here,
like, 33 years.

596
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:05,816
- Here you go.
- You got room up there for both of us?

597
01:04:05,874 --> 01:04:08,582
No, I just... I barely got room for one,

598
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,954
you're gonna have to
ride in the back, there.

599
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:13,459
I'll get you to Burrelson's
as quick as I can.

600
01:04:13,515 --> 01:04:16,086
You know, before it gets too heated-up.

601
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:20,697
I got some blankets and stuff in here
if it'd make you more comfortable.

602
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:34,574
Let's go.

603
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:42,854
OK, come on, let's go.

604
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:48,124
- What's wrong?
- He left the lights on.

605
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:51,430
Come on, come on, come on.

606
01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:00,101
It's a more comfortable ride,
I'll give you that, but...

607
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:07,277
...I wouldn't recommend
stealing, or borrowing, a police car.

608
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,976
Please. Please.
Please, please, please.

609
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:17,279
Come on.

610
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:22,721
Go, go, go, go, go!

611
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:42,542
Hell, I... I reckon that takes care
of our little police problem.

612
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,886
oh, God.

613
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,526
Yes.

614
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,806
I brought you something.

615
01:06:19,174 --> 01:06:20,915
I hope you like it.

616
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,091
Please don't be angry with me.

617
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,162
I will take you away from all of this.

618
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,192
I promise.

619
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,498
Soon, very soon.

620
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,873
Mommy loves you.

621
01:06:51,306 --> 01:06:53,479
Mommy will always love you.

622
01:06:56,845 --> 01:06:58,825
No matter what.

623
01:07:07,956 --> 01:07:10,095
What really happened back there?

624
01:07:10,158 --> 01:07:12,764
I mean, taking away
all the he said, she said?

625
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:14,273
It was some kind of a cult.

626
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:17,708
And that kid, if he's even a kid at all,
is at the center of it.

627
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:24,578
What if he's just an innocent child?

628
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,712
Then he'll be taken away from those
freaks and given to a good home.

629
01:07:55,637 --> 01:07:57,639
One thing seems pretty clear.

630
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:02,844
Whoever, or whatever did all that,
was playing with our perceptions,

631
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:04,754
- getting inside our heads.
- Yeah.

632
01:08:04,813 --> 01:08:06,224
So, I have to admit

633
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:09,592
it's got me wondering now
just what was real back there

634
01:08:09,651 --> 01:08:11,722
and what wasn't.

635
01:08:13,922 --> 01:08:16,926
Including what really went on
between you and Helen.

636
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:20,963
Come on, when Preacher said
what he said, he was baiting me.

637
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:23,805
He knows his wife,
he knows what she's capable of.

638
01:08:23,865 --> 01:08:25,208
He doesn't know me.

639
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:34,648
OK. You're forgiven.

640
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:39,056
- Forgiven? I didn't do anything!
- Forgiven just in case you did.

641
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,318
I think I can live with that.

642
01:09:05,507 --> 01:09:07,077
Honey, I don't like
the looks of that.

643
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:09,383
Yeah, that top one
seems loose, doesn't it?

644
01:09:09,444 --> 01:09:11,515
Yeah, speed up and go around it.

645
01:09:13,348 --> 01:09:16,192
Wait, no. Just slow down
and let it get ahead of you.

646
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:18,731
- Make up your mind.
- Slower.

647
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,532
Wait, never mind. You know,
it looks like it's gonna hold.

648
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,866
- For Chrissakes, Allie!
- I'm sorry, I don't like it!

649
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:25,427
Just go around it!

650
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,901
What are you doing?

651
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:35,414
You wanted me to go around it,
I'm making sure it gets out of the way.

652
01:09:41,543 --> 01:09:43,216
Oh, my God, Tim, look out!

653
01:09:43,378 --> 01:09:44,880
- Oh, my God!
- Ahh!

654
01:09:48,116 --> 01:09:50,619
- Oh, my God!
- Hold on.

655
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,029
Come on!

656
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:55,661
Be careful! Oh, my God!

657
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:58,302
- Ahhh!
- Watch out!

658
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:03,633
- What is going on?
- Tim, I love you.

659
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:52,514
Tim.

660
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:54,850
Tim?

661
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:03,992
No...

662
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:06,831
No...

663
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,148
Poor thing.

664
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,355
Got yourself in
quite a pickle here, don't you?

665
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,624
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'll get you fixed up good as new.

666
01:11:33,955 --> 01:11:35,798
I'm sorry about your hubby.

667
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:40,429
Looks like he's in
the arms of Jesus now.

668
01:12:43,491 --> 01:12:44,902
Here we go.

669
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:47,195
Come on.

670
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:08,784
There she is.

671
01:13:10,418 --> 01:13:12,420
Little worse for the wear, but...

672
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:15,028
...she's still pretty as a peach.

673
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:20,569
I don't know how you do it. Each one
of them's sweeter than the last.

674
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:23,667
Whoever receives
the child...

675
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,473
Do not despise the
little ones, for they are...

676
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:29,003
Blessed children do not
follow the rules of their fathers...

677
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,547
And a child shall lead them.
