6
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:36,621
Babe? Fire's starting
to go down.

7
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,957
Would you please go get
some more firewood?

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,584
Come on. I'm tired.

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,130
Come on. Please?
It's starting to get cold. Aw.

10
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:47,757
I'm getting cold. Oh, hey!
 Come on.

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,430
Hey,just remember I have the keys,
and I'll leave without ya.

12
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:56,433
Hey, okay. All right.
I'll get some wood.

13
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:58,518
Yeah, I'll get some.
Great.

14
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:30,550
Mmm. Thanks for bringing back
the wood, babe.

15
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:26,512
<i>JJ'</i>

16
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,819
<i>jj'</i>

17
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:47,867
You know, this last guy
wanted the ultimate.

18
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,370
You should have seen what his
idea of “the ultimate” was.

19
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:55,041
I mean, I thought
I've seen them all,

20
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:59,587
but this guy had something
that was a new one even on me.

21
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,964
<i>Oh.</i>

22
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:05,510
So, um, how you doin' tonight, kid?
You look a little down.

23
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,223
I need one more trick
to make my rent.

24
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:12,683
Hmm. I know how that is.

25
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,852
Oh, here's somebody.

26
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,980
<i>Hey.</i>

27
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,066
You wanna go out?

28
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:26,697
How much?
Twenty-five's regular.

29
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,908
Fifty's French and regular.

30
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:36,040
For 75, I'll take you
around the world.

31
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,252
Hey, uh, don't forget
“the ultimate.” Yeah.

32
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:40,920
How much is that?

33
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:44,590
For a hundred bucks,
I'll give you the ultimate, baby.

34
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,926
Let's go.
You're on.

35
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,053
See you later.
All right.

36
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,149
<i>A L it is' cold outside.</i>

37
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,151
<i>Get lost, deadbeat!</i>

38
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,361
<i>It's cold outside, Al!
So? Bundle up.</i>

39
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,325
<i>People who don't pay their bills, they
take it on the arches. Shove it!</i>

40
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:13,786
Get lost.

41
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,080
Yes, can I help you?

42
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,500
Give me my favorite room, AI.
You got it.

43
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,090
Okay, that's 25 for the room.

44
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:35,892
If you'd like a color TV, Mr. Packard,
another five bucks.

45
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,647
And 35 with the tax.

46
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:43,482
All right.

47
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,403
Okay.

48
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,575
You joining us
for continental breakfast?

49
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,538
What can I do for you, sweetheart?
How corny, AI.

50
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:20,519
Put the money on the dresser,
sweetie,

51
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,939
<i>and I'll catch up with you.</i>

52
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,987
You ever model?

53
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,534
Yeah, sure.

54
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:40,039
Show me.

55
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,670
Like what?

56
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,006
Like in the magazines.

57
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,226
Like this?

58
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,437
Yeah.

59
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,489
Or like this?

60
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,744
Yeah.

61
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,755
Like this?

62
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,507
Mm-hmm.

63
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,639
Like this?

64
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:40,933
Hot stuff.

65
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:45,646
Come on, honey.
The meter's tickin'.

66
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,983
I got money.

67
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,068
Lots of money.

68
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,781
Want me to model for you
some more?

69
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,118
No.

70
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,314
Leave your clothes on.

71
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,027
Okay.

72
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,032
Anything you want.
I want you to have a good time.

73
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,359
I can%.

74
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,701
Relax.

75
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:28,791
There's more than one way
to skin a cat.

76
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,043
Right?

77
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,171
Right. Right.

78
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,140
Uh!

79
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,642
You like that, honey?
No.

80
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,562
I love it.

81
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,324
[1

82
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,076
Uh!

83
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,496
Oh, you're so good.

84
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,959
You know, I like this
with my clothes on.

85
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,211
Yeah.

86
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,840
You're good!

87
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,884
Ooh!

88
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:22,011
Yeah. Hey-

89
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,346
You bitch!
What-

90
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,433
What are you doing?

91
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,730
Stop it!
What are you doing?

92
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,776
Stop it!

93
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,823
Stop it! Aah!

94
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,746
Please, baby!

95
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,630
Stop it!

96
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:02,218
Stop it!

97
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,194
Help!

98
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:44,593
<i>jj</i>

99
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,616
Why didn't you stop me?

100
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:19,003
Mommy. I didn't wanna do it.

101
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,090
I didn't wanna do it.

102
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,884
Mommy. I didn't wanna do it.

103
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,355
Why'd you make me do that?

104
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,692
I didn't wanna do it.

105
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,033
I didn't wanna do that.

106
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,161
Christmas shopping, Mr. Zito?

107
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:17,913
Yes, Terry.

108
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,537
Miss me?

109
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,845
You're gonna like it here.

110
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:34,198
Oh,yes.

111
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:44,208
I told you not to go out tonight,
didn't I?

112
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,836
Every time you go out,
this kind of thing happens.

113
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,299
This has got to stop. it's silly.

114
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:55,677
And it's not getting us anywhere

115
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:59,139
You think they don't know?
They do.

116
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:02,476
I heard it, and I know.

117
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,853
They all know,

118
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:08,607
and I don't like it any more.

119
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,568
But you don't listen, do you?

120
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,571
It's got to stop.

121
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,782
You'll like it here.

122
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:19,910
Oh, you're right about them.
All of them.

123
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,995
They're all the same.

124
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,581
I know what they're like.

125
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,876
Just because I can't do
the things you do...

126
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,631
doesn't mean I don't see it
all the same.

127
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,510
Fancy-schmancy.

128
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,513
And what are we supposed to do?

129
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,559
Sit and smile and, “Yes, miss,”
“No, miss,” “Not now, miss”?

130
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,644
“Whatever you say, miss”?

131
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:49,356
I know. I know how it is with their airs
and their looks and their-

132
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:52,901
They can drive a man crazy!

133
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,779
I di- I didn't mean that.

134
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,991
I didn't mean it that way.

135
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,743
It's just that they-

136
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,246
they don't know when to stop.

137
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,249
They never know when to stop.

138
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:10,127
That's why they have to be stopped.

139
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,715
It is. You're right. You're right.
But not like that.

140
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,009
Not that way.

141
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,011
Please.

142
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,347
They'll take you away from me.

143
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,349
You have to be careful.

144
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,894
You have to listen to me.

145
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,897
We can't live like this.

146
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,107
I have to go out.

147
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,611
And each time, it's like this.

148
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:38,614
I get so scared
that they'll take you away.

149
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,784
But they won't...

150
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,870
if you do what I say.

151
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,873
They won't take you away.
Not ever.

152
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:51,376
Not ever, I swear.
Not ever.

153
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:20,799
Polly want a cracker?
Hmm? Hmm?

154
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,780
I'll be right back.

155
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,736

156
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,738
Hello.

157

ls your, uh- ls your boyfriend
waiting for you tonight?

158
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,743
Are you kidding?
Of course.

159
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,745
He's gonna have
a long wait.

160
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,747
<i>Why do you say that?</i>

161
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,734
Um-

162
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,614
Well, here we are, huh?

163
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:34,367
My boyfriend's gonna kill me
if I don't get home soon.

164
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,497
Your boyfriend isn't here.

165
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,876
This is really a nice place, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah.

166
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,546
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,403
Do you come here a lot?

168
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,489
Mm-hmm.

169
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,784
Oh.
Hmm.

170
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:45,230
You wanna meet me someplace?
Where?

171
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,234
The back seat.

172
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,654
Sure.

173
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,768
- You're great.
- You are.

174
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:28,500
I see something.

175
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,335
It's your boyfriend.
No! Let's get outta here.

176
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:33,380
There's somebody out there.
There's somebody over there!

177
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:36,216
I see somebody over there!
There's nobody there. There's nobody there!

178
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,219
Let's get my jacket.
I wanna go. I wanna go home!

179
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:42,639
Come on, let's go.
There's somebody there. I know.

180
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,437
Come on! Go!

181
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:53,441
There's somebody out there.
Come on, let's go. Start the car!

182
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,319
Come on!
Start the car!

183
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:00,532
Come on, let's go.
Start the car. Start the car!

184
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:02,700
<i>Get outta here!</i>

185
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,677
<i>...what
happened at the governor's mansion in Albany yesterday</i>

186
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:48,139
<i>This is George Garrison
from On The Spot News.</i>

187
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,600
<i>Right now, we are live
over midtown Manhattan.</i>

188
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:55,063
<i>bringing you the latest update on one of the most
violent killing sprees in our city's history.</i>

189
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:59,067
Following yesterday's brutal slaying of a
young couple under the Verrazano Bridge,

190
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,863
New York City Police Commissioner Paul Delaney
has assigned a special task force...

191
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:09,911
<i>of over two dozen detectives to join in on the manhunt for
a madman who has left five dead in the metropolitan area.</i>

192
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:12,539
<i>The peculiar yet brutal
disfigurement of the bodies...</i>

193
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:16,751
<i>has led police to believe that one man
is responsible for the killings.</i>

194
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:20,338
<i>50 ﬂair, witnesses are few,
and detectives are stumped for clues.</i>

195
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:23,341
<i>Back in local politics,
Assemblyman Anthony Ventura-</i>

196
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,280
You tell me what I should do.

197
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,658
I heard about it.

198
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,410
I always do.

199
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,122
I can't go out for a minute.

200
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:57,709
it's impossible.

201
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,845
Fancy girls...

202
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,931
and their fancy dresses
and their lipstick...

203
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:16,519
laughing and dancing.

204
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,606
But you stop them, don't you?

205
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,233
I can't stop 'em.

206
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,527
But you do, don't you?

207
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,330
Then they can't laugh,
and they can't dance any more.

208
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,417
So you got to stop,

209
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,337
or they'll take you away from me.

210
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,640
I won't ever...

211
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,729
let them take you away from me.

212
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,154
You're mine now forever-

213
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:15,286
and I'm so happy.

214
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,745
And, uh, I got on TV.

215
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,750
Denise, be careful.

216
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:05,378
<i>Don't swing so high.
Okay I won't.</i>

217
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,630
All of my friends
were so surprised.

218
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,134
Denise,
you wanna ride our bikes?

219
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,594
My mother said
I can't leave the park.

220
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:16,347
Oh, come on.
Come on.

221
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,057
Okay.

222
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:43,916
Be careful, little girl.

223
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:13,357
Pat, are you sure Jerry and I
can't give you a ride home?

224
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:16,360
Oh, no, thanks, Kath.
Ken'll be here in a second.

225
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:19,363
And if not,
I'll splurge and take a taxi.

226
00:37:19,447 --> 00:37:22,366
Well, here's the newspaper, if you
wanna read it while you're waiting.

227
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,369
Are you sure you don't need it?
I wanna check my horoscope.

228
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:28,372
No, I already read it
this afternoon on my break.

229
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:33,586
Oh, I hate reading the newspapers these days
with that kook running around. Yuck.

230
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:38,215
I know. That guy's really a sicko.
I hope they catch him soon.

231
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:42,637
Yeah- Oh, be sure and check Mr. Gannon's I.V.
on your shift tomorrow.

232
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,473
He, uh, pulled it out
again tonight.

233
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:47,558
Not again.
He's too much!

234
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,936
I will. I'm so cold.

235
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,896
Here's Jerry.
Okay.

236
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:57,360
- You sure I can't give you a lift?
- No, thanks.

237
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,487
Okay.
See you tomorrow.

238
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,863
Night!

239
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,743
Hi.

240
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,013
Open!

241
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:16,392
Open up!

242
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:08,694
Oh! Oh!

243
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:26,011
This is what you like, baby,
isn't it?

244
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,763
This is what you like, isn't it?

245
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:29,389
Yeah, this is what you like.

246
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:33,018
It's nice, isn't it?

247
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:57,543
<i>Now, now, now. It'll be all right.</i>

248
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:01,630
<i>Look, it's just a little inconvenient.</i>

249
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,216
<i>I know how upsetting it is.</i>

250
00:48:05,384 --> 00:48:08,470
<i>But it's just a little blood.</i>

251
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:10,556
<i>It'll wash out.</i>

252
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:14,434
<i>Look, you have to be more careful.</i>

253
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:16,853
<i>Yes.</i>

254
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,855
Huh.

255
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:27,614
You're getting very careless-
blood in your hair.

256
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:29,408
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

257
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:31,535
What will people say?

258
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,789
What will we do?

259
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,917
You want to look pretty, don't you?

260
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:40,919
Pretty for me?

261
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:52,556
You're so pretty.

262
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:01,064
J';

263
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:09,448
J';

264
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,875
<i>Oh.</i>

265
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:31,803
<i>Hold on. I'm coming.</i>

266
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:37,851
<i>Who is it?
Yes, uh, my name is Frank Zito.</i>

267
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:40,937
<i>You took my picture in the park.
May I speak with you?</i>

268
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:43,815
Come in.

269
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:45,984
That's- That's amazing.

270
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:48,362
I was just looking at a photo
I took of you in the park.

271
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:52,324
Really? Well, uh, it's a coincidence, because
what I wanted to, uh, speak to you about-

272
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:54,951
Do you mind if I take a look?
Certainly.

273
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:07,130
<i>Oh, great.</i>

274
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:09,174
Here you are.
Thanks.

275
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:11,885
Listen, um-

276
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,471
Listen, how come
all your models are women?

277
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,808
Well, it's just something
I'm interested in as a woman.

278
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:22,020
In fact, this is my fourth series.
It's called Woman Four.

279
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,189
Mm-hmm.
Not very original, is it?

280
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:26,358
Well, it's not the title
that matters that much.

281
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,527
No. No.

282
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,821
Listen, do you get to, uh,
keep them all?

283
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:32,614
I'm hoping to sell them.

284
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:36,410
I wouldn't. I-I'd keep 'em forever.

285
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:38,412
But Why?

286
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:41,456
I mean, part of my profession
is to sell photographs.

287
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,418
It's not all for art's sake, you know.

288
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:47,963
I know, but why do you take pictures
of women this way?

289
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,217
I like to make them look beautiful.

290
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,261
No. I think it's more
to preserve them.

291
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,847
You see, the beauty
is already in the model.

292
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,099
Frank, don't be silly.

293
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:01,685
Listen, I'm the photographer, right?
Right.

294
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:04,771
So I should know
what I'm doing, shouldn't I?

295
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:09,192
I know, but to me, you know,
things change, people die.

296
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:12,529
But in a painting or a picture,
they're yours forever.

297
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,200
There's no way you can
possess someone forever,

298
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:19,286
even in a photograph.

299
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:21,079
There's no way.

300
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:25,584
Well, I was noticing this picture
of this old lady here.

301
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:29,546
At one point in her life,
she was someone's sister,

302
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,132
someone's wife, someone's mother.

303
00:51:32,215 --> 00:51:35,343
And when the photographer took her picture,
he had her the way he wanted her.

304
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:37,387
She could never leave him.

305
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,600
She couldn't grow old,
and she couldn't die.

306
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:43,852
Tell me, Frank.
What do you do for a living?

307
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,396
Um, I'm a painter.
Yeah?

308
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,816
Abstracts, some still lifes, some landscapes.
You know, things like that.

309
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,527
I'd love to see some of your work
sometime.

310
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:54,446
You would?
I'd love to, yes.

311
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,657
Listen, uh, Anna,

312
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,659
I know this place over
in New Jersey, you know?

313
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:02,078
Yeah?
Clams Casino.

314
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:03,955
Italian food.
Mm-hmm.

315
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,540
And, uh-

316
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:07,709
Would you like to have dinner?

317
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:09,878
Why, Frank,
are you asking me for a date?

318
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:13,965
<i>You talkin' to me?
I'm talking to you.</i>

319
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:16,134
I'd love to, yes.
I really would.

320
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:19,095
- Give me five minutes, and I'll be right with you.
- Great.

321
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,410
<i>jj</i>

322
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:48,416
jj,<i> </i> You're the
most beautiful woman I've seen since, uh, my mom.

323
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:52,295
Thank you.
You're welcome.

324
00:52:54,464 --> 00:52:55,882
Thanks.

325
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:58,385
Have you got a picture of her?
Yeah.

326
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:04,891
Mmm.

327
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:07,644
Here. it's when she was younger.
Oh, right.

328
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:11,523
Tell me, where does she live?

329
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:14,860
Oh, we lived in Queens, but, uh,
my mother was taken from me...

330
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:17,737
in an automobile accident
when I was younger.

331
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:19,531
I'm sorry.

332
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:22,117
She really was lovely.
Mm-hmm.

333
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,202
Mmm, it's a shame.

334
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:27,873
Listen, Frank.
What?

335
00:53:27,956 --> 00:53:30,458
Rita's coming to the loft
tonight at 9:00,

336
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:32,586
and I want to get
all the work finished.

337
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:35,672
So she promised me
she'd work overtime.

338
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:38,800
So, in other words, it's an early night.
Is that it?

339
00:53:38,884 --> 00:53:40,927
It is really.

340
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:43,179
Well, as long as I can
see you again, I mean-

341
00:53:43,305 --> 00:53:45,223
Yes, of course.
Great.

342
00:53:45,307 --> 00:53:47,601
What about tomorrow night?

343
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:50,020
Tomorrow night?
Let's see if I'm booked.

344
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:52,022
No, of course tomorrow night
would be great.

345
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:56,276
But I know you're very busy, and I'm
sure that, uh, something will come up.

346
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,695
I might be and, then again,
I might not be.

347
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:04,367
Oh, but I'll definitely see you
on Thursday at the show.

348
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:06,202
No kidding.
You'll be there.

349
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:08,330
Yes, and so will
five million other guys.

350
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:11,249
Oh, Frank.
What?

351
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:13,335
Are you annoyed?
No.

352
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:16,046
I mean, that would be ridiculous,
wouldn't it?

353
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:17,631
Yes, it would.

354
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:21,801
Mr. Steiner's doing this-
He's having this really big celebration.

355
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:24,596
He's asked all these people
from Art <i>World</i> down,

356
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:28,433
and it- it could be something
really special for me.

357
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:31,394
I understand.
I wish you the best of luck, Anna.

358
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:34,522
I know you do. Yeah.

359
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:39,110
L- I just hope
you really do understand.

360
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:43,239
Do I have a choice?
Mmm.

361
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:45,325
No. Not really.
No.

362
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:47,202

I was scared.
Real scared.

471

I hid in the closet.
Did you know that?

No, you didn't know that.

that you wouldn't come back.

01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:33,616
You did come back.
I found you.

478
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:36,744
I knew I would.

479
01:06:41,082 --> 01:06:44,960
And now you're mine,
all mine.

480
01:06:47,213 --> 01:06:50,716
Why did you need those other men?
They didn't love you.

481
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,805
I did. I loved you.
I needed you.

482
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:58,391
There were so many men.

483
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:08,109
I never wanted to hurt you.

484
01:07:21,122 --> 01:07:24,542
I never wanted to hurt you.

485
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,836
Never.

486
01:07:28,504 --> 01:07:30,339
But there were so many men.

487
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:36,679
There was- So many men.

488
01:07:39,682 --> 01:07:42,435
Why?

489
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:44,687
Because they gave you some dollars?

490
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,901
But they didn't love you.

491
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:53,529
I loved you.

492
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,032
Only me.

493
01:07:57,116 --> 01:08:00,119
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

494
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:03,831
Frank, don't kill me.

495
01:08:03,956 --> 01:08:07,793
No. No.

496
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:10,045
I'm not going to kill you.

497
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,632
I'm going to keep you...

498
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:18,179
so you'll never go away.

499
01:08:35,738 --> 01:08:38,866
I'm just going to keep you...

500
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:42,161
so you won't go away
ever again.

501
01:08:56,258 --> 01:08:58,552
Mommy.

502
01:08:58,636 --> 01:09:01,472
Oh, Mommy.

503
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:05,267
Mommy.

504
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:09,230
Oh, Mommy.

505
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:12,817
Oh, Mommy!

506
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,819
Mommy.

507
01:09:17,613 --> 01:09:19,532
Not tonight.

508
01:09:23,244 --> 01:09:25,663
You ain't goin' out tonight.

509
01:09:28,457 --> 01:09:32,336
Tonight, you stay home...
with me.

510
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:34,106
You know, when Mommy tells you to...
hide in the closet,

511
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:37,693
you have to do what Mommy tells you...

512
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,905
or else you know what happens.

513
01:11:35,918 --> 01:11:40,130
J',P

514
01:12:32,307 --> 01:12:34,810
J';

515
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:56,707
- Hello.
- Hello, Anna. This is Frank.

516
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,917
I was wondering if you'd like
to take in a show tonight.

517
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:01,378
Sounds like a good idea, Frank.

518
01:13:01,462 --> 01:13:03,881
Could you be ready
in about 15 minutes, say?

519
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:05,966
- I can be ready in 10.
- Okay, I'll see you.

520
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,052
Okay. Bye.

521
01:13:58,644 --> 01:14:01,146
What's that for?

522
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:03,357
Oh, it's just to thank you.

523
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,487
Thank you for sending the-
the ﬂowers for the funeral parlor and-

524
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,823
and for attending the funeral.

525
01:14:10,906 --> 01:14:15,160
Rita didn't have many friends,
and I really appreciated it.

526
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:17,246
It's okay.

527
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:20,082
Look, I was wondering if we could
stop by the cemetery.

528
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:22,251
I want to pay my respects
to my mother.

529
01:14:22,334 --> 01:14:26,672
I usually drop off a wreath- I have it
in the back seat- at Christmas time.

530
01:14:26,755 --> 01:14:28,674
Would that be all right,
before we go to dinner?

531
01:14:28,799 --> 01:14:30,467
Of course.
Fabulous.

532
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:32,928
Mmm.
Thanks

533
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:00,789
Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost.
Amen.

534
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,626
Hail Many, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

535
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:07,129
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

536
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:10,549
Hail Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death. Amen

537
01:15:12,718 --> 01:15:14,428
Hail Many, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

538
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:19,057
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy-

539
01:15:19,141 --> 01:15:23,020
<i>- </i> Oh, my head
<i>- </i> Frank.

540
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:24,980
Oh, my head hurts.
Frank, what's the matter?

541
01:15:25,105 --> 01:15:27,065
What's the matter?
It hurts.

542
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:29,443
My head hurts.
Don't. Please.

543
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:32,654
It was a long time ago, Frank.
Rita knew.

544
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:35,824
What do you mean?

545
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:37,868
Rita knew.
What do you mean?

546
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:41,830
She's mine forever.
What are you talking about, Frank?

547
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:44,208
Rita knew! Rita knew!
Frank!
