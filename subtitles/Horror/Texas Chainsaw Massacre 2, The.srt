1
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,726
They're trying to kill me.
They are crazy.

2
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:34,647
Just calm down, Sally. You're safe now.

3
00:00:35,397 --> 00:00:36,597
Can you tell me what happened?

4
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:38,359
We ran out of gas.

5
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:40,361
Kirk went for help.

6
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:43,364
Hello?

7
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:45,449
Hello?

8
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,911
Anybody home?

9
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:03,425
Kirk.

10
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:26,490
Kirk?

11
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:42,809
Jerry.

12
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,469
Jerry.

13
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:50,556
Sally, I hear something. Stop. Stop.

14
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:10,034
No. Please. Please.

15
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:12,620
Please. Please stop.

16
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,959
Give me that hammer.

17
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:55,342
Sheriff, we have got
the victim's statement.

18
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,206
She's en route to the hospital.

19
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:58,332
What's your 20?

20
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,668
On Quick Hill Road.
Headed out there now.

21
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,545
Call for an ambulance,
in case there's any others still alive.

22
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:05,589
Hey, Sheriff. This is Marvin.

23
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:07,925
I am only 2 minutes
behind you and I am closing.

24
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:09,611
All right, step on it, Marvin.

25
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:12,805
Sheriff, that family is likely armed.

26
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:14,640
You going to wait for backup?

27
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,309
I can't wait. I am going in now.

28
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:26,172
- I swear to God.
- Come on, let's go.

29
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:27,486
Shit.

30
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:39,832
Sheriff wants
an ambulance to 647 Quick Hill Road.

31
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:40,958
You copy?

32
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:49,049
Drayton?

33
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,176
You know why I am here.

34
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:52,678
Come out and bring your son, Jed.

35
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:54,763
Hands high above your heads.

36
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:59,268
I ain't leaving, Drayton.

37
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:02,980
I have a girl
says you butchered her friends.

38
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:05,858
No one's turning a blind eye to this.

39
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,824
He's protecting the house and the family.

40
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:15,547
Yeah, well that ain't the way I heard it.

41
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:31,133
Oh, damn it. Come on out here.

42
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,886
Look, I ain't waiting out here all day.

43
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:36,138
I will call in the Staties,
if that's what you want.

44
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:38,932
Send the boy out, Drayton.

45
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:42,269
Look, this don't have to get
no uglier than it already is.

46
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,998
Fuckers ain't getting anybody in this
family. You don't want to make it worse.

47
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:47,357
I ain't leaving without the boy, Drayton.

48
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:48,567
We're Sawyers.

49
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,068
- Hell, yeah.
- What's it going to be?

50
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,945
You do what you have to do, Sheriff.

51
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:53,113
Send the boy out.

52
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:59,661
Give him the boy. He's simple anyway.

53
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:01,580
He's family.

54
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:24,645
We're going to send out Jed.

55
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,856
All right. Send him.

56
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:29,983
Hold it up, Marvin.

57
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:32,528
And he gets a good lawyer.

58
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:34,404
Agreed.

59
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,115
You did it now, boy.

60
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:39,604
You let that bitch meat get away.

61
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:46,375
Oh, shit.

62
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:54,424
- Come on out, Sawyer.
- Give us that retard.

63
00:05:57,678 --> 00:05:59,555
There's more. Them ain't cops.

64
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:02,558
Get back here, Drayton.

65
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:04,518
We got trouble.

66
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,900
All right, just stay back now, Burt.
I got this.

67
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,776
- We're here to back you up.
- Yeah, you can start....

68
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:15,237
...by getting everybody back in their
cars and high-tailing it out of here.

69
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:16,604
Yeah, that ain't going to happen.

70
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:19,199
Let's go, boys.
Lynch these son of a bitches.

71
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:20,408
I have got control of this.

72
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:21,730
He's bringing the boy out, okay?

73
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:23,912
What are we doing there, Sheriff?

74
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:25,122
Kick his ass out.

75
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,727
Look, he's bringing his son out here.

76
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,250
Bring him out.

77
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,794
- Light them up, Ollie.
- Special delivery.

78
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,213
- No.
- Motherfuckers.

79
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:27,643
Hell, yeah. Sawyer bonfire.

80
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,103
This is on you, Burt.

81
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:35,108
Eye for an eye, Sheriff.
Can't get around the Good Book.

82
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,364
Hell of a job, boys.

83
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:42,074
Whoo.

84
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,548
Keep looking. When they're charred,
they're hard to find.

85
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:02,427
Ah, hell. Hey, Burt.

86
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:06,181
- Yeah?
- Looky here.

87
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:09,601
I am hanging this bad boy over the bar.

88
00:08:11,353 --> 00:08:13,554
- This baby's coming home with me.
- We going to be heroes.

89
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:31,790
Son of a bitch.

90
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:33,750
Help us.

91
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,879
Yeah. Yeah. Come here.

92
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:40,632
Come on. Come here. Come on.

93
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:42,551
Come on. Let her go. Let her go.

94
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:45,887
Come on. Yeah. Yeah.

95
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:48,890
I got her. Everything's okay.

96
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,937
Shh. Shh.

97
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:55,897
It's okay.

98
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,160
Hey, Gavin, where have you been?
What is...

99
00:09:08,744 --> 00:09:10,078
Oh, my God. It's a baby.

100
00:09:10,078 --> 00:09:12,164
Found her.
Brought her out through the woods.

101
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:15,751
Gavin. Come on, man,
we're going to be in the paper.

102
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,294
Yeah, man, I will be right there.

103
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:18,962
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:09:19,212 --> 00:09:20,172
Come on now, you're going to miss it.

105
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:21,415
- Gavin...
- Come on.

106
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:23,258
She's been burned.

107
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:25,302
Okay. Yeah, yeah, brother.

108
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:27,012
Be right there, my man.

109
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:28,305
We're going to keep her, right?

110
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:29,470
I got her for you, Arlene.

111
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,100
You never know how you look
till you get that picture took.

112
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:10,639
I will be right back.

113
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,395
Come on, what were you thinking?

114
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,940
Hey. He was Ryan's idea. I warned you.

115
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:22,234
Well, next time your raunchy-ass boyfriend

116
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:25,153
tries to stick me with one of his
high school band buddies,

117
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:28,657
kiss him for me. What?

118
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:30,992
I like him. He was pretty cool.

119
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:34,663
We started talking
and he made these incredible crepes.

120
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,164
Amazing.

121
00:10:36,373 --> 00:10:38,083
He's got this thing about becoming a chef.

122
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,378
And there's actually a lot more to him
than meets the eye.

123
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:44,464
So, do you think you can handle this
4-day road trip with him to New Orleans?

124
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:47,342
I am way ahead of you, girl.
He even volunteered to drive.

125
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:49,803
- Seriously? Wow.
- Hell, yeah.

126
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:51,805
- I was talking to...
- Hey, Nikki.

127
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,575
Bobby wants you back at your register.

128
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:57,352
All right. I am going to go work
on my Halloween costume.

129
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,104
And I don't mean scary.

130
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:27,132
Nikki digs your old high school friend.

131
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:30,135
- Something about crepes?
- That's Kenny's signature move.

132
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:32,220
Nikki had no chance.

133
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:38,052
I thought we weren't going to
bring our work home with us.

134
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,145
You think I am cracked?

135
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:44,566
No. But you might want to
broaden your extracurriculars.

136
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:48,392
Get over here and tear this up.

137
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,405
I am not up for a bruising.

138
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:52,407
I wasn't talking about the bag.

139
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:54,743
Neither was I.

140
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:10,592
I love your crazy little birthmark.

141
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,473
Fuck.

142
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:18,767
Who is that?

143
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:22,520
Shit. That, it might be my contract.

144
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:28,568
I am coming.

145
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:46,962
- It's for you.
- Me?

146
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:49,547
Some law office in Dallas, yeah.

147
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:56,721
My grandmother died 3 weeks ago.

148
00:12:57,764 --> 00:12:59,444
I thought all your grandparents were dead.

149
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:00,558
So did I.

150
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:03,937
I just wanted to have a child.

151
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:05,021
Enough. I wanted to have a child so...
Enough.

152
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,481
Enough. I wanted to have a child so...
Enough.

153
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,150
...bad and I couldn't.
Enough, Arlene. Enough.

154
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,861
Why couldn't you tell me?

155
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:13,363
Tell you what?

156
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:14,948
Your mother has a defective uterus?

157
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:18,451
She wanted a kid. End of story.

158
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,705
So what?
We're not good enough for you now?

159
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:22,914
I didn't say that.

160
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:27,085
I just want to know where
I came from and who I came from.

161
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:29,337
Well, we're the ones that raised you.

162
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,673
And you were damn lucky, I'd say.

163
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:33,341
Those people were...

164
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:35,580
I can't even put that into words.

165
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,761
- There are no words...
- Shut up, Arlene.

166
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,430
...for that, Heather. Shut up.

167
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:44,144
You came from a shit heap.

168
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,231
There. Now you know.

169
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,984
If I'd had half a mind,
I'd have left you there.

170
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:57,574
I am out. I am done.

171
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:58,783
Don't even think about going down there.

172
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:00,327
Heather.

173
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,496
Heather.

174
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:08,126
Heather. You go down there
you're going to bring trouble on us.

175
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:09,502
What are you talking about?

176
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:12,130
Trust me.

177
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:15,842
Newt, Texas is the
last place you want to be.

178
00:14:36,738 --> 00:14:38,615
- How'd it go?
- Like shit.

179
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:40,658
It sucks when you find out

180
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,786
your parents have been
lying to you your whole life.

181
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:44,245
Baby, I am sorry.

182
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:45,538
I was adopted.

183
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,086
I never felt right about them.

184
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:54,756
I am going to go pack.

185
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:56,758
- For Texas, not New Orleans.
- Wait.

186
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:58,593
- Hold on.
- No, Ryan. I have to go.

187
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:00,762
- Forget Halloween.
- Wait. Wait, just listen to me, please.

188
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,971
Hey.

189
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,685
Oh. Ryan called us.

190
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:10,438
- Kenny.
- That's really cool art.

191
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:14,734
See, I kind of figured you'd want to
deal with your grandmother's stuff so...

192
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:18,530
So, knowing how hard-headed you are,
we have decided to come with you.

193
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:20,907
Really? You guys would do that?

194
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:22,158
Are you kidding me?

195
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:26,955
Come here. Of course.
Come on. You're our girl.

196
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:31,084
Listen, I wasn't going to send you
to some cousin-fuck town all alone.

197
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:33,336
I don't mind driving to Texas.

198
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:34,796
I hear they got great barbecue.

199
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:38,425
So, maybe so, maybe no?

200
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:40,760
All right. Sounds like a plan.

201
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,303
- Let's do this.
- Oh, yeah.

202
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:54,691
What. What.

203
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:56,526
What. What.

204
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:03,741
Texas here we come.

205
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:11,416
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

206
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,834
Jesus Christ.

207
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:14,127
Go, go.

208
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,134
Fuck.

209
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,220
- What'd you get?
- All this.

210
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:27,765
You like?
Because it was, like, 25 bucks.

211
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:29,642
Get out. That's a rip-off.

212
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:32,562
Don't worry about it, honey.
It's on your credit card.

213
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:35,523
Oh, yeah? Well, that's okay.
You know why?

214
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:37,150
Because...

215
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,737
- Kenny paid for the gas.
- What?

216
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:42,572
What the... Give me that.

217
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:44,449
- How'd you get that, man?
- Oh, Kenny.

218
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:47,744
- Don't cry.
- It's okay. Let's go, baby.

219
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:49,329
- Ready?
- Baby, let's go.

220
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:54,918
What was that?

221
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:00,048
Jesus, dude, you all right?

222
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:01,799
Oh, my God.

223
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,893
- Yeah, it's all right.
- You hit him, Kenny.

224
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:07,055
Sorry, I didn't see you, man.

225
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:08,139
It's all right.

226
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:12,018
I should probably sue.

227
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:15,658
But I will settle for a stick of that jerky.

228
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:19,901
Say, where you all headed?

229
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:21,444
New Orleans.

230
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:23,571
You're kidding. That's great.

231
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:25,615
- That where you going?
- No, no.

232
00:17:25,907 --> 00:17:27,992
Shreveport? It's on the way.

233
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:29,953
Did your car break? Where's your car?

234
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,081
Uh, that's a bit of a long story.

235
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:37,961
Short of it is my lady dumped my butt and
I have been thumbing my way back from Tulsa.

236
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:40,588
I sure could use a ride.

237
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,240
Ain't got no problem paying my way.

238
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:45,552
60 bucks.

239
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,263
You will be doing a guy a favor.
Help a fella out.

240
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:50,265
Rain?

241
00:17:50,932 --> 00:17:52,767
- Okay. Come on.
- Yeah?

242
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:55,770
We have to stop in Texas on the way.

243
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,939
Well, sure beats walking.

244
00:17:58,815 --> 00:17:59,816
All right.

245
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:34,726
You okay?

246
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:37,645
Yeah. I am good.

247
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:42,191
- You scared at all?
- No.

248
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:46,738
I am just wondering where I fit, you know?

249
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,239
Yeah.

250
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:51,409
So, what's in Newt?

251
00:18:53,661 --> 00:18:55,038
One-sided family reunion.

252
00:18:56,372 --> 00:18:58,833
My grandmother died.
I got to sign some papers.

253
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:02,712
My condolences. Were you two close?

254
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:05,298
I just learned about her yesterday.

255
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:06,799
But family's family.

256
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,468
Amen, sister.

257
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,349
Family is a messy business.

258
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:16,142
Ain't nothing thicker than blood.

259
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:48,758
So, do you know anything about this place?

260
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:50,968
Just the address.

261
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:52,951
We're just in and out, right?

262
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,514
That's the deal.

263
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,100
We'd never find this at night.

264
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,464
What the hell?
We wouldn't be able to see anything.

265
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:00,978
Hey, this is it.

266
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:03,022
This is Homestead Road. Make a left.

267
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:17,277
This can't be it, right?

268
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,038
He said a big gate.

269
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,084
Wow.

270
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:29,799
Wow.

271
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,052
Well, there's got to be
something behind there.

272
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:34,509
Like a castle or something.

273
00:20:35,263 --> 00:20:36,431
All right.

274
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,627
Mr. Farnsworth? I am Heather.

275
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:10,006
I could tell from the car. Dead ringer.

276
00:21:10,006 --> 00:21:11,891
Thank you for coming
all the way from Dallas.

277
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:13,468
Anything for Verna.

278
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:15,970
She was a good woman. Salt of the earth.

279
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,308
Though not the most popular in these parts.

280
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:23,686
I didn't know you were bringing friends.

281
00:21:24,187 --> 00:21:25,188
Is that okay?

282
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:29,192
Well, it's your house, if you want it.

283
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:31,694
Just so you know...

284
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:34,530
Verna's trust forbids you from selling it.

285
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,389
It's all described in these papers.

286
00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:38,242
Okay. Thanks.

287
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:41,496
You can't quite see the house from here.

288
00:21:42,163 --> 00:21:44,999
But it's just up beyond those trees.

289
00:21:48,336 --> 00:21:52,840
These keys, they open
everything inside and out.

290
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,218
Verna was big on security.

291
00:21:57,512 --> 00:22:00,952
"0"-"8"-"19".

292
00:22:02,183 --> 00:22:03,559
Best to remember it as a date.

293
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:04,811
August 19th.

294
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:07,855
Right. And the gates work automatically
from the other side.

295
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:12,976
I have a house. And a whole list of
assets that I will be forwarding to you

296
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,862
as soon as the accountants sign off.

297
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:18,741
Oh. I almost forgot.

298
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:21,786
The most important thing.

299
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:24,956
It's from Verna. Make sure you read it.

300
00:22:24,956 --> 00:22:26,457
Okay. I will.

301
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:30,044
And call me if you have any questions.

302
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,298
You're not coming in?

303
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:36,759
Uh...

304
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,512
No. I promised some other
folks I'd stop by.

305
00:22:39,804 --> 00:22:41,305
Don't forget to read Verna's letter.

306
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:43,808
Hey.

307
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,601
How did you find me?

308
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,230
Find you? Honey, you were never lost.

309
00:23:34,817 --> 00:23:38,360
It's a mansion. Oh, my God.

310
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:46,120
- Wow.
- Sweet.

311
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:49,749
No way. Oh, my God, girl.

312
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,250
- Wow.
- Are you kidding?

313
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,960
This is nicer than the outside.

314
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:55,963
- I don't know where to start.
- How about here?

315
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:02,470
What is going on here?

316
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,470
Wow.

317
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:06,557
Some fine dining.

318
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:11,145
- Heather, can I open this one?
- Yeah.

319
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:15,524
- Wow.
- Wow.

320
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:19,278
This is definitely worth coming home to.

321
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:20,363
Want some tea?

322
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:22,365
It's all set up.

323
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:23,783
So, Heather.

324
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:26,869
What exactly did Granny do for a living?

325
00:24:27,828 --> 00:24:29,080
I have no idea.

326
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,831
Hey. Check this out.

327
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,969
Look like Granny
liked to play a little pool.

328
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:38,673
- Who want to play?
- I do.

329
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:41,592
- Got money, bitch?
- Okay, I am a bitch now.

330
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:43,010
Yeah, you're my bitch.

331
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:44,428
Okay, rack them up.

332
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:46,313
- What'd you say about my rack?
- Rack them up.

333
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,766
- Oh.
- Whoo.

334
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,518
Now it's a party.

335
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:53,187
- Nice.
- Oh, I scratched.

336
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,606
Oh, too bad.

337
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,525
Ouch.

338
00:24:58,067 --> 00:24:59,188
All right. You want to see me?

339
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:00,994
I am going to dominate you.
Where's the white one?

340
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:11,932
Thank you.

341
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,996
Hey. What's going on?

342
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:36,207
This house is insane.

343
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:38,167
God, we got to stay the night.
It's too cool.

344
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:39,960
That kitchen is so amazing.

345
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,462
You all have to let
me cook for you tonight.

346
00:26:41,712 --> 00:26:43,192
Yeah. And you can thank Darryl.

347
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:45,674
He's the one splurging on the
steaks, ain't that right?

348
00:26:45,674 --> 00:26:47,218
Hey, Shreveport can wait.

349
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:49,102
I needed something
like this for a long time.

350
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:50,179
Thanks, you guys.

351
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,431
God, is he a Boy Scout or what?

352
00:26:53,724 --> 00:26:56,102
- Come on.
- No, I am overkill on this mission.

353
00:26:56,644 --> 00:26:59,021
I am going to get the bags,
clean up a little.

354
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:24,588
Yeah, I am a regular Boy Scout.

355
00:28:02,668 --> 00:28:06,297
All right. So let's, uh,
divide and conquer.

356
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:07,741
Will you take care of that for me?

357
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:16,323
We will see you in a
few weeks, Mr. Mayor.

358
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,521
Burt. Wish I had a swing
like that in my backyard.

359
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:23,926
Yeah, that's something all right.

360
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,233
Hello, precious.

361
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:27,651
Whoo.

362
00:28:35,868 --> 00:28:36,869
Come on, baby.

363
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:41,665
Where's your mama? Where's your mama?

364
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:43,667
Where's your mama?

365
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:47,087
I am going to get, like,
one more thing and then I am done.

366
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:49,089
- All right. I will meet you outside.
- Cool.

367
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:51,425
There's, like, a carnival
or something going on?

368
00:28:57,097 --> 00:28:59,099
Price check. Fuck are you doing?

369
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:00,976
Nobody's looking.

370
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:03,479
Listen, it was one time.

371
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:07,066
One time. And I had,
like, 18 kamikazes. Come on.

372
00:29:08,651 --> 00:29:09,985
Come on. You begged for it.

373
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:14,198
And now I am begging you to
keep your hands off my shit.

374
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:18,619
- Okay.
- All right.

375
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:17,720
Beautiful big door for a beautiful big key.

376
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:26,478
Oh, I got your stash now, you old cunt.

377
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:34,044
What am I going to do with a bunch of wine?

378
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:46,707
What the hell is this?

379
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:58,719
Here we go. Come on.

380
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:02,639
Come on.

381
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:05,517
I have dealt with stubborn bitches before.

382
00:31:06,518 --> 00:31:08,771
You just need some kicking.

383
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:10,689
Now, honey.

384
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:24,787
I am coming back here.
I don't quit easy.

385
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:57,194
You're asking for trouble.

386
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:01,899
That wouldn't burn
if you doused it with a fuel tanker.

387
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:05,924
This here will give you some good flavor.

388
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,288
But if you want to unleash some hellfire,

389
00:32:09,706 --> 00:32:10,874
this here's the stuff.

390
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:13,377
Good to know.

391
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:18,549
In town for the carnival?

392
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:21,427
Just a little housewarming.

393
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,722
Well, you best keep it down.

394
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,086
I'd hate to have to haul you in.

395
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:28,684
I will try to behave.

396
00:32:29,768 --> 00:32:31,353
- How much is this?
- That will be $9.

397
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:32,758
So, whereabouts is this shindig?

398
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,941
Homestead Road.

399
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:38,945
Ain't nothing out there
but the old Carson place.

400
00:32:38,945 --> 00:32:39,987
That's the one.

401
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:42,019
I thought that place was empty.

402
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:43,323
Not anymore.

403
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:44,950
This officer bothering you?

404
00:32:46,326 --> 00:32:48,078
Say the word and I will shoot him.

405
00:32:48,078 --> 00:32:49,163
He will, too.

406
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,832
Go read some meters.

407
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:58,088
Burt Hartman, proud mayor
of this little slice of paradise.

408
00:32:58,088 --> 00:32:59,173
How're you doing?

409
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,093
- Heather.
- Nice to meet you, Heather.

410
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,013
Now, my ears aren't what they used to be,

411
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:08,835
but I swear I could have heard you say
something about the Carson place.

412
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:10,517
I inherited it.

413
00:33:11,518 --> 00:33:13,770
- You're a Carson?
- No.

414
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:17,232
- You're not a Sawyer.
- Yep.

415
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,235
Yeah, you have got her eyes.

416
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:21,945
- You knew her?
- Yeah.

417
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:23,530
Me and your family go way back.

418
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:27,075
And I know they wouldn't want you to
be burdened with that beat-up old trap.

419
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:28,160
Tell you what.

420
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:30,370
I will take the whole place off your hands.

421
00:33:30,662 --> 00:33:31,663
No, thanks.

422
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:34,666
Going to hardball me, huh?
Hell, I like you already.

423
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:35,876
Come on, let's go.

424
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:38,003
Come on. Give me a number.

425
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:46,053
Yo.

426
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:47,554
Oh.

427
00:33:47,804 --> 00:33:49,765
- Oh, shit.
- What?

428
00:33:50,224 --> 00:33:51,225
Fucking thief.

429
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:55,312
He took my keys.

430
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:59,066
- Wow, he played that smooth.
- Yeah, he did.

431
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:00,567
We should have never picked that guy up.

432
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:01,652
Yo.

433
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:04,905
- Whoo.
- Let's do this right.

434
00:34:06,532 --> 00:34:08,408
- What's wrong?
- Darryl ripped us off.

435
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:12,329
So he heisted some ashtrays
and candlesticks.

436
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:15,541
That shouldn't keep you
from having a good time. Come on.

437
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,334
- Cheers, you guys.
- Yeah.

438
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:18,794
To happiness.

439
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:22,172
- To the queen.
- Yeah.

440
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:24,758
- To the Sawyers.
- To the Sawyers.

441
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:26,093
Sawyers. All right.

442
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,517
Hey, there's a butler's pantry in here.

443
00:36:47,943 --> 00:36:48,944
Darryl?

444
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:56,243
Darryl?

445
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:03,041
Yo, Darryl.

446
00:37:18,432 --> 00:37:19,433
Darryl.

447
00:38:05,479 --> 00:38:06,605
Oh, my God, you have got to see this.

448
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:07,689
What?

449
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:09,816
- It's so fucked up. Come on.
- Whoa, what's wrong?

450
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,151
Come on.

451
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:16,031
- It's right down there.
- Where?

452
00:38:16,031 --> 00:38:18,366
- It's right down there.
- Where?

453
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:20,327
It's in that stall, right there.

454
00:38:20,952 --> 00:38:22,621
- In here?
- Oh, God.

455
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:25,749
Nikki, I don't see shit.

456
00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:29,252
It's right under that bucket.
It's under that bucket right there.

457
00:38:29,252 --> 00:38:30,504
It's right under that bucket.

458
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:33,173
Okay.

459
00:38:41,848 --> 00:38:43,016
What the hell, Nikki?

460
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,520
What are you doing?

461
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,027
I told you it was fucked up.

462
00:39:52,794 --> 00:39:53,795
Ryan.

463
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,090
Ryan.

464
00:39:59,843 --> 00:40:00,844
You guys.

465
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:09,060
Kenny?

466
00:44:33,616 --> 00:44:34,617
Dude, what the...

467
00:44:35,827 --> 00:44:38,996
What is that? What the...
What is he doing?

468
00:44:39,873 --> 00:44:40,874
Who is that?

469
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:44,419
Hey. Hey.

470
00:44:49,048 --> 00:44:50,049
Hey.

471
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:53,595
- Go.
- What?

472
00:44:53,595 --> 00:44:55,721
- Oh, my God.
- Go.

473
00:45:00,852 --> 00:45:03,395
- Move. Move.
- Close the door.

474
00:45:31,591 --> 00:45:33,343
Welcome to Texas, motherfucker.

475
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:41,434
Did you hit him?

476
00:45:42,101 --> 00:45:43,102
I don't know.

477
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:44,771
- Did you hit him?
- I don't know.

478
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:49,896
Something's coming. Back up.

479
00:45:50,276 --> 00:45:52,527
Back up. Back up, Nikki.

480
00:45:54,697 --> 00:45:56,590
- Get in the van.
- It's Heather.

481
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,034
Move over, move over. Let me in.
Hurry and get us out of here. Go.

482
00:45:58,034 --> 00:46:00,286
Move over, move over. Let me in.
Hurry and get us out of here. Go.

483
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:01,955
Go, go, go, go.

484
00:46:07,627 --> 00:46:09,878
Go......

485
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:12,548
Go. Go.

486
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:15,885
Go, go, go.

487
00:46:17,387 --> 00:46:18,471
What the hell was that?

488
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,600
Where's Kenny?

489
00:46:23,726 --> 00:46:25,186
He's dead. They're fucking dead.

490
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:32,735
Ryan, slow down. Slow down.
The gate, the gate needs to open.

491
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:34,362
Ryan, slow down. Slow down.
The gate, the gate needs to open.

492
00:46:34,362 --> 00:46:36,049
- Give it time to open.
- We got to go.

493
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:37,282
Fuck the gate. Buckle up.

494
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:48,084
- What happened?
- The car stopped.

495
00:46:48,084 --> 00:46:49,168
Why?

496
00:46:49,419 --> 00:46:51,904
Okay, back it up. Back...

497
00:46:54,465 --> 00:46:56,384
- Ryan.
- Back it up, back it up, back it up.

498
00:46:56,384 --> 00:46:58,107
- Back up the car.
- What's wrong with it?

499
00:46:58,511 --> 00:46:59,887
- Ryan, go.
- I am fucking trying.

500
00:47:00,096 --> 00:47:01,806
- Back up the car.
- It won't start.

501
00:47:04,183 --> 00:47:05,643
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

502
00:47:05,935 --> 00:47:09,854
- Back up. Here we go.
- Here we go. Back up. Back up.

503
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:14,319
Wait for the gate to open.

504
00:47:16,237 --> 00:47:17,613
- Fuck.
- Ryan.

505
00:47:17,613 --> 00:47:18,781
Ryan. Start it.

506
00:47:20,616 --> 00:47:22,160
- Go Ryan, go.
- It won't start.

507
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:25,079
Now, go, go, go.

508
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,123
- Ryan, go.
- Ryan, go.

509
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,042
- Ryan, go.
- Come on.

510
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:30,501
- Go, go.
- Please, go.

511
00:47:31,794 --> 00:47:32,795
Come on.

512
00:47:41,346 --> 00:47:42,347
Here he comes.

513
00:48:08,828 --> 00:48:10,148
Ryan. Ryan.

514
00:48:35,942 --> 00:48:37,568
Heather, what happened?

515
00:48:42,532 --> 00:48:43,699
What?

516
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:47,787
Quiet. Quiet.

517
00:48:51,749 --> 00:48:53,292
We got to get out of here now.

518
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:55,044
We got to get out of here right now.

519
00:49:03,845 --> 00:49:06,472
Get away, get away,
he's coming over here.

520
00:49:11,102 --> 00:49:12,103
My leg.

521
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:15,440
My leg. No, Nikki.

522
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:51,267
Hey. Hey, you country fuck.

523
00:50:30,431 --> 00:50:31,932
Run, run.

524
00:50:38,564 --> 00:50:40,066
Hey, want to play a game?

525
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:43,402
Call the police.

526
00:50:48,908 --> 00:50:51,077
Get out of the way. Call the police.

527
00:50:53,955 --> 00:50:55,748
- Go. Get out of the way.
- What the hell?

528
00:51:01,921 --> 00:51:03,047
What is going on?

529
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,132
Hey. Hey.

530
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:40,793
Drop the fucking saw.

531
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:43,379
I said, drop it.

532
00:51:43,379 --> 00:51:44,463
Put it down.

533
00:52:06,485 --> 00:52:07,525
Where's the girl?

534
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:09,113
Carl is tending to her in the back.

535
00:52:09,113 --> 00:52:10,323
All right.

536
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:20,958
Sheriff? This is Marvin.
I am at the crash site.

537
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,918
- You copy?
- Go ahead, Marvin.

538
00:52:23,628 --> 00:52:25,068
Approaching the vehicle now.

539
00:52:25,504 --> 00:52:27,923
Late model VW bus on its side.

540
00:52:30,092 --> 00:52:31,093
It's a real mess.

541
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:34,066
- Do you need an ambulance?
- Checking now.

542
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:39,602
That's a negative.
No one. No victims on the scene.

543
00:52:41,354 --> 00:52:44,690
Sheriff? There's blood everywhere.

544
00:52:45,274 --> 00:52:48,944
Seat's all sawed up.
Somebody died out here.

545
00:52:49,654 --> 00:52:51,974
All right, stay where you are, Marvin.
I will get back at you.

546
00:52:52,365 --> 00:52:53,366
Roger that.

547
00:53:10,091 --> 00:53:12,677
- Hey.
- They find her?

548
00:53:14,136 --> 00:53:15,137
We will.

549
00:53:17,515 --> 00:53:20,226
- Got you a shirt here.
- Thanks.

550
00:53:20,226 --> 00:53:21,394
At least it's clean.

551
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,420
I should have never brought them here.

552
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,822
Look, this town ain't much,
but we take care of our own here.

553
00:53:33,656 --> 00:53:35,408
He will be a sack of meat scraps by dawn.

554
00:53:36,534 --> 00:53:37,743
You can count on it.

555
00:53:39,078 --> 00:53:40,079
Carl.

556
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,669
- Take your time.
- Okay.

557
00:53:57,638 --> 00:53:59,265
Sheriff Hooper? This is Heather.

558
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:00,349
Hi.

559
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:01,517
You the girl that guy was chasing?

560
00:54:01,517 --> 00:54:02,685
Yeah.

561
00:54:02,685 --> 00:54:05,104
He killed my friends, but Nikki...

562
00:54:05,813 --> 00:54:07,314
She was still alive after the crash.

563
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:09,275
Yeah, we're on it,
but there was no one at the site.

564
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:11,842
No, she was there. I left her there.
He must have moved them.

565
00:54:11,842 --> 00:54:12,987
Do you know who he is?

566
00:54:12,987 --> 00:54:15,990
No. He was in the house, he was...

567
00:54:16,198 --> 00:54:18,075
- What house?
- The Carson Estate.

568
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:22,747
My grandmother left it to me.
Verna Carson.

569
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:24,665
We just got here a few hours ago.

570
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:28,127
I am a Sawyer,
if that's your next question.

571
00:54:28,461 --> 00:54:30,463
Sheriff, I dug through the evidence room.

572
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,691
Pulled out what we had on Verna Carson.

573
00:54:33,632 --> 00:54:35,176
Also pulled a big file on the Sawyers.

574
00:54:35,176 --> 00:54:36,677
You get a good look at him?

575
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:38,137
He was wearing a face.

576
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:40,014
A mask?

577
00:54:42,683 --> 00:54:43,768
A human face.

578
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:48,731
Carl, we're a little short-handed.

579
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:51,400
I am going to need you out on the street.
Get going.

580
00:54:53,486 --> 00:54:55,087
Sheriff, the mayor just got here.

581
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:56,447
He's looking for you.

582
00:54:57,782 --> 00:54:58,783
Thanks.

583
00:54:59,658 --> 00:55:01,827
Take a seat.
I will be back in a minute.

584
00:55:06,165 --> 00:55:07,966
Some fucking crazy
just tore up the carnival.

585
00:55:07,966 --> 00:55:09,835
I need to know what the police
are going to do about it.

586
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:11,128
My office.

587
00:55:15,508 --> 00:55:16,550
I think it may be Jed.

588
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:18,052
Jed Sawyer?

589
00:55:18,302 --> 00:55:19,637
No way.

590
00:55:19,929 --> 00:55:21,639
We burned that place
to the ground years ago, Hooper.

591
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:23,057
You were there. No one escaped.

592
00:55:23,057 --> 00:55:25,184
Well, maybe he crawled out
through the back. I don't know.

593
00:55:25,476 --> 00:55:26,936
You telling me he's been
holed up all these years

594
00:55:26,936 --> 00:55:28,187
and now he's running around on the loose?

595
00:55:28,187 --> 00:55:30,898
I am telling you a 6'5 man

596
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:35,194
came out of Verna Carson's house
wearing a skin mask and wielding that.

597
00:55:35,694 --> 00:55:36,775
Sheriff?

598
00:55:37,196 --> 00:55:38,614
I am at the Carson place.

599
00:55:39,365 --> 00:55:40,533
Gate's busted open.

600
00:55:41,492 --> 00:55:43,828
There's a broken side mirror that
looks like it matches the van.

601
00:55:43,828 --> 00:55:45,955
Marvin, I told you to stay at the van.

602
00:55:45,955 --> 00:55:47,039
Now, that's an order. Do you copy?

603
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:48,666
Hell, no. That's not how we play this.

604
00:55:48,874 --> 00:55:50,626
There's a blood trail on the pavement.

605
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:53,003
Sheriff, no disrespect,
but I think I need to move on this.

606
00:55:53,003 --> 00:55:54,648
That's not your call, Officer.

607
00:55:55,005 --> 00:55:57,383
Marvin. This is Mayor Hartman.
You got your Eagle?

608
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:59,033
You know it, with an extended clip.

609
00:56:00,553 --> 00:56:02,012
Just looking for a reason, sir.

610
00:56:02,221 --> 00:56:03,782
Then what the hell are you waiting for?

611
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:06,559
Marvin, stand down.

612
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,352
Now, we believe Jed Sawyer may be alive.

613
00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:09,640
And he may be in that house.

614
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,524
Copy that, sir,
but a chainsaw don't make you bulletproof.

615
00:57:40,694 --> 00:57:41,737
Door's wide open.

616
00:57:42,446 --> 00:57:43,822
This is a mistake.

617
00:57:43,822 --> 00:57:45,546
Now, stop it now before you get him hurt.

618
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,254
- It's hot pursuit, Hooper.
- I am going in.

619
00:57:52,581 --> 00:57:53,582
Police.

620
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:05,511
Yeah.

621
00:58:05,511 --> 00:58:08,138
- Give me a visual.
- You got it.

622
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:13,185
Moving.

623
00:59:03,694 --> 00:59:04,737
This is on you, Burt.

624
00:59:04,737 --> 00:59:06,238
Eye for an eye, Sheriff.

625
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:07,573
Can't get around the Good Book.

626
00:59:16,081 --> 00:59:17,241
Entering the kitchen.

627
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:18,584
Proceed.

628
00:59:26,175 --> 00:59:27,301
What the hell?

629
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:33,348
Following the blood.

630
00:59:37,436 --> 00:59:38,437
Jesus.

631
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:41,648
You seeing this?

632
00:59:42,608 --> 00:59:43,609
Shit.

633
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:50,032
Looks like it leads to this door.

634
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:52,284
Push it open.

635
01:00:00,793 --> 01:00:01,877
What the hell is this?

636
01:00:02,461 --> 01:00:03,629
Proceed, Officer.

637
01:00:08,842 --> 01:00:10,094
I don't know about this, Burt.

638
01:00:10,302 --> 01:00:12,622
God damn it. Do I got to come down there
and hold your hand?

639
01:00:40,999 --> 01:00:42,239
So, where are you now?

640
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,418
I am in the wine cellar.

641
01:00:50,134 --> 01:00:52,136
There's an opening to some kind of...

642
01:00:54,513 --> 01:00:55,514
I don't know.

643
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,351
Going through.

644
01:01:04,857 --> 01:01:08,360
Looks like some kind of crazy catacomb.

645
01:01:12,865 --> 01:01:14,366
Still following the blood.

646
01:01:27,546 --> 01:01:29,756
Getting a bad feeling here.

647
01:01:48,775 --> 01:01:50,444
Jesus Christ. What is this?

648
01:01:57,701 --> 01:01:58,702
It's a haven?

649
01:02:11,882 --> 01:02:12,883
Dresses.

650
01:02:18,138 --> 01:02:19,139
High heels.

651
01:02:21,099 --> 01:02:22,434
Little farm toys.

652
01:02:23,143 --> 01:02:24,269
Bones.

653
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:25,812
Man.

654
01:02:30,943 --> 01:02:35,113
Ladies makeup? What a fruitcake.

655
01:03:18,448 --> 01:03:19,908
This is the most disturbing place

656
01:03:19,908 --> 01:03:21,034
that I have ever been.

657
01:03:21,285 --> 01:03:22,327
What's that to your left?

658
01:03:22,995 --> 01:03:23,996
It's a door.

659
01:03:23,996 --> 01:03:25,839
Marvin, keep your hands on that gun.

660
01:03:31,086 --> 01:03:32,713
My fucking God.

661
01:03:34,298 --> 01:03:35,299
How many?

662
01:03:37,467 --> 01:03:38,927
You tell me.

663
01:03:39,177 --> 01:03:40,512
What fucking human does that?

664
01:03:44,808 --> 01:03:46,685
Shit, this is fucked up.

665
01:03:51,898 --> 01:03:53,025
What's in there?

666
01:03:53,317 --> 01:03:54,443
What's in the freezer?

667
01:03:59,531 --> 01:04:00,652
Be careful, Marvin.

668
01:04:19,843 --> 01:04:20,844
Oh.

669
01:04:22,262 --> 01:04:23,263
Shit.

670
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:24,556
It's okay. It's okay. Didn't happen.

671
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,808
Marvin. You get the hell
out of there right now.

672
01:04:30,855 --> 01:04:32,606
That sick fuck will
be back out there tonight.

673
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,024
We rally the boys,

674
01:04:34,024 --> 01:04:35,734
we torch that place to the ground.

675
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:38,236
End this. Finish what we started years ago.

676
01:04:38,737 --> 01:04:40,238
Not this time. Not on my watch.

677
01:05:30,288 --> 01:05:33,041
- What happened that day was a travesty.
- It was justice.

678
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:36,336
I want to see the Sawyer girl.

679
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,297
She's a victim, Burt.
She hasn't done anything.

680
01:05:39,923 --> 01:05:41,425
She's breathing, ain't she?

681
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,438
Yeah, I know what you're thinking, Burt.

682
01:05:54,729 --> 01:05:55,939
You have no idea.

683
01:05:58,358 --> 01:06:00,068
Nothing better happen to that girl, Burt.

684
01:06:16,918 --> 01:06:19,079
- Hello, Farnsworth here.
- Hi. This is Heather Miller.

685
01:06:20,005 --> 01:06:21,715
My friends have all been killed.

686
01:06:21,715 --> 01:06:23,550
I just found out about August 19th.

687
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:24,885
How could you leave us
alone in that house?

688
01:06:25,177 --> 01:06:27,345
Okay. Where are you?

689
01:06:28,138 --> 01:06:29,514
I am at the bank on Main Street.

690
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,933
Uh, meet me at Johnny B. Red's.

691
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:33,518
It's a bar about a quarter mile,

692
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:35,687
east on Fifth and Main.

693
01:06:35,687 --> 01:06:36,980
I will be there in 20 minutes.

694
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:41,776
I want your Halloween candy.

695
01:06:41,776 --> 01:06:43,361
Come on and party with us.

696
01:08:49,029 --> 01:08:50,697
Why didn't you warn me?

697
01:08:50,697 --> 01:08:51,865
All my friends are dead.

698
01:08:51,865 --> 01:08:54,034
My family was wiped out by this crazy town.

699
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:56,703
- Did you read Verna's letter?
- No.

700
01:08:57,162 --> 01:08:58,705
Well, I asked you to, right?

701
01:09:00,457 --> 01:09:03,043
Verna was very particular.
I am sure she laid it all out.

702
01:09:03,335 --> 01:09:04,419
But you knew about him.

703
01:09:04,419 --> 01:09:06,303
You knew about this town.
You knew everything.

704
01:09:06,504 --> 01:09:07,505
Oh, okay.

705
01:09:08,173 --> 01:09:09,174
Okay, so who is he?

706
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:13,637
Well, the person in the basement

707
01:09:15,055 --> 01:09:16,556
is Jedidiah Sawyer.

708
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:18,350
Goes by Jed.

709
01:09:19,351 --> 01:09:20,352
He's your cousin.

710
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,521
For years I suspected something,

711
01:09:23,521 --> 01:09:28,234
but I never knew for sure about Jed
until about 4 months ago when Verna,

712
01:09:29,694 --> 01:09:32,405
who was very sick, presented him to me.

713
01:09:33,156 --> 01:09:36,660
A grown man, huge, but mentally stunted.

714
01:09:37,869 --> 01:09:40,372
With emotions of an 8-year-old.

715
01:09:41,706 --> 01:09:43,541
Frankly, he scared the shit out of me.

716
01:09:44,376 --> 01:09:45,377
Why'd she keep him?

717
01:09:47,045 --> 01:09:49,381
Nobody loves you like
your family, I guess.

718
01:09:49,714 --> 01:09:51,091
She preserved you, too.

719
01:09:51,392 --> 01:09:55,053
She investigated everyone
who was involved with the...

720
01:09:55,762 --> 01:09:56,888
August 19th.

721
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:58,431
Found you right away.

722
01:09:58,431 --> 01:10:00,035
And she let me live with those people?

723
01:10:00,433 --> 01:10:01,893
You were safer there.

724
01:10:03,228 --> 01:10:06,106
And she knew
there would always come a day.

725
01:10:07,565 --> 01:10:09,067
Jed knows about you, too.

726
01:10:09,609 --> 01:10:10,735
That was some welcome.

727
01:10:13,196 --> 01:10:14,948
He doesn't know who you are.

728
01:10:15,407 --> 01:10:18,952
And the last time a girl got away,
Jed lost his whole family.

729
01:10:18,952 --> 01:10:21,913
So, he will stay after you.
He doesn't know any better.

730
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:23,540
Burt Hartman, too.

731
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:27,043
After reading that police file,

732
01:10:27,043 --> 01:10:29,754
you know this town's dirty little secret.

733
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:35,135
- Burt. Burt.
- Yeah.

734
01:10:36,636 --> 01:10:37,637
Let me through.

735
01:10:37,887 --> 01:10:39,407
Let's go. I am getting you out of here.

736
01:10:40,432 --> 01:10:41,516
- Move.
- Hey.

737
01:10:41,516 --> 01:10:43,119
- Out of my way.
- What's your problem?

738
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:44,602
Use the back door. Yeah, take it.

739
01:10:46,563 --> 01:10:47,605
Burt.

740
01:11:02,203 --> 01:11:03,413
I got her, Burt.

741
01:11:06,332 --> 01:11:07,333
She's right here.

742
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,962
You going somewhere, precious?

743
01:11:11,254 --> 01:11:12,297
Huh?

744
01:11:12,297 --> 01:11:13,047
Oh.

745
01:11:16,509 --> 01:11:18,762
She cut me. Burt.

746
01:11:23,475 --> 01:11:25,059
That little bitch.

747
01:11:25,059 --> 01:11:26,686
She won't get far, that's for sure.

748
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:29,272
Come on. Get up now.

749
01:11:35,153 --> 01:11:37,989
Stop. Stop. Stop.

750
01:11:40,867 --> 01:11:41,868
What's going on?

751
01:11:41,868 --> 01:11:43,203
Burt Hartman and his guys,

752
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:45,079
they beat up my lawyer at the bar.

753
01:11:45,079 --> 01:11:46,289
And they're after me.

754
01:11:47,707 --> 01:11:49,334
Okay, come on. Let's give you a ride.

755
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:52,170
We have to stop at the bar.
We have to go back.

756
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,338
Okay.

757
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:09,020
There he is. That's Farnsworth.

758
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,563
That's the place. Stop the car.

759
01:12:11,022 --> 01:12:12,023
Stop the car.

760
01:12:12,524 --> 01:12:13,733
That's the bar. Stop.

761
01:12:13,733 --> 01:12:15,193
Let me out. What are you doing?

762
01:12:18,363 --> 01:12:19,781
Stop the fucking car.

763
01:12:20,073 --> 01:12:21,115
What are you doing?

764
01:12:23,785 --> 01:12:24,786
Yep?

765
01:12:24,786 --> 01:12:26,794
Sawyer girl's loose.
She's headed towards town.

766
01:12:27,205 --> 01:12:29,332
Yeah, yeah. I got her.
She's in the back.

767
01:12:29,582 --> 01:12:30,982
What do you want me to do with her?

768
01:12:30,982 --> 01:12:34,593
Tell you what, take her up to
the slaughterhouse and hold her.

769
01:12:35,713 --> 01:12:38,424
I am dealing with Ollie.
She sliced him good.

770
01:12:39,217 --> 01:12:40,385
Just give me a few minutes.

771
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:42,262
Okay.

772
01:12:42,554 --> 01:12:43,555
You got it, Dad.

773
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:46,683
That's your fucking dad?

774
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:50,144
Fucking stop the car.

775
01:12:50,436 --> 01:12:51,479
Let me out.

776
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:54,065
Open the door, you liar.

777
01:12:57,569 --> 01:12:59,696
Okay, Marvin, do you copy?

778
01:12:59,946 --> 01:13:01,698
We have the girl from the Carson house.

779
01:13:02,907 --> 01:13:04,367
Come on, Marvin, pick up.

780
01:13:05,159 --> 01:13:06,828
Are you there? Come on, Marvin.

781
01:13:09,706 --> 01:13:12,667
That you, Marvin? If you can hear me,

782
01:13:12,876 --> 01:13:14,437
then meet us out at the slaughterhouse.

783
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:34,344
Sheriff, I represent Verna Carson's
estate and her granddaughter, Heather.

784
01:13:34,564 --> 01:13:35,523
I know who she is.

785
01:13:35,523 --> 01:13:37,191
Well, at this very moment,
she's in the back of

786
01:13:37,191 --> 01:13:41,195
one of your police cars against her will
heading out of town, out past Johnny B. Red's.

787
01:13:41,654 --> 01:13:42,655
All right, come with me.

788
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:48,077
She's headed out Highway 28.

789
01:13:49,245 --> 01:13:50,413
There's nothing out there.

790
01:13:52,665 --> 01:13:54,834
Oh, shit. I know where he's headed.

791
01:14:07,305 --> 01:14:08,306
You know,

792
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,060
I thought you were pretty cute.

793
01:14:22,654 --> 01:14:24,280
So you're a Hartman, huh?

794
01:14:26,491 --> 01:14:27,492
Yep.

795
01:14:30,703 --> 01:14:31,704
Whoa.

796
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:36,417
I am a Sawyer.

797
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,521
Please stop.

798
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:18,835
Quit it.

799
01:15:29,887 --> 01:15:30,888
Don't tempt me.

800
01:15:33,725 --> 01:15:35,685
You should feel
right at home in this nasty place.

801
01:15:36,561 --> 01:15:38,271
Your family used to work this shithole.

802
01:16:46,005 --> 01:16:49,342
We will take it from here.
No place for a cop, son.

803
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,181
It's me.

804
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:38,432
It's Heather.

805
01:17:39,183 --> 01:17:40,184
It's your cousin.

806
01:17:40,393 --> 01:17:42,562
It's me. I am Heather.

807
01:17:43,104 --> 01:17:44,272
Please, it's Heather.

808
01:17:55,408 --> 01:17:56,784
Come here. You remember me?

809
01:18:06,294 --> 01:18:08,296
Come on, Ollie.
Let's feed his ass to the shark.

810
01:18:08,296 --> 01:18:09,380
- Move.
- Hit him, Burt.

811
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:11,007
Come here. Move your big ass.

812
01:18:11,757 --> 01:18:13,009
Get up there.

813
01:18:15,553 --> 01:18:17,013
You about to die, motherfucker.

814
01:18:17,013 --> 01:18:20,766
Just like your gammy, your sick cousins
and your damn horrible brother.

815
01:18:21,184 --> 01:18:23,060
Get down. Move.

816
01:18:25,771 --> 01:18:27,982
I am going to end the whole
Sawyer bloodline tonight.

817
01:18:27,982 --> 01:18:29,775
You and your pretty bitch cousin.

818
01:18:30,776 --> 01:18:32,256
Atta boy, Burt. Hit him again.

819
01:18:33,905 --> 01:18:35,907
Motherfucker, you're about to die, boy.

820
01:18:36,908 --> 01:18:38,034
Son of a bitch.

821
01:18:38,034 --> 01:18:40,437
- Go get that chain, Ollie.
- All right. I will get it, Burt.

822
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,582
Grotesque excuse for a man.

823
01:18:45,416 --> 01:18:46,584
You're not going to get
off that easy, boy.

824
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:48,562
I am going to enjoy this
shit, you hear me?

825
01:18:48,794 --> 01:18:50,004
- Hurry up, Ollie.
- I got it.

826
01:18:50,254 --> 01:18:51,255
Give me that.

827
01:18:54,258 --> 01:18:56,010
You're about to
get chewed up like a fucking cow.

828
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:58,262
Fit for a pig meal,
is what you will be.

829
01:19:00,806 --> 01:19:02,308
Turn it on, Ollie and
fire it up. Let's go.

830
01:19:02,308 --> 01:19:03,684
All right, Burt. I am on it.

831
01:19:03,684 --> 01:19:04,769
Bet your ass, boy.

832
01:19:05,811 --> 01:19:07,491
I am going to enjoy
watching you get chewed up.

833
01:19:15,196 --> 01:19:16,530
You son of a bitch.

834
01:19:16,781 --> 01:19:18,366
This is my town, you fucking cockroach.

835
01:19:18,366 --> 01:19:19,450
She rolling, Burt.

836
01:19:22,712 --> 01:19:27,083
Out of all you Sawyers, all you sick fucks,
the only one that gets out of the fire...

837
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:28,292
is a fucking retard?

838
01:19:28,501 --> 01:19:29,661
How the fuck did that happen?

839
01:19:31,963 --> 01:19:32,964
You remember me?

840
01:19:46,102 --> 01:19:48,104
You got 9 lives? Are you a cat?

841
01:19:48,104 --> 01:19:50,523
You came back.
But you're going to die today,

842
01:19:50,523 --> 01:19:52,167
you motherfucker, just like your daddy.

843
01:19:52,525 --> 01:19:53,985
Your day has come.

844
01:20:05,121 --> 01:20:06,122
Hey.

845
01:20:06,747 --> 01:20:07,748
- Fucker.
- Hey.

846
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:09,500
Hey.

847
01:20:10,126 --> 01:20:11,168
Oh-ho.

848
01:20:11,168 --> 01:20:12,253
Look who's back.

849
01:20:13,421 --> 01:20:14,630
That's right.

850
01:20:18,134 --> 01:20:19,343
Do your thing, coz.

851
01:20:29,645 --> 01:20:31,731
You cockroach.

852
01:20:31,731 --> 01:20:32,857
Bitch, you're dead now.

853
01:20:33,274 --> 01:20:35,634
I will fuck you up, you hear me?
You piece of fucking trash.

854
01:21:06,474 --> 01:21:07,595
Oh, thank God, Hooper.

855
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:08,976
Shoot him.

856
01:21:09,602 --> 01:21:11,312
Come on, shoot him. Shoot him.

857
01:21:11,312 --> 01:21:12,480
Don't shoot.

858
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,065
Hooper. Take him out.

859
01:21:15,358 --> 01:21:17,026
Shoot the fuck. Kill him.

860
01:21:18,944 --> 01:21:20,780
Pull the trigger,
you weak son of a bitch.

861
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:22,615
He's going to kill me.

862
01:21:24,116 --> 01:21:25,785
- Oh, God.
- Don't shoot him.

863
01:21:25,993 --> 01:21:28,829
Hooper. Finish what we started.

864
01:21:55,815 --> 01:21:58,109
Can't get around the Good Book, Burt.

865
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:09,829
Clean this shit up.

866
01:24:14,703 --> 01:24:16,038
Dearest Granddaughter.

867
01:24:17,498 --> 01:24:21,168
This home and all it
comes with, is now yours.

868
01:24:22,795 --> 01:24:26,715
Just know that these gifts
come with certain burdens.

869
01:24:28,634 --> 01:24:32,972
Your real name is Edith Rose Sawyer.

870
01:24:35,224 --> 01:24:39,103
Farnsworth was instructed to give
you a set of keys to the manor.

871
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:42,940
The large key opens the fortified
door to the wine cellar.

872
01:24:43,732 --> 01:24:46,860
There you will discover a metal door.

873
01:24:47,403 --> 01:24:49,154
Behind it lives your cousin,

874
01:24:49,947 --> 01:24:50,948
Jedidiah Sawyer,

875
01:24:53,033 --> 01:24:55,869
your only remaining blood relative.

876
01:24:56,287 --> 01:24:59,456
He's family-bound and will protect you.

877
01:25:00,374 --> 01:25:03,294
He simply requires your care in return.

878
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:09,800
Edith, you are the last
of my line of Sawyer.

879
01:25:11,969 --> 01:25:14,263
My blood runs through you.

880
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,976
The decision to stay is yours.

881
01:25:19,893 --> 01:25:22,771
Just remember, you're a Sawyer

882
01:25:23,314 --> 01:25:25,149
and this is home.

883
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,127
Now, it's your time.

884
01:31:22,506 --> 01:31:25,175
Now remember, you tell her
that you love her.

885
01:31:26,843 --> 01:31:29,554
For this kind of money, I almost do.
