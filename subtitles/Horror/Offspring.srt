1
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,668
God damn it, Nancy!

2
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,543
Fucking babysitters--

3
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,174
always leaving
the goddamn lights on.

4
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,768
Nancy!

5
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,889
My baby?

6
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,727
My baby!

7
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,719
Sorry to wake you, George.

8
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,388
- That's all right.
- I need to talk to you.

9
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,660
I guess you do.
Come on inside.

10
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,291
Actually, I...

11
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,325
was hoping maybe
you could come with us.

12
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,736
I need you to see something for me.

13
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,208
I need your expertise.

14
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,872
Expertise--

15
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,472
not a word I hear real often, Vic.

16
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,915
I've got to warn you, George--

17
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,281
it's ugly.

18
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,189
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah.

19
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,109
Babysitter's mom called it in.

20
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,640
Nancy Ann David.

21
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,813
She was 16 last March.

22
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:53,416
The woman is
Loreen Ellen Kaltsas...

23
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,962
32, separated,

24
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,623
waitress at the All State.

25
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,564
We have her husband in custody

26
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,761
and he admits
to slapping her around some,

27
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,963
but I don't see the connection.

28
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,564
He seems pretty damn worried
about the baby.

29
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,735
Here we go again, huh, George?

30
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,267
Jesus, Max, I hope not.

31
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,770
The reason I think we've got
another go-round is what's not here--

32
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,807
all the meaty bits.

33
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,443
Look familiar?

34
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,146
Cause of death?

35
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,154
Hell, George,
they ripped her heart out.

36
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,939
- Hey.
- Good morning.

37
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,847
- I got to the third board last night.
- I see that.

38
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,915
You got a lot done.

39
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,922
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

40
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,100
What time are
Claire and Luke due?

41
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,867
Around 2:00-ish.

42
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:30,407
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm just--

43
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,917
I'm just thinking about Claire...

44
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,580
and that asshole she married.

45
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:46,121
Hey, would you mind
running the vacuum

46
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,224
in the guest room
in about an hour?

47
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,361
Let Melissa sleep till then.
That way I can get some work done.

48
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,395
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thank you.

49
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:00,334
Oh, damn. I almost forgot--

50
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,973
an amazing thing last night.

51
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,811
Are we aware of any retro-hippy

52
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,082
latter-day commune or something out--

53
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,645
Excuse me?

54
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,684
There was a girl
out here last night--

55
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,423
way out in the field--

56
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,921
nekked as
my mother bore me.

57
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,526
She was 16, 17 maybe.

58
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,628
Naked?

59
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,339
From the waist up.
That's all I could see.

60
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,899
You're kidding.

61
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,014
Well, did she have nice breasts?

62
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,782
Well, she was pretty far away.

63
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,990
- So did you invite her in?
- Why should I?

64
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:51,554
Who wants the wood nymph
when you've got the goddess?

65
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,760
Kind of a saggy goddess.

66
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,564
No, come on.
Goddesses don't sag.

67
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:01,266
They ripen as do
the wheat and the corn.

68
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,572
Corn is about right.

69
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,578
I'm not gonna get
any work done, huh?

70
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,773
I don't think I want
to vacuum either.

71
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,922
We didn't know
what we had 11 years ago

72
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,827
or where to find it.

73
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,731
This time I think
you can assume we do.

74
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,462
Let's say they roam a bit,

75
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,437
which means they're anywhere
between here and Lubec,

76
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,406
maybe down to Cutler.

77
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,341
Now there's plenty of forest
all through that area--

78
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,503
we can't afford to rule it out--

79
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,376
but I'm guessing the shoreline.

80
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,971
One of these caves in here--

81
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,983
that's where we found them
the last time.

82
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,882
It's a tough job.

83
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,716
You need to call in
everybody you've got,

84
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:51,518
including the state highway boys,
and do it yesterday.

85
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,650
I'll handle it.

86
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,594
Will someone tell me
who the hell these people are?

87
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,029
Well, as near
as we could figure it,

88
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,329
they're descendents
of a lighthouse keeper

89
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,599
who went missing
off of Catbird Island back in the 1800s.

90
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,903
Tourism, fishing population

91
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,967
finally flushed
his offspring back to mainland.

92
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,775
Okay, but what I don't get is
how come nobody's seen them?

93
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,077
You do this kind of thing,
you get noticed.

94
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,016
Where have they been hiding
the past 10 years?

95
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,349
Now I thought about that.

96
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,446
I don't think they've been hiding.

97
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,218
I think they've been moving.

98
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,055
Look, we're a spit
in the eye from Canada here

99
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,926
and there's plenty of coastline
all the way up to Newfoundland,

100
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,124
maybe even Hudson Bay.

101
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,395
Some of it is practically deserted.

102
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,698
Now we don't coordinate
our missing persons

103
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,068
with Canada very well, do we?

104
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,903
And I bet they've had
a few over the past few years.

105
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,002
I don't think these people know
they're crossing a border.

106
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,707
I think they just keep moving.

107
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,682
All right. So where
do you want to start?

108
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,815
We find that cave

109
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,789
and hope they're calling it home again.

110
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,826
- Hey.
- Hi.

111
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,355
- You made it.
- Oh, we made it.

112
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,569
- Hey, Luke.
- Hi, Amy.

113
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,335
- Hi, David.
- Leave the bags. Leave the bags.

114
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,501
Let David haul it in.

115
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,738
You guys want something
to drink, I bet.

116
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,609
They-- they found him.

117
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,308
They're serving him
the papers today.

118
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,283
- It's about goddamn time.
- Yup.

119
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,220
Okay, she's hungry.
She's hungry. Okay.

120
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,688
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

121
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,851
Okay.

122
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:38,495
Luke, why don't you go see
what David's up to?

123
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,293
- Okay.
- Okay? Okay.

124
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,999
Oh my God, she's so beautiful.

125
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,840
You look really tired.

126
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,842
You getting any sleep at all?

127
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,777
No, not enough, not lately.

128
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:57,748
The IRS is all over me.

129
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,274
Okay, let me get this straight--

130
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,685
Steven mismanages
his clients' money,

131
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,313
takes out a half-million-dollar loan

132
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,983
to cover his debts at the firm,

133
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,925
puts up your house as collateral,

134
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,520
forges your name to the loan
and the IRS documents,

135
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,224
- and they come after you?
- They couldn't find him.

136
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,723
For 9 months
he disappeared completely.

137
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,794
And it wasn't until
his boss disappeared,

138
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,432
then Christmas
and Luke's birthday came and went

139
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,341
and not a word out of him,

140
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:30,007
which is--
it's completely killing Luke.

141
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,609
He's seen him drunk,
he's seen him abusive

142
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,051
and he still loves his dad.

143
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,518
Anyway, it was a joint return
and me the IRS could find.

144
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,927
So now they're putting up the house
for a quarter of what it's worth.

145
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,363
Ouch.

146
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,991
Was that me or Melissa?

147
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,099
- 138 3/8.
- Pretty good.

148
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,474
Nice local lumber,
right out of the big woods.

149
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,883
Can I?

150
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,883
Sure.

151
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,326
You know how to focus?

152
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,850
No.

153
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,860
Okay, you've got
these 2 images here.

154
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,030
What you want to do is bring the lens

155
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,903
either towards your nose or away

156
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,968
until you get just one image,

157
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,172
then you use this knob

158
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,045
to make it good and clear...

159
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:39,710
like that. Try it.

160
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,852
- Hey!
- Hey.

161
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,861
Why don't you take it
out back through the field?

162
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,329
There's a path to the woods.
You can go hunt your bear.

163
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,696
Oh, but if you get
too close to the sea

164
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,758
and you hear it getting louder,
turn around, okay?

165
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,531
You've gone far enough.

166
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,567
Seems like a nice boy.
Got troubles, though, doesn't he?

167
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,975
That he does.

168
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,845
<i>* Melissa...</i>

169
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,050
So we sell the house,

170
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,389
we're getting $30,000, tops,

171
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,224
- to start a whole new life with.
- Oh my God.

172
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,231
Hi.

173
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,133
Hello.

174
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,006
Wait a minute.

175
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,910
- It's him. It's Stephen.
- What?

176
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,381
He says he's coming up here.
He's on his way right now.

177
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,475
Oh my-- here here
here here here.

178
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,110
Come here,
come here. Okay.

179
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:56,088
- Anything?
- Checked the last cave we know of.

180
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,959
Found nothing.

181
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,294
Shit.

182
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,505
Hey, I'm not a cop
anymore, remember?

183
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,138
My guess is, before this is over
you're gonna join me.

184
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,997
There's nothing I can do.

185
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,795
- He's on the goddamn road already.
- Wait, I don't get it.

186
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,825
He doesn't want
the divorce now?

187
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,393
He said he wants
to talk about it,

188
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,669
and he had that tone--
it was controlled and edgy.

189
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,902
He'd been drinking.

190
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:26,137
Good. Maybe he'll drive
himself into a tree.

191
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,941
Can I talk to you a minute?

192
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,571
I don't want Luke to see him.

193
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,981
Do you know that he still has
Stephen's Christmas present

194
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,816
wrapped in his room?
A tiny little blue ceramic bird

195
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,879
that he made
for him at school.

196
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,221
It's absolutely terrible,
but he made it for Stephen.

197
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,021
What about
the restraining order?

198
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,392
He seems to be choosing
to ignore that, honey.

199
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,422
- The hell he is.
- Who are you calling?

200
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:51,459
Vic Manetti-- the police.

201
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,300
Wait-- wait a minute.
I'm thinking about Luke here.

202
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,535
What about Luke?
Luke saw you backed up

203
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,304
against your
kitchen wall one night

204
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,369
while Stephen worked off his drunk
by slapping you around!

205
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,905
Hello, Gloria.
Hi, is Vic there?

206
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,578
It's David Halbard
up on River Road.

207
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:13,218
Yeah well, we've got kind of
a situation over here.

208
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,452
We've got houseguests--

209
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,518
a friend and an
8-year-old boy.

210
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,428
The woman is going through
a rather messy divorce right now.

211
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,297
She's got a restraining order
against her husband--

212
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,565
yeah, physical violence involved.

213
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,799
He's coming up here
from Connecticut

214
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,740
and he says he's going
to arrive sometime tonight.

215
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:37,010
Well, we don't know what the hell
to do when he gets here.

216
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,849
Carey, C-A-R-E-Y, Stephen.

217
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,721
I'm sorry, what?
What do you mean, do I have a gun?

218
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,384
Are you kidding me, Gloria?

219
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,854
All-- all right.

220
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,558
Uh, okay.

221
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,026
Um, thanks, Gloria.

222
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:04,007
- That was truly strange.
- What?

223
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:08,206
Well, she said Vic and most
of the sheriff's office

224
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,339
are investigating a murder.

225
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:14,148
There's strictly
skeleton staff over there.

226
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,484
And what was
that business about a gun?

227
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,456
Yeah, that's the really weird part.

228
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,858
She actually suggested that
I order him off at gunpoint--

229
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,862
as a matter of fact,

230
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,955
and anybody else who
I didn't personally know

231
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,865
who may or may not
come around here tonight.

232
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,732
What?

233
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,795
Can you see me standing
on the porch with a shotgun

234
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,364
like Elvis in "Flaming Star"?

235
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,603
Look what I've got.

236
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,440
Aren't these cool?

237
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,662
Hi. Throw your pack
in the back. Hop in.

238
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,876
Thanks.
How far are you going?

239
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,905
Oh, some godforsaken place
called Dead River. You?

240
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,715
Portland. Nice car.

241
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,721
Thanks.
What's in Portland?

242
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,223
My boyfriend goes
to school there.

243
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,819
You a student too?

244
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,320
I quit for a year, wanted to work.

245
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,493
I go back in September.

246
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,298
Hey, you know,
I think I know Dead River.

247
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,327
Isn't that up near Lubec,

248
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,239
up near the border?
It's pretty country up there.

249
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,267
Well, I don't know about Lubec,
but it's up there all right.

250
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,439
Damn long drive
from Connecticut.

251
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,949
Why don't you just fly?

252
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,952
I mean, you don't look like
you'd have any trouble affording it,

253
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,817
if you know what I mean.

254
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,286
Listen, maybe you could
help me out.

255
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,399
I really don't know where
the hell I'm going and...

256
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,166
well, I'm hopeless at reading
road signs after dark,

257
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,902
so why don't you ride
shotgun with me?

258
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,139
Get me there

259
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,010
and I'll drive you
over to the airport

260
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,845
at Machias or wherever

261
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:28,080
and put you on a plane
to Portland, my treat.

262
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,610
I'll give you $50
for your troubles.

263
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,481
Dead River's got to be
200 miles up the coast.

264
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,858
It'll be 9:00 or 10:00
before you even get there.

265
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,886
Portland's less than
an hour from here.

266
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,057
So? You look at it
as an adventure.

267
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,397
All right, make it $100.
How's that?

268
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,534
Here...

269
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,436
let me buy you a drink.

270
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,010
What's your name?

271
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:03,249
- Susan.
- That's a nice name, Susie.

272
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,513
Suzy Creamcheese.

273
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,822
Lazy Susan.

274
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,454
Your boyfriend do all the work?

275
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,264
Suzerain. Suzerain means
feudal lord, you know--

276
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,827
one to whom allegiance is due.

277
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,101
Let's see, what else is there?

278
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,906
<i>* "Oh Susanna," Sweet Suzy...</i>

279
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,243
I-- I think I'd like to get out now.

280
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,044
Stop anywhere, okay?

281
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,452
- You want to get out?
- Yes.

282
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,251
Why?

283
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,252
- You're drinking.
- Well, yes, that's true.

284
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,819
I am.

285
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,128
I'm visiting
my son and my wife

286
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,602
if that's your problem.
I'm not coming onto you.

287
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,366
- Okay.
- So what do you say?

288
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:59,340
- About what?
- About driving up with me.

289
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,572
I-- I can't.

290
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:05,014
Okay. Get out.

291
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,085
What? You've gotta pull over!

292
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,453
No, I don't.

293
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,790
So go on, get the fuck out.

294
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:22,333
- I can't!
- You can't.

295
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,102
Throw your pack out.

296
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,712
What?

297
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,582
Throw your pack
out the window

298
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,415
and I'll pull over.

299
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,419
I promise.

300
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,330
Push it.

301
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:31,135
The great city
of Portland welcomes you.

302
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,296
Have a nice day.

303
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:09,294
Bad hunt.

304
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,460
We are cursed.

305
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,991
We eat.

306
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,869
We are cursed.

307
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,874
Baby powerful.

308
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,875
Baby life.

309
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,345
Life release through blood.

310
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,817
Only blood!

311
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,917
Blood give us power.

312
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,153
No blood take our power.

313
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:42,228
Baby die in shit and urine.

314
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:48,169
Ghost of baby angry...

315
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,640
trapped.

316
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:06,217
We take other baby...

317
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,452
new baby.

318
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,922
Release...

319
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,454
not trapped.

320
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,563
Take power!

321
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,773
Second Stolen!

322
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,428
No!
Not punishment.

323
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,441
Hunt.

324
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:39,411
Let's give it up, Vic.
It's too damn dark.

325
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,918
Yeah, might as well call it
a night across the board.

326
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,978
- Go to stage 2.
- House to house.

327
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,753
Tell them to stay indoors,
keep their phone lines open

328
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,726
and doors
and windows locked.

329
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,695
All right. Come on,
let's head back.

330
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,379
I love you, honey.

331
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,009
Good night.

332
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,592
Oh God.

333
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,727
He all settled in up there?

334
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,499
At bedtime everything's drama.

335
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,029
Every night.

336
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,167
He can't find this,
he has to do that

337
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,836
and he's always testing me.

338
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,538
"I love you, Mommy.
I hate you, Mommy."

339
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,844
- I don't know what to do.
- He'll be okay.

340
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,782
I wonder.

341
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:02,491
Amy, the door.
The door!

342
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,660
I'll phone the police.

343
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:05,862
Use the one in our room!

344
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:09,566
And, um, get a blanket
off the bed!

345
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,167
Amy, honey,
can you get me a pot of water?

346
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,977
Are you okay?

347
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,376
Mom? Mom?

348
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,784
Stay inside, close the door
and get your clothes on.

349
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,191
David, there's no dial tone.

350
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:37,429
What?!
Use my cell phone. It's on the--

351
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,368
Oh my God!

352
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,214
Amy! Amy!

353
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,270
Luke, there are people
in this house

354
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,834
and they want to hurt us.
We have to go out the window--

355
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,209
- Mommy--
- It's okay to be scared,

356
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,577
but we have to be brave too.

357
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,048
Let me help you.
Put Melissa down on the bed.

358
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,088
Baby!

359
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,648
It's not as far down
as it seems, I promise.

360
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,320
All right, sweetie,
when you fall

361
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,693
remember to bend
your legs, okay? Oh God.

362
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,909
Mom, are you okay? Mom?

363
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,975
You said we needed
to find a place to hide.

364
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,817
- I know a place.
- Quick, show me. Show me.

365
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,356
Baby!

366
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,823
Woman.

367
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,093
Baby?

368
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,919
What the fuck?

369
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,288
Fucking-- Jesus!

370
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,209
Fuck me!

371
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,067
What you gonna do, Vic?

372
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,339
Oh Jesus,
this is all we need.

373
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,880
Driver, pull the vehicle over.

374
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,980
Sir, place your hands
behind your-- turn around!

375
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,888
Place your hands
behind your head

376
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,358
and turn around.

377
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,162
Check him.
Very good, sir. Thank you.

378
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:05,430
- Just stand still.
- Vic, check this out.

379
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,599
Sir, you can take
your hands down now.

380
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,974
You want to maybe
tell me what happened?

381
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,744
She took out
my fucking window

382
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,082
and he tried to rip
my fucking head off!

383
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,110
- I mean look at this! Look at these!
- Sir, hold on.

384
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,316
What do you mean "he," "she"?
What man and woman?

385
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,723
Kids! Fucking wild animals!

386
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,454
Sir, hold on.
I'm gonna need you to calm down.

387
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,394
Let's just start with your name.
What is your name?

388
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,625
Carey-- Stephen Carey.

389
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,293
All right. Mr. Carey,
where did you just come from?

390
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,859
- Up there.
- I need to know exactly where up there.

391
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,395
I don't know,
some fucking dirt road!

392
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,738
I was gonna visit my wife.

393
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,242
Okay, so your wife lives up there?

394
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,007
No, she was gonna visit friends.

395
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,981
- Who would they be?
- I can't remember their last name.

396
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,677
Why the fuck can't I remember
their last name?!

397
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,277
Sir, calm down.
Why don't you come with us

398
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,550
- and you can show us where you went?
- No way.

399
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,183
No. I don't want
any part of that fucking place.

400
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,352
Did you see
any guns there, sir?

401
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,794
Guns? No. No, no guns.

402
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:09,266
Hatchets and knives
and-- Jesus!

403
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,325
Do you see what
these gentlemen are wearing?

404
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,302
Do you see this?

405
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,329
I think you're gonna be fine, okay?

406
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,337
It's around here somewhere.

407
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,106
You told me once
that people never look up.

408
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,444
Remember? And we can see
the house from here.

409
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,813
We can see if anybody comes.

410
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,012
There!

411
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,080
You been drinking tonight, sir?

412
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:37,321
No. Well, yeah, a little.

413
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,922
Halbard-- that's it,
for God's sake. It's Halbard.

414
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,990
That's David and Amy Halbard.
That's up on River Road.

415
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,095
Gloria?

416
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,264
Gloria, yeah, it's Vic.

417
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,103
I need you to take everybody off
of house-to-house

418
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,473
and get them up
to the Halbard place on River Road.

419
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,502
Get an ambulance up there.

420
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,571
Yeah, Vic, that plate
Miles just called in

421
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,413
is registered to one Stephen Carey,
Greenwich, Connecticut.

422
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,851
Got a call on him earlier
from Dave Halbard,

423
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,048
- something about a restraining order.
- Hey!

424
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,784
Gloria, tell the state boys
he bailed out

425
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,796
about 100 yards
from River Road.

426
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,128
He's heading
for Mayor Beach!

427
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:18,601
Looks like he's going through
the woods towards Mayor Beach.

428
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,968
- Copy that.
- We don't have time for this shit.

429
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,303
Let's go.

430
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,874
- Mom.
- Count them,

431
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,647
see where they go.

432
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,395
It's Amy, Mom.
They've got Amy.

433
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,835
I know. We've got to
keep Melissa safe.

434
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,566
We'll help
as soon as we can.

435
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:58,006
Can't we help her now?
They're hurting her, Mom.

436
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,873
See how many there are.

437
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,115
3, not counting Amy.

438
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,639
Then we can't do it.

439
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,084
Oh God, they're still
all around us somewhere.

440
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,679
- But, Mom--
- We can't.

441
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,713
You know I love Amy. We can't.

442
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,357
Wait. Luke, quickly,

443
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,385
I think we can get
to the car and get help.

444
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,699
Wait here.

445
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:39,176
Luke, come on.

446
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:51,361
Luke, run! I said run!

447
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,657
Baby!

448
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,140
This was a really nice guy.

449
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,076
What did you find up there?

450
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,610
There's a broken door
to the bedroom

451
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,919
and the window was wide open

452
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,926
like someone maybe
got out that way or tried to.

453
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,021
- Did you see the bassinet?
- Bassinet?

454
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:04,125
- In that room.
- Christ on a crutch,

455
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:05,760
we've got another baby here?

456
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:09,332
What the hell was that?

457
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,636
<i>* I'm Stephen Carey</i>

458
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,081
<i>* Go under the tree</i>

459
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,642
<i>* I'm gonna put you, Claire</i>

460
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:25,018
<i>* Right down on your knees</i>

461
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:28,616
- Right down on your knees
- Steal him later.

462
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,650
<i>* 'Cause I know what--</i>

463
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,944
I think it was coming
from right around here.

464
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,079
Hey!

465
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:58,572
No! No! Get off of me!

466
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,977
No!

467
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:06,915
No! No!

468
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,043
No!

469
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,728
You'll be all right here.

470
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,957
I'll come back for you.

471
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,590
You'll see.

472
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,080
You fucking crazy bitch.

473
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:21,407
You stay the fuck away from me!

474
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:24,552
You stay the fuck away from me!

475
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,383
No!

476
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,483
Get off of me!

477
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:37,357
You little fuckers.

478
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:14,156
So you got one of them, Vic?

479
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,247
Fuck it. That'll have to do.

480
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,746
Let her down.

481
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,110
Let her down!

482
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:34,904
No. No. No!

483
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:48,066
Oh. God damn.

484
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,672
Baby?

485
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,250
Rabbit?

486
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:42,422
Find Rabbit.

487
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,933
Eartheater dead.

488
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:48,164
Find Rabbit.

489
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,018
Wait.

490
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,128
Stephen?

491
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,038
St-Stephen?

492
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,809
Shut the fuck up, Claire.

493
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,357
Oh, Jesus.

494
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:17,557
No. No!

495
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,750
Baby. Baby!

496
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,529
Baby.

497
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:02,398
I don't know. I don't know.

498
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,801
But I think I know
where you can find out.

499
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:12,578
She doesn't like

500
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:14,606
to be bitten.

501
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,093
Please don't.

502
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,859
No no, please don't.

503
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,539
I don't know.
I swear I don't know.

504
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:14,034
The truth, Claire.

505
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,803
Go on, tell her.

506
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,752
All right-- the house.

507
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,450
I told Luke to go back
to the house in case anything--

508
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,288
if anything ever happened to me

509
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,453
to take Melissa and go back
to the house right away.

510
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:37,058
I think you'd better find some way
of making her understand

511
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,762
what the fuck
you're talking about.

512
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,793
Don't you?

513
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,745
No. No!

514
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,586
No, get off of me!

515
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,592
No!

516
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:05,287
No, get off of me!

517
01:01:06,228 --> 01:01:07,888
No!

518
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:12,492
No! No, get off of me!

519
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:12,889
Oh my God. No. No.

520
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,126
No! No.

521
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:21,028
Get off of me! No!

522
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,604
No!

523
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,034
Baby?

524
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,374
Oh my God!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

525
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,380
No!

526
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,178
Oh my God!

527
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,917
Over here.

528
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:49,958
Are you okay?

529
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,126
Where are they?

530
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,897
Who's with them?

531
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,342
My-- my mom and Amy.

532
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:04,812
- I think-- I think Amy.
- Who's Amy?

533
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:07,008
My mom's friend--
Mrs. Halbard.

534
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:10,041
You saw them?
What, you followed them?

535
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:12,247
And I think--

536
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,313
I think I saw my father.

537
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:15,881
It was later.

538
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:18,860
He-- there was this man
with this woman.

539
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:21,625
He was leaning on her
and they were going up.

540
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,132
- She-- she--
- Easy, son.

541
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,897
You did good. Now listen.

542
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,904
I gotta go up there,

543
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:31,566
but I want you to stay
right here out of sight

544
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,131
and watch for me.

545
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:35,804
You stay right here
hidden in the grass, okay?

546
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,541
If anybody comes along
who doesn't look right to you,

547
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,549
you stay right where you are.

548
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,551
You don't need to warn me.

549
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,611
You don't need to do
anything but hide, okay?

550
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,282
I'll be fine.

551
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:50,190
If anybody comes along
who looks like a policeman,

552
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:53,195
you show them
where I've gotten to.

553
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,857
And we're gonna get
everybody out of there

554
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:57,559
in good shape, okay?

555
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,329
Now we just met,

556
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:04,168
but I've got a feeling
you're a pretty brave guy,

557
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:07,904
so you hang in there
and watch for those uniforms.

558
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:11,436
And I'll be seeing you, okay?

559
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,778
Now go on, get down.

560
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,716
Spread out!

561
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,296
Hello?

562
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,975
No, get off of me!

563
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,640
Oh my God, No!

564
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,512
No no no...

565
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,212
No! Oh my God!

566
01:04:56,225 --> 01:05:00,127
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

567
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,369
Get off me!

568
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,340
Stop it!

569
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:17,109
Stop it!

570
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,617
Get the fuck away from me!

571
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,394
What are you fucking doing?
They'll kill us, you dumb bitch!

572
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,660
Kill us?
They'll kill us anyway!

573
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,224
Didn't you see what they did
to your fucking wife,

574
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,704
- you stupid piece of shit?!
- You mean that? Fuck her.

575
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:46,071
Don't. Don't!

576
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:50,038
Don't leave me!

577
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,706
Stay where you are!

578
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,527
It's over.

579
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:21,661
We've got to get out of here.

580
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,969
We've got to find someone.
Come on.

581
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,792
- Mommy!
- Luke!

582
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,878
We need another stretcher here.

583
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,787
Yeah, I know exactly where she is.

584
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:11,259
- Where?
- I'd have to show you.

585
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:13,989
It's too dangerous, son.
You don't even know what's out there.

586
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,190
I don't know how to tell you.

587
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,994
It's just this place off the path.

588
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,228
I need to show you.

589
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,203
Ma'am?

590
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,832
Melissa?

591
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:27,705
Melissa?

592
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,606
You be careful, okay?

593
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,166
- There!
- Son, hold on!

594
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,828
- Wait up, kid!
- Stop!

595
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,461
Slow down!

596
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,972
- Luke, stop!
- Luke, wait!

597
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,236
Luke, stop!

598
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,674
Luke!

599
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:29,163
- Luke!
- Luke!

600
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,800
Subtitles: Arigon

601
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:58,160
Holy shit! Who is that?

602
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,829
That's not Luke.
Luke, are you all right up there?

603
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,838
Is the baby okay?

604
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:30,263
It's okay, Melissa.

605
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,925
We're safe now.
