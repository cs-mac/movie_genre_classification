1
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,118
She's much better now, Jeff.

2
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,454
- I was scared to
death when I brought her in.

3
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,665
Thank God it's all over.

4
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,785
Guess, I should thank you, Doctor.

5
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,912
- She still needs
a lot of understanding

6
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,380
and love and, of course, time.

7
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,504
She's cured, isn't she?

8
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,222
- Well, that's a word
psychiatry doesn't throw around

9
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,807
the way we used to.

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,645
Cynthia may feel there are
still some things she needs

11
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,855
to take care of by herself.

12
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,275
But right now, being home
with you will do more good

13
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,940
than any psychiatrist.

14
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,359
- I'm thinking of taking
her on a little trip

15
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,651
back to the islands.

16
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:18,368
We had our honeymoon
there, and she loved it.

17
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,529
Sounds fine.

18
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,157
Try and keep her around people
she feels comfortable with.

19
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,126
We both want another baby, Doctor.

20
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,043
Cynthia.

21
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,966
You look good.

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,836
Thanks, I feel good.

23
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,523
- Okay, okay,
okay, who has the table?

24
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,992
Come on you guys, let's move it.

25
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:00,826
Sorry.

26
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,695
- Come on, girls.
- Are you all right?

27
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,288
I guess so.

28
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,873
- Here.
- All right.

29
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,663
- There you go.
- Here, you take this.

30
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,500
What the hell is this?

31
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,619
Need a beer.

32
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,796
Okay, who gets the cooler?

33
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,711
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,007
Oh, don't tell me we're going in that.

35
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,177
Give us a hand, would you?

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,939
- Hey, you gonna fly
this thing, Lindbergh?

37
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,859
No, I'm gonna fly it.

38
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,573
- Oh, you're gonna fly it.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,952
Here's the beer.

40
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,194
Paul, grab that line up there, will you?

41
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,589
It's gonna take me a
while to fix this thing.

42
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,423
Paul?

43
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,382
Yeah.

44
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,547
- Why don't you find a
place we can pitch a tent?

45
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,262
We'll probably be here for the night.

46
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,051
Okay.

47
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,306
Wanna help get the gear unloaded?

48
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,809
Give him a hand, Rob.

49
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,790
Paul, you want some coffee?

50
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,754
Hey, campers.

51
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,969
Hi.

52
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,838
I got coffee.

53
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,931
Oh, yeah, you got some good stuff there.

54
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,618
What's up?

55
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,081
I just can't figure it out.

56
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,206
There's power there, but the
instruments won't respond.

57
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,134
There's nothing I can do
now until the morning.

58
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,001
That's all right, gang.

59
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,755
We'll just stay here instead
of Jackson Island, right?

60
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,597
Yeah, well, where the hell is here?

61
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,717
I'd like to know I could get off one day.

62
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,391
- It's okay, I've packed
enough food to last weeks.

63
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,517
- Yeah, well, I'd still like
to know when I could get off.

64
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,735
Honey, honey, honey, don't worry.

65
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,194
We'll get you off.

66
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:16,990
Yeah!

67
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,909
Music, all right.

68
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,373
Woods are woods.

69
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,038
Come on, gang, it ain't that bad is it?

70
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,504
Woods are woods.

71
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,588
Come on, gang.

72
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,559
You're nuts, man.

73
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,173
Well, guys, I'm gonna go scuba diving.

74
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,341
Who wants to come?

75
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,385
No, I'm gonna take a look around.

76
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,508
Paul, you coming?

77
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,804
Forget it, honey.

78
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,019
I gotta sleep it off, okay?

79
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,059
You wanna go, Rob?

80
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,858
I only dive for muff, sweetheart.

81
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,982
You catch it, I'll cook it.

82
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,948
All right.

83
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,694
Cynth, you wanna go?

84
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,287
Cynth, you wanna go?

85
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:53,916
Sure.

86
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,346
How's it going?

87
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:02,883
Not good.

88
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,428
Electrical burnout.

89
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,020
Radio's out.

90
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,480
Nothing's workin'.

91
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,076
Stay right there.

92
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,116
You be good, you be good.

93
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,462
Cynthia?

94
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,251
Jeff?

95
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,605
Oh, can you hang on a second?

96
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,398
Hang on.

97
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,071
Hey, Cynthia.

98
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,127
Why the hell didn't you help her?

99
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:53,960
She could've drowned.

100
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,749
No!

101
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,210
No!

102
00:11:58,885 --> 00:11:59,750
She's dead.

103
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,211
It's my fault.

104
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,797
It's my fault!

105
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,891
No, Cynthia, she's okay.

106
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,725
I'm okay.

107
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,345
She's all right, Terri's all right.

108
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,642
She's all right.

109
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,732
Come on, come on.

110
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,851
Water in the wrong tube.

111
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,647
It's okay.

112
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,399
She's okay.

113
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:08,986
Are you crazy?

114
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,989
Don't ever do that again.

115
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,535
Hey, lighten up.

116
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,283
- Something moved in
those bushes back there.

117
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,456
Right over there.

118
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,169
Scared the hell out of me.

119
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,333
Probably a deer.

120
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,206
Some kinda little animal.

121
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,628
Maybe even a bird.

122
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,092
I wanna go back.

123
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,687
Hi, guys.

124
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,065
What happened?

125
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,569
- Terri fell off the
rocks and into the water.

126
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,410
She's okay.

127
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,826
Just shook up a little bit, that's all.

128
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,619
Yeah, I'm all right.

129
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,288
- So what's the situation
with the plane, Jeff?

130
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,506
I can't fix it.

131
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,501
I think we better check out this island,

132
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,878
see what we can find.

133
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:08,800
Oh, great.

134
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,890
- Paul, you stay here and
keep an eye on the plane

135
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,350
until we get back.

136
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,560
All right.

137
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,589
Hey, you guys, look at this.

138
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,134
Come on.

139
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,198
Oh boy, this looks like fun.

140
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,165
Think anyone lives here?

141
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,078
Gives me the creeps.

142
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,295
Anybody home?

143
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,085
Hello?

144
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,418
Maybe there's a phone inside.

145
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,214
Wanna try?

146
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:26,688
Oh my God.

147
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,783
- Geez, it's like we just
walked into the 1920s.

148
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,203
Look at this place.

149
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,449
Hey, look at this.

150
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,038
My grandfather had one of these.

151
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,916
I used to listen to it all the time.

152
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,462
You think it works?

153
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,467
All right.

154
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,299
Hey, toots, you're the cat's pajamas.

155
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,221
What's say we cut a rug?

156
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,846
Thought you'd never ask.

157
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,394
Al Jolson eat your heart out.

158
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,189
Oh, wow.

159
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,907
Hey you, guys, look at this dress.

160
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,866
- Wow.
- Mary Pickford wore one

161
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,282
just like it in Little Annie Rooney.

162
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,996
- That's neat.
- Look what I found.

163
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,868
One for you, one for me,
and now we're cookin'.

164
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,376
Oh no, this is me.

165
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,420
What do you think, huh?

166
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,382
All right.

167
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,304
Now we're cookin'.

168
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,764
Oh yeah?

169
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,639
Take me home.

170
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,400
Color coordinated.

171
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,110
All right.

172
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,658
Don't tape this.

173
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:22,970
Oh yeah?

174
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,487
Is that right?

175
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:37,917
- Hey, you guys, I think
we better take it easy, huh?

176
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,385
That's all right, children.

177
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:44,507
Been meanin' to get rid
of them old things anyhow.

178
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,572
We're sorry.

179
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,699
We kinda messed things up.

180
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,081
We'll pay for anything that's broken.

181
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:18,253
- Say, young man, that
scarf suits you real well.

182
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,720
I have a good mind to give
you one for your very own.

183
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,261
Well, thanks, it's really very nice.

184
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,135
Knitted 'em all myself, you know.

185
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,564
- Like I was saying, we're
really sorry for the mess,

186
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,604
and if you'd let us pay...

187
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:42,030
- Oh, now, now, that's
nothin' to make a fuss over.

188
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,945
You was just havin' some fun, that's all.

189
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:49,162
Don't cry over spilled
milk is what I always say.

190
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,408
- You haven't old us
where you folks came from.

191
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,125
From Seattle, sir.

192
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,289
We had trouble with our plane.

193
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,754
We had to put it on the beach.

194
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,668
Do you have a phone we could use?

195
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,544
Or any gas you could spare?

196
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:08,595
I don't believe in those contraptions.

197
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,435
However, I got a friend's
comin' around tomorrow morning.

198
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,554
Maybe he can do somethin'.

199
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,019
This the whole passle of ya?

200
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:17,812
Yeah.

201
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,314
Yeah, this is it.

202
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,154
My name's Jeff, and this is Terri.

203
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,196
Hi.

204
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,536
And Rob and Lynn.

205
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,825
And there's Paul, he's
back with the plane.

206
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,824
And Cynthia.

207
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,620
Oh yeah.

208
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,869
Where is she, anyway?

209
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,459
She's down there.

210
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,756
Down the stairs.

211
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,362
Oh God, Jeff, don't do that.

212
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,986
- Take it easy.
- You scared me.

213
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,612
Come on upstairs.

214
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,535
The people that live here just walked in.

215
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,784
Have you seen this room?

216
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:17,625
It's incredible.

217
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,459
It's a child's room,

218
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,124
but everything in it's about 50 years old.

219
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,588
Yeah, it's weird, all right.

220
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,004
I'd say they're a little
on the eccentric side.

221
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,796
Yeah.

222
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,465
Come on, they're waitin' for us.

223
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,258
Okay.

224
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,486
Hey, this looks great, Ma.

225
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,480
I'm glad you like it.

226
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,822
Don't you guys have any real names,

227
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,158
like Jones or somethin'?

228
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,698
Ma and Pa suits us just fine.

229
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:58,163
We don't set much store
by fancy manners up here.

230
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:01,082
Child.

231
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,762
Lord, we thank thee for the blessings

232
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:16,392
we are about to receive and
the food upon this table.

233
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:21,231
And we pray in the future
they will be the same,

234
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,941
that thou will bless the table.

235
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:28,063
And we eat now in the name
of Jesus Christ our Lord.

236
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:29,902
Amen.

237
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,448
Amen.

238
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,617
Amen.

239
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,259
- Young lady, I can't abide
the wastin' of good food.

240
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,553
Now, let's see you wipe the platter clean

241
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,227
like your friends done.

242
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:07,398
Don't you want to be in
the clean plate club?

243
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,235
Clean plate club?

244
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,448
I need a drink.

245
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,991
- You know, this is a real
nice place you have here,

246
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,539
but don't you miss not having electricity

247
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,662
and television and things?

248
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,590
Ma, do me a favor.

249
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,551
Let me have some whipped potatoes.

250
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,760
Why sure, Pa.

251
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,065
- Do you guys have a radio
or anything like that?

252
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,685
Must be hard to keep up with the news.

253
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,733
Did you know they sent an
exploratory rocket to Mars?

254
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,775
It's gonna be there in a couple weeks,

255
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:52,738
and then they're gonna...

256
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,234
- Young man, if you keep
tellin' stories like that,

257
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:00,285
your nose is gonna grow
longer than a broomstick.

258
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,840
Stories?

259
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,584
That's not a story.

260
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,803
You know, they've landed on the moon.

261
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,093
Pa, think it's gonna rain?

262
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,350
I don't know.

263
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,308
It was a little misty,

264
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,770
but I think it'll clear up before evenin'.

265
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,066
How 'bout you, Lynn?

266
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,651
Think it'll rain.

267
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,986
Rain, I don't know.

268
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,196
Who cares?

269
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,405
Just a minute, young lady.

270
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:37,151
There's no smokin' in this house.

271
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:38,823
Nice young lady don't smoke.

272
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,492
If you're a victim of tobacco,

273
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,617
then take your vice
and indulge it outside.

274
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,413
Fine.

275
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,966
Well, if everyone's done, I'll clean up.

276
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,510
Bad girl.

277
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,018
Now, now, you leave that to me.

278
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,773
Oh, there's nothin' down there

279
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:19,367
that would interest you, child.

280
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,908
In fact, I should've
locked it up long ago.

281
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:30,545
- That goes to the cellar,
and them steps is very steep.

282
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,461
Besides, it's cold as
the grave down there.

283
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,130
That's cold.

284
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:40,255
Better have one of Ma's scarves
before you go down there.

285
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,861
- You go on back to your
dancin' if you like.

286
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,982
I just love to watch young
folk doin' the new steps.

287
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,949
You know the Charleston?

288
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,626
Well, you're welcome to spend the night.

289
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,879
Hi.

290
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,926
It's gorgeous isn't it?

291
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,221
What's happening in there?

292
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,938
Ma's making coffee.

293
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,810
Hey, look at that.

294
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,234
A child's skipping rope.

295
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,447
That's weird.

296
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,985
You know that room I
went down into before?

297
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,203
Yeah.

298
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,993
That was full of kids' toys too.

299
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,379
Hey, that's Mary Pickford.

300
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,168
Yeah.

301
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,672
There's that cradle I told you about.

302
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,640
Please don't wake my baby.

303
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,191
Hello.

304
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,444
My name's Fanny, what's yours?

305
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,319
I'm Lynn.

306
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,329
This is Cynthia.

307
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,119
Hello.

308
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:36,418
My baby's been very ill,
and she needs her rest.

309
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,540
Oh, well, hope she gets better.

310
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:43,386
- Oh, she's all better now,
but she's still quite tired.

311
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,380
Ma says it's important for little girls

312
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,177
to get their 40 winks.

313
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:52,638
I go to bed every night at
nine o'clock, except sometimes

314
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,688
Pa let's me stay up late
to play with my dollies.

315
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:01,108
- There'll be no dollies
for you tonight, young lady.

316
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,026
Time you got ready for bed.

317
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,490
Yes, Ma.

318
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,494
Has Fanny been a good girl,

319
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,910
or has she been sassin' anybody?

320
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,124
No, she's been just fine.

321
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,375
Good.

322
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,247
Well, she's got a birthday comin' up.

323
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:21,170
Guess you can always count
on a youngin' to behave

324
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,634
when party time rolls around.

325
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:27,927
- I'm gonna be 12, and I'm
gonna have a birthday party.

326
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:32,143
- Yep, and if you're
really, really good, well,

327
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,933
you might just get a brand new dolly.

328
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,896
Oh, goody.

329
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,110
Now, that's enough chattering.

330
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,989
Bye, Miss Lynn, Miss Cynthia.

331
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,251
Land sakes, that child can be a caution.

332
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:01,589
As the saying goes, when she's
good, she's very, very good.

333
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,548
But when she's bad...

334
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,919
She's gotta be at least 50.

335
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,384
Don't you think so, Cynthia?

336
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,805
- Wait a minute, she
thinks she's gonna be 12?

337
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,020
- Yeah, she's gonna have a
birthday party any day now.

338
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,060
And she plays with dollies.

339
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,353
We got some really looney toons here.

340
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,317
Oh, she's a real goon, all right.

341
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,064
Her clothes are like something
out of Little Orphan Annie.

342
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,939
This is just too much.

343
00:30:58,774 --> 00:30:59,560
Come on.

344
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,686
Fanny's been hidin' all day.

345
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,986
Shy as the dickens with new folks.

346
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,530
But she is to say good night.

347
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,277
Oh yes, let me see.

348
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,406
That's Jeff, and that's Rob and Terri.

349
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,744
And you already met up with the girls.

350
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,625
Well, say good night, and
then off to bed with ya.

351
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,842
Nighty night.

352
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,935
What are you doing?

353
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,601
- Just turning off the
lights so you young folks

354
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,348
can get some sleep.

355
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,316
It's only 8:30.

356
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,027
- Now, you're not so growed
up that you don't need

357
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,146
your 40 winks.

358
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,942
Okay, where do we sleep?

359
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,115
Just a second.

360
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,868
You hitched?

361
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,739
Huh?

362
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,161
Hitched, hitched, hitched.

363
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,625
Hiched means married.

364
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,460
That's what it means.

365
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,419
- Nope.
- Well then,

366
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,709
where do you think you're goin'?

367
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,206
Goin' to bed, get our 40 winks.

368
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,209
No, you're not.

369
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:13,429
There will be no devil's
play in this house.

370
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,424
Aw, for Christ's sake.

371
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,927
There'll be no cussin' and no buts.

372
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,601
Now, you young ladies
are gonna sleep in there.

373
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,815
And you boys stay out here.

374
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,368
Great.

375
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,237
Terri, are you awake?

376
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,537
Hm?

377
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:28,037
I hear noises coming from Fanny's room.

378
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:28,834
Listen.

379
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,469
I want to get out of here.

380
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:39,182
- Don't worry, we'll be
out of here tomorrow.

381
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,262
Check out Ma's PJs.

382
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,228
Listen, why don't you
try and get some sleep?

383
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,821
Oh, and don't forget.

384
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,155
Not 20 winks.

385
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,694
Not 30 winks, but...

386
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,908
But 40 winks.

387
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,447
What are you doin'?

388
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,368
Sorry, go back to sleep.

389
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,240
It's early.

390
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,163
Where you goin'?

391
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,787
Just for a walk, get some air.

392
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,086
Rob.

393
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,671
Hi, Rob, hi.

394
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,630
Hi, Fanny.

395
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,884
What you doin' up so early, Rob?

396
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,879
Nothin' much, just walkin' around.

397
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,380
Who's your friend?

398
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,928
He's not my friend, he's my brother.

399
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,177
Name's Woody, like President Wilson.

400
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,724
That's a nice name.

401
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,687
Hiya, Woody.

402
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,235
Say hello, Woody.

403
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,523
Hello.

404
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,989
Wanna ride in our swing?

405
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,857
Do ya, Rob?

406
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,697
Sure, why not?

407
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,036
Oh boy.

408
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,191
Hey, this is, this is great, guys.

409
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,408
But okay, guys.

410
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,913
Okay, Fanny, that's high enough, okay?

411
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,750
- Not yet, Rob, you
can go higher than that.

412
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,914
I'm high enough, Fanny.

413
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,129
God damn it, I wanna come down now, okay?

414
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,679
Come on, I'm not messin' around.

415
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,139
I wanna come down!

416
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,348
God damn it, I wanna come down!

417
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,270
I wanna come down, god damn it!

418
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,943
What the hell are you doin'?

419
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,735
Oh my God!

420
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,317
Oh my God!

421
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,983
Hi there, had your breakfast yet?

422
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,818
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah.

423
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,028
Your friend come yet?

424
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,522
The what?

425
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,773
- You said your friend
was coming in a boat.

426
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:06,865
Oh, yeah.

427
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,780
Oh, I'm sorry, forgot all about him.

428
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,153
Yeah, he's comin' around.

429
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:14,328
He says, you know, I mean, if he makes it.

430
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,872
What do you mean if?

431
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,369
You mean he might not show up?

432
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,245
Well, I mean there's two kinds of if.

433
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,373
I mean if he shows up, that's a good if.

434
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,217
If he don't show up, that's a bad if.

435
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,552
You gotta have patience, son.

436
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,262
You should learn to read the good book.

437
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,801
He who waits, gets.

438
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,124
Come on, let's go find Cynthia.

439
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,697
Poor child's asleep.

440
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:20,082
Who'd have thought that boy
would find the old swing?

441
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,043
Kids ain't used that in a dog's age.

442
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:25,542
Kids?

443
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:31,043
What's for lunch, Ma?

444
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,431
Take off your hat, Woody,

445
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,801
and introduce yourself to the guests.

446
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,144
Hi, I'm Woody, who are you?

447
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,982
Well, this is Lynn, Cynthia, and Jeff.

448
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,692
They're gonna stay with us for a spell.

449
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,028
Oh, and there's another
girl in the back room,

450
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,738
but don't you bother her none.

451
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,232
Right.

452
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,986
And Rob's the one in the woodshed.

453
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:01,411
Poor soul had an accident
playing on that old swing

454
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,874
out by the cliff.

455
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,210
- We ain't never supposed
to go on those old swings

456
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,000
because they're terrible dangerous.

457
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:11,125
Pa would give us an awful
hiding if we did, right Ma?

458
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,711
Right, right, Woody.

459
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:18,466
Now, you go find your sister,
Fanny, and be a good boy.

460
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,433
And don't bother nobody.

461
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,223
And stay away from the woodshed.

462
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,099
Yeah, Ma.

463
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,524
I'm gonna fix us something nice to eat.

464
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,113
Fivesies.

465
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,539
- Hope that guy with
the boat shows up soon.

466
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,877
Me too.

467
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,371
- Yeah, I keep wondering
what's gonna crawl out

468
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,338
of the woodworks next.

469
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,924
First that Fanny, now Woody.

470
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,340
What a bunch of freaks.

471
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,554
Can you believe this family?

472
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,718
Because I can't.

473
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,263
I mean, they're out to lunch.

474
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,977
And that Fanny, with that ridiculous bow

475
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,597
in her hair and those clothes.

476
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:51,351
And that bloated, ugly, ugly face.

477
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,195
She's absolutely repulsive.

478
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,280
Well, I'm going back in, you comin'?

479
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,778
No, not yet.

480
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:03,575
Okay.

481
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,835
Hello.

482
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,134
Oh, were you listening to that?

483
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,926
Yeah.

484
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,315
You really mustn't pay any attention.

485
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,405
She gets kinda nasty sometimes,

486
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,445
but she doesn't really mean anything.

487
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,448
Gee, that's an awfully
nice dress you've got on.

488
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,620
Did your mom make that for you?

489
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,415
Uh huh, she makes all my clothes

490
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,540
and my baby's clothes too.

491
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,631
Baby.

492
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:01,716
Uh huh.

493
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,308
I have to go now.

494
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,223
Stay and play with me Cynthia.

495
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,438
We make awful good friends.

496
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,602
No.

497
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,602
Please, just a couple little games.

498
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,610
Wait there.

499
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,758
I'll throw first.

500
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:51,975
I did it.

501
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,702
Did I scare you, Cynthia?

502
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,579
No.

503
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,620
Shh, come to my room.

504
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,833
I want you to see my baby.

505
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:28,303
I can tell that you like little babies.

506
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,550
You ain't like the others,

507
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,270
always laughin' and
whisperin' about us kids.

508
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,439
Come look.

509
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,279
Oh no.

510
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,619
Teddy, Cynthia's my friend.

511
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,377
That's my other brother, Teddy.

512
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,296
You wanna hold her, Cyn?

513
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,092
No.

514
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,511
No, no.

515
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,519
Kiss her good night?

516
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,859
Shh, maybe we better take
Cynthia back to her room.

517
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,240
Hi, Miss Lynn, what you doin'?

518
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,626
Just walkin'.

519
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,712
Oh, you haven't met my brother Teddy.

520
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,549
No, but Cynthia told us all about him.

521
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,632
I'll see you guys later.

522
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,924
Hey, what she tell you about me?

523
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,138
Now, Teddy, you behave.

524
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,885
- Yeah, well, I just
don't like nobody sayin'

525
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,433
no bad things about me.

526
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,056
- Maybe she feels bad because
her friend got killed.

527
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:44,435
- Aw, whenever I feel
sad, I just jump rope,

528
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:47,859
and then I feel all better, don't I Teddy?

529
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,027
Yeah.

530
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,156
Why don't you jump rope with us?

531
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,870
I don't wanna jump rope.

532
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,614
I just wanna be left alone.

533
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,366
Oh please jump rope with us, Miss Lynn.

534
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,118
Pretty please.

535
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,586
Pretty please with a cherry on top.

536
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,672
Don't you freaks understand English?

537
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,006
Leave me alone!

538
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,625
Pretty please with a cherry on top

539
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,094
and whipped cream and bananas.

540
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,846
Enough, weirdo!

541
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,307
You're all a bunch of weirdos!

542
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:39,289
- For Christ sakes, Pa, is
your friend comin' or not?

543
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,870
You know, you keep yellin' like that,

544
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,460
you're gonna have that
little girl cryin' again.

545
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,921
- We can't just leave Rob
lyin' there in the woodshed.

546
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,132
Well, have you any other suggestion?

547
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:52,253
Is this guy gonna show up today?

548
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,346
There's a chance he'll show up, yes.

549
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,213
Bullshit.

550
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:56,965
Bullshit?

551
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,054
You listen to me.

552
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:06,771
You never say bullshit,
don't you understand that?

553
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:11,317
Never do that, or God
will send an angel down

554
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,031
to wash out your mouth with soap.

555
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,670
Where's Cynthia?

556
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,793
In the bedroom.

557
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,919
And Lynn?

558
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:34,965
She went out.

559
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,338
Well, go find her.

560
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,555
We're gettin' out of here.

561
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,266
The guy with the boat's
never gonna show up.

562
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,636
Get back to the camp with Paul.

563
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,228
Tell him to get that flare gun ready

564
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,268
in case we have to shoot
off a distress signal.

565
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,607
- Okay.
- I'm gonna go get Cyn.

566
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,272
We'll meet up with you there.

567
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,109
Come on, move it.

568
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:50,898
Okay.

569
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:56,862
Cyn?

570
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,611
We're movin' out.

571
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,120
Cyn?

572
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,543
- You don't believe what I
told you about last night,

573
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,506
do you Jeff?

574
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:18,672
- Look, I know you're shook up,
and that you met this Teddy,

575
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,889
but a mummified baby?

576
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,512
Jeff, I saw it.

577
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,480
I swear to God I saw it.

578
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:31,693
I went down there to Fanny's room.

579
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,357
I saw the cradle.

580
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,071
There's no baby.

581
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,191
Jeff, I know what I saw.

582
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,620
Okay, then what happened?

583
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,288
I don't remember.

584
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,793
I woke up in here this morning.

585
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,589
It wasn't a dream, it was real.

586
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,052
She had the baby in her arms,

587
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,517
and then she held it out to me to kiss it.

588
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,777
It's been a year since the accident.

589
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,860
It's over now.

590
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,948
It wasn't your fault.

591
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,871
You gotta stop torturing yourself.

592
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,063
You leave me alone.

593
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,817
Pa would whoop me bloody like
he did before when you...

594
00:51:58,824 --> 00:51:59,610
Shut up.

595
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,026
I don't want you.

596
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,579
I don't need Woody neither.

597
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,291
I want Jeff.

598
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:36,935
I want him.

599
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,873
Stop, oh God!

600
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:53,664
Ma, Ma.

601
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,001
- Wicked.
- Fanny's gone crazy.

602
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,464
Wicked girl.

603
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,457
You're all wicked.

604
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,755
Come from your wicked world.

605
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,555
As the good book says, the
wicked shall be punished.

606
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,242
That child never does finish a chore.

607
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:36,874
Paul!

608
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:40,503
Paul!

609
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,001
It's gone.

610
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,019
Oh God, it's you, Cynthia.

611
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:20,811
Oh God.

612
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,732
- Jeff's dead.
- What?

613
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,730
Fanny killed him.

614
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,824
And Ma just sat there rocking and smiling.

615
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,944
And they killed Lynn too.

616
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,070
Stop it.

617
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,697
Listen to me, the plane is gone.

618
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,001
Paul is missing, I can't find him.

619
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,244
They're gonna kill us all if we don't...

620
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,462
Listen to me!

621
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,922
- If we don't get...
- Stop it!

622
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,220
- You're it, and ain't none
of you never gonna get off

623
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,933
this island alive.

624
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:58,770
My Ma and Pa will see to that.

625
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,888
Hold it.

626
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,514
Hold it right there.

627
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,576
You're it!

628
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:45,517
There's gotta be a boat on this island.

629
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,811
There's gotta be!

630
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:49,525
Cynthia!

631
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,570
Cynthia!

632
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,904
Where are you?

633
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:02,913
Cynthia!

634
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,664
Where are you?

635
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,975
Oh, please don't hurt my baby.

636
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:24,097
- Let's go, Fanny, you're
gonna get us off this island.

637
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:30,858
Come on.

638
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,574
Come on, Fanny.

639
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,865
Ma, Pa, get out here!

640
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,449
Damn you, I know you can hear me!

641
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,496
Get out here!

642
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:53,425
No, no, wait a minute now.

643
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,215
Wait a minute, please.

644
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:57,588
Don't hurt her.

645
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,182
Don't hurt her my little girl.

646
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,302
- If you want your
little child in one piece

647
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,271
then you better show us where a boat is.

648
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,889
Now!

649
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,357
Pa, Ma, help me.

650
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:13,279
Oh Lordy, don't fret, child.

651
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,027
I'm scared, Ma.

652
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:16,865
Shut up!

653
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,734
Shut up or I'll blow
your god damn head off!

654
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,906
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

655
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:20,869
No, no, listen.

656
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,408
No, don't do anything.

657
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,282
Don't do anything like that.

658
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,624
Please listen to me.

659
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,584
I think I know where there's a boat.

660
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,670
It's on the other side of the island.

661
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,039
It's a fisherman's boat.

662
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,257
Now, I don't know what shape it's in.

663
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,547
You know, I don't know anything about it.

664
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,217
I don't even know if
it's got gasoline in it.

665
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:42,342
- Then you better get goin',
Pa, and show us where it is.

666
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,393
Tell 'em to come out.

667
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,556
Tell who?

668
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,895
You know who I'm talking about.

669
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,605
Tell 'em to come out!

670
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,064
Teddy, Woody, come on out.

671
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,740
Don't you move, you bastards!

672
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,790
Cyn, Cyn, try and start the boat.

673
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:49,621
Come on.

674
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,844
- Now, listen, please don't
do anything to my baby.

675
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,053
Please don't.

676
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,467
I fulfilled my promise.

677
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:04,181
I brought you to the boat.

678
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,972
There's the boat right over there.

679
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,916
Run, run!

680
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,504
Cynthia, run!

681
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,304
Should we go get 'em, Pa?

682
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,393
Nah, let 'em go.

683
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:50,603
Don't worry about 'em.

684
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:54,064
If they're on this island, we'll find 'em.

685
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,730
We know every inch of
it, don't worry about it.

686
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:00,946
- Can we play our game
now, Ma, like you promised?

687
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:03,066
Course you can, sweetie.

688
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,122
You boys, don't you be
late for supper now.

689
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,624
Finally got 'em all to bed.

690
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:36,993
Whew, what a day.

691
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:41,839
How you feel, Ma?

692
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,798
Aw, I'm all right, Pa.

693
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:48,379
All that ruckus today
got me thinkin' back.

694
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,387
Yeah, well, I been thinkin' too.

695
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,350
I been doin' a lot of thinkin'.

696
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:03,103
I been thinkin' that
if some soul came along

697
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:08,112
and tried to do us harm
that we'd strike 'em down

698
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:13,655
with the help of the
righteous almighty God.

699
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,242
Also, I been thinkin' about the children.

700
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:25,713
I don't want them to have
contact with the outside world.

701
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,507
They're gonna become contaminated.

702
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:34,634
So I think what's best is that
they should live here with us

703
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,349
forever and ever and ever.

704
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:23,065
No, stop it!

705
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:36,575
Listen.

706
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,125
That's a radio.

707
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,629
They don't have one.

708
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:46,998
They don't have a radio.

709
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:48,044
Come on, Cyn.

710
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,173
Come on.

711
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:47,604
Cynthia!

712
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,527
Run, Cynthia, run!

713
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,276
Run, Cynthia!

714
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,878
Don't be scared, Cyn.

715
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:11,249
I'm not gonna let those bad boys hurt you.

716
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:15,378
Come on, I'll take you back
to the house, to Ma and Pa.

717
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:25,267
No!

718
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:28,687
No!

719
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,449
Leave me alone!

720
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:46,750
Leave me alone!

721
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,381
You killed her.

722
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,513
I'm gonna tell Pa.

723
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,466
Don't whoop me none, Pa.

724
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:27,885
I didn't mean it.

725
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,438
Well, she was bad.

726
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,064
You said so yourself, didn't he Ma?

727
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,436
Didn't he say so?

728
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:38,437
He did it.

729
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,815
He did it, Pa, just like I told you.

730
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:41,656
Then he...

731
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,151
No, you're tellin'!

732
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:45,869
Don't sass your Pa.

733
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,202
You was a naughty boy.

734
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,325
It was not my fault, Pa.

735
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:54,415
I couldn't help it.

736
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,382
Don't let him do it to me, Ma.

737
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,092
Get up on the hill.

738
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:03,632
Get up on the hill!

739
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:07,220
Come on, get up here.

740
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,969
Get up here when I talk to you!

741
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:13,939
And turn around and prepare
yourself for God's justice.

742
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,182
Turn around.

743
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:16,980
In the name of God!

744
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:20,264
In the name of God!

745
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,738
In the name of God.

746
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:27,728
In the name of God.

747
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:29,830
In the name of God, in the name of God.

748
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,619
In the name of God.

749
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,118
- Pa, stop!
- In the name of God.

750
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:35,084
In the name of God.

751
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,579
In the name of God.

752
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,125
In the name of God.

753
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,124
In the name of God.

754
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:43,627
In the name of God, in the name of God.

755
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,345
In the name of God.

756
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:48,010
In the name of God.

757
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,562
- And we'll pick blueberries
on the other side

758
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,684
of the island.

759
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:03,689
And Ma will make us a
blueberry pie, won't you Ma?

760
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:07,527
Oh, land sakes, child, we'll see.

761
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:13,741
- I'm so glad Ma and Pa's
lettin' you stay with us, Cyn,

762
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,663
'cause now I have someone to play with

763
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,378
'sides them rough old boys.

764
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,872
And we have a surprise for you

765
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,590
that you're gonna like real well.

766
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,258
Ain't that right, Ma?

767
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,051
Mhm.

768
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,719
Don't Cyn look pretty?

769
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:42,604
You made that dress just right, Ma.

770
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,821
Yep, pretty as a picture.

771
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,115
There.

772
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,293
Oh Lord, bless us for this day

773
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:01,414
and also the protection
you have always given us

774
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:05,088
and the peace and the
quiet of our little island.

775
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,713
And most of all, thank
thee for the blessin'

776
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:13,926
of the new member our happy
little family, Cynthia.

777
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:17,478
Amen.

778
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,223
Amen.

779
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,225
Okay, Fanny, come on now.

780
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,067
Let's see what kinda lungs you got.

781
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,527
See if you can blow 'em out.

782
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:44,835
Now let's see if you can blow 'em out.

783
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,003
Come on, now, let's see.

784
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,217
Blow!

785
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:53,307
- Come on, come on, come on,
come on there are two more.

786
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,470
Two more.

787
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,015
That's right, well done.

788
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,853
Well, let's cut it up, Ma.

789
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,721
Cut it up.

790
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,566
Not you, you're always tryin' to be first.

791
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,356
That's why you're so god damn big.

792
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,489
Ma, am I a clean plate clubber now?

793
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,364
Land sakes, child, you sure are.

794
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:17,865
All right, come on, you two.

795
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,912
We got some chores to do.

796
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:55,236
- Now can we
show her her surprise?

797
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,057
Now, close your eyes.

798
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:45,248
Oh.

799
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,208
My big dollies.

800
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:07,061
So my child, happy birthday, Fanny.

801
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,271
Thank you, Pa.

802
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,868
The last one's Doc Brown.

803
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:29,997
Ma and Pa made him a big
dolly right after they had me.

804
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:35,382
Oh, I remember when Pa
made him a big dolly.

805
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:38,256
He just wouldn't stop botherin' us.

806
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:41,433
I don't remember 'bout him.

807
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,427
Don't you, sweetie?

808
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,145
He came here in his boat, he did.

809
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:51,435
Liked the fishin' so much, he
was gonna tell his friends.

810
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:55,064
Well, we couldn't allow that.

811
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,443
I helped you, didn't I Ma?

812
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:00,910
Sure did, Woody.

813
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,459
Now this pair, they thought
they could do anything

814
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:10,329
they pleased on our beach.

815
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,046
Wicked creatures.

816
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:15,087
Well, Teddy surprised them all right.

817
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,350
Guess you know the rest, huh Cynthia?

818
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,728
Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.

819
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:42,911
- Told you that scarf would
suit you real well, young man.

820
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:03,841
This is a pretty dress for the baby.

821
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:04,637
Sure is.

822
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:08,846
Mom made it for me special.

823
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,519
- Are you gonna put
this dress on the baby?

824
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:13,141
Okay, sure I will.

825
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,033
Baby, baby.

826
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:36,332
What's that, Fan?

827
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:37,583
A bassinnete.

828
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,712
I'm gonna give my baby a bath
before I put on her new dress.

829
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:24,675
Fanny?

830
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:27,508
Fanny!

831
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:28,850
What Cyn?

832
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,389
Put my baby down!

833
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,057
Ain't your baby, it's mine.

834
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,649
And I'm gonna give my baby a bath.

835
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,188
Put my baby down!

836
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:41,734
It's mine!

837
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,128
Naughty, Woody.

838
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,813
- Teddy, run up to my
room and get me the red yard

839
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,181
from my basket.

840
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,399
Ma, I'm busy.

841
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,856
Don't rile me, son.

842
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:03,899
Get the yarn.

843
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:25,132
What?

844
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,422
Cyn, what's gotten into you?

845
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,422
Naughty, Teddy.

846
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:50,968
Oh God almighty.

847
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:58,277
Oh God, why hath thou forsaken me?

848
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,236
Oh, Fanny, Fanny.

849
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,088
My God.

850
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:22,722
Oh God, I want to talk to you.

851
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:25,387
Yes, I do.

852
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:29,395
I want you to listen to me.

853
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:31,143
Listen.

854
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:33,645
My family

855
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,277
is dead.

856
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,819
And we lived by your teachings.

857
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,575
I beat it into 'em.

858
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,034
I taught it to them.

859
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,953
And what have you done?

860
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,207
You did away with them.

861
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:59,209
Well, I have news for you.

862
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,586
I renounce you, God!

863
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:08,722
I renounce you and I
give my soul to Satan!
