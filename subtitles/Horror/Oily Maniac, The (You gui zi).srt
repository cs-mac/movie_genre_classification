1
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,335
Come on, it wasn't so bad.

2
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,762
What was that?

3
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:53,089
Please remind me, never
to go out with you.

4
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,676
- Fine, you don't have to.
- I won't.

5
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,302
Shut up! Stop laughing,
it's not funny.

6
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,257
- Are you okay?
- No.

7
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,878
Stupid shoes.

8
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:10,886
The fuck are you looking at?

9
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,174
But seriously, I've never seen
so many douchebags in one place.

10
00:01:14,292 --> 00:01:16,180
I don't know, that
tall one was kinda hot.

11
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,092
The Marilyn Manson?

12
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,127
- Hot!
- Gross!

13
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,423
- You take this, I'll take the next one.
- You little freak.

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,908
You're gonna go back
in there, aren't you?

15
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,257
Huh, no.

16
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,256
- Whatever.
- No.

17
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:31,299
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Stephanie.

18
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,886
What the fuck?

19
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:39,462
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You look so pretty.

20
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,708
- I had to just to scare you a little bit.
- Don't touch me.

21
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:45,215
I'm just trying to say hello,
you have such a pretty dress on.

22
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:49,213
Check it out, check it out..
We got a limo, we got weed, champagne.

23
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,506
<i>Just come hang with us.
Leave her alone.</i>

24
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:53,919
Why are you in a such a bad mood?

25
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,007
Can I have a cigarette at least?
Or something, a smile?

26
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,885
Fuck off.

27
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:02,006
She just threw a cigarette at me.

28
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,135
Bad vibe, bro.

29
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,011
- Not very nice.
- Not very nice.

30
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,419
Hi! Can you-

31
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:18,965
The fuck?!

32
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:24,011
<i>I see you too.</i>

33
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,545
That late and still out?

34
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,258
Better go home.

35
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:47,510
Oh, fuck.

36
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,340
<i>Okay.</i>

37
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,552
<i>I know where you live, Judy.</i>

38
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,627
<i>See you later.</i>

39
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,256
Yeah, I just got home.

40
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,052
God, I'm glad that's over.

41
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,293
I know.

42
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,674
It was just some old truck driver.

43
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,010
Yeah.

44
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,594
Ugh no, I didn't.
I just..

45
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:16,341
No, it freaked me out.

46
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,298
I know.

47
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,503
Yeah well, I blame you.

48
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:24,420
The stupid places you take me to.

49
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,335
Oh crap.

50
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,465
The lights are out on my floor.

51
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,635
Ok, bye.

52
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,628
- Where'd you park the car?
- It's downstairs.

53
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,534
You got the address?

54
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,258
Yeah. You better hurry,
we're gonna be late.

55
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:23,419
Please don't scream.

56
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,086
You're so beautiful.

57
00:06:56,042 --> 00:07:03,176
<b>MANIAC</b>

58
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,469
Hello, Redlucie86.

59
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,257
<i>Truly timid?</i>

60
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,927
It's my first time on a dating site.

61
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,417
There's a reason
I'm called timid man.

62
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,669
Picture..

63
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,428
That sounds lovely.

64
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,302
Why didn't you agree?

65
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,670
Of course I have.

66
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,177
- Lucie?
- Frank.

67
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,171
- Hi.
- Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

68
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:36,715
No charm, I'm sure.

69
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:44,259
- You are totally not what I imagined.
- Really? What did you imagine?

70
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,838
Umm, like fat, with long black hair

71
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,300
and just greasy skin full of acne.

72
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,385
Huh, you should've seen the other photo
I was going to send you.

73
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:58,092
I mean people always post
the best pictures of themselves

74
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,049
and then that's what something
is like when you meet them.

75
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,302
I ordered some wine.
I hope you don't mind.

76
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,091
No, I like a man
who takes control.

77
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,343
Thank you.

78
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:17,385
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

79
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,383
So, how long have you been using
the website?

80
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,636
Uhh, like six months, maybe?

81
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,461
But this is my first dinner date,
usually it's just for drinks.

82
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,048
Although I can already tell that
you are a breath of fresh air

83
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,802
for the jugheads I deal
with at the bar every night, ugh.

84
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:36,134
See, it's really easy to get over
with the testosterone at work, you know?

85
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,010
Yeah.

86
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:46,841
So, why don't you have
a girlfriend?

87
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,090
- I..
- Are you okay?

88
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,594
I just..

89
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,052
Frank, are you okay?

90
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,631
You look pale.

91
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,423
Is everything okay?

92
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,298
Well, excuse me, I-

93
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,007
I need to find the restroom.

94
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:08,547
Did that waiter even look Indian to you?
I think he looked more Mexican.

95
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,045
He was such a tool.

96
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,006
You know, it was really sweet
of you to drive me home.

97
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,294
I'm happy to do it.

98
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,216
I had a very lovely evening.

99
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,917
Did you wanna come up
for a drink?

100
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,630
Are you sure?

101
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,209
Uh, like I said -
begging really isn't my thing, so..

102
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,927
Right. Okay then.

103
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,547
Sounds nice.

104
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,801
So what's all that stuff
back there?

105
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,545
I thought you were a journalist
or something.

106
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,836
It's for a fashion shoot.

107
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,298
I'm just doing a favor
for a friend.

108
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,548
So where do you live, Frank?

109
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:57,296
Probably in some trendy loft
or something.

110
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,382
I mean my place isn't much
but it's all mine, so..

111
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,465
I'm done with roommates.

112
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:06,091
No, thank you.
I still have to drive home.

113
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,585
Yeah, but not now, right?

114
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:12,342
You should take off your coat
and stay for a little while.

115
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,552
Want me to put on some music?

116
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,254
I love this song.
Dance with me.

117
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,131
I think you're cute.

118
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,883
I'm gonna be right back.
You don't go anywhere.

119
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,052
You take a lot
of pictures of yourself.

120
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,468
Hi..

121
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:19,591
I wanted to slip into something
a little more comfortable.

122
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,386
So how about that coat?

123
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,344
Now it's your turn to do me.

124
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,004
Why.. Why are you hiding?

125
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:52,840
I don't know.

126
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,502
They're little.

127
00:14:57,292 --> 00:15:00,296
What do you think?
You wanna touch them?

128
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,583
You shouldn't be so scared,
timid man.

129
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,923
Your hands feel warm.

130
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,255
Squeeze them.

131
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,006
You can do it harder.

132
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,253
You wanna get rough playing?

133
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,924
Is that what you're into?

134
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,548
Are you gonna fuck me?

135
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:34,795
I can't. I can't.

136
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,256
Don't be a pussy.

137
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,131
You like it?

138
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,334
I like to keep the lights on too.

139
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,174
Don't be so horrified.

140
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,545
You just relax.

141
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,094
Why can't you leave them alone?

142
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:32,217
Why can't you leave any
of them alone?

143
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,510
Can I have just one

144
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,216
without you getting in the way?

145
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,968
Now look..

146
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,344
Look what you made me do.

147
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,128
Look what you made me do!

148
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:49,797
I hate you.

149
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,169
I hate you.

150
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:54,920
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

151
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,006
I'll make it better.

152
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,716
I'll make it all better now.

153
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,378
Sorry I missed you today.

154
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,341
I have a surprise for you.

155
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,719
Are you asleep already?

156
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:41,091
I'm sorry but I just can't wait.

157
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,676
Alright.

158
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,627
Take a look.

159
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,378
I saved the best for last.

160
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,798
Here we go.

161
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,594
Oh, that's nice.

162
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,211
Perfect fit, right?

163
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,879
Okay now, this might
sting a little.

164
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,381
Okay, good.

165
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:24,715
Good.

166
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,801
Just one more..

167
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,968
Perfect.

168
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,926
Perfect.

169
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:36,044
Meet Redlucie86.

170
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,254
Redlucie 86,
this is my girlfriend.

171
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,211
I know the two of you will
get along just fine.

172
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,673
Don't worry.

173
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:49,511
It's fine, it's fine.

174
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,427
What?
She's beautiful.

175
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,590
Why are you ignoring me, huh?

176
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,252
No, wait..

177
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,301
This is impossible.

178
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:03,759
No!

179
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,548
Why are you doing this to me?

180
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,669
What? You too?

181
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,676
Why?

182
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,505
You're just like her!
You two are the same thing as her!

183
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,506
Why are you doing this?

184
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,502
Why?

185
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,505
Hey.

186
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,335
I'm sorry to disturb you, uhm..

187
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,300
I was just taking pictures
of your mannequins in the window.

188
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:13,465
I hope that's okay?

189
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,752
- It's fine, I guess.
- Yeah?

190
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:19,633
Do you mind if I take pictures of them
with the gate open?

191
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,631
Okay, sure.

192
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,424
Yeah? Cool, thank you.

193
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:30,172
- What's this for?
- Oh, it's just fine art, I guess.

194
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,089
Here, take a look.

195
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,545
- Is that French? Your accent?
- Oui.

196
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,840
You have a good ear.

197
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:45,963
- What do you do exactly?
- I take pictures of mannequins.

198
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:49,796
I try to bring them
to life with light.

199
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:55,715
Okay, cool. Thank you.

200
00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:59,256
Sorry to have disturbed you.

201
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,511
I'm not usually opened on weekends.

202
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,466
Well, thank you
for opening up for me.

203
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,922
Bye.

204
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,085
Would you like to see my work?

205
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,215
What do you do?

206
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,423
Are you an artist?

207
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,256
I don't know about all that.

208
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:19,670
Come in, maybe you can tell me.

209
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,627
It's amazing.

210
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,344
They're from all styles and eras.

211
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,049
I've restored most of them myself.

212
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,715
She's beautiful.

213
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,335
I love her.

214
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,841
- What year is this from?
- Thirties.

215
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,628
She's in great condition.

216
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,169
You know what..

217
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:18,088
I'm having a show for my photos
in a gallery downtown.

218
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:22,383
Maybe I could use some of your
mannequins for my photoshoot.

219
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,503
That would be incredible, I mean..

220
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,797
They're so much more unique than
the ones I've been shooting with.

221
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,836
- Is this your place?
- Yes.

222
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,924
- You bought it?
- It was my family's.

223
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,882
Been restoring them
for three generations.

224
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,465
Who's Angela?

225
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,253
The name on the sign.

226
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,050
It was my mother.
She gone.

227
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,256
I'm sorry.

228
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:05,716
- Do you live here?
- Thank you for coming.

229
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,420
Sorry, I'm a little nosey.

230
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:12,757
I mean this place is so special.

231
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,795
So what do you think
if I rent them?

232
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,926
Uh, I'm not sure..

233
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,711
I usually try to find permanent
homes for them.

234
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,386
You're funny.

235
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:29,920
Well, I can adopt them.

236
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,085
What about that?

237
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,423
I'll give you my number.

238
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:45,169
So if you change your mind, I promise
to have them home before midnight.

239
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,174
I can be a good mother.

240
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,798
- My name's Anna.
- Thank you.

241
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,923
Call me, please.

242
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,715
Oh and by the way..

243
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,844
You have lipstick on your face.

244
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,673
Have a great day.

245
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,673
Oh no. No, no, no.

246
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,756
No. Get out.

247
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,585
Get out.

248
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,669
Get out.

249
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,631
Get out. Go.

250
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,589
Go.

251
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,468
That's disgusting.

252
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,423
- Move it!
- I'm just waiting for my wife.

253
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,462
You have ten seconds
before I give you a sanitation.

254
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:22,969
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

255
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,548
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

256
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,669
I got my stuff.

257
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:18,295
Ugh, can you turn this on?

258
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,635
- I'm sorry!
- Shit, you scared me!

259
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,627
I forgot my tights.

260
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:22,552
- Hey, do you mind waiting for me, please?
- Sure, yeah.

261
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:23,839
Thanks.

262
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,878
I can't believe you
shoved me in my locker.

263
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:28,715
Don't be tight.

264
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:31,048
- It was just a joke.
- Come on..

265
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:33,877
I could've broke my ankle.

266
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,378
- It still hurts.
- You're such a prick.

267
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,708
- But seriously.
- Tough it up.

268
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:45,542
- Come on girl, just come out with us.
- One drink.

269
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,301
- No.
- Come on, hun.

270
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,003
- Why don't you wanna come out?
- I'm going home.

271
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,795
- You never come out with us.
- What's up with that?

272
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:54,385
- The car's right up there.
- No way.

273
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:01,087
- You guys, I think I really hurt
my leg bad today. - Really?

274
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,594
- How?
- I went so fast with that twitch at.

275
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,127
I really don't think those tights
are any better.

276
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,210
- Good night, girls.
- Good night.

277
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:10,419
- Get home safe.
- Bye.

278
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:13,587
Text me, let me know.
Good night.

279
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,676
Oh, fuck.

280
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:41,298
- You're so beautiful.
- Shit.

281
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:45,839
Oh, shit.

282
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,218
What the fuck?!

283
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,844
Leave me the fuck alone!

284
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,669
Get away from me.

285
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,218
Somebody! Help me!

286
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,252
What the fuck?
Where is everyone?

287
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,301
Please, help me!

288
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,173
Please! Help me.

289
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,210
Help me!

290
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:58,632
Somebody! Open it!

291
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:01,294
Please!

292
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,922
Hey!

293
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:11,885
Please.

294
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,590
Open the gate, come on!

295
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:49,960
Oh fuck.

296
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:51,752
No, no.

297
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:54,048
Shit.
Oh, shit.

298
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,676
Fuck!

299
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,051
Oh, fuck.

300
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,835
No! No!

301
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,176
Please!

302
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,048
No!

303
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,544
Please.

304
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,877
No!

305
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,380
No!

306
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:45,671
Stop looking at me,
focus on your work.

307
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:49,963
- Anna, can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure. What do you need?

308
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:52,836
A hand, behind you.

309
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,927
- Which one?
- Second row.

310
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,552
- This one?
- The one on the right.

311
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,301
Oh, sorry.

312
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,003
Doctor Frankenstein, I presume.

313
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:13,386
- Are you a fan of those old films?
- For sure.

314
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,460
Okay, so what do you think
about my idea

315
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,708
of putting the mannequins among
the guests at the show?

316
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:21,886
You could see them mingling,
like they're real people.

317
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:25,876
Sometimes I think they have
more personality than most people.

318
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:31,128
I think we may have some
of the same friends.

319
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:40,713
- So, what do you think?
- I think you're incredibly talented.

320
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:43,924
- Well, that makes two of us then.
- Not really.

321
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:47,053
- I'm just a restorer.
- That one's my favorite.

322
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,711
Okay, now you show me.

323
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,256
It's amazing.

324
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:05,042
- It's gonna be perfect, Frank.
- I'm glad you like them.

325
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,927
- I love them.
- Why did you want them to be faceless?

326
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:12,217
Oh, I have a little idea for the show.
You'll see.

327
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:16,132
Okay, I'm starving. Are you hungry?
You wanna grab some lunch with me?

328
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:21,542
It's my third exhibition since
I've graduated from art center.

329
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,886
But it's my first with this gallery.

330
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:28,593
If it's successful they'll give me a show
in their other galleries in New York.

331
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:33,050
If something was missing.. Something
tangible relating to the concept-

332
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,084
The installation of your mannequins with
create the ambiance I was looking for.

333
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,878
You know, when you came into my shop
you looked at them

334
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:41,885
like noone else ever did.

335
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,589
You seem captivated.

336
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,219
- You must have thought I was crazy.
- No.

337
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:49,796
You were so soulful with them.
So present.

338
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:53,882
When my mother died last summer,
I wasn't so sure what to do with our shop.

339
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:56,135
Most stores couldn't care less
about restoring antiques.

340
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:58,252
It's cheaper to buy them new.

341
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:00,927
And if I closed the shop
I would've had to abandon them.

342
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:04,292
It's like me and my old negatives.

343
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,844
I have boxes full of them but I could
never see myself getting rid of them.

344
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:09,131
Sometimes it's hard to move on.

345
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:14,465
So what does your girlfriend
think of your work?

346
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,630
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Really? Okay..

347
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:22,173
I thought you lived with someone.

348
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:25,877
Frank?

349
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:29,792
- Are you okay? - It's nothing.
- It's just a migraine. It'll pass.

350
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:33,592
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, no, no-I'll be fine.

351
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,879
I just need my meds.
I'm used to it.

352
00:43:37,583 --> 00:43:41,167
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Are you sure you don't need help here?

353
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:44,094
No, thanks.
I just need to be alone.

354
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:01,010
Watch it, fuck face.

355
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,877
Are you suffering from a migraine?

356
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,800
This will have a similar effect
but you won't need a prescription for it.

357
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:09,555
And it comes in a nasal
spray, so it'll work faster.

358
00:44:09,568 --> 00:44:11,217
Thank you.

359
00:44:47,792 --> 00:44:51,296
<i>We have found links connecting
the two victims in mid-town.</i>

360
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,673
<i>But as our investigation
is still developing</i>

361
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:56,256
<i>I can not give you
any more details.</i>

362
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:59,462
<i>All I can say is that all
of these women were caucasian,</i>

363
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:02,504
between the ages of 20-30.

364
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,798
They can talk all they want.

365
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:07,011
But they will never understand.

366
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,511
As long as you keep a secret.

367
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:13,001
But if you can't, it'll find you..

368
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:15,135
and you'll be alone.

369
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,093
You hear that?!

370
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:18,760
The lot of you.

371
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,627
Alone.

372
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:28,046
- Now promise me you won't tell.
- Franky?!

373
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,048
Hey, it's mommy.

374
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,586
Franky, honey, where are you?

375
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:37,548
Franky!

376
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:13,631
Come here.

377
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:42,427
Shh, momma loves you.

378
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:32,881
Hey.

379
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,170
The necklace is beautiful, Frank.
Thank you so much.

380
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:38,927
- Did you make it?
- I did.

381
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:40,839
That's original.

382
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:42,885
Where did you get the stone?

383
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,877
It's something I found
in a thrift store.

384
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:47,761
Is that real hair?
What is it?

385
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:51,049
- I believe it's horse hair.
- That's interesting.

386
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:54,261
And what about you?
Are you feeling better?

387
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:58,634
Oh, sure.
I've had migraines since I was a kid.

388
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,215
I forgot to take my medicine, so..

389
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:04,796
It's really nothing.
Sorry if I've frightened you.

390
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:07,636
- It's okay.
- I just finished on-

391
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:15,963
Um, you know-Sometimes I feel like
you come from another era.

392
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:18,670
I love it.
It makes you very different.

393
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:21,715
One second, Frank.
I'm sorry.

394
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,798
Thank you so much.

395
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,630
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

396
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:30,172
Sorry Frank, a friend of mine
was helping me and I had to say goodbye.

397
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:36,383
I sometimes feel like
a slave-driver, you know?

398
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:40,262
- I hate it.
- I can't say I know what you mean.

399
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:42,631
I've always worked alone.

400
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:46,924
- You never feel lonely?
- Yeah.

401
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:49,798
That's why I was calling.

402
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:52,136
I thought if you weren't
doing anything..

403
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:53,544
I would love to.

404
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:55,920
But I have so much to do tonight.

405
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,632
But what about tomorrow?
We could do something.

406
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:01,636
Okay, yeah.
Tomorrow night works.

407
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,469
- What time?
- Nine?

408
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:08,754
- Is that okay?
- Nine is perfect.

409
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:12,175
- I'll pick you up at the gallery?
- Yeah, super.

410
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:13,885
Cool.

411
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:15,797
Good night, Frank.

412
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:17,590
Good night, Anna.

413
00:49:58,292 --> 00:50:01,262
Stop staring.
You're missing a movie.

414
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:15,924
Franky? Hey, it's mommy.
Franky?

415
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:18,420
Franky, honey, where are you?

416
00:50:20,042 --> 00:50:21,840
Franky?

417
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,298
Are you alright?

418
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,048
Yeah, yeah.

419
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:50,044
I'm fine.

420
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:58,794
So what'd you think?

421
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:02,876
<i>You know, Caligari is -
to be the first horror movie.</i>

422
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:06,336
I really thought she was gonna
get killed at the end.

423
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,093
I'm glad that she didn't.

424
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:11,922
Yeah, but they all end up living
in a mental hospital.

425
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:15,337
I know but at least
it was a happy ending.

426
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:20,713
I may have just found
the last romantic.

427
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,173
Sorry.

428
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,460
Hello?

429
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:28,922
Yeah.

430
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:31,715
Where are you?

431
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,586
Yeah, okay. Cool.

432
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,593
Yeah, I would love to.

433
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:41,000
Okay, I'll call you back
in five minutes. Ciao.

434
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:46,095
It's my boyfriend.
He's at a bar having a drink.

435
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:48,465
You wanna have a drink with him?

436
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:52,428
Frank?
Are you okay?

437
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:55,336
- It's okay. I'm tired.
- Are you having another migraine?

438
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,502
No, I'm fine.

439
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,761
I just have some more work
I have to do at the shop.

440
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,798
Have fun, though.

441
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:04,301
- Let's have one drink.
- No.

442
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:05,801
- Just one.
- Really.

443
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,419
Come on.

444
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,299
- I had a very nice evening.
- Okay.

445
00:52:21,758 --> 00:52:23,444
Another time, I guess.

446
00:52:23,479 --> 00:52:25,131
Good night, Frank.

447
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,585
Goodbye, Anna.

448
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:34,466
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

449
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:15,091
Go wait for me in the car, Franky.

450
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:20,302
Don't just stand there.

451
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:22,669
Do as I tell you!

452
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:33,506
Go wait for me in the car,
goddamm it. Franky!

453
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:46,796
- Hey guys.
- Hey. Good show.

454
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:48,590
- Do you think?
- Absolutely.

455
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,423
- Really?
- It's great.

456
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,045
Are you serious?

457
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,002
One second.

458
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,674
- Hey Frank, I'm so happy to see you.
- Hello Anna.

459
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:11,635
- You look stunning.
- Thank you.

460
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:13,965
- Really, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

461
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:17,337
I just feel like I'm in
a carnival costume.

462
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,754
This heels make me walk
like an ostrich.

463
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:26,171
- I'm happy you made it, though.
- Me too.

464
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:30,088
- Your photos are breathtaking.
- Thank you.

465
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:34,175
The way you made the mannequins
come to life at the projections.

466
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,343
- Yeah.
- It's you, right?

467
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,377
Yeah, it's me.

468
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:41,886
My face on your mannequins.

469
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:51,883
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Yeah, sure.

470
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,218
You lose something?

471
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:22,417
Anna loves to hang out
with her gay friends.

472
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:27,009
I guess it's a way for a man never have to
worry about trying to fuck her.

473
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:34,302
You're the mannequin guy, right?

474
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,051
Lemme ask you something.

475
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:39,132
Did you play with dolls
when you were a kid?

476
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,378
- I'm not gay.
- What?

477
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:53,669
Good talk.

478
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:03,176
<i>A famous person once said:</i>

479
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,628
<i>An artist is somebody
who produces things,</i>

480
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:07,510
<i>that people don't need.</i>

481
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:10,794
You know..

482
00:57:11,542 --> 00:57:14,716
Your work might interest
another client of mine,

483
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:20,419
whose general theme is destruction
of completely useless objects.

484
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:23,712
I'm sure he'd love to smash up
some of your mannequins

485
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,835
at his next photoshoot.

486
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,968
I'm in restoration.

487
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,631
So tell me, Fred-

488
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:33,921
How does the restoration
process take place?

489
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,758
Do you go dumpster diving,
department stores garbage bins

490
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,881
in search of used parts?

491
00:57:40,042 --> 00:57:43,546
They're antiques.
You wouldn't find them in dumpsters.

492
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:46,917
Honestly, I just find
the whole thing really creepy.

493
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:49,586
You and Anna are the perfect fit.

494
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,128
- Do you have a card?
- No.

495
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,959
- Let me see if I have a pen.
- Dominique!

496
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:58,636
Gorgeous!

497
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:06,960
- Any buyers?
- A few offers.

498
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:10,299
But don't worry, the real money's
in New York. Okay?

499
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:15,584
- Okay, should I call you a cab?
- No, I don't live far. I think I'll walk.

500
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:19,550
- I can call you a cab.
- No, no, no. You go have fun, fun, fun.

501
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:21,381
- Okay.
- And congratulations.

502
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:23,544
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Bye, sweetheart.

503
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,920
- What's wrong with you?
- I guess I..

504
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:29,177
Why do you always
have to do this?

505
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:29,421
- Welcome back.
- It's nice to see you.

506
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,460
- Hey Jimmy. Have you been good?
- Excellent.

507
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:42,462
Changing your makeup
and hair style didn't fool me.

508
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:48,761
You didn't think I'd recognize you?

509
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:50,669
Why?

510
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,719
Cause you think I'm stupid?

511
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,674
Why do you act like
I don't exist?

512
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:04,427
I never wanted to hurt you.

513
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:08,006
But you made me.

514
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:10,210
Didn't you?

515
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:12,169
Yes.

516
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,968
Yes, you did.

517
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:32,011
Did you need to be
with all of them? Huh?

518
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:35,130
Did you?

519
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,298
Was it the money?

520
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:44,801
Answer me!

521
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:50,011
You knew, they didn't love you.

522
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:56,170
Not like I loved you.

523
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,176
Not like me.

524
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:04,461
I still love you.

525
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,673
You know that?

526
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:24,420
Please don't kill me.

527
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:28,334
- Please don't kill me.
- Oh. I'm not gonna kill you.

528
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:31,795
I'm gonna keep you.

529
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:37,627
Mommy.

530
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:52,217
You will not go out tonight.
Is that clear?

531
01:04:52,417 --> 01:04:55,136
You will stay home with me.

532
01:05:28,375 --> 01:05:32,676
Hey, it's Anna.
Leave a message after the tone.

533
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:35,965
Hi Anna. It's Frank.

534
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:38,256
I'm sorry to bother you
at this hour.

535
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:41,549
I just wanted to know how long
you wanted to keep the mannequins.

536
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:43,961
I have another client..

537
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:50,136
Anna? What's wrong?
Are you okay?

538
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,923
Rita, my agent..

539
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,211
She was murdered last night
in her apartment.

540
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:58,094
Murdered?
Oh my god.

541
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,629
Police just called me,
asking me so many questions.

542
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,425
Someone broke into her place.

543
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,548
They must have been
waiting for her.

544
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:11,336
Frank, it's awful.

545
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:14,712
I can't believe it.
I swear it's a nightmare.

546
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,925
You shouldn't be alone now.
Is your boyfriend with you?

547
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:23,042
No. He's back in New York already.

548
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:25,210
Do you need company?

549
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:29,005
- No, it's okay.
- No, don't be silly.

550
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:33,092
It's no bother.
That's what friends are for, right?

551
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:37,426
- I don't wanna trouble you with this.
- Anna, I'll be there in 30 minutes.

552
01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:57,044
I know.

553
01:06:57,292 --> 01:07:00,421
Me too.
I miss her too.

554
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,502
It's been a long time.

555
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:06,750
I'm gonna get her back.
I promise.

556
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,801
Come in.

557
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:29,965
I didn't hear the intercom.

558
01:07:30,125 --> 01:07:32,628
One of your neighbors
was walking out when I got here.

559
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:36,797
I saw your name on the mailbox.
I hope you don't mind.

560
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:39,965
I'm happy to see you.

561
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,878
Oh, I didn't know you had company.

562
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,252
I don't mean to intrude.

563
01:07:51,292 --> 01:07:53,545
Martin lives next door.

564
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,719
- Did you guys not meet at the show?
- No but I've heard a lot about you.

565
01:07:56,917 --> 01:08:00,626
- Martin Nunez.
- Frank.

566
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:08,219
He's a stylist.
He's helping me with the mannequins.

567
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,048
Yes but I'm really an actor.

568
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,711
I actually just booked
my first national, so..

569
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:14,715
I don't know what that means.

570
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:18,382
It's a national commercial.
For Sparkle toothpaste.

571
01:08:18,542 --> 01:08:20,510
See
- Ding!

572
01:08:22,125 --> 01:08:24,594
Alright well..
I'm gonna leave you guys.

573
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:27,674
I actually have an audition
first thing in the morning.

574
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:30,048
So, if you'll excuse me..

575
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:35,879
- Oh honey. It's gonna be fine.
- Thank you.

576
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,173
Take good care of her, Frank.

577
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:41,380
See you.

578
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:47,757
It must've been
a very long day for you.

579
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:54,545
I know what it feels
like to lose someone.

580
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:56,756
I'm here for you, Anna.

581
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,049
Why would your boyfriend leave
for New York now?

582
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:07,628
Oh, we got into such
a fight after the show.

583
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:09,886
It's always about him and..

584
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:13,667
I don't even know what I was thinking
hooking up with that guy.

585
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:17,004
Really. He's such a music guy.

586
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:19,336
Huh, they can be very pompous.

587
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:21,627
Yeah.

588
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:27,011
I'm gonna make us coffee, okay?

589
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:32,386
That was the first day we met.

590
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,503
I didn't take care of her.

591
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:50,126
I was too busy talking to other people
and she left by herself.

592
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:53,261
Don't blame yourself.

593
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:55,753
It's really not your fault.

594
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,798
Just try to let go.

595
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,298
I know what you need.

596
01:10:15,417 --> 01:10:17,385
I'm so tense.

597
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:56,884
You know, hair is the only part
of the body that lasts forever.

598
01:10:57,042 --> 01:10:58,794
I'm sorry, I can't.

599
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:02,379
- I should've sent her home.
- Anna.

600
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,673
She knew what she was doing.

601
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:06,969
She lived three blocks away.

602
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:09,719
What were the chances
of her getting attacked?

603
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:15,466
Other girls were killed
and you had nothing to do with them.

604
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:18,344
Believe me, it's not your fault.

605
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:25,627
I asked Rita needed a ride
and that's when she told me.

606
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:29,875
- Told you what?
- Where she lived.

607
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:32,215
Isn't that what you were wondering?
How I knew?

608
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:35,675
I was just wondering what other girls
you were talking about.

609
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,379
The girls that were mutilated
and murdered.

610
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:43,211
It's all over the news.

611
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:46,336
Rita had the same profile.

612
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:48,590
Don't you think?

613
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:52,129
The police never mentioned anything
about other girls.

614
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:56,376
It's probably an ongoing investigation.
That's why.

615
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:04,046
Anna, you need to relax.

616
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:07,553
- Let me massage you again.
- It's okay.

617
01:12:07,792 --> 01:12:10,261
I- I would justÉ

618
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:13,177
rather go to sleep, okay?

619
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,802
And we talk tomorrow.

620
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,551
I'm very tired.

621
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,423
Wait!

622
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:25,672
I came all over across town
to be with you in your time of need.

623
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:29,966
Well, I would rather be alone.

624
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:32,343
Please.

625
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:34,795
Being alone isn't going
to help you.

626
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,503
Believe me. I know.

627
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:41,467
I'm just gonna ask you
to leave now. Please.

628
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:43,593
What's the matter, Anna?

629
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:46,378
I thought we've become friends,
you and I.

630
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:49,336
You sound like a stranger.

631
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,219
Why are you scared?

632
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,585
Anna, come.

633
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:03,378
I think we need to
have a little talk.

634
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:07,298
Get off me.

635
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,673
Just calm down.

636
01:13:13,792 --> 01:13:17,046
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

637
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:20,424
It seems that we need to
iron a few things.

638
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:22,927
You know what I mean, don't you?

639
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:28,336
Come, I think we need
to have a serious talk.

640
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:36,299
- Get off me!
- Let me explain it to you!

641
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:39,381
Get off!

642
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,923
Martin! Help me!

643
01:13:54,292 --> 01:13:55,919
Help!

644
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,379
- What's the matter, Anna?
- Leave me alone.

645
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,468
Go away.
Please, go away.

646
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:14,754
<i>Anna, it's me, Martin.
Open the door.</i>

647
01:14:14,958 --> 01:14:18,132
<i>Anna, what's happening in there?
Is everything alright?</i>

648
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:24,465
<i>Anna, open the door.</i>

649
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:32,585
- Anna?
- Martin!

650
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,503
- Anna, where are you?
- In the bathroom.

651
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,381
Anna, open up.

652
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,126
I'm sorry.

653
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:51,879
I'm sorry.
Open the door.

654
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:55,302
Open the door! Anna!

655
01:14:56,875 --> 01:15:00,084
- Martin?
- No, it's not Martin.

656
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,218
It's just you and me.

657
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:06,255
Now open up and let me explain!

658
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:09,174
- Martin, are you okay?
- Anna.

659
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:11,256
It's me.

660
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,173
What's happening?

661
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:28,960
I came all across the town
to be with you in your time of need.

662
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:32,298
I'm sorry. Please.

663
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,377
Let's talk first.

664
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:37,426
Leave me alone!

665
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,048
- Just go.
- No.

666
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:43,712
- You need to understand.
- Go, please.

667
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,173
Put the knife down.

668
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:52,920
Put the knife, Anna.
Put the knife down.

669
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,301
Put the knife down!

670
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:10,135
Just calm down.

671
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,510
Calm down.

672
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:16,591
Just relax, just relax.

673
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:19,173
It's okay.

674
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:22,423
It's okay.

675
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,176
Okay.

676
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:52,045
<i>Patrol 19, stand by.
Code 4-8.</i>

677
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:54,757
<i>Possible suicide.
Marian Avenue 728.</i>

678
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:57,336
<i>This is 19, we're on our way.</i>

679
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:12,585
It's gonna be okay.

680
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,127
Anna, please!

681
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:49,585
Help!

682
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:54,051
Help!

683
01:17:57,792 --> 01:17:59,465
Anna!

684
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:01,426
Somebody?

685
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:09,336
Wait!
Anna!

686
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:40,969
- Help me!
- Anna.

687
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,127
- Stop the car!
- What are you doing?

688
01:18:43,625 --> 01:18:45,548
- Help!
- No.

689
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:49,085
No! No, no, no!

690
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:19,468
Oh, no!

691
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,461
Anna! Why did you do that?

692
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:43,469
Didn't you understand?

693
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:46,552
I just wanted to be with you.

694
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:49,757
I just wanted to be with you, Anna.

695
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:53,094
I never touched you.

696
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:54,505
Not once.

697
01:19:57,375 --> 01:20:00,254
Anna, I want to introduce you
to my mother.

698
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,792
We'll be together forever, Anna.

699
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,843
I promise.

700
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:46,550
No one will separate us again.

701
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:43,835
Hey Frank.

702
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:48,504
- Do you like my nipples, Frank?
- Shut up!

703
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:51,631
God, your hands are so warm.

704
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:54,219
- I'm gonna get you back, Frank.
- She's lying.

705
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:56,673
Please don't listen to her.
Don't listen to her.

706
01:21:56,833 --> 01:22:00,087
Did you play with dolls
as a child, Fred?

707
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:02,260
You wanna take a bath?

708
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:04,552
- No.
- You wanna take a bubble bath?

709
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:05,960
No. I do not.

710
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:09,386
Now leave. Leave!

711
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:13,962
Oh, Frank. What happened?

712
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:18,005
I knew you were in the locker,
you naughty boy.

713
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,631
Did you like what you saw, Frank?

714
01:22:20,792 --> 01:22:23,136
Don't listen to them.
They're lying.

715
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:25,886
Frank, don't bring
any other girls home.

716
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:28,006
I get jealous.

717
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:30,761
I'm gonna tear you to pieces, Frank.

718
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:33,962
I don't even know them.
They're lying.

719
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:39,590
This is our home, Anna.

720
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,551
Welcome.

721
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:46,339
Welcome.

722
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:49,792
This is where we live now, Anna.

723
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:55,961
No, not you! Get out of here!

724
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:58,344
You hear me? Get out!

725
01:22:58,458 --> 01:23:01,883
Don't come near her. She is mine!
Do you hear me?

726
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,551
Get away!

727
01:23:03,708 --> 01:23:05,335
She belongs to me!

728
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:08,792
You will never understand
what we feel for one another.

729
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:11,051
Where is she? Where is she?

730
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:12,801
Answer me!

731
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:15,801
Get your hands off of me!

732
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:17,881
Please. Let go.

733
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:23,959
Ah, my leg!

734
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:33,300
