00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,759
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:29,513
Thank you,

3
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,661
The Prime Minister is coming,

4
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:46,129
What is this mess?

5
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:47,998
My apologies, sir,

6
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:49,733
You said to keep it confidential, so,,,

7
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,985
I'm sorry,

8
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,256
Please move,

9
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:14,558
Sorry,

10
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,634
Go and take care of it,

11
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,811
Prime Minister,

12
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,181
your shot was amazing,

13
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:46,783
You shine in politics and in golf,

14
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:49,419
You're so good at everything,

15
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,822
My family has been talented for generations,

16
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:58,094
Since your grandson will become a special,,,

17
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,863
scholarship student at Hankuk University,

18
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,098
this means we'll all be from the same school,

19
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,768
I can see that things will work out well,,,

20
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,137
since we're from the same school,

21
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,507
Thank you for all your efforts,,,

22
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,609
in helping our campus,

23
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:15,278
Like I said, it's conditional,,,

24
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,613
although it's almost ready,

25
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,783
The rest is up to Mayor Cho's luck,

26
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,120
- You should go, - Okay,

27
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,461
This one?

28
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,198
- Your form is good, - Yes,

29
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,100
Keep it like that,

30
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,305
Nice shot!

31
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,343
It's a hole-in-one,

32
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,047
Congratulations, Mayor Cho,

33
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:53,950
I hear this will make you lucky for three years,

34
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,020
Mayor Cho, looks like you have to treat us,

35
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,422
There's no doubt about it,

36
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:02,492
I'll host you on a full course,,,

37
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:05,195
for today and the next round too,

38
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,934
By the way, your shot was just as good,

39
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,674
Get a full shot,

40
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,689
Ms, Ma,

41
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:39,529
Good work,

42
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:42,299
Well, I always do a good job,

43
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,603
You suit being a cooperating attorney,

44
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:49,239
I look forward to working with you again,

45
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,475
I doubt we'll be working together again,

46
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,012
You must be mistaken,

47
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,948
I don't like helping others,

48
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:02,052
I help you, then you get all the credit,

49
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:04,354
All I get is a few hundred dollars,

50
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:06,656
Then what will you do now?

51
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,291
One moment,

52
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:10,894
- Yes, ma'am, - Where are you?

53
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,395
I'm coming to the office now,

54
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,999
What do you think? I'll be a prosecutor,

55
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,335
You just wait,

56
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,470
I'll come back as a prosecutor,,,

57
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,272
and become your senior,

58
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:25,475
I'll change your easygoing mind,

59
00:05:27,644 --> 00:05:29,679
Okay, I'll wait,

60
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,392
(Witch's Court)

61
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:04,013
Recording,

62
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,960
Here,

63
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,272
Seriously,

64
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:14,451
Give it to me,

65
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,564
What's wrong with this?

66
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,467
Hey, Do your job properly,

67
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,702
I told you to check on the scanner before,

68
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:34,737
- I'm sorry, - Jin Yun Hee,

69
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:56,125
You,,,

70
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:03,900
dropped one of your earrings,

71
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:10,406
- I see, - There's jewelry inside,

72
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,708
You should change them,

73
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,310
Okay,

74
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,019
Sir,

75
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:32,295
Marks don't mean anything,

76
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:34,664
Just looking at the family is enough,

77
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,035
To have your grandson enroll,,,

78
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,672
is an honor for Hankuk University,

79
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:44,073
What do you think?

80
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:45,708
Of course,

81
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,745
Like Hyungjae Group's Ahn Tae Kyoo,,,

82
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:50,847
and the daughter of Chief Secretary Min,

83
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:53,349
the children of great families,,,

84
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,151
are making the school shine,

85
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:58,788
Thanks to that, we were able to revamp,,,

86
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,157
the school gym and the auditorium,

87
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:05,595
South Korea is such a great country,

88
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:07,864
By helping each other,

89
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,033
we're making developments,

90
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,136
On that note,

91
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,505
I'm thinking of extending,,,

92
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:18,274
the school to Yeongpa,

93
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:21,711
Are you talking about a new campus?

94
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,046
Yes,

95
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:27,450
If Juyoung-dong will give the permission,

96
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,652
I would give,,,

97
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,921
full support,

98
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:33,957
Juyoung-dong in Yeongpa?

99
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,659
The Ministry of Land and the Ministry,,,

100
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,495
of National Defense will be against it,

101
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,968
That's why we're bringing it up,

102
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:49,472
If Hyungjae Group's White Town development,,,

103
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:51,341
sets in place near the school,

104
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,811
we'll be able to service,,,

105
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:57,313
even your grandchild's grandchild,

106
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,616
My grandchild's grandchild?

107
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,086
That sounds sweet to my ears,

108
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:07,056
Here, let's drink,

109
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:08,725
Yes,

110
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,694
Hey, Don't get mad about something like this,

111
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,530
- I'll buy you chicken, - Forget it,

112
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,799
- Stop being mad, - Let me go,

113
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,326
Gosh,

114
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,461
Why would he tell me on his way home?

115
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,996
I told him to do his job properly,

116
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,400
Not everyone can become the chief,

117
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:54,103
Gosh, Chief, this, Chief, that,

118
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:58,975
What would they do without me?

119
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,386
Yes,

120
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:12,922
Yes, sir,

121
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,724
Okay,

122
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:45,388
His secret to connections is simple,

123
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:46,823
He hires women for them and lobbies them,

124
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:49,158
He gets people on his side by providing,,,

125
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:51,027
women of their tastes and by throwing money,

126
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,729
That's very like him,

127
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,263
Even if we get him arrested for that,

128
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,099
it will only be seen as a compulsion,

129
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:59,302
Shouldn't we chase after his money?

130
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:00,470
No,

131
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,439
(2004 Cheong-Ungag Sexual Favors Issue)

132
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:04,540
Cheong-Ungag?

133
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,976
This is the case that made Cho what he is today,

134
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,713
In 2004 when Cho was a commissioner general,

135
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:14,684
Baek Sang Ho received bribes from hostess bars,

136
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:16,786
With that money, they made a slush fund,,,

137
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:18,488
and found a place they can lobby,

138
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:20,723
That's how Cho,,,

139
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,792
became a member of the National Assembly,

140
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,428
So ever since 2004, Cho grew bigger,,,

141
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:28,131
by providing women and lobbying?

142
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:30,066
That's right,

143
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,969
He made a space just like Cheong-Ungag,,,

144
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:36,172
and is providing sexual favors to high figures,

145
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,775
I'm going to put together a list of the regulars,,,

146
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,209
along with the evidence,,,

147
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:42,378
to arrest Cho Gap Soo,

148
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,580
A lobbying space?

149
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,483
Where is that?

150
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,051
It's Kingdom,

151
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:55,725
You're Ms, Min's secret agent,

152
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,061
(Jin Sul Hee)

153
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:00,196
I'm that woman's,,,

154
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,999
younger sister,

155
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,868
Her name is Jin Yun Hee,

156
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:08,404
She has the same goal as we do,

157
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,942
How do you know about Kingdom?

158
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,978
Because I've been there already,

159
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,982
Hyungjae Hotel, level K,

160
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,385
Level K?

161
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:24,520
Level K?

162
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:27,056
(You have one new voicemail,)

163
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,090
(Voicemail)

164
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,429
Hey, can you come save me?

165
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,164
I'm at Hyungjae Hotel's K,,,

166
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,801
That's where Kong Soo Ah's incident happened,

167
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,170
Did you know already?

168
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:45,608
I only found out recently,

169
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,743
After Yun Hee penetrated Kingdom,

170
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,546
Had we known earlier,

171
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:52,782
we could have taken care of Kong Soo Ah's case,

172
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,117
Lobbying, sexual favors,

173
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:56,786
and concealing a murder?

174
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,422
All of Cho's weaknesses are there,

175
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,792
I witnessed one of them last night,

176
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,634
It's recorded on this,

177
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:24,680
Here,

178
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,151
I couldn't get anything for a while,

179
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,753
so I thought I was wasting time,

180
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:33,089
But I found something bigger than I expected,

181
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,592
He's Kim Ho Kyung,

182
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:38,294
The chancellor of Hankuk University,

183
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:41,430
You know him, right? The Prime Minister,

184
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:46,002
He's involved in illicit admissions,

185
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,971
He's acting as the broker between,,,

186
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,773
high-ranking officials and Hankuk University,

187
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,443
Illicit admissions?

188
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:57,947
If I keep tailing him, we'll get something,

189
00:14:58,714 --> 00:14:59,749
Right,

190
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,652
Here,

191
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,889
Do you see the reflection of the car?

192
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:11,260
I met with the owner for the dash cam footage,

193
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,296
However,

194
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:16,232
someone asked to buy it, so they sold it,

195
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,100
They sold it?

196
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,771
Could it be Ms, Ma?

197
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,640
She's investigating Baek Sang Ho's death,

198
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,109
No, I don't think it's her,

199
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:29,512
She would have met with Baek Min Ho first,

200
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:36,385
That means someone wants to cover up,,,

201
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:38,821
Baek Sang Ho's death,

202
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:41,457
Could it be Cho Gap Soo?

203
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,898
Mr, Yeo, Jung Young Ho got arrested,

204
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,700
He was handed over to Mr, Koo,,,

205
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,368
from the Immigration Office,

206
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:03,612
Who is he?

207
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:06,282
He's the researcher from NFS that forged,,,

208
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:07,650
the evidence for Kong Soo Ah's case,

209
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,784
Is that so?

210
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:10,886
Great,

211
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,756
Jin Wook looks even more handsome in there,

212
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,358
He's sexy,

213
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,228
Jung Young Ho,

214
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,833
Do you admit that you forged,,,

215
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,501
the analysis report for Kong Soo Ah's case?

216
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,970
No, I don't know anything about this,

217
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:30,906
This is the statement from Lee Sang Joon,

218
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,608
the researcher in charge of DNA testing at NFS,

219
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:34,276
He said that the knuckle,,,

220
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,679
was never asked to be analyzed,

221
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:41,917
We were also able to restore the report,,,

222
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,853
you deleted from your computer,

223
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,454
(Restored files from Jung Young Ho's computer)

224
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,423
Just before handing in your resignation letter,

225
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:51,127
you received 200,000 dollars to your account,

226
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:53,396
(200,000 dollars)

227
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:56,565
Are you still going to say you don't know anything?

228
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:01,370
Who hired you?

229
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,180
I was hiding abroad,

230
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:12,715
so I couldn't be here,,,

231
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,117
for my father's passing,

232
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,887
I want to stay with him for his funeral,

233
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:21,557
Please get me indictment without detention,

234
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:25,795
Then I'll volunteer to turn myself in,

235
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,070
I told you, didn't I?

236
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,972
We need to find another way to get the list,

237
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,208
I told you not to go there as a hostess!

238
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,443
What should I do then?

239
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:44,046
Can we arrest Cho with the list?

240
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:45,581
We have to get inside,,,

241
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,384
to get real evidence of their wrongdoings,

242
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,252
Even still,

243
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,822
How can you go,,,

244
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,357
to entertain Park Myung Il?

245
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:56,826
What else can I do?

246
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,095
Do you have another idea?

247
00:17:59,528 --> 00:18:01,931
If you do, tell me,

248
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:07,937
Get out,

249
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,438
I don't need your evidence,

250
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:10,673
so take it and leave,

251
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:11,907
Ms, Min,

252
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:14,243
Go do whatever you want!

253
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,247
Ms, Min, but,,,

254
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,319
- Where are you going? - Yes,

255
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:28,284
I'm sorry,

256
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,590
I did it because I couldn't think,,,

257
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:38,127
of any other way to catch him,

258
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,301
So,,,

259
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:49,138
please catch him this time,

260
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,475
Never act on your own without my order,

261
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,311
Can you promise me?

262
00:19:57,713 --> 00:19:58,747
Yes,

263
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,721
You two are okay now, right?

264
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:08,457
Can we listen to this first?

265
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,529
Choi Yong Woon, the scanner can break,

266
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,764
Why did you embarrass me in front of a woman?

267
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,566
What? Hey,

268
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,569
I told you to call me a chief at work,

269
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:21,837
We're not at home,

270
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:23,872
Chief, my foot,

271
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,408
If I was the one who passed on the video,

272
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:28,077
I would be in your position!

273
00:20:28,077 --> 00:20:29,111
Hey!

274
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:31,680
I told you not to talk about the video,

275
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:33,449
If Cho Gap Soo finds out,

276
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,184
he'll kill us both!

277
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:36,652
Watch your mouth, okay?

278
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:37,953
Pay attention,

279
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,159
We got the statement from NFS,,,

280
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,363
admitting that the evidence was forged,

281
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:49,431
Both you and Ahn Tae Kyoo,,,

282
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,967
don't have any evidence left,

283
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,637
We have to start from the beginning,

284
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,675
You mentioned Ahn Tae Kyoo's video,

285
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:03,379
We can flip this case around if we have that,

286
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:07,283
Do you know where it could be?

287
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,119
Or do you know anyone who might have taken it?

288
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:13,155
- If you can,,, - How can I trust you?

289
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,793
I can't trust anyone right now,

290
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,863
Even my brother, whom I trusted,

291
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,732
died while trying to resolve my case,

292
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,669
I won't give up,

293
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,638
I'll set right everything that went wrong,

294
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:34,476
I have nothing else to say,

295
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:40,616
We don't have much time,

296
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:43,319
If you think of anything,

297
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,487
tell me before the statute of limitations expires,

298
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,436
I went to your brother's house to find the video,

299
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,939
but Cho Gap Soo got rid of the house,

300
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:24,760
I'm sorry,

301
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:31,400
I'm the one,,,

302
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,602
who did that,,,

303
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:35,871
to Sang Ho,

304
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:39,608
That prosecutor, Ma Yi Deum,

305
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:44,213
was holding a grudge against me,

306
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,450
I should've nipped it in the bud,

307
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:51,420
I failed to do that,

308
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,757
so it's my fault,

309
00:22:57,192 --> 00:22:58,994
Once we appeal,

310
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:00,996
your sentence will be shortened,

311
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:03,298
Suffer,,,

312
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,034
just a little longer,

313
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,405
When you get out,

314
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,407
you need to fill in for Sang Ho,

315
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:17,546
That way, he could relax up above,

316
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,018
What happened,,,

317
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:25,854
to our house,,,

318
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,290
and my brother's things?

319
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,600
Don't worry about a thing,

320
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,836
I kept everything as is,

321
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:43,906
Your house and your brother's things,

322
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,308
They're all being kept safe,

323
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:53,749
I need to tell the prosecutor something,

324
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:55,951
Your visit is over, Go in,

325
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,024
They said a video, right?

326
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:03,826
That's what I heard,

327
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,663
So they gave the original to Cho Gap Soo,

328
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,198
If he gave an obedient thug,,,

329
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,099
the title of chief,

330
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:14,069
the video has something that can destroy him,

331
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,605
It may be quicker,,,

332
00:24:16,605 --> 00:24:18,340
to get the video than the lobby list,

333
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,142
We need to find out where it is first,

334
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:23,645
Carefully approach Choi Yong Woon,

335
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:25,214
Not him,

336
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:26,381
I already tried,

337
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,016
but he's suspicious of others, so I gave up,

338
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:30,719
Okay,

339
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:32,888
Then I'll meet Dong Shik,

340
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:34,890
- You will? - Naturally,

341
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,425
I'm gifted,,,

342
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,427
at seducing men,

343
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:39,995
What was that?

344
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,196
Dong Shik,

345
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:42,898
He'll be mine soon,

346
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,112
You little punk,

347
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:48,163
Fruit platter please,

348
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,935
Excuse me,

349
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,303
Yes?

350
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:57,606
I'd like to give him this,

351
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,641
This?

352
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:00,876
Yes,

353
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,744
His glass is empty, Go on,

354
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:03,779
Okay,

355
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:11,620
What's this?

356
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,422
She sent it,

357
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,820
You should drink with me, considering all my effort,

358
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,223
Check, please,

359
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:25,761
This is humiliating,

360
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,295
Why doesn't he like me?

361
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,605
Come on,

362
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,507
I said let's have a drink,

363
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:40,108
What's wrong with you?

364
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:41,376
Dong Shik?

365
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:48,016
Yun Hee,

366
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:51,920
I have a girlfriend,

367
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:53,755
A girlfriend? Her?

368
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,924
- Let's go, - Sweetie,

369
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,759
who's that old lady?

370
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,995
Are you cheating on me?

371
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:01,063
What?

372
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:03,365
What do you mean? I have standards,

373
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:04,966
She's a crazy woman, Let's go,

374
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,703
Yes, he is cheating!

375
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:09,705
That liar, He was saying how much he liked me,

376
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:10,872
He kissed me too,

377
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:13,108
Babe! I said let's have another drink,

378
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,043
I don't look so bad today,

379
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:16,545
Ms, Ma?

380
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,749
You have the wrong person,

381
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:24,186
Wait, It really is you,

382
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,788
It is you, Ms, Ma,

383
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:33,361
You know, I believe all jobs are equal,

384
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:34,429
So do I,

385
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,664
Pardon?

386
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:37,999
I'm busy, so,,,

387
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,568
- But,,, - Okay,

388
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:40,602
But,,,

389
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:45,841
I heard lawyers have it tough lately,

390
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:48,043
but must she really do that?

391
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:49,711
What do you mean?

392
00:28:50,846 --> 00:28:53,482
Nothing, Let us live a good life, at least,

393
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:54,816
Goodness,

394
00:28:58,754 --> 00:28:59,855
You saw, right?

395
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:02,357
I had to get rid of that crazy woman,

396
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:05,026
Sorry for saying you were my girlfriend,

397
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:07,195
I don't mind,

398
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,264
What?

399
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:11,366
You don't need to apologize,

400
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:13,502
I was happy being your girlfriend,,,

401
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,170
for those few minutes,

402
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:17,272
What?

403
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:18,874
What do you mean?

404
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,742
You didn't know?

405
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:24,312
I liked you from the first time I saw you,

406
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:28,283
Me too,

407
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:34,556
How is the appeal preparation going?

408
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,592
We have plenty to rebut the assertions,,,

409
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:39,394
the prosecution has made,

410
00:29:39,394 --> 00:29:41,429
This has to be the last time,

411
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,598
Are you confident we'll win?

412
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:46,234
Yes, You may rest assured,

413
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,572
Tell me,

414
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:53,208
how long have you worked for Gap Soo?

415
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,110
I was scouted,,,

416
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,379
by Hyungjae when I left the prosecutors' office,

417
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,080
so I'm going on five years,

418
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,049
Five years?

419
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:06,087
Then you've done a lot,

420
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:10,058
Are you interested in working for me now?

421
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:15,897
At 10am at Yeongpa Cultural Center,

422
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,134
you have a lecture on "Making a Happy Yeongpa",

423
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:20,435
At 2pm,

424
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:23,572
you have the Regional Business Conference,

425
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:25,173
At 5pm,

426
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,075
after visiting Yeongpa Market,

427
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,710
you will be leading a meeting,,,

428
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,645
on how to revive the business district,

429
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,057
- Yes? - It's about Baek Min Ho,

430
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,527
I think he's going to tell that prosecutor something,

431
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,865
Take care of it,

432
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:51,566
Yes, sir,

433
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:09,184
Hey,

434
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:20,161
Found it,

435
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:24,966
What,,,

436
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,434
Bring him,

437
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:29,404
No!

438
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:31,706
That isn't mine!

439
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,218
That isn't mine!

440
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,487
That isn't mine!

441
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,088
Come on,

442
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:49,357
Come on,

443
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,494
I know you can do it,

444
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:54,696
Get my Yun Hee out,

445
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,533
When did she become "your" Yun Hee?

446
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,736
Since yesterday, She and I love each other,

447
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,873
So she wants to quit going to the Kingdom,

448
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:06,007
Really?

449
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,842
- She says she loves you? - Yes,

450
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:09,344
She wants to quit the Kingdom?

451
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:11,546
- Drop the garbage, - Hey,

452
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,915
Do I look like I'm kidding?

453
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:15,283
No,

454
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:17,519
The future Prime Minister really likes her,

455
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,522
Replace her with someone who looks like her,

456
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:24,059
What if things work out and we get married?

457
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,061
Then things could get awkward,

458
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,133
Will you do it?

459
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,135
Get it together,,,

460
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:35,837
unless you want to get in trouble with him,

461
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:41,176
- Hello, sir, - Did you see,,,

462
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,478
my hole-in-one golf ball in the Kingdom?

463
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:46,147
Where is it?

464
00:32:46,448 --> 00:32:48,516
Where am I supposed to find it?

465
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:51,653
Darn it, Seriously,

466
00:32:52,287 --> 00:32:55,056
Can't he do this himself?

467
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:18,613
Darn it, He took it with him,

468
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,078
(Babe, When do you want to come over?)

469
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,549
No, It's too dangerous,

470
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:57,285
I don't know how long I'll have to wait,,,

471
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,686
if I miss this chance,

472
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:00,422
Should I go with her?

473
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,425
Someone who has been to crime scenes should,,,

474
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:05,193
That's worse,

475
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:09,164
You want to trespass and steal as a team?

476
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,801
It isn't trespassing, He invited her over,

477
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:15,537
We know where the video is,

478
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:17,472
We can't sit back and do nothing,

479
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,974
What if he catches you leaving with the video?

480
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,843
Can you guarantee nothing will go wrong?

481
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,080
Let's look for another way,

482
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:29,751
That's right, I thought about it,

483
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:31,352
and we shouldn't break the law,

484
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,688
Do as she says,

485
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:48,670
There are plenty of ways,,,

486
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,472
to legally use the government's power,

487
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,574
Like what?

488
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,843
Ways that I know well from experience,

489
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:58,780
Give me your number,

490
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,015
Text we when you schedule the date to go over,

491
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:05,620
As I'm sure you could tell,

492
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,022
I work differently from Ms, Min,

493
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:10,692
I like that,

494
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,269
So? Did you look into it?

495
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:23,004
Yes, Jin Yun Hee,

496
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:24,572
Her sister was Jin Sul Hee,

497
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:25,773
who killed herself in 2004,

498
00:35:26,007 --> 00:35:27,108
Okay,

499
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,210
Send me the documents and photos,

500
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,790
(Family Registry: Jin Yun Hee)

501
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,793
(Sibling: Jin Sul Hee, deceased)

502
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,897
A rat sneaked in,

503
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:51,799
I'm sorry, sir, I'll take care of it,

504
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:55,570
No,

505
00:35:57,105 --> 00:35:59,240
Even if she has guts of steel,

506
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:04,479
she wouldn't have come if she were working alone,

507
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:09,484
I'm sure there's someone behind her,

508
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,257
Find out who that is first,

509
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,093
Yes, sir,

510
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,001
- What? - How did it go?

511
00:36:27,468 --> 00:36:28,570
Did you find a replacement?

512
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,305
Darn it, Seriously,

513
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:32,707
You ignored everything I said, didn't you?

514
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:36,010
Get my Yun Hee out quickly,

515
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:38,646
What's your problem?

516
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,350
Stop overreacting, you punk, She,,,

517
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,654
Anyway, she doesn't really like you,

518
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:49,290
How do you know that? Did you meet her?

519
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:52,493
She's so apologetic to me about what she has to do!

520
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:56,097
I really want things to work out with her,

521
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:58,633
Hey! You're my friend, aren't you?

522
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,802
Can't you do this much for me?

523
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,973
You frustrating moron,

524
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:10,011
Did he hang up on me?

525
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,681
I'm losing my mind, Darn it,

526
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:30,898
I hear you're seeing Dong Shik,

527
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,035
I am,

528
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:36,804
He's going crazy about how much he loves you,

529
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:39,841
What about you?

530
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:44,312
Well,,,

531
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:46,614
Stop coming here,

532
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:48,416
What?

533
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:51,686
You can stop servicing the elders,

534
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:54,322
Why?

535
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,691
Did I do something wrong?

536
00:37:57,392 --> 00:37:58,626
That's not it,

537
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,899
Seriously,

538
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:07,168
Dong Shik, that punk,

539
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:10,004
keeps begging me to get you out,

540
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:13,808
You must feel weird doing this while seeing him too,

541
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:21,149
Ignore what Dong Shik says,

542
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,018
It's okay,

543
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:28,723
To be honest, we're not that far along yet,

544
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:31,993
I want,,,

545
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,196
to continue working at the Kingdom,

546
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:38,433
It suits my personality,

547
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:40,868
I like it,

548
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,805
Do you mean it?

549
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,909
Yes, I have no intention of quitting,

550
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:54,349
Fine, Okay,

551
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,017
You may go,

552
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,385
Okay,

553
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,100
Did you hear that?

554
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,836
Love? As if,

555
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:18,373
She's using you, Wake up, punk,

556
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:33,488
Baek Min Ho, come out,

557
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:51,072
Don't tell me you think there's hope, do you?

558
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:56,644
Don't say anything stupid,

559
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,746
and just stay quiet,,,

560
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,416
if you want to stay alive,

561
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:04,385
Okay?

562
00:40:06,387 --> 00:40:07,555
Go,

563
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,098
I'll tell you everything,

564
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,503
If I'll die whether or not I talk,

565
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,238
I should talk,

566
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:27,108
I won't be the only one suffering any longer,

567
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,078
The location where Kong Soo Ah was attacked,

568
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,348
It was not in an ordinary hotel room,

569
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,418
It was in the Kingdom,

570
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:41,856
It's in Hyungjae Hotel, on the K floor,

571
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:46,894
Kingdom?

572
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:49,630
A secret lobbying place that Cho Gap Soo created,

573
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:52,366
That was where the video of Kong Soo Ah,,,

574
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:55,069
was filmed too,

575
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,346
You're sure Choi Yong Woon isn't coming home today?

576
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:09,951
(Yong Woon is going away for work, Come over,)

577
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:11,919
Okay,

578
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:16,457
- What is all of this? - I told you,

579
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:19,327
It's a way to legally use the government's power,

580
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:21,929
Awesome,

581
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:24,999
First,

582
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:26,367
leave them in the bathroom,

583
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,936
And make sure to put one in Choi Yong Woon's room,

584
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:30,972
Okay,

585
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:33,040
I'll call it in after 10 minutes,

586
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,344
Once they're in place, get out of there,

587
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:38,679
I'll say he secretly videoed women,,,

588
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,314
and have the cops search his place,

589
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:41,916
Okay,

590
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:02,403
- I'm here, - Hey, Come in,

591
00:42:02,403 --> 00:42:03,838
Thank you,

592
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,940
May I use the bathroom?

593
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,175
- Sure, That way, - Thanks,

594
00:42:58,659 --> 00:42:59,694
Ms, Min,

595
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:01,762
I'll find the video,

596
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:03,965
I'm with Yi Deum,

597
00:43:12,707 --> 00:43:13,975
- Dong Shik, - Yes?

598
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,844
I'm hungry, Will you make me instant noodles?

599
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,446
Were you hungry?

600
00:43:18,913 --> 00:43:20,448
I'll cook it right away,

601
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:21,515
Thanks,

602
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:38,532
What are you doing?

603
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:41,769
What?

604
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:43,971
Bathroom,

605
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,741
But,,,

606
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,411
you just went to the bathroom,

607
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:55,616
I looked into Jin Yun Hee,

608
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,686
It looks like Min Ji Sook,,,

609
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:01,422
and Ma Yi Deum are working with her,

610
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:03,290
Ma Yi Deum?

611
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:28,849
(Ma Yi Deum, prosecutor)

612
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:36,590
Hey,

613
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:40,094
Did you think I was an idiot?

614
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:42,263
Dong Shik,

615
00:45:03,017 --> 00:45:04,218
Yi Deum!

616
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:18,566
Shoot,

617
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:27,208
They walked in on their own,

618
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,944
so cut off their feet,

619
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,915
Put a weapon on them after you kill them,

620
00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:37,284
Then you can say it was self defense,

621
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:39,587
No one can complain,

622
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:51,565
Ms, Min, I'll find the video,

623
00:45:51,565 --> 00:45:53,167
I'm with Yi Deum,

624
00:45:58,572 --> 00:46:00,508
The phone has been turned off,

625
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,544
Ms, Min,

626
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:05,412
Hyungjae Hotel has a secret,,,

627
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:07,815
Wait, Just a second,

628
00:46:08,783 --> 00:46:11,051
I think something happened to Ma,

629
00:46:19,627 --> 00:46:20,961
I'll go,

630
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:59,567
The phone has been turned off, Please,,,

631
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:27,127
Did you approach me intentionally that night?

632
00:47:29,296 --> 00:47:30,931
They're psychotic,

633
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:32,032
Step aside,

634
00:47:34,535 --> 00:47:35,569
Hey,

635
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:39,106
Why did you come here?

636
00:47:40,341 --> 00:47:42,276
What were you looking for?

637
00:47:42,343 --> 00:47:43,744
You have the video, right?

638
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:44,845
Hand it over,

639
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:46,413
Video?

640
00:47:46,413 --> 00:47:48,716
The one you threatened Cho Gap Soo with,

641
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:50,484
Hand it over,

642
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:54,221
It'll be better for you,,,

643
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:56,156
to hand it over while I'm being nice,

644
00:47:59,894 --> 00:48:01,729
How are you so confident?

645
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:04,231
You should worry about yourself,

646
00:48:04,899 --> 00:48:06,066
Do you think,,,

647
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,769
you guys will walk out of here alive?

648
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:11,205
What? Did you think we'd tremble in fear?

649
00:48:11,372 --> 00:48:14,008
Hey, I was a prosecutor for seven years,

650
00:48:14,008 --> 00:48:16,644
I've seen countless punks like you,

651
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,012
You don't scare me,

652
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:21,916
You should cooperate before the cops come,

653
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:23,918
I called them before I came here,

654
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:25,119
You did?

655
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:27,554
What a little,,,

656
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:30,724
You'll rot in jail if you keep refusing,

657
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,229
See? See? Police! Help!

658
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:37,731
Over here! Here!

659
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,835
- Help! - The police are here,

660
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,604
Make them go away,

661
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:56,850
Is anyone home?

662
00:49:10,664 --> 00:49:12,132
Excuse us,

663
00:49:12,266 --> 00:49:13,667
We received a call,

664
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:17,338
Does either of your number end in 7451?

665
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,408
I called it in, actually,

666
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:23,310
I'm sorry,

667
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,679
It was a prank call,

668
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:26,714
What?

669
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:28,782
He and I were fooling around,

670
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,452
and I called as a prank,

671
00:49:31,452 --> 00:49:33,487
I didn't think you'd really come,

672
00:49:33,988 --> 00:49:35,222
I'm sorry,

673
00:49:35,823 --> 00:49:39,193
You should know better, You shouldn't do this,

674
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:41,295
Because of pranks by people like you,

675
00:49:41,295 --> 00:49:42,863
those who really need help,,,

676
00:49:42,863 --> 00:49:45,699
lose their chance to get help, Do you understand?

677
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:46,734
Yes, sir,

678
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:48,569
I'm sorry,

679
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,637
Don't do this again,

680
00:49:50,871 --> 00:49:51,939
I'm sorry,

681
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,443
Wait,

682
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,421
I'm sorry for wasting your time,

683
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:16,090
It'll never happen again,

684
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:17,591
Have a good night,

685
00:51:18,058 --> 00:51:19,793
- Please be careful, - Yes, sir,

686
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:24,698
Get inside,

687
00:51:29,036 --> 00:51:30,204
Just a minute,

688
00:51:32,873 --> 00:51:34,775
- I'm a prosecutor, - Yes, sir,

689
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,944
- We must search there, - Pardon?

690
00:51:36,944 --> 00:51:39,480
An abducted woman is in there, Please hurry,

691
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,015
- Abducted? - Yes, sir,

692
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,821
Come in,

693
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:03,137
Let go!

694
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,571
Let go!

695
00:52:05,139 --> 00:52:06,373
Let go!

696
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,512
Let go!

697
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,713
- Darn it, - Yi Deum,

698
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,448
- Let go! - Yi Deum!

699
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:22,656
Let go of me, Let go,

700
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,193
- Ms, Ma, - Choi Yong Woon,

701
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:28,629
Get Choi Yong Woon first, He has the video,

702
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,897
Hurry,

703
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:06,166
Darn it,

704
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,752
Sorry, I didn't think it through,

705
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,488
Shoot, Seriously,

706
00:54:05,726 --> 00:54:06,793
Hold on,

707
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:11,398
What about the video? Is it in there?

708
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:16,970
Ms, Ma,

709
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:23,677
Why are you so reckless?

710
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,313
What if something worse had happened?

711
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,649
You should've told me at least!

712
00:54:29,216 --> 00:54:32,085
Why are you getting so angry?

713
00:54:32,452 --> 00:54:33,787
I'm sorry,

714
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:35,822
I was wrong, I mean it,

715
00:54:36,223 --> 00:54:38,392
That's why I came like this,

716
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:44,364
Worry about yourself, Look, You're hurt,

717
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:46,767
It hurts, right?

718
00:54:50,304 --> 00:54:51,705
Are you okay?

719
00:54:52,306 --> 00:54:53,607
It hurts,

720
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:55,742
Seriously,

721
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:00,981
(Attorney at Law, Min Ji Sook)

722
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:39,853
(Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office)

723
00:55:42,322 --> 00:55:43,890
The defendant insisted,,,

724
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:47,127
that Baek Min Ho murdered Kong Soo Ah,

725
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,795
and submitted a glove,,,

726
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:50,430
with Baek Min Ho's blood as evidence,

727
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,800
Jung Young Ho of NFS, who analyzed the blood,

728
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:55,402
submitted this written statement,

729
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:04,211
He states that no such evidence existed,

730
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,614
and that he forged it per Ahn Tae Kyoo's request,

731
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,819
It proves he concealed his own crime,,,

732
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:17,391
and that he was the real murderer,

733
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:20,193
Defense, Do you have anything to say?

734
00:56:21,395 --> 00:56:22,763
I'd like to submit,,,

735
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,799
Lee Sang Joon's letter of resignation from NFS,

736
00:56:34,508 --> 00:56:37,277
Why are you submitting this?

737
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:41,548
He was the NFS technician who analyzed the glove,,,

738
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:43,650
the prosecution submitted into evidence,

739
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:46,887
He was fired for embezzlement,

740
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:51,858
If we accept the assertion that the glove evidence,,,

741
00:56:51,858 --> 00:56:54,060
was forged as per Ahn Tae Kyoo's orders,

742
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,130
we must also question,,,

743
00:56:57,264 --> 00:57:00,534
the glove the prosecution submitted,

744
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,005
(Letter of Resignation)

745
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,344
Both pieces of evidence the parties submitted,,,

746
00:57:11,878 --> 00:57:14,114
lack credibility, and thus,

747
00:57:14,815 --> 00:57:17,784
we will exclude both from consideration,

748
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,853
Prosecution,

749
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,389
Do you have any other evidence?

750
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:27,160
The trial is over,

751
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:28,962
Let's go,

752
00:57:56,289 --> 00:57:57,424
Your Honor,

753
00:57:58,024 --> 00:58:00,227
I'm the defendant Baek Min Ho's new counsel,

754
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:02,462
Ma Yi Deum,

755
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,924
(Witch's Court)

756
00:58:31,024 --> 00:58:33,793
I submit a video of Ahn Tae Kyoo assaulting,,,

757
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:35,128
the victim into evidence,

758
00:58:35,128 --> 00:58:37,697
We need to silence the prosecutor first,

759
00:58:37,697 --> 00:58:39,065
He caught us off guard,

760
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:40,300
Three months of suspension?

761
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,636
We decided to go to Bujin,

762
00:58:43,069 --> 00:58:44,504
Is this for me, Mom?

763
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:47,140
Something necessitating a special investigation,

764
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,175
We need Baek Sang Ho's journal then,

765
00:58:49,242 --> 00:58:51,378
This calls for a fatal blow,

766
00:58:51,578 --> 00:58:53,947
Evidence regarding Baek Sang Ho's suicide?

767
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,282
Team up with us,

768
00:58:57,217 --> 00:58:59,686
Let's catch Cho Gap Soo,
