1
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,108
It scares us, just thinking about it.

2
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,586
When you hear it
you're gonna think we're insane.

3
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:01,319
It started out small.

4
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:04,778
Like a leg or a hand
was in a different position and...

5
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:07,490
And it's head was looking up
instead of down and...

6
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:10,994
Then one day
it was in a completely different room.

7
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,052
It's moving around by itself.

8
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,853
Camilla got in touch with a medium.

9
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,042
We learned from her
that the doll was possessed

10
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:22,094
by a girl named
Annabelle Higgins.

11
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:25,375
She had lost her parents
and had taken a liking to my doll.

12
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,794
All she wanted was to be friends.

13
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:30,332
When we heard this
we felt really sorry for her, I mean...

14
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,824
We're nurses.
We help people.

15
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:34,633
But then...

16
00:01:34,658 --> 00:01:36,352
Things got worse.

17
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:39,715
How did you end up with it?

18
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,315
It was a gift from my mom,
for my birthday.

19
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:45,279
I don't know where she got it.

20
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:46,430
But...

21
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:48,965
We are beyond terrified.

22
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:24,543
God honour sacrifice.

23
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:30,133
And our sacrifices touch god's heart.

24
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:31,994
And move his hand.

25
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,915
Jesus said: This is my commandment.

26
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,462
That you love one another
as I have loved you.

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,328
Greater love hath no-one than this.

28
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:47,924
That he lay down his life for his friends.

29
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,939
Let us pray.

30
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:01,217
Good to see you too.

31
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:02,509
See you soon.

32
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:05,493
Hey you!

33
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,535
Ok. So eh...

34
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:11,986
Who won?

35
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:14,241
John.
But he cheats.

36
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:16,408
What? I Ehh..
It was two against one.

37
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,880
I had to do something, right?

38
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,354
Yeah Right!

39
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:24,201
Where did Sharon get off to?

40
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:25,838
We'll find her.

41
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:27,106
Thanks.

42
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:28,249
Bye.

43
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:49,150
Pete send you after me?

44
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,297
I swear, one day he thinks I'll just...

45
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:58,591
run off too.

46
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:03,987
Men!

47
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,255
What would they be without us?
I mean honestly.

48
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:29,809
We appreciate the last speech.

49
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:30,817
Sure thing.

50
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:33,027
You just make sure to take care
of this wife and baby for us.

51
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:35,427
Did we ask about names yet?

52
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:36,877
Sharon!
- What?!

53
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,061
It's not prying.
It's just conversation.

54
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:40,667
We're still working on them anyway.

55
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:42,812
But we're pretty sure...
John, if it's a boy.

56
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:44,524
And we're thinking Phyllis if it's a girl.

57
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,813
We were?
Yeah. You said you liked it.

58
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,744
He, I never said that.

59
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:50,165
It's my grandmother's name.

60
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,033
And I can't stand your grandmother.

61
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,319
Oh dear.

62
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,941
It's not only me.
I mean nobody can stand her.

63
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,666
No, she's right.
Everyone hates her.

64
00:04:58,327 --> 00:04:59,343
Ok. Well...

65
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,912
On that note Sharon.

66
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:01,849
Let's go inside.

67
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:03,781
These two, they have a lot to talk about.

68
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:05,522
Thank you and...

69
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,028
think nothing of it.

70
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:08,781
Just remember...

71
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:10,819
children are a blessing.

72
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,167
Indeed they are.

73
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:13,836
And then they learn to talk.

74
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,770
I guess that's a no on Phyllis?

75
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:26,310
We shouldn't talk about the baby so much,
in front of them.

76
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:27,708
It just aint right.

77
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:29,085
Why not?

78
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:32,239
Well, they only lost their daughter
two years ago.

79
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,596
Loose their daughter? Mia?

80
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,004
She ran away
and joined up with the hippies.

81
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:39,662
By now she's probably got three husbands
and calls herself Star.

82
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:42,759
Well...
Even Star

83
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:45,216
is a better name than Phyllis.

84
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:49,492
Oh. You.. you didn't lock it?

85
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,069
No. Why would I?

86
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:53,210
You have to start locking it John.
I mean it's...

87
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:54,517
it's a different world now.

88
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:59,311
<i>They call themselves "The Family".</i>

89
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:02,949
<i>But police officials
have labelled them a dangerous cult</i>

90
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:05,343
<i>residing on the grounds of Spahn Ranch.</i>

91
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:08,908
<i>Once used as the backdrop
for many well-known westerns.</i>

92
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:12,332
<i>The Family is estimated to have
close to thirty gatherers</i>

93
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:14,819
<i>Many of them with histories
of heavy drug use</i>

94
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:16,616
<i>and criminal behaviour.</i>

95
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,747
<i>...are in custody awaiting charges</i>

96
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:23,362
<i>for the brutal Tate and LaBianca murders.</i>

97
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:26,004
<i>They held Los Angeles in the grip of fear</i>

98
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:29,156
<i>before police investigators
were led to the suspects...</i>

99
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,308
Hey Honey?!

100
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,190
Do you think you could shut off the TV?

101
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:34,008
It's making it a little hard
to concentrate.

102
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:37,167
<i>...their leader, Charles Manson,
was sometimes referred to</i>

103
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:40,795
<i>as both God and Satan,
by his devoted followers.</i>

104
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,202
And had predicted an
Armageddon like event he called...

105
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:45,652
<i>Helter Skelter.</i>

106
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,278
Thank you!

107
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:55,589
Hey, you know. You shouldn't even
be watching that stuff.

108
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,292
Alright. It could upset the baby.

109
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,705
There's new research out there...

110
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,840
Oh boy! More new research?
- It's true!

111
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,163
They are learning that the babies in utero

112
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:06,127
experience more of the outside world
than they ever thought possible.

113
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:09,576
They recognize voices
and noises. Songs.

114
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,686
You know, I bet the man
that did that research

115
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:13,419
spent millions of dollars

116
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:15,782
when they could have just
asked the mother for free.

117
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,751
How's it going in here?

118
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:22,363
Ehhm... Well...

119
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,080
I am trying my hardest to enjoy it.

120
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:29,153
Everyone keeps telling me that..

121
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:32,105
Once you're in the residency
it gets a million times worse.

122
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:35,772
Haven't even mentioned the fact
that I'm about to be a new father.

123
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:36,703
Why not?

124
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:38,798
I don't know.

125
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:41,801
Sometimes you just don't
wanna hear how.. difficult

126
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,244
it's gonna be.

127
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:44,694
Difficult?

128
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:48,112
You know. Maybe difficult's
not the right word.

129
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:50,406
Challenging.

130
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,327
Are you talking about the residency

131
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,089
or me and the baby.

132
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,431
I don't know.

133
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:04,033
All of it I guess.
I mean...

134
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:05,930
It's not like this is an ideal situation

135
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:08,156
for what I'm about to go through.

136
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:12,448
I.. We.. We're about
to go through.

137
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:32,572
I didn't mean for that
to sound like it did.

138
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:33,631
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:35,676
It's not like...

140
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:38,852
difficult or challenging
or bad things anyway.

141
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:41,454
Look..

142
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:43,478
I know that I've been a little...

143
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:47,104
caught up in my own world lately.
Some people might call it self centered.

144
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,294
Some people?

145
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,201
Most people.

146
00:08:50,415 --> 00:08:51,555
Everyone.

147
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:56,021
Can we just go back
and redo the last two minutes, please?

148
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,650
Please?

149
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:07,479
It's fine.

150
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:11,093
I know you were stressed.

151
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,846
I'm just a little.. Ehh...

152
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:15,749
over sensitive lately.

153
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:16,911
Yeah...

154
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:20,008
Do you want me to tell you why?

155
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:21,918
Yes Doctor!

156
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:24,289
In my Ehm...

157
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,671
almost.. expert opinion

158
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:29,072
you are a little sensitive

159
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,239
because you are a lot pregnant.

160
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:36,089
Hey I'm sorry.
I mean... I am...

161
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,652
Yes, I'm.. I'm stressed about
finishing med-school

162
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:41,875
and I'm freaking out about matching but...

163
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:44,785
I've never been happier.

164
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:46,596
Ever.

165
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,986
Ok? And that's because of you.

166
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:55,671
And it.

167
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,714
You know what?

168
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:04,009
There's something I wanna give you.

169
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,503
Oh no. The last time you said that
I ended up pregnant

170
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:09,073
Yes you did.

171
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:26,246
Ok. Close your eyes.

172
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:33,790
I was waiting on this
until the baby, but...

173
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:35,558
You were feeling a little...

174
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,441
Guilty, yes.
Because of what I said.

175
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:38,270
Ok.

176
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:39,953
Open your eyes.

177
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:44,214
You didn't...

178
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,860
My god John.

179
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:02,989
That's the one right?

180
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:04,133
Yes.

181
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,418
Where did you find her?
I mean...

182
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,435
Do you know how long I've been looking?
- I know.

183
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,915
I had completely lost hope.

184
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,797
Oh, I have my ways.

185
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,055
We'll be a little short on the rent
the next few of months, but eh...

186
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:43,391
There.
She fits right in.

187
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,959
That completes the set-up, right?

188
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:47,951
Yes. It does.

189
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:50,111
Thank you.
I love her.

190
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:01,624
John?

191
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,635
John. Wake up.

192
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,858
What is it? The baby?

193
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,869
No no. Next door..
I heard a scream.

194
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:10,468
I.. I think something's wrong.

195
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,784
Stay here.
I'm gonna check it out.

196
00:13:27,235 --> 00:13:28,776
John. Wait.

197
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:30,817
Shouldn't we call the cops?

198
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,402
Because you think you heard a scream?

199
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,360
Just let me go check it out.
They'd do the same for us.

200
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:37,961
If they heard me scream,
I'd rather they call the cops.

201
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:40,024
<i>Think</i> they heard you scream.

202
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,566
Just be careful.

203
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:43,895
I will.

204
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:31,715
John?

205
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:52,376
Oh my god!
You're covered in blood.

206
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:54,852
It's not mine. Go back inside
and call an ambulance right now.

207
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:55,758
Go!

208
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:20,851
911 operator.

209
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:22,755
I need.. I need an ambulance.

210
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:24,633
What's your location?

211
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:27,105
307 Gardener Road.

212
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:29,186
Yes.

213
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:30,900
What's your emergency?

214
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:32,271
I.. I don't know.
But..

215
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:35,999
There's a lot of blood.

216
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:40,144
Please. Just be as fast as possible.

217
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:11,742
I like your dolls.

218
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:17,936
My.. My husband's coming back.

219
00:16:19,402 --> 00:16:20,389
Just..Just...

220
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,498
Take whatever you want.
Just.. Just get out.

221
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,096
Get out.
Get out of here.

222
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:34,254
<i>Open up!</i>

223
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:41,408
<i>Open up! It's the police!</i>

224
00:17:41,535 --> 00:17:43,119
<i>Open the door!</i>

225
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:59,866
You're alright.
We got you.

226
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:02,672
I'm right here.
I'm right here with you.

227
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:43,213
In a tragic scene,
described by one investigator

228
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:46,142
as reminiscent of a horrific cult ritual.

229
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:48,764
A man and his wife
was brutally stabbed to death

230
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:51,165
by their estranged daughter,
Annabelle Higgins.

231
00:18:51,189 --> 00:18:53,259
And her unidentified boyfriend.

232
00:18:53,284 --> 00:18:55,422
The two are believed
to be members of a cult.

233
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:59,368
The male suspect was shot and killed
as police arrived on scene.

234
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:02,088
While the daughter was found
in an apparent suicide

235
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,899
her throat slit open.

236
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,925
One officer summed up these blood
soaked murders by saying:

237
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:09,827
In all my years I have never seen anything

238
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:11,624
quite as gruesome as this.

239
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:18,649
Damn well the amniotic sac

240
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:20,133
wasn't punctured.

241
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:21,731
And isn't ruptured.

242
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:25,624
We are seeing signs of strain

243
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:28,060
on the cervix.

244
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:30,384
Most likely caused by the trauma.

245
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,483
Which is why..

246
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:36,300
I am putting you on bed rest
for the remainder of your pregnancy.

247
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:37,444
Now..

248
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:40,960
You can get up and use the facilities.

249
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:44,253
If you do so delicately.

250
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:49,106
But anything beyond that would
be putting you and your child at risk.

251
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:50,415
Alright?

252
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:52,183
Thank you.
- Ok.

253
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:10,976
The lock!

254
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:27,239
I had them scrub everything.
At least twice.

255
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:30,644
You can perform surgery in there.
It's so clean.

256
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,647
You didn't have to do that.

257
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:52,872
You're on bed rest for a while.
You'd go crazy if I didn't.

258
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:57,076
Just.. Don't get all obsessed
with those daytime soaps.

259
00:20:57,435 --> 00:20:59,168
You know I can't stand them.

260
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:01,661
I'll bring your sewing back in later on.

261
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:03,920
Ok? We can turn the whole room into your

262
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:05,480
own little sweatshop.

263
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,286
What is it?

264
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,790
You think the baby is Ok?

265
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:19,318
The baby is not even aware
of what happened.

266
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:22,610
Oh really? Because I heard there's some new
research that Ehm.. you know.

267
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:24,067
Oh yeah.

268
00:21:25,124 --> 00:21:26,687
You heard the doctors.

269
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:28,874
So if you listen to them
the baby is fine.

270
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,635
The baby <i>is</i> fine.

271
00:21:31,705 --> 00:21:33,047
You're its mother, right?

272
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,925
If it wasn't you would know.

273
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:39,453
What if something does happen?

274
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,037
What?

275
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:43,576
What's gonna happen? When...
Like when I go into labor, John.

276
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,330
Yeah.

277
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:49,928
You'll save the baby over me?

278
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:51,692
Come on.

279
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:53,301
We have to talk about it.

280
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:59,350
I mean, I can't have it.
If anything ever happened to it.

281
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,957
Hey, promise me.

282
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:08,265
You promise me you'll save the baby.

283
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,051
Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:22:13,076 --> 00:22:14,522
I promise.

285
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:15,955
But you know what?

286
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:17,525
It's gonna be okay.

287
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:18,897
You are gonna be fine

288
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:04,945
What the hell is that?

289
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:10,071
John!

290
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:19,411
John?

291
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:20,528
It's okay.

292
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,159
<i>I'm your friend.
You know that, don't you?</i>

293
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:14,620
<i>Are you Phil?</i>

294
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:16,424
<I>Of course I am.</I>

295
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:20,925
<i>Well, then I have a friend.</i>

296
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:22,598
<i>You have been...</i>

297
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,008
<i>...after dinner...</i>

298
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:27,672
<i>even dancing.</i>

299
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:22,722
How'd it go today?

300
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,388
Eh. TV went out again.

301
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:25,897
Really?

302
00:26:25,922 --> 00:26:28,128
Must be that room.
It never did that in the den.

303
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,354
What is all that?

304
00:26:31,816 --> 00:26:34,976
Ehh..This is a bunch of random stuff
that I picked up at the store.

305
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,827
To satisfy any pregnancy cravings.

306
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:39,405
That's funny.
I haven't really

307
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:41,130
had any cravings.

308
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,321
Ohh! Pickles.

309
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:47,498
Oh my god. You know what would go
really well with Pickles?

310
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:52,355
John Gordon. We are meant to be together.

311
00:26:53,089 --> 00:26:54,240
Yeah. I know.

312
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:56,207
Like eh.. Mustard and Pickles.

313
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,995
Did you have that big meeting today?

314
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:04,288
Yeah. I did.

315
00:27:04,902 --> 00:27:07,913
He eh.. thinks I've got a real shot
at Huntington memorial.

316
00:27:09,937 --> 00:27:11,023
Of course you do.

317
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:13,271
It's in Pasadena though.

318
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:15,339
So further from the beach.
Okay with that?

319
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:19,361
Change of view would be good.

320
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:21,952
Yeah.

321
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:24,934
There's this one day conference
in Sacramento

322
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,434
that he thinks I should attend.

323
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:28,707
That eh.. could help move things
in that direction.

324
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,481
Fly up for a day in a few days.

325
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,111
Only a couple of days?

326
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:37,334
I'll be fine.

327
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,343
We gotta get you back to bed.

328
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,126
You shouldn't be sitting up this long.

329
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,114
Oh! And Detective Clarkin called today.

330
00:27:46,139 --> 00:27:48,220
Said he wanted to stop by
at some point this week.

331
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,564
I've already told him everything.

332
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:53,030
I.. I'd rather just forget the whole thing.

333
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:55,410
I know. He just said he wanted
to go over a few things.

334
00:27:58,312 --> 00:27:59,555
The doll.

335
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:02,320
We need to get rid of it.

336
00:28:02,345 --> 00:28:04,219
I mean, she had it in her hands.

337
00:28:04,612 --> 00:28:06,416
No. You're right.
You're right.

338
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:08,632
Just Ehm.. Consider it gone.

339
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:12,611
I suppose you can tell Detective Clarkin
he can stop by whenever's convenient.

340
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:17,099
It's not like I'm going anywhere
anytime soon.

341
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:52,567
They were members of a cult.

342
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:57,162
We've confirmed
that it was Higgins daughter.

343
00:28:57,187 --> 00:28:58,837
And her boyfriend.

344
00:28:59,816 --> 00:29:01,307
You may have heard on the news...

345
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:03,049
That cults are taking over the world.

346
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:06,589
It's not quite as prevalent
as they'd have you believe.

347
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:08,990
You're gonna have a hard time
convincing us of that.

348
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:16,006
Were they satanic?

349
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,523
It's okay.
She should know.

350
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,328
Yes.

351
00:29:23,187 --> 00:29:26,100
Yes it is. It is believed
they had interest in the occult.

352
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,137
That they did this to prove their devotion.

353
00:29:29,205 --> 00:29:31,900
A sort of..
Violence for violence's sake.

354
00:29:32,183 --> 00:29:33,931
But that's crazy.

355
00:29:36,388 --> 00:29:39,470
Crazy people do crazy things, Ma'am.

356
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:42,732
But that's all this was.

357
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:46,908
I tell you what.

358
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:49,712
I'll dig a little deeper.

359
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,666
See what I can find.

360
00:29:51,944 --> 00:29:53,634
But if I come up with anything further,

361
00:29:53,744 --> 00:29:55,356
I'll reach anoth...
- No!

362
00:29:57,366 --> 00:29:58,332
Thank you.

363
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:02,201
But Ehm.. Unless it has something
to do with our safety, I...

364
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:06,448
I'd rather not hear any more about it.

365
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:08,671
Okay.

366
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:10,524
I understand.

367
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:16,210
Okay.

368
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:18,150
Hold it right,
right, right there.

369
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,131
Thank you.

370
00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:22,768
I'm making popcorn.

371
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,790
Are you sure it's okay for the baby
to have this much butter and s...

372
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,245
How are you feeling?

373
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,772
Well, nervous.

374
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:09,417
They are gonna love you.

375
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,356
I love <i>you</i>.

376
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,796
I love you too.

377
00:33:41,174 --> 00:33:42,651
I got you. I got you.

378
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:58,106
Hey.

379
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,071
Hi.

380
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:04,546
I'm so sorry that I wasn't here.

381
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,151
I'm so sorry.

382
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:07,905
Behind you.

383
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,096
Congratulations.

384
00:34:16,126 --> 00:34:17,142
It's a girl.

385
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,676
This is my baby.

386
00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:20,822
Oh my gosh.

387
00:34:25,974 --> 00:34:26,954
Leah?

388
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:28,978
Leah.

389
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:30,022
Hi.

390
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,467
Hi Leah. It's your daddy.

391
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:36,075
Look at her.

392
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,758
Look at her.

393
00:34:41,504 --> 00:34:42,640
John.

394
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:45,867
John. The fire.

395
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:46,904
Oh, Shh shh.

396
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:49,824
It's fine. She's fine. You're fine.

397
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,638
I don't know what happened.

398
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:56,484
It's like the house is cursed.

399
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:00,326
I can never go back there again.

400
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,115
I can't. Not with her now.

401
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:04,819
You don't have to.

402
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:06,424
Ever.

403
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:11,007
Hey honey.
You all set?

404
00:36:11,512 --> 00:36:12,798
Any second now...

405
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:14,950
She's gonna...

406
00:36:18,987 --> 00:36:20,265
And then...

407
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:23,603
You need to get out more.
Come on.

408
00:36:23,908 --> 00:36:25,428
We'll be late.

409
00:36:26,025 --> 00:36:27,439
You really think we should go?

410
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:29,564
I mean, Leah's being a little fuzzy.

411
00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:31,233
Mia. She's fine.

412
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:34,480
Okay. You both need to get out of here.
You've been cooped up in here too much.

413
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,973
I know, but it's...

414
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:39,215
Look look. Get outta here.
It's beautiful. Okay?

415
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,457
Come on. You need this.
I need this. Leah...

416
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:43,496
She could definitely use some color.

417
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:45,046
Stop it.

418
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:47,249
Put some of that eh..
What do you call it?

419
00:36:47,312 --> 00:36:48,833
Oh Cocoa Butter Milk.

420
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,896
We should just slap her with some
Cocoa Butter.

421
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:53,219
Okay okay, I will go

422
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,788
as long as you stop talking.

423
00:36:56,835 --> 00:36:57,991
We promise.

424
00:36:58,272 --> 00:36:59,647
Let's go.
- Come on

425
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:15,672
We cannot let fear control us.

426
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:19,209
For we are never truly alone

427
00:37:19,234 --> 00:37:21,037
when we walk with God.

428
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:24,337
Isn't it true that the more we know
about something

429
00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:26,471
the less fear we have from it?

430
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,753
We need to face our fears

431
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:31,944
to better understand them.

432
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:38,851
We need to shine a bright light...

433
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:41,601
on the monsters that feed

434
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:44,952
on our insecurities, on our anxieties.

435
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:48,113
And on the doubt
that we cast on ourselves.

436
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,967
We need to remember
that for those who have faith

437
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:55,324
this life of truth is everlasting.

438
00:37:58,627 --> 00:37:59,791
Mia.

439
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:01,877
Mind if I take a picture
of your little one?

440
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:05,233
I like hang photos of the newest
members of the congregation

441
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:07,046
on the visitors bulletin board.

442
00:38:07,071 --> 00:38:08,337
Ah, yes.

443
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:09,415
Sure. Of course.

444
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,587
No no no.
Hold her on your lap.

445
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,218
Oh, you don't need me in the photo.

446
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:15,726
Of course I do...

447
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,483
Mothers are closer to God
than any other living creature.

448
00:38:19,336 --> 00:38:22,211
For only they can share
in God's creative miracle.

449
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,996
Uno, dos, tres.

450
00:38:29,596 --> 00:38:30,784
Wonderful.

451
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:32,353
That should do it.

452
00:38:34,883 --> 00:38:38,075
I still feel the Higgins' absence,
every Sunday.

453
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:41,581
I imagine it must be dif...

454
00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:43,871
Oh, there's...
There's John. I should go.

455
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:47,028
We still have a lot of boxes to unpack.

456
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:49,114
Well, unfortunately I...

457
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:51,442
I don't have a prayer
to help you with that.

458
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:53,753
Well I

459
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:56,409
guess there are some things
we need to take care of ourselves.

460
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:57,894
Yes.

461
00:38:58,691 --> 00:38:59,855
Goodbye.

462
00:39:04,795 --> 00:39:05,944
Father Perez.

463
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:27,013
I think this is the last of them.

464
00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:29,967
Somebody pop the Champagne.

465
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:35,709
I'll get her.

466
00:40:10,448 --> 00:40:13,203
Wait a sec. How'd that get in there?
I swear I threw it out.

467
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:15,721
I don't know.

468
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:18,682
Things must have gotten mixed up
after the fire.

469
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:21,233
Here.. Give her to me.

470
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:23,906
No.

471
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:24,953
No.

472
00:40:26,195 --> 00:40:28,570
You gave her to me as a gift.

473
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:31,727
Like Father Perez said,
we should celebrate our strength, right?

474
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:34,774
You sure?

475
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,569
Yeah.

476
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,627
There. She fits right in.

477
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,453
General Hospital:

478
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:27,001
Where doctors and nurses
dedicate their lives

479
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,442
to that wonder which
is a human being.

480
00:42:10,463 --> 00:42:12,895
That ever changing challenge
of love and hope.

481
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,780
Loneliness and despair.

482
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:17,631
General Hospital.
On ABC.

483
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,791
Doctors and nurses with first names
and last names

484
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:24,799
and tragedies of their own.

485
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,586
Uh!

486
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:33,220
Oh.. I'm so sorry.

487
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:36,290
Oh sorry.
Thank you.

488
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:41,365
Hi.

489
00:42:42,317 --> 00:42:43,755
Do you live here too?

490
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:46,447
We live in...
- Don't tell her.

491
00:42:46,993 --> 00:42:48,674
Were not supposed to tell.

492
00:42:48,938 --> 00:42:50,297
She's a stranger.

493
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:53,282
That's a very good rule to have.

494
00:42:54,024 --> 00:42:55,758
I like your doll.

495
00:42:56,126 --> 00:42:57,758
I have one just like it.

496
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,946
You too?

497
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:01,194
A few actually.

498
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,483
I'm Mia and this is Leah.

499
00:43:07,691 --> 00:43:09,949
Yeah.
What's your name?

500
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,951
It's Nan...
I said don't tell her!

501
00:43:18,477 --> 00:43:19,774
Well...

502
00:43:19,938 --> 00:43:22,352
Maybe one day we can all be friends.

503
00:44:05,724 --> 00:44:06,755
Hey.

504
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,773
You're the new tenants at the
Palmyra, aren't you?

505
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:10,875
Yes.

506
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:14,832
I suppose this little one is
pretty much new to everything?

507
00:44:15,098 --> 00:44:16,294
This is Leah.

508
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:18,773
She's adorable.

509
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,711
I.. I'm Mia.

510
00:44:20,764 --> 00:44:22,053
Evelyn.. Hi.

511
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,678
Here.

512
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,811
This is my daughters favorite.

513
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:29,045
Maybe Leah will like it too
when she's a little older.

514
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,459
That's very sweet.

515
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:33,624
Thank you.

516
00:44:34,189 --> 00:44:36,445
Well, feel free to stop by any time.

517
00:44:36,846 --> 00:44:37,869
Thank you.

518
00:44:56,835 --> 00:44:57,773
Hey.

519
00:45:02,334 --> 00:45:04,678
Look what they drew for you.

520
00:45:04,928 --> 00:45:06,855
See? That's us.

521
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:09,512
Making friends already.

522
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:15,481
I guess we're getting a little exercise.

523
00:45:16,973 --> 00:45:18,450
Look at this.

524
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:10,245
Should we ehh..
Talk to their parents?

525
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:14,087
If Leah did something like this I..
I would wanna know about it.

526
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:15,463
Leah would never do anything like this.

527
00:46:15,535 --> 00:46:17,714
This isn't even good. I mean..
Look at the proportions.

528
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:18,808
Ohh John!

529
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,928
Yes Mia. If she did
I would wanna know too.

530
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:24,095
Okay? So lets go...

531
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,837
Find out where they live.
Introduce ourselves.

532
00:46:25,862 --> 00:46:28,071
But let's not make a big deal
outta this, Okay?

533
00:46:28,414 --> 00:46:29,922
It's not like this is a threat or anything.

534
00:46:29,947 --> 00:46:32,954
It's just one kid
with an overactive imagination.

535
00:46:33,243 --> 00:46:34,970
I know. I.. I know.
I know.

536
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:38,595
You gotta remember that we moved here
to get away from what happened.

537
00:46:39,118 --> 00:46:42,305
We packed up our clothes.
We.. We packed up our furniture.

538
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:45,027
We packed up the good memories.
But the fears...?

539
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:47,484
And the anxieties?
We promised to leave those behind.

540
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:49,918
It is not as easy as it sounds, John.

541
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,966
You're off at work, honey.
Adult conversation and I'm.. here..

542
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:57,373
Working yourself up over nothing.

543
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:04,929
Look.. I'm sorry...

544
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:06,914
Okay. You know what?

545
00:47:09,004 --> 00:47:10,121
Tomorrow night.

546
00:47:10,146 --> 00:47:12,074
I don't have to work late, okay, so...

547
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:15,082
I say I come home.
We sit down.

548
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:17,159
We have a nice dinner.

549
00:47:17,184 --> 00:47:19,854
And we have some...
Adult conversation.

550
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:21,982
Okay?

551
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,484
Can we do that?

552
00:47:28,966 --> 00:47:34,993
<i>Cherish is the word I use to describe</i>

553
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:42,827
<i>All the feeling that I have
Hiding here for you inside</i>

554
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:49,704
<i>You don't know how many times
I've wished that I had told you</i>

555
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:54,056
<i>You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could hold you</i>

556
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:57,143
<i>You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could</i>

557
00:47:57,167 --> 00:48:02,784
<i>Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I</i>

558
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:05,792
<i>Cherish you.</i>

559
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:32,621
<i>Oh, I'm beginning to think</i>

560
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:34,744
<i>that man has never found</i>

561
00:48:34,769 --> 00:48:37,431
<i>The words that would make you wa...</i>

562
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:10,636
Oh God..

563
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:24,750
Hello?!

564
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:49,087
Who are you?

565
00:50:18,871 --> 00:50:20,168
There isn't anyone here.

566
00:50:20,193 --> 00:50:21,723
It's just you and me and Leah.

567
00:50:21,748 --> 00:50:23,559
I know what I saw.

568
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:25,199
It was her.
- Mia...

569
00:50:25,753 --> 00:50:27,659
There are things happening that I..
That I...

570
00:50:27,684 --> 00:50:29,073
That I can't explain.

571
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:30,440
What things?

572
00:50:31,001 --> 00:50:34,759
Baby..Are.. Are you sure they're not just
manifestations of your anxiety?

573
00:50:34,815 --> 00:50:37,463
I'm.. It's perfectly normal
for new mothers to experience

574
00:50:37,488 --> 00:50:39,112
postpartum..
- You know that being a doctor

575
00:50:39,137 --> 00:50:41,034
doesn't make you an expert
on everything, right?

576
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:55,064
I think we should talk to someone.

577
00:50:58,245 --> 00:50:59,526
Like who?

578
00:51:01,315 --> 00:51:02,518
A shrink?

579
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:07,644
I'm not crazy John.

580
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:08,777
I'm not crazy

581
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:10,379
I'm not saying that you're crazy, okay?

582
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:12,402
And I'm not talking about a shrink.

583
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:18,400
So we turn to the church, Father.

584
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:20,838
It's what my parents did when they...

585
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,652
hit a rough patch.

586
00:51:22,855 --> 00:51:24,394
And it worked for them.

587
00:51:25,135 --> 00:51:26,651
I understand of course.

588
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,009
But you two hit more
than just a rough patch.

589
00:51:32,304 --> 00:51:36,148
In a matter of months you've
experienced the very worst of life...

590
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,781
And the very best.

591
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,068
A pendulum swing like that.

592
00:51:42,093 --> 00:51:44,522
It's enough to shake
even the strongest foundations.

593
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,857
But you survived.

594
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:50,186
And instead of trying to forget
this bad history...

595
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:52,123
I think you should use it

596
00:51:52,148 --> 00:51:55,508
as an example of how strong
you two can be when united.

597
00:51:57,051 --> 00:52:00,653
You don't come out the other side,
of something like this, weaker.

598
00:52:00,678 --> 00:52:02,396
You come out stronger.

599
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:09,057
You're right.

600
00:52:13,379 --> 00:52:14,512
Good.

601
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,670
Hi!
- Ohh, Hi.

602
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,545
Mia, right?
- Yes.

603
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:26,360
And of course I remember Leah.

604
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:27,841
You are...?

605
00:52:28,075 --> 00:52:29,310
Hi. John.
- Hi.

606
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:31,890
This is Evelyn Jones.
From the bookstore I was telling you about.

607
00:52:31,976 --> 00:52:33,538
All right, yeah yeah...
Thank you for the book.

608
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:35,202
I couldn't help myself.

609
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:37,935
I saw your girls and I...

610
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,928
I felt like I had known them a long time.

611
00:52:40,781 --> 00:52:43,672
So! Where's this beautiful family off to?

612
00:52:44,103 --> 00:52:46,353
Oh, they're just...
- I have to get to the hospital.

613
00:52:46,378 --> 00:52:49,181
They put me on the night shift.
- I think he did something terrible.

614
00:52:49,206 --> 00:52:51,264
They say that I'm being rewarded.

615
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:54,545
Well.. If you guys ever want a tour
of the neighbourhood...

616
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:56,991
Don't hesitate to call me.

617
00:52:57,046 --> 00:52:58,882
Blessed day!
- Bye.

618
00:53:00,529 --> 00:53:02,110
We should probably go too.

619
00:53:02,193 --> 00:53:03,451
Good morning.

620
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:27,423
<i>I don't remember what day it was</i>

621
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:33,725
<i>I didn't notice what time it was</i>

622
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:32,139
Help me!

623
00:58:33,436 --> 00:58:34,475
Help me!

624
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,641
Oh..ehe..
I'm sorry.

625
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,393
Thank you.

626
00:59:57,013 --> 00:59:58,666
Thank you for meeting with me.

627
00:59:58,958 --> 00:59:59,964
It's fine.

628
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:02,357
I was a little surprised
to hear from you though.

629
01:00:02,618 --> 01:00:03,759
Last time we spoke...

630
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:05,579
I said I didn't want to know any more.

631
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,482
Having Ehh..
Had a little distance I Ehm...

632
01:00:11,059 --> 01:00:13,715
Well, I.. I realize I could use
some.. some closure.

633
01:00:13,918 --> 01:00:16,739
I mean there.. there's just
to many unanswered questions.

634
01:00:16,986 --> 01:00:18,243
I understand.

635
01:00:19,274 --> 01:00:21,618
I brought what I have on the Higgins case.

636
01:00:27,134 --> 01:00:28,845
That's Annabelle there.

637
01:00:29,228 --> 01:00:30,712
The Higgins girl.

638
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,597
That was clearly taken before she

639
01:00:33,622 --> 01:00:35,162
got caught up in the cult.

640
01:00:36,764 --> 01:00:39,943
Looks a lot different than the last time
you saw her, doesn't she?

641
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,221
This cult that she was in.

642
01:00:46,697 --> 01:00:48,837
Did you look further into it?

643
01:00:49,143 --> 01:00:51,002
For what, specifically?

644
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:53,237
I don't know.
There must have been some motive

645
01:00:53,262 --> 01:00:54,808
for their attacks.

646
01:00:55,366 --> 01:00:57,429
Crazy people do crazy things.

647
01:00:57,454 --> 01:00:58,804
...crazy things.
I know.

648
01:00:59,881 --> 01:01:01,904
They didn't think they were crazy.

649
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,936
They have to have had a reason.

650
01:01:06,444 --> 01:01:08,082
After a little more digging...

651
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,879
I did find that their act
was in devotional.

652
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:12,496
That they were...

653
01:01:12,942 --> 01:01:16,212
They were actually trying
to conjure something up.

654
01:01:18,576 --> 01:01:19,820
Like.. Like what?

655
01:01:19,845 --> 01:01:21,873
The Devil.. Demons...

656
01:01:22,299 --> 01:01:24,830
The Tooth-fairy, I don't know specifically.

657
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:27,214
It doesn't really matter any..
- Why not?

658
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,037
Well, because this is all
just a bunch of hocus pocus.

659
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:32,303
Ahm...

660
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:35,123
Please.

661
01:01:44,843 --> 01:01:45,859
Ma'am.

662
01:01:47,406 --> 01:01:48,922
These were miscreants.

663
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:52,468
They were probably hopped up
on god knows what.

664
01:01:52,705 --> 01:01:54,003
And it made 'em...

665
01:01:54,028 --> 01:01:55,956
see and do
all sorts of...

666
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,791
terrible things.

667
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:10,508
Does this mean anything to you?

668
01:02:14,452 --> 01:02:16,335
Have you ever heard the expression...

669
01:02:16,724 --> 01:02:19,135
"sometimes a cigar is just a cigar"?

670
01:02:19,256 --> 01:02:21,881
Then you won't mind if I eh.. keep this...

671
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,540
one for myself?

672
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,449
Ehm...

673
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:27,940
One more thing.

674
01:02:27,965 --> 01:02:29,624
Does the cult have a name?

675
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,325
They called themselves:
"The Disciples of the Realm".

676
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,536
Hello again.

677
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,261
Is there anything I can help you with?

678
01:03:03,933 --> 01:03:06,011
Oh, no no no.
I.. I'm just...

679
01:03:06,036 --> 01:03:07,558
just browsing really.

680
01:03:08,447 --> 01:03:10,268
I just learned something.

681
01:03:11,095 --> 01:03:12,962
You're a terrible liar.

682
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,342
What is it you're looking for?

683
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:21,357
Maybe I'll come back.
- Mia!

684
01:03:21,856 --> 01:03:22,981
I'm old.

685
01:03:23,262 --> 01:03:26,317
Which means that there's very little
that surprises me anymore.

686
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:29,319
And if it does, I'm too tired to show it.

687
01:03:30,051 --> 01:03:32,122
Now. Are you gonna tell me?
Or are we just...

688
01:03:32,147 --> 01:03:35,205
I think my family
is being haunted by a.. a ghost.

689
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:39,389
Isle four. Follow me.

690
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,287
I.. I know it sounds crazy.

691
01:03:46,312 --> 01:03:49,108
The ghost of this girl haunting us.
But I.. I just...

692
01:03:49,133 --> 01:03:51,493
No crazier than the red sea parting.

693
01:03:51,891 --> 01:03:54,130
To non-believers it's all crazy.

694
01:03:54,535 --> 01:03:56,480
Do you believe in this stuff?

695
01:03:57,435 --> 01:03:59,331
Let's just say that...

696
01:03:59,356 --> 01:04:02,339
I've had one or two experiences
in my life that eh...

697
01:04:03,128 --> 01:04:05,456
helped me to keep an open mind.

698
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:17,685
I don't particularly think what you
are experiencing is the ghost of that girl.

699
01:04:18,584 --> 01:04:19,607
Why not?

700
01:04:19,632 --> 01:04:22,367
Well, ghosts haunts specific places.

701
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:25,594
Usually where something terrible
has happened.

702
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:27,407
Like your old house.

703
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,067
We.. We moved and it's still happening.

704
01:04:31,092 --> 01:04:33,098
Which is why I don't think it's a ghost.

705
01:04:33,807 --> 01:04:35,830
But now, that cult...

706
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:38,573
You said that they were trying
to summon something?

707
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,429
From what I've read in the past...

708
01:04:42,117 --> 01:04:44,648
These cults, they don't summon ghosts.

709
01:04:45,821 --> 01:04:48,657
They summon inhuman spirits.

710
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:51,266
Something that has never
existed in the flesh.

711
01:04:52,784 --> 01:04:54,128
Demons?

712
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:56,987
What.. What do they want?

713
01:04:58,212 --> 01:04:59,306
A soul.

714
01:05:00,586 --> 01:05:03,406
And they won't stop until they get one.

715
01:05:05,053 --> 01:05:06,772
What do I.. What do I do?

716
01:05:08,234 --> 01:05:11,070
Hopefully the answer
is in one of these books.

717
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,713
My daughter, Ruby.

718
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:34,060
She passed away
when she was about your age.

719
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:37,092
I'm sorry.

720
01:05:39,024 --> 01:05:42,860
Without her I felt like
I had nothing else to live for so...

721
01:05:44,404 --> 01:05:47,928
But as I lay there,
waiting for it all to end...

722
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:51,265
I heard her voice.

723
01:05:53,515 --> 01:05:55,792
She told me that it wasn't my time.

724
01:05:56,712 --> 01:05:59,173
That God had another purpose for me.

725
01:06:00,525 --> 01:06:02,619
You too have a purpose Mia.

726
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:05,725
To protect your family.

727
01:06:05,998 --> 01:06:08,694
So don't think you're crazy
for trying to do that.

728
01:06:08,718 --> 01:06:10,992
You do what you think is right.

729
01:06:12,183 --> 01:06:14,492
You do what you have to do.

730
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:07,713
The Devil prays on the weak

731
01:07:07,738 --> 01:07:09,662
and the vulnerable.

732
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:19,037
Seeking to devour their souls.

733
01:07:20,067 --> 01:07:21,567
To perform...

734
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:23,176
Incantations...

735
01:07:25,104 --> 01:07:27,643
Spilling the blood of kin.

736
01:07:29,277 --> 01:07:31,474
Spilling the blood of the innocent.

737
01:07:39,275 --> 01:07:41,431
How do I stop it?

738
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:51,224
Hey.

739
01:08:58,082 --> 01:08:59,168
Leah!

740
01:09:00,121 --> 01:09:01,191
Leah!

741
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,023
Leah!

742
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:16,197
What happened?

743
01:10:18,035 --> 01:10:20,652
Happened? You gotta help this travesty.

744
01:10:41,994 --> 01:10:43,195
Thank you for coming Father.

745
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,444
Yes. Of course.

746
01:10:51,857 --> 01:10:53,037
Mia.

747
01:10:53,935 --> 01:10:56,622
This Doll. May I see it?

748
01:11:33,892 --> 01:11:35,298
John got rid of her.

749
01:11:35,323 --> 01:11:36,493
Or tried to.

750
01:11:36,518 --> 01:11:39,259
There she was at the bottom
of one of our last boxes.

751
01:11:39,345 --> 01:11:42,827
I still don't understand what the doll
has to with this supposed demon.

752
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,740
Demons can sometimes
use objects as conduits

753
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:48,577
to achieve their desired goal.

754
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,959
Their desired goal?

755
01:11:51,797 --> 01:11:53,461
Our souls John.

756
01:11:54,172 --> 01:11:55,758
That's why it's after Leah.

757
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,106
It wants her soul.

758
01:11:59,131 --> 01:12:00,427
No no no.

759
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:03,414
Demons can't just take souls Mia.

760
01:12:03,814 --> 01:12:07,260
The soul needs to be offered to the demon
before it can take it.

761
01:12:07,346 --> 01:12:09,807
Well, I don't plan on offering
my soul anytime soon.

762
01:12:11,033 --> 01:12:12,908
The Devil is the father of lies.

763
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:15,666
Demons are his manipulators.

764
01:12:15,946 --> 01:12:18,329
No one ever plans to offer their soul.

765
01:12:18,354 --> 01:12:20,116
How can we get rid of it?

766
01:12:21,452 --> 01:12:23,577
How do we stop it from coming back?

767
01:12:24,001 --> 01:12:25,634
I don't know.

768
01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:26,994
Not yet.

769
01:12:27,019 --> 01:12:29,225
But someone at the church might.

770
01:12:29,975 --> 01:12:31,963
At the very least I've
heard of a married couple

771
01:12:31,988 --> 01:12:33,861
that the church has
worked with in the past

772
01:12:33,886 --> 01:12:35,619
that deal with this kind of thing.

773
01:12:36,475 --> 01:12:39,006
They're back east but a call
can always be placed.

774
01:12:39,031 --> 01:12:40,608
What do we do in the meantime?

775
01:12:41,839 --> 01:12:44,526
I can't have Leah anywhere near that doll.

776
01:12:47,065 --> 01:12:48,745
Let me take her.

777
01:12:49,618 --> 01:12:53,298
Perhaps if she's stored in a sacred place
it will weaken the demon enough.

778
01:12:53,323 --> 01:12:55,596
It won't have the strength to return.

779
01:12:58,315 --> 01:12:59,838
Thank you Father.

780
01:13:00,436 --> 01:13:01,952
Of course.

781
01:13:58,515 --> 01:13:59,693
Come on.

782
01:13:59,718 --> 01:14:01,257
Let's get you to bed.
Doctors orders.

783
01:14:01,282 --> 01:14:03,005
Oh, no no John.
I can't.

784
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:04,411
Not until I know it's not coming back.

785
01:14:04,436 --> 01:14:07,275
Mia. Come on.
What if.. what if...

786
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,986
John. I can't.
- What if I just stayed up with her?

787
01:14:10,011 --> 01:14:11,479
You get some rest.

788
01:14:13,012 --> 01:14:14,036
Alright?

789
01:14:14,061 --> 01:14:15,239
Okay.

790
01:14:15,934 --> 01:14:17,012
Good night.

791
01:14:17,468 --> 01:14:18,538
John.

792
01:14:21,434 --> 01:14:22,489
Yeah.

793
01:14:23,066 --> 01:14:25,449
Thank you for believing me.

794
01:14:25,725 --> 01:14:28,241
I didn't know if.. if you would.

795
01:14:28,639 --> 01:14:29,819
Mia!

796
01:14:30,343 --> 01:14:31,202
Come on.

797
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:32,765
I love you.

798
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:35,023
I will always believe you.

799
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:40,406
Good night.

800
01:14:41,374 --> 01:14:44,054
Do you think Father Perez is gonna help us?

801
01:14:44,885 --> 01:14:46,448
Yeah. I do.

802
01:15:14,498 --> 01:15:15,545
Come on.

803
01:15:16,314 --> 01:15:19,806
May God have mercy on your soul!!

804
01:17:14,277 --> 01:17:15,981
Frankly Mia...

805
01:17:16,612 --> 01:17:18,198
It's none of your business.

806
01:17:19,456 --> 01:17:21,265
This is between me and Leah.

807
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:24,093
And she said she wanted those pajamas.

808
01:17:25,452 --> 01:17:27,429
You're gonna spoil her.

809
01:17:28,753 --> 01:17:31,042
I didn't have a chance for grandkids.

810
01:17:31,067 --> 01:17:33,253
Besides it's impossible to spoil a baby.

811
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:35,349
Oh oh. I don't know if that's the truth.

812
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:38,670
We just have to take that up
with Leah because

813
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:40,779
she also pointed out these dresses.

814
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,264
Oh Evelyn.

815
01:18:08,747 --> 01:18:10,388
Oh sweetie-pie.

816
01:18:10,413 --> 01:18:13,481
Oh, it get's crazier.
Oh mommy.

817
01:18:13,506 --> 01:18:14,735
Okay. You know what?

818
01:18:14,766 --> 01:18:18,173
My Ruby used to fuzz and fuzz
until I rocked her.

819
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,415
Put her down here.

820
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,252
She used to fuzz and fuzz.
Come on.

821
01:18:23,962 --> 01:18:25,203
Come here Leah.

822
01:18:25,228 --> 01:18:27,501
All right Leah. Okay. Here we go.

823
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:29,485
Here we go Leah.

824
01:18:32,147 --> 01:18:35,534
<i>We gonna rock that baby
all night long</i>

825
01:18:40,536 --> 01:18:42,213
You are a lifesaver.

826
01:18:43,856 --> 01:18:45,591
What was it that you were humming?

827
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:48,076
Oh.. A little blues ditty.

828
01:18:48,389 --> 01:18:52,365
It was the only thing that would
settle my Ruby down when she was a baby

829
01:18:56,205 --> 01:18:58,314
Do you mind if I ask how she passed?

830
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:01,456
I don't mind if..
If you don't wanna talk about it...

831
01:19:01,481 --> 01:19:03,164
Oh no. It's okay.

832
01:19:03,898 --> 01:19:05,820
It was a car accident.

833
01:19:07,935 --> 01:19:10,682
We were driving back from my parents.

834
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,537
They live up north.

835
01:19:12,694 --> 01:19:13,696
So eh..

836
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:15,919
I was tired.
You know?

837
01:19:16,765 --> 01:19:18,960
Family'll do that to you.

838
01:19:20,554 --> 01:19:23,770
It was.. very late and I shouldn't
have been behind the wheel.

839
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,734
Last thing I remember was...

840
01:19:30,351 --> 01:19:32,905
Looking over in the passengers seat.

841
01:19:33,772 --> 01:19:36,679
At my daughter.
Asleep.

842
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:43,071
Yeah. She had grown into
the most beautiful young woman.

843
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:50,593
I woke up three weeks later.

844
01:19:50,968 --> 01:19:52,960
And Ruby never did.

845
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,361
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

846
01:19:59,477 --> 01:20:02,162
I didn't get to beg god to take me first.

847
01:20:05,505 --> 01:20:07,268
I made the mistake and...

848
01:20:10,154 --> 01:20:11,810
She paid the price.

849
01:20:46,015 --> 01:20:47,085
Father.

850
01:20:48,922 --> 01:20:50,620
Where is it?

851
01:20:50,883 --> 01:20:52,157
Where's what?

852
01:20:52,182 --> 01:20:53,430
The doll...

853
01:20:54,495 --> 01:20:55,956
You took it with you.

854
01:21:00,431 --> 01:21:01,884
The Evil...

855
01:21:03,131 --> 01:21:04,897
It's presence.

856
01:21:04,922 --> 01:21:07,037
I saw it John.

857
01:21:07,862 --> 01:21:09,335
I felt it.

858
01:21:10,478 --> 01:21:12,834
I felt how much it wants...

859
01:21:13,505 --> 01:21:14,826
Want's what?

860
01:21:15,061 --> 01:21:17,311
To take her soul.

861
01:21:17,863 --> 01:21:18,926
But you said...

862
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:21,689
That it can't take Leah's.
You.. You said that it has to be offered.

863
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:26,345
A baby cannot offer it's soul.

864
01:21:28,938 --> 01:21:30,290
Oh my god.

865
01:21:30,502 --> 01:21:31,759
Mia!

866
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:43,611
Here. I'll get that.

867
01:21:46,685 --> 01:21:48,005
Hello?
- Mia.

868
01:21:48,662 --> 01:21:50,219
Father Perez was in an accident.

869
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:51,336
He said...

870
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:57,183
John?!
- Mia. Mia!

871
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:58,550
I need you to get out of the house.

872
01:21:58,575 --> 01:21:59,637
Okay? I Ne...

873
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,438
...I'm leaving now.

874
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:27,806
Father Perez?

875
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:36,278
Is everything all right?

876
01:22:40,824 --> 01:22:41,832
Father.

877
01:22:45,262 --> 01:22:49,084
<i>MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL!</i>

878
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,107
Who is that?

879
01:23:08,186 --> 01:23:09,592
We need to leave.

880
01:23:11,335 --> 01:23:12,483
Leah!

881
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,449
Leah. Leah!

882
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:37,274
Mia. The phone is dead.
Come on.

883
01:23:37,299 --> 01:23:38,860
Wait wait wait!
- We'll have to go to my apartment.

884
01:23:38,885 --> 01:23:40,383
You need to come with me,

885
01:23:40,408 --> 01:23:41,587
No. I need to find Leah.

886
01:23:41,626 --> 01:23:44,228
We'll get her back. We need
to get the church. They'll help us.

887
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:45,220
Come!

888
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:25,544
Leah!

889
01:24:28,841 --> 01:24:29,771
Leah!

890
01:24:37,088 --> 01:24:38,181
Leah!

891
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:56,024
What do you want from me?

892
01:24:56,462 --> 01:24:58,196
<b>What do you want from me?!</b>

893
01:25:56,513 --> 01:25:58,052
Give her back to me.

894
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:02,052
You give her back.

895
01:26:20,603 --> 01:26:21,712
Leah!

896
01:26:23,236 --> 01:26:24,299
Leah!

897
01:26:25,462 --> 01:26:26,431
Leah!

898
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:29,442
Leah!

899
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,576
LEAH!

900
01:26:36,336 --> 01:26:38,211
Leah my baby!

901
01:26:40,547 --> 01:26:42,133
Oh please God no!

902
01:27:03,862 --> 01:27:06,800
Oh Please!
Where is she?!

903
01:27:07,757 --> 01:27:09,515
There has to be another way.

904
01:27:24,118 --> 01:27:26,782
<i>Your soul...</i>

905
01:27:28,985 --> 01:27:30,735
<i>Your soul...</i>

906
01:27:32,731 --> 01:27:34,497
<i>Your soul...</i>

907
01:27:35,778 --> 01:27:37,575
<i>Your soul...</i>

908
01:28:09,202 --> 01:28:12,069
Mommy's gonna save you Leah.
Mommy's gonna...

909
01:28:15,751 --> 01:28:17,001
Mia!

910
01:28:23,203 --> 01:28:24,305
Mia!

911
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,068
Mia!

912
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:37,708
Mia!

913
01:28:43,019 --> 01:28:44,963
Mommy's coming...

914
01:28:59,721 --> 01:29:01,104
Mia!
Hey Hey!

915
01:29:01,129 --> 01:29:02,558
She's in there.
I can't get in.

916
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:03,730
Mia! MIA!

917
01:29:13,197 --> 01:29:14,549
Mia. No no no no no.

918
01:29:15,548 --> 01:29:16,501
Stop.

919
01:29:17,193 --> 01:29:18,099
Stop.

920
01:29:18,802 --> 01:29:20,911
Okay okay okay.
Hear. Listen to me.

921
01:29:20,936 --> 01:29:22,349
Please. Come down.

922
01:29:23,688 --> 01:29:25,142
It took my baby.

923
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:26,775
Please. You gotta come down.

924
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,431
Please come down. Okay?

925
01:29:28,456 --> 01:29:31,387
It wants her soul.
I.. have to give it mine John.

926
01:29:31,412 --> 01:29:32,543
Mia! No!

927
01:29:32,568 --> 01:29:34,043
Don't do it.

928
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:36,447
It won't give her back unless I...
No! No!

929
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:37,936
Mia! Listen to me.

930
01:29:37,961 --> 01:29:40,765
Leah needs you here. Okay sweetie?
I need you here.

931
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:42,189
Please don't do this.

932
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,502
I love you John.

933
01:29:46,829 --> 01:29:48,009
I love you.

934
01:29:48,165 --> 01:29:50,310
I know you'll take good care of our Leah.

935
01:29:51,936 --> 01:29:53,670
You kiss her every night.

936
01:29:54,325 --> 01:29:57,528
When she's old enough John,
you tell her that I loved her.

937
01:29:58,628 --> 01:29:59,448
No!

938
01:30:02,488 --> 01:30:03,501
John! No!

939
01:30:03,526 --> 01:30:04,339
Stop. Stop.

940
01:30:04,364 --> 01:30:06,472
John. It wants her soul.
- Mia. Stop. Stop.

941
01:30:06,497 --> 01:30:08,152
My baby!

942
01:30:10,536 --> 01:30:11,989
Mia. Listen to him.

943
01:30:12,014 --> 01:30:13,790
You can't do this to Leah.

944
01:30:14,382 --> 01:30:16,407
A daughter needs her mother.

945
01:30:16,432 --> 01:30:17,462
You said it needs a soul.

946
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:18,641
You said it needs a soul!

947
01:30:19,006 --> 01:30:21,514
Please.
- Please let me save her.

948
01:30:22,389 --> 01:30:23,904
You don't wanna do this. Anything else.

949
01:30:23,929 --> 01:30:25,218
Stop stop stop.
- No!

950
01:30:25,243 --> 01:30:28,265
You said you'd save her.
You said you'd save her before me.

951
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:29,561
You promised.

952
01:30:29,586 --> 01:30:31,615
Think about our baby.
Think about Leah.

953
01:30:31,807 --> 01:30:34,159
Okay?
Think about her. Please.

954
01:30:34,192 --> 01:30:36,265
Don't do this to us.
- It wants her soul.

955
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:38,003
There has to be another way.

956
01:30:38,362 --> 01:30:39,604
There is.

957
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:41,432
I can make it right.

958
01:30:43,152 --> 01:30:44,715
This is what Ruby meant.

959
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:47,496
Oh. No no.

960
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:15,823
God honors sacrifice.

961
01:31:17,107 --> 01:31:19,833
And our sacrifices touch Gods heart.

962
01:31:20,139 --> 01:31:21,736
And move his hand.

963
01:31:23,585 --> 01:31:26,288
Jesus said:
This is my commandment.

964
01:31:27,007 --> 01:31:29,624
That you love one another
as I have loved you.

965
01:31:30,915 --> 01:31:33,321
Greater love hath no-one but this:

966
01:31:33,563 --> 01:31:36,587
That he lay down his life for his friends.

967
01:31:40,163 --> 01:31:41,866
Let us pray.

968
01:32:00,814 --> 01:32:02,417
Wonderful sermon.

969
01:32:02,442 --> 01:32:04,739
You look well father.
- Thank you Mia.

970
01:32:05,216 --> 01:32:06,629
And how are you doing?

971
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,964
We're doing much better now.
Thank you.

972
01:32:09,363 --> 01:32:11,111
Has there been any sign of the doll?

973
01:32:11,307 --> 01:32:13,329
No. Not since that night.

974
01:32:13,814 --> 01:32:15,118
I thought the police took it.

975
01:32:15,143 --> 01:32:17,275
But Detective Clarkin has no record of it.

976
01:32:18,322 --> 01:32:19,968
But evil is constant.

977
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:22,913
You cannot destroy what was never created.

978
01:32:22,976 --> 01:32:26,421
I just pray that whomever comes into
contact with the doll next

979
01:32:26,446 --> 01:32:28,015
gets the help they need.

980
01:32:30,027 --> 01:32:31,433
So do we.

981
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:34,449
Good to see you.

982
01:32:35,329 --> 01:32:37,056
Bye Father.
- Bye Mia.

983
01:32:37,915 --> 01:32:39,909
Oh! I almost forgot.

984
01:32:41,017 --> 01:32:42,478
Oh. It's beautiful.

985
01:32:43,192 --> 01:32:44,664
Thank you father.

986
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:47,388
The loveliest masterpiece
at the heart of God...

987
01:32:48,415 --> 01:32:50,451
Is the love of a mother.

988
01:32:53,646 --> 01:32:54,880
Thank you.

989
01:33:24,476 --> 01:33:26,101
Anything I can help you with?

990
01:33:26,216 --> 01:33:29,464
Oh. I'm just trying to find
something for my daughter.

991
01:33:29,489 --> 01:33:30,700
Thanks.

992
01:33:30,978 --> 01:33:32,611
She's a nurse.

993
01:33:32,636 --> 01:33:34,370
Always helping people.

994
01:33:35,816 --> 01:33:38,568
We looked everywhere for one of these.

995
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:40,823
Never did find one.

996
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:43,655
It's a collectors item supposedly.

997
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,000
That's why we.. prize it
a little higher than the rest.

998
01:33:47,836 --> 01:33:50,547
You want me to ring it up?
- Yes please.
