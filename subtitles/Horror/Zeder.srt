1
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:55,146
Mrs. Hubert!

2
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:10,393
ls anyone home?

3
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:43,306
This is the third one
We found mangled like this.

4
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:46,431
The guys below Want
the autopsy results before noon.

5
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:25,864
l Want all traffic blocked down
at the intersection of the highway.

6
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:27,433
Nobody gets through.

7
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:36,946
Dr. Meyer, the area has been
completely blocked off,

8
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:38,867
all over three hours now.

9
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,986
- What are you planning to do?
- Wait a minute.

10
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:45,512
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you, Mrs. Hubert.

11
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:50,467
lnspector Bouffet and l
Would be extremely grateful

12
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:52,464
if you'd retire to the kitchen.

13
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:57,388
- There must be absolute silence in
the house. - lf only you can do it!

14
00:03:57,873 --> 00:03:59,909
lf only you can do it.

15
00:04:58,392 --> 00:05:00,269
lt's time, Gabriella.

16
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:04,987
- Come on. - No!
- lt's all up to us now.

17
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,343
l don't Want to!

18
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:11,505
lf you think it's Wise
We could hold off on this thing.

19
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:18,066
l'm Warning you, don't follow us.

20
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,741
- At least take this.
- No.

21
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:23,228
Give me a portable lamp instead.

22
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:28,304
Please, no!

23
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,907
Now tell me Where you're hiding.

24
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:36,630
That's all l Want to know.

25
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,782
After that it'll all be over.

26
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:47,710
l'm scared.

27
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:26,744
Show me Where your hiding-place is.

28
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,463
Show me Where it is.

29
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:33,662
Where are you?

30
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:37,146
You're here, aren't you?

31
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,149
ls this Where you are?

32
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,986
ls this Where you're hiding?
lt's under here?

33
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,503
We found him!

34
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,468
lt's down here!

35
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,667
We found him!

36
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,027
Come on, down here!

37
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,388
Come on, We found him!

38
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,384
Easy...

39
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,186
Slow down.

40
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,068
She's better, the hospital says
she'll pull through.

41
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,699
lnspector, take a look.

42
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:23,738
Out.

43
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:27,821
Come, Dr. Meyer.
lt's your right.

44
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:59,263
l think We better pull him
out of there.

45
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:20,546
- What's that?
- A slipper.

46
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:22,787
Gabriella's slipper.

47
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:32,626
What else did you find?

48
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,740
Not much.

49
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:38,337
Here.

50
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,579
Thank you very much.

51
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:47,540
They just operated.

52
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:50,946
lt doesn't look like
they're going to save her leg.

53
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:56,578
Here, Meyer. This is everything
We'll ever know about him.

54
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:01,979
Not much to go on, is it?

55
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,901
To find out Who he Was.

56
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:21,026
lssued to Paolo Zeder.

57
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,697
We found Paolo Zeder!

58
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,902
A K zone!

59
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:35,147
He stumbled across a K zone.

60
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:59,502
- Wait a minute.
- Open up, it's me.

61
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:03,536
l know. l'll let you in
on one condition.

62
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,495
That you stay out of the kitchen.
Okay?

63
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:09,020
Okay.

64
00:11:14,627 --> 00:11:17,221
- What a surprise.
- Happy anniversary.

65
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:19,383
Happy anniversary to you.

66
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,659
What is it?

67
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:31,304
lt's the one!

68
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:44,665
lt's gorgeous!

69
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:47,020
lt's electric.

70
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:50,336
They said it's a terrific model.

71
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:56,262
Only the electric cord Was missing.
So l called the electrician,

72
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:58,423
and he put one on.

73
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,136
lt types like printing in a book.

74
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:06,216
Just What a Writer needs, right?

75
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:09,664
lt's fantastic!

76
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:11,783
You're beautiful.

77
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:14,784
- You ought to see Where We got it.
- Where?

78
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:19,383
Mama Went to a pawnshop auction.

79
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,778
lt Was an anniversary
like in the movies, Wasn't it?

80
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,826
l'm going to go enjoy
my present a little.

81
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:56,584
- Who knows Who it belonged to?
- Who ?

82
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,542
Did you know Hemingway
typed standing up?

83
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:06,335
Novel number three.

84
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:13,734
The story begins...

85
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:30,183
The barriers of death

86
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:34,422
shall at last
be destroyed...

87
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:40,693
The temperature and depth
of K zone l found...

88
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:46,214
Correct and totally free,
above all suspicion...

89
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:52,338
Where buried body shall await...

90
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:31,572
- What are you doing still up?
- Wait a second, please.

91
00:15:36,223 --> 00:15:39,101
l think l found the plot
for my third novel.

92
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,938
Curiosity about What happens
after death

93
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:44,133
grew to an obsessive quest.

94
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:48,933
But We'll go back to the oracles
of the dead on Tuesday.

95
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:51,941
Tell your classmates
to start showing up.

96
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,141
Have a nice Week-end.

97
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:55,816
Professor Chesi.

98
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,057
- Do you remember me?
- Certainly l do!

99
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:02,540
Your Wife keeps me informed
about the novels you're Writing,

100
00:16:02,623 --> 00:16:05,057
and the fact
you haven't graduated yet.

101
00:16:05,143 --> 00:16:07,532
l Wrote two and
neither has a publisher.

102
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:10,342
But now l've got an idea, l mean.

103
00:16:11,423 --> 00:16:14,062
But l need some advice,
an expert opinion.

104
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:18,059
Witchcraft, magic, resurrections,

105
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,373
devilry, ghosts and haunted houses?

106
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:23,933
Maybe something along that line.
Do you have a minute?

107
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:25,821
Let's go to my office.

108
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:34,501
You can come back in half an hour,
Laura?

109
00:16:36,022 --> 00:16:37,819
All right, Professor.

110
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:46,451
Nineteen, an orphan, she swears
she only goes for mature men.

111
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:48,737
Take a look.

112
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:51,293
- What are these?
- Two letters.

113
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:55,290
One is a letter, the other is a kind
of report, but l don't understand.

114
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,852
Later l'll explain how l got hold
of them, but read them first.

115
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:14,658
The first requires no comment.

116
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,576
lt's the second part
of a letter asking for...

117
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:22,693
Where the Writer congratulates
this Goodman character

118
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:25,421
for having gotten financing
and hopes part of the money

119
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,096
Will go to him
so he can finish his Work.

120
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:32,256
Money he probably never got
if he had to pawn his typewriter.

121
00:17:32,662 --> 00:17:33,651
What ?

122
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:36,581
- What about the second?
- The second?

123
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:41,779
lf it's true, if it isn't
the fruit of your imagination,

124
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,853
it's singular.
- Singular? lt's insane!

125
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,535
Besides all these numbers,
temperature, depth...

126
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:52,500
Here it talks about the guy donating
his own body to the experiment.

127
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,572
Did you read this?

128
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:57,300
''The barriers of death
shall at last be destroyed,

129
00:17:57,381 --> 00:18:00,771
thanks to our Work. My return
to life Will signal return of all.''

130
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:04,930
And this:
''The place l have discovered,

131
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:08,174
is the place the hierophant
Was looking for.''

132
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:11,094
- What does hierophant mean?
- A master of mysteries.

133
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:13,974
Now you have to tell me
Where you found it,

134
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,780
because there's something else
that only a scholar,

135
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:19,694
an expert in the history
of religions can see.

136
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,690
That's Why l have to know exactly
Who you got it from,

137
00:18:23,781 --> 00:18:25,578
and if the text is correct.

138
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:30,213
Here's  l got it.
A present from Alessandra.

139
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:31,654
An old typewriter.

140
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:36,810
Out of curiosity, l Wrote out
everything typed on the old ribbon.

141
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:40,331
- Here it is.
- Check Where it says ''K zone''.

142
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:50,771
''Found a K zone completely free
and unsuspected, ideal place...''

143
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,859
lt's an old theory going back
to the turn of the century.

144
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,250
A former student of mine,
a Swiss scholar named Meyer,

145
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,331
Wrote a thesis on it.

146
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,334
Funny, l thought it Was here.

147
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,812
These K zones Were the result
of research done by Paolo Zeder.

148
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,860
Somebody Who just
disappeared into thin air.

149
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,059
This Zeder sustained that in all the
places in antiquity Where contact

150
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,654
had been made With the Beyond,
With the dead,

151
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,176
from Delphi to Epirus
to Dodona and so on,

152
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,536
constants could be determined,
Which he called alchemical,

153
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,852
but Which We Would today call
chemical or geological similarities.

154
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,453
The areas he called K zones
Were supposed to be different.

155
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,890
They defied all natural laws

156
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,210
and existed in state of suspension.

157
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,613
ln a non-time, a non-season,
a non-growth, a non-death.

158
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,009
ldealistically, a zero-time.

159
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,014
And it Would allow
a return from the dead.

160
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,250
On my Way!

161
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,779
Don't scream at me
about yesterday's training.

162
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:12,851
The Commissioner himself
Wouldn't give me permission.

163
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:15,089
Never mind,
nobody showed up, as usual.

164
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,776
How can you find out Who something
belonged to in a pawnshop?

165
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,974
Hi. Did l scare you?

166
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:42,529
- l Was Waiting for you.
- What do you Want?

167
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:47,450
- l saw how you Were looking at me
today. - You're crazy!

168
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:54,336
- Go on home.
- Pig! Son of a bitch!

169
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:56,207
Forget it.

170
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,414
You ass hole!

171
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,292
Shithead!
How dare you treat me like that!

172
00:21:14,298 --> 00:21:16,766
The decision taken there
Was a mistake...

173
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,294
l'm sure.
See you later, sorry.

174
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:24,535
- How are you today, Miss Goodman?
- Fine.

175
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:34,014
- Do you plan to stay late tonight?
- l don't know.

176
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:58,097
- Hi.
- Come in.

177
00:21:58,178 --> 00:22:01,932
- Guido! - This is for you.
- You're crazy. Thanks.

178
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:04,088
Forget it.

179
00:22:04,178 --> 00:22:07,693
That's What's so great about
friends, they hate each other.

180
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:09,974
- Right?
- Right.

181
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:12,933
- And this is for you.
- Thank you.

182
00:22:13,018 --> 00:22:15,452
- What is it?
- Nothing, an address.

183
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:18,097
- Aren't you staying for dinner?
- Next time.

184
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:21,608
- l have to do six
shoot-outs before bed-time. - Wait.

185
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:25,653
l found it in the flea market.

186
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,970
l Wanted to give it to you
When you got promoted,

187
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:33,050
but today l have to be forgiven.
- Let me see.

188
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:10,969
ls anyone here?

189
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:21,409
Sorry,
l Was looking for Don Luigi Costa.

190
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:26,053
- Who are you? - l have
something to show Don Luigi.

191
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:30,295
- What's it about? - Something
personal, l can only  it to him.

192
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:33,573
- Did Don Emidio send you here?
- No, Who's that?

193
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:37,895
You Were saying you had something
personal for Don Luigi Costa?

194
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:41,013
Yes, it's kind of nonsensical...

195
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:44,812
Somebody gave me a typewriter
that used to belong to him.

196
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:49,650
Go on. What's this all about?

197
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:52,933
You're Don Luigi!
Well, here.

198
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:55,528
Look.

199
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:18,696
- You must be mad.
- Why?

200
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:22,287
You attribute these things
to a priest?

201
00:24:22,536 --> 00:24:24,891
No, they seem strange to me too.

202
00:24:24,976 --> 00:24:27,570
Before going to the police,
l Wanted to find out...

203
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:31,535
Nobody in the World
could have Written such nonsense.

204
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:34,688
l never owned a typewriter
in my life!

205
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:39,690
- Only the table? - l don't think you
have the authority to interrogate

206
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:43,529
the first one you come across.
- You don't plan to help me?

207
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,527
Sure l'll help you.
Tear up this stuff.

208
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,890
And forget it
as quickly as possible.

209
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:52,087
Don't ever come back,
understand?

210
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:27,007
Well? You're the one
Who's in training, not me!

211
00:25:32,295 --> 00:25:34,855
- God, now What?
- Funny.

212
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,730
Nobody's supposed to be here.

213
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:42,130
- Where are you going?
- Quiet. Be quiet...

214
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,366
ls anyone up there?

215
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:17,132
ls that you?

216
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:27,086
Are you down here?

217
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,931
What kind of trick is this?

218
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:47,044
Where the heck Were you?

219
00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:48,965
The circuit breakers blew down below.

220
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:52,723
- Something Wrong?
- Nothing, Why?

221
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:04,566
- Damn, they Were right here.
- What?

222
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:09,971
What do you mean, What?

223
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:14,043
Come on. The letters, the ribbon,
Hand them over.

224
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,931
l swear l don't know
a thing about it.

225
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:23,284
Excuse me, l Was here
this morning to see Don Luigi.

226
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:25,284
l left some papers
in his office.

227
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:28,650
- Who did you say?
- Don Luigi, l talked With him.

228
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:31,212
Come in.

229
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:36,212
Wait here.

230
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:14,006
l Was looking for Don Luigi Costa.

231
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:18,131
He hasn't been part of Mother Church
for over 10 years now.

232
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:21,090
- He left his vows.
- Today, in the parish office,

233
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:25,723
this bald man, Who said he Was...
- But that's just not possible.

234
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:28,280
Besides Don Emidio,
l'm always around.

235
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:31,921
Seeing the devotion of our
parishioners, two of us are too many.

236
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:36,643
Listen, l'm not crazy.
l'm positive that l met him, l mean.

237
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:40,129
That's impossible,
l didn't go out the Whole day.

238
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:44,203
- When you're away, Father...
- Yes, of course.

239
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:48,124
- l'm sure you're mistaken.
- No, it can't be.

240
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:53,409
He Was in a kind of closet,
rummaging through a pile of papers.

241
00:28:59,252 --> 00:29:01,482
l don't know Who you met today,

242
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:03,722
but it certainly
Wasn't Don Luigi Costa.

243
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:07,842
l don't Want to know anything
about What Was in those letters.

244
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:12,207
l only know that Luigi used to be
a highly esteemed priest here.

245
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:14,888
He Was in charge of the children.

246
00:29:14,972 --> 00:29:17,769
lt Was he Who took them
to camp every summer.

247
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,123
Then his Weird studies
Went to his head.

248
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:25,204
- l say it Was his illness.
- What illness?

249
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:28,768
Unfortunately he discovered
he had an incurable disease.

250
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:32,848
lt coincided With his decision
to abandon his vows.

251
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,849
Anyway,

252
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:41,649
from that time on
he started talking funny.

253
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:47,361
Don Emidio used to bless
the sacristy When he Went out.

254
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:51,408
Then he disappeared,
We haven't heard from him since.

255
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:56,481
l believe he Wound up
With a sister of his,

256
00:29:57,091 --> 00:29:59,889
Who had a house in Rimini.

257
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:04,368
Or maybe he's there in the hospital.

258
00:30:04,451 --> 00:30:07,841
lt's been so long
since he's come around here.

259
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,284
Do you Want the address?

260
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,287
l'll tell him you're here.

261
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,519
Gabriella,
l'm very Worried about you.

262
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,202
Now that the most delicate phase
is about to begin...

263
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,078
You mustn't. l have one more reason
than you and the others.

264
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,760
A reason it's hard to forget.

265
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,839
At any price,
l have to understand.

266
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:41,880
You may come in.

267
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:48,402
Right this Way.

268
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:12,879
We found a further confirmation
of What We're looking for,

269
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:16,999
thanks to the Work
of the ltalian research team.

270
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:28,918
Last night l Was thinking...

271
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:32,883
You've devoted over 30 years
of your life to this business,

272
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:36,484
maybe Without thinking
about one fact.

273
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:41,965
Every 70 years more than 3 hundred
million people on the earth die.

274
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:46,521
Meyer, three hundred million!
Life is based on this certainty.

275
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:50,238
Death is indispensable,
and fortunately up to now

276
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:52,603
We've had no counter indications.

277
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:57,639
Death isn't an illness that can
be cured, it's a definite finality.

278
00:32:57,728 --> 00:33:01,164
And that it must remain.

279
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,879
Paolo Zeder offered himself
for the sake of his research,

280
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:08,957
having himself secretly buried
in that ground, under that house,

281
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:11,723
to demonstrate his theories
Were Well-founded.

282
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:15,887
There may be a Way to come back
and We're about to discover it.

283
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:19,526
You yourself have been With us
since the beginning.

284
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:23,044
You've encouraged us, helped us,

285
00:33:23,488 --> 00:33:26,605
and you're asking us
to leave off now?

286
00:33:30,688 --> 00:33:34,158
- The risks?
- They Will occur far away from here.

287
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:37,998
From tonight on,
the risks Will be ours alone.

288
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:55,237
- Hello?
- Stefano. - Who is this?

289
00:33:55,328 --> 00:34:02,119
That letter you found Was meant
for somebody Who never got it.

290
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,675
- Who is this?
- Don't interrupt, shithead.

291
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:08,043
lf you Want to know more
you can make a bundle.

292
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:11,278
Just be at the Margherita Gardens
around ten.

293
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:16,805
Bring enough cash to make it Worth
my While, you'll find out plenty.

294
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:19,560
Come alone.

295
00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:21,205
Hello?

296
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:49,522
Stefano, are you inside?

297
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:57,007
Where the fuck are you, asshole?

298
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:04,682
What a jerk you are. What
Were you trying to do, scare me?

299
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:14,165
Who are you?
What do you Want?

300
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,479
l'm trying
to bring it all into focus.

301
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,363
A bunch of Words on a ribbon.

302
00:35:53,446 --> 00:35:56,563
Where do they lead? To an ex-priest.

303
00:35:57,086 --> 00:35:59,998
And a phone call
saying they know everything.

304
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:03,078
And a meeting out there,
in the middle of the night.

305
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:06,476
And the appointment never kept.

306
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:09,638
Okay, Stefano, cut it out.
You've got to stop.

307
00:36:10,406 --> 00:36:13,762
- This isn't stuff for us.
- l'm going to Rimini tomorrow,

308
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:17,077
to look for this Luigi Costa
character. You do What you Want.

309
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:19,281
At least let me take a bathing suit.

310
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:32,476
This must be it.

311
00:36:35,885 --> 00:36:37,841
So What are We doing?

312
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:42,317
Didn't you Want to get some sun
and study? There's a beach.

313
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:52,713
Join you later!

314
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:27,602
Anybody home?

315
00:37:35,444 --> 00:37:37,241
ls anybody home?

316
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:40,283
Excuse me...

317
00:37:42,644 --> 00:37:44,635
Can l come in?

318
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:51,081
- Anybody home? Hello!
- Who's there?

319
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:54,121
Excuse me, ma'am...

320
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:07,835
- Who told you you could come in?
- Nobody, l saw the For Rent sign...

321
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:11,554
You must've seen the notice
to go to the agency.

322
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:14,558
- l did read it...
- Anyway, l've decided

323
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:18,683
not to rent it after all. They have
to take that damn thing down.

324
00:38:21,324 --> 00:38:26,159
l took the liberty because l know Don
Luigi from When l Was a kid, at camp.

325
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:29,122
That's how
l knew this Was his house.

326
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:33,601
l thought he'd have rented to me,
more readily than to others.

327
00:38:33,684 --> 00:38:36,676
My brother's not here.
He's not With us anymore.

328
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:43,441
- When did it happen?
- A month ago.

329
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:46,560
But he Was in and out
of that hospital almost a year.

330
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:50,602
With those butchers Who are
only capable of killing people...

331
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:55,762
- l'm terribly sorry.
- Thank you.

332
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:03,719
- l'll be going now.
- Were you very close to him?

333
00:39:19,563 --> 00:39:22,202
Look inside that vase
on the chest over there.

334
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:25,557
There's the key
to the room upstairs.

335
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,632
Take it and go have a look.

336
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:39,394
- Did you find it?
- Yes, here it is.

337
00:39:42,203 --> 00:39:44,000
Watch out for the lock.

338
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:47,836
lt's old and the key
might break off inside.

339
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:52,674
Nobody's been up there
since last summer.

340
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,398
lt Was his room.

341
00:40:55,482 --> 00:40:57,154
Done?

342
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,191
Are you sure nobody's
been up here for a year?

343
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:04,193
Certainly. But in any case,
it's not for rent.

344
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:08,037
lf you Would show me
the courtesy of leaving...

345
00:41:09,161 --> 00:41:12,836
- Bologna Police headquarters.
- This is a friend of Guido's...

346
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:16,755
- Lieutenant Guido Silvestri.
May l speak to him? - Hold the line.

347
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:24,750
Sorry, he isn't here anymore.
He's been transferred.

348
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:27,874
He's been transferred?
Where, exactly?

349
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:31,078
l'm not authorized to give out
that kind of information.

350
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:33,679
A girlfriend?

351
00:41:34,921 --> 00:41:38,038
Did you know
Guido's been transferred?

352
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:41,361
Transferred... Where?

353
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:43,714
They didn't Want to say.

354
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:49,157
He Was a kind of nasty.

355
00:41:54,841 --> 00:41:56,479
lt's funny...

356
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:02,957
A guy like Guido leaving and
not even coming to say goodbye.

357
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:06,998
So, he's dead and she's blind.

358
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,593
That's it.

359
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,795
We better go back to Bologna.

360
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,913
The house of mystery...
Look at Swanson and Von Stroheim!

361
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,793
lt's him!

362
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,950
The one Who said
he Was the priest.

363
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,999
l'm sure of it.

364
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:20,107
He knows me. You better go.

365
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:23,318
- My God...
- Please.

366
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:26,632
Then, l promise We'll go home, okay?

367
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:39,710
- Money.
- What for?

368
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:45,474
Flowers, of course. What kind
of private eye are you?

369
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,876
Luigi dearest...

370
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,757
Poor Luigi.

371
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,228
Why aren't you With me anymore?

372
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:25,588
We have to go.

373
00:44:27,878 --> 00:44:30,028
Come on, now...

374
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,914
- lt can't be!
- lt is.

375
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:00,947
- When did this happen?
- One year and two days ago.

376
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,427
And you didn't let me know?!

377
00:45:03,518 --> 00:45:05,952
Not even that ass of your father!

378
00:45:06,398 --> 00:45:09,788
We know you're so busy, Professor,
running a hospital like this.

379
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:15,197
To think that When you Were a girl
and your father and l Were poor,

380
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:19,590
We used to plan how you and
my Francesco Would get married.

381
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:21,828
- Remember?
- Not very Well.

382
00:45:22,278 --> 00:45:26,476
He's grown into a giant, he still
hasn't graduated from college,

383
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:29,152
but he's a karate expert.

384
00:45:29,598 --> 00:45:33,477
Look What he did to my poor hand,
last Monday afternoon!

385
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:37,547
So Who did you settle on?

386
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:45,113
- Him! - Good afternoon.
- lsn't he ugly?

387
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:50,187
He isn't even rich,
but he's an incredible egoist.

388
00:45:50,397 --> 00:45:52,752
We're here for our Wedding present.

389
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:54,907
A year late,
but from you We expect it.

390
00:45:55,197 --> 00:45:57,267
Go on, l Want to make amends.

391
00:45:57,477 --> 00:46:01,709
Luigi Costa died about a month ago,
here in your hospital.

392
00:46:01,957 --> 00:46:05,347
- He Was supposed to have
been very sick. - Certainly, Costa.

393
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:10,992
l remember him.
He had been a priest at one time.

394
00:46:13,197 --> 00:46:14,949
Lung cancer.

395
00:46:16,597 --> 00:46:21,307
We'd like to know Where he's buried.
He Was a distant relative of mine.

396
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:26,956
- l haven't been able to find out.
- He Was buried here in Rimini.

397
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:28,311
He isn't here.

398
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:32,436
Don't tell me to go ask his sister:
the poor Woman knows less than me.

399
00:46:33,997 --> 00:46:37,626
l really don't know
how l can help you.

400
00:46:37,957 --> 00:46:41,711
- Maybe the police knows something.
- There's no need.

401
00:46:42,237 --> 00:46:44,353
There's nothing mysterious about it.

402
00:46:45,477 --> 00:46:48,786
A little secret between me
and the poor old man.

403
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:50,827
But if you're a relative...

404
00:46:51,036 --> 00:46:54,028
The last few years of his life,

405
00:46:54,796 --> 00:46:57,833
he Was affected
by a persecution complex.

406
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:02,387
He didn't Want to be buried here,
and he didn't Want it known Where.

407
00:47:04,396 --> 00:47:07,627
lt Was as though he Was afraid.

408
00:47:09,356 --> 00:47:12,746
lt Was supposed to remain
our secret.

409
00:47:13,716 --> 00:47:15,354
But instead...

410
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:21,996
He certainly chose a strange place,
the cemetery of Spina.

411
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:25,946
Luigi Costa? Did you try
the Etruscan necropolis?

412
00:47:26,716 --> 00:47:29,674
- Sometimes they make a mistake!
- Well?

413
00:47:35,796 --> 00:47:37,991
He's in the night club.

414
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:41,831
- Where did you say?
- lt has always been called that.

415
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:43,907
lt's a kind of underground place.

416
00:47:44,316 --> 00:47:48,673
Sorry l can't go With you, l'd have
done a rumba With the young lady!

417
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:52,195
Last chapel on the right!

418
00:48:14,115 --> 00:48:15,594
This is creepy!

419
00:48:16,955 --> 00:48:19,913
- Want to Wait for me outside?
- Are you kidding?

420
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:26,432
Here it is!
At last l get to see his face.

421
00:48:27,795 --> 00:48:30,832
- lt's strange, though...
- What?

422
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:34,394
They must've broken the tombstone
When they set it.

423
00:48:37,155 --> 00:48:40,511
ln fact they set it very recently.

424
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:43,185
The cement is still fresh.

425
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:44,828
While these...

426
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,074
Are at least two Weeks old,
if not more.

427
00:48:49,915 --> 00:48:54,306
Kind of hard to put flowers
on a gravestone before you set it.

428
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:02,673
ls it cold down here.

429
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:05,907
Come on, are We going or not?

430
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:11,108
- You know What he looked like!
- Go on up, l'll be right there.

431
00:49:11,194 --> 00:49:14,266
- Wait for me in the car.
- l can't Wait to go home.

432
00:49:59,114 --> 00:50:00,991
lt's empty!

433
00:51:51,552 --> 00:51:53,668
Here it is!
Tonight too, see.

434
00:51:53,832 --> 00:51:56,551
The sound and light are hooked up
to photo-electric cells,

435
00:51:56,632 --> 00:51:58,782
placed around the ground
under study. As you see,

436
00:51:58,872 --> 00:52:01,340
there's nothing visible moving.

437
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:04,749
Yet the sensometers scattered around
signal a presence,

438
00:52:04,832 --> 00:52:06,823
like somebody
Walking over the field.

439
00:52:06,912 --> 00:52:09,631
lt can't be small animals
because the sensometers

440
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:11,907
are set to react
only to a certain Weight.

441
00:52:11,992 --> 00:52:14,142
They're calibrated
for over a 100 pounds,

442
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:17,861
and no living creature exists small
enough to escape our TV cameras,

443
00:52:17,952 --> 00:52:20,147
With a specific mass that dense.

444
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:22,707
What's the temperature
of the ground now?

445
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:26,585
- lt's up nine degrees.
- And now?

446
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,785
- lt's still rising.
- lt's always the same.

447
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:36,822
The arrival of that presence in the
zone slowly raises the temperature.

448
00:52:36,912 --> 00:52:40,301
Every night at the same time,
and at dawn the effect disappears.

449
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:44,505
The data collected by Luigi Costa
Was extraordinarily precise.

450
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:52,380
Anyhow,
your suspicions Were correct.

451
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:55,231
The tomb is empty.
He isn't there.

452
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:58,829
- Now Where do We look for him?
- ln Bologna.

453
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:01,548
l have two classes.

454
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:05,703
Come on, hurry.
Let's take the highway.

455
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,866
- Dear Luigi Costa, We're
through With you! - What...

456
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:20,260
Spina. See What your book says.

457
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:35,546
The necropolis of Spina.
That's What that name reminded me of!

458
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:38,309
Go on, read more.

459
00:53:39,231 --> 00:53:42,109
lt Was founded around 530 B.C.

460
00:53:42,831 --> 00:53:46,221
lt Was heavily hellenized and
had its own treasury at Delphi.

461
00:53:46,311 --> 00:53:49,700
- What's that mean? - That they Were
in touch With the Delphic oracle.

462
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,705
The oracle of the dead?

463
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:56,027
The vast necropolis, Which
included a large number of tombs,

464
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,539
number that seems
inexplicable today,

465
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:01,098
given the scarcity
of the population...

466
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:03,545
- Zeder's K zones!
- What?

467
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:06,060
Professor Chesi
Was telling me about it.

468
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:10,383
According to this Zeder,
there exist special areas, K zones,

469
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,941
Which live in their own time,

470
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:16,625
Where it's possible to bring
those buried there back...

471
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,300
Back from the Beyond.

472
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,386
That may explain a lot of things,

473
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,705
like Why he Wanted
to be buried around here.

474
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:47,984
Here, this is
Where he Was years ago.

475
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,709
- How do you know?
- Don Mario told me.

476
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:54,908
And at his sister's house,
l saw a kind of certificate of merit

477
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,981
With the name of this camp.
- How sad it is!

478
00:54:58,589 --> 00:55:01,149
Just think
of all the children here once.

479
00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:05,338
Right down the road
from the necropolis, see?

480
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:07,779
And you Want me to drop this story?

481
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:10,588
Listen, let's ask that guy.

482
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:14,699
- What? - How We get back
to Bologna, What else?

483
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:27,981
Excuse me, Where's
the highway for Bologna?

484
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:31,141
Turn there, take your second right.
lt's a couple miles down.

485
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:33,904
Thanks. Let's go.

486
00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:43,627
- l feel like l've got to stay.
- Stay here?

487
00:55:44,269 --> 00:55:47,978
To do What?
How can you Want to stay here?

488
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:52,423
l have to understand
What this is all about.

489
00:55:53,749 --> 00:55:56,468
There are too many things
that don't make sense.

490
00:55:56,589 --> 00:55:58,341
A heap of strange things...

491
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:01,944
The only strange one
around here is you.

492
00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:04,580
Come on, let's go!

493
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:08,266
l'm staying.
That's all there is to it.

494
00:56:10,428 --> 00:56:13,022
l guess you Want me
to hitchhike back to Bologna,

495
00:56:14,068 --> 00:56:17,902
seeing as how you're interested
in all the stupidity in the World,

496
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:19,660
except me.

497
00:56:19,868 --> 00:56:21,859
Take the car.

498
00:56:22,188 --> 00:56:25,066
You're a nut!
A crazy, selfish nut!

499
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:29,622
Go to hell!

500
00:56:34,388 --> 00:56:36,424
Had a fight, didn't you?

501
00:56:36,548 --> 00:56:40,063
No, it's just that l'm doing
some research about this place.

502
00:56:40,428 --> 00:56:43,943
There, and she doesn't Want to.

503
00:56:46,148 --> 00:56:49,345
- You know how Women are.
- l know something about them.

504
00:56:49,588 --> 00:56:51,624
l got a mother Who's a real terror.

505
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,506
- What are you studying, ruins?
- Ruins.

506
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:57,788
- This is a motel!
- And a restaurant too.

507
00:56:57,868 --> 00:57:00,428
But When they finish up there,
We'll have to close.

508
00:57:00,548 --> 00:57:03,460
- Are they making it into a hotel?
- You bet.

509
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:07,143
These Frenchies, over a thousand
rooms, all With colour TV.

510
00:57:07,308 --> 00:57:10,778
We got a dozen rooms and
can't rent one for love or money.

511
00:57:10,868 --> 00:57:14,497
- And those guys are putting up
a thousand! - l'll rent one.

512
00:57:15,908 --> 00:57:19,263
lf you're into ruins,
this here's the oldest ruin in Spina!

513
00:57:19,347 --> 00:57:22,384
Mirko, fill 'er up
and take a look at the oil.

514
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:26,142
Benni, there's a stranger here
Who's heard a lot about you.

515
00:57:26,307 --> 00:57:28,298
Are you one of those nuts
from up there?

516
00:57:28,387 --> 00:57:31,106
No, l'm doing some research
on What Went on here.

517
00:57:31,187 --> 00:57:33,621
l Will tell you everything
for a beer.

518
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:37,626
- Questions? - No, l just Wondered
What you knew about that place.

519
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:40,105
l know What everybody knows.

520
00:57:40,307 --> 00:57:44,744
That it Was a holiday camp
up to '56, When they closed it.

521
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:49,225
- Then? - Nothing until three
years ago, When the nudists came.

522
00:57:49,307 --> 00:57:53,061
The ones Who go around
With their cheeks out...

523
00:57:53,947 --> 00:57:57,223
- What happened? - So these
perverts, that's What they are,

524
00:57:57,387 --> 00:58:02,541
are all lying on the beach,
When a dog of theirs dies.

525
00:58:02,627 --> 00:58:05,460
So What do you think they do?
They bury it there.

526
00:58:05,587 --> 00:58:06,986
So they leave.

527
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,059
Every night anybody Who Went
by there risked his life.

528
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:15,546
They found old Luisa With her throat
ripped to pieces.

529
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:20,176
So one morning We go in there
With our shotguns,

530
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:23,225
me and six or eight others,

531
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:29,186
and one of those long-hairs tells us
Where they buried the mutt.

532
00:58:29,746 --> 00:58:33,898
We dig him up,
he Was a good six feet under.

533
00:58:33,986 --> 00:58:36,102
And What else do We find?

534
00:58:36,466 --> 00:58:40,584
He had the pair of garden shears
that belonged to old Luisa

535
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,975
stuck in his neck.

536
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,858
We pulled him out of there.

537
00:58:45,226 --> 00:58:49,663
He'd been dead at least three months
and still Wasn't rotting!

538
00:58:51,146 --> 00:58:55,583
So We threw him in garbage dump,
it Was all over.

539
00:58:56,306 --> 00:59:02,336
That's Why l say those Frenchies
building that hotel are nuts!

540
00:59:02,866 --> 00:59:05,175
Don't you pay Benni no mind!

541
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:07,901
Go on and laugh!

542
00:59:09,826 --> 00:59:14,741
But l Wouldn't spend a night in a
place like this for a million bucks!

543
01:00:28,305 --> 01:00:30,580
- What are you doing here?
- And you?

544
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,979
l often come here.
l like it.

545
01:00:35,185 --> 01:00:38,939
Besides, our parish Was once
in charge of this camp's functions.

546
01:00:39,505 --> 01:00:42,338
- Luigi Costa came here too.
- Him too.

547
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:45,574
You know something
you don't Want to tell me.

548
01:00:45,665 --> 01:00:49,213
We priests never tell lies.
lt's in the contract.

549
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:53,460
Lies, no.
But not talking isn't lying.

550
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:57,060
Here's my alibi.

551
01:00:59,464 --> 01:01:02,900
You mean to say you come
all the Way from Bologna for those?

552
01:01:03,544 --> 01:01:06,058
Poor Don Emidio enjoys them so much.

553
01:01:07,304 --> 01:01:09,340
But you enjoy something else.

554
01:01:09,424 --> 01:01:12,496
l like trying to understand
man and his mysteries.

555
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:16,334
A priest leaves the Church
after a lifetime of sacrifice,

556
01:01:16,744 --> 01:01:19,178
only a few yards
from the finish line,

557
01:01:19,264 --> 01:01:21,175
in sight of the big prize.

558
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:24,736
- ln exchange for What?
- The promise of a return?

559
01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:27,055
Maybe the promise of a return.

560
01:01:28,504 --> 01:01:32,213
Here We are talking like two
imbeciles and l've got a service.

561
01:01:36,584 --> 01:01:38,700
l'd like to see you again, to talk.

562
01:01:38,784 --> 01:01:40,775
Sure, but in Bologna.

563
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,379
Go away from here.

564
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:45,774
Leave this business to us
professionals of the supernatural.

565
01:01:47,224 --> 01:01:47,895
Come in.

566
01:01:49,344 --> 01:01:52,416
- ls that you?
- Yes. Did you Want to see me?

567
01:01:52,744 --> 01:01:54,302
l've thought about it a lot.

568
01:01:54,384 --> 01:01:58,058
You have to tell Stefano to give
that letter to the police.

569
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,611
They stole it from him.
He hasn't got it anymore.

570
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:03,661
Better. Then maybe
l'm Worrying about nothing.

571
01:02:03,743 --> 01:02:05,654
l have these strange forebodings...

572
01:02:05,743 --> 01:02:08,701
My husband isn't doing anything.

573
01:02:08,903 --> 01:02:13,931
l don't Want anything to happen.
Please, make him go to the police.

574
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:20,536
l recognize you.

575
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:28,096
Where are you?

576
01:02:38,783 --> 01:02:40,535
Where are you hiding?

577
01:03:45,342 --> 01:03:47,617
What are you
standing in the dark for?

578
01:03:59,862 --> 01:04:02,330
Chesi advises you
to go to the police.

579
01:04:02,502 --> 01:04:05,300
- You should at least
talk to our friend. - Guido?

580
01:04:05,462 --> 01:04:07,180
Right, Guido.

581
01:04:14,902 --> 01:04:17,461
- God...
- lt's useless to read it.

582
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:20,381
lt Was a real accident,
nothing suspicious.

583
01:04:20,661 --> 01:04:22,652
Do you see Why l came back?

584
01:04:23,061 --> 01:04:25,017
Guido is dead, Stefano!

585
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:27,780
l Was scared
to stay alone in the house.

586
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:40,020
So l grabbed all the things
We might need and here l am.

587
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:49,093
For a moment l had the sensation
he Was interested in my research.

588
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:53,289
- How?
- No...

589
01:04:55,221 --> 01:04:56,859
lt Was nothing.

590
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:00,979
A stupid coincidence, that's all.

591
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:06,329
Come on, let's do something fun.

592
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:08,454
Come on, please.

593
01:05:11,861 --> 01:05:14,853
- We Were in school together.
- Don't think.

594
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:20,932
You sure couldn't find
a more suicidal room than this.

595
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:22,659
At least turn on the light.

596
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:29,768
What is it?

597
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:35,654
What is it?

598
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,413
Here's What it is!

599
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,172
How can it be?

600
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,379
You said it yourself:

601
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,891
a special kind of typewriter,

602
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,813
fairly rare...

603
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,732
And here, What do We find
a few yards from the holiday camp?

604
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,415
The cord!

605
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,456
Don't tell me it's a coincidence.

606
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,179
Luigi Costa lived here,
in this hotel.

607
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,892
Maybe in this very room...

608
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,697
My friend Carla says

609
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,176
making love makes the fear pass.

610
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,494
You kids, get out of here!
Do you hear me?!

611
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,655
Did a certain Luigi Costa
ever stay here?

612
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,299
How do l know?
We just started running this place.

613
01:06:37,379 --> 01:06:41,338
lf you ask me, it Would've been
better to forget the Whole thing.

614
01:06:41,419 --> 01:06:43,887
l see
you and the girl up there.

615
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:45,692
That's a good-looking chick.

616
01:06:45,779 --> 01:06:49,852
Ones like her are hard to come by
around here. Where do you find them?

617
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:53,488
- Want me to bring you up
some breakfast? - No, it's okay.

618
01:06:53,819 --> 01:06:55,650
ls there a Watchman in there?

619
01:06:55,739 --> 01:06:58,378
There Was, but they fired him
When they took over.

620
01:06:59,299 --> 01:07:02,848
There must be somebody...
Last night there Was a light on.

621
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:05,169
Sure, With all
the machinery they brought.

622
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:10,056
- What machinery? - Scientific stuff,
to do their research With.

623
01:07:10,779 --> 01:07:13,612
l know, l Watched them unload
through my Super Visor.

624
01:07:14,019 --> 01:07:15,975
- Your What?
- My Super Visor.

625
01:07:20,859 --> 01:07:22,975
l got it from a mail-order catalogue.

626
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:25,573
When the nudists Were here,
it really came in handy!

627
01:07:25,819 --> 01:07:28,538
l spend hours up there,
messing With that gadget.

628
01:07:28,939 --> 01:07:31,976
- What did you see?
- lt's no use looking.

629
01:07:32,059 --> 01:07:34,937
You can't see anything now.
They took it all inside.

630
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:38,091
- What? - l don't know.
l thought they Were making a movie.

631
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:41,251
They had these TV cameras
and lights...

632
01:07:42,019 --> 01:07:45,489
- And they never come down here?
- Never, not even for coffee.

633
01:07:45,739 --> 01:07:48,457
- Nobody better try to go in there!
- Why?

634
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:52,327
They say they put up
a kind of electrified fence.

635
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:54,813
But there's a Way to get in,
anyway.

636
01:07:55,098 --> 01:07:58,773
- How? - When We Were kids,
We snuck in to steal fruit,

637
01:07:58,858 --> 01:08:01,975
even past a guard
With a shotgun full of buckshot.

638
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:05,528
- The hell We Were going through
the gate. - How did you get in?

639
01:08:05,618 --> 01:08:08,212
There Were Germans here
during the War rounding people up.

640
01:08:08,298 --> 01:08:10,334
But some found
a Way to save themselves.

641
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:01,728
Let's go!

642
01:12:19,295 --> 01:12:22,367
- l'll go get another one.
- Never mind, it stopped.

643
01:13:54,533 --> 01:13:56,842
His face, on the screen!

644
01:13:59,373 --> 01:14:02,046
lt Was White, cadaverous...

645
01:14:03,453 --> 01:14:04,806
He looked dead to me.

646
01:14:05,853 --> 01:14:07,252
And then this.

647
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:10,609
Did you tell that giant
to come in here With all that stuff?

648
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:13,924
Come on, Who cares?
l'm telling you about insane things!

649
01:14:14,013 --> 01:14:16,368
- Sorry.
- Now, listen.

650
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:22,243
l need you to go to Professor Chesi
With this videotape, right away.

651
01:14:22,893 --> 01:14:25,327
He must have a videotape machine
at the university,

652
01:14:25,413 --> 01:14:27,131
or else he can get one.

653
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:31,489
lf only a small part
of What l think is on it,

654
01:14:31,973 --> 01:14:35,443
We finally have proof and
you can take it to the police.

655
01:14:37,733 --> 01:14:39,564
Then all this Will be over.

656
01:14:40,093 --> 01:14:42,288
Okay? l can't leave.

657
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,965
l have to make sure
they don't take everything away.

658
01:14:47,972 --> 01:14:49,485
Then it Would be impossible.

659
01:14:52,012 --> 01:14:54,162
Washed, greased
and With an oil change!

660
01:14:54,412 --> 01:14:55,242
Thanks.

661
01:14:58,772 --> 01:15:00,967
- lt doesn't start.
- Come on!

662
01:15:01,612 --> 01:15:03,728
Let me try. Go out.

663
01:15:07,412 --> 01:15:09,528
- Damn...
- See?

664
01:15:09,612 --> 01:15:12,365
- What did you do to it?
- Me? Nothing.

665
01:15:12,492 --> 01:15:16,280
l changed the oil. l figured it could
use it, it Was smoking so much.

666
01:15:16,372 --> 01:15:19,921
- Now, What? - ls there a Way
to get to the train station?

667
01:15:20,012 --> 01:15:22,128
My motorbike,
in ten minutes We'll be there.

668
01:15:29,772 --> 01:15:32,764
Well,
promise you'll be careful.

669
01:15:32,852 --> 01:15:35,412
- Don't go back in there, okay?
- Promise.

670
01:15:48,852 --> 01:15:52,322
Hello, this is urgent.
l need to talk to Don Mario.

671
01:15:52,492 --> 01:15:56,882
l Wish l knew Where he Was!
We haven't seen him since yesterday.

672
01:15:57,011 --> 01:16:01,163
l called the hospitals, l Was just
about to call the police now.

673
01:16:01,251 --> 01:16:03,207
Who's calling?

674
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,405
Hi!

675
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:49,042
Excuse me, they called from the
hospital to say my mother Was bad.

676
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:51,479
The only one Who can take me
is Mirko.

677
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:53,800
l don't know if l'll be back
tomorrow morning.

678
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:57,166
lf anything comes up, you can
always reach us at this number.

679
01:17:57,450 --> 01:18:00,089
- Feel free to use the bar.
- Thank you.

680
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:02,201
- Good evening.
- Good night.

681
01:19:08,489 --> 01:19:11,686
- Hello? - Alessandra stopped by
and told me the Whole story.

682
01:19:12,009 --> 01:19:15,524
Then l saw that tape you sent me.
What is it, some kind of a joke?

683
01:19:15,609 --> 01:19:18,885
- lt's completely blank.
- Crazy things are happening here.

684
01:19:19,089 --> 01:19:21,557
- l think l saw Luigi Costa...
- Who?

685
01:19:21,649 --> 01:19:24,288
The ex-priest... Never mind,
you Wouldn't understand.

686
01:19:24,409 --> 01:19:27,127
- l think We better call the police!
- l'll take care of it.

687
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:30,166
All right,
but have them come right away.

688
01:19:30,368 --> 01:19:32,643
- Keep Alessandra With you.
- Stay calm.

689
01:19:32,728 --> 01:19:35,003
Stay Where you are
and don't do anything.

690
01:19:35,088 --> 01:19:36,965
l'll be there as soon as possible.

691
01:19:38,168 --> 01:19:40,807
Hello? Hello?!

692
01:19:44,168 --> 01:19:47,763
He has to be taken care of and
that body has got to be disinterred.

693
01:19:47,848 --> 01:19:49,076
Everything's ready.

694
01:20:01,528 --> 01:20:03,166
Who's there?

695
01:20:08,608 --> 01:20:10,200
You may as Well give up.

696
01:20:10,768 --> 01:20:13,441
- They cut you off, didn't you?
- How do you know?

697
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:16,686
You're screwed, friend.
We're screwed.

698
01:20:17,728 --> 01:20:19,320
That's not What l'm here for.

699
01:20:20,168 --> 01:20:24,002
l came to tell you they already left
their calling card.

700
01:20:29,328 --> 01:20:30,602
Come on.

701
01:20:32,608 --> 01:20:36,964
Everybody says l'm crazy. Just
look here, if l'm a little crazy.

702
01:20:48,087 --> 01:20:52,524
We got to try and dig up
that ex-priest quick,

703
01:20:53,367 --> 01:20:57,963
and get him out of that ground,
if We still hope to save ourselves.

704
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:19,677
l don't think l'm going to make it.

705
01:21:20,687 --> 01:21:23,201
l really don't think
l can go any further.

706
01:21:23,287 --> 01:21:25,164
We better go back.

707
01:21:29,367 --> 01:21:31,164
Stop! Come back!

708
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:34,235
What do you try to do?
Come back, son.

709
01:23:29,365 --> 01:23:31,640
Unbury him...
Unbury him!

710
01:23:32,365 --> 01:23:35,801
Unbury him...
Pull him out of that ground.

711
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:38,001
For the love of God!

712
01:27:01,802 --> 01:27:04,475
- Where's the machine?
- Over there.

713
01:27:04,562 --> 01:27:08,316
- Please, sit on.
- Good morning.

714
01:27:10,122 --> 01:27:14,559
Some little inconveniences that We
Will call accidents along the Way,

715
01:27:15,082 --> 01:27:18,597
have forced us to temporarily
suspend the experiment on that site.

716
01:27:19,002 --> 01:27:21,994
But We are now in possession
of such exceptional confirmation

717
01:27:22,082 --> 01:27:26,519
to suppose that, in a near future,
the situation Will be under control.

718
01:27:26,882 --> 01:27:30,033
We don't feel the sacrifice
of our two valorous colleagues

719
01:27:30,122 --> 01:27:32,238
in the name of science Was in vain.

720
01:27:32,322 --> 01:27:35,712
That ground is the most fertile
K zone yet identified.

721
01:27:36,521 --> 01:27:40,912
l remind you l came to know of
this place, together With Dr. Melis,

722
01:27:41,001 --> 01:27:45,438
on the indication of a remarkable
man, somebody from the place:

723
01:27:45,521 --> 01:27:48,433
a certain Luigi Costa, an ex-priest.

724
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,793
Wake up!

725
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,752
Come on, Wake up.
