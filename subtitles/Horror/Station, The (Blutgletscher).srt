Come on, what would happen?

173
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,531
I'd have to make a phone call.

You'd have to make a phone call?

Right. I'm sure there's a whorehouse

Well, that's a good thing, right?

382
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,151
Katherine, when you send a broadcast

383
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,695
you're sending out these numbers
to the agents in the field

384
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,990
to deliver specific assignments they cannot
trust to normal communication lines.

385
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,158
Do you know what that means?

386
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,162
Fifteen broadcasts.

387
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,333

00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,352
Here, what does it say?

393
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,436
Can't read that.

394
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:00,360
Agents in the field carry,
like, one-time notebooks, like pads.

395
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,154
Each page is a new cypher.

396
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,531
When you broadcast something,

397
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,534
the agent matches up the first set
of numbers to the page in the notebook.

398
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,037
Now he knows he's using this page,
and this page only, to decode the message.

399
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,039
When he's done, he destroys the page.

400
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,876
So we send another broadcast
to cancel this one.

401
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,546
Every cypher's a one-time deal.

402
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,215
Totally random.

403
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,677
Completely impossible to crack the code
unless you have the original cypher.

404
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,388
That changes with every shift.

405
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,098
So we need the cypher?

But what I know,
the reason that I'm not shaking

423
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,468
is because this is a choice
not dictated by emotion.

But whatever they're looking for,
it's on this, so can you?

489
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,579
Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it.

490
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,253
Who's this?

491
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,344
Oh, it's the Director of
Clandestine Operations Overseas.

492
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:29,100
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.

493
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,518
Director Atwater.

494
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,854
Director Collins.

495
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,647
Templeman.

496
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,607
Keep going.

497
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,154
Yeah, these are people being groomed
for top slots in the corporation.

498
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,823
Go back, go back.

499
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,660
I know that man. That's my fucking boss.

500
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,748
Fifteen dossiers.

501
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,583
Fifteen broadcasts.

502
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,335
There it is.

503
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,881
If I wanted to cripple the system
in one fell swoop,

504
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,175
these would be the 15 I'd start with.

505
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,843
You kill these men today,

506
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,179
you won't recognize the world
when you wake up in the morning.

507
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:10,391
But they've already sent the broadcasts.
I mean, what the hell do they want with us?

508
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,895
They wanna kill us.
Make sure you don't cancel the broadcasts.

509
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,149
Grab that. Let's go.

510
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,589
Here.

511
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,511
That's all the information from the laptop,
in case, uh...

512
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,846
I don't know, in case we don't get out of here.

513
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,890

Don't you worry about a thing. "

You ever get used to it?

516
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,735
Used to what?

517
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,572
Bodies. Dead people. Seeing them.

518
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,865
No.

519
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,785
They never seem to stay dead.
How's it going over there?

520

There's stuff on here,
but it's password protected.

Can you just talk to me?

529

Yeah, what do you wanna talk about?

530
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,653
Anything. Just regular stuff.
Like what normal people talk about.

531
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,698
- Not really my strong suit, Katherine.
- I'll start.

(SIGHS)

533

How do you know I dropped out of college?

534

Oh, that was just a lucky guess.

535
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,916
Grabbed my file or something?

536
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,712
- You fit a profile.
- Of what?

537
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:06,883
Civilian broadcasters have a certain,
you know, personality trait.

538
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,801
Keep working.

539
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,930
Well, I can't work in silence,
so you might as well just entertain me.

540
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:13,973
Okay.

541
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,352
A troubled childhood with an emphasis
on extreme emotional loss or fatigue.

542
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,605
Death of a parent. Sometimes sexual abuse.

543
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,815
Lack of a strong authority figure
in adolescence.

544
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,861
Low self-esteem resulting in
few permanent relationships. Defensive.

545
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,113
Rebellious. Highly intelligent.

546
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,950
Susceptible to being stuck in one position,
environment or occupation

547
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,410
for long periods of time.

548
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,746
Wow... Yeah, you're terrible at this.

549
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,664
How about your profile?

550
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,500
Indifferent and emotionally detached
from reality.

551
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,795
Inability to communicate with any other
human being on the face of this Earth.

552
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,174
Willing to sit silently in one place
for hours at a time.

553
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,761
Make sure that you have a plan
to kill every person that you ever meet.

554
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:55,348
No. Close.

555
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,515
No, I had a stable childhood

556
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,685
but with an underlying desire
to break free from control or authority.

557
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,104
Restless. Sense of self-entitlement.

558
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,982
Striking lack of empathy
or compassion for other people.

559
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,693
- Bordering between autism...
- Stop.

560
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:15,284
You know, I, um, didn't always do this.
This is my first station assignment.

561
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,998
I was on the other end of the numbers.

562
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,546
Looking at nine million
black-book tax dollars.

563
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,929
Recruited me straight out of college.

564
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,764
Said it was the best opportunity I'd ever have.

565
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,061
Told me I'd do special things,
important things.

566
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,149
Well, you're worth more than

567
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:51,529

on a piece of paper 20 years ago.

568
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,697
Hmm...

569
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,868
All they're really talking
about is what's real. Reality.

570
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,454
They know how to use it. They're good at it.

571
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,958
- Why not quit?
- (CHUCKLES)

Yeah. Yeah.

I knew a guy once,
and he decided he wanted to quit.

574
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,884
He squirreled away money for
about 20 years and he opened up a bar

575
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,762
and wanted to create a new life,

576
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,808
and he survived about 37 months.

577
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,226
They killed him?

578
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,686
No, I did.

01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:36,322
Broken pieces. They push us.

809
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:38,908
Make us into men we're not.

810
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:41,953
And then complain
when we no longer function.

811
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:46,082
They think we should live like this is normal.

812
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:49,085
Like this is how we should behave,
how we should think.

813
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,547
And our reward for this life?

814
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:56,634
We try to run away and they kill us because
of what they forced inside our heads.

815
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,719
You think men like that deserve to live?

816
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:03,057
They deserve everything they got coming.

817
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,642
Maybe.

818
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:08,646
Did you stop the broadcasts?

819
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:11,649
Yeah.

820
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,027
Why?

821
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:20,616
Some fleeting virtue in not being
a mass murderer.

822
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:30,418
I take it you're not a religious man?
You don't believe in a guiding light?

823
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:31,502
No.

824
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:35,965
You're like me, then. Floundering in wet shit.

825
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,174
Yeah.

826
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,596
How long do you think we can go on like this?

So, you told me she was dead.

836
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,980
Look, tell me.

837
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,527
Burnt down, a man's worth $4.40.

838
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,904
- Excuse me?
- That's what you said.

839
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:29,323
- When?
- In the car.

840

When all's said and done, you know,
carbon and minerals.

842
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:39,375
- I said that?
- Uh-huh.

843
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,878
Well, you know me, I talk a lot of shit.

844
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:46,423
But if you say I said it, then I suppose
I should believe you. What about it?

845
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,508
Hmm...

846
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,594
We walk. Both of us.

847
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:59,270
Well, you might walk but her...
That's impossible.

848
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,605
She knows too much.

849
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:06,110
She's got the codes. She's got the cypher.
She's compromised.

850
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,029
It's gotta stop.

851
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:11,907
I'll get you a prescription for Ativan.

852
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:13,617
That will stop your conscience bothering you.

853
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,703
Yeah. Well, take a look at that.

854

It's a copy of the broadcasts.

855

The ones she stopped.

856
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:26,297
Number 14 might be of interest. It's you.

Gotta be worth more than five bucks.

What do you want?

859
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:48,152
Give me a week. Ten days.

860
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,697
And I'll find your bodies at the station?

861
01:21:52,532 --> 01:21:53,949
You'll find enough.
