1
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:31,917
AFGHANISTAN, 1981

2
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:36,292
THE SECOND YEAR
OF THE RUSSIAN INVASION

3
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,750
Spread out.

4
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,708
Spread out.

5
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,375
Move it.

6
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,583
Get your weapon out, Golikov.

7
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,833
Kaminski.

8
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,250
Move it.

9
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,667
Over here, over here.

10
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,583
Kaminski.

11
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,458
<i>- T5447, what's your status?
- Mopping up, almost done.</i>

12
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,542
<i>All units rejoin the column.</i>

13
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,000
I got them.

14
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,542
Did you get them sheep?
There's only a couple left...

15
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,583
<i>T5447. Roger, six.</i>

16
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:43,042
- Behind this building over there-
- Got a souvenir!

17
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,125
Give me the flamethrower.

18
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,167
What you got?

19
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,750
- Come to me! Over this way!
- On my way.

20
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,875
Golikov, come on over here.
Bring that cyanide.

21
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:01,083
Where's the extra satchels?

22
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,875
Molotov!

23
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,208
I'm burning!

24
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,208
- You owe me.
- Bring him.

25
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,792
Come on, get his arm.
Come on, come on!

26
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,083
Move it!

27
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:59,875
You son of a bitch! You're dead!

28
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,583
Put him under the track.

29
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:24,583
- Get your feet under there.
- Do you want me to kick him?

30
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,208
You can't kill my friends!

31
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:32,417
- Mount and crank it up.
- We're gonna squash you like a grape.

32
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,750
Ask him where the other rebels are.

33
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,083
Where are the rebels?

34
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,000
Mujahedeen are all around you!

35
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,500
Ten Russian dogs will die
for every Afghan!

36
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,000
- What did he say?
- He does not know, sir.

37
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,292
Tell them to stop!

38
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,250
No further!

39
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,500
Let him go!

40
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:04,167
Sherina! I order you away from here!

41
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:09,708
Bitch!

42
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,667
This commander prefers
bullets to words. Go!

43
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,542
Traitor!

44
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:20,125
Tell your shit eater of a
commander to let him go!

45
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:26,833
Sir, these women humbly beg you
for the prisoner, sir.

46
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:33,292
You tell them to watch
what happens to rebels.

47
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,250
Do it, Koverchenko.

48
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,167
He is to be my husband!

49
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,375
No Russian will escape Afghanistan!

50
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,583
Forward!

51
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,042
Forward!

52
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,458
Allah is the only God...!

53
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,042
<i>- Directions, sir?
- Right fork.</i>

54
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:54,917
<i>- What?
- Right fork.</i>

55
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:00,292
<i>- Sir, you sure?
- I said right fork. Do you copy?</i>

56
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,750
<i>- Yes, sir.
- T5447, do you copy?</i>

57
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,833
<i>- What's your position?
- Why can't they hear us?</i>

58
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,583
<i>T5447, do you copy?</i>

59
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,292
The tank is lost.

60
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,875
No...

61
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,833
We need help.

62
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,125
Taj...

63
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,417
Uncle...

64
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,958
Come on.

65
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,083
Uncle... why?

66
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:04,500
Retaliation.

67
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,042
Be his mother.

68
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,333
Moustafa!

69
00:15:12,917 --> 00:15:14,583
Salaam, Taj Mohamed.

70
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,333
Cousin, truce.

71
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,917
Greetings, uncle.

72
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:42,917
I always said, have faith in
Allah and keep a hidden pistol.

73
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,292
Every part of me
screams to see your blood.

74
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:49,208
Nothing has changed
between us, then.

75
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,458
Taj...

76
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:54,250
...your father would never
dishonor a truce.

77
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,000
What do you want here?

78
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,542
A tank that killed your people
is lost in the valley of the Jackal.

79
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:06,000
I know that valley.

80
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,125
It only has one way in and out.

81
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,250
I come to call upon your
honor to avenge Afghanistan.

82
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,958
When Moustafa talks of honor...

83
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,208
...the end of the world is at hand.

84
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,792
Cousin, uncle, we are tired
of this ancient vendetta.

85
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,875
Let us take revenge together...
We divide the booty.

86
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:36,042
I will not fight with a scavenger...

87
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,917
...who picks gold from the
teeth of dead Russians.

88
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,750
Then run to Pakistan.

89
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,458
I would speak with the Khan.

90
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:50,125
My father was killed.

91
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,917
My brother Shahzaman is now Khan.

92
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,167
Your brother was martyred
by a Russian tank.

93
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,333
You are now Khan, Taj Mohamed.

94
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:28,167
My Khan, we would fight with
you to avenge Shahzaman.

95
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,042
With this we can destroy the tank!

96
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,750
I know how to work it!

97
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,167
What do you say, Taj?

98
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,958
Your brother did not go to
Pakistan... He went to Paradise.

99
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,458
Allah...

100
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:03,417
Give me a man to tear apart.

101
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,625
From this time forth...

102
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:10,125
I am a stone in your sling!

103
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,542
Revenge!

104
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,542
- I don't see a village.
- I can't raise them.

105
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,833
- Shit!
- Come on!

106
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,292
- Sir?
- Where the hell are we?

107
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,292
I don't know, sir.

108
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,375
- Where's the Kandahar Road?
- "m not sure, sir.

109
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:31,333
The Molotov took our radio out.
We can receive but not transmit.

110
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,417
Those hills must be here.

111
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:48,208
- Is Kandahar on the other side?
- "m not sure.

112
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:53,208
- Base coordinates are 31 degrees-
- You're relieved of your post.

113
00:19:53,417 --> 00:19:56,042
- Give the log to Koverchenko.
- Why?

114
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,083
- Incompetence.
- What's my function?

115
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:02,667
None. Give yourself
a medal, Koverchenko.

116
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,333
- For what?
- Trying to save those tankers.

117
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,708
- Check this side out.
- To your post!

118
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:18,417
Just say, "Yes, sir"
and keep out of his way.

119
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:23,667
- Why'd that rebel laugh at me?
- It wasn't at you, he was happy.

120
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,417
You die in a holy war,
you go to paradise.

121
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,333
You believe that?

122
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,083
After university,
"m not sure what I believe.

123
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,625
I need a woman!

124
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:58,792
- Maybe you'll find another sheep.
- Maybe.

125
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,708
- Kaminski, turn that music off.
- Golikov put it on, sir.

126
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,208
Shit!

127
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,917
Come here,
I got something to show you.

128
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,458
- Under siege!
- Driver, crank it up!

129
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,333
Gunner!

130
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,833
Troops on the ridge!

131
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,917
Turn power!

132
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:50,833
- Range?
- Three-zero-zero!

133
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,667
What's wrong?

134
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,917
Get it out of here!

135
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:05,208
- Ready to roll.
- Rock forward, go. Go!

136
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,500
- Heads up, Samad.
- Traversing!

137
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:21,000
Up!

138
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,125
- Fire.
- On the way.

139
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,333
Let's go!

140
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,750
You said you could kill
the tank in one shot!

141
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,750
Maybe it is not the will of Allah.

142
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,917
Or maybe you are a bad shot!

143
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,833
I am Khan!

144
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:08,708
I demand to be the one
to explode the tank!

145
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,750
Give me the RPG!

146
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,958
Your nephew is a hothead, uncle.

147
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,667
We all stay together!

148
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:27,000
Taj...

149
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,958
Who calls himself Khan is not a Khan.

150
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,750
Patience, Taj.

151
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,667
This is your trial.

152
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,458
Uncle?

153
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:42,458
It's nothing. A scratch.

154
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,167
Come...

155
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:50,625
Allah gives us tracks to follow.

156
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:57,125
Khanzaman! Afzal! Come on!

157
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,667
Only one drank the water, Samad!

158
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:36,458
I told you to throw
that canister far away.

159
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,292
At my command, gunner. Frag.

160
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,875
Move, move, move. Move it.

161
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,708
- Frag is up.
- Fire.

162
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,375
On the way.

163
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,667
- Misfire.
- Go to manual.

164
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,542
- Misfire.
- Out of the tank!

165
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:26,167
- What happened?
- Misfire. I know it's gonna blow.

166
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,625
The shell looked okay to me.

167
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,083
Samad, did you touch that shell?

168
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:36,333
Yes, sir.

169
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:41,208
I just handed it-
I handed it to Golikov, sir.

170
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,542
Misfires happen, sir.
One in every hundred rounds. Cook-off.

171
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:53,792
It's the loader's
responsibility to unload.

172
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,292
Golikov.

173
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,667
I've never handled a cook-off before.

174
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,292
I will do it, sir.

175
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:12,667
He doesn't know what he's doing, sir.
Let me go.

176
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:19,667
- All right. Kaminski.
- Sir?

177
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:24,458
Pinpoint the mujas.
Don't take your eyes off them.

178
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,875
Koverchenko, Golikov.

179
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:21,458
Sir, maybe I ought to do this.
What if something happens?

180
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Then Kaminski will have
his first command.

181
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:35,000
Just tell me one thing.

182
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:38,083
Why do you stick up for the Afghan?

183
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:42,125
Because he's doing the best he can.

184
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:44,875
That's what worries me.

185
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:51,167
You've got what it takes.
"ve seen it.

186
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:54,042
Just keep your head on straight.

187
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:00,708
Why don't we just fight?

188
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:05,750
Because they could put a hole
right through us with that RPG.

189
00:29:29,958 --> 00:29:31,167
What happened?

190
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:35,333
They're gone.
Samad just saved their lives.

191
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,708
I didn't do anything.

192
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:43,625
- Booby-trap that round.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,375
Come on, come on.

194
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:04,208
- Get us out of here.
- Moving tank.

195
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:59,417
We bleed because we are weak
for Russian junk.

196
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,208
Your mujahed has no chance to live.

197
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:11,917
Our uncle is wounded too.
Let him stay here with Noor.

198
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:16,417
My wound will heal
when I see the tank explode.

199
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,792
We leave him food and water.

200
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,125
God is great.

201
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,250
Another grave.

202
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,833
The wind covers the tank tracks...
we want to return to the village.

203
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:54,417
<i>You have no village - only "Badal"!</i>

204
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:35,542
A Holy Man.

205
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:48,958
David! You have come!

206
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:55,000
Prophet Mohamed bid me build
a fire to light your way.

207
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,917
God willing, with only a stone
you will slay The Beast, David!

208
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:01,708
What Beast?

209
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,833
Goliath!

210
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,458
Look Taj... tank tracks!

211
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,708
Build a fire, sir?

212
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:39,500
I'm sure you lost
those muja fucks, sir.

213
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,292
- Tend to the track, Kaminski.
- You got it, sir.

214
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,708
Let me hit that.

215
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:59,792
<i>It is Pushtunwali.
It's the code of honor.</i>

216
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:04,000
<i>- Pushtunwali.
- Three obligations.</i>

217
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:07,542
<i>First, melmastia: hospitality.</i>

218
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,375
<i>Melmastia.</i>

219
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:12,833
<i>Second, badal: revenge.</i>

220
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:17,333
<i>- Badal.
- Third, nanawatai:</i>

221
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:22,542
The obligation to give sanctuary
to all those who ask.

222
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,458
- To all?
- All.

223
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,292
- Even the enemy?
- All.

224
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:32,208
What if I kill your brother?

225
00:35:32,792 --> 00:35:35,958
<i>And you come for badal, revenge...</i>

226
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,333
<i>...and I ask for nanawatai?</i>

227
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:43,542
Then "d be obligated
to feed, clothe and protect you.

228
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,042
It's incredibly civilized.

229
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:50,083
<i>- What is it, nanawatai?
- Nanawatai.</i>

230
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,958
<i>- Nanawatai.
- Bread?</i>

231
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:06,750
Smells like he's been chewing on
fucking buffalo shit.

232
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,167
Laszlo...

233
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:16,542
- ... when we get back, transfer out.
- I'll win his respect in time.

234
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,833
When the old man gets on your back,
you can't shake him off.

235
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:27,250
Dear Konstantin, I regard this abuse
as the price I must pay to learn.

236
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:33,333
I love Afghanistan, but we are
a flea in the tail of a bear.

237
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,292
We must join the 20th century.

238
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,333
When Afghans accept that,
I will be there...

239
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,292
...knowing technology and Russian.

240
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,083
- So you're a patriot?
- Yes.

241
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:50,625
So was that rebel. He wanted
to keep things the same.

242
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:55,208
I wish I believed in
something that much. I envy him.

243
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:59,542
- Then why did you crush him?
- I had no choice.

244
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:05,208
- You always have a choice.
- She sent nudes of herself?

245
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:09,375
- Give it to me.
- She's got that nympho look.

246
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:15,125
I got the half I want.

247
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,000
- You son of a bitch.
- Get the fuck off me!

248
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:31,292
- What the hell is going on?
- Nothing, sir.

249
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,083
Thanks, Konstantin.

250
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,417
What is this?

251
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,583
- Brake fluid?!
- No wonder they don't work.

252
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:04,125
Keeps me steady on the gun, sir.
I filter it through bread.

253
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:09,833
I add raisins and sugar. It ferments
in a few days and gives a good kick.

254
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:18,208
- Write him up, sir?
- Get over here.

255
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:24,667
For one mistake?

256
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:28,667
He's the best gunner in the division.
Omit it.

257
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,958
It's already done, sir. In ink.

258
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:16,167
You better watch your ass from now on.

259
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:20,917
Sometimes Afghan snipers
pick off tank drivers.

260
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:25,083
- Sometimes drivers pick them off first.
- Really?

261
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,750
Grenade!

262
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,000
Get down!

263
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:34,000
Shit!

264
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,083
Where are they?

265
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,542
Don't blow it up!

266
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,417
Kill the Russians underneath,
not the tank!

267
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:54,833
Grenade!

268
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:02,458
- Open the hatch!
- "m getting slaughtered!

269
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,167
Open the hatch!

270
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:07,542
I'm bleeding! "m bleeding!

271
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,125
- Inside!
- Get inside.

272
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,625
Get in the tank! Hurry up!

273
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:23,958
Get us the hell out of here!

274
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:25,958
Hurry up!

275
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:31,000
We got a fire on top!

276
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,125
- "m dying! "m dying!
- I can't see.

277
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:35,667
Hard right!

278
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:42,292
Gunner, traverse right, 180!

279
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:46,125
- "m dying!
- Extinguisher!

280
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Traversing!

281
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,833
I can't see through the fire!

282
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:07,667
Gunner, identify! Bead on
the fire of the campsite.

283
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:10,042
I can't get elevation.

284
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,375
We can detect anything
in a 100-metre radius.

285
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:29,083
They must have camels
or something to keep up.

286
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:31,250
They really want this tank.

287
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,042
- They just keep coming.
- Shut up.

288
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:40,125
How much longer are we gonna stay?

289
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:43,333
Till we can see where we're going.

290
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,958
- Crack the hatch, sir?
- No.

291
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:49,000
- Sir, I have to piss.
- Hold it.

292
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:54,542
- Do you have water?
- All the canteens were left behind.

293
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:58,042
- All the rations too.
- Great.

294
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:02,708
- Your pals will feast tonight.
- We don't need food and water.

295
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:04,958
We're safe in here.

296
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:10,958
My tanks have been hit by everything.

297
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:14,333
In Mongolia once...

298
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:18,417
...RPG. Direct hit.

299
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:25,375
Commander, gunner
and turret went flying.

300
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:37,042
I drove the rest of the tank back.

301
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:41,833
These tanks today are better.

302
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:44,750
Much better.

303
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,750
Sir, I can't hold it much longer.

304
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,958
Sir! Sir!

305
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
- How many?
-20 to 25, they're everywhere.

306
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:10,208
- Battle stations.
- I don't think they see us.

307
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:13,125
- They're in RPG range.
- Wait.

308
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,208
- Gunner, troops, frag.
- Frag's up, sir.

309
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:19,833
- Identify.
- I can't identify. It's too dark.

310
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,083
- Go to IR.
- IR is busted!

311
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:27,333
They're all around us, sir.

312
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:32,958
Standby to traverse left, 360.
All weapons fire at my command.

313
00:44:34,042 --> 00:44:35,833
Traverse. Fire!

314
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:52,375
Cease fire!

315
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,375
All dead, sir.

316
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,833
- Samad.
- Sir?

317
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,833
Go verify.

318
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:21,000
- Move it!
- Yes, sir.

319
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,125
Kaminski, stand down.

320
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,958
Koverchenko, get on the co-ax.

321
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:10,583
- Set Samad in your sights.
- What?

322
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,833
Take him now, he's a traitor.

323
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,042
Are you insane?

324
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:23,333
Your insubordination demoted you
from Intelligence to this tank.

325
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:26,042
Your next stop is prison.

326
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:29,958
With your record,
I wouldn't disobey another order.

327
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:33,833
Take Samad now.

328
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,708
No.

329
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,167
How many dead?

330
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:57,000
It's deer, sir.

331
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,458
It's a herd of deer.

332
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:20,833
The Russian kills just to kill.

333
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:39,583
- We're leaking oil.
- Raise the snorkel, seal the cannon.

334
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:45,000
- Are we going underwater, sir?
- The rebels are following our tracks.

335
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:44,875
Samad, stop it.

336
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:50,458
- "m in my prayers, sir.
- Get up.

337
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:03,000
If I can reconcile dialectical
materialism and Allah...

338
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:05,083
...isn't that my business?

339
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:12,000
Why don't you trust me?
You know "m a member of the Party.

340
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:17,625
My son's in Moscow, sir.
You think "d compromise him?

341
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:19,292
I said get up.

342
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:26,958
See how deep the river is.

343
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,917
How, sir?

344
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,458
Walk in it.

345
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:44,333
You don't need that.

346
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:05,750
- Like ice, sir.
- I didn't ask for the temperature.

347
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:10,417
Is the bottom mud or stone?

348
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,917
Stone.

349
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:29,167
Why?

350
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,583
- I said why?!
- Shut up!

351
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,792
What are you doing?

352
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:41,208
- Recording this.
- Add your name.

353
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:46,667
- This'll get you a court-martial.
- So will killing your own men!

354
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:11,667
You would have done the same thing.

355
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:16,792
Samad was waiting for a chance
to give this tank to the enemy.

356
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:21,458
I was too smart for him.

357
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:24,625
And I didn't study philosophy.

358
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,583
I read your dossier, Mr. Intellectual.

359
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:32,375
What do you think it says about you?

360
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:35,042
That I think for myself.

361
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,667
You think for yourself.

362
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:45,667
When I was 8, defending Stalingrad,
I didn't think for myself.

363
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,125
When Russia asked for our lives,
we gave.

364
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:53,958
My father and mother didn't think
of themselves, they gave!

365
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:57,792
My brother didn't think
of himself, he gave!

366
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:03,542
My comrades lowered me
on top of Nazi tanks.

367
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:07,625
I stuffed Molotovs under
turret and cannon...

368
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,292
...then they pulled me up again.

369
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,542
They called me Tank Boy.

370
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:21,333
I took a lot of Nazi tanks.

371
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,875
A lot.

372
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:31,792
Over the years,
"ve learned to smell a traitor.

373
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,417
- How bad is it?
- You mean the tank?

374
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:20,750
Do you think he's snapped, huh?

375
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,375
- What are you doing?
- What?

376
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,500
You want to be next?
Don't talk to him.

377
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,750
- How far can we go?
- Not far enough.

378
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,833
We should ditch this bitch...

379
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:37,208
...dismantle the gun,
walk to Kandahar Road!

380
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:39,917
What are you whispering about?

381
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,667
Kaminski had an interesting idea.

382
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:51,000
Ditching the tank and walking back.

383
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:55,250
He's a fucking liar, sir.

384
00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:00,958
As a man who thinks for himself,
what do you think?

385
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:05,292
Well, sir...

386
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,458
...the roadwhee"s cracked,
he drank our brakes...

387
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,792
...the battery's low,
we're losing oil.

388
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,958
If the engine heats up,
it'll seize.

389
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:17,792
We have no rations.

390
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:22,042
The mujas don't seem to run on
anything we know of...

391
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:24,167
...and they have an RPG.

392
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:28,125
Their aim is getting better.

393
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:33,125
You admire them, don't you?

394
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,417
- They've got us on the run.
- What do you suggest? Surrender?

395
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:48,375
That's a direct violation
of Soviet military law.

396
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:53,833
But you're all for it, aren't you?
That's mutiny.

397
00:54:57,917 --> 00:54:59,208
Try it!

398
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:03,583
- Get his weapon. Cover him.
- Yes, sir.

399
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:07,292
Golikov, get some rope.

400
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:15,375
Now!

401
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,667
Tie him up.

402
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:22,667
I'll haunt you.
I'll be your worst nightmare.

403
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,417
Shut up.

404
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,833
You hear me?

405
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:31,708
- Don't be an idiot.
- I don't believe this.

406
00:55:31,917 --> 00:55:33,417
Hold still, asshole.

407
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,750
- What are we doing?
- Shut up!

408
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,458
- Stepped in this one himself.
- Fucking lackey.

409
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:43,417
Fuck.

410
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:46,667
- Get the logbook.
- Yes, sir.

411
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:53,000
- He doesn't have it. It's in the tank.
- Booby-trap him.

412
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:57,417
- Yes, sir.
- Twisted and insane. Don't be an idiot.

413
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:59,000
Don't move.

414
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:08,667
If you need anything, just nod.

415
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:22,542
- Konstantin, "m sorry.
- Anton.

416
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:25,292
Anton, you're next.

417
00:56:25,542 --> 00:56:29,417
Go blow his brains out,
come back and untie me.

418
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,167
- You're next.
- I can't.

419
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:36,208
You hear me, Anton?
Don't leave me here. Don't leave me.

420
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:38,208
- I can't.
- Untie me!

421
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,833
You're a good soldier.

422
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:45,750
They can depend on you
to shoot your mother.

423
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:48,792
Golikov! Goddamn it!

424
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:55,792
Don't leave me here, you coward!

425
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,583
Golikov, you fuck!

426
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:35,750
- I think you did the right thing.
- I appreciate that, Kaminski.

427
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:39,958
And I think I speak for all of us
when I say that.

428
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:45,708
What he wrote could close doors
for the rest of your lives.

429
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:50,042
I don't know why
you didn't just kill him.

430
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:52,833
I was trying to buy us some time.

431
00:57:58,042 --> 00:57:59,792
Tank's roomier now, sir.

432
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:17,125
Sherina!

433
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:19,958
What are you doing here?

434
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:28,417
Akbar, we would fight
the tank with you.

435
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:31,000
You have no weapons.

436
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:45,125
Get back to the village, woman!... Go!

437
01:00:10,095 --> 01:00:10,761
Uncle...

438
01:00:13,011 --> 01:00:14,886
...am I fit to be Khan?

439
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:21,511
To ask that question makes you Khan.

440
01:00:31,136 --> 01:00:34,720
When The Beast is dead, we will return.

441
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:38,553
I will be waiting.

442
01:01:36,345 --> 01:01:39,761
There it is. Kandahar Road.

443
01:01:49,553 --> 01:01:52,470
Kaminski, we're home!

444
01:01:59,428 --> 01:02:01,803
We're almost out of petrol.

445
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,345
- Make it to the road.
- Yes, sir.

446
01:02:06,678 --> 01:02:08,470
- Stop tank.
- What?

447
01:02:08,803 --> 01:02:11,636
Stop tank. Stop tank!

448
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:23,053
Sir, "m sure I can make it,
it's only-

449
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,553
Please...

450
01:04:14,095 --> 01:04:15,220
Untie my hands.

451
01:04:15,428 --> 01:04:18,845
Afghan women, turn your grief to stone!

452
01:04:22,095 --> 01:04:23,470
Stop!

453
01:04:30,428 --> 01:04:31,928
Jesus. Stop!

454
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,803
Please, stop. Stop!

455
01:04:35,261 --> 01:04:36,345
<i>Nanawatai!</i>

456
01:04:52,345 --> 01:04:54,053
Sherina, how did you find us?

457
01:04:54,386 --> 01:04:55,386
It was Allah's will...

458
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:57,470
We found him tied to the rock.

459
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:01,303
You take the honor, Taj.

460
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:03,470
<i>Nanawatai!</i>

461
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,470
He asks for mercy.

462
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:13,386
<i>I teach you another word - Badal!
Blood for blood!</i>

463
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:15,678
Silence, woman!

464
01:05:18,178 --> 01:05:19,303
You speak Afghan?

465
01:05:22,636 --> 01:05:24,011
What's your name?

466
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:27,845
A crow can speak a word,

467
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,386
but a crow is not a man,
and neither is a Russian.

468
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,803
Kill him!

469
01:05:34,928 --> 01:05:38,928
If we dishonor our code and slay him
we are no better than the infidels.

470
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:52,261
...but why was he abandoned
by the tank?

471
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,053
<i>Nanawatai is for Afghans.</i>

472
01:06:43,678 --> 01:06:46,720
If he is an enemy of our
enemy, then he is a friend.

473
01:06:47,053 --> 01:06:48,886
Let us look to our guest.

474
01:07:22,636 --> 01:07:23,345
Eat.

475
01:07:23,636 --> 01:07:24,803
Choke.

476
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,803
You broke it when you dropped it.

477
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:18,136
So? David took Goliath
with just a stone.

478
01:08:41,886 --> 01:08:43,720
It's an RPG.

479
01:08:50,553 --> 01:08:51,886
It's kaput.

480
01:08:53,136 --> 01:08:55,220
Oh, kaput.

481
01:09:02,886 --> 01:09:04,220
Fix.

482
01:09:06,511 --> 01:09:08,928
I fix, I fix.

483
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:30,845
- Kaput.
- Kaput.

484
01:09:35,011 --> 01:09:36,595
Enfield.

485
01:09:37,553 --> 01:09:38,761
Enfield.

486
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:42,678
I need Enfield to fix the RPG.

487
01:09:50,136 --> 01:09:51,553
Thanks.

488
01:10:19,636 --> 01:10:22,803
Now he has ruined two of our weapons!

489
01:11:09,178 --> 01:11:11,761
This one is truly sent from Allah!

490
01:11:19,386 --> 01:11:20,470
Kaboom.

491
01:11:24,303 --> 01:11:25,345
Exactly.

492
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,345
That's a tank.

493
01:11:41,886 --> 01:11:43,761
- Tank.
- Yeah, tank.

494
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:47,261
RPG...

495
01:11:48,553 --> 01:11:50,011
...kaboom...

496
01:11:50,178 --> 01:11:51,220
...tank.

497
01:11:55,053 --> 01:11:56,845
RPG kaboom tank.

498
01:12:00,845 --> 01:12:02,053
<i>Da...</i>

499
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:04,345
...RPG...

500
01:12:04,845 --> 01:12:06,136
...kaboom...

501
01:12:06,386 --> 01:12:07,761
...tank.

502
01:12:09,845 --> 01:12:11,261
He's Russian!

503
01:12:12,053 --> 01:12:13,595
He knows how to use that...

504
01:12:14,345 --> 01:12:17,011
...and they tried to kill him.

505
01:12:22,011 --> 01:12:24,636
<i>Da kaboom tank.</i>

506
01:13:00,261 --> 01:13:02,220
Yeah, I'll kaboom tank.

507
01:14:05,011 --> 01:14:09,220
Come on, man! Come on, get your shit.
Let's go!

508
01:14:20,553 --> 01:14:22,511
Hey, you guys!

509
01:14:24,345 --> 01:14:26,428
I can't believe it.

510
01:14:27,303 --> 01:14:32,053
- Where did you guys come from?
- Oh, this is beautiful!

511
01:14:32,386 --> 01:14:36,428
- We are so glad to see you guys.
- Oh, my God!

512
01:14:44,053 --> 01:14:49,345
If we hadn't been looking for water,
we'd have never found you guys.

513
01:14:50,095 --> 01:14:53,970
Climb aboard.
I'll call in for a strike on the tank.

514
01:14:55,845 --> 01:14:58,595
Nobody wastes my tank.

515
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:11,303
Get back in the tank.

516
01:15:12,678 --> 01:15:15,803
- What for?
- Because I said so.

517
01:15:18,095 --> 01:15:21,720
- We're going home, sir.
- Yes, in the tank.

518
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:27,636
Why can't we go home
in the fucking helicopter?!

519
01:15:28,678 --> 01:15:30,511
Because you're tankers.

520
01:15:31,636 --> 01:15:34,428
Yeah, you're also in a cul-de-sac.

521
01:15:38,595 --> 01:15:43,678
The only way out is back through
that pass you came through.

522
01:16:13,428 --> 01:16:16,803
We'll go back the same way we got in.

523
01:16:21,053 --> 01:16:22,803
You got any extra water?

524
01:16:22,928 --> 01:16:26,636
No. You two, load the extra fuel
onto the tank.

525
01:16:26,886 --> 01:16:30,178
Radio for more fuel
to meet us at the pass.

526
01:16:31,678 --> 01:16:34,886
Jesus, what an asshole!

527
01:17:09,636 --> 01:17:11,511
What are we doing?

528
01:17:12,553 --> 01:17:16,720
- Why don't we make a run for it?
- Are you fucking crazy?

529
01:17:16,845 --> 01:17:19,511
He'd shoot us right out of the sky.

530
01:18:20,011 --> 01:18:22,345
The tank is leaving!

531
01:18:23,511 --> 01:18:25,761
The pass... The pass!

532
01:18:26,095 --> 01:18:28,886
It's turning back for the pass!

533
01:18:30,428 --> 01:18:31,845
What, what?

534
01:18:32,553 --> 01:18:35,678
- Tank.
- Yeah, I know. What?

535
01:18:36,053 --> 01:18:37,220
Tank.

536
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:41,011
Tank.

537
01:18:50,845 --> 01:18:53,928
It's a dead end, it's a dead end.

538
01:19:08,345 --> 01:19:11,136
The pass. He's going to the pass.

539
01:19:11,345 --> 01:19:15,178
Why the pass?
Why didn't he get in the helicopter?

540
01:19:15,386 --> 01:19:19,303
The bastard won't leave his tank.
He won't leave it.

541
01:19:23,303 --> 01:19:25,636
He's gone. He's gone.

542
01:19:27,845 --> 01:19:29,386
Tank mountains?

543
01:19:34,928 --> 01:19:36,053
Mountains...

544
01:19:40,636 --> 01:19:45,011
He's got to go around
to get to the pass.

545
01:19:51,428 --> 01:19:54,178
A shortcut? You know a shortcut?

546
01:19:54,345 --> 01:19:56,845
- Tank.
- Shortcut. I understand.

547
01:19:57,136 --> 01:19:58,803
I understand.

548
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:04,136
Konstantin.

549
01:20:11,303 --> 01:20:12,886
Konstantin! Khan.

550
01:21:13,345 --> 01:21:18,345
- Sir, the engine's hot.
- Maintain 20 kilometres an hour.

551
01:21:18,511 --> 01:21:21,011
Sir, the radiator needs water.

552
01:21:22,136 --> 01:21:24,053
- Keep going.
- Goddamn it!

553
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,011
The engine's gonna seize up.

554
01:21:27,386 --> 01:21:31,136
Keep going. Waterhole's not far.

555
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,345
You think they radioed back?

556
01:22:33,553 --> 01:22:35,511
Of course they did.

557
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:41,595
I hate this fucking country.

558
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:45,928
Fill the radiator.

559
01:24:19,386 --> 01:24:22,428
Battle stations!

560
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:27,428
Mujahedeen! One thousand metres!

561
01:24:30,553 --> 01:24:32,303
Crank it up.

562
01:24:37,011 --> 01:24:40,678
- Traversing left.
- Come on, baby.

563
01:24:42,678 --> 01:24:44,803
Give me power to the tank!

564
01:24:45,511 --> 01:24:49,345
Shit! I can't, sir, she won't start!

565
01:24:50,095 --> 01:24:52,011
Go to master battery!

566
01:24:53,386 --> 01:24:56,761
Shit! The battery's dead, sir!

567
01:25:16,845 --> 01:25:21,678
- Get us out of here!
- "m trying, sir! It's overheated!

568
01:25:21,928 --> 01:25:24,470
Manual traverse left!

569
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:35,886
Gunner! Frag!

570
01:25:37,261 --> 01:25:39,886
- We're out of frag, sir!
- Anything!

571
01:25:44,845 --> 01:25:46,261
I got heat up!

572
01:25:56,011 --> 01:25:57,970
Goddamn it. Come on!

573
01:26:24,011 --> 01:26:25,428
On the way.

574
01:26:28,928 --> 01:26:31,178
Spread out! Spread out!

575
01:26:31,803 --> 01:26:32,720
Up!

576
01:26:34,886 --> 01:26:36,428
On the way!

577
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:41,220
They're in RPG range, sir!

578
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:52,511
Come on!

579
01:26:55,803 --> 01:26:57,053
I got it, sir!

580
01:27:29,136 --> 01:27:32,136
Tank! Kaput! Now!

581
01:27:34,428 --> 01:27:36,678
Moustafa! Come on!

582
01:27:37,761 --> 01:27:39,428
I have what I want.

583
01:27:40,136 --> 01:27:41,220
The Beast escapes!

584
01:27:41,928 --> 01:27:44,011
Allah has tossed a peach
in our laps - Enjoy it!

585
01:27:44,511 --> 01:27:46,011
Cousin, you are a pig!

586
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:58,553
Hasan, you are clever.

587
01:27:58,928 --> 01:28:01,178
Can you learn a helicopter?

588
01:29:30,095 --> 01:29:31,636
This way.

589
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,511
Shit!

590
01:30:30,136 --> 01:30:32,720
They can't get us! We're too high!

591
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,636
You son of a bitch!

592
01:30:42,803 --> 01:30:45,803
- Can't get elevation, he knows it.
- Who?

593
01:30:46,011 --> 01:30:48,220
<i>- You're mine!
- Badal!</i>

594
01:30:48,428 --> 01:30:52,178
- Keep it coming.
- Last round, sir!

595
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:02,845
- Reload!
- We're out!

596
01:31:14,178 --> 01:31:17,386
- She's burning up!
- Make it to the pass!

597
01:31:35,886 --> 01:31:37,595
Down!

598
01:32:04,095 --> 01:32:05,220
Sir!

599
01:32:05,845 --> 01:32:10,345
Rocket! I need the rocket!

600
01:32:20,845 --> 01:32:23,386
Rocket! Throw!

601
01:32:23,636 --> 01:32:24,970
Throw!

602
01:33:13,511 --> 01:33:17,095
The pass is directly ahead!
One hundred metres!

603
01:33:31,261 --> 01:33:34,511
- Faster, Kaminski!
- Yes, sir!

604
01:34:12,553 --> 01:34:15,386
It only hit the muzzle!

605
01:34:16,178 --> 01:34:18,928
We made it, sir! We made it!

606
01:34:38,928 --> 01:34:42,928
Allah! Why have you forsaken us?

607
01:35:38,553 --> 01:35:42,261
Goliath was covered with armor,
but just a rock brought him down!

608
01:35:45,761 --> 01:35:47,595
<i>Badal!</i>

609
01:36:21,345 --> 01:36:24,845
- We're off the track, sir.
- Oh, God.

610
01:36:46,095 --> 01:36:47,886
Make a run for it, sir?

611
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:52,011
No. The gunships are coming.
We're safe in here.

612
01:36:59,178 --> 01:37:00,678
- Fire!
- Close it!

613
01:37:07,053 --> 01:37:08,720
Tank Boy!

614
01:37:09,428 --> 01:37:14,220
I said, Tank Boy!
I got something for you, Tank Boy!

615
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:15,886
Koverchenko!

616
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:21,261
Kind of hot in there?

617
01:37:21,595 --> 01:37:25,886
- Sir, they got us!
- Oh, shit!

618
01:37:26,136 --> 01:37:30,428
- We gotta go up!
- We're gonna die in here!

619
01:37:33,803 --> 01:37:38,345
- I want you, Tank Boy!
- Oh, shit!

620
01:37:48,511 --> 01:37:50,845
You know our standing orders.

621
01:37:51,636 --> 01:37:53,386
What?

622
01:37:53,595 --> 01:37:58,803
Out of commission, become a pillbox.
Out of ammo, become a bunker.

623
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:01,136
Out of time, become heroes.

624
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:11,011
- You must be out of your fucking mind.
- Now, together.

625
01:38:20,261 --> 01:38:22,011
Get the pin.

626
01:38:26,428 --> 01:38:28,511
We're gonna die in here!

627
01:38:30,428 --> 01:38:35,470
- You son of a bitch!
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

628
01:38:36,511 --> 01:38:39,261
- Son of a bitch, get out!
- Don't shoot.

629
01:38:48,386 --> 01:38:50,095
Shit!

630
01:39:12,886 --> 01:39:14,636
Allah is too generous!

631
01:39:15,761 --> 01:39:18,428
I didn't want to leave you out there.

632
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:23,470
- Take Daskal and let us go.
- Please don't let them kill me.

633
01:39:23,970 --> 01:39:25,386
Get up.

634
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:28,386
Such unmanliness makes revenge unclean.

635
01:39:32,928 --> 01:39:35,136
<i>Nanawatai shuravi.</i>

636
01:39:39,428 --> 01:39:41,761
He will always be Russian.

637
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:44,511
Move aside and I will kill them all!

638
01:39:50,553 --> 01:39:53,928
Tank kaput. Tank kaput.

639
01:39:54,636 --> 01:39:56,845
<i>Nanawatai shuravi.</i>

640
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:08,553
Are you an angel or a devil?

641
01:40:34,511 --> 01:40:39,220
Okay, take the boots.
Okay, take the helmet.

642
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:42,928
Okay, take the boots, take the boots.

643
01:40:46,011 --> 01:40:47,428
Sorry, sir.

644
01:40:48,595 --> 01:40:50,553
Not much of a war.

645
01:40:51,386 --> 01:40:53,345
No Stalingrad.

646
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,720
How is it that
we're the Nazis this time?

647
01:41:00,595 --> 01:41:02,345
How is that?

648
01:41:04,428 --> 01:41:06,845
I'm trying to be a good soldier.

649
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:12,053
But you can't be a good soldier
in a rotten war, sir.

650
01:41:13,803 --> 01:41:17,095
I want you to live to see them win.

651
01:41:18,386 --> 01:41:19,636
Go.

652
01:41:20,595 --> 01:41:23,011
I said, go!

653
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:29,470
<i>Badal!</i>

654
01:42:57,303 --> 01:42:58,595
Afghanistan.

655
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:31,220
I don't understand you.

656
01:43:39,553 --> 01:43:41,303
Konstantin.

657
01:43:55,261 --> 01:43:57,053
Forgive me, my Khan...

658
01:44:01,053 --> 01:44:02,720
Two escaped.
