1
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,300
Sméagol!

2
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,600
I've got one!

3
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,100
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,900
Déagol!

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,700
Déagol?

7
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,300
Déagol.

8
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,500
Why?

10
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,700
Because...

11
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,500
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,700
My precious.

13
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,700
They cursed us.

14
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,200
Murderer.

15
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,700
"Murderer" they called us.

16
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,500
They cursed us
and drove us away.

17
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Gollum.

18
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Gollum.

19
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,100
Gollum.

20
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,300
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,900
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,100
--And cool
So nice for feet

23
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,200
And we only wish
To catch a fish

24
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,500
So juicy sweet

25
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,600
...the sound of trees...

27
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
...the softness of the wind.

28
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,600
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,500
My precious.

30
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,100
Wake up!

31
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,700
Wake up!

32
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,600
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
We must go, yes.

34
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,300
We must go at once.

35
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,700
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,200
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,800
No.

39
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
It isn't.

40
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,900
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,500
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,700
Come on!

43
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,200
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,700
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,600
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
Here.

47
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,100
What about you?

48
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,500
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,300
Sam.

50
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,300
All right.

51
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,900
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,800
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,700
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,200
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,300
There should be enough.

56
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,500
For what?

57
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,800
The journey home.

58
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,500
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,700
Very close now.

60
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,900
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,700
No safe places here.

62
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,900
Hurry.

63
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
It's good.

64
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,300
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,800
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

67
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,900
-Green Dragon.
-A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,500
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,400
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

70
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,600
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,900
...to Isengard!

72
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,900
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,800
...and now we find you feasting
and...and smoking!

74
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,500
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,300
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,100
Salted pork?

78
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,500
-Hobbits.
-We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,400
...who's taken over management
of Isengard.

80
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,700
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,300
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,700
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

83
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,300
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,400
...locked in his tower.

85
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,300
Show yourself.

86
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,100
Be careful.

87
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,500
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,700
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

89
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
No.

90
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,300
We need him alive.

91
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,800
We need him to talk.

92
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,600
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

93
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
...and made peace afterwards.

94
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,100
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,400
Can we not have peace, you and I?

96
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,400
We shall have peace.

97
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,300
We shall have peace...

98
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,300
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,100
...and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,800
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,500
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

103
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,400
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,400
...we shall have peace.

105
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,700
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
Dotard!

107
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,300
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,700
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,600
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

110
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,600
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,600
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

112
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,100
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,500
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,900
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,200
So you have come here for information.

116
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,800
I have some for you.

117
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,900
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,900
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,400
His attack will come soon.

122
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
You're all going to die.

123
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,100
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,700
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,700
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

126
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,500
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,500
...those he professes to love.

128
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,800
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,900
...before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,700
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

131
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,100
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,100
No.

134
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,700
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,700
-...and your life will be spared.
-Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,100
I have no use for it!

137
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,300
Saruman...

138
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
...your staff is broken.

139
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,100
Grima, you need not follow him.

140
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,800
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,700
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,100
Come down.

143
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,900
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,500
...but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,300
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

147
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,900
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,900
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,800
Grima...

150
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,400
...come down.

151
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,100
Be free of him.

152
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,100
-Free? He will never be free.
-No.

153
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,000
Get down, cur!

154
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,900
Saruman!

155
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,600
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Tell us what you know!

157
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,600
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

158
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,200
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,700
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,600
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

161
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,100
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

162
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,300
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,200
...is washing away.

164
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,700
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,300
Young trees.

166
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,500
-Wild trees.
-Pippin!

167
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,700
Bless my bark!

168
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,700
Peregrin Took!

169
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,300
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,300
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,800
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

172
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,900
Hail!

174
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,300
No pauses.

175
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,400
-No spills.
-And no regurgitation.

176
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,500
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,600
Last one standing wins.

178
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,700
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

179
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,200
To victory!

180
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,900
I am happy for you.

181
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,600
He is an honourable man.

182
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
You are both honourable men.

183
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,300
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

184
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,900
Don't listen to me.

185
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,100
You are young.

186
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,500
And tonight is for you.

187
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,900
Here, here.

188
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:24,000
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

189
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,300
I feel something.

190
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,800
A slight tingle in my fingers.

191
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,000
I think it's affecting me.

192
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,500
What did I say?

193
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,800
He can't hold his liquor.

194
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,100
Game over.

195
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,600
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

196
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,500
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

197
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,900
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

198
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,800
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon

199
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But the only brew for the brave and true

200
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,800
Pippin!

201
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,100
But the only brew for the brave and true

202
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,100
Comes from The Green Dragon

203
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,400
Thank you! I win!

204
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,500
No news of Frodo?

205
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,000
No word. Nothing.

206
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,900
We have time.

207
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,500
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

208
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Do we know that?

209
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,500
What does your heart tell you?

210
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,500
That Frodo is alive.

211
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,300
Yes.

212
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Yes, he's alive.

213
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,700
Too risky. Too risky.

214
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,100
Thieves.

215
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
They stole it from us.

216
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,700
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

217
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,400
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

218
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,000
Mustn't ruin it now.

219
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,100
But they knows.

220
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,100
They knows.

221
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,800
They suspects us.

222
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,300
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

223
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,900
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

224
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,900
No. Not.

225
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,100
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

226
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,900
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

227
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,500
And we will.

228
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,500
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

229
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,300
It's ours!

230
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,000
Ours!

231
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,900
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

232
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,300
Patience! Patience, my love.

233
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,700
First we must lead them to her.

234
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,300
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

235
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,000
Yes, the stairs. And then?

236
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,100
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

237
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,400
...until we come to the tunnel.

238
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,700
And when they go in...

239
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,600
...there's no coming out.

240
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,200
She's always hungry.

241
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
She always needs to feed.

242
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,500
She must eat.

243
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,700
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

244
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,500
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

245
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,700
No.

246
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,300
Not very nice at all, my love.

247
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,200
She hungers for sweeter meats.

248
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,100
Hobbit meat.

249
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,900
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

250
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,000
...then we will find it.

251
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,300
And take it for me!

252
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,400
For us.

253
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,700
Yes. We meant "for us."

254
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,200
Gollum. Gollum.

255
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,700
The precious will be ours...

256
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,200
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

257
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,100
You treacherous little toad!

258
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,900
No! No! Master!

259
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,600
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

260
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,000
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

261
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,100
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

262
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,100
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

263
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,700
...who hates Sméagol...

264
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,600
...and who makes up nasty lies.

265
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,300
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

266
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,900
Sam!

267
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,500
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

268
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,100
-You scare him off, we're lost!
-I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

269
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,300
-I won't wait around for him to kill us!
-I'm not sending him away.

270
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,900
You don't see it, do you?

271
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,700
He's a villain.

272
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,100
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

273
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,700
I need you on my side.

274
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,700
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

275
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,000
I know, Sam. I know.

276
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,400
Trust me.

277
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,900
Come, Sméagol.

278
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,400
What time is it?

279
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,100
Not yet dawn.

280
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,700
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

281
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,700
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

282
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,200
I stood upon the brink.

283
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,100
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

284
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,700
A light shone behind me...

285
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,600
...but I could not turn.

286
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,000
I could only stand there, waiting.

287
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,000
Night changes many thoughts.

288
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,500
Sleep, Éowyn.

289
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,100
Sleep...

290
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,500
...while you can.

291
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,900
The stars are veiled.

292
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,200
Something stirs in the east.

293
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,900
A sleepless malice.

294
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,500
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

295
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,900
What are you doing?

296
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,800
Pippin!

297
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,700
Pippin?

298
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,300
Pippin.

299
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,500
-What, are you mad?
-I just want to look at it.

300
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
Just one more time.

301
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Put it back.

302
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,500
Pippin.

303
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
No!

304
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,300
Pippin.

305
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,700
He is here.

306
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,000
I see you.

307
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,500
Pippin!

308
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,100
Help! Gandalf, help!

309
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,600
Someone help him!

310
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,900
Pippin!

311
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,200
Fool of a Took!

312
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,500
Look at me.

313
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Gandalf, forgive me.

314
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,300
Look at me.

315
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,300
What did you see?

316
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
A tree.

317
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,300
There was a white tree...

318
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,900
...in a courtyard of stone.

319
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,900
It was dead.

320
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,600
The city was burning.

321
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,000
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

322
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,600
I saw....

323
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,200
I saw him.

324
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,200
I could hear his voice in my head.

325
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,700
And what did you tell him?

326
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,600
Speak!

327
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,700
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

328
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,200
He hurt me.

329
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,700
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

330
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,500
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

331
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,400
A fool...

332
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,800
...but an honest fool he remains.

333
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,600
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

334
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,900
We've been strangely fortunate.

335
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,800
Pippin saw in the palantir
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

336
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,500
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

337
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,600
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

338
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,000
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

339
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

340
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,000
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

341
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,000
Sauron fears this.

342
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,300
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

343
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,800
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

344
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,300
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

345
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,200
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

346
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,200
Tell me...

347
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,000
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

348
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,500
What do we owe Gondor?

349
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,500
-I will go.
-No!

350
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,700
-They must be warned.
-They will be.

351
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,500
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

352
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,300
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

353
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,100
Understand this:

354
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,700
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

355
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
I ride for Minas Tirith...

356
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,900
...and I won't be going alone.

357
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,100
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

358
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,700
Hurry! Hurry!

359
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
Where are we going?

360
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
Why did you look?

361
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,600
Why do you always have to look?

362
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,700
-I don't know. I can't help it.
-You never can.

363
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,500
I'm sorry, all right?

364
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,300
-I won't do it again.
-Don't you understand?

365
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,900
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

366
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,700
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

367
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,600
And you--? You're coming with me?

368
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,100
Merry?

369
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,500
Come on.

370
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,100
How far is Minas Tirith?

371
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,800
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

372
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,300
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

373
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,400
Here.

374
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,300
Something for the road.

375
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,000
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

376
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,000
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

377
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,600
But-- But we'll see each other soon.

378
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,200
-Won't we?
-I don't know.

379
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,100
I don't know what's going to happen.

380
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,900
-Merry.
-Run, Shadowfax.

381
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,400
Show us the meaning of haste.

382
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,400
Merry!

383
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Merry!

384
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,000
He's always followed me...

385
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,600
...everywhere I went...

386
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,700
...since before we were tweens.

387
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,500
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

388
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
...but I was always there to get him out.

389
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,900
Now he's gone.

390
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,300
Just like Frodo and Sam.

391
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,500
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

392
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,300
They're a most hardy folk.

393
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,300
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

394
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,400
Take her by the safest road.

395
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,000
A ship lies anchored
In the Grey Havens.

396
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,900
It waits to carry her across the sea.

397
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,300
The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.

398
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,100
There is nothing for you here...

399
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,700
...only death.

400
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,000
Lady Arwen...

401
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,700
...we cannot delay.

402
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,300
My lady!

403
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,400
-Tell me what you have seen.
-Arwen.

404
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,400
You have the gift of foresight.

405
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,300
What did you see?

406
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,100
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

407
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,700
But there is also life.

408
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,400
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

409
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,400
That future is almost gone.

410
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,500
But it is not lost.

411
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,100
Nothing is certain.

412
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,300
Some things are certain.

413
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,700
If I leave him now...

414
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,400
... I will regret it forever.

415
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,700
It is time.

416
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,300
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

417
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,800
A light from the shadow shall spring

418
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,100
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

419
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,300
The crownless again shall be king

420
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,800
Re-forge the sword.

421
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,900
Your hands are cold.

422
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,100
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

423
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,200
This was my choice.

424
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,200
Whether by your will or not...

425
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,600
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

426
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,600
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

427
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,900
Minas Tirith.

428
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,700
City of kings.

429
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,500
Make way!

430
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,300
It's the tree.

431
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,000
Gandalf. Gandalf.

432
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,300
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

433
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,300
The tree of the king.

434
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,000
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

435
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,700
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

436
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,800
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

437
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,000
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

438
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,700
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

439
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,200
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

440
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,700
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

441
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,900
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

442
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,700
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

443
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,800
Perhaps you come to explain this.

444
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,600
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

445
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,300
Boromir died to save us...

446
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,100
...my kinsman and me.

447
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,600
-He fell defending us from many foes.
-Pippin.

448
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,200
I offer you my service, such as it is...

449
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,700
...in payment of this debt.

450
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,900
This is my first command to you.

451
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,900
How did you escape
and my son did not...

452
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,500
...so mighty a man as he was?

453
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,300
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

454
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,400
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

455
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,000
Get up.

456
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,600
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

457
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,700
...but it is not now.

458
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,500
War is coming.

459
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,100
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

460
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,300
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

461
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,100
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

462
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,600
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

463
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,500
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

464
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,600
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

465
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

466
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,700
I have seen more than you know.

467
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,000
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

468
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,900
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

469
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,600
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

470
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,500
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

471
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,300
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

472
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,800
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

473
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,500
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

474
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,900
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

475
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,600
Come.

476
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,700
All has turned to vain ambition.

477
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,200
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

478
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,600
A thousand years
this city has stood.

479
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,000
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

480
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,300
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

481
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,900
...will never bloom again.

482
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,300
-Why are they still guarding it?
-They guard it because they have hope.

483
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,500
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

484
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,200
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

485
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,200
...before it fell into decay.

486
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,500
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

487
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,700
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

488
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,800
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

489
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,600
...dearer than the names of their sons.

490
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,600
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

491
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,900
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

492
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,700
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

493
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,900
The line of kings failed.

494
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,800
The White Tree withered.

495
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,500
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

496
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,000
Mordor.

497
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,000
Yes, there it lies.

498
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,000
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

499
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,500
A storm is coming.

500
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,900
This is not the weather of the world.

501
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,200
This is a device of Sauron's making.

502
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,000
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

503
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,900
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

504
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,800
...so he covers the face of the sun...

505
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,600
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

506
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,900
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

507
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,200
...it will begin.

508
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,300
Well...

509
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,000
... Minas Tirith...

510
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,200
...very impressive.

511
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,900
-So where are we off to next?
-Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

512
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,100
There's no leaving this city.

513
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,500
Help must come to us.

514
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,500
It must be getting near teatime.

515
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,200
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

516
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,800
We're not in decent places.

517
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,300
Mr. Frodo?

518
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,400
What is it?

519
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,000
It's just a feeling.

520
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
I don't think I'll be coming back.

521
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,200
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

522
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,600
That's just morbid thinking.

523
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,400
We're going there and back again...

524
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,700
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

525
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,700
You'll see.

526
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,000
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

527
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,100
Long ago, when there was a king.

528
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,600
Mr. Frodo, look.

529
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,800
The king has got a crown again.

530
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,600
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

531
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,600
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

532
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,900
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

533
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,800
-Do they?
-You're in the service of the steward now.

534
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,200
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

535
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,500
Ridiculous Hobbit.

536
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,700
Guard of the Citadel.

537
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,600
Thank you.

538
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,700
There's no more stars.

539
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,400
Is it time?

540
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,200
Yes.

541
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,300
It's so quiet.

542
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:20,300
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

543
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,200
I don't want to be in a battle...

544
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,800
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

545
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,700
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

546
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,900
There never was much hope.

547
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,500
Just a fool's hope.

548
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,800
Our enemy is ready.

549
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,600
His full strength's gathered.

550
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,100
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

551
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,100
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

552
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,900
...mercenaries from the coast.

553
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,500
All will answer Mordor's call.

554
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,200
Come on.

555
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,500
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

556
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,900
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

557
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,900
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

558
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,600
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

559
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,700
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

560
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,800
Gandalf?

561
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,900
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

562
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,000
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies In war.

563
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,100
The one they say no living man can kill.

564
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,200
The Witch King of Angmar.

565
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,500
You've met him before.

566
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,600
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

567
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,500
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

568
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,300
...the greatest of the Nine.

569
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,900
Minas Morgul is his lair.

570
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,700
The Dead City.

571
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,800
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

572
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,800
Quick. Quick.

573
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,800
They will see. They will see.

574
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:56,800
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

575
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,700
The way into Mordor.

576
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,000
The secret stair.

577
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,700
Climb.

578
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,700
-No, Mr. Frodo!
-Not that way!

579
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,100
-What's it doing?
-No.

580
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,300
-They're calling me.
-No.

581
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,500
Hide! Hide!

582
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,000
I can feel his blade.

583
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,300
We come to it at last.

584
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,800
The great battle of our time.

585
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,500
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

586
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,800
The board is set.

587
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,400
The pieces are moving.

588
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,400
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

589
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,200
And then it's into the tunnel.

590
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,400
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

591
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,500
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

592
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,500
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

593
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,200
One sniff something's not right...

594
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,400
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

595
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,200
No more slinker. No more stinker.

596
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,000
You're gone. Got it?

597
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,700
I'm watching you.

598
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,800
What was that about?

599
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,300
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

600
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,400
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

601
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:02,900
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

602
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,100
You must not fail me.

603
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,900
It's been very quiet across the river.

604
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,300
The Orcs are lying low.

605
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,400
The garrison may have moved out.

606
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,100
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

607
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,400
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

608
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,800
Quiet.

609
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,600
We need 10 more.

610
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,500
Kill him!

611
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,500
They're not coming from the north.

612
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,000
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Come on.

613
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,800
Faster.

614
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,700
Draw swords.

615
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,500
Hold! Hold them!

616
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,300
What?

617
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,700
Amon Dîn.

618
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,200
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

619
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,300
Hope is kindled.

620
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,100
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

621
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,900
Gondor calls for aid.

622
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,700
And Rohan will answer.

623
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,800
Muster the Rohirrim.

624
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,200
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

625
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,500
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

626
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:33,800
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

627
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,000
-Forward.
-Very good, sir.

628
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,400
-Gamling.
-My lord.

629
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,100
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

630
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,300
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

631
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,000
I will.

632
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,900
-Will you ride with us?
-Just to the encampment.

633
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,900
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

634
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,000
The men have found their captain.

635
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,300
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

636
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,000
You have given us hope.

637
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,000
Excuse me.

638
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,700
I have a sword.

639
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,300
Please accept it.

640
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:21,700
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

641
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And gladly I accept it.

642
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,900
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

643
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,800
Horse-Men.

644
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,800
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

645
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,000
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

646
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,500
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

647
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,500
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

648
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,400
...the doom of our time will be decided.

649
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:23,200
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

650
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,700
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

651
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,900
Faramir!

652
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,500
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

653
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,100
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

654
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,600
Nazgûl.

655
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,300
Take cover!

656
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,900
Nazgûl!

657
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,500
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

658
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,700
Fall back!

659
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,800
-Retreat! Retreat!
-Run for your lives!

660
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:31,200
The age of Men is over.

661
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:36,800
The time of the Orc has come.

662
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,300
-Keep going.
-It's the Nazgûl.

663
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,100
Take cover, my lord!

664
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,700
It's coming!

665
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,300
-It's Mithrandir.
-The White Rider!

666
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,900
Pull!

667
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,200
Mithrandir.

668
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,100
They broke through our defenses.

669
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,300
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

670
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,400
-Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
-It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

671
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,900
-Long has he foreseen this doom.
-Foreseen and done nothing.

672
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,500
Faramir?

673
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:19,000
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

674
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,300
No.

675
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,000
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

676
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:28,100
-Where? When?
-In lthilien.

677
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,300
Not two days ago.

678
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,000
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

679
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,200
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

680
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,600
What does that mean?

681
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,500
-What's wrong?
-Faramir, tell me everything.

682
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,600
Tell me all you know.

683
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,000
This is how you would serve your city?

684
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,300
You would risk its utter ruin?

685
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,900
I did what I judged to be right.

686
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,400
What you judged to be right.

687
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,700
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

688
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:18,100
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

689
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,100
Hidden.

690
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,200
Dark and deep in the vaults...

691
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,400
...not to be used.

692
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:35,100
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

693
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,500
I would not use the Ring.

694
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,600
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

695
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,600
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

696
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,900
...as a king of old.

697
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,200
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

698
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,000
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

699
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,600
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

700
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

701
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,300
-You know nothing of this matter!
-He would have kept it for his own.

702
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,200
And when he returned...

703
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,900
...you would not have known your son.

704
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,500
Boromir was loyal to me!

705
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,100
Not some wizard's pupil!

706
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,200
Father?

707
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,200
My son.

708
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,700
Leave me.

709
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,300
Careful, master. Careful.

710
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,500
Very far to fall.

711
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:49,600
Very dangerous are the stairs.

712
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,600
Come, master.

713
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,200
Come to Sméagol.

714
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,700
Mr. Frodo.

715
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,200
Get back, you!

716
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,500
Don't touch him!

717
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,100
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

718
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,900
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

719
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,300
Master?

720
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,400
Master carries heavy burden.

721
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,700
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

722
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,000
Fat one cannot know.

723
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,600
Sméagol look after master.

724
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,900
He wants it.

725
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:53,400
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

726
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,800
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

727
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,700
The fat one will take it from you.

728
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,800
Send forth all legions.

729
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,800
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

730
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,500
Slay them all.

731
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:28,700
-What of the wizard?
-I will break him.

732
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,200
Where are Théoden's riders?

733
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,800
Will Rohan's army come?

734
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,100
Mithrandir.

735
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,900
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

736
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,100
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

737
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:58,500
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

738
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,100
It was well done.

739
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,100
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

740
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,200
You are to join the tower guard.

741
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,600
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

742
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,100
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

743
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,800
A very foolish one...

744
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,000
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

745
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,800
-This was yours?
-Yes, it was mine.

746
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,700
My father had it made for me.

747
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,000
Well...

748
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,100
... I'm taller than you were then.

749
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:34,400
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

750
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:39,200
Never fitted me either.

751
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,100
Boromir was always the soldier.

752
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,300
They were so alike, he and my father.

753
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,900
Proud.

754
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,200
Stubborn even.

755
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,300
But strong.

756
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,800
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

757
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,700
And one day your father will see it.

758
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,400
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

759
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,000
...in peace or war...

760
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,900
...in living or dying...

761
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,500
...from....

762
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,700
From this hour henceforth...

763
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,700
...until my lord release me...

764
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,300
...or death take me.

765
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,200
And I shall not forget it...

766
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:34,600
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

767
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,100
Fealty with love.

768
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,700
Valour with honour.

769
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,500
Disloyalty with vengeance.

770
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,700
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

771
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,500
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

772
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,000
-What would you have me do?
-I will not yield...

773
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,900
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

774
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,600
Osgiliath must be retaken.

775
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,700
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

776
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,100
Much must be risked in war.

777
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,400
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

778
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,500
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

779
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,100
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

780
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,100
Yes.

781
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:45,800
I wish that.

782
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,300
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

783
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,800
... I will do what I can
in his stead.

784
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:12,900
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

785
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,400
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

786
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,500
What are you up to?

787
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,900
Sneaking off, are we?

788
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,300
Sneaking?

789
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,400
Sneaking?

790
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,800
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

791
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,800
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

792
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,100
...and they say "sneak."

793
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,100
Sneak?

794
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,300
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

795
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,000
-Very nice, very nice.
-All right. All right!

796
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,300
You just startled me is all.

797
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,600
What were you doing?

798
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
Sneaking.

799
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,500
Fine. Have it your own way.

800
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,100
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

801
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,300
We have to be moving on.

802
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,800
It's dark still.

803
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,100
It's always dark here.

804
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,000
It's gone!

805
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,900
-The Elven bread.
-What?

806
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:47,500
That's all we have left.

807
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,800
He took it. He must have!

808
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,400
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

809
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,300
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

810
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,500
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

811
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,200
He doesn't eat it.

812
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,400
-He can't have taken it.
-Look.

813
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,100
What's this?

814
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:16,900
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

815
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,200
He took it.

816
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

817
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,900
That's a filthy lie!

818
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,200
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

819
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:29,500
-Sam!
-Call me--

820
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:30,900
Stop it!

821
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:33,000
Sam!

822
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,700
-I'll kill him!
-Sam! No!

823
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:44,100
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so-- So angry.

824
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,300
Here, just--
Let's just rest a bit.

825
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,400
-I'm all right.
-No.

826
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,500
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

827
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,700
It's that Gollum.

828
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,500
It's this place.

829
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:58,200
It's that thing around your neck.

830
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,800
I could help a bit.

831
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,500
I could carry it for a while.

832
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:07,300
Carry it for a while.

833
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,700
I could carry it... I could carry it.

834
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:14,500
Share the load...Share the load...
the load...the load.

835
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:15,900
Get away!

836
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,500
I don't want to keep it.

837
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,900
I just want to help.

838
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,400
See? See?

839
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,800
He wants it for himself.

840
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,600
Shut up, you!

841
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,900
Go away!
Get out of here!

842
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:36,800
No, Sam.

843
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,200
It's you.

844
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,900
I'm sorry, Sam.

845
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,800
But he's a liar.

846
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,500
He's poisoned you against me.

847
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,700
You can't help me anymore.

848
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,400
You don't mean that.

849
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,500
Go home.

850
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,000
Faramir!

851
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,000
Faramir!

852
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,400
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

853
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,500
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

854
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,400
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

855
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,800
This is the city of the Men of Nûmenor.

856
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,100
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

857
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:40,300
...her memory, her wisdom.

858
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,900
Your father loves you, Faramir.

859
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,500
He will remember it
before the end.

860
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,700
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

861
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:01,900
Well...

862
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,000
...yes.

863
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:08,300
At least, well enough
for my own people.

864
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,100
But we have no songs
for great halls...

865
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,300
...and evil times.

866
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,200
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

867
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,200
Come, sing me a song.

868
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,000
Home is behind

869
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,800
The world ahead

870
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:47,700
And there are many paths to tread

871
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,800
Through shadow

872
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
To the edge of night

873
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:03,500
Until the stars are all alight

874
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:10,500
Mist and shadow

875
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:14,800
Cloud and shade

876
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,300
All shall fade

877
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,400
All shall

878
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:34,200
Fade

879
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,900
March! March!

880
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:06,100
March! March! March!

881
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,600
Make way for the king.

882
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,000
Make way.

883
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,300
The king is here.

884
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,700
My lord.

885
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,800
Hail to you, sire.

886
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:27,400
Grimbold, how many?

887
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,900
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

888
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,400
We have 300 more from Fenmarch,
Théoden King.

889
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,300
-Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
-None have come, my lord.

890
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,700
Six thousand spears.

891
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,600
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

892
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:03,100
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

893
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,500
More will come.

894
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,700
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

895
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,300
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

896
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,200
The horses are restless...

897
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,800
...and the men are quiet.

898
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,300
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

899
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,400
That road there...

900
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:46,300
...where does that lead?

901
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,700
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

902
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,300
None who venture there ever return.

903
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,200
That mountain is evil.

904
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,000
Aragorn.

905
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,500
Let's find some food.

906
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,700
There.

907
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,500
A true esquire of Rohan.

908
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,900
I'm ready.

909
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,700
Sorry.

910
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,000
It isn't all that dangerous.

911
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,700
It's not even sharp.

912
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,600
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

913
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,200
Come on.

914
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,100
To the smithy. Go!

915
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,000
You should not encourage him.

916
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,500
You should not doubt him.

917
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:19,800
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

918
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,900
Why should Merry be left behind?

919
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:26,600
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

920
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,700
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

921
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,700
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

922
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,900
When the fear takes him...

923
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:45,900
...and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

924
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:48,400
...do you think he would stand and fight?

925
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,400
He would flee.

926
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,500
And he would be right to do so.

927
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:00,400
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

928
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,200
I choose a mortal life.

929
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,700
I wish I could've seen him...

930
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,400
...one last time.

931
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,500
Sir?

932
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:03,700
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

933
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:25,500
I take my leave.

934
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,800
My lord Elrond.

935
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:44,700
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

936
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,600
Arwen is dying.

937
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:58,100
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

938
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,000
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

939
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:06,000
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

940
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:09,800
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

941
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,000
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

942
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:14,900
The end has come.

943
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:17,800
It will not be our end, but his.

944
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,000
You ride to war, but not to victory.

945
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,500
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

946
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,900
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

947
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:34,600
A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.

948
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,200
They'll be in the city in two days.

949
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:40,400
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

950
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,100
You need more men.

951
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,100
There are none.

952
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,600
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

953
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:01,300
Murderers...

954
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:02,800
...traitors.

955
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,300
You would call upon them to fight?

956
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,900
They believe in nothing.

957
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:11,100
They answer to no one.

958
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,300
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

959
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:26,000
Andûril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

960
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:44,000
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

961
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:02,000
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

962
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,500
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

963
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:08,400
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

964
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,200
Put aside the Ranger.

965
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,600
Become who you were born to be.

966
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,700
Take the Dimholt road.

967
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:24,200
I give hope to Men.

968
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:31,300
I keep none for myself.

969
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,200
Why are you doing this?

970
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:47,700
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

971
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:52,100
You cannot abandon the men.

972
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:54,800
Éowyn....

973
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,100
We need you here.

974
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,000
Why have you come?

975
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,500
Do you not know?

976
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,300
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

977
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,300
I cannot give you what you seek.

978
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:38,100
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

979
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,600
Just where do you think
you're off to?

980
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,100
Not this time.

981
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:02,300
This time you must stay, Gimli.

982
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,700
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

983
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:11,300
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

984
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,800
-What's happening?
-Where is he going?

985
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,900
Where's he going?

986
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,400
I don't understand.

987
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,300
Lord Aragorn!

988
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,300
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

989
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,500
He leaves because there is no hope.

990
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,200
He leaves because he must.

991
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,000
Too few have come.

992
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,200
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

993
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,200
No...

994
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:05,800
...we cannot.

995
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:12,200
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

996
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:27,700
I have left instruction.

997
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:33,400
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

998
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,900
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

999
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:45,800
Long may you defend Edoras...

1000
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,200
...if the battle goes ill.

1001
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:52,500
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1002
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:56,500
Duty?

1003
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,900
No.

1004
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:09,900
I would have you smile again...

1005
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:18,000
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1006
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:26,000
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1007
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,800
...and no more despair.

1008
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:42,300
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1009
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:44,200
One that is cursed.

1010
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:48,500
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

1011
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,600
...to the last king of Gondor...

1012
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,700
...to come to his aid...

1013
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,500
...to fight.

1014
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
But when the time came...

1015
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,100
...when Gondor's need was dire...

1016
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,100
...they fled...

1017
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:06,500
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1018
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,700
And so Isildur cursed them...

1019
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:14,900
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1020
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:22,100
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

1021
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,700
The forgotten people.

1022
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:27,300
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1023
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:29,500
From the north shall he come.

1024
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,600
Need shall drive him.

1025
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:36,000
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

1026
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:56,900
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1027
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,100
The way is shut.

1028
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,700
It was made by those
who are dead.

1029
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:09,400
And the Dead keep it.

1030
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,400
The way is shut.

1031
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:23,700
Brego!

1032
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,700
I do not fear death.

1033
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,800
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1034
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,500
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1035
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,900
Oh.

1036
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:52,800
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1037
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,300
We must ride light and swift.

1038
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,200
It is a long road ahead.

1039
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:14,300
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1040
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:22,500
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

1041
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,700
All my friends have gone to battle.

1042
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:26,700
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1043
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,900
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1044
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,300
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1045
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,300
I want to fight.

1046
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,700
I will say no more.

1047
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,700
Ride with me.

1048
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,500
My lady.

1049
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,900
Form up! Move out!

1050
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:03,100
Form up! Move out!

1051
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:07,300
Ride!

1052
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,300
Ride now to Gondor!

1053
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,900
What is it?

1054
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,500
What do you see?

1055
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,800
I see shapes of men.

1056
01:46:58,400 --> 01:46:59,700
And of horses.

1057
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,500
Where?

1058
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:04,500
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1059
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:09,000
Spears rise...

1060
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,900
...like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1061
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:16,200
The Dead are following.

1062
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,800
They have been summoned.

1063
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,200
The Dead?

1064
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,200
Summoned?

1065
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,400
I knew that.

1066
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,300
Very good.

1067
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,900
Very good! Legolas!

1068
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,700
Do not look down.

1069
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:06,100
Who enters my domain?

1070
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:11,800
One who will have your allegiance.

1071
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:19,800
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1072
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:22,600
You will suffer me.

1073
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:48,400
The way is shut.

1074
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:53,800
It was made by those who are dead.

1075
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:58,200
And the Dead keep it.

1076
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,900
The way is shut.

1077
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:14,100
Now you must die.

1078
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:20,500
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1079
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:25,600
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

1080
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,100
That line was broken.

1081
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,700
It has been remade.

1082
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:46,800
Fight for us...

1083
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,400
...and regain your honour.

1084
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:54,700
What say you?

1085
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,900
What say you?

1086
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:10,300
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1087
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:13,500
They had no honour in life,
they have none now in death.

1088
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,400
I am Isildur's heir.

1089
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:18,800
Fight for me...

1090
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,800
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1091
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,400
What say you?

1092
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,100
You have my word!

1093
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:42,300
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1094
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:45,100
What say you?!

1095
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:51,100
Stand, you traitors!

1096
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:17,900
Out!

1097
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,900
Legolas!

1098
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,200
Run!

1099
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:47,800
We fight.

1100
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:00,200
Open the gate! Quick!

1101
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,900
Quick! Hurry!

1102
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:46,600
Faramir!

1103
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:50,700
Say not that he has fallen.

1104
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,300
They were outnumbered.

1105
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:55,200
None survived.

1106
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:57,800
Fear.

1107
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,400
The city is rank with it.

1108
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:06,000
Let us ease their pain.

1109
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:07,900
Release the prisoners.

1110
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:10,000
Catapults!

1111
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:26,100
My sons are spent.

1112
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:29,900
My line has ended.

1113
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,000
He's alive!

1114
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:37,200
The House of Stewards has failed.

1115
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:38,700
He needs medicine, my lord.

1116
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,300
My line has ended!

1117
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,700
My lord!

1118
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:00,400
Rohan...

1119
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:03,400
...has deserted us.

1120
01:56:17,300 --> 01:56:20,300
Théoden's betrayed me.

1121
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,800
Abandon your posts!

1122
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:37,500
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1123
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:48,700
Prepare for battle!

1124
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:52,300
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1125
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,300
Over here!

1126
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,300
Return to your posts!

1127
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:11,200
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1128
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,300
Stay where you are.

1129
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:40,000
We need more rubble!

1130
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:41,900
Watch out!

1131
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:44,500
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1132
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:47,800
Double up, men!

1133
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,900
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1134
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:00,700
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1135
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:41,300
Not at the towers!

1136
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:44,300
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1137
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,800
Bring them down!

1138
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,400
Fight them back!

1139
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:24,500
Peregrin Took!

1140
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,400
-Go back to the Citadel!
-They'd called us out to fight.

1141
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,700
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1142
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,800
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1143
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,600
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1144
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:29,300
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1145
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,300
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1146
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:39,700
Get back there and smash it down.

1147
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:41,800
But nothing can breach it.

1148
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:46,800
Grond will breach it.

1149
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:52,100
Bring up the wolf's head.

1150
02:01:55,100 --> 02:02:00,200
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1151
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:04,200
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1152
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:09,300
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1153
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:13,500
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1154
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,900
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1155
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:21,700
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1156
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:37,500
You may go no further.

1157
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:43,400
You will not enter Gondor.

1158
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:46,100
Who are you to deny us passage?

1159
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:49,800
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1160
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,600
Mind your aim.

1161
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,300
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1162
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:04,600
Prepare to be boarded.

1163
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:07,100
Boarded?

1164
02:03:07,300 --> 02:03:08,900
By you and whose army?

1165
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,500
This army.

1166
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:30,300
In there.

1167
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:33,700
What is this place?

1168
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:41,200
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1169
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:46,300
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1170
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,500
It's the only way.

1171
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,700
Go in...

1172
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:57,300
...or go back.

1173
02:03:59,900 --> 02:04:02,600
I can't go back.

1174
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:16,900
-What's that smell?
-Orcses' filth.

1175
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,100
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1176
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:26,700
Hurry.

1177
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:33,300
This way.

1178
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,700
Sméagol?

1179
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:40,700
Over here.

1180
02:04:48,700 --> 02:04:51,700
It's sticky. What is it?

1181
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:54,100
You'll see.

1182
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,500
Oh, yes.

1183
02:04:56,600 --> 02:04:59,700
You will see.

1184
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:09,800
Sméagol?

1185
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,300
Sméagol!

1186
02:05:14,900 --> 02:05:16,700
Sméagol!

1187
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:27,500
Sam.

1188
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:05,500
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1189
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:10,800
...I give you the light of Eärendil,
our most beloved star.

1190
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:14,700
May it be a light for you
In dark places...

1191
02:07:14,900 --> 02:07:18,500
...when all other lights go out.

1192
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:34,600
Naughty little fly

1193
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:37,900
Why does he cry?

1194
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:41,600
Caught in a web

1195
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:44,400
Soon you'll be....

1196
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,500
Eaten.

1197
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:24,700
Got away, did it, precious?

1198
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:26,900
Not this time.

1199
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:30,100
-Not this time!
-No!

1200
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:39,800
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1201
02:09:40,300 --> 02:09:42,800
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1202
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,800
We promised.

1203
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,300
You must believe us.

1204
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:49,100
It was the precious.

1205
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:53,900
The precious made us do it.

1206
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:13,100
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

1207
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:24,900
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1208
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:36,000
No!

1209
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,600
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1210
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:07,300
I'm so sorry.

1211
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,700
This task was appointed to you,
Frodo of the Shire.

1212
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:40,100
If you do not find a way...

1213
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:42,500
...no one will.

1214
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:17,500
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1215
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:19,900
The lower level's in flames.

1216
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,700
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1217
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:24,000
Time is against us.

1218
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:25,900
Make ready!

1219
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,800
Take heart, Merry.

1220
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,100
It will soon be over.

1221
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:32,100
My lady...

1222
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:35,200
...you are fair and brave...

1223
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:37,800
...and have much to live for...

1224
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:41,400
...and many who love you.

1225
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:46,700
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1226
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:50,300
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1227
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:54,700
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds....

1228
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:57,900
But I'm not.

1229
02:12:58,100 --> 02:12:59,800
I'm a Hobbit.

1230
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,800
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1231
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:10,300
I just want to help my friends.

1232
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:13,700
Frodo.

1233
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:16,200
Sam.

1234
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:19,700
Pippin.

1235
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:24,000
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1236
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:30,300
Prepare to move out!

1237
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:33,100
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1238
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:50,400
To battle.

1239
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:52,200
To battle.

1240
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:16,000
Back to the gate!

1241
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:18,400
Hurry!

1242
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:41,800
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

1243
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,200
Thus have I walked.

1244
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:48,300
And thus now will I sleep.

1245
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:56,200
Gondor is lost.

1246
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:59,900
There is no hope for Men.

1247
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,700
Why do the fools fly?

1248
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:21,100
Better to die sooner than late.

1249
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:25,100
For die we must.

1250
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:39,700
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

1251
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:46,500
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1252
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:51,700
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1253
02:15:55,200 --> 02:15:56,900
Bring wood and oil.

1254
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:00,900
Steady.

1255
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:03,100
Steady.

1256
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:19,300
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1257
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:23,800
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1258
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,100
Run!

1259
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,400
Volley!

1260
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,900
Fire!

1261
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:27,400
Let him go, you filth.

1262
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:30,900
Let him go!

1263
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:34,100
You will not touch him again.

1264
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:38,900
Come on and finish it.

1265
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:25,700
Back!

1266
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:37,300
Mr. Frodo.

1267
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:48,400
Oh, no.

1268
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:50,500
Frodo.

1269
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:52,500
Mr. Frodo.

1270
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,200
Wake up.

1271
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:04,200
Don't leave me here alone.

1272
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:08,000
Don't go where I can't follow.

1273
02:21:12,100 --> 02:21:13,400
Wake up.

1274
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:21,900
Not asleep.

1275
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,800
Dead.

1276
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:45,300
You get back, you scum!

1277
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:55,700
What's this?

1278
02:21:56,900 --> 02:21:59,500
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1279
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:03,800
Killed another one, has she?

1280
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,900
No.

1281
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:10,400
This fellow ain't dead.

1282
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,900
Not dead?

1283
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:18,700
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1284
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,600
Then she has her way with them.

1285
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,600
That's how she likes to feed.

1286
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:26,100
Fresh blood.

1287
02:22:26,300 --> 02:22:28,500
Get him to the tower!

1288
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:33,500
Samwise, you fool.

1289
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:36,300
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1290
02:22:36,500 --> 02:22:38,900
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1291
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:05,300
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1292
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:07,700
He is burning.

1293
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,100
Already burning.

1294
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:12,300
He's not dead.

1295
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,400
He's not dead!

1296
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:18,200
No! No!

1297
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:20,600
No! No!

1298
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:22,700
He's not dead!

1299
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:26,400
-Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
-No! No! No!

1300
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:29,700
I release you from my service.

1301
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,200
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1302
02:23:37,300 --> 02:23:39,500
Pour oil on the wood!

1303
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:43,100
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1304
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:46,400
-Hurry along there! Hurry along!
-Gandalf!

1305
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:48,100
Where is Gandalf?

1306
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:50,500
Gandalf!

1307
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:56,800
Retreat!

1308
02:23:58,900 --> 02:24:00,500
The city is breached!

1309
02:24:00,700 --> 02:24:03,500
Fall back to the second level!

1310
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:08,700
Get the women and children out!

1311
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:10,700
Get them out!

1312
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:12,300
Retreat!

1313
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:14,200
Come on. Come on.

1314
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:18,600
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1315
02:24:26,300 --> 02:24:28,600
Take them down!

1316
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:51,100
Fight. Fight to the last man!

1317
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,500
Fight for your lives!

1318
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:53,800
Gandalf!

1319
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,300
Gandalf!

1320
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:02,000
Denethor has lost his mind!

1321
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:04,300
He's burning Faramir alive!

1322
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:06,200
Up! Quickly!

1323
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:14,200
Go back to the abyss.

1324
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:18,700
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1325
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:25,100
Do you not know death when you see it,
old man?

1326
02:25:25,300 --> 02:25:29,700
This is my hour.

1327
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:40,400
Gandalf!

1328
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:52,300
You have failed.

1329
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:57,700
The world of Men will fall.

1330
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:54,100
Courage, Merry.

1331
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:56,500
Courage for our friends.

1332
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:02,900
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1333
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:06,100
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1334
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:16,900
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1335
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:18,300
Flank ready.

1336
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:21,200
Gamling, follow the king's banner
down the center.

1337
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:24,900
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1338
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:27,700
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1339
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:31,600
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

1340
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:36,800
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1341
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,500
...a sword-day, a red day...

1342
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:44,100
...ere the sun rises!

1343
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:55,700
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1344
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:03,800
Ride now!

1345
02:28:05,300 --> 02:28:07,300
Ride now!

1346
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:10,500
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1347
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:13,300
...and the world's ending!

1348
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:16,500
Death!

1349
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,700
Death!

1350
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:23,000
-Death!
-Death!

1351
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:24,900
-Death!
-Death!

1352
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:28,900
-Death!
-Death!

1353
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:36,100
Forth Eorlingas!

1354
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:19,000
Fire!

1355
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:23,800
Death!

1356
02:29:27,900 --> 02:29:29,100
Charge!

1357
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:31,100
Fire at will!

1358
02:30:26,100 --> 02:30:29,200
Set a fire in our flesh.

1359
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:47,800
Stay this madness!

1360
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:56,400
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1361
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,400
...but against the power that has risen
in the east...

1362
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:03,700
...there is no victory.

1363
02:31:31,700 --> 02:31:33,300
No!

1364
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:36,100
You will not take my son from me!

1365
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:38,500
No! No!

1366
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:50,500
Faramir.

1367
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:07,300
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1368
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:35,500
Drive them to the river!

1369
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:40,000
Make safe the city!

1370
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:20,300
Re-form the line!

1371
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:23,200
Re-form the line!

1372
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,500
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1373
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:35,100
Charge!

1374
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:52,200
Cut him down!

1375
02:35:17,800 --> 02:35:20,300
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1376
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:23,800
Left!

1377
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:42,100
Aim for their heads!

1378
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:51,000
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1379
02:36:04,300 --> 02:36:05,700
Merry!

1380
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:18,100
I didn't think it would end this way.

1381
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:20,700
End?

1382
02:37:21,900 --> 02:37:23,900
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1383
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:29,300
Death is just another path...

1384
02:37:29,900 --> 02:37:31,500
...one that we all must take.

1385
02:37:32,700 --> 02:37:36,000
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1386
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:39,700
...and all turns to silver glass.

1387
02:37:41,800 --> 02:37:43,600
And then you see it.

1388
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:47,700
What, Gandalf?

1389
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:50,100
See what?

1390
02:37:51,300 --> 02:37:53,400
White shores...

1391
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,300
...and beyond.

1392
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:00,500
A far green country...

1393
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:03,900
...under a swift sunrise.

1394
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:09,300
Well...

1395
02:38:09,400 --> 02:38:11,000
...that isn't so bad.

1396
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:12,500
No.

1397
02:38:14,500 --> 02:38:16,100
No, it isn't.

1398
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:35,000
Rally to me! To me!

1399
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:59,300
Feast on his flesh.

1400
02:39:03,500 --> 02:39:05,700
I will kill you if you touch him.

1401
02:39:05,900 --> 02:39:11,100
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

1402
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:19,800
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1403
02:40:20,200 --> 02:40:22,400
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1404
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:25,600
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1405
02:40:40,500 --> 02:40:42,500
There's plenty for the both of us.

1406
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:44,700
May the best Dwarf win.

1407
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:03,500
You fool.

1408
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:07,000
No man can kill me.

1409
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:12,300
Die now.

1410
02:41:22,600 --> 02:41:24,500
I am no man.

1411
02:41:40,300 --> 02:41:43,700
-Fifteen! Sixteen!
-Seventeen!

1412
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:53,000
Merry!

1413
02:42:33,300 --> 02:42:35,000
Legolas!

1414
02:42:56,500 --> 02:42:58,700
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1415
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:46,200
That still only counts as one!

1416
02:43:46,400 --> 02:43:48,400
Come on, then. Come on!

1417
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:33,100
I know your face...

1418
02:44:34,900 --> 02:44:36,600
...Éowyn.

1419
02:44:39,100 --> 02:44:41,400
My eyes darken.

1420
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:43,800
No.

1421
02:44:44,600 --> 02:44:46,100
No.

1422
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:50,500
I am going to save you.

1423
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:54,100
You already did.

1424
02:44:57,600 --> 02:44:59,100
Éowyn...

1425
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:03,000
...my body is broken.

1426
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:10,200
You have to let me go.

1427
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:18,300
I go to my fathers...

1428
02:45:19,700 --> 02:45:22,400
...in whose mighty company...

1429
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:26,100
... I shall not now feel ashamed.

1430
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:43,500
Éowyn.

1431
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:30,500
Release us.

1432
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:34,000
Bad idea.

1433
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:37,800
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1434
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:39,900
You gave us your word.

1435
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:43,600
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1436
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:46,200
Go.

1437
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:48,600
Be at peace.

1438
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:31,000
Merry.

1439
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:34,700
No!

1440
02:47:38,400 --> 02:47:40,700
No!

1441
02:48:03,600 --> 02:48:07,300
With a sigh

1442
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:11,000
You turn away

1443
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:15,000
With a deepening heart

1444
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:19,700
No more words to say

1445
02:48:19,900 --> 02:48:23,300
You will find

1446
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:27,300
That the world has changed

1447
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:31,400
Forever

1448
02:48:55,100 --> 02:49:02,600
And the trees are now
Turning from green to gold

1449
02:49:06,300 --> 02:49:11,400
And the sun is now fading

1450
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:17,900
I wish I could hold you

1451
02:49:18,100 --> 02:49:20,700
Closer

1452
02:49:23,500 --> 02:49:24,600
Merry!

1453
02:49:26,200 --> 02:49:28,100
Merry!

1454
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,700
Merry.

1455
02:49:43,100 --> 02:49:44,300
Merry, it's me.

1456
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:48,300
It's Pippin.

1457
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:52,900
I knew you'd find me.

1458
02:49:53,100 --> 02:49:54,200
Yes.

1459
02:49:56,600 --> 02:49:58,500
Are you going to leave me?

1460
02:49:59,100 --> 02:50:00,700
No, Merry.

1461
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,100
I'm going to look after you.

1462
02:50:46,300 --> 02:50:47,700
Hands off!

1463
02:50:47,800 --> 02:50:50,900
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1464
02:50:51,100 --> 02:50:55,100
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1465
02:50:56,600 --> 02:51:00,300
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1466
02:51:01,100 --> 02:51:06,000
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1467
02:51:25,900 --> 02:51:27,600
The scum tried to knife me.

1468
02:51:27,800 --> 02:51:29,400
Kill him!

1469
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:10,300
That's for Frodo!

1470
02:53:10,700 --> 02:53:12,700
And for the Shire!

1471
02:53:16,200 --> 02:53:18,200
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1472
02:53:46,500 --> 02:53:49,700
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1473
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:55,300
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1474
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:03,900
Not if I stick you first.

1475
02:54:04,100 --> 02:54:05,600
Sam!

1476
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:12,400
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1477
02:54:12,600 --> 02:54:14,500
Sorry for everything.

1478
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:18,500
-Let's get you out of here.
-It's too late. It's over.

1479
02:54:18,700 --> 02:54:21,400
They've taken it. Sam...

1480
02:54:22,200 --> 02:54:23,600
...they took the Ring.

1481
02:54:24,400 --> 02:54:26,900
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1482
02:54:38,400 --> 02:54:40,500
I thought I'd lost you.

1483
02:54:40,900 --> 02:54:42,500
So I took it.

1484
02:54:43,700 --> 02:54:45,700
Only for safekeeping.

1485
02:54:46,900 --> 02:54:48,500
Give it to me.

1486
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,100
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1487
02:54:58,600 --> 02:54:59,700
Sam.

1488
02:55:01,300 --> 02:55:03,100
Give me the Ring.

1489
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:24,300
You must understand.

1490
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:29,400
The Ring is my burden.

1491
02:55:30,500 --> 02:55:32,600
It will destroy you, Sam.

1492
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:37,500
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1493
02:55:38,800 --> 02:55:40,300
We best find you some clothes.

1494
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:43,400
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1495
02:56:04,300 --> 02:56:06,400
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1496
02:56:06,900 --> 02:56:09,100
We made it to Mordor.

1497
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:11,900
There are so many of them.

1498
02:56:12,900 --> 02:56:15,300
We'll never get through unseen.

1499
02:56:20,300 --> 02:56:23,500
It's him, the Eye.

1500
02:56:30,900 --> 02:56:33,400
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1501
02:56:33,800 --> 02:56:35,800
There's nothing for it.

1502
02:56:38,700 --> 02:56:42,900
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1503
02:56:51,900 --> 02:56:55,000
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1504
02:56:56,300 --> 02:56:59,000
The darkness is deepening.

1505
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:01,400
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

1506
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:03,500
It's only a matter of time.

1507
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,300
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1508
02:57:08,300 --> 02:57:12,600
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1509
02:57:12,800 --> 02:57:14,500
Let him stay there.

1510
02:57:14,700 --> 02:57:17,300
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1511
02:57:17,400 --> 02:57:22,400
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1512
02:57:28,900 --> 02:57:31,300
I've sent him to his death.

1513
02:57:32,800 --> 02:57:34,000
No.

1514
02:57:34,500 --> 02:57:36,800
There is still hope for Frodo.

1515
02:57:37,100 --> 02:57:41,100
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1516
02:57:42,100 --> 02:57:44,600
-We can give him that.
-How?

1517
02:57:44,900 --> 02:57:47,500
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1518
02:57:47,700 --> 02:57:49,700
Empty his lands.

1519
02:57:49,900 --> 02:57:52,900
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1520
02:57:53,500 --> 02:57:56,300
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1521
02:57:56,500 --> 02:57:58,000
Not for ourselves.

1522
02:57:58,200 --> 02:58:03,600
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1523
02:58:05,300 --> 02:58:08,900
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1524
02:58:09,700 --> 02:58:10,800
A diversion.

1525
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:12,700
Certainty of death...

1526
02:58:12,900 --> 02:58:15,500
...small chance of success...

1527
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:17,900
...what are we waiting for?

1528
02:58:18,400 --> 02:58:20,700
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1529
02:58:21,500 --> 02:58:23,500
He will not take the bait.

1530
02:58:24,900 --> 02:58:27,300
Oh, I think he will.

1531
02:59:00,300 --> 02:59:02,800
Long have you hunted me.

1532
02:59:03,700 --> 02:59:04,900
Long have I eluded you.

1533
02:59:06,700 --> 02:59:08,200
No more.

1534
02:59:09,800 --> 02:59:12,100
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1535
02:59:54,800 --> 02:59:57,200
The city has fallen silent.

1536
02:59:58,800 --> 03:00:01,700
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1537
03:00:02,500 --> 03:00:04,100
It grows so cold.

1538
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,900
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1539
03:00:16,100 --> 03:00:19,100
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

1540
03:00:46,600 --> 03:00:48,100
Look, the Orcs...

1541
03:00:48,600 --> 03:00:50,500
...they're moving off.

1542
03:00:51,600 --> 03:00:53,500
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1543
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:55,900
...some luck at last.

1544
03:00:56,100 --> 03:00:57,900
Move it, you slugs!

1545
03:00:59,100 --> 03:01:02,300
Come on! Faster!

1546
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:13,100
Come along, you scum....

1547
03:01:13,300 --> 03:01:17,400
I'll whip you down to the bone, you....

1548
03:01:20,200 --> 03:01:21,700
Come on!

1549
03:01:21,900 --> 03:01:24,100
What have I told you?!

1550
03:01:30,700 --> 03:01:32,100
Get up!

1551
03:01:32,500 --> 03:01:35,000
Come on, you slugs!

1552
03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:38,700
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1553
03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:43,500
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1554
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:59,700
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1555
03:02:08,700 --> 03:02:12,100
Don't you know we're at war?

1556
03:02:33,500 --> 03:02:36,300
Company, halt!

1557
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:43,200
Inspection!

1558
03:02:43,400 --> 03:02:45,700
Sam, help me.

1559
03:02:45,900 --> 03:02:47,600
Mr. Frodo!

1560
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:52,700
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

1561
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:54,600
It's so heavy.

1562
03:03:03,400 --> 03:03:04,500
Oh, no.

1563
03:03:09,900 --> 03:03:11,800
What do I do?
What do we do?

1564
03:03:14,700 --> 03:03:15,800
-Hit me.
-What?

1565
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:17,900
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1566
03:03:18,100 --> 03:03:19,600
Get off of me!

1567
03:03:20,300 --> 03:03:22,500
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1568
03:03:30,800 --> 03:03:32,700
Get off of me!

1569
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:35,500
Break it up! Break it up!

1570
03:03:37,900 --> 03:03:42,300
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1571
03:03:42,500 --> 03:03:44,700
Go, Sam. Now!

1572
03:03:53,300 --> 03:03:54,700
Move along, scum!

1573
03:03:54,900 --> 03:03:56,700
Back in the line!

1574
03:03:57,200 --> 03:03:58,900
You maggots!

1575
03:03:59,600 --> 03:04:02,500
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1576
03:04:04,800 --> 03:04:08,100
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1577
03:04:10,700 --> 03:04:12,600
Move it!

1578
03:04:54,900 --> 03:04:56,900
I can't....

1579
03:04:57,000 --> 03:05:00,600
I can't....
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1580
03:05:00,800 --> 03:05:01,900
It's.... It's....

1581
03:05:02,100 --> 03:05:04,500
It's such a weight to carry.

1582
03:05:05,400 --> 03:05:06,400
It....

1583
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:08,400
Such a weight.

1584
03:05:13,200 --> 03:05:15,500
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1585
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,900
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1586
03:05:34,500 --> 03:05:36,300
Mr. Frodo.

1587
03:05:37,700 --> 03:05:39,100
Look.

1588
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:43,400
There is light...

1589
03:05:43,700 --> 03:05:46,000
...and beauty up there...

1590
03:05:46,200 --> 03:05:47,800
...that no shadow can touch.

1591
03:06:36,800 --> 03:06:38,300
Take mine.

1592
03:06:38,800 --> 03:06:40,900
There's a few drops left.

1593
03:06:55,500 --> 03:06:57,900
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1594
03:06:58,800 --> 03:07:01,900
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1595
03:07:52,600 --> 03:07:54,700
Frodo, get down!

1596
03:07:56,400 --> 03:07:58,200
Hide!

1597
03:08:07,900 --> 03:08:09,900
Frodo!

1598
03:08:15,500 --> 03:08:16,800
Where are they?

1599
03:08:51,400 --> 03:08:54,300
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1600
03:08:55,200 --> 03:08:57,900
Let justice be done upon him!

1601
03:09:39,700 --> 03:09:43,500
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1602
03:09:49,100 --> 03:09:52,600
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1603
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:56,000
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1604
03:09:56,200 --> 03:09:59,000
...faithless and accursed.

1605
03:09:59,200 --> 03:10:02,400
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1606
03:10:02,600 --> 03:10:05,200
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1607
03:10:06,200 --> 03:10:08,600
Old Greybeard.

1608
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:14,100
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1609
03:10:18,900 --> 03:10:20,100
Frodo.

1610
03:10:22,900 --> 03:10:24,300
Frodo.

1611
03:10:25,200 --> 03:10:26,400
-Silence.
-No!

1612
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:28,500
Silence!

1613
03:10:30,200 --> 03:10:33,800
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1614
03:10:34,800 --> 03:10:38,700
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1615
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:49,500
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1616
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:54,000
And he did, Gandalf.

1617
03:10:54,200 --> 03:10:55,900
He did.

1618
03:11:02,600 --> 03:11:04,000
And who is this?

1619
03:11:04,200 --> 03:11:06,200
Isildur's heir?

1620
03:11:06,400 --> 03:11:09,200
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1621
03:11:13,800 --> 03:11:16,300
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1622
03:11:18,300 --> 03:11:19,500
I do not believe it.

1623
03:11:21,400 --> 03:11:22,700
I will not.

1624
03:11:38,200 --> 03:11:39,900
Pull back.

1625
03:11:40,200 --> 03:11:42,100
Pull back!

1626
03:11:53,800 --> 03:11:55,800
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1627
03:11:58,200 --> 03:12:01,000
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1628
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:02,900
Something's drawn its gaze.

1629
03:12:19,800 --> 03:12:22,400
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1630
03:12:24,400 --> 03:12:28,200
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1631
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:32,800
I see in your eyes...

1632
03:12:33,200 --> 03:12:37,000
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1633
03:12:38,900 --> 03:12:42,700
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1634
03:12:42,800 --> 03:12:46,000
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1635
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:48,700
But it is not this day.

1636
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,900
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1637
03:12:52,100 --> 03:12:54,800
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1638
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,300
But it is not this day.

1639
03:12:57,500 --> 03:12:59,100
This day we fight!

1640
03:13:01,500 --> 03:13:05,000
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1641
03:13:05,200 --> 03:13:09,200
... I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1642
03:14:34,100 --> 03:14:37,500
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1643
03:14:37,900 --> 03:14:40,100
What about side by side with a friend?

1644
03:14:43,600 --> 03:14:45,200
Aye.

1645
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:47,700
I could do that.

1646
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:18,800
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1647
03:15:21,700 --> 03:15:23,800
It'll be spring soon.

1648
03:15:24,600 --> 03:15:27,200
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1649
03:15:27,400 --> 03:15:30,900
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1650
03:15:32,200 --> 03:15:36,000
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1651
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:41,200
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1652
03:15:43,100 --> 03:15:45,500
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1653
03:15:47,000 --> 03:15:48,600
No, Sam.

1654
03:15:48,800 --> 03:15:51,600
I can't recall the taste of food...

1655
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:55,900
...nor the sound of water...

1656
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:59,500
...nor the touch of grass.

1657
03:16:00,400 --> 03:16:01,900
I'm...

1658
03:16:02,700 --> 03:16:04,000
...naked in the dark.

1659
03:16:05,600 --> 03:16:07,800
There's-- There's nothing.

1660
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:12,500
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1661
03:16:13,700 --> 03:16:15,500
I can see him...

1662
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:17,500
...with my waking eyes.

1663
03:16:18,600 --> 03:16:20,900
Then let us be rid of it...

1664
03:16:21,500 --> 03:16:23,600
...once and for all.

1665
03:16:24,300 --> 03:16:26,300
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1666
03:16:26,500 --> 03:16:29,000
I can't carry it for you...

1667
03:16:29,400 --> 03:16:31,300
...but I can carry you.

1668
03:16:31,900 --> 03:16:33,500
Come on!

1669
03:17:02,700 --> 03:17:05,500
Aragorn.

1670
03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:19,100
Elessar.

1671
03:17:30,600 --> 03:17:32,900
For Frodo.

1672
03:18:06,500 --> 03:18:07,900
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1673
03:18:08,600 --> 03:18:10,700
A doorway.

1674
03:18:11,300 --> 03:18:12,900
We're almost there.

1675
03:18:15,100 --> 03:18:18,900
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1676
03:18:32,300 --> 03:18:33,900
Mustn't go that way.

1677
03:18:35,400 --> 03:18:37,700
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1678
03:18:37,900 --> 03:18:39,500
You swore!

1679
03:18:39,700 --> 03:18:41,700
You swore on the precious!

1680
03:18:43,500 --> 03:18:45,400
Sméagol promised!

1681
03:18:46,300 --> 03:18:48,200
Sméagol lied.

1682
03:19:38,600 --> 03:19:40,300
Frodo!

1683
03:20:06,400 --> 03:20:08,000
Eagles.

1684
03:20:09,400 --> 03:20:10,800
The eagles are coming!

1685
03:20:32,700 --> 03:20:34,500
Frodo!

1686
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:40,800
I'm here, Sam.

1687
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:49,500
Destroy it!

1688
03:20:59,600 --> 03:21:02,800
Go on! Now!

1689
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:05,400
Throw it in the fire!

1690
03:21:18,200 --> 03:21:20,800
What are you waiting for?

1691
03:21:22,600 --> 03:21:24,900
Just let it go!

1692
03:21:56,700 --> 03:21:58,900
The Ring is mine.

1693
03:22:02,300 --> 03:22:03,900
No.

1694
03:22:04,400 --> 03:22:05,600
No.

1695
03:22:13,700 --> 03:22:16,200
No!

1696
03:23:56,400 --> 03:23:58,200
Yes!

1697
03:23:59,300 --> 03:24:00,900
Yes!

1698
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:04,800
Precious! Precious!

1699
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:08,000
Precious! Precious!

1700
03:24:58,800 --> 03:25:00,500
Give me your hand!

1701
03:25:08,500 --> 03:25:10,800
Take my hand!

1702
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:14,700
No!

1703
03:25:21,600 --> 03:25:23,500
Don't you let go.

1704
03:25:27,900 --> 03:25:29,400
Don't let go.

1705
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:32,400
Reach!

1706
03:26:57,900 --> 03:27:00,700
Frodo!

1707
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:04,100
Frodo!

1708
03:28:22,200 --> 03:28:23,900
It's gone.

1709
03:28:28,200 --> 03:28:29,900
It's done.

1710
03:28:30,400 --> 03:28:32,300
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1711
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:35,900
It's over now.

1712
03:29:00,500 --> 03:29:02,800
I can see the Shire.

1713
03:29:04,900 --> 03:29:07,100
The Brandywine River.

1714
03:29:09,200 --> 03:29:11,100
Bag End.

1715
03:29:13,400 --> 03:29:15,900
Gandalf's fireworks.

1716
03:29:16,400 --> 03:29:19,900
The lights in the Party Tree.

1717
03:29:21,400 --> 03:29:24,400
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1718
03:29:25,500 --> 03:29:28,100
She had ribbons in her hair.

1719
03:29:30,900 --> 03:29:33,700
If ever I was to marry someone...

1720
03:29:34,600 --> 03:29:36,700
...it would've been her.

1721
03:29:38,100 --> 03:29:40,100
It would've been her.

1722
03:29:51,800 --> 03:29:54,800
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1723
03:29:59,000 --> 03:30:01,700
...here at the end of all things.

1724
03:31:47,000 --> 03:31:48,900
Gandalf?

1725
03:32:07,800 --> 03:32:09,700
Frodo!

1726
03:32:28,600 --> 03:32:30,400
Gimli!

1727
03:34:09,200 --> 03:34:12,700
Now come the days of the king.

1728
03:34:17,600 --> 03:34:19,800
May they be blessed.

1729
03:34:39,200 --> 03:34:41,800
This day does not belong to one man...

1730
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:43,700
...but to all.

1731
03:34:45,400 --> 03:34:48,100
Let us together rebuild this world...

1732
03:34:48,300 --> 03:34:52,400
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

1733
03:37:20,600 --> 03:37:22,500
My friends...

1734
03:37:27,600 --> 03:37:30,200
...you bow to no one.

1735
03:38:12,600 --> 03:38:14,600
And thus it was.

1736
03:38:14,800 --> 03:38:18,200
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1737
03:38:18,400 --> 03:38:20,800
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1738
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:25,300
...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

1739
03:38:25,500 --> 03:38:27,800
...was ended.

1740
03:38:32,600 --> 03:38:37,200
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

1741
03:38:37,400 --> 03:38:41,400
...we found ourselves
looklng upon a familiar sight.

1742
03:38:43,800 --> 03:38:46,400
We were home.

1743
03:38:52,700 --> 03:38:54,500
Hi.

1744
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:13,100
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1745
03:39:59,200 --> 03:40:00,700
More of the same, Rosie.

1746
03:40:00,900 --> 03:40:02,800
Good night, lads.

1747
03:40:58,000 --> 03:41:01,900
How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

1748
03:41:03,200 --> 03:41:05,300
How do you go on...

1749
03:41:05,400 --> 03:41:10,400
...when in your heart
you begin to understand...

1750
03:41:11,600 --> 03:41:14,500
...there is no going back?

1751
03:41:15,200 --> 03:41:18,700
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

1752
03:41:19,200 --> 03:41:21,900
...some hurts that go too deep...

1753
03:41:23,600 --> 03:41:26,300
...that have taken hold.

1754
03:41:46,200 --> 03:41:49,100
There and back again...
a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins

1755
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:04,700
Mr. Frodo?

1756
03:42:08,000 --> 03:42:09,300
What is it?

1757
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:14,800
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1758
03:42:15,500 --> 03:42:18,100
It's never really healed.

1759
03:42:21,900 --> 03:42:26,900
"There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.

1760
03:42:27,600 --> 03:42:31,300
And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."

1761
03:42:31,800 --> 03:42:33,800
You finished it.

1762
03:42:36,600 --> 03:42:38,000
Not quite.

1763
03:42:38,800 --> 03:42:41,300
There's room for a little more.

1764
03:42:43,800 --> 03:42:47,800
Bilbo once told me his part
In this tale would end...

1765
03:42:48,000 --> 03:42:51,100
...that each of us must come and go
In the telling.

1766
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:54,700
Bilbo's story was now over.

1767
03:42:55,200 --> 03:42:58,000
There would be no more journeys
for him...

1768
03:42:58,200 --> 03:42:59,600
...save one.

1769
03:43:00,400 --> 03:43:03,800
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

1770
03:43:04,000 --> 03:43:05,900
To the harbour, Bilbo.

1771
03:43:06,000 --> 03:43:08,600
The Elves have accorded you
a special honour...

1772
03:43:08,800 --> 03:43:11,300
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1773
03:43:13,000 --> 03:43:14,500
Frodo...

1774
03:43:15,900 --> 03:43:20,300
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1775
03:43:20,900 --> 03:43:23,000
The one I gave you.

1776
03:43:26,500 --> 03:43:28,600
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1777
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:33,500
I'm afraid I lost it.

1778
03:43:33,700 --> 03:43:35,400
Oh.

1779
03:43:36,000 --> 03:43:37,400
Pity.

1780
03:43:40,100 --> 03:43:43,800
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1781
03:44:11,800 --> 03:44:16,600
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1782
03:44:30,200 --> 03:44:33,400
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1783
03:44:34,200 --> 03:44:36,800
The time has come...

1784
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:40,100
...for the dominion of Men.

1785
03:44:41,200 --> 03:44:43,900
The sea calls us home.

1786
03:44:52,000 --> 03:44:54,100
I think I'm...

1787
03:44:54,300 --> 03:44:58,500
...quite ready
for another adventure.

1788
03:45:28,300 --> 03:45:30,500
Farewell...

1789
03:45:30,600 --> 03:45:33,300
...my brave Hobbits.

1790
03:45:35,200 --> 03:45:37,100
My work is now finished.

1791
03:45:40,800 --> 03:45:45,500
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1792
03:45:46,200 --> 03:45:48,900
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1793
03:45:52,300 --> 03:45:54,700
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1794
03:45:55,300 --> 03:45:59,100
...for not all tears are an evil.

1795
03:46:16,000 --> 03:46:17,800
It is time, Frodo.

1796
03:46:23,200 --> 03:46:25,100
What does he mean?

1797
03:46:27,400 --> 03:46:30,200
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1798
03:46:31,700 --> 03:46:34,300
And it has been saved.

1799
03:46:37,900 --> 03:46:40,400
But not for me.

1800
03:46:41,300 --> 03:46:43,700
You don't mean that.

1801
03:46:44,800 --> 03:46:46,800
You can't leave.

1802
03:46:55,000 --> 03:46:57,500
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1803
03:50:21,900 --> 03:50:24,700
My dear Sam.

1804
03:50:26,500 --> 03:50:29,700
You cannot always be torn in two.

1805
03:50:29,900 --> 03:50:33,800
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

1806
03:50:34,600 --> 03:50:39,800
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

1807
03:50:41,000 --> 03:50:44,000
Your part In the story will go on.

1808
03:50:44,800 --> 03:50:46,400
Well...

1809
03:50:48,200 --> 03:50:49,900
... I'm back.

1810
03:52:28,300 --> 03:52:32,100
Lay down

1811
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:37,900
Your sweet and weary head

1812
03:52:39,500 --> 03:52:42,900
Night is falling

1813
03:52:43,600 --> 03:52:48,200
You have come
To journey's end

1814
03:52:48,900 --> 03:52:52,500
Sleep now

1815
03:52:52,600 --> 03:52:58,100
And dream
Of the ones who came before

1816
03:52:59,800 --> 03:53:03,500
They are calling

1817
03:53:03,700 --> 03:53:07,600
From across
The distant shore

1818
03:53:09,200 --> 03:53:13,900
Why do you weep?

1819
03:53:14,000 --> 03:53:18,800
What are these tears
Upon your face?

1820
03:53:19,000 --> 03:53:23,800
Soon you will see

1821
03:53:24,000 --> 03:53:28,700
All of your fears
Will pass away

1822
03:53:28,900 --> 03:53:33,800
Safe In my arms

1823
03:53:34,000 --> 03:53:38,300
You're only sleeping

1824
03:53:38,400 --> 03:53:43,200
What can you see

1825
03:53:43,400 --> 03:53:48,400
On the horizon?

1826
03:53:48,600 --> 03:53:52,900
Why do the white gulls

1827
03:53:53,100 --> 03:53:57,600
Call?

1828
03:53:58,700 --> 03:54:03,100
Across the sea

1829
03:54:03,300 --> 03:54:08,300
A pale moon rises

1830
03:54:08,500 --> 03:54:11,100
The ships have come

1831
03:54:11,300 --> 03:54:16,800
To carry you home

1832
03:54:19,000 --> 03:54:23,300
And all will turn

1833
03:54:23,500 --> 03:54:28,600
To silver glass

1834
03:54:28,800 --> 03:54:32,900
A light on the water

1835
03:54:33,000 --> 03:54:38,300
All souls pass

1836
03:54:38,500 --> 03:54:42,500
Hope fades

1837
03:54:44,000 --> 03:54:48,700
Into the world of night

1838
03:54:49,400 --> 03:54:53,100
Through shadows falling

1839
03:54:53,900 --> 03:54:58,800
Out of memory and time

1840
03:54:59,500 --> 03:55:03,000
Don't say

1841
03:55:03,800 --> 03:55:08,600
We have come now to the end

1842
03:55:09,400 --> 03:55:13,600
White shores are calling

1843
03:55:13,800 --> 03:55:17,200
You and I will meet again

1844
03:55:17,400 --> 03:55:23,500
And you'll be here
In my arms

1845
03:55:24,700 --> 03:55:28,600
Just sleeping

1846
03:55:28,800 --> 03:55:33,400
What can you see

1847
03:55:33,600 --> 03:55:38,300
On the horizon?

1848
03:55:38,500 --> 03:55:43,100
Why do the white gulls

1849
03:55:43,300 --> 03:55:48,500
Call?

1850
03:55:48,600 --> 03:55:53,500
Across the sea

1851
03:55:53,700 --> 03:55:58,500
A pale moon rlses

1852
03:55:58,600 --> 03:56:01,300
The ships have come

1853
03:56:01,500 --> 03:56:07,500
To carry you home

1854
03:56:08,700 --> 03:56:13,600
And all will turn

1855
03:56:14,200 --> 03:56:18,800
To silver glass

1856
03:56:19,000 --> 03:56:22,900
A light on the water

1857
03:56:23,100 --> 03:56:26,800
Grey ships pass

1858
03:56:27,000 --> 03:56:32,400
Into the west
