00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,972
Ju-on: A curse born when a person dies
in a powerful rage.

2
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:49,009
It gathers where the dead person lived,
and becomes a “stain”.

3
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:54,448
Anyone who touches it dies,
and a new curse is born.

The bodies of Yoshiyuki Matsuoka,

00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,431
his wife Mariko and son Takashi

8
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,733
were found at 10:20 am today at

9
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,604
their home in Suginami, Tokyo.

10
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,008

Co-Producer Toshinori Nishimae

12
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,715
All three victims appear...

13
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:31,619
to have bled to death from

14
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,287
multiple external wounds...

Koji Seto

17
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,031
The police set up an investigative

18
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,799
team the same day...

19
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:50,371
and launched a full murder enquiry.

20
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:54,542
The incident occurred on the night
of the 26th or morning of the 27th...

Masanobu Katsumura

29
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:18,966
...no sign of theft, it is thought
likely to be a grudge.

30
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,468
According to neighbors,
the Matsuokas were...

31
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:25,873
Original JU-ON Concept Created by
Takashi Shimizu

32
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,477

BLACK GHOST

35
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,926
Yeah, the family massacre.

36
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:49,463
I'm standing in front of the house.

37
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,132
It's terrifying!

38
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,104
What? Me?

39
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,807
You dope! No way!

40
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,610
Anyway, you coming over today?

41
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:19,693
TETSUYA

42
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,779
Hello.

43
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,892
So she does have a boyfriend.

44
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,046
Shit!

45
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,942
What the hell!

46
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,948
It's nothing.

47
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,750
I'm telling the truth.

48
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,219
You always listen to your
neighbor's sex life?

49
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:00,421
It wasn't like that.

50
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,722
What's your neighbor like?

51
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,124
I've seen her. A total babe!

52
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,859
She's a pharmacist, right?

53
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,561
A nurse.

54
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,298
What a shame, you liking her and all.

55
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,400
That's not the point!

56
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,836
There was something weird about her.

57
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,439
Yuko wasn't like that before.

58
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,242
Yuko! Were you that close to her?

59
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,814
Hey. Remember that family massacre?

60
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,183
Your next-door neighbor!

61
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,117
What about her?

62
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,986
Maybe... she's the killer!

63
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,456
What? No way.

64
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:41,061
A delicate girl like her might
be the killer, amazingly!

65
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:46,266
Overloaded with work,
groped by doctors... Boom!

66
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,768
She snaps! Kills everyone!

67
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,703
Scary!

68
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,476
We'll watch the place until
you get back.

69
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:56,944
Don't do anything stupid!

70
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,779
We won't. Now get going.

71
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,914
Bye.
Bye.

72
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,954
Stop it! Not here!

73
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,022
What's wrong with here?

74
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:15,088
Yuko?

75
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,928
You OK?

76
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,884
What's wrong?

77
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,552
I heard a weird voice.

78
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,055
You're imagining things.

79
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:35,102
YUKO

80
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,054
Fukie?

81
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:14,041
Always fooling around!

82
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,375
Where's your mom?

83
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,443
She was just here.

84
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,078
She's gone to work.

85
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,048
Your mom is a hard worker.

86
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,417
You should learn from her.

87
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,318
Shall I change your pajamas?

88
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,289
When can I go home?

89
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:34,661
I'm not sure. Your latest test results
aren't back yet.

90
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,064
What's wrong with me?

91
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,734
Is it my body? Or my mind?

92
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:44,304
You're so lively, I'm sure there's
no problem.

93
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,642
I know.

94
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,414
I'm going to die soon.

95
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:59,986
She said that?

96
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,223
Girls her age are very imaginative.

97
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,926
Well, take good care of her.

98
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,295
She likes you.

99
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:09,963
Of course.

100
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,998
Tell me when her mother returns.

101
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,202
I have the new test results.

102
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,578
Yokota-san, please come in.

103
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,057
Good-night then.

104
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,326
Good-night.

105
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,138
What is it?

106
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,574
It's nothing!

107
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:05,445
Sorry to wake you. Goodnight.

108
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,056
Hello!

109
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,959
Yuko!

110
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,529
Are you coming home now?

111
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,697
Yes.

112
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:26,233
I'm going to my part-time job.

113
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,135
Uh, right... Work hard.

114
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,304
Come on! What's wrong?

115
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,571
Not enough sleep?

116
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,273
Sorry.

117
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,843
Can you switch with me on Room 303?

118
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,579
Huh? You mean Fukie?

119
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,282
You can't still be worrying about that?

120
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,784
No, it's not that.

121
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,553
Fukie likes you the best.

122
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,688
She'll be heartbroken.

123
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:55,789
But...

124
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,191
Don't worry about it!

125
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,517
Fukie?

126
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:51,111
Stop messing around!

127
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:25,538
AYANO

128
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:40,487
Pretty wild, eh? Probably because
of the recession.

129
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,059
Is it an accident?

130
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,062
Or a crime?

131
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,632
Can you stop at the next traffic light?

132
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,034
Just in front of the light?

133
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,269
OK.

134
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,239
Isn't it a bit further?

135
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:02,575
It's OK. My house is hard to find.

136
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:08,214
Ayano. How about one more drink?

137
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,251
No thanks. I've work tomorrow.

138
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,796
This is for the taxi.

139
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,231
Forget it.

140
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,334
I was the one who called the cab.

141
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,437
You sure?

142
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:36,976
You really OK?

143
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,611
See you tomorrow.

144
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,013
Stay out of dark alleys.

145
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,448
Thank you.

146
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,961
I'm more worried about pervs
like you!

147
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,444
Boss?

148
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,817
Say something!

149
00:21:53,112 --> 00:22:01,921
FUKIE

150
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,378
Miss!

151
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,854
Fukie!

152
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,858
You OK? I heard you fainted?

153
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,595
Her blood pressure was low, that's all.

154
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,463
You really OK?

155
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,780
Dad's here!

156
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,790
Ah, Fukie. You alright?

157
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,493
What are you doing here?

158
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,630
I needed something for work
so I dropped by.

159
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,965
Fukie, have you eaten?

160
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,500
Not yet.

161
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:58,704
You poor thing! Nobody's fed you yet?

162
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,641
Shall we go out to eat?

163
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:03,843
She fainted at school today.

164
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,679
Ls that true?

165
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,015
It's just anemia.

166
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:12,885
In that case, shall we go for a steak?

167
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,253
Or barbecue?

168
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,523
You'll eat here today, right, Fukie?

169
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:23,029
Why don't you cook tomorrow?

170
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,399
You never change!

171
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,869
What now?

172
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,127
Fukie.

173
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:20,786
You'll kill a woman with this hand.

174
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:31,964
Fukie!

175
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,468
Fukie!

176
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:42,341
Fukie!

177
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:51,183
Yokota-san, please come in.

178
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,322
Fukie, wait there please.

179
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:08,968
The results show the brain is
quite normal.

180
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:13,706
Which means...

181
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,744
The problem is psychological...

182
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,247
Psychological?

183
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,051
Your daughter's symptoms are
quite common.

184
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:30,056
Often from stress in the family
environment.

185
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,703
Fukie, let's begin.

186
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,838
Yes.

187
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:51,510
Don't be nervous. Relax.

188
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,447
Shall we try deep breathing?

189
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,823
Look at my hand.

190
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:08,594
Keep looking at my hand
while you listen to me.

191
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,363
Yes.

192
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,864
No need to say anything.

193
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:14,400
Respond in your mind.

194
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,271
Relax.

195
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:28,114
Now, Fukie, imagine that you are
floating on a wide, wide ocean.

196
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:33,419
Your body is sinking into the ocean.

197
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,524
But your breathing isn't difficult at all.

198
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:43,262
In fact it's just as easy as now.

199
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:48,401
You're sinking deeper and deeper.

200
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:52,805
Until you approach the deep ocean floor.

201
00:27:53,906 --> 00:28:01,313
Your memory too is going back to
your early childhood.

202
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,483
How old are you now?

203
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:11,357
Five... years... old.

204
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:16,162
Five. What can you see?

205
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,933
A sandy beach.

206
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:25,738
What are you doing on the beach?

207
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:31,644
Swimming... with mom and dad.

208
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,780
Right, swimming.

209
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,884
It's fun.

210
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,125
Now let's go back to when you
were even younger.

211
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:51,564
You're inside your mom's belly.

212
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:55,067
What can you see?

213
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:12,118
What's wrong? Relax...

214
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,389
Calm down...

215
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,158
Calm down!

216
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,762
Fukie, it's alright now.

217
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:27,767
Fukie! Fukie!

218
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,009
Why didn't you give birth to me?

219
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,057
Yokota-san, please come in.

220
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,661
Yes.

221
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,299
The new test results are back.

222
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,868
Can you see this?

223
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:07,406
Next to Fukie's uterus.

224
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:12,044
It's probably some kind of cystoma.

225
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:13,279
A cystoma?

226
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,815
It's a very rare condition.

227
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:20,553
There were twin fetuses
in the mother's body.

228
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:24,323
For some reason, one twin absorbs
the other and grows.

229
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:29,795
The other one remains
as a cystoma inside its twin.

230
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,565
In other words, twin sisters...

231
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:36,435
Born in the one body.

232
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,305
Inside Fukie?

233
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:45,377
It's thought that the born twin, Fukie...

234
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:51,851
Nurtures the unborn twin inside her.

235
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,897
Sis.

236
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,068
What is it?

237
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:48,540
I need to talk to you about something.

238
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:52,611
Is it about Fukie?

239
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:08,727
YOKOTA

240
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,710
Have you seen Ma?

241
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:30,816
My little Ma? He's dark and cute. No?

242
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,519
No.

243
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,665
Can't find him anywhere.

244
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,738
I'll look elsewhere.

245
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:20,199
Ayano. it's Yokota.

246
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:25,237
Ayano! Ayano!

247
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,496
Ayano.

248
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:59,138
What's wrong? Why didn't you
call in sick?

249
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,455
I'm coming in.

250
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,099
Have you seen a doctor?

251
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,401
You don't look good at all.

252
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:36,742
Can I turn on the light?

253
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,863
Ayano!

254
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,536
Stop it!

255
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:24,389
You'll kill a woman with this hand.

256
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:46,918
MARIKO

257
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,962
Can you feel anything?

258
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,465
Not from a video.

259
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,503
What does the doctor say?

260
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:09,040
A cystoma in her stomach.

261
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:14,713
A medical specialist is treating her.

262
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,149
I don't see how I can help.

263
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:20,252
But she's not getting any better.

264
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:22,788
I feel so sorry for Fukie.

265
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,724
I understand, but...

266
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:29,394
The cystoma in poor Fukie.

267
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:33,432
It's her unborn little sister.

268
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,303
It's probably cursed.

269
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,508
You're the only one who can heal her!

270
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:48,046
I beg you. Use your powers!

271
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,219
Mom, can I go play at Ken's house?

272
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:57,289
Takashi, where are your manners?

273
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:02,461
How old is he?

274
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,230
He'll start elementary in the spring.

275
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:14,172
I'll help.

276
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:29,521
You won't get the elevator?

277
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:31,957
No. it's an enclosed space.

278
00:41:58,183 --> 00:41:59,951
Mariko!

279
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,359
Are you alright?

280
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,265
Thank you. We're fine.

281
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,173
Who's she?

282
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,910
She's the nurse taking care of Fukie.

283
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,479
Really.

284
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:35,520
I'm sorry, Kiwako,
but I can't do it today.

285
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,556
I'll come back another time.

286
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,758
Don't say that!

287
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:43,562
It's impossible today.

288
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,797
I'll come back in 3 days.

289
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,168
OK.

290
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,138
But promise you'll come back.

291
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,241
I promise.

292
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:28,993
Let's begin.

293
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,300
Quiet! it'll come to you.

294
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,000
It's finished.

295
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:03,041
There was another spirit...

296
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:06,577
Living inside Fukie.

297
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:15,219
As you said, probably the cursed
spirit of the unborn child.

298
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:29,067
You must hold the proper rites for her.

299
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:43,781
Mariko!

300
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,953
Thank you.

301
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:52,890
See you, Kiwako.

302
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,063
Hello?

303
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,271
I'll be over soon. Wait for me.

304
00:50:41,606 --> 00:50:45,209
Who is this? Fukie?

305
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:57,748
Fukie?

306
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:25,409
No.

307
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,646
You're not Fukie.

308
00:52:34,886 --> 00:52:36,821
You've switched!

309
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:41,392
You tricked me into casting out Fukie!

310
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,751
Run!

311
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:46,057
KIWAKO

312
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:12,883
Fukie.

313
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:52,657
Kiwako.

314
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:54,992
I'm sorry.

315
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,131
I know what's going on.

316
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:38,769
You hate us, don't you?

317
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:42,773
You begrudge me for not giving
birth to you.

318
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:49,780
Let's end it now.

319
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:02,286
Little Ma!

320
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:07,324
