1
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,049
Report to Holy Master,

2
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,386
the Government is allied with the
Dutch Navy. They come to attack us.

3
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,054
Treat them the bomb.

4
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,024
How dare you!

5
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,701
Asia the Invincible
gathered 30,000 soldiers.

6
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,172
They are ready to fight to the North.

7
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:18,038
It seems that,
he is planning to rebel.

8
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,047
'To unite the world of martial arts.'

9
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,119
'Long life to the Sun moon Sect.'

10
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:33,089
Long life to our Holy Master,
Asia the Invincible.

11
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,185
Holy Master,

12
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,797
Wu is leading some swordsmen
to the Black Cliff.

13
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,991
They are approaching the palace.

14
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,695
They can do nothing to me!

15
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:45,930
They are here.

16
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,769
Kill Asia the Invincible.

17
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,738
Wu.

18
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,089
They killing Hook.

19
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,394
Watch my needles.

20
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,448
Ling!

21
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,556
Essence absorbing stance!

22
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,121
- I won't give you any shelter.
- Watch my Wonder Swords.

23
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,891
Who will you save first?

24
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,308
Asia the Invincible.

25
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,401
I will never tell you.

26
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,744
I want you to remember me
and regret for your whole life.

27
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,915
"Ming Dynasty, Wan Li Year 33"

28
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,461
That's the flag of
Asia the Invincible.

29
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,367
In the past,

30
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,732
The demon and his army
were destroyed here.

31
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:50,181
Yes, how can you imagine that
after his death,

32
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,811
the Black Cliff is still full of
arrogant and haunted atmosphere.

33
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,294
I can feel...
Asia the Invincible hasn't died.

34
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,124
This must be the Black Cliff.

35
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,759
Right, according to the report
of the Chinese officers,

36
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,738
This sailing route is leading
to the Black Cliff.

37
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,403
Officer Koo, isn't it
the base of Asia the Invincible?

38
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,077
General Golida,

39
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,042
Asia the Invincible
sank the Dutch warship...

40
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,084
right here?

41
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,379
Is Asia the Invincible
that horrible...

42
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,683
as you have mentioned?

43
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,519
The world of Han's martial arts
is hard to predict and understand.

44
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,117
There are many rumors in the world,
no matter they are true or not.

45
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,229
I do want to learn about it.

46
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,278
Brother Koo, we are ordered
to lead the Spanish here,

47
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,720
The purpose is to find the goods
from the sunken Dutch ship.

48
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,856
Why should we go up
to the Black Cliff?

49
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,395
I think Golida's intention is not
only the stuff from the sunken ship.

50
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,228
What are they doing?

51
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,970
They are having a sacrifice.

52
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,439
I believe they're scared of the evil
and would like to drive it away.

53
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,304
If they are so scared,
why do they still insist to go up?

54
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,903
Yes, should we ask them why?

55
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,712
Golida said he was curious
about the Black Cliff.

56
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,282
In fact, me too.

57
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,150
Asia the Invincible was a name
of astonishment in the past.

58
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:43,154
Here, the Black Cliff, is his base.

59
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,028
Curious? What made you curious?

60
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,092
- Chin, Ling.
- Yes Sir.

61
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,735
You stay behind, I am going up first.

62
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,604
Woo, he can fly!

63
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,179
This is some sort of kung-fu
in our world of martial arts.

64
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,441
What is the world of martial arts?

65
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,813
It isn't a name of a place.

66
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,079
We called the place where swordsmen
gather the "World of Martial Arts."

67
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,985
So what is the place
where swordsmen gather?

68
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:16,090
Well, the place where
swordsmen live...

69
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,154
That's the place where
the swordsmen living around.

70
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,562
We just call it
the world of martial arts.

71
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,531
We are far behind, let's go.

72
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,001
Do you understand
what he has mentioned?

73
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,335
You are good at Han's dialects.
Don't you understand?

74
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,101
Sure I do.

75
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,735
Okay, let's go to
the world of martial arts.

76
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:50,189
The Notorious Evil:
Asia the Invincible.

77
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,320
Wu!

78
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:53,859
Who?

79
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,579
Asia the Invincible, if your soul
wants to see me, come out.

80
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,654
But you are already dead.

81
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,493
Why should you mention
the history again?

82
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,437
Stay calm,
there is something strange.

83
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,211
This is a land of souls
and evil spirits.

84
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,748
It's not wise of the living people
to visit here. You'd better leave.

85
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,842
Who are you? Human or devil?

86
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,978
Don't get mad, don't shoot.

87
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:36,231
The Black Cliff hasn't been
so busy for a long time.

88
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,567
I am the warden of this Holy Altar
for 3 generations.

89
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:44,200
I have seen the ups and downs
of the masters.

90
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,575
Asia the Invincible
misleader our Sect,

91
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,138
death is his only end!

92
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,984
You mean Asia Invincible is dead?

93
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,954
What? Hasn't he died?

94
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,488
Don't be afraid.

95
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,954
Impossible!

96
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,756
His corpse fell down
to the cliff together...

97
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,761
with his powerful kung-fu.

98
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,794
Just over there.

99
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,367
Would you take me there?

100
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,975
Go.

101
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,093
This is the grave of
Asia the Invincible.

102
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,325
Asia the Invincible.

103
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,769
Asia the Invincible!

104
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,348
Thank God,
this demon is locked right here.

105
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,541
I can't totally believe
that he is dead,

106
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,141
Why?

107
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,115
The only way to prove
he is dead or not,

108
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,656
I to look at his corpse.

109
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,456
Brother Koo,
do you want to dig his grave?

110
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,528
Maybe there is nothing inside.

111
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,729
Let me do it.

112
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,805
General Golida.

113
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,521
Iook at the corpse,

114
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,256
these are what left
by the notorious demon.

115
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:50,631
What he has left the world
is a notorious name.

116
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:54,263
The Notorious Demon:
Asia the Invincible.

117
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,242
What are you looking for?

118
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,747
I've spent great effort,

119
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,373
come here from afar,
only for one thing.

120
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,212
Don't stop me.

121
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,250
What are you searching?

122
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,184
His Sacred Scroll

123
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,788
If this is his dead body

124
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,414
I've heard that his mysterious
kung-fu came from the Sacred Scroll.

125
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,119
General Golida,

126
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,422
I am ordered to take you here
for the sunken ship.

127
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,062
But not for the Sacred Scroll.

128
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,334
You fool!
If I didn't use this excuse,

129
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,373
Your Majesty wouldn't
have been deceived.

130
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,304
And you wouldn't
have taken me here...

131
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,933
to find the thing I wanted

132
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,904
Koo.

133
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,693
You got mysterious Kung-fu,
I got science.

134
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,625
Aisa the Invincible is a legend.

135
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,095
Now, he was buried underground.

136
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,334
We Hans have a saying,
"Respect the Heroes".

137
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,300
Even you don't respect him,

138
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,304
you'd give him some face.

139
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,806
You can't insult his skeleton.

140
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,778
We sail for treasure
is the funniest thing.

141
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,311
You can't even explain clearly
what the world of martial arts is!

142
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,178
If I can't get the Sacred Scroll,
it will be with you.

143
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,375
Golida,

144
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,577
if I let you touch the body
of Asia the Invincible,

145
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,315
Koo will have
a notorious name forever.

146
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,517
Get lost.

147
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,701
You have science,
I have mysterious Kung-fu.

148
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,071
You do despise the warden
of the Sun Moon Sect!

149
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,244
Take it back!

150
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,879
Follow me.

151
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,954
Let's go for Koo.

152
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,222
Thank you for saving my life.

153
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:03,290
A courtier tried hard
to protect a grave.

154
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,161
You are appreciated.

155
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:13,137
- Wine can stop pain.
- Thank you!

156
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,849
Not many people in the world
appreciate good win.

157
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,216
But I won't believe your identity.

158
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,819
Because I can tell,
you are Asia the Invincible.

159
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,055
What made you suspect me
to be Asia the Invincible?

160
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,588
I know pretty well about
the history of the Sun Moon Sect.

161
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,892
Since you are the warden,
and you have great power,

162
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,797
Asia the Invincible and Wu had
many severe fights among themselves.

163
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,392
They won't allow you,
such a guy to stay in his Sect.

164
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,698
Besides,
you're so skilled in kung-fu.

165
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,272
Why you are not renowned?

166
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,370
So, Asia the Invincible
is still alive.

167
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,140
You are Asia the Invincible!

168
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,836
If I were Asia the Invincible,

169
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,743
then you would not leave here alive.

170
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,143
I won't mind being killed,

171
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,046
that's my wish!

172
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,154
Don't you feel regret
to see Asia the Invincible?

173
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,722
Why should I regret
if my wish come true.

174
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,092
Okay, I will make
your wish come true.

175
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,311
Koo, 14 of your valves
has been closed by me,

176
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,937
you're dying.

177
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,684
Just because I have found out
you're Asia the Invincible?

178
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,118
That's what I presumed.

179
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,382
Asia the Invincible,
since you want to kill me.

180
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,584
You should keep your promise.

181
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,892
Let me see your real face.

182
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,328
Does if worth?

183
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,331
It's the fact, why do you
still ask this silly question?

184
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,166
Fine!

185
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:59,179
Koo, does it worth
dying for a glance of me?

186
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,418
Sure!

187
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,983
- Your are the big fool of the world!
- Wait!

188
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,917
Are you scared?

189
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,153
Don't you think no one knows...

190
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,523
you are hiding at the Black Cliff?

191
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:11,618
Do you know how many
Asia the Invincible...

192
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,425
are there in the world?

193
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,099
Although you hide yourself,

194
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,260
there're still many
Asia the Invincible.

195
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,170
Bull shit!

196
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,035
You close my valves, because
you don't want me to die so quickly!

197
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,739
You cunning guy, I want you
to feed the fishes with your body.

198
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,905
Are there many fake
Asia the Invincible?

199
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,999
Right, after you missing,

200
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,907
Many people tried to rule
over the world in the name of you.

201
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,707
Although you feel regret
under the Black Cliff,

202
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,017
Many Asia the Invincible
are still fighting for power.

203
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,779
You didn't kill, but many
innocent people died because of you.

204
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:19,389
What a troubled world.

205
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,806
Koo, since my name
is still a disaster.

206
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,375
Take me to stop the
fake Asia the Invincible.

207
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,550
I can do that,
but you must promise me.

208
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,654
Never kill again.

209
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,395
Good!

210
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,701
If you disclose my identity,

211
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,432
I'll kill not only
the innocent people, but you too.

212
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,337
Let's go for the
fake Asia the Invincible.

213
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,122
A ship is coming!

214
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,663
Be alert!

215
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,699
Be alert!

216
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,107
Report to our Holy Master.

217
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,938
We've discover that
a ship is approaching us.

218
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:09,337
Mo Yan Lu Chong.
Are your goods ready?

219
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,442
I have brought you the gold.

220
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,109
30000 guns, 100 cannons,

221
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,808
8000 baskets of gunpowder.

222
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,576
Our ship is dangerous under the sun.

223
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,416
If not cool it with water.

224
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,957
Our ship will explode any time.

225
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,787
Mo Yan Lu Chong,

226
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,886
you know sound transmission too.

227
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,828
But you are exaggerating.

228
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:37,129
How can you cool
such a big ship with water?

229
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,793
Asia the Invincible, but you are
more exaggerating than me.

230
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,064
My ship left Japan 8 years ago.

231
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,439
But I am always well informed

232
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,171
According to the report of my ninjas.

233
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,710
Asia the invincible died
4 months ago...

234
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,579
at the Black Cliff.

235
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:53,742
If this is the fact,

236
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,717
you are not Asia the Invincible.

237
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,578
It's lousy trick!

238
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,882
The Japanese ninja!

239
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,134
How can you fool me?

240
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,605
Raise.

241
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,410
I, Mo Yan Lo Chong is coming.

242
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,514
I will let your fellows
to fight with you.

243
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,623
Watch my sword!

244
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,962
- Come here.
- Master!

245
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,461
Try my Iron Balls.

246
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,227
Watch out!

247
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,446
A Japanese ninja is nothing special.

248
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,156
I sank down into the sea.

249
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,445
Turn to the East,
get ready the cannon.

250
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,951
Fire!

251
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,926
Dai, I want you tonight.

252
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:51,447
The opium is the tribute
from Ryukyu Islands.

253
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:56,113
Such precious thing should be
shared with our Holy Master.

254
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,173
Holy Master.

255
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,001
I haven't slept with you since
you've been my concubine,

256
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,542
do you know why?

257
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,338
I don't know.

258
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:27,968
I suspect that you are a man.

259
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,150
Iook, he is the betrayer!

260
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,549
The Japanese ninja...

261
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,516
is really great!

262
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,236
When did you find out I am a ninja?

263
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,429
Because when you looked at me.

264
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,597
Your eyes are different
from other concubines.

265
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,065
But why don't you
take action earlier?

266
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,372
I want you to tell me
how to trace Mo Yan Lu Chong.

267
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:48,886
Pigeon!

268
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,325
I need this to find Mo Yan Lu Chong.

269
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,964
What are you crying?

270
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,301
The one you loved
is right in front of you.

271
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:10,376
But, how about my lover?
Where are you?

272
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,297
Koo, you are quite good at flying.

273
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,664
You are still capable
to follow me after an hour.

274
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,031
But still I can't get ahead of you.

275
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,034
Do you want to?

276
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:06,696
The universe is endless,
the stars are bright.

277
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:12,710
The sun rises from the East,
I an the Invincible!

278
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:18,243
The universe is endless,
the stars are bright.

279
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:24,412
The sun rises from the East,
I an the Invincible!

280
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:27,320
Our Holy Master, Asia the Invincible.

281
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,791
Our Holy Master, Asia the Invincible.

282
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,260
Please honor me
the light of thousand generations.

283
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,897
Please honor me
the light of thousand generations.

284
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,626
Asia the Invincible
is just a normal guy.

285
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,339
Somehow he is worshipped as God.

286
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,408
People do not really understand
Asia the Invincible.

287
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,045
They don't need to understand
Asia the Invincible.

288
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,149
They only want...

289
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:57,847
Asia the Invincible, our Holy Master.

290
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,585
Burn me to death!

291
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:05,160
I am willing to die for you!
Hurry up.

292
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,130
Oh, Blood Sacrifice.

293
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,563
Hurry up!

294
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,368
Who are you? Why are you here?

295
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,272
What you are worshipping,

296
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,868
Is in fact the origin of evils.

297
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,274
Do you know it?
Why do you worship him?

298
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,085
Who are you?

299
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,915
You can't insult our Holy Master.

300
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,511
Holy Master?

301
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:37,417
You abuse the name of Asia the
Invincible to fool these Highlanders.

302
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,291
Do you want to offend him?

303
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,465
I an designated by
Asia the Invincible!

304
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,003
I rule over them according
to the will of Asia the Invincible.

305
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,731
Bull shit!

306
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,205
You haven't seen the
real Asia the Invincible.

307
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,536
You will be punished.

308
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,271
Only me who can communicate
with Asia the Invincible.

309
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:58,008
If you insult me, you are
insulting Asia the invincible.

310
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,344
Do you know who I am?

311
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,747
Tell me, who are you?

312
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,285
Who exactly are you?

313
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,419
How dare you talk to me like that!

314
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:14,093
Our Holy Master, Asia the Invincible!

315
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,065
What power has Asia the Invincible
evincible given you?

316
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,668
There are continuous
disasters in Highland.

317
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,363
The government is oppressing us.

318
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,804
Only Asia the Invincible
can protect us.

319
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:28,708
Foolish! I will kill those
who keep on worshipping me.

320
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,173
Because I am the real
Asia the Invincible.

321
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,282
Bull shit!

322
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,283
You believe the fake one
but not the true one.

323
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,859
Now you should
believe in what I said?

324
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,195
We can't surrender, I want to
devote my heart to the Holy Master!

325
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,564
We can't surrender!

326
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,763
If you want to devote your heart,
dig it out now.

327
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,105
No one can affect our love
towards the Holy Master.

328
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,677
Who suspects, who is going
against Asia the Invincible!

329
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,774
Do you see our strength now?

330
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,146
You want Asia the Invincible,

331
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,278
I will give you Asia the Invincible.

332
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,526
Give me your hearts.

333
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,899
Stop murdering!

334
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,905
Asia the Invincible! You promised me
that you wouldn't kill.

335
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,807
What the hell are you? It's the
business of the Highlanders.

336
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,783
There is nothing to do
with the government officials.

337
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,381
I had said, who disclose me,
who should be killed.

338
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,822
It's you who disclose yourself,

339
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,188
not me.

340
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,990
If you want to kill me,
not a reason is needed!

341
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,641
I want the whole world
to hate Asia the Invincible.

342
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,370
I want to slaughter...

343
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,707
those fake Asia the Invincible!!

344
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,729
Is this the logo
of the Sun Moon Sect?

345
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,927
I am the government officials,
who dares cuff me?

346
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,264
Shut up!

347
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,397
Tell me how many government
officials are there?

348
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,772
Tell me, so I will keep you
a complete corpse.

349
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,401
Asia the Invincible?

350
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,155
Another Asia the Invincible.

351
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,754
How dare a little dog tease me?

352
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,884
I want to make your mouth shut,
let's see how you laugh again!

353
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,194
I think you wouldn't mind
somebody tease you.

354
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,726
The real Asia the Invincible
doesn't want to admit his identity.

355
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,397
And you, try every means to claim
yourselves to be Asia the Invincible.

356
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,572
I don't know you real identity.

357
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:48,410
But, the kung-fu of Asia the
Invincible came from the Sacred Scroll.

358
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,140
Show us the Sacred Scroll...

359
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,512
to prove yourself the
real Asia the invincible.

360
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,179
You fat-headed, since there are
so many fake Asia the Invincible.

361
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,378
There will be fake Sacred Scroll!

362
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,919
Let's see how long can you stand.

363
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:08,396
Broken!

364
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,740
- Brother Ko.
- Officer Koo!

365
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,480
You are here!

366
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,342
We were caught
when hiding form the Spanish.

367
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,149
Iook!

368
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,053
- The Navy of Ming Dynasty!
- The arms of our government.

369
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,424
Right!
We bought these from the navy...

370
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,723
who stole the arms from their camps.

371
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,560
That's why it will soon be
the end of your dynasty soon.

372
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,791
I know your warships are coming...

373
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,493
South to go against us.

374
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,865
During our fight.

375
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,336
I will hang you up.

376
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,599
Let's wait and
see your dog face then!

377
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,283
It's useless,
we've tried this before.

378
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,956
This is our chance to survive.

379
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,101
Stay back.

380
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,313
Don't move, once they are in a mess.

381
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,145
The nearby navy camp
will hear the explosion.

382
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,378
At that moment,

383
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,854
we can get rid of all
fake Asia the Invincible.

384
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,725
How smart is your fat-head.

385
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:55,795
Officer, is that your trick?

386
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,500
You want to keep my life not because
you want me to cover you.

387
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,544
Because you want to know where is
the real Asia the Invincible.

388
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,206
You are afraid that
he will show up anytime.

389
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,980
Why did you say
that's the real Asia the Invincible?

390
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,083
It's useless to kill them!

391
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,226
It's not necessary for me
to tell you, he will show up soon.

392
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,730
Don't worry, he will come to you.

393
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,095
You are so anxious
to know he is real or not.

394
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,742
Sure your purpose is to find out
the real Asia the Invincible.

395
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,139
Have you waited him for a long time?

396
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,259
They are not
at the front of the ship.

397
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,820
Report to our Holy Master.

398
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,453
We've searched everywhere, but we
can't locate the sound of the flute.

399
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,397
We can't tell
where the sound comes from.

400
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,306
It's always like he finds others.

401
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,475
No one could find him out.

402
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,452
Here he comes.

403
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,421
It's we who leaded him here,

404
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,488
how can we send him back?

405
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,891
Raise the logo of our Sun Moon Sect.
Greet our honorable guest.

406
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,010
You return finally.

407
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,862
- Snow!
- I can hear you calling my name.

408
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,227
My coming here is not for you.

409
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,561
Then why did you come?

410
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,430
I came here for burying everything.

411
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,338
Forget Asia the Invincible.

412
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,250
The ship ran aground.

413
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,457
Sir, the gate of the prison
is ruined.

414
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,322
Okay, rush out!

415
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,241
Go to the head of the ship now.

416
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,782
To stop Asia the Invincible
destroying this ship again.

417
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,180
Catch it.

418
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,018
Take it back!

419
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,472
Asia the Invincible.

420
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,954
Holy Master.

421
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,724
Koo,

422
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,988
I have killed many
fake Asia the Invincible.

423
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,030
Asia the Invincible,
you are always superior.

424
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,529
But this is your Sun Moon Sect.

425
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,567
Stop another massacre please.

426
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:48,136
Koo, I want you to see how I return
to the world of martial arts.

427
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,605
And I want you to see my massacre
in the world of martial arts.

428
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:56,374
I am wrong. My holy Master

429
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,477
I lead the Sect in the name of you.

430
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,711
Because I am waiting for your return.

431
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:06,823
To let you lead us again,
and establish our own kingdom.

432
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,158
On your knees.

433
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,593
On your knees. Hurry up.

434
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,459
He is the real Asia the Invincible.

435
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:24,704
Snow, let bygones be bygones.

436
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:28,209
Master, I won't
let you leave me again.

437
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,869
I am a notorious demon.

438
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,743
I will go my own way.

439
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,082
Whenever you go, I will follow you.

440
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,117
You want to bother me?

441
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,460
If you want to follow me,
I will break your legs and hands.

442
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,689
Stop.

443
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,832
Just leave,
what do you want to proof?

444
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,803
None of your business.

445
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:18,323
You are my woman indeed.
You don't scare of death!

446
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:23,328
Death is not horrible. Its really
a great pain for one to live alone.

447
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,765
Okay, I will leave you,
the rubbish to be alive.

448
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,665
I want you to be painful forever.

449
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,441
Why do you hurt
the one who cares for you?

450
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,369
I don't need others concern,

451
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,943
what I want is the hatred of yours.

452
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,486
On your knees.
He is the real Asia the Invincible.

453
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,822
The powerful Su Moon Sect.

454
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:51,052
To unite the world.

455
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:55,526
Long life to our Holy Master.

456
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:01,393
Asia the Invincible,
the Sun Moon Sect.

457
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,038
Those who are longing for my return,
I tell you!

458
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,132
History can be changed!

459
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,575
Is Asia the Invincible so horrible!

460
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,186
This disaster will begin
from this ship.

461
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,916
And it will spread over
the whole world of martial arts.

462
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,594
Why do you still trust in
Asia the invincible?

463
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,760
He had abandoned you.

464
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,636
You'd better stop the wandering life.

465
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,071
Why don't you surrender
and join our court?

466
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,113
How ridiculous!
We always rule ourselves.

467
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:47,206
Whom do you think you are? Damn it.

468
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,545
If not for Snow.

469
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,380
Our Holy Master won't abandon us.

470
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:51,317
That's right!

471
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,220
Snow, you deceived us.

472
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,586
You are the sinner of our Sect.

473
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,628
Snow, you sinner!

474
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,354
What else do you want to say?

475
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,727
Speak up!

476
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,526
I have made a deadly sin.

477
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,603
Kill her!

478
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:09,005
Ching, protect Snow.

479
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:10,630
Kill that 3 damn officers too.

480
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,208
Hang them to death and airdried them.

481
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,742
Right, that's a good idea.

482
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,539
Send the 3 damn officers to hell!

483
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,238
Execute the law of our Sect.

484
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,960
Brother Koo, save Snow now.

485
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,756
Stop, you are not capable
to defeat them.

486
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,662
Brother Koo, are we going to
take her along with us?

487
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,095
Cut the crap.

488
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,695
Those who are hurt by
Asia the Invincible,

489
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:12,665
Are all our friends.

490
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,466
We can't defeat them by kung-fu,
let's use the cannon.

491
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,645
If you do so, we will die together.

492
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,944
A part of this ship has been...

493
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,575
destroyed by Asia the Invincible.

494
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,550
If we try to attack each other
by the cannon...

495
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:37,515
the ship will be sunned,
all of us will die.

496
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,422
Brother Koo,
the cannon has no blast wire.

497
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,830
Save your crocodile tears,
this ship can't stay any longer.

498
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,869
As we just want to survive.

499
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,765
Give us Snow, then we'll let you go.

500
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,398
Right, Highlanders are Highlanders,
Hans are Hans.

501
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,840
We're of different world.

502
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,378
Give us Snow, then we'll let you go.

503
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,107
Have you forgotten...

504
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,306
how Snow treated you?

505
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,314
For this sinner.

506
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,918
Don't you think
it's worth dying with us?

507
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,484
Ching, don't let the wind
extinguish the fire.

508
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:10,921
Sir, this ship has run aground,

509
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:15,327
if we delay anymore,
we will be sunk with this ship.

510
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,691
Ling, in such as emergency,

511
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,392
how can you talk like this?

512
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:20,534
What do you mean?

513
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,764
No, I don't want to die like this.

514
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,636
You have internal conflicts
among yourselves.

515
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,538
You are not as united as us.

516
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:33,273
Sir, I don't want to rescuer her.

517
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,850
Please let me go!

518
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,284
To betray us at such critical moment?
You are not my subordinate.

519
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,653
Go now.

520
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,860
Thank you, Sir!

521
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,792
Come and join us.

522
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,643
He knew our drawbacks.

523
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,712
So I have to do so,
please forgive me.

524
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,912
Ching, in order to save an enemy.

525
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,852
We have to kill our man,

526
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,355
What's that are we going
to rescue or kill?

527
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,990
Brother Koo, what's the matter?

528
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,596
Brother Koo. You...

529
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:28,027
I think, your valves are closed
by a supreme kung-fu master.

530
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,403
The blood is flowing backward.

531
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,710
You are seriously hurt,
you are dying!

532
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:40,239
Yes, I am hurt by
Asia the Invincible.

533
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,077
We are dying too.

534
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,122
Since you cannot protect yourself,
why should you save me?

535
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,522
It's me who leaded him here.

536
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:54,262
I have to bear all responsibilities.

537
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,540
When the sun rises from the East.

538
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:15,209
That'll be the end of your life.

539
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,021
That's why...

540
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:21,682
I time the time left.

541
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,758
The noise.

542
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,299
Shit, it's the Spanish warship.

543
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,841
The Spanish warship is approaching.

544
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,806
Where is it?

545
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:44,343
They come for...

546
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,346
Asia the Invincible.

547
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,381
We hand the flag
of our Sun Moon Sect.

548
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:50,910
They will shoot us
once they see the flag!

549
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,819
Don't listen to him,
don't listen to him.

550
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,391
What are you waiting?

551
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,552
Lower the sail.
Face them with the cannon.

552
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,527
You are the courtier of the gov't,
don't cheat me with such trick.

553
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,428
Why should I cheat you?

554
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,762
- Ching, lower the sail.
- Don't move!

555
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,564
Or I will fire you!

556
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,419
Ching, go now.

557
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,419
Ching, it's peaceful around.

558
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,185
Luckily we haven't met
another warship.

559
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,831
Brother Koo,

560
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,025
when will this woman leave us?

561
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,201
Just throw me into the sea.

562
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,906
Brother Koo.

563
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:26,138
Stop helping me.

564
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:33,012
Will you call me dog again?

565
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,857
Unless you take off this dog's clothe,
or you'll be dog forever.

566
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:44,458
Go on insulting me if you feel great.

567
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,704
Hold it.

568
00:51:55,979 --> 00:52:00,143
Stop thinking anything nonsense,
Asia the Invincible will not come back.

569
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,112
I know you must hate him.

570
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,824
I am just worrying about him.

571
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:13,060
He is fooled by fate,
he can't escape.

572
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,030
If I were Asia the Invincible.

573
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,391
I won't leave you.

574
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:37,986
Ching, when will we reach the camps?

575
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,214
According to the speed
of the current.

576
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,348
We can reach the camps after 6 hours.

577
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,903
Wear it, I am Asia the Invincible.

578
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,041
Boss, she sings better than you.

579
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,188
Give way!

580
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,431
Damn you, where do you come from?

581
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,792
Do you want to take
the bread out of our mouths?

582
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,426
Are you the one
who gives order here?

583
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:11,701
You want to challenge me?

584
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:15,436
Not necessary, tonight,
I will listen to you.

585
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:28,849
Where are the pretty girls?

586
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,993
Stop bothering me.

587
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,597
Are your boss looking for me?

588
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,299
I do want it, so what?

589
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,759
You are not qualified to touch me.

590
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,769
Damn it!

591
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,105
Do you think that you are protected,
so you don't even respect me!

592
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,475
I tell you, we wanderers are nasty.

593
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,810
Today, you are the boss,
tomorrow I will be the boss.

594
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:59,681
She is sick, let me serve your boss.

595
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,923
Get up.

596
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,629
Breathless? He is breathless.

597
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,193
Kidding?

598
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,893
Gut up, wake up.

599
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,042
How are you, Master?

600
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,267
How are you, Master?

601
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,269
Mo Yan Lu Choung.

602
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:04,744
Mo Yan Lu Choung.

603
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,850
If you want to take them away,

604
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:11,187
gamble with me.

605
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:14,320
If you win, you may take them away.

606
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:19,531
I think you two
are great kung-fu masters.

607
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:21,603
But, this is such a small bet.

608
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,695
Why not make it bigger?

609
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,004
What?

610
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,577
The winner can take us away,

611
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,312
The bet is too simple.

612
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,912
Why not cut the legs
off from the loser?

613
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,018
You want to add
a pair of legs for gambling?

614
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:43,082
What? Are you scared?

615
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,551
Okay. I won't give it a damn.

616
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,792
Just go ahead.

617
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:03,641
It depends on fate.

618
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:12,178
What do you want to bet?

619
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:14,222
Big or small?

620
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,823
Small!

621
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,364
How about you?

622
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,327
Big!

623
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:27,426
Fine!

624
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,712
No need to open it. I am the winner.

625
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,184
I have to open it.

626
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,229
The dead won't argue with me.

627
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,297
I am still here.

628
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,572
The loser should pay his legs.

629
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,315
Open, 4,5,6. Big.

630
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,181
You lost.

631
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:16,717
Don't offend him.

632
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,286
Cut your legs off.

633
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,753
How dare you!

634
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:22,924
General Mo Yan Lu Chong,
we will follow you.

635
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,186
Please let her go.

636
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,854
She doesn't know the rules.

637
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:30,126
All of you go back,
take her to see me tonight.

638
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,530
Yes.

639
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,700
General...

640
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,839
Mo Yan Lu Chong.

641
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,836
Don't think that
it's an ordinary bet.

642
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:46,040
Some one will come to take your legs.

643
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,312
Go.

644
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,929
I haven't known your name yet.

645
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:08,334
I am the same as you,
we have no names.

646
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,740
The people are heartless
and they claimed me heartless.

647
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,866
I am sorry to drag you down.

648
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:17,780
I should have to thank you.

649
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,075
It's you who let me know that.

650
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,784
It's painful to be
an ordinary people.

651
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:29,750
Who are you?

652
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,666
Me?

653
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,636
About the answer of it...
I do want to know too

654
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,716
Help yourself!

655
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,777
Mo Yan Lu Chong, long time no see.

656
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,678
Asia the Invincible, here you are.

657
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,950
After you had visited
the Black Cliff 3 years ago.

658
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,748
I wrote to Japan
to check which generation...

659
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,414
you are of the
Mo Yan Lu Chong Family.

660
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,685
Asia the Invincible,
you are very smart.

661
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:46,591
Oh! How come?

662
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,034
I had told you...

663
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,105
that someone would
come for your legs.

664
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,573
You've known my background already.

665
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:58,812
Right! Because all the troops of the
real Mo Yan Lu Chong were destroyed.

666
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,075
Since the 4th generation of...

667
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,741
Mo Yan Lu Chong Family has been
taken over by Liu Seng already.

668
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,375
Watch my Mo Yan Sword.

669
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,150
Cut!

670
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,151
Ninja Disappearance!

671
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,397
- It's your real face.
- Thunder Bomb!

672
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:27,740
Ninjas come out!

673
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,141
Poison liquid.

674
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,910
You're also a great Kung-fu master.

675
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:37,212
Why do you pretend
to be Mo Yan Lu Chong?

676
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:41,545
What a pity! Actually,
you are a miserable as I do.

677
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,352
You dare not show others
your real face.

678
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,857
Sir, are you alright?

679
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,693
I'm fine, go out.

680
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,732
Yes.

681
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:00,935
"Commander of Ming Dynasty Navy"

682
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,043
Why there isn't any guard?

683
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,413
Go in and take a look!

684
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:17,187
I've caught it, I've caught it!
It is still yelling!

685
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,863
Here comes Officer Koo.

686
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,131
Where is Officer Tin?

687
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,027
Officer Tin? He hasn't waken up yet.

688
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,863
Still haven't got up
to inspect the military affairs yet.

689
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,334
Being navy officers of Ming Dynasty,
all of you are badly disciplined.

690
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,408
You come here to settle the riot.

691
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:36,478
You are such a mess.
How can you fight with the enemas?

692
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,171
Keep on insulting.

693
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:45,453
I don't mind giving a lecture
to your damn soldiers.

694
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,124
How would you tackle
your foes when they come?

695
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,117
Yes Sir.

696
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,961
Greet. It's great!

697
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,360
- Brother Koo.
- Brother Kai Wan.

698
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,696
Brother Koo.

699
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,467
Your camp is loosely guarded,

700
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,268
don't you afraid of
any attack from the foes?

701
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,409
How come! There are so many foes.

702
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,973
All of us just want to live.

703
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,606
Not many people like fighting.

704
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:31,959
Brother Kai Wan.

705
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,598
May I know your good name?

706
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,034
Get us 2 jars of Kaoliang, hurry up.

707
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:45,773
Coming, don't be in such a hurry.
Making you drunk.

708
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,679
Get us the main course.

709
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,923
Get me some more wine.

710
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,721
There are many advantages
of being a soldier.

711
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,027
When you hunt, you will get
supply of guns from the Court.

712
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:12,165
There are chefs from the Court
who take care of our meals.

713
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,805
I treasure my fortune,

714
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:19,005
so I enjoy sharing nice things
with my bosom friends.

715
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,979
Come, have a cup of wine with us.

716
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:25,481
Brother Kai Wan.

717
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:28,954
You bastard.

718
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,749
How adore you scold me?

719
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:38,928
General...

720
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,896
There is something wrong
in the Western yard.

721
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,201
- What's happening?
- No information right now.

722
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,436
- Assembly!
- General!

723
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:51,176
General.
Here comes Asia the Invincible.

724
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,441
All our soldiers have been injured.

725
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:54,707
General, Asia the Invincible
is so cruel that,

726
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,978
the soldiers of our two battalions
were seriously injured.

727
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:58,711
So powerful? Let me handle him.

728
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,219
- The force of Battalion 7 follow me.
- Yes, Sir.

729
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:08,355
It is the one in red.

730
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,591
I want to compete with you.

731
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,463
Move faster. Protect His Excellency.

732
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,400
Protect His Excellency.

733
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:19,936
Brother Koo.

734
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:25,608
Chin, if something
happened unexpectedly, .

735
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:28,481
You would have to leave here at once.

736
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:51,169
Brother Kai wan.

737
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,437
Officer Koo,
which part you've got hurt?

738
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,511
Brother Kai Wan, cheer up...

739
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,306
Brother Kai Wan...

740
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:14,561
It's funny. It's really very funny.

741
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,025
Our camp is the most happiest one.

742
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,533
We haven't enjoyed
such a game for a long time.

743
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:24,402
It's rare for us having visitors.

744
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:27,271
Brother Koo, it's a funny game.

745
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:28,968
I'm afraid that you have never
got such a chance to play.

746
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:32,639
Brother Koo, don't you believe
there is Asia the Invincible?

747
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,182
Of course, there is an
Asia the Invincible.

748
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:37,046
Call our Asia the Invincible out.

749
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:38,620
Asia the Invincible...

750
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,984
Asia the Invincible?

751
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:52,295
See, our Asia the Invincible
is not so bad.

752
01:07:55,604 --> 01:08:00,166
Officer Tin and all officers!

753
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,641
Asia the Invincible,

754
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:05,072
the most prominent among
the brothels of the 13 provinces.

755
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,046
They're all bought by me.

756
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:11,245
Asia the Invincible is just a name.

757
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,684
I can call myself
Asia the Invincible too.

758
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:14,847
Come on, call one.

759
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:18,950
Versatility, a full unity
of the world of martial arts.

760
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,689
Hurrah, General Tin!

761
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,526
Sing a song, with bureaucratic tone

762
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:32,438
"Versatility, a full unity
of the world of martial arts,"

763
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,941
"Asia the Invincible."

764
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:48,287
"Hurrah! Hurrah, General Tin!"

765
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,557
Sing like this, then I will leave
a good reputation for generations

766
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:58,063
I also know the Kung-fu of
Asia the Invincible's flying needles.

767
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,759
Let me show you.

768
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,634
Bingo!

769
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,498
Good! I'm great!

770
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,879
- Snow!
- What?

771
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:15,979
Tin.

772
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,286
I just want to check her wound.

773
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:19,915
She is my woman.

774
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:28,453
I won't let anyone touch her.

775
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:36,195
Yes, it's not decent
to fool other's wife.

776
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,765
She is seriously hurt.

777
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:41,740
Here is not a good place,

778
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,369
you had better
take a rest in my camp.

779
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,176
It's not convenient for us
to stay in the camp with you.

780
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:48,611
Not easy?

781
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:51,185
Let me go out,
so you can sleep with her.

782
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,386
- Man!
- Yes.

783
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:57,091
- Take these two guests for a rest.
- Yes.

784
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:59,192
It seems to me that
I can only sleep...

785
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:02,093
with my Asia the invincible tonight.

786
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,606
Am I your woman?

787
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,293
Light more!

788
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,231
It's funny!

789
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:47,809
How wonderful is it.

790
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:49,968
Give me the wine.

791
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,938
Oh shit! Asia the Invincible?

792
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,643
Versatility, a full unity
of the world of Martial Arts!

793
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,912
Unbeaten! General Tin!

794
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:19,891
Brother Koo.

795
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:35,277
Brother Kai Wan, something a
gentleman should do but something not.

796
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:41,385
We should not argue for a woman!

797
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:45,152
We can do nothing
once get involved in a war.

798
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:51,064
Koo, you said I was your woman.

799
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:54,997
Now, how can you settle it?

800
01:12:56,605 --> 01:13:01,508
Well... Take care of yourself.

801
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,856
He asked me to take care of myself.

802
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:20,752
We'll, let's take care.
Go to the camp now.

803
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,303
Okay.

804
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,072
But I've to dress up as
Asia the Invincible first.

805
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,272
You want to be Asia the Invincible?
Good!

806
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,101
I've stop your valve remotely.

807
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:05,337
I don't want you to pretend
to Asia the invincible anymore,

808
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,840
so I must take you away.

809
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,074
You lie down so quickly!
My dear Asia the Invincible!

810
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,492
Bingo!

811
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:35,098
Dismiss!

812
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:37,229
- Bingo!
- Dismiss.

813
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:38,431
Bingo!

814
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,470
Shit! You're touched
my laughing valve!

815
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:46,773
Watch out!

816
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:53,747
Go away!

817
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:55,847
Can't you see that I am
playing games with General Tin?

818
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:03,321
Help me.

819
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:14,533
Dismiss!

820
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:17,637
Bingo!

821
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,748
Your laughing valve
is attacked again.

822
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:34,157
Brother Tin, Brother Tin, hold on.

823
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:39,758
It's nonsense,
let's play something else.

824
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:43,271
You listen,
we'll play something else.

825
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,635
We'll rehearse the declaration of
war on Asia the Invincible tomorrow.

826
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,707
But you'd better call me
Asia the Invincible now.

827
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,074
Versatility, a full unity of
the world of Martial Arts! Come on!

828
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,015
Versatility, a full unity of
the world of Martial Arts!

829
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:58,052
Unbeaten! Asia the Invincible!

830
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:02,453
Officer Koo, Hurrah! Hurrah!

831
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:05,422
Versatility, a full unity of
the world of Martial Arts.

832
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,325
Unbeaten! Asia the Invincible!

833
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,864
Officer Koo, Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

834
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,997
We can't escape from the war.

835
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,072
Even we're going to die. I want to
die by the side of Asia the Invincible.

836
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:26,906
Thank you for let me go.

837
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,510
Snow, you go and look for
Asia the Invincible now.

838
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,318
But, I don't want to
see you again in the battlefield.

839
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:55,769
What's the matter?

840
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,310
Chin, are you crazy?

841
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,545
I don't want you to become
another Asia the invincible.

842
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,547
When I am lonely.

843
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,288
I hope a fried to accompany me.

844
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:13,153
We can get him back to Black Cliff.

845
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,855
Then we should
find ways to defeat her.

846
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:39,809
The Spanish, are you still
looking for the Sacred Scroll?

847
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:42,084
Who are you?

848
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,953
Do you know
where's the Sacred Scroll?

849
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:46,687
You've asked the correct person!
I am Asia the Invincible.

850
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:47,954
Asia the Invincible?

851
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:16,724
You are powerful because of this?

852
01:18:16,825 --> 01:18:18,986
Your science. Is shit.

853
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,163
Armour?

854
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,132
What power did your God give you?

855
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:34,700
This is our holy cup.

856
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:40,313
Your God is useless!

857
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,748
Kneel down!

858
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,949
Your Bible should be re-written.

859
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,387
From now on.

860
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:51,050
The God mentioned
in your western Bible...

861
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,627
Should be re-written
as Asia the Invincible.

862
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,496
Come on, let's in prayer.

863
01:18:56,631 --> 01:19:02,763
Holy Asia the Invincible,
Holy Asia the Invincible.

864
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:20,181
Hand the flag of the
Sun Moon Sect at the bow.

865
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:22,882
- Keep on temping Asia the Invincible.
- Yes, Sir!

866
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:25,853
Anything special?

867
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,159
Nothing.

868
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,961
General Mo Yan Lu Chong, Liu Seng

869
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,165
And all other Japanese ninjas.

870
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,401
We are get ready to fight.

871
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:44,210
Let's go!

872
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:55,022
Today, I want to show you something,

873
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:57,625
which you've never seen before,
that's my real face.

874
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,256
Look!

875
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,104
Are you surprised?

876
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:13,174
Can you imagine the
invincible General Mo Yan Lu Chong,

877
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:15,971
is a hooker in the camp
of the wanderers?

878
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,214
You must be having some bad feeling.

879
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,246
Since you have been
deceived for a long time.

880
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:28,019
You don't know...

881
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:30,284
who is the master behind.

882
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:31,723
Let me tell you.

883
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,694
The real name of Mo Yan Lu Chong
is Asia the Invincible.

884
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:41,628
I have got the military order.

885
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:43,499
Who goes against me should be killed.

886
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,007
Attention.

887
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:50,634
Let's go ahead.
We'll join with the Spanish warship...

888
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:51,871
to unite the world.

889
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,778
Since the people can't forget me.

890
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:59,186
I'll lead the troops
to declare war again.

891
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,312
I will change my name to
"Asia and Europe the Invincible".

892
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,353
- Raise the banner.
- Yes!

893
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:11,388
"Asia and Europe the invincible"

894
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,695
Sir, a warship is found ahead.

895
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:16,397
This is the Mo Yan
warship of the Japanese.

896
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:21,805
Sir,

897
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,172
the Japanese and the Spanish warship

898
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,711
raised their banners.

899
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:26,337
They declare war on us.

900
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,383
What?

901
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:35,679
It's strange, why do the
Japanese and the Spanish...

902
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,485
declare war on us?

903
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,458
Raise our flag and declare war.

904
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:44,632
"Koo"

905
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:48,094
Fire.

906
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:53,501
Report, Koo's banner is hanging on
the warship of Ming Dynasty.

907
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:56,236
Fire to them to show our trench!
Declare war now.

908
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:57,902
Koo's banner.

909
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,282
It's Koo!

910
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,886
Instruct the Spanish warship
to attack the warship of Ming Dynasty.

911
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,994
- Check the ship!
- Yes!

912
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:39,711
Koo, you are great!

913
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:42,218
Fine, let's sink into the water.

914
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:05,608
Sir,

915
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:08,238
the Japanese ship
disappears suddenly.

916
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,679
It's a submarine.

917
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:15,722
Bet there is much undercurrent here.

918
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:18,850
If they sail below the sea,

919
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,053
their route will be hindered.

920
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,860
That's what I want.

921
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:28,865
Pour the paint into the water
to disturb their view.

922
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,904
Yes. Execute now!

923
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:46,153
Sir, our route is hindered
by the submerged rocks.

924
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:47,812
The Ming Dynasty Navy
poured the paints into the sea.

925
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:50,516
Visibility is poor, we can't move.

926
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,059
You want to trap us
at the bottom of the sea?

927
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:58,826
Fine, bomb the submerged rocks
with the mine.

928
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,127
Yes.

929
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:07,469
Report, the Spanish warship
is approaching us in full speed.

930
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:10,408
It seems that they want to crash
against us, please give instruction.

931
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:13,771
- Lower the sail.
- Lower the sail in full speed.

932
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,213
Yes!

933
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:17,680
Lower the sail.

934
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,856
Get ready the war.

935
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:24,174
Koo, you have been
exhausted in the fighting.

936
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:27,186
Asia the Invincible
hasn't shown up yet.

937
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:32,391
Chin, I tell you.

938
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:35,724
The wish of everybody,

939
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:39,459
is to meet the strongest enemy
before his death.

940
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:45,737
If he were the leader of the enemy.

941
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,209
It's too early to say
who'll be the winner.

942
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:57,142
Report,
the body of the ship is damaged.

943
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:58,685
We'd emerge from the sea at once.

944
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:00,651
Koo must be waiting for me.

945
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:02,518
Well, let's go up.

946
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:07,051
Asia the Invincible!

947
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:19,072
Focus the top of their sail.

948
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,768
Asia the Invincible,
you show up eventually.

949
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,100
Get ready the cannon!

950
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,012
Asia the Invincible?

951
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:30,740
But you are not better than me
at leading the troops.

952
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:34,582
You've got the magic power
from "Sacred Scroll".

953
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,486
Although this is
your personal achievement,

954
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,456
it can't make you
achieve great success.

955
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:43,161
That's why your troops didn't attack,

956
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:45,289
but were destroyed
at the Black Cliff.

957
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,424
Bull shit!

958
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:49,594
My failure was caused
by my foe whom I admired.

959
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:51,739
I didn't want to hurt him,

960
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:54,364
thus I pretended that
I was kill Dundee the cliff.

961
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:58,370
Last time, you could escape
because of the "Sacred Scroll".

962
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:00,611
Now, the history is repeated.

963
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:03,616
If you had not had the luck
to adopt the "Sacred Scroll",

964
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:06,551
you'd not have escaped
from my attack.

965
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:08,747
You're qualified to be
a great martial arts master only.

966
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:11,120
But being a king or a great general,

967
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,592
You are not qualified
to be named a sassier the Invincible.

968
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,255
I want to be king, I have to recruit
a great general first.

969
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:21,858
I want you to be my general,
so I will show you my power.

970
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,428
If I had practiced the Sacred Scroll.

971
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:26,939
You'd not have defeated me.

972
01:27:27,175 --> 01:27:31,134
Anyway, our fight
should have been over.

973
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,872
You're wrong!
Our fight has not been over yet.

974
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:46,654
Give it to me.

975
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:55,698
It's too easy to defeat you.

976
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:59,302
Your 14 valves
are both live and dead.

977
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,274
Let me open your closed valves.

978
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,071
Your Kungfu will be improved greatly,

979
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:06,337
so you are able to fight with me.

980
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,152
Koo, watch it.

981
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:14,973
Snow, I said...

982
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,108
I didn't hope to see you
in the battlefield again.

983
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:18,980
I want to see Asia the Invincible.

984
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:10,594
Snow!

985
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:00,219
Snow, I will save you.

986
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:04,549
Only Asia the invincible can save me.

987
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:11,796
Snow, come back to me now.

988
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:16,092
Holy Master.

989
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:29,843
Do you think it's worth doing it?

990
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:34,854
I have waited for this moment.

991
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:38,215
I know you come for me.

992
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,476
Koo, get lost.

993
01:32:16,597 --> 01:32:19,065
Koo, return Snow to me.

994
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:20,656
I won't return her to you.

995
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:22,965
Come to get her yourself.

996
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:32,370
Asia the Invincible,
you are always alone.

997
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,072
Why do you follow me?

998
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:36,341
Don't go!

999
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:40,817
Snow, no matter how,

1000
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:42,549
I have to take you back.

1001
01:33:06,047 --> 01:33:09,710
But what a pity that,
you could never hear what he said.

1002
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:11,749
Otherwise, you'd be very happy.

1003
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:13,183
Hand her to me.

1004
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:26,097
Asia the Invincible,
it's useless for anything you said.

1005
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,633
She could never hear you.

1006
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:31,404
You are lying!

1007
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:55,652
You have never trusted anybody.

1008
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:57,458
You've made it.

1009
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:59,931
But you have got no one
to stay with you.

1010
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,171
Asia the Invincible, you always
want to search for yourself.

1011
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:12,006
Actually, what you have done,

1012
01:34:12,113 --> 01:34:13,910
either good or bad, that's you.

1013
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:15,505
I don't need you to tell me.

1014
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:18,380
What a pity that, you are always
making remedy to what you've lost.

1015
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:20,181
But, you never treasure
the things you've gained.

1016
01:34:20,287 --> 01:34:22,983
I want you to lose
what you have gained.

1017
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:35,895
Well, but I want her back now.

1018
01:34:48,883 --> 01:34:55,311
Snow. Let's start
from the very beginning.

1019
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:05,259
Asia the Invincible.
