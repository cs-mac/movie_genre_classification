1
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,051
Should you insist on having bobble
you should save on the chin too.

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,851
In order to balance the whole thing.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,207
- Balancing?
- Yes.

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,369
- Can you come here a minute?
- No.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,931
It's that time now, you know.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,244
Yes, but I have not the time.
I have to work.

7
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,166
It's cool.

8
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,165
- Nervous about meeting?
- Occasionally.

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,568
Can Kenneth Skoglund be kind
and contact the front desk?

10
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,371
Kenneth Skoglund to reception.

11
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,966
<i> Kenneth Skoglund to reception. </ I>

12
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,487
(phone signal)

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,204
- What are we waiting for?
-Kenneth.

14
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,447
<i> - Is there anyone who has seen him?
- Kenneth Skoglund to reception. </ I>

15
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,523

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,844
- I <i> go. You can sit here for so long.
- Kenneth Skoglund to reception. </ I>

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,810
(phone signal)
<i> Hello? </ I>

18
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,131
Kjelle?
My computer is blue again on the screen.

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,921
Blue and a lot of text:
"A problem has been dectected".

20
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,481
Then it blows warm air from the fan.
Should it do that?

21
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,608
No thanks.
Put them in the conference.

22
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,764
- It's medwurst.
- No, put them in the conference.

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,722
- Have you seen Kenneth?
- No.

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,291
I did not ask you.

25
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,807
<i> - Have you Pillat on settings?
- No. </ i>

I have no idea.

29
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,045
It's best if you come here with it.

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,728
I have all the installation files
and tools and stuff here.

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,762
<i> - Can Kenneth Skoglund come...

32

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,202
<i> - Kenneth Skoglund to reception.
- Um... Yes, I will. </ I>

34
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,966
Skoglund!
Is there anyone who has seen Kenneth?

35
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,920
- What Kenneth?
- Skoglund, I told you. Are you deaf?

36
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,001
- Duty calls.
- Yes, again today.

37
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,929
Haha, yeah... It's good.

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,810
Ken...

39
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,841
(Phone signal)

40
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,531
<i> Kenneth Skoglund
to material supply. </ I>

41
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,484
(Kenneth groans heavily)

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,087
What is it that happened?

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,047
Oh, where are you? - Hello.

44
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,965
Some are waiting for you there.
We have a small meeting.

45
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,920
If you have the desire to look past
so surely it would be pretty good.

46
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,524
<i> Kenneth Skoglund to reception.
Kenneth Skoglund to reception. </ I>

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,087
Well, you want me to start...

48
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,166
For clarity only.

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,928
As. And...

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,571
Ja... Why does it look like this then,
you wonder.

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,487
Well, it is then simply
because of the... or the mismatch-

52
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,723
-resulting
between supply and demand.

53
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,441
Contraindications our resource,
so to speak.

54
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,769
Here then...

55
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,327
Here... 0Ch here.

56
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,523
That should not be sitting here.

57
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,524
The  we put there instead
so it becomes much clearer.

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,083
Then on the other hand this
we see a line representing-

59
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,122
-our mâlfokusnivâ.
But in December we reach-

60
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,090
-the critical point
for liquidity, KPR-

61
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,130
-in the form of a crosspoint.

62
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,329
And it is then analyzed
in some parts down here.

63
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,404
We take for example:
master who vandalized-

64
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,167
base stations that failed,
shaky power grid and...

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,721
We lose customers.

66
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,407
It is well these points
I think-

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,407
-that customers do not want,
but rather then vice versa.

68
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,366
Are you with me? On the contrary.

69
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,129
Yeah. Thank you, Kenneth.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,449
This was well
the worst Monday meeting date.

71
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,489
Yeah, it's fucked.

72
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,771
This was the man's not wiser.
It was expected not-

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,481
-when you got into the car four forty-five
and drove 40 mil on an empty stomach.

74
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,806
Sitting here like a fool, being invited
the loaf and watch the kids artwork.

75
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,851
It is obvious that it happened
shit here since you took over, Tord.

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,483
It's 2011 now. You may uproot your
and give us a sensible report.

77
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,087
Give us a report, dammit.
Something you can hold in your hand.

78
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,561
It hoped we get here today.

79
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,930
But apparently it has the
something happened along the way.

80
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,610
I did not sejva. I got of those
blue screen on the computer and mass text.

81
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,489
But it is mending now-

82
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,725
-So it should be possible to recreate
somehow, it said.

83
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,001
I ate a fish casserole in front of the television and
slötittade the quiz.

84
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,123
They broke for commercials
shortly before the final round.

85
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,525
So they show one of our commercials
and I sat thinking quietly:

86
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,530
"How the hell was really the
who made this film?"

87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,968
Now I do not.
I think that it is a clockwork concept.

88
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,043
But is it really?

89
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,329
(Door slamming, heavy footsteps)

90
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,171
Please God, help me.

91
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,403
A mature profiling, we said.
I think it is stylish.

92
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,086
It's damn quasi noir.

93
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,130
"We hear you." That's what we do.
Hello, hello?

94
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,047
It looks just like the Women's Shelter,
fixed with free sms first month.

95
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,921
Do we get the arrow pointing up again
we have to reinvent ourselves.

96
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,323
No one would invest money
in these kinds of formal experimentation.

97
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,689
We know how
quarterly report will look like. We have to show-

98
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,084
-we have things going on, that we are
attractive, retain their market value.

99
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,849
Less Bergman, more Crazy Frog.

100
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,041
Yes, yes, I get it. But we must surely
still account for something.

101
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,841
Just ask Kenneth pressing "print", so
has the well report by tomorrow?

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,685
I take fourth on the carpet,
if that's okay.

103
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,401
- Is that like...
- Shh!

104
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,600
There is a fan, Gil Grissom.
The spins and cools.

105
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,481
- It was not that I...
- Where have you backup disk then?

106
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,450
You save well on backups,
be hoped.

107
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,129
- Huh?
- Sometimes.

108
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,126
- Regularly?
- Irregular.

109
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,005
Simply insert an external hd
in usbzn and autosejva every day.

110
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,801
- Yes, it should perhaps have done.
- Mm.

111
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,444
Otherwise we would not have needed
sit here today.

112
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,649
What do you think?
Is it possible to save anything?

113
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,088
What the hell do you think? It is clean
Bondi Beach. The only thing missing-

114
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,290
-'s a fucking umbrella in the motherboard.
You have sand in your computer. And what is it?

115
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,603
I do not see what it is.
What is this? Is that hair?

116
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,331
Is it your hair?
Cut bangs at home next time-

117
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,246
And set your PC in a fucking cupboard
if you can not keep clean around you.

118
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,008
The problem is that you're so damn noob.
You will with noobiga me questions.

119
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,640
- Noob...?
- Noob!

120
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,160
Picking out a Pentium II in machinery
so, you can manage for a while.

121
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,890
With Excel and everything.

122
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,442
Put ​​a postitlapp on the bulletin board
so that we know what you did.

123
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,170
Okay.

124
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,443
So now, Kenneth.

125
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,766
(Door closes)

126
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,924
Hello?

127
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,010
- Thank you.
-Go.

128
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,165
It must be tough
to be cleaner and...

129
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,086
The clash a bit, but I go
a course now, so I'll live.

130
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,082
Well, that's good.

131
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,969
Now we approach Prästberget.
We'll be there in about 15 minutes. Come on.

132
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,043
Roger that. 15 minutes. </ I>

133
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,964
I wait until further then.

134
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,604
- How the hell do you succeed with that?
- Throw the stone.

135
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,411
- It's not loud then?
- Climb then.

136
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,848
That they just can. There are four,
five times we have been here for years.

137
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,970
- Snorkels Kids on Cocillana.
- Cocillana?

138
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,329
Cough. It is totally passé
with plastic and glue now.

139
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,450
Now it cough syrup.
It is the thing.

140
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,526
(Electrical buzzing)

141
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,204
(beep)

142
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,886
<i> Renew your profile, press 1. </ I>

143
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,361
I'm about average, I guess.

144
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,605
With a few extra pounds
as I'm about to work off.

145
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,487
A friend used to say
I look-

146
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,962
-as a mixture of Ola Ullsten
and Ted Danson.

147
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,090
on the sitcom "Cheers", that is.

148
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,889
Uh... the best of both worlds,
maybe you could say.

149
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,811
Remember what we said now, Bridget.

150
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,843
Breathe gently through your nose,
out through your mouth.

151
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,962
(Breathing nervously)

152
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,408
So yes. This gârju good.

153
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,846
This is going great.

154
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:54,445
Yeah, now it's Jörgen. Then you
pinch voltage on PL 4046th

155
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,922
<i> Prästberget, four, zero, four, six. </ I>

156
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,884
<i> Is it disconnected,
cut and dried? </ I>

157
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,571
- Yes?
- Hey, you, Stig.

158
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,884
- Hello? Repeat.
- Yes, I can.

159
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,761
PL four, zero, four six Prästberget.

160
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,287
Is that clear, disarmed?

161
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,765
- Uh, roger.
- Perfect. Then we make tonight. Goodbye.

162
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,722
- It's just to run!
- Here we go!

163
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,484
Okay.

164
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,531
(Screams)

165
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,011
Please contact Kenneth Skoglund.

166
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,447
Damn, I have no... Fan!

167
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,082
- I just wanted to so a little seed.
- Yes, I understand that.

168
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,969
What the hell is it now?

169
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,648
Yes, this is good, this, Bridget.

170
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,609
Do not worry, it's fine.

171
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,646
(Hysterical women cry)

172
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,284
Roland?

173
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,888
He may be here tonight, then we take
him to the ICU tomorrow.

174
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,726
It is not life threatening, just
to oversee, so we'll see tomorrow-

175
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,848
-when he wakes up the way he is.

176
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,800
- Roland? Do you hear me?
- I think not.

177
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,483
BSOD - Blue Screen Of Death.

178
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,966
Sauron?

179
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,971
Birgitta? Motherfucker.

180
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,449
What happened, Birgitta?

181
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,042
<i> Welcome to Loveline.
... You have no new messages. </ I>

182
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,210
(toot)

183
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,764
<i> (un, m, m) </ i>

184
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,051
This is estimated
repair costs.

185
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,967
Accepted tort filings,
far. As the pile Iärju increase.

186
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,441
And here is
incoming business invoices.

187
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,491
And then we have our outgoing invoices,
incomes.

188
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,130
- What do you want me to do with it?
- Burn it up.

189
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,647
Wear it down in the parking lot
and burn it up.

190
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,480
I joked,
but it's a tempting idea.

191
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,042
Burning up all that shit.
Burn down the whole building.

192
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,680
So are the days of trouble later.

193
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,043
You can let the papers remain
and wear down the rest to Kenneth.

194
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,890
Ask him when you can finally
expect a full report.

195
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,808
Yeah, maybe I'll help you carry.

196
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,000
It is not necessary. I run bodypump
three times a week, so I'm good.

197
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,642
Yes... it is a heavy yoke
you have got shoulder after the old man.

198
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,651
Designate a focus group. Now we are reforming.
Young and fresh, we have.

199
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,891
And in color.

200
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,761
So... They're for you.

201
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,727
Valter wondering if you finish
with the quarterly report.

202
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,681
No, my computer is still
for repair. But it will come.

203
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,324
Ouch, man.

204
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,691
Damn.

205
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,362
Try to turn it on now.
This was certainly yours.

206
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,603
- Is it running?
Yes, but the screen was a bit small.

207
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,808
Relax, we're not finished.

208
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,210
As.

209
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,769
Ta-Daah!

210
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,570
It's good to go.

211
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,611
You know it is
the internal size that matters, right?

212
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,525
Now suck it in the coffee arm.

213
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,445
What's the password?

214
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,682
"Blizzard".

215
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,603
How do you spell it...?

216
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,884
How much will you remember?

217
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,084
Do you remember anything
from the accident itself?

218
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,361
- No.
- And after that?

219
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,445
When you woke up, you will remember
anything of what I said?

220
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,562
You wondered how I felt.
And then...

221
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,523
... Told you what had happened,
that I had been in an accident.

222
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,690
And...

223
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,809
... I had gotten
current through the body.

224
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,129
<i> 3a </ i> I something more?

225
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,444
Um...

226
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,327
You told me that I...

227
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
... That I had the power...

228
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,408
... By the arm...

229
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,410
... And down in. .. scrotum.

230
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,484
And that it had gone out in. ..

231
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,242
... Testicles then.

232
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,203
Then out of the harness, safety harness.

233
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,083
And then...

234
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,729
... So you tell me
I could not have children.

235
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,288
- Have you told Karin yet?
- No, I have not done.

236
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,568
I think you should.

237
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,524
And I think you ought
be glad you're alive, Roland.

238
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,769
You have to start at the end,
simply.

239
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,130
These kinds of accidents usually get
a much more tragic...

240
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,681
-... A much more tragic outcome.
- Mm.

241
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,605
- But you're alive, Roland.
- Yes.

242
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,366
You live and can walk.

243
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,046
- Or did they?
- Mm.

244
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,007
- It's good.
- Yes.

245
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,568
- Have you purchased balloon?
- Mm.

246
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,530
You should sue the bastard.

247
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,163
Release a tarantula
just like that, right in the face.

248
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,881
- Tarantella.
- Damn, that is.

249
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,840
There must be
some kind of law against that sort of thing.

250
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,483
- Yes, gross misconduct or something.
- Yes, you feel it.

251
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,440
- But apparently it was my own fault.
- Asch.

252
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,286
Yes, I think so anyway -
tuning the därjäveln once and for all.

253
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,887
- But I guess I can not do.
- Yes, tuning the bastard.

254
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,681
- You can not sue people.
- Yes, I think so.

255
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,810
Tuning the bastard
and head to Majorca for money.

256
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,282
- Berit, you can not.
- Why not?

257
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,404
We have a date tonight.

258
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,169
Lisa Karlsson? Frank Björklund?

259
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,370
Sonja Andersson?
Veronica Heikkinen?

260
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,727
Valter Sigvardsson.

261
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,530
I congratulate you all.

262
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:57,164
Raise your hand again, so we see that
we counted correctly. Six pieces with me.

263
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,845
Congratulations.

264
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,722
Rest of you NCK unfortunately not place this year
in the focus group. We thank you.

265
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,048
So... you can leave us now,
so we'll get to work.

266
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,487
Time is money, as I said.

267
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,043
- Ulla, I read your name?
-Uh... yeah, it...

268
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,043
... That... yeah, it was... that I heard.

269
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,282
No, I guess I did not really know.

270
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,445
It was Lisa Karlsson, Frank Björklund,
Sonja, Veronika and Valter.

271
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,443
And then there was Ulla there.

272
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,762
Please Ulla, do not start again
with this.

273
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,168
- It's new train all the time.
- No, it does not.

274
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,084
You said that last year too.

275
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,325
Ulla, I am extremely sorry,
but you're not the one we are looking for this year.

276
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,164
We hope for next year...

277
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,120
You have just opened the gates
to hell, just so you know it!

278
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,161
(Slams the door)

279
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,284
Yes. What a star-studded bunch, huh?

280
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,683
A marvelous team. Are you tagged?

- Hey! How does it work?
- God, you scared.

292

It's fine, I'm almost finished.
You, uh, we need to talk.

- What if?
- Ohoj!

- Cake,

- We'll talk after work.
Yes,

296
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,531
And then angles you up.

297
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,366
But... huh? Would you eat this?

298
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,528
Yes, it is only today.

299
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,605
Karin's parents will.
We have nowhere else to sit.

300
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,086
You can set it there.

301
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,403
We'll put it in the center here.

302
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,724
- How is the situation then?
- It's great.

303
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,126
- Or what do you mean?
Yes, no, or I guess it is...

304
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,168
Yes, how you feel.
The Iåterju good about it is great.

305
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,401
No, it's just the
to go and think.

306
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,565
- On what?
-Voltage supposed to be off.

307
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,247
It was... the excitement was on.

308
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,880
So one gârju and think a little...

309
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,771
- Why? How could it happen?
- Yeah.

310
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,561
No one knows yet.
The hâllerju on and investigate that.

311
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,523
We're on hearing the work environment authority,
so... well, we'll see.

312
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,251
- May I ask you a question?
-Mm.

313
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,442
Littereringen - remember it?

314
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,851
- PL 4046 is the well? What then?
- Yes, but are you sure?

315
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,722
Wondering if I'm sure of it?
Yes, uh...

316
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,249
We've been there a thousand times type,
so yes. What's the question?

317
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,167
Are you honest and say it is so, then
I believe in you.

318
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,404
- If I'm honest?
- Yes.

319
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,645
If you say it is 4046
then I get to believe in you.

320
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,361
It is well clearly you have faith in me.
What the hell are you doing?

321
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,888
- Are you stupid? It's not my fault.
- I'm not stupid.

322
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,125
- No, but you may take and give to you.
- I have become sterile.

323
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,600
What, sterile?
How so sterile? What?

324
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,525
We can not have children.

325
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,681
NOW. Igor! Now!

326
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,521
Yes, it's alive!

327
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,806
Can you stop scratching?
You must anoint with ointment of those.

328
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,760
- Roland...
- Wow, you have spilled a little there.

329
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,366
- Take some of the pants too.
- Roland balls went up in flames.

330
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,921
He can not get any child anymore
Because of the accident.

331
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,967
- What, flames?
- The electricity went through my body...

332
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,968
... And out between his legs.
He ​​can not... He Became sterile.

333
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,481
- God. Huh?
- Yes.

334
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,921
- What says Karin?
- Karin? He has not...

335
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,442
He's gonna tell tonight.
Karin does not know anything yet.

336
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,566
No, but I supposed
put parquet ago.

337
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,408
This is only until further
while you run in and out.

338
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,131
It works pretty well anyway.

339
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,204
- What will the parquet then?
- Yes, that's the big question.

340
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,601
- I sägerju laminate.
- Yes, and I say dark oak.

341
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,730
Okay.

342
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,727
Beware the nails of the feet only.

343
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,962
And here is the children's room.

344
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,682
- I want it pink for the day.
- Ah, it's time now.

345
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,721
I'll be knocked up to autumn with
delivery to summer, it said.

346
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,451
- And you can deliver, then?
- Yes, I hope so.

347
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,682
Then it's calcium that apply.
Calcium, folic acid and cranberries.

348
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,765
- Now, if you want a girl.
- And hold the scrotum hot, Roland.

349
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,491
- It did Bosse when we got you.
- Mom...!

350
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,326
He received 40,000 volts right in the package
so it can not be something problem.

351
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,482
- Right, Roland?
No, no.

352
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,010
Ha! Contrary, as the skipper said,
and put the stern to the wind. Cheers!

353
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,324
And let's drown the salte fan
with a ball in the blow hole.

354
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,883
Tjo, tjoo!
Tough, tough, tough, tough, tjo, tjo, tjo!

355
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,847
- What a fucking blowhole?
-It's "Moby Dick."

356
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,246
When he sets off from the port
so says Captain Ahab it.

357
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,486
- In the version then?
- Yes, it's the last. But...

358
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,449
<i> - Yeah, right... Tp (30.
-Shell </ i>

359
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,201
I am the strongest woman
on this planet.

360
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,568
Well... There he lay,

361
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,442
-with arms hopkrullade like this.

362
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,762
Aaron, there are surely more spiders
for you out there.

363
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,282
Not like Sauron.

364
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,086
But... now I really feel guilty.
Is it my fault?

365
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,608
No, Bridget, you may not think so.

366
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,369
A tarantella is
a wayward creature-

367
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,243
and it makes the as it wants,
when it wants and how it wants.

368
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,643
- It must of course respect.
- Mmm.

369
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,931
You are so tender, Aaron, do you know?

370
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,925
And you, it's like...

371
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,844
... You know everything about everything.
And you know everything about me.

372
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,290
Yes, Bridget,
this with doctor and patient...

373
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,804
Bridget, I do not believe it.

374
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,571
- But you're probably just trainers?
- Yes, I've actually diploma.

375
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,091
But the friendship that we have grown now...
I think we should continue-

376
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,481
-be friends and...

377
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,202
Yes, I have a little gift here
to you. Here you are.

378
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,210
- What is that something?
- It's a aftonhud.

379
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,123
- Aftonhud?
- It's a prototype.

380
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,411
It is not on the market yet.
It is soothing to sleep at night-

381
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,246
and also protects against mites
and small arachnids.

382
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,165
It's a damned alert thing,
I must say.

383
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,451
- I may well not me on this?
-Well, it is stretch.

384
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,489
- Well.
- Yes.

385
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,291
- It is soft.
-Sure

386
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,288
There is a little gap here also
for those times you need.

387
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,525
So, with Velcro.
It's actually really handy.

388
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,967
(Velcro ritsch)

389
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,401
Ja...

390
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,930
Excuse me, can I get a knife and fork?

391
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,367
- Does it taste good, Ted Danson?
- Why, you... please tell me Kenneth.

392
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,202
Well, Tarja, it... Four small dishes
's no surprises.

393
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,087
But still good and affordable.
And it's a little of each.

394
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,046
- And yours?
- Let's not talk about me.

395
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,680
We'll talk about you.

396
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,561
What do Mr. Danson if
more than to eat Chinese food?

397
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,006
I brought a small gift.
Welcome.

398
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,768
- I make candles.
- Make candles? Oh, oh, oh, oh!

399
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,771
It is pretty damn interesting
how to play with shapes-

400
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,844
and add both flavor and color.
Smell.

401
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,482
Smells like coconut.
There is like that aroma candles.

402
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,688
Yes, scented candles.

403
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,810
I call it djungelkub.

404
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,486
You can do pretty much as you want.

405
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,087
And even with beeswax,
which is a bit of a classic-

406
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,527
-one hand rolls.

407
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,048
Yes, then there will be enough
very much dip the wick.

408
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,288
What do you like?

409
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,880
Kuk.

410
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,611
Cock, dick, dick, dick.

411
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,730
And some scrapbooking.

412
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,882
With cocks.

413
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,891
How to Open a bottle of raki
and cozy up to it at my house?

414
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,489
I have not finished eating yet.
It included fried banana and ice cream.

415
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,644
- I can fry your path!
- And so the day tomorrow...

416
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,371
(Tarja sings Finnish tango)

417
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,526
- What I would remind you of?
- What?

418
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,887
There was something important we would talk about.

419
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,209
Um... Yes, that's right.

420
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,962
Well, Karin...

421
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,090
Mm?

422
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,886
- I sat and thought about the floors.
- Mm.

423
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,887
That we can run laminate

424
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,884
-instead of parquet.

425
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,528
- I see no difference.
- There are many square meters.

426
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,524
So we spararju few hundred or thousand
maybe.

427
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,162
Maybe we can put it in the kids room.
And try to get it done.

428
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,647
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

429
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,485
There was little so I thought.

430
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,648
Hell.

431
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,846
(Finnish Tango)

432
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,607
Grrr!

433
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,963
Mister Danson...

434
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,241

00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,685
No, it is fully here. Be on time.

440
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,763
So maybe you have time to lift.

441
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,084
How's quarterly report,
Kenneth? Huh?

442
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,650
I can not understand that man.

443
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,962
- You should struta the bastard.
- Struta?

444
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,766
I was strutad in Cambridge.
In the middle of the lesson. Hell, yeah.

445
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,489
What the hell...?

446
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,480
- Kjell?
- Shoot,

447

454
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,807
There have been some more paper.

455
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,400
Tord know what this will
mean for us financially?

No, for all väntarju

No, I see it. Tord want to meet you
today in the conference ten thirty.

459
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,208
He sounded pissed.

Maybe I should change the planer

00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,204
It flared up yesterday,
and since then I have been lying awake.

00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:47,091
- Does it show much?
- Yes.

Roland is the physiotherapist,

I had thought that we would
talk about this all three.

490
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,527
He probably told you
with the accident and all.

491
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,524
Yes, he has.

492

But it's nothing you should go around
and remorse over.

It was an accident.
It was not directly your fault, Hey.

Shit, I thought you'd be
to pieces over this.

495

How then, do you mean?

496
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,806
He has talked about this
with family and kids and everything.

497
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,930
We can still have a family.

It seems terse make

-but what is the third, fourth,
fifth, sixth, seventh time?

509
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,204
This is more like a behavior.
And so we do not want it.

as it ever goes.

it is not right really.

have been seen, but I can not say...

Path Ulander can not confirm
your inkall this day.

559
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,927
Can he confirm my inkall
to the control center?

560
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,163
This sounds really...
I talked to him...

561
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,769
I talked to him twice
and it is he who has responded...

Where was the Stig?

and with droopy pants
to the ankles.

581
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,126
Yes, we have no more.

582
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,047
- We have no more?
- I just bought it for 1200 bucks.

Now we are back on track.

- Maybe it's the catch...
- Shut up.

586
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,004
- Is there a Luger or?
- Hell if I know.

587
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,367

should sit a catch...

... Press a little here?

592
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,091
Oh no. It smarts a little.

593
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,282
If I turn it to the side then?

594
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,204
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

595
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,400
And then you have these eliminated
both on the neck and cheek.

596
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,008
How long have you had it?

597
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:05,131
Yes, it came a few there late.
It was quite a while ago, now...

598
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,568
So, just poof, poffade up and...

599
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,408
And so it is that dizziness
and a little tingling or what...

600
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,248
I saw your Unicom jacket outside.

- I am electrician.

602
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,927
It's very diverse.
We do lots of stuff.

603
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:33,964
Now we have installed the radio masts
and transmitters, most of mobile.

604
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,161
Is there a vulnerable environment, do you think?

605
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,245
I think the radiation levels.

606
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,689
We mäterju of levels.
Then know and stay below it.

607
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,209
Yes, but you know, every little helps.
Is not that what they say?

608
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,889
No, I do not
what you mean by that.

609
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,409
I think we see
a severe EHS here.

610

Yes, that is...

611
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:09,521
Electrical hypersensitivity is perhaps most hittepå.
Yes, if it's something psychological...

No, your body can tolerate only a certain amount of
with electromagnetic radiation-

613
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,650
-before saying from
and become hypersensitive.

614
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,964
- It is a kind of allergy.
- When it goes away? It disappears well?

615
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,684
Well...

616
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,806
Now you'll get anything from me here.

617
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,363
<i>, Hi-
, Hello, </ i>

618
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,449
Now you'll
contact details of me here.

619
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,764
This is a support group.
Very safe environment.

620
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,963
They know much more about this than I do.
If you have any questions.

621
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,882
And I'm sure you have.

622
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,165
Good luck now. Ugh, yes...

623
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,642
- So, you should get a swab of the ear.
-Oh.

624
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,131
Yes, it was nicely shot.

625
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,363
It's a shame that it's just a painting
and the old man is dead long time ago.

626
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,090
Sorry.

627
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,089
Come and sit.

628
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,086
I understand you had a setback
and uphill-

629
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:25,040
-with your computer and the quarterly report

630
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,167
Then it was well
damn stupid of me-

631
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,767
-to struta you for all...

632
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,080
But I do not know, I have a little...

633
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:43,086
I'm not so good at that
with people and expressions.

634
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,005
- Cheers to you.
- Shell

635
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,682
It's good it here.

636
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,763
Sorry.

637
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,083
I gave my first girl in school-

638
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,484
-
of an engagement ring molded saffron.

639
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,771
For  Jimmy Sandstrom on Angleramp
had said it was worth more than gold.

640
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,887
And it is well to be sure, but...

641
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,204
They kept on messing with me too
once.

642
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,042
- Saffron?
- Yes, it was expensive wines.

643
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,608
I had might as well have purchased
a bag Iussebullar.

644
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,966
What, hypersensitive?
What does that mean?

645
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,327
Well, honey, it is well that the
allergy whatsoever, I understand.

646
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,290
Some can not stand apples.
I can not stand electricity.

647
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,171
- Do we stay in the dark for life?
-I have no idea.

648
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,847
This is why I want to hit
and hear me.

649
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,250
- Can it really be here?
- Yes.

650
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,570
It may well not fucking be.

651
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,170
A careful examination of radiation risks must be done.

652
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:19,564
Before subjecting an entire population-

653
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:23,361
-partly for a new kind of radiation
that nobody knows anything about-

654
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,888
and partly a marked increase
of microwave radiation.

655
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,807
I shudder to the core
when I hear of the 4G network-

656
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,681
-as they kick off the fourteenth.
On Friday!

657
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:40,004
We then? We? Where are white road?
We are refugees in our own country.

658
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,041
You can even hear how fucking crazy it sounds.
Deprived, damn!

659
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,488
I'll tell you
that none of us is safe anymore.

660
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,363
- Would you like that?
- No.

661
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,761
- Would you like that?!
- No.

662
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,524
No, I thought so.

663
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,490
So... hell for humanity!

664
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,764
Bloody armjävel! Watch the damn thing.
The kommerju never grow out.

665
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,810
- Have not we sacrificed enough now?
- J0.

666
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,327
- Have not we sacrificed enough?
- J0.

667
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,881
- Have not we sacrificed enough?!
- Yes!

668
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,805
- Have not we...
- Yes! Jooo!

669
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,962
Jooo!

670
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,485
Jo!

671
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,411
Ja... Five minutes,
five minutes, five minutes.

672
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,325
There is coffee and buns.

673
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,564
Hello.

674
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,329
(Whispering)

675
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,201
Wood oven baked.

676
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,125
- Go ahead.
Thanks.

677
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,370
Oops!

678
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,209
You know what I like about you?
Guile you will rapporteurs with.

679
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,410
You rush in with a wad of ear
and think you can force your in-

680
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:30,248
-take part of our agenda, eat our
buns. Do not you think I get it?

681
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,927
I did not know you had a meeting.

682
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:38,961
The doctor has told
that I would get in touch with you.

683
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,327
- Doctor?
- Yes.

684
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,970
Mhm? Funny feeling much?

685
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:54,011
Lemonade in your hands?
Cheeks? Is this true?

686
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,803
Is not it better that you tell
what you think I can help you with-

687
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,531
-instead of me to stand here
and guess which thing ye?

688
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:06,403
I need help elsanering.
Elsanera Pokey... Not?

689
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:10,246
No. Sure, it was -92.

690
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,201
Now it is not -92.

691
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,682
What you need is an oasis.

692
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,087
- An oasis?
- An oasis.

693
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,163
Fuck!

694
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,049
(VERY)

695
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,610
Ooh!

696
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,402
Motherfucker!

697
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:39,290
- Haha! I think it will be fun.
- No one will take anything, but fun it is.

698
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,525
- But with Goebbels is a bit much.
- Do you like it?

699
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,921
I delete it, it is gone.

700
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,447
- It is fully here.
- No, it's not full.

701
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,921
Make Kenneth,
you can take my place.

702
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,651
What the hell kind von oben attitude?

703
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,611
I have a gift for you.

704
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,525
Then you would be able to have Excel on the left-


705
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:05,163
and anything Word document on the right,
so you can multitask after all.

706
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,606
- It will be good?
- What's that smell here?

707
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,888
Is that de la Renta or?

708
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,329
- No, no, no, it ärjasminmynta.
- Yeah.

709
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,602
It's from the lights.
Yes, I can see.

710
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,480
I make them myself.

711
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:32,090
- Yes, you can... You may take one of these.
- Really? Yes please.

712
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,403
- I call it venus cake.
- Penis Cake? Did you say that?

713
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,404
No, Valter, venus cake.

714
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,401
It actually smells a little cake.

715
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,406
- Yes, very muskig.
-The smells, the more when they are lit.

716
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,246
Here we can not stand by and drälla. We have
press release and launch at. 16.

717
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,370
Yes, we get the wedge. - Hello, Kenneth.

718
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,805
"I make my own light."
It screams serial killer on the man.

719
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,045
- It's good that he has a hobby.
- They said about Jeffrey Dahmer too.

720
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,485
Make sure to be down before sex.
Take it easy with that.

721
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,610
I go to Jorgen and install.

722
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,728
Focus, Ulla.

723
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,728
(Warning signal, operating machinery)

724
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,211
Prästberget?
No, I'm sick.

725
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,886
I can not even talk in this one.
Cell phone.

726
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:54,728
Ring Roland. He's back now.
He ​​may need to get there in therapy.

727
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,521
Mm. Well, where were we lucky.
Yes, hello to you.

728
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,407
- What the hell is that?
- It's an oasis.

729
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,803
- And will you live in?
- Yes, for a little while then.

730
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,769
Sure, Sorro.
There are major raw cozy out.

731
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:17,366
It is perfect! Right down there alone!
Come on.

732
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,644
Perfect!

733
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,404
Roland?

734
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,006
<i> We have received less downtime.
It would be great if you could check out. </ I>

735
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,724
<i> Hey, Roland? Do you hear me? </ I>

736
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,847

737
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,482
<i> - Where </ i> is <i> Jorgen? Have you asked Jorgen?

really knows his limits.

741
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:51,882
For us, it was as intolerant
to live in a giant microwave.

742
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,006
OOPS. Well, damn.

743
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:00,329
Expansion goes on.
But there is no one who cares.

744
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,690

We are a few out here in the compound
sometimes, then, now and then-

748
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:28,966
-try, we think of something a little rebellion.
So there and then.

749
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,407
And last so...

750
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,607
Damn, that was the blackout in the whole town.

751
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,600
You must have noticed it.

752
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,083
Strange that.

It's so damn tiring.
No one cares. Get it?

765
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:14,450
No one cares about us. Then you get
find other ways to make yourself heard.

766
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,683
What, find other ways
to make yourself heard?

767
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,083
- What the hell does that mean?
- You'll see.

768
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,686
(Try to start the petrol engine)

769
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,849
Hello?

770
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,566
What are you doing?

771
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,563
Must all stand there? Someone may well
Hell lookout too.

772
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,523
Nervous?

773
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,603
Just take it easy.

774
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,650
You're a tiger, Tord.
Check, a tiger.

775
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,886
Okay, now I'm out here.
See you soon - "online".

776
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:41,123
And you, take it easy on those.

777
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,162
Do you have an eye on the situation there
so it syncs with all connections?

778
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,360
(Phone signal)

779
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,610
But...

780
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,770
Ladies and gentlemen!
To-o-o-word Wedin!

781
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,687
Yes! Yes!

782
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,528
Korn on, come on!

783
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,603
Come on!

784
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,644
I say that Nick Borgen:
"We are all the winners."

785
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,569
Although the clouds are heavy
and the curtain went down, we are all winners.

786
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:07,045
Only we hang with. Not true?
Yes! Yes! Yes!

787
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,131
Hey!

788
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,291
The fourth generation is here.
4G network is here.

789
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,568
A new standard is here.

790
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:10,009
- Hello, Walter!
-Full / o, Sweden.

791
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:17,604
How is the situation up at Forge Lake?
It's a bit chilly, I think.

792
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,446
<i> No. And there's no such thing as
bad weather, only bad clothing. </ I>

793
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,171
Yes, absolutely.
The latter we can agree with.

794
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:29,565
Where did you dig up that old
leather coat? German surplus stock?

795
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,841
You look like a little chorizo ​​
in felt hat, I think.

796
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,365
<i> Thanks, Tord. </ I>

797
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,845
<i> I thought we could redirect
focus a bit to what you see behind me. </ I>

798
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,244
<i> Prästberget and its mast ,
soon be activated. </ i>

799
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,684
(cars)

800
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,842
(flasher)

801
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,170
Car!

802
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,801
Where is Roland?

803
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,845
Roland? Roland? Do you hear me?

804
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,241
What the hell?! Uh!

805
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,208
- You take it easy!
- You can not!

806
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,968
We must away!

807
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:51,526
<i> With our misfortune that the
many companies have to contend with. </ I>

808
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:56,163
<i> But we took the bull by the horns
and are ready to put it behind us, </ i>

809
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,164
<i> and lit a small candle
for the future. </ I>

810
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:04,243
Thank you, Valter, for those words. Hear ye.

811
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:09,042
We are reaching the climax, before the
red light comes on Prästberget-

812
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:14,047
-I would like to thank our
investors, perhaps most of all...

813
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,927
What the hell?

814
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,481
4G man! Yes! Unicorn King!

815
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,204
So!

816
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,487
(Phone signal)

817
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,848
(Woman whimpers)

818
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,126
(dial tone)

819
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,643
- Cheers to you.
- Yes, bowl.

820
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,930
You motherfucker should have fan
some kind of trophy. Right?

821
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,971
- Pushed you back here all the time?
- You never know.

822
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:35,011
But hey...
Here, relax a bit now. You've...

823
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,567
- I do not drink.
-Really? No, no.

824
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,041
Then there will be more to us.
Bottoms up.

825
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,370
- What do you have now invented?
-Now, I do not.

826
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,727
- What the hell is going on?
- Fredrik?

827
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,723
- Well, I do not know, everything is just dead.
- What?

828
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,121
- What is it that is dead?
-Everything just went out.

829
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,170
What, extinct?
Can I hit it in there now.

830
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,881
Excuse me.

831
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,686
Ha! Hey you! Hello there!

832
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,969
You! Yes, I saw you!

833
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:09,842
- Forgiven,
- You come down and pick it up.

834
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,924
- ÖQOna-fucking-böjg
-yep.

835
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,290
\ \ \

836
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,485
Come.

837
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,807
- Do you live?
- We think so.

838
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,250
You...

839
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:48,161
Karin, I would have said something from
start. It was just so damn wrong.

840
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,882
You know something? I am with child.

841
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,364
Huh?

842
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,368
Is it mine?

843
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,322
(Karin laughs)

844
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:26,520
- But how?
- It must have been after the crayfish party.

845
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,450
Have you woken up on the wrong side today
or what is this about?

846
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,241
It could well be said.
All week.

847
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,890
- But now it's over.
- What?

848
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,007
Yes, the week. It's Friday.

849
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,605
Is it?

850
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:21,083
- Who is it you remind me of?
- I do not know. Ted Danson...

851
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:24,722
Now wait a minute.
The Iâterjättekonstigt, but...

852
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:30,603
I have a painting at home in the hall.
On one of those crying babies.

853
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,843
- Have you seen them?
- Yes.

854
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,891
When I see you now
I think of that picture.

855
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,927
It is really nice.

856
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:47,403
You look like Barbamama.

857
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,203
Hello.

858
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,050
- Where have you been?
- Oh, yes...

859
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,731
- Itch a lot?
- It tingles most now.

860
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,889
There is less visible
Now when you start getting stubble.

861
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,441
It's fine, I think.

862
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,927
- Need a light?
- Shit, you scared.

863
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,570
Are you really sure about this?

864
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,408
(Sighs heavily)

865
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,923
Fits you?

866
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:31,885
Mmm!

867
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,811
It smells almost like shampoo.

868
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,327
Yes, it is...

869
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:46,761
It's lavender and thyme extracts.
Self-mixing.

870
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,891
And this is dyed horsehair.

871
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:57,482
I call her "Anne of Green Gables."

872
01:30:57,640 --> 01:31:00,120
What cute.

873
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,965
I'm actually very happy myself.

874
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,730
This is probably
the best I've done.

875
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,042
Oops. But...

876
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,451
God, how great.

877
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,602
- OOPS.

878
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,247
These buggers generates enough power.

879
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,768
- Are not they lovely?
- Very.

880
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:39,163
They are good against sweating too,
it said.

881
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,209
Among other things.

882
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,761
(Velcro ritsch)

883
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,567
Handy.

884
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,048
(Velcro ritsch)

885
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:43,042
