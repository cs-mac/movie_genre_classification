00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:20,765
Let me out!

2
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,444
Why are you doing this to me?

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,823
Please. No.

4
00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:12,526
l'm not a little piggy.

5
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:17,323
l'm not a little piggy.

6
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:21,635
l'm not a little piggy.

7
00:02:18,983 --> 00:02:21,020
Help.

8
00:02:25,423 --> 00:02:28,336
Let me go.

9
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:30,361
Help!

10
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,510
Help!

11
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:40,515
Help.

12
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,618
Let me out, please.

13
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:46,952
Help!

14
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:05,592
Woman: Ashville County Police
Department. What is your emergency?

15
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:08,229
- l was in a box.
- Tell me where you are, ma'am.

16
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:11,706

17
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:13,902
l don't know.

18
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:17,572
l don't. l don't.

19
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:19,878
Ma'am, are you still with me?

20
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:21,815
l don't know.

21
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,479
What do you see around you?
Can you give me any kind of landmark?

22
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:29,547
Dead people.

23
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,184
Dead boxes.

24
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:33,593
l woke up in a box.

25
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:36,963
Can you tell me where we can find you?
We'll send an officer out.

26
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:39,992
Ma'am, you must communicate.
Ma'am?

27
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:46,741
Try to stay on the line for 30 seconds.
We'll run a trace.

28
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:00,847
20 more seconds.

29
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:43,854
Hello?

30
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:54,298
Are you from the police?

31
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:18,231
Bring her out.
l'll take care of the little piggy.

32
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:39,145
Man: ls somebody in there?

33
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:52,427
Oh shoot, a locked door.

34
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:54,868
How'd you get in there?
Are you okay?

35
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:57,338
Don't you worry. l've got some keys.
l'll get you out.

36
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:00,333
- What?
- He's there.

37
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:02,366
No, ain't nobody here but me.
l'll get you out.

38
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,073
Don't worry.
Ain't nobody here.

39
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,546
He's there.

40
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,276
Man: Did you run out of gas?

41
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:24,314
l'd siphon you some of mine, but l'm pretty
much floating on empty myself.

42
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,555
So you got a name?

43
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:36,255
Probably.

44
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:38,730
My name's Tucker.

45
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:41,290
l work back at Schaffer's Mine,
back in the holler.

46
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,728
You ain't from around these parts,
are you?

47
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:50,232
l don't know.

48
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,404
Well, where you come from?

49
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,611
l mean, just now.
Where did you come from?

50
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,552
Where the dead people are.

51
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:02,953
Ooh.

52
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:05,651
That is quite a party, eh?

53
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:10,457
Dead people.
Oh, the cemetery.

54
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,468
Well, can you remember
where your car is

55
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:21,372
or someplace
l can drop you off at then?

56
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,239
Where the police lady is.

57
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:28,145
lf you called 911 ,
that goes into the city.

58
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,410
The police lady will help.

59
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:34,818
Sorry, sweetie, but that's
a little over 100 miles from here.

60
00:09:37,445 --> 00:09:40,551
Why don't you just tell me what happened?
Maybe we can get you a little help.

61
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,996
l woke up
in a dead box.

62
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,659
And a man tried to get me.

63
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:51,568
All right, all right.
Cindy's gonna know what to do.

64
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,835
Are you out of your mind?
We don't even know her.

65
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:57,399
She's probably one of them
crystal meth tweakers.

66
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:00,503
- Lower your voice.
- l will not lower my voice.

67
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,208
Have you seen
the way she's dressed?

68
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:04,716
lt wouldn't surprise me
if she was a prostitute.

69
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:07,117
Come on. She's pretty and all,
but l don't think--

70
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,781
Oh. Oh, she's pretty, is she?

71
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:13,686
l get it.

72
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,819
Cindy, don't go being judgmental.

73
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,558
Let's just go out and talk to her.

74
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:22,864
l need you to see if you can make
some sense out of her, okay?

75
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,666
Her old man probably
roughed her up is all.

76
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:45,580
Thank you.

77
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:50,856
Hey now. You must be--

78
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:54,230
l'm sorry, l didn't get your name.

79
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:58,299
Tucker tells me
he picked you up on the street,

80
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:01,739
that you were coming from a--

81
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:05,437
a cemetery? ls that right?

82
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,036
Wa-- water.

83
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:10,015
Oh, l'll get you some.

84
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:14,509
Listen, ma'am, l--

85
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,419
l heard what you said back there.

86
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,890
l'm sorry, l didn't mean it.
l just--

87
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:21,484
All l know is

88
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:24,052
my head hurts

89
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:26,656
real bad.

90
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,634
And l don't know where this is

91
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:32,604
or how l got here.

92
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:36,871
l can't think
of all the names, first off,

93
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,776
probably 'cause my head
hurts so bad.

94
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,781
l also know that l saw a man--

95
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,545
an old man get dead.

96
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:49,180
And another man tried to hurt me.

97
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,317
l woke up in a box also.
l don't know if he told you that.

98
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,755
So for all l know, l'm already dead.

99
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,630
Oh, who's dead?

100
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,769
l want to go to the police lady's
house now.

101
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,408
Oh, hon, all we got is that truck
and this genius here ran it out of gas.

102
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:20,715
We can use the telephone
and get more gas.

103
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,483
And then the police lady
can come get me.

104
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:25,616
Oh, sweetie, our phone got
cut off two months ago.

105
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,353
We didn't use it no how.

106
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,361
My brother will be here in the morning
with his truck.

107
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:31,693
No. No.

108
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,461
Somebody needs to know
about the old man.

109
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,128
Tucker: Well, you don't even know
where he was.

110
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:40,332
There's lots of cemeteries
around here

111
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,466
and my truck ain't got
but a couple of miles on him.

112
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:45,443
Look, l'll tell you what--
you take a shower.

113
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,208
We'll find you some clean clothes.
You can take a shirt of Tucker's

114
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,705
and l got some nice shoes.
They'll make you feel better, l promise.

115
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,878
And in the morning we'll take you
to the sheriffs.

116
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:56,354
You're safe here.
l'll even cook you breakfast.

117
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:58,323
You're safe here.

118
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:45,598
Still love me?

119
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,511
l love you more than anything.

120
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,021
l feel real mean about what l said
about her.

121
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,853
She's sweet.

122
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,656
l just hope to God
she leaves that guy.

123
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,253
Don't feel bad.

124
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,697
l think we're doing the right thing.

125
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:16,099
We're doing the Christian thing.

126
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:19,536
Just you keep it Christian.

127
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,006
Don't you go sneaking in there
when l'm asleep.

128
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,132
Yeah.

129
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,277
She definitely ain't dead.

130
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,294
Hey, baby girl.

131
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:52,668
l'm sorry.

132
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,570
Sorry.

133
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:58,635
Everything's gonna be fine,
l promise you.

134
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,703
lt's all gonna be okay.

135
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:28,749
Tucker: Hey.

136
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:36,258
Heard your foot tapping there, thought
you was dancing in here or something.

137
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:41,068
Let me take a look
at that back there.

138
00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:52,248
Ow. l'm sorry.

139
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:56,251
That's all right. No, l'm sorry.

140
00:15:59,212 --> 00:16:01,385
Be honest with us.

141
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:05,092
Did your old man do this to you?

142
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:12,899
Why did that man try to hurt me?

143
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:16,135
Some people's just rotten.

144
00:16:18,031 --> 00:16:20,033
They're just ruined right from the start.

145
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:23,013
We're gonna go to that station tomorrow.

146
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:25,038
l promise you, they gotta have
some sort of list

147
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,415
that shows people gone missing.

148
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,852
Hey, l got an idea.

149
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:32,584
Since you can't
remember your name,

150
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,614
why don't we
pick one out for you--

151
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:37,787
- just till you get yours back anyway?
- Okay.

152
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:42,357
Try real hard. Maybe you can recall
something from when you was little.

153
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,375
Princess Gemstone.

154
00:16:55,401 --> 00:17:00,146
l think l used to be friends
with Princess Gemstone.

155
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:03,120
All right, Princess.

156
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:08,114
Cindy should be whipping up breakfast
probably about 5:30.

157
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:09,649
You like bacon?

158
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,958
You're gonna like Cindy's bacon.

159
00:17:14,954 --> 00:17:17,366
Get yourself some rest, okay?

160
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,427
See you in the morning.

161
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:27,306
Hey, Cindy.

162
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:31,278
Cindy?

163
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:34,308
Cindy, come on.
l locked myself out.

164
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:43,517
Cindy?

165
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,790
Honey.

166
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:48,492
Oh, God Jesus.

167
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,632
No! Cindy!

168
00:17:56,329 --> 00:17:58,138
lt really hurts.

169
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:00,166
What do you want?

170
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:05,807
Tucker.

171
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:07,078
No.

172
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:09,313
No! No no.

173
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:12,084
He's gonna kill her.
He's gonna cut her.

174
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:15,024
What? God!

175
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:17,050
Take me. Kill me.

176
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,562
Kill me, you fuck.

177
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:28,262
No, please.
He's gonna kill us all.

178
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:30,900
No, don't look. No.

179
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:35,511
Please go. Go!

180
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:37,537
Don't look. Don't look.

181
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,243
Go go.

182
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:44,251
No! No!

183
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,070
Why are we out here, Johnny?

184
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:12,947
We could have stayed home
for some lovin'.

185
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:16,111
- His truck's gone.
- So?

186
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,948
Baby, l'm all emotional
and shit here.

187
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:25,721
What did you drag me out of bed
in the middle of the night for?

188
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,922
Look, l saw Tucker with some
black-headed girl

189
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:29,355
heading down Route 28.

190
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:32,359
You think he's cheating on Cindy?

191
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:34,855
l never figured Tucker for the type,

192
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,568
that lying sack of shit,

193
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:38,973
but l saw what l saw.

194
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,275
Now l gotta go in there,
l gotta wake my sister up and tell her.

195
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,978
Whose car is that?

196
00:19:45,738 --> 00:19:49,515
Crum-- crumskull?

197
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,352
Cromskill?

198
00:19:52,378 --> 00:19:53,914
Maybe it's his whore's.

199
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:06,830
Baby, why don't you wait till the morning
when y'all ride to work together?

200
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:10,363
Hold on, Jamie. l'm dying to know
who this bitch is.

201
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,738
Shit.

202
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:27,787
Hell, maybe l should see
who you've been texting, mister.

203
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:37,192
Baby, you'd never cheat on me now,
would you?

204
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:43,438
Baby, l would never
cheat on you.

205
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:44,770
And l never have--

206
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:22,562
l know this is the worst thing,

207
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:26,092
but we have to find a telephone

208
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,462
and call the police.

209
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:33,798
Oh, God.

210
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:42,148
Wherever we stop's
where we're gonna be.

211
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:46,354
All right?
lf there ain't nobody home,

212
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:50,055
they ain't got a phone,
we're fucked.

213
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,082
Please.

214
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:54,823
Please, next house.

215
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:04,636
Next house.

216
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:13,670
lt's kind of late, isn't it?

217
00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:15,945
We need a telephone.

218
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:17,850
Really fast.

219
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,856
l don't have a traditional landline
per se.

220
00:23:23,214 --> 00:23:24,993
But l have a computer.

221
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:30,158
Lock it.

222
00:23:32,189 --> 00:23:33,169
What?

223
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,163
Can that get us the sheriff?

224
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:38,834
Yeah, l can send an email.

225
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:43,675
Yeah, mail and tell them
to send all the cops.

226
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,941
The police, huh? What for?

227
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:52,447
His wife just died.

228
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:56,480
l'm so sorry.

229
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:59,153
l know how you feel.
My mother just passed.

230
00:23:59,182 --> 00:24:04,427
Did she get stuck
with a big knife?

231
00:24:04,654 --> 00:24:06,991
Did she get a knife st--? No.
No, she didn't--

232
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:09,504
ls that a question--?

233
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:13,997
A man with a shiny face--
he killed her

234
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:17,137
and an old man.

235
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,475
And he wants to--

236
00:24:18,502 --> 00:24:20,846
- He had a shiny face and he--
- He wants to make me dead.

237
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:23,613
Fantastic. Great. Okay.

238
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,280
Will it take long?

239
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,654
ln this golden age of technology,
who needs a telephone?

240
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:41,095
Actually, it might just take a minute.

241
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:03,213
"Do you have evidence
of insurance fraud

242
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:06,022
or fraud committed
by an insurance broker or carrier?

243
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:10,088
Do you suspect or know
of illegal terrorist or criminal activity?"

244
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,326
No, make it go down.

245
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:13,357
Okay, scrolling scrolling scroll--

246
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,301
"Are you an eyewitness to any crime?

247
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:17,430
Are you willing to
report what you know?"

248
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:19,338
Yeah yeah, go on,
send over one of them mails.

249
00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:20,706
Come on.

250
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:22,733
Okay.

251
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:25,975
"Help. Send many cops."

252
00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:36,114
Okay, it's sent.

253
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:39,822
What are you doing there?

254
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:42,458
l'm trying to find out
some more information

255
00:25:42,488 --> 00:25:44,092
about the guy.

256
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,764
You can find out about people
on this thing?

257
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:52,072
Let's see...
nothing on the "America's Most Wanted."

258
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:54,509
Here's a link to the FBl site.

259
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:57,670
Oh my God.

260
00:25:57,703 --> 00:26:00,149
What? What does it say?

261
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:02,516
l don't know.
l wonder if this is him.

262
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,988
The FBl believe over 30 women
from Florida, Georgia and Alabama

263
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:08,890
have all been taken
by this lunatic guy.

264
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:11,724
Yadda yadda yadda, "authorities believe
that the killer is Caucasian,

265
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,663
late '30s to early '40s,
probably an affluent citizen

266
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:17,395
like a doctor or a surgeon."

267
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:20,802
Well, if they ain't found them,
how do they know they're dead?

268
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,931
Did he happen to have
a video camera?

269
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,803
Something was blinking
on his shoulder.

270
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:30,110
lt's him.

271
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:32,081
Why do you reckon?

272
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:34,948
He videotaped all the girls' murders
and sent them to the police.

273
00:26:42,578 --> 00:26:41,489
Where was the last girl took from?

274
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:42,821
Miami.

275
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:48,856
Make this thing look
for missing girls in Miami.

276
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:28,471
Hey.

277
00:27:28,494 --> 00:27:30,872
You okay?

278
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:33,070
Yeah.

279
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:37,273
My stomach hurts.

280
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:39,543
l can't take all this death stuff
while l'm grieving.

281
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:42,745
- Stephen, you got a car?
- Of course.

282
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:44,846
l think we all go
to the sheriffs station.

283
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:47,187
lt could be too late by the time
city police get here.

284
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:50,557
No way. No way.
l'm not getting murdered tonight, thanks.

285
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:53,529
l got a funeral tomorrow.
l have a lot of stuff to do.

286
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:56,226
Someone has to stay here, right,
in case the cops come?

287
00:27:56,255 --> 00:27:58,428
l think we're safer in a group.
Trust me,

288
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:00,994
you don't want this guy to come knocking
with you here alone.

289
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,528
l understand.

290
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:05,235
Look, he's probably already seen
my truck by now.

291
00:28:05,264 --> 00:28:08,211
l think you're in this
whether you like it or not.

292
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,617
Can't this thing go any faster?

293
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:18,383
No no, l had an accelerator governor
put in for mother.

294
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,256
She was a bit of a speed demon.
lt won't go past 40.

295
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:28,162
That's it? That's all you got?

296
00:28:28,187 --> 00:28:30,793
We're at a police station.
Why are we getting weapons?

297
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:36,562
Get the tire stick.

298
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:39,508
And l got some tire sealant.
Maybe we can jam it in his ears.

299
00:29:01,331 --> 00:29:04,335
Hey, Sheriff Bates.

300
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,160
Stephen: Um, maybe--

301
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,998
Sheriff, are you there?
lt's Tucker Smith.

302
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,442
This is Sheriff Bates.

303
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:38,707
Yeah, Sheriff.
lt's me, Tuck.

304
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,545
l can hear you.

305
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:45,417
We got a crazy person here
and he's-- he's killed some folks.

306
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:47,115
We need help.
Do you copy?

307
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:50,613
l hit him with my car.
He killed my deputy.

308
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,991
l'm locked in the supply closet.

309
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:03,135
Um, l think you guys are good, so--

310
00:30:22,078 --> 00:30:24,080
Dead.

311
00:30:25,148 --> 00:30:27,628
They aren't all dead.

312
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:36,294
Sheriff.

313
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:37,805
That ain't Bates.

314
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:40,307
Sheriff, tell me where you're at.
We'll come get you.

315
00:30:41,564 --> 00:30:43,976
l'm locked in the supply closet.

316
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:48,472
l hit him with my car.

317
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:50,883
He killed my deputy.

318
00:30:52,075 --> 00:30:54,453
l can do it, Mom.

319
00:30:59,182 --> 00:31:03,995
This is Sheriff Bates.

320
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,931
Stephen: Hey. Hey, we're good.

321
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:08,094
There's no sheriff in here.

322
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:25,911
- Come on!
- Come on.

323
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:34,152
Come on.

324
00:31:38,054 --> 00:31:39,533
Hey!

325
00:31:41,324 --> 00:31:44,430
Tucker: No no no no!
God damn it!

326
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,445
Come on!

327
00:31:57,507 --> 00:32:01,387
Get back here.
Come on.

328
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:06,853
- Come on.
- He's coming. He's coming.

329
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:19,136
Princess: Go.

330
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,904
- Why did he have the camera?
- Just drive, Stephen.

331
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:26,379
l think we should go back
to his house

332
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,076
- and wait for the city cops to come.
- She's right. She's right.

333
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:31,381
You're both crazy.
He'll trap us in there.

334
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,478
- How much gas you got?
- About an eighth of a tank.

335
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,218
Let's head towards town.
We don't stop for anything.

336
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,817
No no, we don't have enough gas
for getting into town.

337
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:40,850
We can go to the holler.
We can make the market.

338
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:42,420
No, we head towards town.

339
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:46,525
Stop the car.
Stop the car.

340
00:32:46,556 --> 00:32:48,433
Stop the car now. Stop.

341
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:50,301
- No, we don't stop for nothing.
- Stop!

342
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:54,267
What?

343
00:32:54,297 --> 00:32:55,776
There.

344
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:59,079
That's where l'm from.

345
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:03,916
No no, l say we just keep on going.
There ain't no reason for us

346
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,352
to go inside there
and let him catch up with us.

347
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:12,053
l'm pretty sure l'd rather die and rot in hell
than go in there in these circumstances.

348
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:15,426
l have to remember something.

349
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,232
Stephen: Oh, Jeez.

350
00:33:26,596 --> 00:33:30,339
Roll down the window.

351
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:31,709
Hold up.

352
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,975
We can't let her go in there
by herself.

353
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:38,417
She ain't thinking right.

354
00:33:38,441 --> 00:33:41,217
l'm gonna sit here and keep a lookout.
You go with her.

355
00:33:42,712 --> 00:33:45,852
- Go on.
- l can't.

356
00:33:45,882 --> 00:33:47,088
Why not?

357
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:48,925
My ma's in there.

358
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:51,796
My ma's in there.
Her funeral is tomorrow--

359
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,823
today. l-- l--

360
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:56,666
l can't go in there
and see her like that.

361
00:33:56,693 --> 00:33:59,003
l can't see her
all sewn up like that.

362
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:02,373
l'll go with her.
l'm bleeding like a sieve anyway.

363
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,743
Pull the car around back.
Hide it.

364
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,454
Come on.

365
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,790
Come on, come on, come on.

366
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:39,363
Let's find someplace
to take a look at that arm.

367
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:44,229
He was right here on the door.

368
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:01,348
Good job, Princess.
l think you hurt him first.

369
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:24,507
Woman: l'm not dead!

370
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:28,276
Guys?

371
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:34,879
Why are you doing this to me?

372
00:35:36,443 --> 00:35:38,480
Who's there?

373
00:35:40,113 --> 00:35:41,387
Who's there?

374
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:46,423
All right, all right.

375
00:35:46,453 --> 00:35:48,899
Hold your arm there for me.

376
00:35:56,596 --> 00:35:59,042
You're gonna need
some stitches.

377
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:08,146
Where have
all the dead people gone?

378
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:11,313
l ain't got the foggiest.

379
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:22,132
He's gonna kill me, ain't he?

380
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:27,203
Hey, look at me.

381
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:30,639
Nobody--

382
00:36:31,664 --> 00:36:36,636
l mean, nobody else
is gonna die here tonight.

383
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:41,740
Yes.

384
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,464
Woman: l'm not dead.

385
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:59,799
You are too dead!
You leave me alone!

386
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,310
You're dead.

387
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,714
Mom, you're dead.

388
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,319
You're dead. You're dead.

389
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:28,859
Please don't scare me like that,
Mommy, please.

390
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:30,730
Hey.

391
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,754
Would you guys think l was crazy

392
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:54,755
if l told you that l saw
my dead mother

393
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:57,928
floating in a hearse out there?

394
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:03,497
Okay.

395
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,408
Hey.

396
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:52,017
Are you all right?

397
00:38:52,046 --> 00:38:55,789
l'm breathing.

398
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:01,296
l got me a pistol in the house.
l didn't even think to grab it.

399
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,592
l'm just so stupid,
so goddamn stupid.

400
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:09,403
Hey, it all happened so fast.

401
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,641
Maybe--

402
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:17,910
maybe l should have
stayed dead.

403
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:22,648
You wasn't dead, all right?
So stop saying that nonsense.

404
00:39:22,676 --> 00:39:25,282
And it's a coffin or a casket.
lt ain't--

405
00:39:25,312 --> 00:39:27,849
ain't no such goddamn thing
as a "dead box."

406
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:31,954
And dead people don't float around.
They're just fucking dead.

407
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:33,089
Hey, man.

408
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,600
l'm sorry, l just--

409
00:39:35,622 --> 00:39:37,932
l guess l'm still
kind of confused.

410
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,098
Well, snap out of it.

411
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:52,816
We just gotta hold on
a little more than three hours, okay?

412
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,377
Why? What happens then?

413
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:58,390
Well, my brother-in-law, for one--
he happens then.

414
00:39:58,412 --> 00:40:01,086
He's gonna be at my house
at 6:00 AM sharp.

415
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:03,117
But you're not there.

416
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,185
Right.

417
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:08,192
Just Cindy.

418
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:12,136
l can't-- l can't let him
see his sister like that.

419
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,503
We gotta go back.

420
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:16,371
We gotta cover her up.

421
00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:18,672
l really don't want
to leave here.

422
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:22,010
l feel like if l stay a bit

423
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:24,538
l might remember something.

424
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:28,178
And l'd rather not move, ever.

425
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:31,519
Well, all right then.
You stay here with the girl.

426
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:34,219
The keys are inside here.
l'm gonna lock that door.

427
00:40:34,248 --> 00:40:36,421
You make sure you don't open it
unless you know it's me.

428
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,935
Lock the door, please.

429
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:54,936
Great idea.
Make sure that's locked.

430
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,275
Whoa whoa.

431
00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:01,411
Princess, you're not thinking clearly.
That is not a good idea.

432
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:03,819
We've got a few weapons, right?

433
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:06,450
We've got the tire stick
that you hit him with.

434
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,426
The stupidest thing
l've ever done.

435
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:11,861
We've got the knife
that Tucker found in there.

436
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,731
And we have this.

437
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:20,964
Okay, fine. Fine.

438
00:41:20,994 --> 00:41:22,940
l don't understand.

439
00:41:22,963 --> 00:41:26,240
l think it's my turn
to take something from him.

440
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,921
He's strong. He's got a lot of stuff
to kill people.

441
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:48,956
l don't know,
l'd say he has the advantage,

442
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:51,697
not to mention the car
which helps him a lot.

443
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:54,433
And he's probably got
a lot of gas in it as well.

444
00:41:54,461 --> 00:41:57,499
Oh my God, what if he comes back
before Tucker does?

445
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:59,033
We'll be fine.

446
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:01,410
How? How?

447
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,014
Look,

448
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:08,645
you don't know
what it's like to wake--

449
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:12,179
wake up in that thing.

450
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:16,786
l must have a mom who loves me
and wants me home.

451
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:02,280
Stephen: lt's not Tucker, is it?

452
00:43:02,307 --> 00:43:05,151
Princess: No, it's him.

453
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:08,589
Stephen: He's been there all along.

454
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:10,684
Looks like we're gonna have to abort.

455
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:13,559
Flag on the play.
He's not coming in here.

456
00:43:13,585 --> 00:43:18,056
Princess: No, we're going in there.

457
00:43:24,696 --> 00:43:27,836
No. No. No.

458
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:19,725
Princess! Prin-- hey!

459
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:22,129
No no no no.
Over here. Over here.

460
00:44:23,588 --> 00:44:25,158
Me. Me.

461
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:27,362
Hey hey hey. Me.

462
00:44:27,392 --> 00:44:29,804
No no no. No!

463
00:44:42,173 --> 00:44:43,777
Princess!

464
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,421
Help me. Help me.

465
00:45:52,443 --> 00:45:54,548
He's coming. Please help me!

466
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:56,957
Help me, please. Please.

467
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:59,427
Please help me. Please.

468
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,794
He's coming.
Don't let him put me back.

469
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:04,527
Don't let him put me back.
l want to go home.

470
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:06,694
Shh.

471
00:46:06,724 --> 00:46:08,397
- Please help me.
- l'm sorry.

472
00:46:08,426 --> 00:46:10,303
- Help me!
- Shh.

473
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:16,805
No! No!

474
00:46:20,772 --> 00:46:22,479
l'm sorry. l'll get us help.

475
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:33,051
No. No.

476
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:35,121
Help!

477
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:38,999
Princess: No.

478
00:46:39,023 --> 00:46:40,764
No!

479
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:43,464
No!

480
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,257
No!

481
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:33,411
Princess?

482
00:47:48,926 --> 00:47:52,271
Woman: No!

483
00:47:52,296 --> 00:47:54,333
No!

484
00:49:51,335 --> 00:49:53,474
And there's these windows,
but they're kind of high up.

485
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:55,506
- l don't know where he is, so--
- All right.

486
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,350
All you had to do was watch her,
just keep her safe.

487
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:01,289
Don't blame me.
You're the one who yelled at her and left.

488
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:03,690
l don't know, she said she had to
take something.

489
00:50:03,714 --> 00:50:05,455
l don't know.

490
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:08,921
Come on, let's go.

491
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:22,644
Princess on tape: Are you from--?

492
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,977
Are you from the police?

493
00:50:49,994 --> 00:50:52,031
Son of a bitch.

494
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,222
Jesus Christ.

495
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:15,160
- Which one's she in?
- l don't know. l can't look.

496
00:51:27,565 --> 00:51:29,704
ls it her? ls it her?

497
00:51:29,734 --> 00:51:31,941
No. Sick motherfucker.

498
00:51:31,969 --> 00:51:33,971
Come on.

499
00:51:41,445 --> 00:51:43,356
Oh my God.

500
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:45,054
- Come on, back there.
- Back there?

501
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:47,028
You've got to be careful.
l don't know if you hit him.

502
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:49,292
l hit him at least once.

503
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,266
Well, then where is he?

504
00:51:51,289 --> 00:51:53,462
Oh, God help us.

505
00:51:54,592 --> 00:51:56,265
Stay alert.

506
00:51:57,295 --> 00:52:00,765
We're gonna find the girl first,
then we'll look for him.

507
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:02,903
This time l'll make sure
to put a bullet in his ass.

508
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,972
Jesus Christ.

509
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:09,609
Come on.

510
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:13,883
We're too late.

511
00:52:16,214 --> 00:52:18,216
- ls she dead?
- She's alive. She's alive.

512
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:20,786
Here, reload the gun.

513
00:52:21,886 --> 00:52:23,559
Hold on, girl.
We're coming.

514
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:38,078
Oh.

515
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:45,278
- Are you sure you hit him?
- l'm pretty sure.

516
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:46,879
Pretty sure?

517
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:00,800
Hey.

518
00:53:00,825 --> 00:53:03,567
Come on, come on.

519
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:06,336
- Hey, Princess.
- We thought we lost you.

520
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:13,806
Guys,

521
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:18,409
we're out of here.

522
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:21,482
Wow.

523
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,922
Oh, hey, here l am.

524
00:53:29,051 --> 00:53:31,463
Nobody's home.

525
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:46,643
- Oh, God.
- Look what l've found.

526
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:49,843
Fire that puppy up.
Call 911 .

527
00:53:49,872 --> 00:53:53,615
Heck, l'm calling everybody.
Are you kidding?

528
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:58,554
This is one of those Chinese ones,
'cause it's really advanced, really fancy.

529
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,026
lf you use--

530
00:54:02,985 --> 00:54:05,431
- Oh, sugar.
- What now?

531
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:07,456
lt needs some sort of a password
to make a call.

532
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:10,470
Jesus Christ. That figures.

533
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:14,507
- What do we do now?
- Die.

534
00:54:18,534 --> 00:54:22,311
No, D-l-E-- "die."

535
00:54:22,338 --> 00:54:24,818
- Good good.
- Okay okay.

536
00:54:26,575 --> 00:54:28,816
No, huh-uh.

537
00:54:29,945 --> 00:54:33,051
"Coffin" or "casket."

538
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:34,527
Good good good.

539
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,052
No.

540
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:39,032
No. Try the next one.

541
00:54:43,058 --> 00:54:45,060
No, still not good.

542
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:15,762
- l think l know what it is.
- All ears back here.

543
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:17,828
"Chrome skull."

544
00:55:26,568 --> 00:55:28,570
Craptacular.
That was a good one too.

545
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,903
"Thank you for contacting
the 911 emergency website.

546
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,432
Your emergency is important to us
and will be handled in the order

547
00:55:51,465 --> 00:55:54,002
it was received. lf this is a life-threatening
situation, please call 911

548
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:55,945
or your local law enforcement."

549
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:23,199
We may have a problem.

550
00:56:28,235 --> 00:56:30,237
Why don't we
just head towards town?

551
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,580
Hell, we got us a car. Ain't like he can
chase us now, right?

552
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:35,712
Yeah, but my car is there.
He can use that.

553
00:56:35,742 --> 00:56:39,986
l hope to God he does, 'cause just like us
he ain't gonna make it far in your car.

554
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:42,118
The smartest thing for us to do
is to go to Moreland's.

555
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,652
We can stock up on bullets.
We can use the phone

556
00:56:44,685 --> 00:56:46,528
and finally get some five-oh
on the way.

557
00:56:46,553 --> 00:56:49,432
Look, pop the trunk. Let me see
if there's anything else we can use,

558
00:56:49,456 --> 00:56:51,458
maybe another cell phone.

559
00:56:53,427 --> 00:56:55,930
Check the glove compartment too.

560
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:03,410
What do you see?

561
00:57:03,437 --> 00:57:05,041
Nothing good.

562
00:57:42,642 --> 00:57:44,815
Are you from the police?

563
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:56,662
Look here, it's not my fault.

564
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,034
l told you folks are starting
to complain

565
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:02,233
about the stink coming from there.
You understand me?

566
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:03,832
Do you know what l had
to tell Bates?

567
00:58:03,864 --> 00:58:06,811
l had to tell him l had no keys.
Do you know what he told me?

568
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:10,337
He'll be back in the morning.
He wants in.

569
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,509
You ain't gotta look, okay?

570
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:16,715
Okay, we just need
to lift these inside,

571
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,121
just get them inside.

572
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:20,887
All right?

573
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,418
And this shit--
this shit ain't part of the deal.

574
00:58:24,451 --> 00:58:25,953
You got it? Not at all.

575
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:29,365
l ain't never had one of them
jump at me,

576
00:58:29,389 --> 00:58:31,391
never, not in my house.

577
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,031
You're supposed to keep that shit
up there.

578
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,372
Women's voices: Bring her out.
l'll take care of the piggy.

579
00:58:38,398 --> 00:58:40,969
And the other piggy?

580
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:46,011
- Can you do this?
- l don't know if l can do this.

581
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:48,383
God damn you.
This is gonna cost you extra.

582
00:58:48,408 --> 00:58:51,878
lt's gonna cost you
a whole lot extra, you understand me?

583
00:58:51,912 --> 00:58:56,554
And l want you to get them all--
all off my land tonight.

584
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:59,086
God damn it.

585
00:59:14,034 --> 00:59:16,981
All right, now don't worry.
Don't worry.

586
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:20,576
l gotta get the right key.
l'll get you out of there, don't worry.

587
00:59:20,607 --> 00:59:24,111
- l just gotta find the right key.
- Hurry up.

588
00:59:37,257 --> 00:59:40,204
- Oh, God.
- Come on, pull it together, man.

589
00:59:40,227 --> 00:59:44,607
He cut my mother up. l saw my mom.
He cut my mom. He cut her all up.

590
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:47,510
How long is it gonna take
to get to the market?

591
00:59:47,534 --> 00:59:50,538
Please please, can't you see
what we're doing here?

592
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:51,810
Can't you give us a break?

593
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,614
We ain't going to that market,
all right?

594
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:56,917
We're gonna hold out here
until dawn.

595
00:59:56,943 --> 00:59:59,480
Then we're gonna drive to my house
and meet my brother-in-law.

596
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,959
He's got one of them phones
and it don't need a code to call.

597
01:00:01,982 --> 01:00:04,929
Come on, get ready.

One...

599
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,265
Tucker: Put the camera down.

600
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:12,327
Would you put the camera down
and get in the car?

601
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,033
lf you ain't gonna help out,
just be quiet

602
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:18,235
When l come back
l want that goddamn camera.

603
01:00:19,499 --> 01:00:21,877
Come on. Just don't look.

604
01:00:21,902 --> 01:00:25,315
- l can't do it.
- One, two, three.

605
01:00:34,648 --> 01:00:37,492
lt's all right.

606
01:00:37,517 --> 01:00:39,554
lt's dead anyway.

607
01:01:24,853 --> 01:01:27,299
Oh, no.

608
01:01:34,296 --> 01:01:36,742
Stephen: Where do you think
she's headed?

609
01:01:36,765 --> 01:01:39,644
Tucker: She seems fit to see
them pictures on that camera.

610
01:01:39,668 --> 01:01:42,171
Stephen: l don't think
that'd be a good idea.

611
01:01:42,204 --> 01:01:44,878
Tucker: Come on,
pick up the pace.

612
01:01:44,907 --> 01:01:46,784
lf we can make it back
to the funeral home

613
01:01:46,808 --> 01:01:48,845
your car should get us
down to the market.

You reckon she can find the market
with that dash map thing?

617
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,707
Yeah, most likely.

618
01:02:11,733 --> 01:02:16,148
Tucker: Does that mean
he can see where she's headed?

619
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:17,548

01:05:29,364 --> 01:05:32,277
Look at me. l'm a hot girl
in a nice car. Honk-honk.

641
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:34,177
Look at my tits.
Look at my tits.

642
01:05:34,202 --> 01:05:36,273
Look at me.
Honk-honk, honk-honk.

643
01:05:36,304 --> 01:05:38,341
l don't even know where we are
anymore, to be honest.

644
01:05:38,373 --> 01:05:40,683
Where we are? We are...

645
01:05:40,709 --> 01:05:44,816
gonna have a blast
at the fucking rave.

646
01:05:44,846 --> 01:05:47,122
- We need beer.
- Shit, beer.

647
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,948
Okay. Okay, l'll do it.

648
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:22,890
But l should take this one inside
to see what kind to get.

649
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,533
Women's voices: This little piggy
went to the market.

650
01:06:37,566 --> 01:06:39,045
This one stayed home.

651
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:47,696
l know, l know.
l'm sorry about the speed governor.

652
01:06:47,718 --> 01:06:49,720
lt's just l didn't want my mom
to get hurt.

653
01:06:49,754 --> 01:06:52,564
She would fly through the holler
like a bat out of hell.

654
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:56,265
l promise you, pedal to the metal,
we'll get there.

655
01:07:18,983 --> 01:07:21,224
You got any more
of these sixers?

656
01:07:21,252 --> 01:07:23,664
-Yeah, like a lot more.
-Yeah, l got lots,

657
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:26,191
but l can't sell you any of it.

658
01:07:26,223 --> 01:07:28,567
l got this.

659
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:32,039
No need to worry, my friend.
We have a lovely little lD.

660
01:07:32,063 --> 01:07:34,737
That ain't it.

661
01:07:34,765 --> 01:07:37,075
lt's the law.
Sunday-- no alcohol sales.

662
01:07:37,101 --> 01:07:41,379
So you're telling me it's a dry county
and you got booze for sale?

663
01:07:41,405 --> 01:07:44,011
lt ain't dry. lt's moist.

664
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:46,214
- Moist?
- What the fuck is moist?

665
01:07:46,243 --> 01:07:49,952
lt means we got rules.
l can get a big fine for that.

666
01:07:49,981 --> 01:07:53,861
All right, dude,
let's talk turkey, okay?

667
01:07:53,884 --> 01:07:56,694
l'm assuming that this place
is owned by your family, right?

668
01:07:56,721 --> 01:07:58,223
-Yeah, my daddy.
- His daddy.

669
01:07:58,255 --> 01:08:00,667
- Shut up. So where is he?

670
01:08:05,196 --> 01:08:07,836
- Come on, man.
- Excuse me.

671
01:08:07,865 --> 01:08:10,038
- l just--
- Hey, baby.

672
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:12,877
l saw you outside
trying to get our attention.

673
01:08:12,903 --> 01:08:16,578
Here's the thing-- we don't want
to get trashed in the car.

674
01:08:16,607 --> 01:08:19,349
Tommy and l are getting ready to go
to Hotlanta for an all-week rave.

675
01:08:19,377 --> 01:08:21,653
-You want to come with us?
- ...friends we're meeting there.

676
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,283
Your dad's never gonna
know about it, man.

677
01:08:23,314 --> 01:08:26,022
She wants to come with us.

678
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:29,520
That's great. l think we gotta put back
the fucking beer.

679
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,462
Howdy, ma'am.
How are you doing tonight?

680
01:08:40,664 --> 01:08:42,735
lt's been a hell of a night.

681
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:44,576
ls there anything
l can get for you?

682
01:08:44,602 --> 01:08:49,950
l'll take one of those
little videotapes.

683
01:08:49,974 --> 01:08:51,976
What for?

684
01:08:52,009 --> 01:08:55,252
You making a movie
or something?

685
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,281
Something like that.

686
01:08:57,314 --> 01:08:59,590
Well, is it gonna be
a good movie?

687
01:08:59,617 --> 01:09:03,326
l think that'll be it for me.

688
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:22,548
No.

689
01:09:22,573 --> 01:09:24,814
- Tommy: Oh, shit.
- Princess: No no no.

690
01:09:24,842 --> 01:09:26,378
You shouldn't go.
You can't go out there.

691
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:28,822
What's going on?
What the fuck is happening?

692
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:30,582
Princess: Don't go.

693
01:09:30,675 --> 01:09:32,780
Shit.

694
01:09:34,078 --> 01:09:37,753
This here is private property,
so why don't you get the fuck off?

695
01:09:37,782 --> 01:09:39,784
-You gotta go. You gotta go now.
- No no.

696
01:09:39,817 --> 01:09:41,763
- Just leave me.
- Tell me what's going on. What happened?

697
01:09:43,855 --> 01:09:45,698
What do you think
you're doing, huh?

698
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:49,837
Anthony, go call the cops.
Call the cops, come on.

699
01:09:51,362 --> 01:09:54,002
lt's okay. lt's okay.
lt's all right. lt's all right.

700
01:09:54,031 --> 01:09:55,533
Did you get 'em?

701
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,143
l don't know what he looks like.
He's got a mask on.

702
01:10:05,443 --> 01:10:07,116
What are you doing?

703
01:10:07,145 --> 01:10:09,625
- Lock the door. Lock the door.
- Do it.

704
01:10:09,647 --> 01:10:12,651
Are you after that girl right there?
You think you're going in there to get her?

705
01:10:12,683 --> 01:10:14,287
ls that what you think?

706
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,190
How's the dude gonna
get back in?

707
01:10:17,221 --> 01:10:19,724
What do you not understand?
l will shoot you in the head.

708
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:20,895
He's not.

709
01:10:22,226 --> 01:10:23,603
Oh, shit.

710
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:38,280
- Hey, where are you going?
- Checking to see if that's the only way in.

711
01:10:38,309 --> 01:10:39,583
Hurry up.

712
01:11:13,277 --> 01:11:15,279
No no no, please don't go, please.

713
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:17,452
Shh. Anthony?

714
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:20,394
Anthony, are you all right?

715
01:11:25,089 --> 01:11:27,797
Princess, let me in.

716
01:11:29,026 --> 01:11:30,096
Anthony?

717
01:11:38,769 --> 01:11:40,976
Me and Anthony-- we passed these guys
down the road.

718
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:43,611
l don't trust them.
We shouldn't let them in.

719
01:11:43,641 --> 01:11:45,314
l trust them. Let them in.

720
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,220
- Are you sure?
-Yes.

721
01:11:47,245 --> 01:11:49,657
- Princess, let us in.
- Princess?

722
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,126
Princess, let us in.

723
01:11:57,154 --> 01:12:00,135
l'm so sorry.
l was so stupid.

724
01:12:00,157 --> 01:12:02,159
What were you thinking, eh?

725
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:03,433
- Who the hell are you?
- What?

726
01:12:03,461 --> 01:12:04,997
- ls that your car out there?
-Yes.

727
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,906
You passed us on the street.
Why didn't you stop for us?

728
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:10,344
Look at you. Would you stop?
You're walking with a fucking tire iron.

729
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:13,577
- ls that your friend out there?
- No.

730
01:12:13,604 --> 01:12:15,606
Shit. Anthony?

731
01:12:17,575 --> 01:12:19,680
l'm so sorry.
l'm sorry about the car.

732
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,712
lt's all right. lt's okay.

733
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:45,076
Anthony's gone.

734
01:12:45,102 --> 01:12:48,640
There's just a lot of blood.

735
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,154
And this.

736
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:05,096
We called the cops,
so they should be coming--

737
01:13:05,122 --> 01:13:07,932
Yeah? Let me know
how that works out for you.

738
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:13,198
Listen up, y'all. We gotta find
anything we can to hurt this fucker.

739
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,335
We're holding our ground.

740
01:13:15,366 --> 01:13:18,575
Someone would be coming up
pretty quick. The cops known we're here.

741
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:20,513
l think it's our best chance.

742
01:13:38,055 --> 01:13:41,195
Look, man, l can't find anything.
All l got is this tire sealant.

743
01:13:49,033 --> 01:13:51,172
They ain't got no .45s.

744
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:02,448
Hey, this is cyanoacrylate.

745
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,926
ls it good?

746
01:14:04,949 --> 01:14:08,590
The superest of all glues,

747
01:14:08,619 --> 01:14:10,724
invented during the war

748
01:14:10,755 --> 01:14:13,235
to glue soldiers' wound together.

749
01:14:15,259 --> 01:14:17,170
When l was 18
l was building a tank model

750
01:14:17,194 --> 01:14:19,697
and a tiny drop of this fell on my leg
and it burned and smoked

751
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:23,143
like nobody's business.
Then it fused a piece of my PJs to my leg.

752
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,805
How did you get it off?

753
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:27,509
A doctor had to cut it off.

754
01:14:27,538 --> 01:14:29,575
l still have the scar.

755
01:15:02,406 --> 01:15:04,977
Girl's voice: You didn't tell me
you were making a movie.

756
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,582
Stephen: Shit.

757
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:23,561
- No, don't.
- lt's okay.

758
01:15:44,181 --> 01:15:45,660
Shit.

759
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:55,392
No no no, you'll hit the ammo.

760
01:15:59,363 --> 01:16:01,365
You go around front now.

761
01:16:01,398 --> 01:16:03,344
And don't you leave
till she comes out that door.

762
01:16:07,905 --> 01:16:10,351
Aw, screw it. Cover your eyes.

763
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:15,518
No!

764
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,101
- Go with the kid.
- No.

765
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,300
- Go with the kid.
- No.

766
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:34,331
- Go on, go.
- No.

767
01:16:34,365 --> 01:16:37,346
No, you tried
and he's not gonna stop,

768
01:16:37,368 --> 01:16:39,609
ever. Just let me go.

769
01:16:40,938 --> 01:16:43,043
Just let me go.

770
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:48,417
lf things don't go my way,
you're somebody great.

771
01:16:51,115 --> 01:16:53,288
Don't you forget that again.

772
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,828
No.

773
01:17:07,464 --> 01:17:09,501
No.

774
01:17:16,373 --> 01:17:17,374
No.

775
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,820
Oh, God.

776
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:31,793
No!

777
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:48,414
No.

778
01:17:51,475 --> 01:17:53,785
No no no.

779
01:17:53,811 --> 01:17:54,949
No.

780
01:18:20,004 --> 01:18:21,813
l know who you are.

781
01:18:21,839 --> 01:18:24,183
l know your name.

782
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:26,518
Hey, guys, come on.

783
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:05,692
Nice place.

784
01:19:05,715 --> 01:19:08,628
You buy or lease?

785
01:19:08,652 --> 01:19:12,896
Hey, you don't mind if l use your bed
before we use your bed, do you?

786
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:19,204
Not much of a talker, are you?

787
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:24,701
You don't mind?

788
01:19:38,215 --> 01:19:40,217
Come here.

789
01:19:42,285 --> 01:19:44,731
Come a little bit closer.

790
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:50,365
l'm not gonna hurt you.

791
01:19:52,462 --> 01:19:56,205
Now l know you only paid
for a blowjob,

792
01:19:56,233 --> 01:19:58,736
but don't you want
a little bit more?

793
01:19:58,768 --> 01:20:01,840
Have you ever had
a Swedish blowjob?

794
01:20:11,748 --> 01:20:14,024
Hey...

795
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,663
you didn't tell me
