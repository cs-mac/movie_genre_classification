1
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:29,041
Jesus, that is loud.

2
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:30,768
I'd call and complain, too.

3
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:34,125
Neighbors also said
there was screaming.

4
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,146
It's the police!

5
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:06,448
Hey, shouldn't we
wait for backup?

6
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:07,407
You wait.

7
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,862
Are you
checkin' this out?

8
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,445
Now!

9
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:49,802
- Police!
- Freeze!

10
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:51,720
Ma'am?

11
00:02:51,816 --> 00:02:53,446
You all right?

12
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,680
Is she alone in here?

13
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:00,927
Ma'am?

14
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,874
Oh, my God.

15
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,081
What the f...

16
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:10,327
Blaine!

17
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:42,362
Officer...

18
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:45,433
Officer down.

19
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:08,644
Move it back, people!

20
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,329
Please. Step back.
Move back.

21
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:13,536
Ready to go live
in three...

22
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:14,495
two...

23
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,454
And one.

24
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,084
It's... it's
indescribable.

25
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,906
This... This horrific
crime scene

26
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,921
where a rookie officer
has been savagely

27
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:23,031
hacked to death at this
dilapidated residence.

28
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:24,565
...in what
authorities have described

29
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,388
as a gruesome crime scene,

30
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:28,306
two officers entered
this abandoned building

31
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,457
earlier this afternoon.

32
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:31,759
What they found inside
is simply too grisly...

33
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,581
The young officer
who lost his life

34
00:04:33,678 --> 00:04:35,404
in this attack
has not been identified

35
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,034
pending notification
of next of kin.

36
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,377
Williams risked his own life

37
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:40,296
to rescue the young woman
being held hostage

38
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:42,022
on the premises.
So far, the remains...

39
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:44,132
So far, seven human
remains have been unearthed,

40
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:46,242
all with the eyes
grotesquely removed

41
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,449
in what police are saying
is one of the most diabolical...

42
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:50,463
The only possible clue
to the horrendous acts

43
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,381
which occurred here today
lay in the hands

44
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:54,107
of two very shaken
survivors.

45
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:55,930
14-year police veteran
Frank Williams

46
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:57,752
is the only surviving officer.

47
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:00,054
He's being taken from the scene
with severe injuries,

48
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,205
and at this point,

49
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,643
his condition
is listed as critical.

50
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,754
...for any clues
they can provide.

51
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,837
...female victim,

52
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,372
who was brutally blinded.

53
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:12,714
...will be consulted

54
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,345
as numerous unsolved mysteries
may be laid to rest

55
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:15,592
with these tragic...

56
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,607
Investigators
are anxious to question

57
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:19,429
Sergeant Williams
and the female...

58
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:20,867
For now, both will be rushed

59
00:05:20,964 --> 00:05:22,498
to Overland General
for psychiatric evaluation

60
00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:24,032
and trauma care.

61
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:26,526
Stay tuned
to this developing story as...

62
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,459
- Hey, Russell.
- What, dude?

63
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,104
Check this out, bro.

64
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:31,173
I don't need to.

65
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:32,324
Help a white boy out.

66
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:33,283
Sweet.

67
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,818
Keep it down back there.

68
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:38,270
Gentlemen,
can we move it?

69
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,189
How many more miles?

70
00:06:40,286 --> 00:06:41,245
Richie, please.

71
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,026
Shut up, man.

72
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:51,123
I found these condoms.

73
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,577
Why are you
looking at me? God.

74
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:56,015
Busted.

75
00:06:57,454 --> 00:07:00,139
We need to be able
to trust you guys.

76
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,729
This is the first coed
program of its kind.

77
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,840
So, again...

78
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:06,278
no fraternizing.

79
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:10,115
Melissa?

80
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:11,841
Melissa!

81
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:15,678
Ma'am?

82
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:17,116
She's the last person

83
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,651
you've got to worry about.

84
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:20,570
You bitch.

85
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,584
Oh, my God.
The mute spoke.

86
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,406
Watch your ass, slut.

87
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,475
What, like the way
you watch Kira's?

88
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,298
Dyke.

89
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:30,257
Ladies.

90
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:36,012
They're here.

91
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:41,862
Bunch of losers.

92
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,589
Hope they had their shots.

93
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:48,672
Zo, pass me
my bag, please.

94
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,167
Sure.

95
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:56,730
Thanks.

96
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:03,155
Dude, you better
back up off me.

97
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,649
I just about had
enough of your shit.

98
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:06,705
Oh, my God.

99
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,239
Move me, boy.

100
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,774
- What?
- Son of a bitch.

101
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,308
I got your boy.
I'm'a show...

102
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:12,364
Let's go, shithead.

103
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,419
- Hey!
- "Boy," huh?

104
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,529
You two knock it off.

105
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,967
I said knock it off!

106
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:17,927
Fuckface.

107
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:19,461
You'd rather stay here?

108
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:21,668
Go back inside?

109
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:22,723
Now, get goin'.

110
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:27,710
Hey, Frank.

111
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,724
I thought my group
was animals.

112
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,930
Those two gonna make it?

113
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:33,176
We'll see.

114
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:35,287
Hello, ladies.

115
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:36,726
Don't sit next to me.

116
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:38,164
What are you lookin' at?

117
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:53,031
Hello, everyone.
I'm Hannah Anders.

118
00:08:53,128 --> 00:08:54,950
This is Frank Williams.

119
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:56,868
You guys know that
your hard work this weekend

120
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,786
will pay off
in shorter sentences.

121
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:01,664
I hope you can prove to us
that we made the right decision

122
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,294
in choosing you
for this program.

123
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:05,884
What's up,
squeaky tweaker?

124
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,322
Fuck you, Mike.

125
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:11,735
Been there.
Done that.

126
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:14,132
I used to hit that shit.

127
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:15,667
Is that what you call it?

128
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,010
What, I say somethin'?

129
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,408
Dumb-ass.

130
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:20,750
You talkin' to me, Rufus?

131
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:22,093
- Yeah.
- You know what?

132
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,724
You might want to move.

133
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,808
Hey!

134
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:30,726
- Oh my God.
- Hey!

135
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:32,452
Break it up back there!

136
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:34,083
I said break it up.

137
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,672
What? I didn't do shit.

138
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:39,070
I don't care. Act up again,

139
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,989
we turn around.

140
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,811
That goes for all of you.

141
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:48,183
God, his hand.
What happened to him?

142
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,621
You mean the claw?

143
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:50,677
Leprosy.

144
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:52,019
I heard Chihuahua attack.

145
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:02,378
Hey, you're, like, the dog
pound liberator, huh?

146
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:04,296
Dog pound liberator?

147
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:06,886
Yeah. They were
gonna gas 'em.

148
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,709
Nice move, though.

149
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:13,599
I respect that.

150
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:19,739
I'm gonna need drugs.

151
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,465
I heard that.

152
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:22,999
Where the fuck
are they taking us?

153
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:31,153
Yo, Tye.

154
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:35,469
- Tye.
- Come on, man.

155
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:36,907
Can't a brother
get some rest?

156
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,730
Look, I might had
a proposition for you.

157
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:41,223
For me.

158
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,183
Yeah.

159
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:46,499
I'm listenin'.

160
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:56,762
Okay, everyone, this is it.

161
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:00,790
Damn.

162
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,421
What is this? Hotel Ghetto?

163
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:04,339
Like you'd know.

164
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:06,928
I thought my 'hood was bad.

165
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,684
Mr. Williams.

166
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,890
I'm so glad this worked out.

167
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:15,945
Me, too, Margaret.

168
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,383
Thanks for the opportunity.

169
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,590
How's our first group?

170
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:20,741
Not so good.

171
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:23,043
Some a little worse than others.

172
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:27,167
We left County for this?

173
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:28,126
'Scuse me.

174
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:30,811
Let's go.

175
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:33,785
Slave labor bullshit.

176
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,144
Oh my God.

177
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,829
What a dump.

178
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:48,844
Damn!

179
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,721
Smelled better on the bus.

180
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:53,063
I wonder if there's cable.

181
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,023
Knock it off.

182
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:56,037
Good afternoon, everyone.

183
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,531
I'm Margaret Gaine.

184
00:11:58,627 --> 00:11:59,969
I'm involved in the renovation

185
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,272
of historical landmarks.
This property

186
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:04,765
was donated to us
a few years ago.

187
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:07,739
We toyed with the idea
of reopening the hotel,

188
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:09,945
but honestly,
what this part of town

189
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,822
really needs is a shelter
for the homeless.

190
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,412
That's where
you guys come in.

191
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:16,371
What, homeless?

192
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:17,714
No, dear.

193
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,960
Volunteers.

194
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:19,920
We didn't volunteer.

195
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:20,783
Dude.

196
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,414
Can't you ever
fuckin' shut up?

197
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,373
Eat me.

198
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:25,195
Oh, yeah.
Good comeback.

199
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,538
Fuck you.

200
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:28,456
Uh, what museum...

201
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:30,279
did you say you
work for, granny?

202
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,389
Guys. You know the tradeoff

203
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,595
for three days' work
is a month off your sentence.

204
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:35,746
That's not a bad deal.

205
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:42,172
Let me tell you somethin'.

206
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,091
Hannah and I are
here on a weekend

207
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:46,584
because we believe
in second chances.

208
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:47,927
Don't prove us wrong.

209
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,846
For the next three days,
if Margaret asks you

210
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:51,764
to do somethin',
you better do it.

211
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,819
You got it?

212
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:56,751
Who wants a tour?

213
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,547
- Mr. Blackwell built the hotel
- I can't believe this.

214
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,945
as a playground for
himself and his friends.

215
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,151
Rumor has it that there
are hidden passageways

216
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:07,493
and two-way mirrors all over,

217
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,316
although I've never found them.

218
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,331
We've almost finished
renovating the suites

219
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:12,386
on the second floor.

220
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:14,016
That's where
you'll all be staying.

221
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:16,126
Penthouse floors, however,
on eight and nine

222
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:18,524
are off-limits.
It's too dangerous for guests.

223
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,483
Why? What happened?

224
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,730
There was a fire in '71.

225
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:21,689
It gutted them.

226
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:23,224
It killed Mr. Blackwell,
his wife,

227
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,470
and a few others.

228
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:27,540
And since the hotel was

229
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:29,074
more of a hobby
than a business,

230
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:31,568
it's never been repaired.

231
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:33,391
Besides, we don't
want your parents

232
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:35,405
suing us if you
get hurt, now, do we?

233
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:39,434
Oh. Before I forget.
During mealtimes,

234
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,544
you all can eat
in the atrium.

235
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,229
However, the doors must
remain locked at night.

236
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:46,915
So. Ladies...

237
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:48,066
grab a trash bag.

238
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,176
Gentlemen, brooms.

239
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:51,614
Michael, is it?

240
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:53,821
Yeah. You want me
to be shot caller?

241
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,410
No. No, we want you to mop.

242
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:57,945
The lavatory's over there.

243
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:00,727
Your heard her, Mike.
Get the mop.

244
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,229
Hey, I'm tryin'
to clean here!

245
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:45,232
Cut it out!

246
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:08,731
Oh, sh...

247
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,183
Hello?

248
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,173
Hello?

249
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,681
- Shh!
- You scared me!

250
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,695
Keep your voice down.

251
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,491
Did you open that?

252
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:37,984
Yeah. I'm gettin'
the fuck outta here.

253
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,288
What?

254
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,316
This only leads out
to the atrium.

255
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,810
You'd still be
inside the hotel.

256
00:15:57,647 --> 00:15:58,893
Jesus!

257
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,155
Nice try, though.

258
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:05,896
Come on, don't let
Michael get to your head.

259
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:07,622
You don't understand.

260
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:10,595
Where'd you get those?

261
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:13,569
What's-her-name.
She lifted 'em off Hannah.

262
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:15,679
Oh. Zoe.

263
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,172
Yeah. Zoe.

264
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:22,105
I just can't believe
the same asshole

265
00:16:22,202 --> 00:16:23,257
that got me locked up

266
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:24,695
is gonna be sleepin'
down the hall.

267
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,325
You know?

268
00:16:26,422 --> 00:16:27,381
I know.

269
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:33,807
Can I have one?

270
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:36,493
Shit.

271
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:39,754
We were just...

272
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,936
Thanks, girls.

273
00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:04,020
Try not to burn
the place down.

274
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:05,842
Yes, sir.

275
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:09,104
Okay.

276
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:17,065
You think he whacks off
with that thing?

277
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,024
Definitely.

278
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,013
Tye.

279
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,643
What's up?

280
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,178
All that, uh,
all that stuff

281
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:34,138
about the hidden rooms,

282
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:36,440
the passages,
the stairwells?

283
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:38,166
All true.

284
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:40,468
This is what I was
talkin' about on the bus.

285
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,949
So what?

286
00:17:48,046 --> 00:17:50,635
Okay. This is
where you come in.

287
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:51,881
Can you crack a safe?

288
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:53,320
Please. Open 'em
like I open

289
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:54,951
your mama's legs.

290
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,965
Good, 'cause
there is a safe.

291
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:58,021
Here.

292
00:17:58,117 --> 00:17:59,555
Blackwell's private stash.

293
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:00,897
Never been recovered.

294
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:01,857
Why not?

295
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:03,679
No one knows about it.

296
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:06,269
I mean, this place
is a goddamn maze, but...

297
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:07,420
I got the blueprints.

298
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:09,434
Look, man, I'm not tryin'
to get no more time.

299
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,585
You won't.
You won't. Look,

300
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,407
if we get caught wandering,
you know, we just say...

301
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,230
we got lost.

302
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,764
It's simple.

303
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:17,107
And this shit is current.

304
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:19,314
'Course it is. I mean,
why wouldn't it be?

305
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,232
You tellin' me
after 35 years

306
00:18:21,328 --> 00:18:23,534
no one's found
this so-called safe?

307
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,931
Have you got anything else
better to do?

308
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,439
All right, Richie-Rich.
I'm down.

309
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:58,063
What?

310
00:18:58,159 --> 00:18:59,022
I'm working.

311
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,557
I didn't say anything.

312
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm glad you were cleared
for this project, Christine.

313
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:07,079
Out of everyone here,

314
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:09,093
I think you've got
the most potential.

315
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,340
Do you, now?

316
00:19:10,436 --> 00:19:12,546
I've seen everyone's file.

317
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:14,369
I know your story.

318
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:16,671
Why you attacked
your stepfather...

319
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,205
what happened
to your sister.

320
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:20,986
You got a shitty deal.

321
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,454
Yeah.

322
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:30,578
Actually, speaking
of shitty deals...

323
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:32,593
whose bright idea was it
to put Kira and Michael

324
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:34,223
on this project together?

325
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,469
What are you talkin' about?

326
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:37,484
What I'm talking about

327
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,498
is Kira used
to work for that prick

328
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,417
- out on the streets.
- What?

329
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,198
Yeah... when he wasn't
beating her ass.

330
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:48,418
She rolled over on him,
and now because of you guys,

331
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:50,625
he's here, and he's been
fuckin' stalking her

332
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:51,776
- the whole time.
- Okay.

333
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:53,982
Okay. We didn't know.

334
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:56,859
I'll deal with it.

335
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,367
Yeah. You deal with it.

336
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,985
You'd get with her?

337
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,327
Absolutely.

338
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:12,589
What, you wouldn't?

339
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,603
Man, your standards
are too high.

340
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,056
What's up, bitch?

341
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:20,837
- I mean, uh... Rich.
- Come on.

342
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,085
You didn't stick your tongue
in this, did you?

343
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:23,619
Yes, as a matter of fact.

344
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:29,470
I specifically asked
for no meat.

345
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:33,978
The granola girl's
on a rampage.

346
00:20:34,074 --> 00:20:36,663
Shoulda left her tofu-munching
ass back in County.

347
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,980
Hey, uh, you want
my potato salad?

348
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:42,322
Oh, that's sweet.
Thanks.

349
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,625
"That's sweet. Thanks."

350
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:49,228
Ass.

351
00:20:50,476 --> 00:20:52,394
Oh, the poor thing.

352
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,696
Here. Come here, puppy.
Want some food?

353
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,546
Here you go.

354
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:02,369
Fucking moron!

355
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:03,520
What?

356
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:06,493
- He's starving!
- What?

357
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:08,315
It's a fucking stray dog.
Who gives as shit?

358
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:18,579
She wasn't that fat.

359
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,017
You got that shit?

360
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:26,060
Hey. How about
a peace offering?

361
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:27,786
You can pimp it up
in the penthouse.

362
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:31,048
Home-grown aspirin?

363
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,774
Hell, yeah.

364
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,611
How about it, granola girl?

365
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:37,953
It's organic.

366
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:40,542
Bring it on.

367
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,245
Hey.

368
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:53,971
Do you think,

369
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:57,040
veggie girl...
you know...

370
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:58,959
likes tube steak?

371
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:00,014
Dude.

372
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,548
You'll never know,
will you?

373
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:04,042
But I'll let you smell
my fingers later.

374
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:08,550
You two
aren't partying?

375
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,674
Pussies.

376
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,787
Rich pussies.

377
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:27,253
This better work,
Richie-Rich.

378
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,364
Michael?

379
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,378
You asshole.

380
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:38,231
How the fuck did
you get in here?

381
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,245
You should be
used to me comin'

382
00:23:40,437 --> 00:23:41,587
through the back door.

383
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:43,698
Get out!
Get the fuck outta here!

384
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:44,849
Jesus Christ, bitch...

385
00:23:44,945 --> 00:23:46,287
No! Get out now!

386
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,932
Hey! Let her go!

387
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,371
And what if I don't?

388
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:52,809
I said...

389
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:55,303
fucking let her go. Now.

390
00:24:01,826 --> 00:24:04,127
You bitches.

391
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:08,540
Fucking asshole.

392
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:09,499
You okay?

393
00:24:10,938 --> 00:24:12,280
Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

394
00:24:17,077 --> 00:24:18,036
I'm sorry.

395
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:31,560
This one.

396
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:36,067
Damn. It's locked.

397
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:45,275
Nice.

398
00:24:56,114 --> 00:24:57,936
Wow. All this for Russell?

399
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,156
He's interested in my views.

400
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:04,363
Is that why he keeps
lookin' at your ass?

401
00:25:05,705 --> 00:25:09,541
My girl even shaved
her furry legs for this guy.

402
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:11,940
Yeah, well, I was
getting a little sick

403
00:25:12,132 --> 00:25:13,474
of the natural look anyway.

404
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:16,255
If lookin' like a Hobbit is natural.

405
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,859
So, you guys coming?

406
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:26,807
Come on. Let's go.

407
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:38,508
Thanks.

408
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:40,906
Nice rock.

409
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:43,016
Thank you.

410
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,989
Why is it on your right hand?

411
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:50,401
I'm, test-driving it.

412
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:54,142
I haven't given him
an answer yet.

413
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:57,500
Why?

414
00:25:57,595 --> 00:25:58,745
He's decent, right?

415
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:01,240
Yeah.

416
00:26:01,336 --> 00:26:03,062
Got all his own teeth?

417
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,885
Yeah.

418
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:08,145
What are you waiting for?

419
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:15,243
Man! You... you smell that?

420
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,737
Bet no one's been up here
since the fire.

421
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:20,327
I think you're wrong, dawg.

422
00:26:20,423 --> 00:26:22,916
Yeah. Yeah,
maybe I'm wrong.

423
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:31,165
Why would they leave
all this here?

424
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:32,508
Maybe they found
the safe,

425
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:34,714
got rich, and didn't
need this shit no more.

426
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:41,044
Check him out.

427
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,634
Yeah.

428
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:45,361
He's dead.

429
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:46,416
No shit.

430
00:26:46,512 --> 00:26:47,854
Probably from the fire.

431
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:49,581
The fire was 30 years ago.

432
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,978
This guy's fresh.
He wasn't killed in the fuckin' fire.

433
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:53,705
Stop freakin' out
on me. All right?

434
00:26:53,802 --> 00:26:57,063
Maybe he's got
some money on him.

435
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,405
You never know.

436
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:05,790
Where the fuck are his eyes?

437
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:12,216
Richie! Where
you goin'? Richie!

438
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,095
Richie!

439
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:26,412
What the h...

440
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:33,126
Richie! Where
the hell are you?

441
00:27:34,374 --> 00:27:35,716
Richie!

442
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:53,940
Help!

443
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:57,393
Help!

444
00:27:58,832 --> 00:27:59,695
No!

445
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,805
Help me! Please!

446
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:17,151
There's someone
in the elevator.

447
00:28:17,248 --> 00:28:18,686
They must've
left their rooms.

448
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:20,987
I'll get this one.

449
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:54,846
I guess I'm not
waiting on anything.

450
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,068
Come on.

451
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:16,427
Hello?

452
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:18,345
Anybody here?

453
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:10,427
So, why didn't
Christina come?

454
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:13,208
I don't know. She probably
wanted to make out with Kira.

455
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:16,086
Why do homeless people
live here? It's disgusting.

456
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:18,963
What's that?

457
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,265
Opportunity knocking.

458
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,951
Or granny and her vibrator.

459
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:25,581
That was pathetic.

460
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:31,528
He's only gonna get worse.

461
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,844
I gotta get outta here.

462
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:42,751
The windows
in the kitchen

463
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:43,997
face out toward
the atrium.

464
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,052
Yeah, but don't they have...

465
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:46,875
No. No bars.

466
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,752
There's an opening
in the wall.

467
00:30:54,932 --> 00:30:56,466
It's gotta lead
somewhere, right?

468
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,385
Dog got out.

469
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,155
Okay. I'll stay out here.

470
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:14,594
The hole's
on the far wall

471
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:15,840
in the atrium.

472
00:31:15,937 --> 00:31:18,334
If you stay low,
you should make it.

473
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:19,965
I wish you'd
come with me.

474
00:31:20,062 --> 00:31:20,925
Just go.

475
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,665
- Okay.
- Okay?

476
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:28,214
Be careful.

477
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:30,420
Okay, go.

478
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:35,547
The kitchen.

479
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:39,574
What happened?

480
00:32:39,671 --> 00:32:42,836
I'm okay.
Just keep Williams out.

481
00:32:42,932 --> 00:32:44,082
Right.

482
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:49,454
Michael?

483
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,988
Why can't you
just leave me al...

484
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:56,743
Shit.

485
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,763
- Damn it.
- Kira!

486
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:24,271
Help!

487
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:28,683
Where does this lead to?

488
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:29,929
It goes to every floor.

489
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:31,368
Who else is in the hotel?

490
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:33,862
Nobody. We cleared the homeless
out before you got here.

491
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:36,165
Go make sure everybody else
is still in their rooms.

492
00:33:36,261 --> 00:33:38,658
Wait! Everyone else
went to the penthouses.

493
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:40,193
- That's off limits!
- Damn it!

494
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:51,415
Shit.

495
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:54,484
Call 911. Anyone comes down,
get 'em out of the building fast.

496
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:56,019
I'm coming with you.

497
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:58,225
Forget it. You wait
here for Hannah.

498
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:04,748
What are you doin'?

499
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,185
I said I'm coming with you.

500
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:08,008
Come on, hurry up!

501
00:34:11,558 --> 00:34:13,476
What happened to you?

502
00:34:13,572 --> 00:34:14,435
What?

503
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:18,847
Nothing. That...
that's not even my...

504
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:24,122
What the fuck is going on?

505
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:32,083
Anyone for some
interior redecorating?

506
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,425
Oh, shit!

507
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:35,823
You're gonna get us
caught, asshole!

508
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,166
Fuck.

509
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:41,482
By who? Captain Hook?

510
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,389
Hey!

511
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:55,773
Who needs therapy?

512
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,925
Fuck.

513
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,816
How many people
died up here?

514
00:35:08,915 --> 00:35:09,970
Stay close.

515
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:19,752
Damn. Damn.

516
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:23,493
Damn. Where in the hell
are stairs?

517
00:35:24,357 --> 00:35:26,083
Oh... shit!

518
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,497
Come on, baby.
Open up.

519
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:40,086
Come on.

520
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,280
He took Richie.

521
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:48,240
Calm down.

522
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:49,678
He took Richie!

523
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,733
What'd this guy look like?

524
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,364
Man, he's huge, man.

525
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,610
He has a long, long chain,

526
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,337
and a damn hole
in his head.

527
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,310
What?

528
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,900
No. It's not right.

529
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:05,792
It can't be him.
I shot him in the head.

530
00:36:05,888 --> 00:36:07,518
Holy shit.

531
00:36:07,615 --> 00:36:09,629
Wait a minute.
You shot that freak

532
00:36:09,725 --> 00:36:11,739
that plucked all
those people's eyes out.

533
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:15,287
Whoa. Wait. What the hell
does he want with Kira?

534
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:16,343
I'm not sure.

535
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:20,371
The last time,
he killed all of his victims except one.

536
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:22,481
I think he was keepin' her

537
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:24,015
because she had tattoos.

538
00:36:24,112 --> 00:36:27,469
Stuff like crosses...
religious markings.

539
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,195
Kira has religious tattoos

540
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,250
Ohhh... damn.

541
00:36:30,346 --> 00:36:32,072
You think he killed
everybody else?

542
00:36:32,169 --> 00:36:33,799
Didn't Margaret
call the police?

543
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:35,429
I don't know that she could.

544
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:37,827
We gotta move.

545
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:41,185
He let the other woman live.

546
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:43,774
Take this.
Take the stairs.

547
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,829
Whatever you guys gotta do,

548
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:46,844
just get the fuck outta here.

549
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,090
I'm goin' after Kira.

550
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:51,064
Wait a minute!

551
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,461
Wait! You can't
do this alone!

552
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:55,476
You guys gotta go!

553
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:57,010
Williams!

554
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,477
Williams! Shit!

555
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:06,122
Williams!

556
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,616
Oh, my God!

557
00:37:08,712 --> 00:37:10,150
Williams!

558
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:15,714
You think he got him?

559
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,577
Williams!

560
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:24,921
Shit!

561
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,183
Come on!
Christine, Come on!

562
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,238
We gotta go!

563
00:37:30,677 --> 00:37:31,827
No! Come on!

564
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,446
Leave him alone!
Come on!

565
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:42,474
What the hell
are you doin'?

566
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,296
Sorry.

567
00:37:47,462 --> 00:37:48,325
Come on!

568
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,450
Here. Take the Taser.

569
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:01,849
Far sweet.

570
00:38:11,729 --> 00:38:12,784
Nice.

571
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,373
Could you imagine
cleaning up in here?

572
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:20,553
This could've been
a classy joint

573
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:21,895
back in the day.

574
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:23,237
What do you know
about class?

575
00:38:24,293 --> 00:38:25,348
Oh my God.

576
00:38:25,444 --> 00:38:28,513
This place is disgusting.

577
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,872
At least we got
the sacred herb.

578
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:40,214
Spark that shit.

579
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:48,752
Let's go.

580
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:51,629
And one for me.

581
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,794
Try not to suck it all down.

582
00:38:58,247 --> 00:39:00,932
So, you and Kira used
to be a thing, huh?

583
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:19,828
You know, you could do better.

584
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,143
Here you go.

585
00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:38,914
I keep seeing things.

586
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:40,257
I told you
this shit is gold.

587
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,478
Let's find someplace private.

588
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,849
Oh, shit, you go girl!

589
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:51,768
Hey, wanna come?

590
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:54,645
Oh, my God.

591
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:12,293
Oh, God,
where are we going?

592
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,540
Seventh floor.

593
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:14,692
Why?

594
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,088
Lucky number?

595
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:48,933
The maid's quarters?

596
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,467
Romantic.

597
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:51,906
You know what they say.

598
00:40:52,002 --> 00:40:54,016
Beggars can't be choosers.

599
00:40:54,113 --> 00:40:56,127
Who's begging?

600
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:43,316
Richie? Richie?

601
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,018
Help!

602
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:07,679
Somebody...

603
00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:27,821
What do you want?

604
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:34,918
What do you want?

605
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:45,086
Richie!

606
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:48,155
Richie!

607
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,526
No!

608
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:57,650
No!

609
00:42:57,747 --> 00:43:00,720
Please... please.

610
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:12,614
Did you say something?

611
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,628
You know...

612
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:17,505
We're all alone up here.

613
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:29,398
You remember when I said
that you could do better than Kira?

614
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:36,400
Well, I didn't mean
this much better.

615
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:42,922
Oh, my God.
That's so pathetic.

616
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,513
My phone!

617
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:47,431
I'm having my sister up.

618
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:49,828
Where did you get a cell?

619
00:43:49,925 --> 00:43:51,363
Duh, I took
it from Hannah.

620
00:43:51,459 --> 00:43:53,185
Hey, bitch, what's up?

621
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:56,447
No, yeah, save
this number tonight.

622
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,365
This is the cell
that I'm using, okay?

623
00:43:58,461 --> 00:44:01,242
Fuck this.

624
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:06,038
Oh my God, no, it's just this
total bonehead called Michael.

625
00:44:06,134 --> 00:44:08,052
He thinks he's
such a badass.

626
00:44:42,774 --> 00:44:44,500
Do you see the sin?

627
00:44:56,682 --> 00:44:58,888
Open your eyes.

628
00:44:58,984 --> 00:45:00,806
Open your eyes and
wash the sins out.

629
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:36,582
What ya got in here?

630
00:46:40,653 --> 00:46:42,187
Russell, hold up.

631
00:46:42,284 --> 00:46:43,626
What?

632
00:46:43,723 --> 00:46:44,586
You're kidding, right?

633
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:46,600
No, wait.

634
00:46:46,696 --> 00:46:49,093
There's something weird
about that mirror.

635
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,683
Let me up.

636
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,849
Mirror... I'll check it out.

637
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:02,137
Damn. You know what?

638
00:47:02,234 --> 00:47:03,193
This is a two-way mirror.

639
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:04,535
What?

640
00:47:08,852 --> 00:47:10,290
Get out! Go!

641
00:47:38,682 --> 00:47:40,983
What the fuck was that?

642
00:47:49,808 --> 00:47:51,150
No bars.

643
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,891
We can get down to
the atrium from here.

644
00:47:54,987 --> 00:47:56,617
Okay.

645
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:13,978
It's not tight enough.

646
00:48:14,075 --> 00:48:15,897
It'll get tighter
when you hang on it.

647
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,527
I'll get stuck
on the glass roof.

648
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:19,924
Just kick it out.
You'll be fine.

649
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:21,555
Okay? You'll be fine.

650
00:48:28,558 --> 00:48:30,284
Oh, God, I can't do this.

651
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,722
You have to.

652
00:48:34,984 --> 00:48:36,998
God.

653
00:48:51,865 --> 00:48:55,030
Oh, God!
Russell, go slow.

654
00:48:55,126 --> 00:48:56,852
Okay.

655
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:01,072
It's all right.

656
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,129
Russell, stop.

657
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:16,803
Russell? Russell!

658
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:20,255
Russell, what was that?

659
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:23,037
Russell, where are you?

660
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:25,051
Russell. Why are you
pulling me up?

661
00:49:25,915 --> 00:49:26,970
Russell, stop.

662
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,410
No!

663
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:40,781
Stop! Let go!

664
00:49:40,974 --> 00:49:42,892
Let go of me!

665
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:45,577
Stop! Let me go!

666
00:49:56,608 --> 00:49:59,581
Let me go.
Let me down.

667
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:02,842
Please let me down!

668
00:50:04,185 --> 00:50:06,199
Let me go.

669
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:13,392
Let me go!

670
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:16,557
No!

671
00:50:49,936 --> 00:50:52,813
Oh, God.

672
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,504
Tease.

673
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:19,670
Tease? Michael,
do you even have a car?

674
00:51:19,766 --> 00:51:21,588
You skank.

675
00:51:21,684 --> 00:51:22,930
What the fuck?

676
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:26,959
It's stuck.

677
00:51:27,055 --> 00:51:28,110
Move.

678
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:33,098
It's stuck.

679
00:51:33,194 --> 00:51:34,057
No shit.

680
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:35,783
God damn it.

681
00:51:36,935 --> 00:51:40,387
Yeah, hang on a sec,
will you, just give me a second.

682
00:51:40,484 --> 00:51:43,169
So. Where's the
elevator, Columbus?

683
00:51:43,265 --> 00:51:45,087
Get off the phone.

684
00:51:45,183 --> 00:51:46,238
No!

685
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:49,403
I'm not Kira, Mike.

686
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,624
Yeah, I don't know,
some really stupid hotel with a retard.

687
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:05,613
Oh, gross.
Where the hell are they coming from?

688
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:08,202
Oh, my God, shit.

689
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:14,533
Oh my God.

690
00:52:17,123 --> 00:52:18,657
Shit. Fuck.

691
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,716
No!

692
00:54:21,813 --> 00:54:22,963
Oh my God!

693
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,360
Oh, please, no!

694
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:30,061
Michael! Michael, please!

695
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,226
Help me!

696
00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:36,679
Please, God!
Please help me!

697
00:54:39,365 --> 00:54:41,571
It's annoying... the sin.

698
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:43,777
Do you see the sin?

699
00:54:49,532 --> 00:54:51,258
Did you look at them?

700
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,368
Did you see the sin?

701
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:55,190
Do you see their sin?

702
00:54:55,287 --> 00:54:57,397
Look into their eyes.

703
00:54:57,493 --> 00:54:59,027
Oh my God!

704
00:54:59,123 --> 00:55:01,904
The eyes are
the window of the soul.

705
00:55:02,001 --> 00:55:02,864
Michael!

706
00:55:48,232 --> 00:55:49,191
Come on, shit!

707
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:51,109
It won't fuckin' open!

708
00:55:54,466 --> 00:55:56,000
What the fuck, man?

709
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:57,919
It doesn't matter, we're
going after Kira anyway.

710
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,796
He's coming.

711
00:56:00,893 --> 00:56:02,523
We're trapped!

712
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:03,769
We're gonna fucking die!

713
00:56:03,866 --> 00:56:05,016
Shoot him!

714
00:56:05,209 --> 00:56:07,127
Fuck!

715
00:56:12,882 --> 00:56:13,745
Michael?

716
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:16,334
Jesus Christ!

717
00:56:16,431 --> 00:56:17,677
What's wrong with you idiots?

718
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:39,066
What the hell is this?

719
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:41,177
Looks like some
kind of trip wire.

720
00:56:50,385 --> 00:56:53,262
He took Richie
into the elevator.

721
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:09,855
All right, motherfucker.

722
00:57:20,886 --> 00:57:22,516
Christine, come on!

723
00:57:23,763 --> 00:57:25,681
Let's go, we gotta
get out of here!

724
00:57:28,463 --> 00:57:30,477
- Michael!
- Come on!

725
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:38,438
Damn, he broke it!

726
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,083
Oh, shit!

727
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:43,905
What the fuck
are we gonna do now?

728
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:45,535
We gotta go up.

729
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:47,166
Hurry up!

730
00:57:51,099 --> 00:57:52,154
Shit!

731
00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:55,127
Help me up!
Pull me up, come on!

732
00:57:55,223 --> 00:57:56,949
Quick, grab my hand.

733
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,406
Go, come on, go.

734
00:58:14,502 --> 00:58:16,516
Come on, go, go.

735
00:58:20,065 --> 00:58:21,599
Come on, let's go this way.

736
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:23,710
Kira!

737
00:58:24,765 --> 00:58:27,066
God.

738
00:58:27,163 --> 00:58:28,601
Kira!

739
00:58:28,698 --> 00:58:30,904
Shit, the other elevator.

740
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,959
Kira!

741
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:32,918
Help!

742
00:58:33,014 --> 00:58:34,452
Come on.

743
00:58:34,548 --> 00:58:35,507
Help me.

744
00:58:35,603 --> 00:58:38,096
She's in here.

745
00:58:38,193 --> 00:58:39,343
Shit.

746
00:58:42,126 --> 00:58:43,276
Come on, Tye!

747
00:58:48,552 --> 00:58:51,237
Holy shit.

748
00:58:51,334 --> 00:58:54,115
Look at all this money.

749
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:55,841
I'll be damn, Richie Rich.

750
00:58:55,937 --> 00:58:58,143
It really was a safe.

751
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,198
Look at all this damn money.

752
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:02,363
Oh my God.

753
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,282
Are these human eyes?

754
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:09,653
Help!

755
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:11,091
Kira?

756
00:59:13,874 --> 00:59:14,737
Kira?

757
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:15,983
Help, please!

758
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,765
Tye, she's in here,
come on!

759
00:59:18,861 --> 00:59:21,258
Come on, Tye.

760
00:59:26,343 --> 00:59:27,973
Kira... are you in here?

761
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:29,124
Hurry!

762
00:59:38,907 --> 00:59:40,153
Oh God, Christine,
get me out of here.

763
00:59:42,264 --> 00:59:43,894
Move quick!

764
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:47,922
How?

765
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:48,882
The keys.

766
00:59:48,978 --> 00:59:50,320
They're over there
on the table.

767
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:52,047
Richie.

768
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,774
He's coming, come on!

769
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:56,459
I gotta go.
I'm gonna come back, okay?

770
00:59:56,556 --> 00:59:57,706
Don't leave me.

771
01:00:16,218 --> 01:00:18,040
I wish you'd just kill me.

772
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,809
We gotta draw him out.

773
01:00:25,906 --> 01:00:26,961
What do you mean
we gotta draw him out?

774
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:28,975
We gotta get his attention.
Make some noise or something.

775
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,523
Come on, Tye, this
is our only chance.

776
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,761
Oh, you pig!

777
01:00:55,448 --> 01:00:58,229
You're sick.
You're fucking sick!

778
01:01:06,094 --> 01:01:08,012
You filthy little pig.

779
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:10,697
You enjoy this, don't you?

780
01:01:10,794 --> 01:01:12,520
Oh, I can tell you do.

781
01:01:12,616 --> 01:01:14,150
I see that.

782
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:15,493
I see what you're doing.

783
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:16,357
Stop it.

784
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:25,948
No.

785
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:33,909
Oh, no.

786
01:02:08,151 --> 01:02:09,493
Okay, Kira.

787
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:12,754
Where are the keys?

788
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:14,097
He took them.

789
01:02:17,455 --> 01:02:18,893
Shit.

790
01:02:58,315 --> 01:02:59,753
This'll work.

791
01:03:01,096 --> 01:03:02,534
Come on.

792
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:06,467
Hurry.

793
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:20,183
Tye.

794
01:03:22,197 --> 01:03:23,347
Hurry.

795
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:37,735
Open the cage!

796
01:03:38,503 --> 01:03:39,558
Christine!

797
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,530
Shit.

798
01:03:48,382 --> 01:03:51,355
Oh, Margaret, Margaret.
Thank God.

799
01:03:55,096 --> 01:03:57,110
What are you
doing in there?

800
01:03:57,206 --> 01:03:58,740
There's this guy,
and he's just...

801
01:03:58,837 --> 01:04:00,371
Oh, shit.

802
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:10,634
I'd like you to tell me.

803
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,127
Why is that whore still alive?

804
01:04:14,471 --> 01:04:16,677
What? No.

805
01:04:17,828 --> 01:04:20,321
Why is she still alive?

806
01:04:20,418 --> 01:04:20,993
You know him?

807
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:24,925
Know him?
He's my son.

808
01:04:25,022 --> 01:04:28,474
He's the hand of God.

809
01:04:28,571 --> 01:04:29,626
You got us here
to help you.

810
01:04:30,297 --> 01:04:31,160
Help me?

811
01:04:31,256 --> 01:04:33,941
No. Williams was
the one I wanted.

812
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:35,476
Found him.

813
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,792
He hurt my boy.

814
01:04:39,984 --> 01:04:43,532
You were a bonus.

815
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:44,779
Why here?

816
01:04:44,876 --> 01:04:47,657
What better place
to do God's work?

817
01:04:47,754 --> 01:04:50,535
The hotel caters deviants, sinners,

818
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:52,261
and the ones
that hear voices.

819
01:04:52,357 --> 01:04:55,042
There's only one
voice to hear.

820
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:56,865
And that's the voice of God.

821
01:04:56,961 --> 01:04:59,262
And He's told you what to do!

822
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:06,936
Are you fucking insane!

823
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:09,333
This is not what God wants!

824
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,156
Don't you see... the tattoos.

825
01:05:11,253 --> 01:05:13,554
Don't you see the sin?
The tattoos are blasphemy.

826
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:14,610
Don't you see it?

827
01:05:18,063 --> 01:05:20,844
She doesn't know God.
Don't you see it?

828
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:22,090
Don't you see the sin?

829
01:05:22,187 --> 01:05:24,009
You understand, don't you?

830
01:05:24,105 --> 01:05:25,927
That's why you killed the others.
Now it's her turn.

831
01:05:26,024 --> 01:05:27,366
Judge her.

832
01:05:27,462 --> 01:05:28,133
No.

833
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,380
Judge her.

834
01:05:29,477 --> 01:05:30,819
- No.
- Judge her.

835
01:05:30,915 --> 01:05:33,025
Open your eyes.
Judge her.

836
01:05:33,121 --> 01:05:35,422
And wash the sins out.
Judge her.

837
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:36,669
Once your soul's clean,

838
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,067
you'll be the hand of God.

839
01:05:39,164 --> 01:05:40,027
- No.
- Judge her.

840
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:42,233
No!

841
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:47,316
Fine.

842
01:05:48,372 --> 01:05:49,331
I'll do it for you.

843
01:05:50,482 --> 01:05:52,208
Oh, shit!

844
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,509
Because I can see.

845
01:05:55,757 --> 01:05:57,867
Oh, please, no!

846
01:05:57,963 --> 01:05:59,593
Please, God, help!

847
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:01,224
No!

848
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,662
And I...

849
01:06:03,814 --> 01:06:05,540
will not fail God.

850
01:06:06,308 --> 01:06:07,458
Jacob!

851
01:06:07,555 --> 01:06:09,089
What are you doing?
Let me go!

852
01:06:09,185 --> 01:06:10,623
Let go!

853
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,734
You ungrateful bastard!

854
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,076
You hear me?

855
01:06:14,173 --> 01:06:15,803
Don't you see the sin?

856
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:32,972
I want my mama.

857
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:37,959
- Please!
- You brought this home?

858
01:06:38,056 --> 01:06:38,919
Don't you see
what she is?

859
01:06:39,015 --> 01:06:40,070
Look at her.
Look at her.

860
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:41,604
Look at her!

861
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:43,235
Damn you!

862
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:44,673
Let go!

863
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:45,825
You ungrateful bastard!

864
01:06:45,921 --> 01:06:47,071
Haven't you learned anything?

865
01:06:48,894 --> 01:06:49,853
Bastard, you hear me?

866
01:06:49,949 --> 01:06:52,346
Don't you see the evil
in her eyes?

867
01:06:59,733 --> 01:07:00,308
No, no!

868
01:07:01,075 --> 01:07:02,609
You don't see it?

869
01:07:02,706 --> 01:07:05,103
Maybe you just need to take
a closer look at them.

870
01:07:10,859 --> 01:07:12,201
Look! Look at it.

871
01:07:12,297 --> 01:07:13,256
See that?

872
01:07:13,352 --> 01:07:14,886
Have a good look at it.

873
01:07:14,983 --> 01:07:16,613
Look.

874
01:07:31,193 --> 01:07:34,933
I see it.

875
01:07:35,029 --> 01:07:35,892
What?

876
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:00,638
Please, no!

877
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:02,940
You don't have to do this.

878
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,395
No! No!

879
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,382
No!

880
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:44,610
Christine?

881
01:09:44,706 --> 01:09:45,856
He's out of it.

882
01:09:45,953 --> 01:09:47,199
Can you move?

883
01:09:55,353 --> 01:09:56,791
Okay.

884
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:20,099
Come on, Christine.

885
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:21,633
Do it!

886
01:10:21,729 --> 01:10:22,975
Shoot him!

887
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:01,917
Michael!

888
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:03,740
Come on, let's go!

889
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:11,125
Run!

890
01:11:21,868 --> 01:11:22,827
In here!

891
01:11:45,559 --> 01:11:47,285
Christine!

892
01:11:47,381 --> 01:11:49,011
Michael. Michael.

893
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:28,336
Michael!

894
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:29,583
Watch out!

895
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,450
You okay?

896
01:12:44,547 --> 01:12:46,465
Yeah.

897
01:12:53,563 --> 01:12:54,426
No!

898
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:58,550
No!

899
01:12:58,646 --> 01:12:59,892
Fall, you prick!

900
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:01,044
No!

901
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:04,401
No!

902
01:13:13,609 --> 01:13:15,143
Fuck you!

903
01:14:21,517 --> 01:14:23,243
Let's go.

904
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:47,701
Michael, you didn't have
to come back for us.

905
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,785
I didn't want to walk
out of here alone.

906
01:20:21,486 --> 01:20:24,267
