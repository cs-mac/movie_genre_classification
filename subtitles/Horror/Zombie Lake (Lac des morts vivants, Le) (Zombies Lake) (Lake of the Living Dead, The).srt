1
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,009
You coming or not?

2
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:41,311
- All right, I'll get her to you right away.
- Appreciate it.

3
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,537
- Hi.
- Hi.

4
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:48,013
<i>Dr. Klyczynski to ER, stat.
Dr. Klyczynski to ER, stat.</i>

5
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:51,551
- Hi, excuse me.
- Yeah, just a minute, okay?

6
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:56,281
- Fill this out for me and wait over there.
- No, I'm... I'm Dr. Forster.

7
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:57,824
I was told to report here.

8
00:03:57,995 --> 00:04:01,453
You'll be covering 22 patients
on rounds today, this floor and the next.

9
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:03,292
- Twenty-two?
- Quiet morning.

10
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,367
If you get into trouble, beep me,
but don't make it a habit.

11
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,061
The med students
will help you out with scutwork.

12
00:04:09,273 --> 00:04:12,003
What's he doing here?
I ordered an MRI, stat.

13
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,770
- Transport said about four hours.
- He could be dead in four hours.

14
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,175
Never mind. Dr. Forster, MRI.

15
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,408
- A right, two lefts, elevator to two.
- Okay.

16
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,051
Follow the signs.
Hustle back here for rounds.

17
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:25,716
Dr. Kly...

18
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:30,816
- Are you taking me somewhere?
- I certainly hope so, sir.

19
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:33,792
- How are you feeling today?
- Am...? Am I gonna make it?

20
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:36,691
Yes. Absolutely.

21
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:42,804
Alex!

22
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:47,341
I made my famous spinach pie.
The trailer's nice and toasty.

23
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:49,409
I can't.

24
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:55,874
Look, it's really cold out here.
Don't get sick on me or anything.

25
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,577
I never get sick.

26
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:03,521
So I heard you bought a house,
and apparently I'm the last one to know.

27
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,126
I thought I mentioned that.

28
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:07,057
Wait.

29
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:09,028
Where?

30
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,531
Outside of town.
Up the shore a little bit.

31
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:13,430
Up the shore? There's no houses...

32
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:17,573
Oh, God. You don't mean that thing
with the stilts and the...?

33
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,543
- You all right?
- Yeah. Are you crazy?

34
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:27,578
Why would you take that house, Alex?

35
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,447
It's made of glass. There's no privacy.

36
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:32,315
Mona?

37
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:35,054
Get yourself some boots.

38
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,056
Hey, Gonzalez!

39
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:46,802
- Four-thirty.
- You lost?

40
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:50,064
- Yeah.
- Takes a while to get your bearings.

41
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:53,402
- I'm Madhvi.
- Kate Forster. Hi.

42
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,011
Oh, wrong floor.
Where'd you do your residency?

43
00:05:57,247 --> 00:06:00,011
Just a little community hospital
up on the North Shore.

44
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:24,207
<i>Dear new tenant,
welcome to your new home.</i>

45
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:26,170
<i>As the previous tenant, let me say...</i>

46
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,345
<i>... I hope you'll like living here
as much as I did.</i>

47
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:32,640
<i>I filed the change of address
with the post office...</i>

48
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,182
<i>... but you know
what a crapshoot that can be.</i>

49
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:39,048
<i>So if anything slips through, would you
do me a favor and forward my mail?</i>

50
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,952
<i>I'd appreciate it.
My new address is below.</i>

51
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,994
<i>Thanks in advance. P. S:</i>

52
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:51,691
"Sorry about the paw prints by the front
door. They were there when I moved in.

53
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,195
Same with the box in the attic."

54
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,306
Paw prints?
What the hell is she talking about?

55
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:18,828
Hey, baby girl. Hi. Hi. Hey.

56
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:32,066
Fix the light.

57
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:35,203
Get dog food, huh?

58
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:38,180
Get human food.

59
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:09,740
Hey. Hey.

60
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,779
Hey, come here.

61
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:29,923
Sixty degrees on Valentine's Day.
Can't be Chicago.

62
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,499
The TV says it's global warming.

63
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,469
The icebergs start melting,
water covers the Earth.

64
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:39,335
Thank God we won't live to see it.

65
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:42,177
What's this?

66
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,948
That's nothing.
It's one of your father's.

67
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:48,584
- Dostoyevsky?
- Oh, yeah.

68
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:55,256
It's about a guy who breaks the neck
of a poor woman with an axe...

69
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:59,259
...and, so far, keeps wandering
around regretting it.

70
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,066
This is good.

71
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:07,669
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. It's really good.

72
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:09,861
I'll meet you there.

73
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:11,472
What are you thinking?

74
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:13,374
My folks are coming into town.

75
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,271
Nothing.

76
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:19,711
When your father passed away,
it was hard. It still is hard.

77
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:24,820
Holding his books,
I feel like he's with me somehow.

78
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,786
Knowing that he was once
on the same pages...

79
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,152
...reading the same words.

80
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,994
Oh, my God!
Somebody call an ambulance!

81
00:09:39,703 --> 00:09:41,364
We need an ambulance at Daley Plaza.

82
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:44,540
A man has been struck by a bus.
Get an EMT crew here. Sir...

83
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,606
Get out the street.
Get on the sidewalk.

84
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,607
- On the sidewalk. Off the street.
- Sir?

85
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:51,337
Get on the sidewalk!
Get on the sidewalk!

86
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:54,814
I'd like to get the foundation
on number 17 dug today.

87
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:58,183
Look, I know you're
kind of new around here, kid.

88
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:00,015
What?

89
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:03,351
I can't get to 17 until
at least next week.

90
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,552
Come on, Mulhern.
That's bullshit and you know it.

91
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:09,061
Take Clemens and Rodriguez
off of roofing.

92
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,928
Jorge can run the backhoe
they're not using on 14...

93
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:14,330
...and grab four or five
of those other guys...

94
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:16,836
...who are doing nothing
on seven and 10.

95
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,635
Paulie, Carlos, Frank, Danny,
and what's-his-name, the tall guy?

96
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:23,335
- Rafael.
- Rafael.

97
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:26,345
- Let's go.
- Okay.

98
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,074
- Ready?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,617
- Well, I need it to 10 and 11.
- Hey!

100
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:37,091
<i>Housekeeping ER
to the Suture Room, please.</i>

101
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:40,786
<i>Housekeeping ER to the Suture Room.</i>

102
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:46,396
- Hey.
- Hi.

103
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:49,436
I heard about Daley Plaza.

104
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:52,969
EMT said you fought hard for the guy.

105
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:56,378
Yeah. Really knocked myself out.

106
00:10:57,047 --> 00:11:01,108
<i>Kate, I'm going to tell you
what I tell every young doctor.</i>

107
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:04,310
<i>Hopefully, you'll be the first to listen.</i>

108
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:10,220
<i>On your day off, get as far away
from this place as you can.</i>

109
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:15,729
<i>Go someplace where you feel
most like yourself.</i>

110
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,747
<i>Dear Ms. Forster:</i>

111
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:14,287
<i>I got your note...</i>

112
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:17,756
<i>... and I'm afraid there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.</i>

113
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:21,897
<i>As far as I know, the lake house
has been empty for several years.</i>

114
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:25,659
<i>Maybe your note was intended for
the Sandburg house down the shore...</i>

115
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:29,361
"...since no one has lived
in this house for years.

116
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:33,501
But I'm curious about the paw prints."

117
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:42,477
<i>Dear Mr. Wyler, I'm very familiar
with the Sandburg cottage...</i>

118
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:45,211
<i>... and I can guarantee
I never lived there.</i>

119
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:49,188
<i>I'm old-fashioned, but I don't think a
cottage should be over 6000 square feet.</i>

120
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:51,360
<i>So let me try again.</i>

121
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,724
<i>I used to live at the lake house,
then I moved.</i>

122
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:58,560
<i>Now I live at 1620 North Racine
in Chicago.</i>

123
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:01,828
<i>I'd appreciate it if you would
forward my mail if you get any.</i>

124
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:05,804
<i>Oh, by the way, it's 2006.</i>

125
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:08,603
<i>Has been all year, ask anyone.</i>

126
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:11,313
2006?

127
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,214
What does she mean, 2006?

128
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:16,853
God.

129
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,109
Oh, God.

130
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,419
- Good morning, Mr. Wyler.
- Morning, Mr. Wyler.

131
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,117
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, morning.

132
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:27,125
Hello, Mr. Wyler.

133
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:29,599
Mr. Wyler.

134
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,265
Sir.

135
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:37,701
Well, obviously,
I derived my inspiration...

136
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:41,139
...for the metaphor
of the fugue, the loop...

137
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:44,640
Yeah.

138
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:07,766
- Two hours of that shit. You kidding me?
- What are you talking about?

139
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:12,499
- He didn't say a word.
- Sadistic, bitter, bitter old man.

140
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:15,677
I think you're being
a little overdramatic.

141
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:21,313
Where are you going?

142
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:32,458
Man, I love that place.

143
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:56,650
I can't believe that thing's
still running.

144
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:01,283
Yep.

145
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:04,025
You look like shit.

146
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:06,658
I missed you too.

147
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:27,712
Hey, forget about him.

148
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:34,213
- Condos.
- Riviera Estates.

149
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:36,220
- You're joking.
- I don't believe this.

150
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:38,256
I come back after four years...

151
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,360
...and I get this in front of me.
- What?

152
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:42,690
My brother thinking
he's Frank Lloyd Whatever.

153
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,867
- Oh, come on.
- Dad keeps you hostage...

154
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:47,764
...in that little
mythmaking factory of his...

155
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:51,337
...while you haven't built so much as
a phone booth or a hamster cage.

156
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:53,203
That's funny you say that, actually.

157
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,470
I have a hamster cage in mind.
A development of them, actually.

158
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,843
Prefab, no foundations.
What do you think about that?

159
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,247
See, that's what I'm talking about.
You have vision.

160
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:06,117
Speaking of which...

161
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:09,621
...l'd like you to know
I bought a house.

162
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,852
- Where?
- On the lake.

163
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,230
A lake house.
So you are making some money.

164
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:16,888
Well, it's a dump.
Been abandoned for years, but...

165
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,364
So you got an abandoned,
haunted lake hou...

166
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:21,127
That's as good a reason as any...

167
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:24,135
...for selling out and joining
the flabby-developers' guild.

168
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:27,741
- How about this? I even got a dog.
- You got a dog?

169
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:33,712
He just showed up at the house
from out of nowhere.

170
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:48,458
- What are we doing here?
- I have to deliver a letter.

171
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:53,102
It should be here.
1620 North Racine.

172
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,100
But...

173
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:00,670
...there's nothing here.

174
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:06,077
Are we meeting someone?
Does somebody live here? What?

175
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,178
Yeah.

176
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:10,613
I thought so.

177
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,249
Should we ring the bell?

178
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:32,868
<i>Dear Ms. Forster:</i>

179
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:36,806
<i>I went to 1620 North Racine,
and it's not there.</i>

180
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:39,204
<i>It's just a construction site.</i>

181
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:43,510
<i>From the pictures it looks nice,
but not for another 18 months.</i>

182
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,688
<i>What am I missing here?</i>

183
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:49,381
<i>Maybe you got the address wrong,
because you got the date wrong too.</i>

184
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:52,459
You really wanna play this game.

185
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:58,598
If you are truly in the year 2004...

186
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:01,600
...then...

187
00:18:03,873 --> 00:18:05,966
...be forewarned.

188
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,238
Remember that day?
You were not happy. Remember that?

189
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,644
I know.

190
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:18,186
<i>Okay, my mystery correspondent,
I get it.</i>

191
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,755
<i>Just in case you really are
where and when you think you are...</i>

192
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:23,549
<i>... you'll need this.</i>

193
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,059
<i>There was a freak late snow that spring
and everyone got sick.</i>

194
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:31,893
<i>So plenty of rest, lots of fluids.
Doctor's orders.</i>

195
00:18:32,135 --> 00:18:35,002
Snow. Right.

196
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:42,645
Yeah, come to papa.

197
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:20,671
Jackie.

198
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,607
Jack.

199
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:27,141
Jack, come on. Come on, girl.
Come on, come on. Jack.

200
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:16,557
"Impossible, I know. Not possible...

201
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,991
...but it's happening."

202
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:31,176
Okay.

203
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:37,113
Where am I?

204
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:44,051
Very clever.

205
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:48,087
"The lake house."

206
00:21:48,531 --> 00:21:51,523
The lake house. As you can see,
I, too, am at the lake house...

207
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:54,864
...but I'm getting tired of these games
so I'm leaving, okay? Bye.

208
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,266
Thank you. Bye.

209
00:21:58,841 --> 00:22:02,038
Maybe we should
introduce ourselves properly.

210
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:10,584
<i>I'm a doctor,
dedicated to curing the sick.</i>

211
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:12,648
<i>At least, trying to.</i>

212
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,122
<i>I'm an architect. I like to build.</i>

213
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:19,157
<i>And while I wouldn't say
my current project is ideal...</i>

214
00:22:19,395 --> 00:22:24,458
<i>... it allows me to be here, in this place,
and that's enough for now.</i>

215
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:28,760
<i>But tell me something. If you're working
in a hospital in Chicago now...</i>

216
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:31,906
<i>... where were you before, in my time?</i>

217
00:22:32,675 --> 00:22:34,302
<i>Two years ago, in your time...</i>

218
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,606
<i>... I was working
in internal medicine in Madison.</i>

219
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,948
<i>Tell me about the future.</i>

220
00:22:43,953 --> 00:22:46,683
<i>What's it like in the year 2006?</i>

221
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:50,754
<i>I'm afraid the world's
pretty much the same.</i>

222
00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:55,954
<i>Of course, we all dress in shiny metal
jump suits and drive flying cars...</i>

223
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:59,896
<i>... and no one talks anymore
because we can read each other's minds.</i>

224
00:23:00,103 --> 00:23:03,197
<i>But the truth is, man from the past...</i>

225
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:06,966
<i>... not much has really changed
in 2006.</i>

226
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,475
<i>Speaking of the past, though,
I've been thinking about the paw prints.</i>

227
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:16,880
<i>- How is that possible?
- Well, I think we have the same dog.</i>

228
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:20,178
<i>Oh, yeah? What's yours like?</i>

229
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:24,189
<i>According to the vet,
mine is eight years old in my time...</i>

230
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:26,418
<i>...six in yours.</i>

231
00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:32,424
<i>She's skinny, has sad eyes, snores,
and sleeps like a person.</i>

232
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:34,933
<i>I don't know why, but I call her Jack.</i>

233
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:37,129
Hello, Jack.

234
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:42,869
<i>It's nice out here.</i>

235
00:23:43,146 --> 00:23:46,377
<i>Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.</i>

236
00:23:46,582 --> 00:23:48,516
<i>- Hey.
- We have to eat.</i>

237
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,312
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be asleep.

238
00:23:51,687 --> 00:23:52,881
<i>I'll cook.</i>

239
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:55,950
<i>I thought you didn't like to cook.</i>

240
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:58,854
<i>No, I don't like to cook.</i>

241
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:01,086
Is she gonna marry him?

242
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:04,893
- What do you think?
- I don't know. He's kind of old.

243
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:08,264
<i>- Where are you going?
- Okay, he's not that old.</i>

244
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,669
My mom's last boyfriend was bald.

245
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:12,773
He was nice...

246
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:15,740
...but my mom didn't marry him.
- No?

247
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:18,845
"There's always something better
coming around the corner."

248
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:21,414
That's what she says.

249
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:25,412
Maybe that's what that lady should do.
Wait for something better...

250
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:28,590
...to come around the corner.
- Maybe.

251
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:34,359
But if she's not careful,
she could spend her whole life waiting.

252
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:37,630
<i>Do you want me to bring
anything back with me?</i>

253
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,428
<i>Yes. What about
a nice bottle of wine...</i>

254
00:24:41,204 --> 00:24:42,762
<i>... to celebrate?</i>

255
00:24:43,005 --> 00:24:46,031
<i>- What time shall I come back?
- Seven o'clock.</i>

256
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:49,006
<i>Sorry I haven't made it
to the mailbox lately.</i>

257
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:53,148
<i>It's been a long week. All night shifts.</i>

258
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:56,510
<i>Good to hear from you.
I thought you left me.</i>

259
00:24:56,719 --> 00:25:00,450
<i>You should know that you're
my only connection to the future.</i>

260
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,321
<i>How come we never talk
about the things we like?</i>

261
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,152
<i>Well, let's see.
Reading the classics to Jack.</i>

262
00:25:08,397 --> 00:25:11,525
<i>- Who's his favorite?
- Dostoyevsky.</i>

263
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:15,397
<i>For me, this city,
on a day when the light is so clear...</i>

264
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:17,232
<i>... that I can touch every detail...</i>

265
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,102
<i>... every brick and window
in the buildings I love.</i>

266
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:24,905
<i>Come on, take a walk with me
this Saturday. Let me show you.</i>

267
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:28,550
<i>You're crazy. Why are you going
through all this trouble for me?</i>

268
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:31,777
<i>No trouble. Summer's here.</i>

269
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:48,096
<i>Okay, your turn. Favorite things.</i>

270
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:51,137
<i>Where to start? Okay.</i>

271
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,434
<i>When I smell the flowers
before I see them.</i>

272
00:25:54,644 --> 00:25:58,944
<i>When it starts to rain
just as the picnic is ending.</i>

273
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:03,016
<i>And I love the smell of Jack's paws.</i>

274
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:05,847
<i>You didn't forget
to mention your husband, did you?</i>

275
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:10,316
<i>Well, of course I love my husband,
who is also a doctor.</i>

276
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:12,960
<i>Plastic surgeon
for small farm animals.</i>

277
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:15,460
<i>Good. I'm married too.</i>

278
00:26:15,665 --> 00:26:19,123
<i>I've got eight children,
and none of them look like me.</i>

279
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:22,498
<i>- I'm worried, Kate.
- I would be too.</i>

280
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:24,304
<i>I'm single.</i>

281
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:26,904
<i>Me too.</i>

282
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,810
<i>Number 27.</i>

283
00:26:32,014 --> 00:26:34,175
<i>She's a beauty.
My father used to tell me...</i>

284
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:37,250
<i>... she was the grandma
for all the houses in the city.</i>

285
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:40,922
<i>He used to take me on walks
like I'm taking you now.</i>

286
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:44,622
<i>- Alex?
- Kate?</i>

287
00:26:44,827 --> 00:26:47,660
<i>I wish we could have
done this walk together.</i>

288
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:04,542
So, what do you think?

289
00:27:04,847 --> 00:27:07,281
He sounds like a nice boy.

290
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,146
Sounds like a nice boy.
Anything else?

291
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:13,686
- He has wonderful penmanship.
- Mother...

292
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:16,256
...look at the date on the letter.
The date.

293
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:17,949
- You mean the time thing?
- Yes.

294
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:20,788
- That's just a detail.
- Just a detail?

295
00:27:29,872 --> 00:27:32,966
About the...
The other day...

296
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:38,078
...it was not a good moment.
I was in a hell of a hurry.

297
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:40,041
Of course.

298
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,611
You've got some nice pieces here.

299
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:47,619
Oh, yeah. Music's fine, music helps.

300
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:49,985
It's like Nietzsche says:

301
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:53,491
- "Life would be senseless..."
- "Without music."

302
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:56,297
I guess I told you that, huh?

303
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:57,932
Pour yourself a drink.

304
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,399
Can you appreciate
a good wine by now?

305
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:03,504
You bet.

306
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,434
You know, you'll have to forgive
your father for being curious...

307
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:10,806
...but where have you been
all these years?

308
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,412
I thought your Kerouac days
were behind you.

309
00:28:15,418 --> 00:28:18,216
- I'm sorry, what?
- What?

310
00:28:19,455 --> 00:28:21,946
Oh, you can come up, if you like.

311
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:32,293
What are you working on?

312
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:35,528
Oh, I'm just...
I'm just remembering things.

313
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:38,433
It's not such an easy job,
let me tell you.

314
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:41,610
Nor is it particularly innocent,
in my case.

315
00:28:41,811 --> 00:28:45,178
Your father is writing his memoirs.

316
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:48,543
- Are we in it?
- What do you think?

317
00:28:48,718 --> 00:28:50,481
Do you wanna be?

318
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,019
Do you?

319
00:28:53,255 --> 00:28:56,850
Of course.
You were all a part of your father's life.

320
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,220
Why are you talking to me
in the third person?

321
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:02,057
Well, l... I don't...

322
00:29:02,298 --> 00:29:05,631
Because I'm writing about myself,
I suppose. Why, doesn't it suit you?

323
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:11,996
I thought you might like these.

324
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:16,207
What are these?
Something you've been working on?

325
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:19,279
No, they're... They're yours.

326
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:23,543
From a house I just bought
on the lake.

327
00:29:24,587 --> 00:29:28,318
Oh, yes, I heard. They said
some sleazy little condo developer...

328
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:30,515
...had snapped it up.

329
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:34,158
Oh, come on. Indulge your father.

330
00:29:34,363 --> 00:29:37,355
Can't you take a little joke,
for God's sake?

331
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,497
Come on.

332
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:41,397
Tell me.

333
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:44,066
Where have you been?
I really want to know.

334
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:46,797
I was trying to forget you.

335
00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:50,876
Or forgive you.

336
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:54,375
Did you succeed?

337
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:58,380
No.

338
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:05,751
Let me know
if you need any help remembering.

339
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:10,823
Oh, yeah, I will.

340
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,229
Charging 360. Get 1 milligram of epi.
Have 300 amio ready in case we need it.

341
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:18,065
- All clear?
- Clear.

342
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:22,335
Hold compression, start bagging.

343
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:23,842
He's got a rhythm. Slow.

344
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:26,640
- Do we have a pulse with that?
- We got a pulse, thready.

345
00:30:26,882 --> 00:30:28,782
<i>- It's getting stronger.
- Long days, these days.</i>

346
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:31,714
<i>I just worked 30 hours straight.</i>

347
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:34,412
<i>Every time I stop to take a breath...</i>

348
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:37,888
<i>... I realize how isolated
I've let myself become.</i>

349
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,997
<i>Believe me,
you can get a bit desperate.</i>

350
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:47,101
That one? Okay. There you go.

351
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:51,501
Nice move. Very nice. Nice.

352
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:57,169
<i>It's not that I'm complaining,
I love my work.</i>

353
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:01,747
<i>And our tour through Chicago
opened my eyes to its beauty.</i>

354
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:04,886
<i>But my heart still misses
the lake house...</i>

355
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:07,282
<i>... and its trees.</i>

356
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,818
<i>I miss those trees so much.</i>

357
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,597
<i>Don't worry, Kate.
We'll be together in time.</i>

358
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,173
<i>Even if we're far apart,
I'll find a way to be close to you...</i>

359
00:32:35,377 --> 00:32:37,402
<i>... and take care of you.</i>

360
00:32:42,785 --> 00:32:44,582
Katerina.

361
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:47,784
Take this.

362
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,124
- You should eat more. You too skinny.
- I'm not too skinny.

363
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:54,558
Remember how you used to eat
when you were little?

364
00:32:54,763 --> 00:32:56,492
- With your hands.
- Yes, I remember.

365
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:59,532
Now, did you or did you not
write to each other?

366
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:01,802
- To your father?
- No, to Clark Gable.

367
00:33:02,037 --> 00:33:04,631
Yes, to Dad.

368
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:08,805
I...

369
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:12,770
What, Mom?

370
00:33:13,015 --> 00:33:15,006
Before your father...

371
00:33:15,217 --> 00:33:16,946
Yeah?

372
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:22,018
- There was this boy.

373
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,426
Did you love him?

374
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:27,990
Yeah.

375
00:33:33,335 --> 00:33:35,929
Well, why didn't you marry him?

376
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:41,140
So that you could ask me
this question someday.

377
00:33:51,286 --> 00:33:53,345
Looks smaller.

378
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,554
When did he complete it?

379
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:01,154
You weren't born yet,
and I was 8.

380
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:08,928
Corbusier meets Frank Lloyd Wright.

381
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:12,630
You know, Dad played cards
with both of them.

382
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:17,167
- Sharing a joint.
- Yeah, well...

383
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,714
Can't swim.

384
00:34:20,082 --> 00:34:23,779
There should be a stairway
down to the water, a porch, a deck.

385
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,821
Here, you're in a...
In a box.

386
00:34:27,022 --> 00:34:30,287
A glass box with a view
to everything that's around you...

387
00:34:30,492 --> 00:34:31,959
...but you can't touch it.

388
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:36,495
No interconnection
between you and what you're looking at.

389
00:34:36,698 --> 00:34:39,531
I don't know, you know.
He's got this big maple growing...

390
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:42,727
...right in the middle of the house.
- Containment.

391
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:49,804
Containment and control.

392
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:55,640
This house is about ownership,
not connection.

393
00:34:56,251 --> 00:35:00,051
I mean, it's beautiful. Seductive, even.

394
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:03,224
But it's incomplete.

395
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:07,358
It was all about him.

396
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:11,431
Dad knew how to build a house,
not a home.

397
00:35:12,434 --> 00:35:13,765
But you know...

398
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:16,937
...I think he wants us to do
what he couldn't.

399
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,732
But admitting that...

400
00:35:20,442 --> 00:35:24,503
...would mean admitting
that he came up short in some way...

401
00:35:24,713 --> 00:35:26,578
...that he could do more.

402
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:28,841
And that tortures him.

403
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:32,676
Do you remember
being here with Mom?

404
00:35:39,528 --> 00:35:41,587
I remember she tried
to make it work here...

405
00:35:42,865 --> 00:35:44,730
...with us...

406
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:46,959
...with him.

407
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:50,765
Hey, what about Visionary Vanguard?

408
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,567
- What about it?
- Come on.

409
00:35:53,742 --> 00:35:57,610
You can't convince me you're gonna
be happy building saltboxes for tourists.

410
00:35:58,113 --> 00:36:00,377
Nobody's gonna admire you for that.

411
00:36:00,582 --> 00:36:03,642
- Admire me for that?
- Yeah, Visionary Vanguard.

412
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:06,410
That's your idea.

413
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,453
I can't. But you can keep the name.

414
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,785
No, come on.
It's gotta be you and me.

415
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:13,757
Henry, I'm sorry, I can't.

416
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:15,452
I just...

417
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:18,894
- What?
- I've got other plans.

418
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:21,092
You have a girlfriend?

419
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:23,996
No...

420
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:25,936
No.

421
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:29,436
- What is that? You hesitated.
- No, I didn't hesitate.

422
00:36:31,246 --> 00:36:33,646
Come on, man.
I don't have any time for that.

423
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,209
What does time have to do with it?

424
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:40,352
Oh, you're gonna think I'm crazy.

425
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:47,728
<i>My dearest Mr. Wyler:</i>

426
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,660
<i>Are you willing to play a game
with me?</i>

427
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,531
<i>Two years ago today,
I was taking the 145 train to Madison...</i>

428
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,137
<i>... from the Riverside station
and I forgot something there.</i>

429
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,865
<i>It was a gift from my father.</i>

430
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:05,336
<i>If you find it,
can you please put it in the mailbox?</i>

431
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:08,475
<i>It would mean a lot.</i>

432
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:12,015
<i>Yours, Kate.</i>

433
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:32,763
- Final call for the 5:46 to Madison.
- Do you really wanna know? Come on.

434
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:35,170
- All aboard.
- Okay.

435
00:37:45,287 --> 00:37:46,879
I'll call you.

436
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:31,563
<i>Kate, I found it. I have it with me.</i>

437
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,463
<i>One day I'll get it to you. Trust me.</i>

438
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:37,695
<i>I know how important it is to you.</i>

439
00:38:38,974 --> 00:38:42,410
<i>You might not remember,
but we saw each other.</i>

440
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,704
<i>At least, I saw you.</i>

441
00:38:45,947 --> 00:38:50,111
<i>You never told me
how beautiful you are.</i>

442
00:38:50,352 --> 00:38:52,843
<i>Well, maybe you saw somebody else.</i>

443
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:55,546
<i>That was a bad hair year for me.</i>

444
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:59,090
<i>Long brown hair.
Gentle, unguarded eyes.</i>

445
00:38:59,294 --> 00:39:01,159
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

446
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:03,227
<i>You saw me.</i>

447
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:06,060
<i>But I still don't know
what you look like.</i>

448
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,094
<i>Well, why don't we just get together
in the future...</i>

449
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:13,968
<i>... and you can let me know
what you think.</i>

450
00:39:14,943 --> 00:39:16,740
It's a date.

451
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:21,438
Okay.

452
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,984
Why don't you call me
July 10th, 2006...

453
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:31,421
...at 9:05 p.m.

454
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:48,474
<i>- Hello.
- Kate?</i>

455
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,510
<i>- Yes.
- It's Morgan.</i>

456
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,008
Morgan.

457
00:39:56,218 --> 00:39:59,119
<i>I'm in Chicago. I came for a meeting,
but it was canceled...</i>

458
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:01,050
<i>... so I thought I'd give you a call.</i>

459
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,984
Hey, have you eaten?

460
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:07,684
- No, but I'm not...
- Neither have I. I realized I'm starving.

461
00:40:07,929 --> 00:40:10,489
- We could grab a quick bite.
- Okay.

462
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,564
- Yeah?
- All right.

463
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:16,430
- Hey, wait up.
- Watch out, man.

464
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:19,502
- All right.
- Looks pretty good.

465
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,175
- Perfect.
- No, Morgan, it's...

466
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,707
- It's not.
- No, no, trust me.

467
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:25,412
It's... Okay.

468
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,144
Hi there.

469
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,511
One sec.
Could you hold on for a moment?

470
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:33,085
- We'd love a table for two.
- The name?

471
00:40:34,956 --> 00:40:36,821
We don't...
We don't have a reservation.

472
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:39,927
I'm sorry, sir,
we're booked until October.

473
00:40:41,062 --> 00:40:42,154
October?

474
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:46,262
Well...

475
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,063
...l'll get back to you.

476
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:53,371
That went well.

477
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:55,839
It's no big deal.

478
00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:01,247
Oh, come on, stop it.

479
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:04,351
It's the best restaurant in town.
Nobody gets a table here.

480
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:08,080
- No, it's not that.
- Well, what is it?

481
00:41:11,593 --> 00:41:13,686
I didn't do this right.

482
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:17,721
- There wasn't a meeting.
- You'd see me if there was no big deal.

483
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,025
- If it was just...
- Ambush.

484
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:22,067
- You know, coffee,
and coffee can turn into dinner...

485
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:24,728
...dinner can turn into...
- Turn into what?

486
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:27,136
I do sometimes
get a few steps ahead of myself.

487
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:32,438
Morgan, a few steps?
You're always leaping 10 steps ahead.

488
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:35,739
We were dating, what, a week?

489
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,886
And you had our entire future
mapped out for us?

490
00:41:39,654 --> 00:41:43,146
In my residency, you were picking out
real estate. I'd go to your house...

491
00:41:43,391 --> 00:41:46,656
...you'd have the entire town
in your house to meet me.

492
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:50,729
I do seem to remember that you made
pretty fast friends with one of them.

493
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:52,160
What are you talking about?

494
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,833
You know what
I'm talking about.

495
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:55,058
- That guy.
- What guy?

496
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:58,637
- The guy I caught you making out with.
- I wasn't making out with him.

497
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,933
What, are we in junior high school
right now?

498
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:03,133
What do you call it, then?

499
00:42:03,345 --> 00:42:05,939
A kiss.

500
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:10,174
It was just one kiss
with some random guy that just...

501
00:42:10,418 --> 00:42:11,749
Years... You know what?

502
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,478
Gentlemen...

503
00:42:13,688 --> 00:42:18,284
...unit 381 on Riviera Estates
is complete.

504
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:22,995
Congratulations.
You did a good job.

505
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:28,102
- One down...
- Forty-four to go.

506
00:42:28,303 --> 00:42:32,637
We're not terrifyingly behind schedule,
just alarmingly.

507
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,571
It'll be okay.
The guys are getting to know their job...

508
00:42:35,777 --> 00:42:38,007
...but we could use
another backhoe.

509
00:42:38,213 --> 00:42:40,113
And the water on 14
needs to be resealed.

510
00:42:40,315 --> 00:42:41,805
Shut up.

511
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,180
- What?
- I'm kind of disappointed in you.

512
00:42:45,387 --> 00:42:48,686
- Why?
- You're supposed to be on top of things.

513
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:52,621
- I thought I was.
- Well, you never noticed these.

514
00:42:53,828 --> 00:42:55,455
Remember?
You told me to get them.

515
00:42:55,797 --> 00:42:57,162
Right, right.

516
00:42:57,832 --> 00:42:59,697
Not exactly what I had in mind, but...

517
00:43:00,135 --> 00:43:02,365
- You like them?
- I like them.

518
00:43:02,604 --> 00:43:07,541
I think we should go out. Tonight.
If you're not doing any...

519
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,904
Jack? Jack.

520
00:43:10,145 --> 00:43:11,510
Hey, Jack.

521
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:16,881
Jack!

522
00:43:17,352 --> 00:43:19,343
Come on, Jack!

523
00:43:19,754 --> 00:43:22,484
Alex, wait for me!

524
00:43:23,124 --> 00:43:24,989
Jack!

525
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,998
Jack!

526
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,395
Jack!

527
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,647
Jack!

528
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:58,457
- Yours, I take it?
- Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Thanks.

529
00:43:58,693 --> 00:44:00,024
Come here, Jack.

530
00:44:00,195 --> 00:44:03,255
What were you thinking, huh, girl?
What were you thinking?

531
00:44:03,431 --> 00:44:06,423
- She's never run off like that.
- You gotta keep an eye on them.

532
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:08,727
- What's his name?
- Her. Jack.

533
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,030
Jack. It's a good name for a girl.

534
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:14,232
I should get one like you
for my girlfriend. She loves dogs.

535
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:17,104
- Hey, have we met before?
- No, don't think so.

536
00:44:17,312 --> 00:44:20,440
- Morgan Price.
- Alex Wyler.

537
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:22,774
- Hey, man, you need a hand with this?
- Yeah.

538
00:44:22,984 --> 00:44:24,383
- Okay.
- Lived here long?

539
00:44:24,586 --> 00:44:26,816
Just a few months.
I've got a place on the lake.

540
00:44:26,988 --> 00:44:30,389
- The lake, really? I've been thinking...
- Alex. Oh, good.

541
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:33,783
- Thank God you found him.
- Yeah.

542
00:44:33,995 --> 00:44:35,963
Mona, Morgan. Morgan, Mona.

543
00:44:36,197 --> 00:44:38,188
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

544
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,493
- It's good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

545
00:44:40,735 --> 00:44:42,134
Nice boots there.

546
00:44:42,337 --> 00:44:45,238
Just so you don't think
I'm gonna drink all this by myself...

547
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,137
...l'm having friends over tonight for
a party. You two are welcome to come.

548
00:44:50,578 --> 00:44:52,102
Oh, hey, Alex.

549
00:44:53,214 --> 00:44:55,079
Take my card. I might be looking...

550
00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:57,581
...to rent a place on the lake myself.
- Okay.

551
00:44:57,786 --> 00:45:01,017
It's Kate, my girlfriend,
she's never really liked this place...

552
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:05,590
...and I promised we'd look for something
new once she finishes her residency.

553
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,660
So if you hear of anything...

554
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:11,599
- Sure. She's a doctor?
- Yeah.

555
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:14,299
Alex.

556
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:23,243
- Great to meet you, Morgan.
- Great to meet you.

557
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:29,011
Hey, Morgan,
what time's that party at?

558
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,381
Eight o'clock. It's Kate's birthday.

559
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,687
It's Kate birthday.

560
00:45:39,894 --> 00:45:41,862
Come on, Jack.

561
00:46:08,857 --> 00:46:09,846
- Hi.
- Hi.

562
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:13,050
- What can I get you?
- Glass of white wine, please.

563
00:46:22,203 --> 00:46:24,535
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

564
00:46:44,759 --> 00:46:47,421
According to most accepted
social norms...

565
00:46:47,629 --> 00:46:51,759
...a person should not drink alone
after 10 p. M...

566
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:54,366
...unless they have a good excuse.

567
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:56,537
What's yours?

568
00:46:56,871 --> 00:46:59,101
Gosh, don't have one.

569
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,069
I do.

570
00:47:01,409 --> 00:47:04,469
My youngest left for college
this morning.

571
00:47:04,712 --> 00:47:06,475
Marie.

572
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:10,309
One day she's splashing
around a wading pool in diapers...

573
00:47:10,485 --> 00:47:14,785
...then she's packing up a Volvo
and driving to California.

574
00:47:15,757 --> 00:47:19,056
I just hope she knows
what she's getting into.

575
00:47:19,394 --> 00:47:20,918
Don't tell me.

576
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,097
- Premed?
- Bingo.

577
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:29,234
- Hey, how are you? Good to see you.
- I'm well, thanks.

578
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:31,428
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

579
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:34,437
Alex, Mona, the Wootch.

580
00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:36,338
- Susan, Johnny.
- Hi.

581
00:47:36,511 --> 00:47:39,309
Let's get you something to drink.
Come on. Bar's back here.

582
00:47:39,514 --> 00:47:41,675
Come on.
Hey, this is Marjorie.

583
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:43,978
Why didn't you mention it was today?

584
00:47:44,185 --> 00:47:46,312
We would have had a cake for you
or something.

585
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:48,421
Oh, it's just time passing.

586
00:47:48,623 --> 00:47:50,648
I hate making a big deal out of it.

587
00:47:50,892 --> 00:47:53,190
You keep a lot to yourself.

588
00:47:53,428 --> 00:47:55,623
Nothing wrong with it.

589
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,526
But I've sometimes wondered what else
you have in your life besides work.

590
00:48:00,768 --> 00:48:02,668
Family? Boyfriend?

591
00:48:02,904 --> 00:48:05,498
Well, I did. Once.

592
00:48:05,907 --> 00:48:08,432
<i>His name was Morgan.</i>

593
00:48:08,643 --> 00:48:10,941
<i>Morgan? Morgan.</i>

594
00:48:11,145 --> 00:48:13,443
<i>That's a sexy name.</i>

595
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,144
Surprise!

596
00:48:22,156 --> 00:48:24,488
Happy birthday, Kate.

597
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:28,959
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

598
00:48:30,031 --> 00:48:32,864
We got you.

599
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:35,696
- This is Kate, obviously.
- Hi, Kate.

600
00:48:40,575 --> 00:48:41,974
This is Alex and Mona.

601
00:48:42,744 --> 00:48:43,733
- Hi.
- Hi.

602
00:48:43,978 --> 00:48:46,071
This guy's gonna help us
find our lake house.

603
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:47,675
Right?

604
00:48:50,652 --> 00:48:52,176
You haven't had cake.

605
00:48:52,353 --> 00:48:54,753
<i>Anyway, well, I ended it.</i>

606
00:48:54,923 --> 00:48:59,087
And I'm happy now,
and it was the right thing to do.

607
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:03,262
So who is it you write to?

608
00:49:03,498 --> 00:49:06,661
I couldn't help... Every time you get
a break at the hospital...

609
00:49:06,834 --> 00:49:09,701
...you're writing something.
- There is someone.

610
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:13,272
It's kind of
a long-distance relationship.

611
00:49:13,608 --> 00:49:15,542
- How did you meet?
- We haven't.

612
00:49:15,743 --> 00:49:17,404
- What?
- No.

613
00:49:17,612 --> 00:49:19,773
- The story of my life.
- You're kidding.

614
00:49:19,948 --> 00:49:22,416
Keep everything at a distance.

615
00:49:22,617 --> 00:49:24,744
Everyone.

616
00:49:24,986 --> 00:49:26,851
The man who was standing
in front of me...

617
00:49:27,021 --> 00:49:28,784
...the one that wanted to marry me...

618
00:49:29,023 --> 00:49:31,423
...him, I push away. I run from him.

619
00:49:31,592 --> 00:49:34,527
In the meantime, the...

620
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:37,857
The one man I can never meet...

621
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:43,027
...him, I would like to give
my whole heart to.

622
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:47,867
He must write one hell of a letter.

623
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,377
It's nice.

624
00:49:52,046 --> 00:49:53,411
It's safe.

625
00:49:53,614 --> 00:49:55,946
- Christ, he's in prison, isn't he?
- No.

626
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,277
- You're one of those women, aren't you?
- No.

627
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:02,785
No, he's just a guy who lives on a lake.
He's an architect.

628
00:50:25,813 --> 00:50:27,747
Oh, my God.

629
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:35,680
Happy birthday.

630
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,289
Thank you.

631
00:50:39,994 --> 00:50:43,589
- I hope it's a great year for you.
- Thank you.

632
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:47,430
I'm Alex.

633
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,800
The lake-house guy.

634
00:50:50,004 --> 00:50:52,598
Oh, yeah. How you doing?

635
00:51:05,219 --> 00:51:06,811
May I?

636
00:51:14,195 --> 00:51:17,187
So you're gonna... You're gonna
find us a place on the lake, huh?

637
00:51:17,398 --> 00:51:18,695
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

638
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,231
If I can.

639
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,333
You're a real-estate agent?

640
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:26,530
No, l...
I just have a lake house.

641
00:51:27,608 --> 00:51:28,734
Is it nice?

642
00:51:28,976 --> 00:51:32,412
Yeah, you'll love it.
You're gonna rent it after I move out.

643
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:33,909
Oh, really?

644
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:42,018
Kate, have you...

645
00:51:42,723 --> 00:51:44,918
<i>...read Persuasion?</i>

646
00:51:48,763 --> 00:51:50,060
What?

647
00:51:50,264 --> 00:51:53,028
- By Jane Austen.
- I know who it's by.

648
00:51:53,835 --> 00:51:57,168
Yeah, it's...
It's my favorite book.

649
00:51:57,371 --> 00:52:00,704
Why did you bring something like that up?
What made you bring that up?

650
00:52:00,908 --> 00:52:05,675
I just... A friend of mine gave it
to me recently, and I was wondering...

651
00:52:06,247 --> 00:52:08,181
...what it was about.

652
00:52:09,884 --> 00:52:11,943
It's... It's wonderful.

653
00:52:12,186 --> 00:52:13,710
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

654
00:52:13,921 --> 00:52:16,014
It's about...

655
00:52:17,158 --> 00:52:19,023
About waiting.

656
00:52:21,896 --> 00:52:24,387
These two people, they...
They... They meet.

657
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:28,797
They almost fall in love,
but the timing isn't right.

658
00:52:29,036 --> 00:52:31,266
They... They have to part.

659
00:52:31,572 --> 00:52:33,403
And then...

660
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:35,742
...years later, they...
They meet again.

661
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:38,241
They get another chance.

662
00:52:39,947 --> 00:52:43,678
You know, but they don't know
if too much time has passed.

663
00:52:43,885 --> 00:52:46,615
If they waited too long, if it's...

664
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:51,121
...you know,
too late to make it work.

665
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:57,297
Why do you like that?

666
00:52:57,498 --> 00:52:59,398
I don't know.

667
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,966
Don't get me wrong.
It's beautiful in a kind of...

668
00:53:02,203 --> 00:53:05,263
- No, it's terrible.
- It's terrible.

669
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:08,738
- That's terrible.
- It's terrible.

670
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:10,568
That's...

671
00:53:10,778 --> 00:53:13,474
Yeah, it's... That's terrible.

672
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,746
It's a personal question...

673
00:53:16,951 --> 00:53:21,285
...but have you ever been
through anything like that?

674
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,356
- Me? No. No, no.
- No.

675
00:53:30,298 --> 00:53:32,129
When I was...

676
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:34,997
When I was 16...

677
00:53:36,537 --> 00:53:40,303
...I was completely in love
with this guy.

678
00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:43,300
He played guitar...

679
00:53:44,345 --> 00:53:46,176
...and I ran away from home...

680
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,941
...and went to San Francisco
so I could go live with him.

681
00:53:51,152 --> 00:53:54,383
Yeah, he convinced me
I had a beautiful voice...

682
00:53:55,856 --> 00:53:58,654
...and I dreamed of becoming a singer.

683
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:01,988
I love San Francisco.

684
00:54:02,196 --> 00:54:05,131
Yeah, he was...
He was my first love.

685
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:08,799
Probably the only one.

686
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:14,468
- He must have been a great guy.
- I don't... I don't know, l...

687
00:54:14,775 --> 00:54:18,006
He may have been. It didn't last
long enough for me to find out.

688
00:54:18,212 --> 00:54:21,010
Yeah. Truth is, l...

689
00:54:21,282 --> 00:54:24,149
I can't even remember
what he looked like.

690
00:54:24,685 --> 00:54:26,380
- Really?
- Yeah.

691
00:54:26,587 --> 00:54:28,282
Then that's too bad.

692
00:54:28,489 --> 00:54:31,822
My dad... My dad showed up, actually.

693
00:54:32,026 --> 00:54:33,550
- You were in trouble.
- He came in.

694
00:54:33,794 --> 00:54:37,321
Yeah, I was in trouble.
He yanked me back to Chicago.

695
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,495
Yeah.

696
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:43,025
And he was sick, and he...

697
00:54:43,237 --> 00:54:48,300
He had these... These dreams
of me becoming a doctor, you know?

698
00:54:50,945 --> 00:54:54,904
You know, and eventually,
they became my dreams too.

699
00:54:58,052 --> 00:54:59,952
He was right.

700
00:55:01,122 --> 00:55:04,216
You know, l...
I feel good helping people.

701
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,692
Then he died.

702
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:20,570
Kate.

703
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,707
What?

704
00:55:32,953 --> 00:55:35,080
I...

705
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:39,582
You?

706
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,624
I just...

707
00:55:47,868 --> 00:55:49,495
What?

708
00:55:53,774 --> 00:55:55,867
Do you know this song?

709
00:55:58,112 --> 00:55:59,773
Yeah.

710
00:56:04,418 --> 00:56:07,410
- Do you sing?
- No.

711
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:10,818
Nobody wants to hear me sing.
You don't wanna hear me sing.

712
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:14,821
I... I didn't mean, you know...

713
00:56:17,264 --> 00:56:19,255
But, yeah.

714
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:25,531
But I can dance.

715
00:58:46,247 --> 00:58:47,737
Kate.

716
00:58:49,416 --> 00:58:50,940
Hey.

717
00:58:51,418 --> 00:58:55,650
Alex was... Alex was just telling me
about the... The lake house.

718
00:58:57,291 --> 00:59:01,125
- Yeah, it sounds... Sounds really great.
- Great.

719
00:59:02,162 --> 00:59:04,130
Alex, it's late.

720
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,596
Yeah.

721
00:59:07,801 --> 00:59:09,462
Yeah.

722
00:59:10,137 --> 00:59:12,662
- Good night.
- Good night.

723
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:27,570
It was you.

724
00:59:27,782 --> 00:59:30,148
- You working tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

725
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:32,285
Why didn't you say anything?

726
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:36,388
You would've thought
I was crazy or drunk. Or both.

727
00:59:36,624 --> 00:59:38,353
Yeah, but...

728
00:59:39,126 --> 00:59:41,526
...I liked you.
You should have said something.

729
00:59:41,729 --> 00:59:44,596
How? You were with your boyfriend.

730
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:47,700
You know what? Excuses, excuses.
You are a coward.

731
00:59:47,902 --> 00:59:49,802
I'm not a coward.

732
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:53,906
Oh, really?
Well, what about your girlfriend?

733
00:59:54,408 --> 00:59:56,239
What? I told you already...

734
00:59:56,477 --> 00:59:59,605
...she's not my girlfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend either.

735
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:03,510
Oh, really? Well, what is he, then?
Your brother?

736
01:00:04,385 --> 01:00:09,322
We have a comedian. What'd you have,
a clown for breakfast this morning?

737
01:00:10,992 --> 01:00:13,051
Wonderful. Our first fight.

738
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:17,219
You could write a song about it
and go sing it in San Francisco.

739
01:00:21,502 --> 01:00:23,265
What?

740
01:00:23,671 --> 01:00:25,138
Hello.

741
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:27,273
Hey, Henry.

742
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:30,040
What?

743
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:32,076
You'll let me know if you need anything?

744
01:00:32,279 --> 01:00:34,076
Yes, I will.

745
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:36,405
- Hi.
- Good afternoon.

746
01:00:36,651 --> 01:00:40,382
I'm looking for my father. I don't know
which room he's in. Simon Wyler?

747
01:00:40,588 --> 01:00:43,386
- Mr. Wyler, the architect?
- Yes.

748
01:00:43,591 --> 01:00:46,719
I'm Anna Klyczynski.
I'm the Attending for your father.

749
01:00:46,927 --> 01:00:49,088
Hey. What happened? How is he?

750
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:53,790
He's okay. He's had a heart attack.
Fortunately, relatively minor.

751
01:00:54,035 --> 01:00:57,198
His vitals are fine and he's stable...

752
01:00:57,371 --> 01:00:59,464
...but it will require an intervention.

753
01:00:59,707 --> 01:01:02,733
He's agreed to schedule it
for tomorrow.

754
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:20,454
Good to see you're taking it easy.

755
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:25,323
Well, you... You didn't need to come.
I'm perfectly well.

756
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,759
Perfectly all right.

757
01:01:27,968 --> 01:01:30,402
Well, you had a heart attack, Dad.

758
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,937
I had an episode, for chrissake.

759
01:01:34,141 --> 01:01:36,075
Nothing more.

760
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:40,110
Appreciate it if you kept everything
in its perspective.

761
01:01:42,316 --> 01:01:45,717
Well then, I just wanna let you know
I'm here if you need anything.

762
01:01:47,855 --> 01:01:49,652
Coffee.

763
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:51,786
What?

764
01:01:52,226 --> 01:01:54,023
You heard me.

765
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,261
Coffee.

766
01:02:00,101 --> 01:02:02,331
<i>There's something
I never told you, Kate.</i>

767
01:02:02,536 --> 01:02:05,004
<i>You see, it was my father
who built the lake house.</i>

768
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:08,265
<i>I mean, with his own hands.</i>

769
01:02:08,476 --> 01:02:11,309
<i>And it was a long time ago,
before he was famous...</i>

770
01:02:11,512 --> 01:02:14,743
<i>... when he still had a family
and worshipped my mother.</i>

771
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:18,749
<i>Her name was Mary,
and the house was a gift for her.</i>

772
01:02:18,953 --> 01:02:21,786
<i>She was smart and funny.</i>

773
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:25,652
<i>She could have done anything, but chose
to take care of my brother and I...</i>

774
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,657
<i>... and help him build his career.</i>

775
01:02:27,862 --> 01:02:31,889
<i>You see, the more successful he became,
the more impossible he was to live with.</i>

776
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:35,694
<i>Finally, she just couldn't take
living with him anymore.</i>

777
01:02:35,903 --> 01:02:38,838
<i>She left him.</i>

778
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,166
<i>Within a year, she got sick.</i>

779
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:45,038
<i>Unfortunately, she never learned
how to stop loving him.</i>

780
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,680
<i>He wasn't at the funeral.</i>

781
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:52,281
<i>When I asked him why...</i>

782
01:02:58,025 --> 01:03:00,823
Go on, Alex. What did he say?

783
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:08,530
He said, "She was dead to me the
moment she stepped out of the house."

784
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:15,839
And then he gave me
one of his architect-of-the-year grins.

785
01:03:30,858 --> 01:03:32,120
I hope you appreciate this.

786
01:03:32,359 --> 01:03:35,089
I had to sneak past
three nurses and your Attending.

787
01:03:35,329 --> 01:03:37,627
Oh, jeez, it's hot.

788
01:03:37,965 --> 01:03:39,364
It's not decaf, is it?

789
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:41,432
It should be, but it isn't.

790
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:47,767
That's not bad. Thank you...

791
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:49,602
<i>: : :son:</i>

792
01:03:49,844 --> 01:03:52,938
- You're welcome.
- Where's your brother?

793
01:03:53,113 --> 01:03:55,240
I sent him away.
He wasn't feeling well.

794
01:03:55,449 --> 01:03:58,350
- You know how he is, he worries.
- Yeah, I know.

795
01:03:58,552 --> 01:04:00,645
He gets that from your mother,
I'm afraid.

796
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:02,889
She always worried too much.

797
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,785
What are you looking at?

798
01:04:05,593 --> 01:04:07,390
Oh, yeah, here, take a gander.

799
01:04:07,595 --> 01:04:10,962
It's a proposal for a museum.

800
01:04:11,165 --> 01:04:14,362
- Who is it?
- Someone new.

801
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:18,568
Oh, I like the walkways,
where the light falls.

802
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,399
What are the materials?

803
01:04:20,808 --> 01:04:22,799
Granite. Aluminum.

804
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:25,478
White panels
are straight out of Meier...

805
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:30,013
...but the interior color coming through
the front windows, that's different.

806
01:04:30,851 --> 01:04:34,184
It's not new,
but it's clean, uncluttered.

807
01:04:34,421 --> 01:04:36,116
I like it.

808
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:39,750
When was the last time
you were in Barcelona?

809
01:04:41,528 --> 01:04:43,996
Years ago, with you, Mom and Henry.

810
01:04:44,198 --> 01:04:46,826
Do you remember visiting
Casa de la Caritat?

811
01:04:48,002 --> 01:04:49,629
The almshouse.

812
01:04:49,837 --> 01:04:52,305
That's right. You mentioned Meier.

813
01:04:52,506 --> 01:04:57,409
His Barcelona museum stands
in the same area as Casa de la Caritat.

814
01:04:57,611 --> 01:04:59,602
It drinks the same light.

815
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:04,716
Meier designed a series of louvered
skylights to capture that light...

816
01:05:04,952 --> 01:05:09,719
...and cast it inward to illuminate
the art within, but indirectly.

817
01:05:09,957 --> 01:05:14,951
And that was important,
because although light enhances art...

818
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:19,963
...it can also degrade it. But you know
all that already, you son of a gun.

819
01:05:20,134 --> 01:05:22,034
Now, this...

820
01:05:23,971 --> 01:05:25,996
...where do you suppose
this is to be built?

821
01:05:26,173 --> 01:05:27,231
I have no idea.

822
01:05:27,408 --> 01:05:29,842
- Oh, but you said you liked it.
- Conceptually.

823
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,240
Now, come on.

824
01:05:32,479 --> 01:05:35,141
You know as well as I do
that the light in Barcelona...

825
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,715
...is quite different
from the light in Tokyo.

826
01:05:37,885 --> 01:05:40,979
And the light in Tokyo
is different from that in Prague.

827
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:47,184
A truly great structure, one that
is meant to stand the tests of time...

828
01:05:47,394 --> 01:05:49,885
...never disregards its environment.

829
01:05:50,097 --> 01:05:51,894
An architect takes that into account.

830
01:05:52,099 --> 01:05:56,832
He knows that if he wants presence,
he must consult with nature.

831
01:05:57,037 --> 01:06:01,440
He must be captivated by the light.

832
01:06:01,608 --> 01:06:05,339
Always the light. Always.

833
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,232
Hey. I have an emergency.
Take my shift. Please.

834
01:07:08,242 --> 01:07:09,766
Hello.

835
01:07:09,977 --> 01:07:12,605
<i>- Mr. Wyler?
- Yes.</i>

836
01:07:12,813 --> 01:07:16,010
<i>This is Dr. Klyczynski
at Chicago City Hospital.</i>

837
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:20,242
<i>I'm afraid I have some
difficult news for you.</i>

838
01:07:23,057 --> 01:07:25,617
<i>I'm so sorry, Alex.</i>

839
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,954
<i>I wish somehow
I could be there with you...</i>

840
01:07:30,497 --> 01:07:34,194
<i>... that we could sit together and look
out over the water and the light...</i>

841
01:07:34,435 --> 01:07:37,336
<i>... in this house your father built.</i>

842
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:43,207
<i>I could be a shoulder for you
like you've been for me.</i>

843
01:07:43,444 --> 01:07:46,572
<i>And tell you that
everything is gonna be okay.</i>

844
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:51,315
<i>If I could do one thing for you today...</i>

845
01:07:51,518 --> 01:07:53,577
<i>... from here...</i>

846
01:07:53,787 --> 01:07:57,382
<i>... one small, simple thing
from the future...</i>

847
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,982
<i>... I hope this is it.</i>

848
01:08:01,395 --> 01:08:04,125
<i>It won't be published
for a couple of years...</i>

849
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:06,993
<i>... but I don't think
you should have to wait that long.</i>

850
01:08:08,702 --> 01:08:11,671
<i>I hope it helps you know
how much you were loved.</i>

851
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,509
Pick a place. I'll be there, I promise.

852
01:09:58,745 --> 01:10:00,076
Tomorrow, what do you say?

853
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,111
But, Alex,
it won't be tomorrow for you.

854
01:10:02,316 --> 01:10:05,717
- You're gonna have to wait two years.
- I know, I don't care. I'll wait.

855
01:10:05,919 --> 01:10:07,250
Are you sure? I don't know.

856
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:09,922
I do. I've never been so sure
of anything in my life.

857
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,251
Okay. I'll see you in two years, then.

858
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,724
See you tomorrow, then.

859
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,824
Kate...

860
01:10:18,031 --> 01:10:20,022
...where would you like to go?

861
01:10:22,836 --> 01:10:24,497
II Mare.

862
01:10:24,671 --> 01:10:26,662
When were you hoping
to dine with us?

863
01:10:26,873 --> 01:10:28,465
Two years from tomorrow.

864
01:10:28,675 --> 01:10:30,836
- Two years from tomorrow?
- Yeah.

865
01:10:31,044 --> 01:10:33,012
- Two years?
- From tomorrow.

866
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:36,973
- Hi.
- Hello. Name?

867
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,276
Forster.

868
01:10:38,452 --> 01:10:39,817
- Can I have your name?
- Wyler.

869
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:42,547
Or Wyler, I'm...
I'm really not sure.

870
01:10:42,723 --> 01:10:44,953
I think we should be able
to accommodate you.

871
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,216
- Great.
- Wyler?

872
01:10:48,395 --> 01:10:49,885
Wyler.

873
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:53,999
Your waiter will be right with you.

874
01:11:18,158 --> 01:11:20,319
Good evening, miss.

875
01:11:21,995 --> 01:11:24,429
Complimentary.

876
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:37,541
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

877
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,566
Another glass for the lady?

878
01:13:30,223 --> 01:13:32,316
<i>You weren't there.</i>

879
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:34,854
<i>You didn't come.</i>

880
01:13:41,234 --> 01:13:43,031
I don't understand.

881
01:13:43,236 --> 01:13:46,364
<i>Something must have happened.
I'm sorry.</i>

882
01:13:46,573 --> 01:13:49,440
<i>I've got two years, Kate.
We can try again.</i>

883
01:13:49,643 --> 01:13:53,875
<i>No, Alex, it's too late.</i>

884
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,675
<i>It already happened. It didn't work.</i>

885
01:13:57,884 --> 01:13:59,818
<i>Don't give up on me, Kate.</i>

886
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:03,717
<i>What about Persuasion?
You told me. They wait.</i>

887
01:14:03,957 --> 01:14:05,982
<i>They meet again,
they have another chance.</i>

888
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:08,320
<i>Life is not a book, Alex.</i>

889
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:11,019
<i>And it can be over in a second.</i>

890
01:14:11,231 --> 01:14:14,598
<i>I was having lunch with my mother
at Daley Plaza...</i>

891
01:14:14,835 --> 01:14:17,565
<i>... and a man was killed
right in front of me.</i>

892
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:20,001
<i>He died in my arms.</i>

893
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:21,731
<i>And I thought:</i>

894
01:14:21,975 --> 01:14:26,241
<i>"It can't end just like that
on Valentine's Day. "</i>

895
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:30,172
<i>I thought about all the people
who love him, waiting at home...</i>

896
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,874
<i>... who will never see him again.</i>

897
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:35,721
<i>And then I thought:</i>

898
01:14:35,922 --> 01:14:38,254
<i>"What if there is no one?"</i>

899
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:44,554
<i>What if you live your whole life
and no one is waiting?</i>

900
01:14:45,065 --> 01:14:49,001
<i>So I drove to the lake house
looking for any kind of answer.</i>

901
01:14:49,202 --> 01:14:51,602
<i>And I found you.</i>

902
01:14:51,805 --> 01:14:54,239
<i>And I let myself get lost.</i>

903
01:14:54,441 --> 01:14:59,811
<i>Lost in this beautiful fantasy
where time stood still.</i>

904
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,646
<i>But it's not real, Alex.</i>

905
01:15:02,883 --> 01:15:07,820
<i>I have to learn to live
the life that I have got.</i>

906
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,617
<i>Please don't write anymore.</i>

907
01:15:11,825 --> 01:15:14,123
<i>Don't try to find me.</i>

908
01:15:15,061 --> 01:15:17,723
<i>Let me let you go.</i>

909
01:16:05,111 --> 01:16:06,942
Hello.

910
01:16:07,714 --> 01:16:10,649
What? Sorry, hold on.
I can't hear you. I'll be back, sorry.

911
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:13,512
Hello. Hold on. Hold on.

912
01:16:13,954 --> 01:16:15,649
Hello.

913
01:16:16,882 --> 01:16:18,645
Hi.

914
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,693
How long are you here?

915
01:16:30,904 --> 01:16:34,237
- I'm at a bar with some friends.
- Come.

916
01:16:34,474 --> 01:16:37,034
Well, don't get too excited.

917
01:16:38,478 --> 01:16:41,038
I find that hard to believe.

918
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:44,483
It is good.

919
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:47,676
And it was really good
to hear your voice.

920
01:16:47,887 --> 01:16:51,220
I was surprised how good
it was to hear your voice.

921
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:55,851
So how was your meeting?

922
01:16:56,062 --> 01:16:58,189
- It was good.
- Yeah?

923
01:16:58,398 --> 01:17:01,231
Yeah, l... I got the job.

924
01:17:01,434 --> 01:17:03,766
- Really?
- Yeah.

925
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:06,365
- Well, congratulations.
- Imagine that.

926
01:17:06,573 --> 01:17:12,205
Yeah. A telecom company.
I'll be in-house counsel. Pays well.

927
01:17:12,412 --> 01:17:14,505
And it's here...

928
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,181
...in Chicago.

929
01:17:17,017 --> 01:17:18,746
Well...

930
01:17:18,952 --> 01:17:21,045
...it's great news.

931
01:17:23,423 --> 01:17:25,220
Hey.

932
01:17:29,195 --> 01:17:30,890
What?

933
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:52,574
Jack.

934
01:17:52,786 --> 01:17:54,720
Hey, Jack.

935
01:17:55,055 --> 01:17:56,818
Jack.

936
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:19,534
Are you gonna
come down this weekend?

937
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:23,903
Don't you miss me a little bit?

938
01:19:24,577 --> 01:19:27,045
Oh, just a little bit. Not a lot, huh?

939
01:19:27,514 --> 01:19:31,177
Okay. No, I heard you. Yeah.

940
01:19:33,052 --> 01:19:36,317
Kate, I'm gonna
have to call you back, okay?

941
01:19:51,171 --> 01:19:53,605
Still wanna rent a lake house?

942
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:56,873
It's what Kate wants.

943
01:19:57,076 --> 01:19:59,670
How the hell do you know
what Kate wants?

944
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:02,708
Trust me.

945
01:20:14,594 --> 01:20:17,722
Hey, you. I know you.

946
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:26,766
Whatever you want out back.

947
01:20:56,669 --> 01:20:58,500
What do you think?

948
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:01,232
You're fixating. You know?

949
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:04,106
Why do you keep
tweaking the lake house?

950
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,403
Why don't you do your own work?

951
01:21:06,579 --> 01:21:08,809
Because it's hers.

952
01:21:09,182 --> 01:21:14,449
You're talking about the girl
from the future.

953
01:21:14,654 --> 01:21:16,315
Kate.

954
01:21:17,156 --> 01:21:19,920
And you're still writing with Kate?

955
01:21:20,293 --> 01:21:23,660
- No.
- Why not?

956
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:26,689
She asked me not to.

957
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,095
Why?

958
01:21:31,404 --> 01:21:33,099
Time.

959
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:38,534
Hey, come on.

960
01:21:38,778 --> 01:21:42,509
This is a good thing.
You know, you need a real woman.

961
01:21:42,715 --> 01:21:45,809
- A woman...
- Henry, listen.

962
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,817
Listen to me.

963
01:21:49,289 --> 01:21:54,283
While it lasted, she was
more real to me than any of that stuff.

964
01:21:54,494 --> 01:21:58,624
She was more real to me
than anything I've ever known.

965
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,664
I saw her.

966
01:22:03,536 --> 01:22:05,367
I kissed her.

967
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,367
I love her.

968
01:22:12,545 --> 01:22:14,638
And now she's gone.

969
01:22:23,556 --> 01:22:25,319
She's gone.

970
01:22:32,732 --> 01:22:34,359
<i>And Duckett squirts through.</i>

971
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,562
<i>First thing...</i>

972
01:22:38,104 --> 01:22:40,470
<i>How could the Ab Scissor
four-minute ab machine...?</i>

973
01:22:40,673 --> 01:22:43,335
<i>- and your potatoes
cooking on the top.</i>

974
01:22:43,543 --> 01:22:47,104
<i>It's nice out here. Let's stay here.</i>

975
01:22:47,347 --> 01:22:49,212
<i>But we have to eat.</i>

976
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:53,413
<i>We can eat here. I'll cook.</i>

977
01:22:53,786 --> 01:22:56,050
<i>I thought you didn't like to cook.</i>

978
01:22:56,689 --> 01:22:58,987
<i>No, I don't like to cook.</i>

979
01:23:00,626 --> 01:23:03,925
<i>But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.</i>

980
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:06,257
<i>What about all
the washing-up afterward?</i>

981
01:23:06,499 --> 01:23:09,059
<i>- We'll eat with our fingers.
- Could you turn that down?</i>

982
01:23:09,268 --> 01:23:10,701
<i>Don't we need any plates?</i>

983
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:14,600
<i>Yes. One for you,
and one for...</i>

984
01:24:26,212 --> 01:24:29,648
"There could have been
no two hearts so open...

985
01:24:30,316 --> 01:24:33,114
...no tastes so similar...

986
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,221
...no feelings so in unison."

987
01:24:51,804 --> 01:24:56,639
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

988
01:24:56,843 --> 01:25:01,337
...five, four, three, two, one.

989
01:25:01,547 --> 01:25:04,414
Happy New Year!

990
01:25:16,996 --> 01:25:18,759
Come in.

991
01:25:32,337 --> 01:25:33,964
Hi.

992
01:25:34,472 --> 01:25:35,962
Hi.

993
01:25:38,784 --> 01:25:40,217
What do you think?

994
01:25:40,419 --> 01:25:42,284
This is what I gave up lunch for?

995
01:25:42,522 --> 01:25:47,255
- I know it needs work.
- Work? How about a wrecking ball?

996
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,586
I found an architect
who specializes in renovations.

997
01:25:50,796 --> 01:25:53,230
I made an appointment for tomorrow.

998
01:25:57,737 --> 01:25:59,295
Ambush.

999
01:25:59,539 --> 01:26:00,801
Come on.

1000
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,532
We can't stay in my apartment.
We've been there over a year.

1001
01:26:05,678 --> 01:26:07,407
I wanna keep moving forward.

1002
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:21,289
- It's a new firm.
- "New" as in inexperienced?

1003
01:26:21,494 --> 01:26:24,258
No. "New" as in cheap.

1004
01:26:34,473 --> 01:26:36,839
Hi, Dr. Forster.
We'll be with you in a moment.

1005
01:26:37,076 --> 01:26:38,771
Great, thank you.

1006
01:26:52,525 --> 01:26:55,619
Oh, by the way...

1007
01:26:57,029 --> 01:26:59,156
...happy Valentine's Day.

1008
01:26:59,365 --> 01:27:02,493
Oh, God, Katie,
I didn't get you anything.

1009
01:27:02,735 --> 01:27:05,863
I'm sorry. I've just been
so swamped and...

1010
01:27:06,105 --> 01:27:08,005
Doesn't matter.

1011
01:27:24,523 --> 01:27:28,289
- What is this?
- It's global warming.

1012
01:27:30,529 --> 01:27:34,522
Dr. Forster?
Hi, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

1013
01:27:53,319 --> 01:27:55,753
- Hi. Good to see you again.
- Dr. Forster. You too.

1014
01:27:55,988 --> 01:27:58,889
- Hi, I'm Morgan.
- Hey, Morgan. Vanessa Vanderbeck.

1015
01:27:59,091 --> 01:28:03,391
So obviously, the first thing you see
is what we had talked about. The atrium.

1016
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,495
That's stunning.

1017
01:28:05,665 --> 01:28:09,192
So we were able to do it with all
the glass panels in the metal structure?

1018
01:28:09,402 --> 01:28:10,994
- Yeah.
- Can l...?

1019
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:12,567
Wanna get a beer after work?

1020
01:28:12,805 --> 01:28:16,866
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm taking
Vanessa out for Valentine's Day.

1021
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:22,069
Wait.

1022
01:28:22,615 --> 01:28:24,048
Say that again.

1023
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:27,378
It's Valentine's Day today.
I'm taking out Vanessa, my girlfriend.

1024
01:28:27,586 --> 01:28:30,953
Cold champagne, some oysters,
maybe a little chocolate.

1025
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:34,682
- What's the date?
- It's February 14th.

1026
01:28:35,594 --> 01:28:39,860
- February 14th, 2006.
- Yeah.

1027
01:28:40,466 --> 01:28:43,333
- Stunning. Thank you so much.
- Our pleasure.

1028
01:28:43,536 --> 01:28:45,970
Thank you. Henry will
make sure you have everything.

1029
01:28:46,205 --> 01:28:48,105
Great. They were absolutely beautiful.

1030
01:28:48,341 --> 01:28:49,831
Thank you.

1031
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:52,600
What?

1032
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,379
Katie, I gotta get back to work.

1033
01:29:00,353 --> 01:29:02,218
Who did this drawing?

1034
01:29:02,421 --> 01:29:04,548
My brother did, actually.

1035
01:29:04,724 --> 01:29:06,089
Who's your brother?

1036
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:08,283
Alex Wyler.

1037
01:29:08,594 --> 01:29:10,357
Did you know him?

1038
01:29:12,498 --> 01:29:14,056
Yeah.

1039
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,763
Yeah, I know him.

1040
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,466
Do you know how
I can get in touch with him?

1041
01:29:21,674 --> 01:29:24,575
Is he...?
Is he anywhere that I can?

1042
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,144
I'm sorry.

1043
01:29:29,782 --> 01:29:33,809
He died...

1044
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:36,982
...two years ago today, actually.

1045
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,385
There was an accident.

1046
01:30:00,045 --> 01:30:01,637
Where?

1047
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:06,807
Kate.

1048
01:30:09,188 --> 01:30:11,622
Wait, just stop. Just stop.

1049
01:30:12,124 --> 01:30:14,217
Goddamn it, answer me.

1050
01:30:14,527 --> 01:30:18,554
What is the matter? Kate.

1051
01:30:21,233 --> 01:30:22,791
Kate!

1052
01:31:27,233 --> 01:31:30,259
Sixty degrees on Valentine's Day.

1053
01:31:30,503 --> 01:31:32,801
This cannot be Chicago.

1054
01:31:33,205 --> 01:31:36,231
The TV says it's global warming.

1055
01:31:36,609 --> 01:31:38,372
Nothing wrong with that.

1056
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:40,306
It's a dangerous thing.

1057
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:42,441
<i>Alex...</i>

1058
01:31:43,883 --> 01:31:46,784
<i>... I know why you
didn't show up that night.</i>

1059
01:31:47,019 --> 01:31:50,284
<i>It was you at Daley Plaza that day.</i>

1060
01:31:51,457 --> 01:31:53,254
<i>It was you.</i>

1061
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:56,218
<i>Please, don't go.</i>

1062
01:31:57,296 --> 01:32:00,754
<i>Just wait. Please.</i>

1063
01:32:01,734 --> 01:32:03,099
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

1064
01:32:03,302 --> 01:32:05,634
<i>Don't try to find me.</i>

1065
01:32:07,806 --> 01:32:09,671
<i>I love you.</i>

1066
01:32:12,511 --> 01:32:16,140
<i>And it's taken me all this time
to say it, but I love you.</i>

1067
01:32:23,656 --> 01:32:25,283
<i>And if you still care for me...</i>

1068
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:29,093
<i>... wait for me.</i>

1069
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:31,619
<i>Wait with me.</i>

1070
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:35,322
<i>Just wait. Wait.</i>

1071
01:32:44,076 --> 01:32:46,476
<i>Wait two years, Alex.</i>

1072
01:32:46,946 --> 01:32:49,278
<i>Come to the lake house.</i>

1073
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:51,479
<i>I'm here.</i>

1074
01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:50,505
You waited.

1075
