1
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:07,083
Martha and Carl Brodie, mother and son.

2
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:09,409
No one's seen them since Tuesday.

3
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,323
The car is a Trans-Am,
blue with yellow pinstriping.

4
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,776
California license: 2CLG592.

5
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,564
No one's seen that since Tuesday either.

6
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,897
God, I just hope nothing horrible
happened to them. They were so close!

7
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,057
Ma'am, please, step back.

8
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,071
Sheriff? What do you think happened?

9
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,957
I don't know,
but somebody sure doesn't like cats.

10
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:55,346
Shit!

11
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:13,647
Looks like the place has been empty
for 100 years.

12
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:15,660
Well, it hasn't.

13
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,900
What the hell was that?

14
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:12,250
Jesus!

15
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:15,530
It's a little girl.

16
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,011
What's that in her hair?

17
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:25,665
A rose.

18
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:54,563
Tanya.

19
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,612
Hi!

20
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:25,385
He can't hear us.

21
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:30,626
Shoot!

22
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:34,086
Come on! lt'll be back.

23
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:37,479
You always get them sooner or later.

24
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:40,006
Dance with me.

25
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:41,620
I don't want to dance.

26
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:43,939
Sure you do. You love this one.

27
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:17,801
What's for dinner?

28
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:21,829
Roast chicken and cranberry dressing.
Pumpkin pie for dessert.

29
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:26,182
You going anywhere tonight?

30
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:27,742
To the movies maybe.

31
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:30,762
With a friend? With a special friend?

32
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:33,089
All by my lonesome.

33
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:36,509
Don't ask your mother.

34
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,184
Actually there's a girl that works there.
I thought I might ask her out.

35
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,823
You might?

36
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:49,797
She's pretty, too.

37
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,597
Is she nice?

38
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:56,531
I don't know. I guess I'll find out, won't I?

39
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:02,718
Jealous?

40
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:04,291
Concerned.

41
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:08,177
Right.

42
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:12,611
Concerned.

43
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:16,892
Concerned.

44
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,359
Should I be jealous?

45
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:35,606
Do you like that?

46
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,600
Mother.

47
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:12,996
-You scared me.
-I'm sorry.

48
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,129
No. I'll take that.

49
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:21,349
Charles Brady.

50
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,043
-Thanks for the help, Charles Brady.
-Don't mention it.

51
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,803
Could I get a popcorn
and a medium Mr. Pib, please?

52
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,257
Yes.

53
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,377
I'm very embarrassed. Am I blushing?

54
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,125
You look good in red, Tanya.

55
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:49,898
How'd you know my name?

56
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:54,265
English. Period 4, Creative Writing,
Mr. Fallows, the Weird and Terrible.

57
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,285
You're the new guy from Ohio?

58
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,478
Paradise Falls.

59
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:17,086
-Go ahead.
-You mean, free?

60
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:22,453
Thanks!

61
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:27,494
I don't suppose you'd like a ride home
after work tonight, would you?

62
00:13:29,713 --> 00:13:31,613
-My dad picks me up.
-Nice dad.

63
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,680
Besides, what would your girlfriend say
if you gave the popcorn girl a ride home?

64
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,067
No girlfriend. I'm new in town, remember?

65
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:45,041
Thanks. I'll see you in class.

66
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:48,755
Wait!

67
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:54,268
Welcome to Travis.

68
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:57,328
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

69
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:24,836
Hi!

70
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:26,450
I'm okay.

71
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:28,524
How's my girl?

72
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,183
-I'm good, Dad.
-Good. Fasten your seat belt.

73
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,467
It's my son, Officer.

74
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,040
A cat?

75
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,414
Had himself one hissy fit, I'll tell you.

76
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,754
I'm sorry, Officer. It's late,
but this allergy is so severe.

77
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:34,975
Yeah, I know. I got one, too.
Mine's to the IRS.

78
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,187
Y'all have a good night.

79
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,961
Thank you, Officer.

80
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:47,789
It just ignored the trap.
It was right by the window.

81
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,615
It's okay. It's gone now.

82
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:55,663
I'll set some more traps in the morning.

83
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:07,936
Did you bring me anything?

84
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:10,017
Anything special in mind?

85
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:14,950
Am I beautiful?

86
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:17,924
You're always beautiful, Mother.

87
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:22,551
So, did you ask this mystery girl out?

88
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:28,184
What kind of a girl would go out
with a guy she just met?

89
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,778
Not a very nice one, I suppose.

90
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:36,491
-Another one?
-Goddamn cats.

91
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:38,871
Don't swear, Mother!

92
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:43,945
You make sure you ask her out tomorrow.

93
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:49,272
What's her name?

94
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,392
Tanya Robertson.

95
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,472
Is she nice?

96
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:58,453
She's nice.

97
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:01,966
I'm sure of it.

98
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,806
-She's pure.
-Good.

99
00:17:07,246 --> 00:17:08,613
I'm famished, Charles.

100
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,601
"It was sleepwalkers,
hiding in human robes...

101
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:28,235
"...feeding on virtue.

102
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,661
"Loving to feed, feeding to breed.

103
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:34,855
"So, in the end, they ran.

104
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:38,362
"In the end,
Robbie and his mother always had to run.

105
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:41,436
"For one night, the men would come
in their old cars...

106
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:44,868
"...men with lights and guns.
And to the boy and his mother...

107
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:49,008
"...their curses and their screams of rage
always sound the same...

108
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,243
"...like the laughter of cruel gods.
The time of happiness...

109
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:57,563
"...too brief to be anything but golden,
had run out."

110
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,483
Very good, Charles. Very good.

111
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:08,483
Your teachers in Ohio must have been
sorry to lose such a creative young man.

112
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:11,050
I beg your pardon, Mr. Fallows?

113
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,358
Isn't that where you transferred from?
Ohio?

114
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,390
Yes, it is.

115
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:21,331
Shit!

116
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:34,505
I suggest that next time,
you keep your hands to yourself.

117
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:36,385
Yes, sir!

118
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:39,632
Asshole.

119
00:18:41,171 --> 00:18:43,638
Any thoughts on Mr. Brady's Sleepwalkers?

120
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:47,452
Miss Robertson?

121
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:48,712
I liked it.

122
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,139
You liked it?

123
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:55,160
It was different. I thought it was very sad.

124
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:58,780
Sad? Why?

125
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:03,047
Because they were always driven away.

126
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:05,787
Because they were such outsiders.

127
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:08,381
Miss Robertson might be on to something.

128
00:19:09,494 --> 00:19:13,761
We all understand that a story has
to have a beginning, a middle, and an end.

129
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:19,887
But that's like saying a box has four sides.

130
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,908
Actually, Mr. Fallows, a box has six sides.

131
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:25,641
Busted!

132
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:03,783
You've actually talked to him?

133
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,450
-Yeah, he's nice.
-Real nice.

134
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:10,104
-I'm serious!
-I can see that!

135
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:13,017
Well, what happened?
Did he ask you out or anything?

136
00:20:13,617 --> 00:20:17,318
Nothing specific. Just a maybe.
We just talked at the theatre.

137
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:20,978
-That's all you would've done, anyway!
-What a waste!

138
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:23,765
Excuse me,
but what would you have done?

139
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:27,492
-Everything!
-"Everything!"

140
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:33,479
I may have plans of my own,
and they just might include Homeland.

141
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:37,839
I can just see you
in the back seat at Homeland!

142
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:42,512
Tanya, you gotta admit.
Your dad's gonna be there!

143
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,226
-I can just see it.
-My dad's not gonna be there!

144
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,800
Hi!

145
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,426
Charles? Hi!

146
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,574
Do you know Jeanette and Carrie?
This is Charles Brady.

147
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,680
-Hi!
-We are in the same class, Tanya.

148
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,547
Can I give you a ride home?
I mean all of you?

149
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:06,794
No, we've got a ride,
but why don't you go, Tanya?

150
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:11,208
See you later!

151
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,028
I also wanted to thank you.

152
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:23,355
For what?

153
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:25,495
For what you said in class.

154
00:21:26,742 --> 00:21:28,309
You really nailed it.

155
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:32,282
No, you did. So, thank you.

156
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:34,922
I think I know how they feel, the...

157
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:36,842
-What are they called?
-Sleepwalkers.

158
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:41,703
At least sometimes I feel that different.

159
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:53,304
-Madame.
-This yours?

160
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:55,703
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.

161
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,725
Some people use a door.

162
00:22:07,105 --> 00:22:08,038
-Really?
-Yes.

163
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:10,044
-I heard that somewhere.
-Did you?

164
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:21,965
Mom? Mom?

165
00:22:24,065 --> 00:22:25,766
She must be shopping or something.

166
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:27,518
Let's go upstairs.

167
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:35,406
-Thanks for the ride home.
-Any time.

168
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,607
These are interesting.

169
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:44,113
My mom does gravestone rubbings.
Pretty morbid, huh?

170
00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:47,373
No, I like them.

171
00:22:47,787 --> 00:22:48,954
-You do?
-Yeah.

172
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:56,127
My room.

173
00:22:57,547 --> 00:22:58,947
You have a lot of pictures.

174
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,087
Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.

175
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:05,055
These are great!

176
00:23:07,948 --> 00:23:09,048
Really nice.

177
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:11,375
Makes you want to...

178
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:12,828
What?

179
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:16,215
Just get a good look at these kind
of places.

180
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,709
The things that we never really see.

181
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:22,288
My favourite picture's over there.

182
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:25,308
Which one?

183
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:32,202
That one.

184
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,630
I like rocks.

185
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:36,383
You do?

186
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,990
I'd really like to see how you see
a photograph before you take it.

187
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,590
You don't even know me, but...

188
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,963
Actually, I was going to shoot
at Homeland tomorrow...

189
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,317
...if you want to come.

190
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:52,671
What's "Homeland"?

191
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:54,524
It's an old graveyard.

192
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,024
-Really?
-lt's neat.

193
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,637
I love old graveyards.

194
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:00,318
-Sweetheart...
-Mom!

195
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:03,144
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't know you had company.

196
00:24:04,471 --> 00:24:06,672
This is Charles Brady. This is my mom.

197
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,758
He gave me a ride home.

198
00:24:10,432 --> 00:24:11,532
That's nice.

199
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,725
-Charles.
-Very nice to meet you.

200
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:16,965
Likewise.

201
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:19,639
We should go.

202
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,992
We were just going.
So we'll do that tomorrow?

203
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:23,346
Yes!

204
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:27,126
I'll walk you out.

205
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:31,846
So, you two are going out tomorrow?

206
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:34,126
Yes.

207
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,206
Tanya's gonna show me...

208
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:39,287
...Homeland.

209
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:40,986
Oh, really?

210
00:24:41,594 --> 00:24:43,894
I do rubbings, too.
Not quite as fine as yours...

211
00:24:44,554 --> 00:24:47,554
...but I figure there must be
some old slate gravestones out there.

212
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:51,727
Yes. As a matter of fact,
in the old section near the woods.

213
00:24:53,514 --> 00:24:55,281
Tell me, do you use powder or stick?

214
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:57,741
I use stick! Usually a No. 5.

215
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:01,101
Really? Don't you find that a little hard?

216
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,301
Yeah, but I'm clumsy. You know,
powder's so messy and everything.

217
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:09,388
Tell me, Charles, where do you live?

218
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:11,095
66 Wicker Street.

219
00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:13,202
And your father? What does he do?

220
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,995
He's dead, Mrs. Robertson.

221
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,049
-I'm sorry.
-lt was a long time ago.

222
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:24,229
The Brands will be coming
to dinner tomorrow night.

223
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,302
Be back by 5:00, okay?

224
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:28,876
She will be.

225
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:39,177
-How'd you know all that stuff?
-I learned it a long time ago from my mom.

226
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:44,257
See you tomorrow.

227
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:42,201
Mr. Fallows! Hi!

228
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:44,328
Hello, Charles.

229
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,181
Checking out your new environment?

230
00:26:48,521 --> 00:26:52,521
Boring, isn't it? Disneyland for cows,
but for human beings?

231
00:26:54,921 --> 00:26:56,754
I like it. It's kind of peaceful.

232
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,349
Reminds you of Ohio, I suppose?

233
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:03,389
Yeah, well, you know.

234
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:07,715
No! Actually, I don't, Charles.
I don't know, and you don't either.

235
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:11,123
There is no Paradise Falls in Ohio.

236
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:14,376
Your transcripts are also fakes.

237
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:18,743
Clever fakes, but fakes. Anything to say?

238
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,490
-You're mistaken.
-Oh, no, I'm not.

239
00:27:22,043 --> 00:27:24,843
But you are, Charles,
if you think you can wiggle out of this.

240
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:29,037
I don't know who you are,
but I know you're not who you say you are.

241
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:33,724
If this is blackmail, Mr. Fallows,
I think you've picked the wrong guy.

242
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,277
This car is the only expensive thing
I've got. I'm sentimental about it.

243
00:27:37,964 --> 00:27:39,398
I don't think I can sell it.

244
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:41,604
Sit still till I'm through with you!

245
00:27:43,684 --> 00:27:45,551
Your generation is so mercenary.

246
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:48,037
Money this, money that...

247
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:52,058
Money isn't the only medium of exchange.

248
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:58,779
You're right. People really should learn
to keep their hands to themselves.

249
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:00,732
Here's yours.

250
00:28:21,926 --> 00:28:22,926
I'm sorry!

251
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,743
Come on, boy! Get the bad guy for daddy!

252
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,763
You know you want it! Get this bad guy!
Come on. Here you go!

253
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,677
Come on, boy!

254
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,157
Get the bad guy!

255
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:40,438
Here we go! Get that motherfucker!

256
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:43,738
Good boy, Clovis!

257
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:55,486
Looks like we found ourselves
a goddamned speedster!

258
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:11,420
Unit 3 calling home. You in there, Laurie?

259
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:13,647
Andy! Whatcha up to? Bye.

260
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:17,620
Got ourselves one lawless perpetrator
heading east on Gray Road. Copy?

261
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:20,480
Copy. Need any help? Bye.

262
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:23,680
I think I can handle this one all by myself.

263
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:27,400
What the...? Jesus!

264
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:12,137
Shit!

265
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:45,579
Jesus, no!

266
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:51,585
-ls everybody okay?
-Go get him!

267
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:56,366
-You son of a bitch!
-Report, Unit 3. Need a location.

268
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:00,799
I'm out on Pond Road, still in pursuit!
Bastard almost ran down a little girl!

269
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,333
I think he tried to run her down!
I think he's playing with me!

270
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:06,380
Get me some back up! Bye!

271
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:22,708
Pull over! Pull over, motherfucker!

272
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,768
Pull over!

273
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:36,869
What the fuck?

274
00:32:43,822 --> 00:32:45,889
What's going on out there, Andy?
Please respond!

275
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,522
Not now, Laurie.

276
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:56,396
Christ, Clovis! What's he got in there?
A supercharger?

277
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:01,627
I lost him.

278
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:05,126
How in the hell did I do that?

279
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,267
Stop looking at me.

280
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:15,387
Stop looking at me.

281
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:18,534
Stop looking at me, you fucking cat!

282
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:37,956
Shit, Clovis.

283
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,249
I know just how you feel.

284
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:19,418
Can I tell you something?

285
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,019
It's kind of weird, but...

286
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:26,466
Horace, if you laugh,
I'm gonna break your jaw!

287
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:31,546
What is it?

288
00:35:32,752 --> 00:35:35,919
I told you I couldn't see him because of
how fast we were going, right?

289
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:39,833
-That wasn't entirely true.
-How's that?

290
00:35:41,112 --> 00:35:43,179
We were both doing 90!
I pulled right up beside him!

291
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:46,846
-We might as well have been standing still!
-So you did get a good look at him.

292
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:50,327
No, no, I didn't! 'Cause see...

293
00:35:54,354 --> 00:35:55,954
...he didn't have no face.

294
00:35:57,794 --> 00:35:59,794
Andy, you got plenty of sick time coming.

295
00:36:01,674 --> 00:36:03,407
Horace! Shut your pie hole.

296
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:08,034
I mean, his face! It was like...

297
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:10,455
...a blur! Like...

298
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:14,214
Shit, I don't know!

299
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,575
Maybe you got some grit in your eye.
Makes them water.

300
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:26,815
I guess maybe that could have been it.

301
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,836
Andy? Do me a favour.
When you do get this stampeder...

302
00:36:32,596 --> 00:36:35,896
...leave that part out when you're talking
to the County Prosecutor, okay?

303
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,657
Anything else, Andy? Anything at all?

304
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:45,804
Yeah. There was something.

305
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:51,450
Clovis, here, got a good look at him
and he didn't like him.

306
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,177
He didn't like him one little bit!

307
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:58,237
And it was the other guy, too,
he didn't like Clovis!

308
00:36:58,797 --> 00:37:01,131
It was like he was scared of him.
Scared of a cat!

309
00:37:07,918 --> 00:37:10,052
I'm gonna look for this guy
on my way home...

310
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:13,078
...and I'm gonna find him.

311
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,258
I'm gonna find him.

312
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:48,901
-You didn't get it?
-No.

313
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
Why didn't you get anything?

314
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,927
I just couldn't.

315
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:55,061
What about the girl?

316
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:58,301
It wasn't the right time.
Tomorrow. I'll get it tomorrow.

317
00:38:01,721 --> 00:38:03,154
What are you talking about?

318
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:05,227
I'm starving, Charles!

319
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:08,242
I need it, and you have to get it for me!

320
00:38:19,962 --> 00:38:22,429
My poor baby! What happened?

321
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:24,682
What always happens, Mom.

322
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,469
Someone saw you?

323
00:38:27,802 --> 00:38:30,069
The deputy had a cat.
Maybe for a second or two.

324
00:38:31,403 --> 00:38:33,870
-He won't believe what he saw.
-No, he probably won't.

325
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:38,637
Somebody will find the teacher
that I dumped in the woods.

326
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:41,970
It's already started again, Mom!

327
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,103
Don't worry. Don't worry.

328
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,390
-But I have to feed you!
-You'll see her tomorrow.

329
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:50,357
What if something happens to me?
You'll starve!

330
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,964
We haven't even seen another sleepwalker.

331
00:38:55,604 --> 00:38:57,204
-We aren't the last.
-You don't know that!

332
00:38:57,645 --> 00:38:58,645
Yes, I do!

333
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:02,585
I can feel the others.

334
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,025
You'll feed tomorrow.

335
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:08,665
And then you will feed me,
and then we will leave.

336
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:10,892
Nothing's gonna happen.

337
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:19,699
We just have to take care of each other.

338
00:41:01,531 --> 00:41:04,898
Remember, I want you home by 5:00.
Make sure Charles understands that, okay?

339
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:09,359
Yes, Mommy, and I'll be sure
to pack extra didies, too!

340
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,692
Nobody loves a smart ass, Tanya.

341
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:15,939
She is smart, and I'm smart enough to
know it's her first date with the new boy.

342
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:20,039
We do understand each other, don't we?

343
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:22,567
You know, Mom, I think we do.

344
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:24,660
Good. 5:00?

345
00:41:25,493 --> 00:41:26,626
5:00.

346
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,994
-Bye, darlin'.
-Bye, Dad.

347
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:31,826
Have a good time, honey!

348
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:34,460
Are we awful?

349
00:41:34,974 --> 00:41:37,207
Terrible. God, I've become my mother.

350
00:41:38,654 --> 00:41:40,220
You met this kid. Is he okay?

351
00:41:40,814 --> 00:41:42,981
Yeah, he's terrific! He's utterly charming.

352
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,514
Does it have to be her?

353
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:52,861
-You care more for her than you do me.
-You know better than that.

354
00:41:56,094 --> 00:41:57,761
Why are you being such a bitch?

355
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:01,422
Because I'm hungry!

356
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:11,229
You cannot be in love with this girl.

357
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:20,236
I'll get it. You stay here.

358
00:42:25,296 --> 00:42:26,563
I love you, Mom.

359
00:42:28,056 --> 00:42:28,923
Do you?

360
00:42:39,978 --> 00:42:42,578
I know you were supposed to pick me up,
but I was nearby.

361
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:47,792
This is a bad time?

362
00:42:48,178 --> 00:42:50,311
Nonsense! I'm so glad you came by.

363
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:54,179
Thank you.

364
00:42:55,378 --> 00:42:57,645
We really ought to go.
The light for Tanya's pictures...

365
00:42:58,179 --> 00:42:59,779
Will be fine for hours yet.

366
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:02,973
Come in, Tanya. I have something for you.

367
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:04,459
You do?

368
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,067
I won't keep you long.
I know young people have to run and play.

369
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:19,920
Charles said you were nice,
and he was right. He usually is.

370
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,414
Thank you. Charles is very nice himself.

371
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,807
You have a very beautiful home.

372
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:31,808
These are beautiful figurines.

373
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:34,161
They've been in the family for a long time.

374
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:36,728
You probably wouldn't believe how long.

375
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:38,994
Mom, we really ought to be going.

376
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:41,675
Soon, Charles.

377
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:45,515
Just a second, dear.

378
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,229
This is beautiful.

379
00:43:56,862 --> 00:43:57,695
Nice car!

380
00:43:58,422 --> 00:44:00,389
-Where's the Trans Am?
-lt's in the shop.

381
00:44:01,623 --> 00:44:03,456
-The Mustang belongs to...
-His mother.

382
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:10,656
Those all your cats? There's a lot of them.

383
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:13,310
They're strays, but we'll get rid of them.

384
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,917
We're good at getting rid of pests.

385
00:44:26,024 --> 00:44:27,791
That finishes you, somehow.

386
00:44:28,864 --> 00:44:30,231
Thank you. That's very sweet.

387
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:32,657
"Sweets to the sweet," I always say.

388
00:44:34,224 --> 00:44:35,224
Right, Charles?

389
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,578
Go on now, you two, you'll lose the light.

390
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:44,492
Mrs. Brady, it was really nice to meet you.

391
00:44:45,345 --> 00:44:46,878
Very nice to meet you.

392
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:09,786
-This way.
-Thank you, ma'am.

393
00:45:21,107 --> 00:45:22,440
This is it.

394
00:45:43,268 --> 00:45:44,835
It's really beautiful here...

395
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:48,815
...and so are you.

396
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:51,549
Thank you, Charles.

397
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:57,043
I better get these out of the way right off.

398
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,703
Your mother's gonna want to know
some rubbing went on out here.

399
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:04,389
Me too, Charles.

400
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,923
Hey, wait up!

401
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:20,891
Charles?

402
00:46:34,152 --> 00:46:34,985
Hold it!

403
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:39,012
Come on.

404
00:47:00,793 --> 00:47:03,160
Hey, Clovis! What's up?
You catching a nap?

405
00:47:06,153 --> 00:47:08,020
"There comes Johnny
with his pecker in his hand

406
00:47:08,514 --> 00:47:10,714
"He's a one ball man
And he's off to the rodeo"

407
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:29,375
What are you looking at?

408
00:47:34,276 --> 00:47:35,442
Nice. Gotcha!

409
00:47:37,836 --> 00:47:39,269
Smile pretty.

410
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:42,556
Very nice!

411
00:47:44,076 --> 00:47:45,076
I'm sorry!

412
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:10,790
Sorry!

413
00:48:17,237 --> 00:48:18,404
No sorries.

414
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:40,025
Do you really feel alone
like the characters in your story?

415
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,253
'Cause I do.

416
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:45,472
I know.

417
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,153
It's wonderful to feel...

418
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,013
...like you're really with someone.

419
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,593
Together.

420
00:48:58,041 --> 00:48:59,774
Look, I think we better...

421
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,787
You don't know me, Tanya.

422
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,687
But I want to.

423
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:28,308
A little slower.

424
00:49:30,602 --> 00:49:32,735
I thought we understood each other.

425
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:57,463
I couldn't breathe!

426
00:49:57,763 --> 00:50:00,030
Isn't this the excitement
you were talking about?

427
00:50:07,724 --> 00:50:10,491
You're right!
We do understand each other.

428
00:50:14,805 --> 00:50:16,638
This is just how we live, Tanya!

429
00:50:24,005 --> 00:50:25,305
It doesn't have to hurt!

430
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:29,439
Don't you get it, Tanya? I need you.

431
00:50:30,685 --> 00:50:31,952
I need you to live!

432
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,380
Oh, God! Please don't kill me!

433
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:45,453
I don't think you're entering
into the spirit of this!

434
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,693
Why don't you just think
of yourself as lunch!

435
00:51:20,848 --> 00:51:21,949
Peek-a-baby!

436
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,549
I lied! It does have to hurt!

437
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:32,396
Feed me, Tanya! Mother's hungry!

438
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,817
Just look at this shirt!
My mother's gonna kill me!

439
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:52,237
Get off me! Get off!

440
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,744
Stay away from me!

441
00:51:57,571 --> 00:51:59,704
When exactly did I lose your trust?

442
00:52:03,611 --> 00:52:06,412
Help me! Somebody help me!

443
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,459
"Allemande left, allemande right

444
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,805
"Come on you fuckin' turkey
Get your right foot right

445
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:13,765
"Get off the stage, you fucking jerk

446
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:15,771
"You know you pissed me off"

447
00:52:20,852 --> 00:52:22,086
Hold the phone!

448
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:30,879
All right.

449
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:33,560
Help me! Please, somebody help!

450
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:38,354
Get me out of here! He's trying to kill me!
He's right behind me!

451
00:52:39,054 --> 00:52:40,820
-He's behind me!
-We'll get him!

452
00:52:41,293 --> 00:52:43,127
-You don't understand!
-One thing at a time.

453
00:52:43,613 --> 00:52:45,413
-This guy have a name?
-lt's Charles Brady!

454
00:52:45,893 --> 00:52:47,160
He's not human! His face changed!

455
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:49,434
His face changed? Get in the car! Lock it!

456
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:52,134
-We both have to go! Please?
-Just calm down!

457
00:52:52,693 --> 00:52:55,760
-No, wait! We both have to go!
-Calm down, okay?

458
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:58,541
Everything's gonna be all right.

459
00:53:04,735 --> 00:53:06,202
-Cop kabob!
-No!

460
00:53:11,175 --> 00:53:12,275
Isn't this fun?

461
00:53:35,096 --> 00:53:37,097
I don't believe you fired a warning shot.

462
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:56,091
Where were we, Tanya?

463
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,412
Oh, my God!

464
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:21,139
Unit 3, Unit 3. State your 20. Come on.

465
00:54:22,499 --> 00:54:24,699
Hello? Help me, please!
Somebody help me!

466
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,000
Andy, get with the program! Bye.

467
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,660
Oh, God! Hello?

468
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,080
Somebody help me, please?

469
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,487
I'm at the Homeland,
and the policeman is dead!

470
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,487
Please? Please come!

471
00:54:50,861 --> 00:54:52,528
Please! Please come!

472
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:54,045
Charles!

473
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:58,639
My face is so hot!

474
00:56:14,466 --> 00:56:15,799
I'm sorry, Mom, I tried.

475
00:56:16,186 --> 00:56:19,786
I really, really tried. It was the cat,
it was the kitty. You were right.

476
00:56:22,787 --> 00:56:24,420
We've only got each other.

477
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,807
That doesn't matter.

478
00:56:28,946 --> 00:56:30,347
Save your strength.

479
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:40,181
How bad is it?

480
00:56:40,587 --> 00:56:43,754
You'll be okay, honey,
but I'm afraid they'll be coming for us.

481
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:49,775
We can go, Mom. I'll be okay.

482
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:54,002
We've got to stay here
until you're stronger.

483
00:56:55,548 --> 00:56:57,282
But I want you to help me.

484
00:56:57,749 --> 00:56:59,616
Try to make yourself dim.

485
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:02,869
Will you do that for me, honey?

486
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:07,482
Go on, try.

487
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,550
I can't, Mom. I can't do it.

488
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,671
It's all right. I'll do it for both of us.

489
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:32,744
There's the car, and the traps! And the...

490
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:36,364
I'll take care of you.

491
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:45,825
Buddy? I ain't taking the rap on this.
I lock this place up every night.

492
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,139
It's not my fault if every pervert,
weirdo, horny kid...

493
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:51,798
Go talk to someone in charge. I'm busy!

494
00:58:00,113 --> 00:58:00,946
Buddy?

495
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:05,800
It's not my fault if every horny kid,
and weirdo pervert, comes in here.

496
00:58:06,513 --> 00:58:08,346
I lock this place up.
I don't need this action!

497
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:10,633
Don't talk to me, talk to the Sheriff.

498
00:58:19,873 --> 00:58:21,807
-Sheriff?
-Not now!

499
00:58:28,034 --> 00:58:30,667
His name is Charles Brady,
formerly of Paradise Falls...

500
00:58:31,355 --> 00:58:33,422
...now living at 66 Wicker Street.

501
00:58:34,675 --> 00:58:37,642
And the rest of it,
including the make and colour of the car?

502
00:58:39,835 --> 00:58:41,335
We came in a red car.

503
00:58:42,515 --> 00:58:43,815
And it was older.

504
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:47,855
But it wasn't the Trans Am.
See, he took me home in a Trans Am.

505
00:58:48,635 --> 00:58:50,002
It was a blue Trans Am.

506
00:58:50,515 --> 00:58:51,915
And he left here in one.

507
00:58:55,075 --> 00:58:57,342
Listen to me! I know I sound crazy!

508
00:58:59,595 --> 00:59:02,362
You're not getting the point!
Charles isn't human!

509
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:05,470
Excuse me, Miss.

510
00:59:05,996 --> 00:59:08,030
Sheriff, I need to document these bruises.

511
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:11,910
Do you have to do this now?

512
00:59:12,276 --> 00:59:15,076
It'll take a sec. Don't worry.
Could you just turn your head?

513
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:21,271
Thanks. And the other way, please?

514
00:59:24,077 --> 00:59:26,144
Oh, my God! My camera!
Did somebody find my camera?

515
00:59:26,677 --> 00:59:28,644
I took his picture in my camera!

516
00:59:30,597 --> 00:59:32,864
Yes! Develop that film!
You'll have his picture!

517
00:59:34,078 --> 00:59:35,811
Get on it, ASAP.

518
00:59:39,439 --> 00:59:42,406
This is Officer Raeburn.
He's gonna run you home.

519
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:47,092
I'll have to come over later tonight
and ask you a few more questions.

520
00:59:49,038 --> 00:59:52,139
-Are you sure his name was Charles Brady?
-That's what he said.

521
00:59:53,198 --> 00:59:55,932
-Do you think he was telling the truth?
-I don't know.

522
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,980
He was very charming.

523
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,447
Take her home.

524
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,373
Excuse me.

525
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:18,261
Sheriff?

526
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,714
Will you bring the cat
when you come this evening?

527
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:24,214
What for?

528
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,814
The cat saved my life.

529
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:30,202
Thank you.

530
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,429
Do her parents know a class one assault
did not occur?

531
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:39,395
You mean, do they know she managed
to avoid being raped by the bastard? Yes.

532
01:00:42,282 --> 01:00:43,082
Horace?

533
01:00:43,922 --> 01:00:46,556
-Don't let her out of your sight.
-Yapper.

534
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:05,757
Drink some of this nice cold water.
It'll make you feel better.

535
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:22,925
I'm dying, Mom.

536
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:24,445
No!

537
01:01:26,045 --> 01:01:29,612
My boy is not going to die! Not ever!

538
01:02:13,528 --> 01:02:16,394
They're coming!
I'm going to make us dim!

539
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,834
I can do it,
but you have to keep perfectly quiet!

540
01:02:23,008 --> 01:02:24,042
I love you.

541
01:02:28,169 --> 01:02:29,602
Quiet, Charles.

542
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:33,682
It'll be all right.

543
01:02:35,608 --> 01:02:36,708
I'm scared.

544
01:02:37,649 --> 01:02:41,082
Charles Brady? If you're in there, come out
with your hands open and empty!

545
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:43,589
I'm so scared, Mama.

546
01:02:45,649 --> 01:02:46,916
I have to do us.

547
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:51,963
Keep still.

548
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:56,723
Dim.

549
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:14,038
Open up, Brady!
I'm in no mood to be polite!

550
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:20,225
Police! Hands up!

551
01:03:21,892 --> 01:03:24,425
Ira? Soames.
There's nothing in the kitchen.

552
01:03:32,372 --> 01:03:34,039
I told you to wait on my word!

553
01:03:35,533 --> 01:03:37,066
I thought you gave it.

554
01:03:38,932 --> 01:03:41,233
-A lot of cats.
-I can see that, dickhead!

555
01:03:49,253 --> 01:03:51,953
Shit. What a Polish fire drill.

556
01:03:52,653 --> 01:03:54,920
Get out of there!
Get back in the damn car!

557
01:03:55,533 --> 01:03:56,500
Now, move!

558
01:03:57,213 --> 01:03:58,313
Move!

559
01:04:10,854 --> 01:04:11,654
What?

560
01:04:12,294 --> 01:04:13,694
Cold draft.

561
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:16,542
Use one right now, could you?

562
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,376
I'd like to set up a couple of checkpoints
in and out of town.

563
01:04:44,136 --> 01:04:46,070
The perp's history by now, Ira.

564
01:04:47,576 --> 01:04:49,276
He killed one of my men!

565
01:04:51,217 --> 01:04:54,584
All you got is one hysterical little girl
with a very vivid imagination.

566
01:04:55,777 --> 01:04:58,011
-What about the cats?
-What about them, Ira?

567
01:04:58,578 --> 01:05:00,744
That little girl needs a good smack
on the butt!

568
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,264
And if her mama and daddy won't do it...

569
01:05:04,178 --> 01:05:05,778
...l'll happily volunteer.

570
01:05:06,737 --> 01:05:08,471
Stay away from her, Soames!

571
01:05:15,418 --> 01:05:17,919
This is the best meal I've had
since my wife passed on.

572
01:05:19,139 --> 01:05:21,306
Boy, if Ira found out, he'd kill me.

573
01:05:22,058 --> 01:05:23,558
It was already made, Deputy.

574
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:26,493
There's one more ear of corn here.
Would you like it?

575
01:05:27,819 --> 01:05:28,852
Yes, ma'am.

576
01:05:40,499 --> 01:05:42,500
She's been up there an awfully long time.

577
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:45,627
She's taking a nice hot bath!

578
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:48,820
-She just needs to get clean!
-I know.

579
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:30,622
Honey? Is everything okay?

580
01:06:31,983 --> 01:06:33,316
Yeah, I'm just getting out.

581
01:06:33,703 --> 01:06:35,670
Your mother's keeping supper warm
for you.

582
01:06:37,182 --> 01:06:38,016
Honey?

583
01:06:42,184 --> 01:06:45,717
Thanks, Daddy. I just thought
I would lie down for a little while.

584
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,771
Could you call me when the Sheriff
gets here with the cat?

585
01:06:51,344 --> 01:06:52,377
Yeah, I will.

586
01:06:53,825 --> 01:06:55,025
I love you, honey.

587
01:06:56,944 --> 01:06:58,477
I love you too, Daddy.

588
01:07:13,305 --> 01:07:14,472
What was that?

589
01:07:28,426 --> 01:07:29,459
Who's there?

590
01:07:31,387 --> 01:07:34,020
Identify yourself! Police officers!

591
01:07:36,466 --> 01:07:38,000
Maybe it was the wind?

592
01:07:39,906 --> 01:07:41,707
It was not the fucking wind.

593
01:07:50,347 --> 01:07:52,481
You're right,
that was not the fucking wind.

594
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:01,255
-Who could that be?
-Let me take a peek.

595
01:08:14,909 --> 01:08:17,043
State Police. Probably Soames.

596
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:20,937
Hope he don't think he's gonna
question her before Ira gets here.

597
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:23,549
I'll get this.

598
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,130
Hi, I'm Mary Brady, Charles' mother.

599
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:32,817
Charles couldn't come.

600
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:34,323
Donald, who is it?

601
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:36,937
I'll take care of it! Just stay in the kitchen!

602
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:38,591
Mrs. Brady...

603
01:08:38,871 --> 01:08:40,904
I know he wanted you
to have these flowers.

604
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,578
Donald! Donald!

605
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:57,391
You have a lovely home, Mrs. Robertson.

606
01:08:59,391 --> 01:09:02,358
I've had lovely homes, too.
We never stay long, though.

607
01:09:04,312 --> 01:09:05,745
You stay away from them!

608
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:11,085
-lf you'd just call your daughter for me.
-What?

609
01:09:12,112 --> 01:09:14,079
My son is badly hurt. He may be dying.

610
01:09:14,912 --> 01:09:17,046
Your daughter tried to kill my Charles!

611
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:20,726
Good! I hope he dies!
I hope you both die!

612
01:09:21,473 --> 01:09:23,640
I hope you both die and rot in hell!

613
01:09:24,513 --> 01:09:26,680
He's my son! My only son!

614
01:09:31,673 --> 01:09:32,506
Daddy?

615
01:09:34,433 --> 01:09:35,233
Mom?

616
01:09:52,315 --> 01:09:54,015
Oh, my God! Daddy?

617
01:09:58,035 --> 01:10:00,002
Get off me! What have you done?

618
01:10:05,636 --> 01:10:08,069
-This is how they came out of the camera?
-That's it.

619
01:10:10,156 --> 01:10:11,956
So, was the camera moving, or...

620
01:10:12,436 --> 01:10:15,136
No. The background and the clothes are
in focus.

621
01:10:16,396 --> 01:10:19,363
-Laurie, would you get that damn thing?
-Take a look at the collar.

622
01:10:21,356 --> 01:10:22,590
Travis Sheriff's Department.

623
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:24,416
-Where's Ira?
-What's going on there?

624
01:10:24,836 --> 01:10:26,970
There's a woman here!
She says she's Charles' mother.

625
01:10:27,517 --> 01:10:28,917
I think she killed Don Robertson!

626
01:10:29,317 --> 01:10:31,451
-Slow down, Horace.
-There's blood everywhere!

627
01:10:37,877 --> 01:10:39,644
No vegetables, no dessert.

628
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:43,184
Those are the rules.

629
01:10:44,797 --> 01:10:46,631
What's going on here? Hello, Horace?

630
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:49,898
Come on, Horace! Answer the phone!

631
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:51,712
Are you there?

632
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:56,279
Answer the damn phone!

633
01:11:44,521 --> 01:11:46,288
Get that woman over there to safety.

634
01:11:47,322 --> 01:11:49,555
Hold it! Right there! Put her down!

635
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:55,009
-Put the girl down.
-Give me back my daughter!

636
01:11:55,802 --> 01:11:56,969
Put her down!

637
01:12:09,203 --> 01:12:12,170
Get Soames, every man he has!
Castle Rock, too!

638
01:12:32,684 --> 01:12:34,218
Drop the gun, lady!

639
01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:02,632
Hello, dear.

640
01:13:04,885 --> 01:13:06,552
What's happening?
Where are you taking me?

641
01:13:07,006 --> 01:13:08,473
To see Charles, dear.

642
01:13:18,767 --> 01:13:20,334
Get in here, you bitch!

643
01:13:56,649 --> 01:13:57,683
Oh, my God!

644
01:14:31,251 --> 01:14:33,818
Charles! My beautiful Charles!
Mommy's home!

645
01:14:39,172 --> 01:14:41,039
See what Mommy's brought you?

646
01:14:44,732 --> 01:14:45,765
He's dead!

647
01:14:46,973 --> 01:14:48,439
Look at him, he's dead!

648
01:14:48,972 --> 01:14:50,906
No! He's not dead!

649
01:14:54,933 --> 01:14:56,099
He's sleeping.

650
01:14:56,812 --> 01:14:58,646
Can't you see he's sleeping?

651
01:15:01,493 --> 01:15:03,326
You know what I bet he'd love to do?

652
01:15:05,893 --> 01:15:07,593
You'd like to dance...

653
01:15:09,414 --> 01:15:11,080
...wouldn't you, my darling?

654
01:15:41,455 --> 01:15:44,422
That's his favourite song.
Did you know that?

655
01:15:47,616 --> 01:15:49,316
I said, did you know that?

656
01:15:52,936 --> 01:15:54,803
Yes. He's a wonderful dancer.

657
01:15:56,456 --> 01:15:59,490
But you don't have to take my word for it!
You can see for yourself!

658
01:16:00,816 --> 01:16:01,650
What?

659
01:16:03,177 --> 01:16:04,344
Dance with him.

660
01:16:05,057 --> 01:16:07,024
-Dance with...?
-With Charles.

661
01:16:07,537 --> 01:16:09,404
Dance with my son.

662
01:16:24,298 --> 01:16:25,131
Relax!

663
01:16:29,178 --> 01:16:30,778
He's a wonderful dancer.

664
01:16:33,459 --> 01:16:34,492
He'll lead.

665
01:16:44,659 --> 01:16:47,626
There! That's it! Dance!

666
01:17:08,261 --> 01:17:09,128
Clovis?

667
01:17:31,582 --> 01:17:33,016
Yes! Now, Charles, now!

668
01:17:45,423 --> 01:17:47,423
Good, Charles!

669
01:17:48,703 --> 01:17:50,903
Feed. Suck her dry!

670
01:17:56,024 --> 01:17:58,691
-Stop! You're killing him!
-Die!

671
01:18:13,104 --> 01:18:14,905
Tanya! Get out of there!

672
01:18:29,105 --> 01:18:29,805
Go!

673
01:18:50,547 --> 01:18:51,513
Holy shit!

674
01:18:57,587 --> 01:18:59,420
We've got to go!

675
01:19:01,228 --> 01:19:02,394
-Come on!
-Wait!

676
01:19:03,148 --> 01:19:04,981
Charles was dead, wasn't he?

677
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:07,654
He was dead! Yes! Let's go!

678
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:39,870
Hey, Mom!

679
01:19:59,991 --> 01:20:01,025
Sheriff!

680
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:10,562
You killed my son! My only son!

681
01:21:50,157 --> 01:21:53,158
It's just you and me, Clovis.
Just you and me.
