1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,023
I

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,149
What are you doing?

3
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,451
Not up here.
Get back down there.

4
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,613
Jesus. Morons.

5
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,825
Hey, do you think
you could speed it up?

6
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,661
I got another load of sheets
coming from county hospital...

7
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,996
in one hour.

8
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,398
You! I'm talking to you!

9
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,167
You, come on!

10
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,795
Jesus.

11
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,804
Hey, move it! Move it!

12
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,640
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,949
Good morning,
Mrs. Frawley.

14
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,017
Good morning, dear.

15
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,854
You're looking good
today, Sherry.

16
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,254
Hi.

17
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,427
Good morning.

18
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,464
Good morning.

19
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,267
You ought to watch
yourself, dear.

20
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,202
Let me help you
with that.

21
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,804
Take care
of number one.

22
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,806
Don't let the
pressure get to you.

23
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,809
What do you think
about the new girl?

24
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,577
Lin Sue?

25
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,146
Oh, she's OK.

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,647
If you're
not careful...

27
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,149
you'll end up
like me.

28
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
I'll keep that
in mind.

29
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,020
I wonder where
the boss found her.

30
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,956
I wish she'd go back to whatever
sewer she crawled out of.

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,462
Let's get that
second boiler working.

32
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,967
Do you understand me?

33
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,974
Watch that pressure gauge!

34
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,952
What are you doing?

35
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,954
I'm fixing the boiler!

36
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,455
Coming through!
Coming through!

37
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,958
Back off now.
We're coming through.

38
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,459
Steady now.
Steady now.

39
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,961
You better tighten
the belts.

40
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:15,962
What?

41
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,830
The belts--tighten
them with clamps...

42
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,594
so we can get
a bigger load in.

43
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,738
Now, steady.

44
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,140
Come on.
We're way behind.

45
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,608
Ow!

46
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,313
What are you doing?

47
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,881
Watch out!

48
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,016
- Aah!
- Aah!

49
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,518
Aah!

50
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,686
Stanner!

51
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,787
Sherry!

52
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:41,988
Stanner!

53
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,190
Sir! Yes, sir!

54
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,358
Ow!

55
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,362
Holy shit,
what was that about?

56
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,464
Goddamn sons of bitches.

57
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,300
These two idiots
almost killed Sherry.

58
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,635
Damn it!

59
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,136
Jeez, I'm sorry.
Are you OK?

60
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,705
Moron! You could have
killed her!

61
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,673
It's nothing. I'm OK.

62
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,909
Sherry.

63
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,410
You may need stitches.

64
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,079
No. I'm OK now.

65
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,414
Mr. Gartley, sir.

66
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,916
Do something.

67
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,918
Get 'em back to work!

68
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,854
Work 'em like
there's no tomorrow.

69
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,191
You boys with that
piece-of-shit icebox...

70
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,426
get it out of here! Move!

71
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,662
Deliver on time,
or you'll lose our business.

72
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,631
Move it!

73
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,936
Stanner, time's a-wasting.

74
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,438
Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick.

75
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,440
Ha ha ha!

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,442
It's all right,
George.

77
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,445
You know,
life's a bitch...

78
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,947
then you die.

79
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,949
Get 'em back to work.

80
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,017
Yes, sir.

81
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,418
We're behind schedule
as it is, goddamn it.

82
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,452
Yes, s--

83
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,954
I got deadlines,
George.

84
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,456
Never enough time
around here--never.

85
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,125
You heard the man!

86
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,627
Let's go! Move it!
Don't look at me!

87
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,130
You, get back to work.

88
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,965
Come on, get back to work.

89
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,800
Get back to work.

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,599
Come on,
work with me, ladies.

91
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,017
I

92
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,924
Good morning.

93
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,425
Good morning,
officer.

94
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,327
- How are you?
- Have a nice day.

95
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,134
Shit...shit...shit.

96
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,330
Got the address?

97
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,841
It's 1216 Lake...

98
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,834
or is it 1218?

99
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:40,466
It's over there.

100
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,534
Oh, fuck!

101
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,662
What did I miss?

102
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:51,411
Shit!

103
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,879
Hey!

104
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,682
Idiot, what was that?

105
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,184
Hey, what was that?

106
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,053
Hey, idiot,
I'm talking to you.

107
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,455
Hey! Hey! Hey!

108
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,157
No, I'm talking
to the other idiot.

109
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,092
What was that? What?
Can't you drive?

110
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,627
Move the truck.

111
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,095
Sir, we're just
delivering an icebox.

112
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,129
I don't give a fuck...

113
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,397
if you're delivering
a pizza to the Pope.

114
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,432
Move the fucking truck.

115
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,066
You looking
for trouble, asshole?

116
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,470
That's Officer Asshole
to you.

117
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,471
Move the truck...

118
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,506
and then we'll
talk, OK?

119
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,372
OK.

120
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:37,021
Sorry about
your hand, Sherry.

121
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,962
Boss, you're not kidding.
This icebox is hot.

122
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,965
All right, Mr. Gates,
it's time to talk.

123
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,468
It seems that your driver's
license has expired.

124
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,036
Watch out!

125
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,238
Shit! Uh!

126
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,305
Oh, I'm really
sorry, officer.

127
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:27,473
Jesus!

128
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,443
Get this goddamn thing
off of me!

129
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,280
Shit!

130
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,717
Numb nuts! Jesus!

131
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,868
Ow!

132
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,150
Are you OK?

133
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,020
Frawley! There's no time
for daydreaming.

134
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,422
I've got another load
coming in.

135
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,618
Now, both of you,
back to work!

136
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,383
Ow!

137
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,696
Bring the ratchet.

138
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,238
Oh!

139
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,082
Oh!

140
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,454
Aah!

141
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,289
Oh, God!

142
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,259
Aah! Oh, God! Help me!

143
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,127
Oh, God!

144
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,229
Help me, please!

145
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,397
My God!

146
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,932
Please, help!

147
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:03,102
No!

148
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:07,704
Aah!

149
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,943
Hell's bells, Adelle!

150
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,312
Shut it off! Aah!

151
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,814
I don't know how!

152
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,249
Aah!

153
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,285
It won't shut off!

154
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,886
Aah!

155
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,455
Shut it off!

156
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,556
Aah!

157
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,024
It won't shut off!

158
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,959
No!

159
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,528
Aah!

160
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,231
Goddamn!

161
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,134
Uh! Uh!

162
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,702
Get back!
Get back!

163
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,204
Mrs. Frawley!
Oh, my God!

164
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,705
Jesus! Oh, God!

165
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,973
Aah!

166
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,498
Out of my way!

167
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,649
Oh!

168
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,744
Oh! Oh! Oh!

169
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,495
Oh, Frawley!

170
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,498
You stupid old bitch!

171
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,000
Always getting in the way.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,198
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!

173
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,838
Now, what's that for?

174
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,839
Reckless driving...

175
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,007
illegal parking...

176
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,842
blocking of
a public street.

177
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,844
Come on, pal.
Give me a break.

178
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,346
What do you want?

179
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,881
Insulting an officer...

180
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,517
or being an arrogant,
ignorant son of a bitch?

181
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,018
Since when
is that a crime?

182
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,520
Help me, boss!

183
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,522
Aw, you broke
my damn watch.

184
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,023
I'm all pooped out.

185
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,525
Officer Hunton, come in.

186
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,527
Damn it.
You're a moron.

187
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,326
Officer Hunton,
come in.

188
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,866
Officer Hunton.

189
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,835
Yeah, yeah.

190
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,037
Yeah, Molly,
what have you got?

191
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,540
Good morning, Johnny.
How's your day so far?

192
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,042
Oh, my day's peachy,
Molly. What's up?

193
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,545
We've got a death
at the Blue Ribbon Laundry.

194
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,113
It's a bad one.

195
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,550
Sheriff Hughes got called away
to an urgent meeting.

196
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,519
I need some help.

197
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:05,491
What's going on, and how many
did you take this time?

198
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,461
Right side up. Come on.

199
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,454
All right, Molly, I'm on
the way. Thanks a lot.

200
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:44,964
Oh, my God!

201
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:50,194
No!

202
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,973
Sherry, it's OK.

203
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,474
Get away from me!

204
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,909
Her worries are over.

205
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,343
Get away from me!

206
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,227
Holy shit.

207
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,580
Hello.

208
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,117
Is Mr. Gartley here?

209
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,619
Mr. Gartley
is unavailable.

210
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,123
I'm Stanner.
I'm the foreman.

211
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,158
Mr. Stanner...

212
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,627
I'm, uh--
I'm Officer Hunton.

213
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,629
Can you show me...

214
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,598
what happened,
Mr. Stanner?

215
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,634
Do I have to?

216
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,237
Yeah, you have to.

217
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:01,540
She's down there.
I--I can't look at it again.

218
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,042
It makes me sick.

219
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:07,546
She's down there. I can't.
I'm sorry. I can't look at it.

220
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,515
Yeah, right,
you can't look.

221
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,424
Run a loose shop,
cut corners--

222
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,059
what do you expect?

223
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,561
People get hurt
or killed, right?

224
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,563
And then he can't look.

225
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,532
No, he can't look at it.

226
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,569
Oh.

227
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,405
Hell of a mess,
huh, Johnny?

228
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,574
You know,
me and my old camera...

229
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,575
were doing this...

230
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,011
long before you even
came to this town.

231
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,537
Never did
get used to it.

232
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,550
Yeah, right.

233
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:50,089
Oh.

234
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,092
Um...pictureman...

235
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:57,029
make sure I get
some copies of that.

236
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,931
Like always.

237
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,264
Have I ever
let you down?

238
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,628
Yes.

239
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:24,715
Oh...shit.

240
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,860
I feel like
it's all my fault.

241
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,361
I just wasn't
strong enough.

242
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,863
I tried to help her.

243
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,864
I tried to pull
her free.

244
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:32,932
OK, it's all right.
It's all right.

245
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,127
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

246
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,026
It's OK.

247
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,308
Ex--excuse me.

248
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,913
I know how you feel.

249
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,883
Have you seen
that machine?

250
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,352
It makes me
sick to my stomach.

251
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,891
These will help.

252
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,827
Mrs. Frawley
used to take 'em.

253
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,462
Oh, keep the bottle.

254
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,841
Thank you.

255
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,208
Annette Gillian.

256
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,782
Uh, John Hunton.
How do you do?

257
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,841
Hi.

258
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:30,481
Oh, poor Mrs. Frawley.
Oh, God!

259
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,276
Hey, what's going on?

260
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,277
Nothing, Johnny.

261
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,880
We're here to settle
a safety issue.

262
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,382
What's the emergency,
anyway?

263
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,883
There's been
a slight accident...

264
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,451
with a speed ironer.

265
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,851
Let's go in.

266
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,953
If the safety features
on this machine...

267
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,622
meet state
and local standards...

268
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,657
then you may resume
operation.

269
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,160
Yes, thank you,
Judge Bishop.

270
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,796
OK, Martin,
start her up.

271
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,628
Stand clear, boys.

272
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,306
Let's start
with the safety bar.

273
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,308
When I lift this up...

274
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,300
the machine
should stop. Uhh!

275
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,981
Put it down,
it should start.

276
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,284
What is your conclusion,
Mr. Martin?

277
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,286
Well, I'll tell you,
Judge Bishop...

278
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,288
the safety bar seems to
be working fine.

279
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,322
Then I declare...

280
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,791
that this was a case
of accidental death.

281
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,293
This inquest is closed.

282
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,295
I know what you
think of my work.

283
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,697
Look, there's no such thing as
empirical truth...

284
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,466
in theoretical
parapsychology.

285
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,801
If you saw seraphims
and cherubims...

286
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,137
falling out of the sky,
singing HallElujah...

287
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,638
you wouldn't believe it.

288
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,173
You want proof,
right?

289
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,938
Oh, you'll
never change.

290
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,519
You haven't
eaten much.

291
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,322
What? You're not
feeling well?

292
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,924
There was
an accident today--

293
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,127
the worst one
I've ever seen.

294
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,151
Messy?

295
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,006
So how long
is it now...

296
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,275
you've been chasing
corpses?

297
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,943
14 years.

298
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,612
Oh, man, 14 years.

299
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,148
You know,
you need to spend...

300
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,750
some more time
with the living.

301
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,252
Ha ha ha!

302
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,518
Jesus, you sound
just like Sandy.

303
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,425
Sandra
really loved you.

304
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,994
Whatever.

305
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,264
Uh, I just--I just
got to hang in there...

306
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,267
and get my 20 years in
so I can retire...

307
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,270
and get the fuck
out of this town...

308
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,272
before I turn
completely numb.

309
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,874
Yeah, well, uh,
you know, Johnny...

310
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,434
you really do
need to get a life.

311
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,249
I got a life.

312
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,389
What I need
is a beer.

313
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,357
Come over if you want.

314
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,458
I don't suppose...

315
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,860
you know anything about
industrial laundries?

316
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,362
You know, I used to work in an
industrial laundry...

317
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,364
when I was an
undergraduate at Berkeley.

318
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,866
Get out of here.

319
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,367
I did, man.

320
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,368
Really?

321
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,369
Yeah, sure.

322
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,306
Well, look, do you know
that machine...

323
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,374
they call
the speed ironer?

324
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,877
Oh, man, yeah.
It's called a mangle.

325
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,378
A mangler?

326
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,880
Mangle.

327
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,349
That's the one.
That's the one.

328
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,353
It mangled a woman
this morning...

329
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,387
Oh!

330
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,891
Over at Mr. Gartley's
Blue Ribbon Laundry.

331
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,359
It...

332
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,896
There was hardly
anything left of her.

333
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,898
No way. No way, man.
That can't happen.

334
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,900
You've got
a safety bar.

335
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,902
If someone's feeding
the machine...

336
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,904
and get their hand
underneath...

337
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,105
the bar snaps up...

338
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,406
and turns the damn
thing off.

339
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,407
Right.

340
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,508
Well, that's
how I remember it.

341
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,344
Yeah, it's got
a safety bar...

342
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,312
but it happened anyhow.

343
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:52,717
Oh, God. Man,
what a way to go.

344
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,911
I hated
that machine.

345
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,571
Oh, fuck me!
I can't do this!

346
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,640
Well, it is
what it is, right?

347
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,908
Johnny, don't.
I mean, you can't--

348
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,037
What? A woman's dead, Mark.

349
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,049
It folded her like a sheet.

350
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:29,221
They carried her out
in a basket.

351
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,025
Whose ass
is on the line?

352
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,093
Nobody's ass
is on the line.

353
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,595
Gartley owns Judge Bishop.

354
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,597
Judge Bishop
owns the sheriff.

355
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,599
I mean, it's all dirty.
It's all dirty.

356
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,534
Yeah, but why are you
fighting it, man?

357
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,102
I mean, wake up.

358
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,505
I've been in this town
long enough to know...

359
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,273
that there's some
strange shit going on.

360
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,775
It's always been
narrow-minded...

361
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,109
and corrupt.

362
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,744
Hell, they used to
burn witches...

363
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,945
just 10 miles from here.

364
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,015
This puritanical ethic
is still hanging over--

365
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,018
Look, don't start
with the sprout-breath...

366
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,287
political mystical
bullshit, Mark.

367
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,257
I'm not in the mood
this evening. Thank you.

368
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,794
The woman's dead...

369
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:12,264
and that machine
is running right now...

370
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,801
all right, like nothing
happened--business as usual--

371
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,303
6 miles from here--

372
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,805
6 miles.

373
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,306
Oh, whatever.

374
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,808
Now, what the hell
are you...

375
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:23,809
supposed to do
about it, huh?

376
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:24,810
Have a beer.
That's what I'll do.

377
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,911
You're what?

378
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,012
You're gonna take
the sins of the world...

379
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,814
on your shoulders?
It's your fault?

380
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,816
I mean, you have to
live a little.

381
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,818
You can't just
take everything in.

382
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,919
Yeah, you're right.

383
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,354
Come on.
Just live a little.

384
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,555
You're my brother-in-law,
I love you, man.

385
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,723
You're going to get a
goddamn nervous breakdown.

386
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,790
Alright.

387
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,292
I'm worried
about you.

388
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,294
You want some yogurt?
I got some yogurt.

389
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,795
Is it whole-wheat?

390
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,297
Granola? I got granola.

391
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,798
Yeah, is it organic?

392
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:47,766
No.

393
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:48,556
I

394
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,306
Are you OK?

395
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,775
I wish I could
go home.

396
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,986
- Aah!
- Aah!

397
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,955
Aah!

398
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:17,896
Aah!

399
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,498
Move away!

400
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,266
Move away from there!

401
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,168
Do something!

402
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,337
- Aah!
- Aah!

403
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:29,141
Shut that damn thing off!

404
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,734
Inside.

405
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,146
Help!

406
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,270
I'm sorry.

407
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,703
Chaos abounds,
my dear.

408
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:10,248
You'd better
get used to it.

409
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,251
Like I told you,
there's no free lunch...

410
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,755
no sirree, Bob, not in
this lifetime. Uh-uh.

411
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,757
Ha ha!

412
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:24,663
Still, life must be better here
than on the streets, hmm?

413
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,731
Here, the predators
are few.

414
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,530
The benefits are many, hmm?

415
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,737
Hmm? Mmm.

416
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,196
For I am a generous man.

417
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:42,043
I...am a man
of my word.

418
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,720
Now, then...

419
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,262
why don't you
go in there...

420
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,232
and freshen up for
your Uncle Billy?

421
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,704
Go on now. Draw
your bath. Skedaddle.

422
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,205
OK.

423
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,707
Shoo.

424
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,835
Shoo. Shoo fly.

425
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:40,497
Would you like to come in here
and keep me company?

426
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,862
Uh!

427
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,818
Lin Sue, Lin Sue...

428
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,254
you sweet...

429
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,023
young woman.

430
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,759
I'll tell you...

431
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,890
the one thing worse
than the devil within...

432
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,296
is the devil
without.

433
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:57,782
Save my seat.

434
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,250
Hello.

435
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,554
Yeah.

436
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,523
What?

437
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,228
What? What is it?

438
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,230
There's been another
accident at the laundry.

439
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,733
A steam hose broke loose
on that machine...

440
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,234
burned three women.

441
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,669
One of them
is at the hospital.

442
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,737
Shit.

443
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,831
Hey, can I come with?

444
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,753
Hey, Pascal...

445
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,755
how you liking
public service?

446
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,256
Oh, you know.

447
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,258
Can you tell me
what room...

448
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,760
Annette Gillian
is in, please?

449
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,261
Room 132.

450
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,729
Thank you.

451
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,234
Annette!
Annette!

452
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,236
Remember me?
I'm Officer Hunton.

453
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,238
Oh, I thought
you were the doctor.

454
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,040
Well, go get
a goddamn doctor!

455
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,575
Wh-where is he?

456
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:00,245
Where's the doctor?

457
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,681
Oh, God!

458
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,683
What took you
so long?

459
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,184
That's it. Take it
easy, Annette.

460
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,752
Take it easy.

461
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:11,356
Annette, Annette,
take it easy.

462
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,121
This is going to take
the pain away, huh?

463
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,030
No pain allowed
in this hospital.

464
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,498
There we go.

465
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,334
There.

466
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,976
That's it.

467
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,714
Ooh.

468
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,482
What do you want?

469
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,717
- Ooh.
- I'm Officer Hunton.

470
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,719
I'm here to ask Annette
about the accident.

471
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,854
I don't think
she's up to it.

472
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,656
I don't think I want
a second opinion.

473
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,459
Annette, what happened?

474
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,762
We was running sheets...

475
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,765
and the ironer
just blew up.

476
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,267
Mr. Stanner said
there must have been...

477
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:59,270
a surge from the boiler
or something.

478
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,905
I don't know.

479
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:04,501
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

480
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,646
It all started
happening when Sherry...

481
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,549
cut her hand on
one of the clamps.

482
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,051
On the mangler?

483
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,052
Yeah.

484
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,553
Was there blood?

485
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,556
Well, I mean, did she
bleed on the mangler?

486
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,158
There was blood
everywhere...

487
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,394
and then later...

488
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,230
Mrs. Frawley...

489
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,733
I think she's had enough.
She needs some rest.

490
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,668
Annette,
thank you very much.

491
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:37,876
Sherry Ouelette--
Mr. Gartley's niece...

492
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,212
just out of
high school.

493
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:44,716
Mr. Gartley watches
her like a hawk--

494
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,718
has all her life.

495
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:49,888
Won't let her have
any boyfriends...

496
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,687
or go on dates.

497
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,730
You know, it's almost
like that machine...

498
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:03,134
had tasted blood
and found it liked it.

499
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,940
Don't women get funny
ideas sometimes?

500
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,576
Thank you very much,
Annette.

501
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,479
You'll be fine.
Bye-bye. Thanks.

502
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,514
Come on.

503
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,082
Annette, I just
wanted to ask--

504
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,584
Mark...

505
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,052
come.

506
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,295
Safety inspector
barely had time...

507
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,396
to check the machine.

508
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,998
They railroaded that
inquest through.

509
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,300
Said, "Everything's OK.

510
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,634
Put those kids
back to work."

511
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:40,438
And then, kapoom--
three women burned...

512
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,140
one kid's disfigured
for life.

513
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,710
Now, that's against
the law in my book.

514
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,113
So, what do you
think? Mark?

515
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,215
What?

516
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,216
What's going on...

517
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,884
in that jelly-roll
head of yours?

518
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,253
Nothing.

519
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,555
Right. That would
be a first.

520
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:02,218
Barry!

521
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,235
Was that
Mrs. Ellenshaw?

522
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,828
Yeah.

523
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,907
Take it easy, man.

524
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,240
Right. You, too.

525
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,818
Hey, man...

526
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,221
why don't you
come on over?

527
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,723
There's something
important...

528
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,258
I want to show you.

529
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,726
Six-pack of beer?

530
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,761
No. Come on.
Are you hungry?

531
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,062
No. I'm going
to bed.

532
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,691
No, come on. It's really
important. Come on.

533
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,568
Ah, what the fuck.

534
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,604
Cold beer, huh? Is that
all I'm good for?

535
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,273
You really know
how to hurt a guy.

536
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,774
That's no way to treat
your brother-in-law...

537
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:50,808
but I suppose
you'd follow me...

538
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,277
to the ends of the earth
if I asked.

539
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,478
That's right, man.

540
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:58,549
I'd follow you to the ends
of the earth, man.

541
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,684
Come.

542
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,286
Where?

543
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,221
Frazer's GoldEn Bough--

544
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,757
check it out. You
might learn something.

545
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,558
"Frazer's GoldEn Bough--

546
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,627
"The definitive work
on magic...

547
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,062
and the occult."

548
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,826
Check it out.
Check it out.

549
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,968
Have you considered
the possibility...

550
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,130
that the machine
may be haunted?

551
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,575
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yes, Mark. Yes.

552
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,911
That's the first thing
that popped into my mind.

553
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,680
No. Play along with me.

554
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,715
Maybe "haunted"
is not a good word.

555
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,207
Let's say "possessed."

556
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,586
Possessed?

557
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:38,856
Yeah. Yeah, man.
Possessed.

558
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,391
Possessed?

559
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,627
Yeah! Possessed.

560
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,762
By the parrot demon,
right?

561
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,230
OK, OK.

562
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,032
I'll tell you what
we're going to do, Mark.

563
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,667
We're going to grab
that bad boy by the throat...

564
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,336
shove a couple cloves
of garlic up his butt...

565
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,870
and that will be
the end of it, right?

566
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,505
- [Chuckles]
- Man, this stuff is for real.

567
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:55,974
I'm serious about this.

568
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,208
I mean, check it out.
This stuff is for real.

569
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,677
Look, if you just
look in here...

570
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,612
I mean, everything
is pointing--

571
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:05,850
Mark...check it out.

572
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,518
First there is God...

573
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,555
then there's country,
and then there's the law.

574
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,490
All right?

575
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,859
The rest is bullshit.

576
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,350
OK?

577
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,031
This is bullshit, Mark.

578
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:24,869
Reality, bullshit.
Bullshit, reality.

579
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,303
This is bullshit.

580
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,965
Aah! Help!

581
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,435
Whoa! I got you.
I got you.

582
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,171
Aah!

583
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,907
It's OK.
It's OK. Shh.

584
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,308
It's all right.
It's all right.

585
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,810
You'll be OK.
You'll be OK.

586
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,112
Bring her up here, George.

587
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:44,615
But, Mr. Gartley,
she's hurt, sir.

588
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,818
Mr. Gartley,
she needs a doctor.

589
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,019
She needs help.

590
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,954
My finger!

591
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,990
Bring her to me.

592
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,826
All spells
can be reduced...

593
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,395
to simple
common denominators.

594
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,396
European spells...

595
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,564
mention the hand
of glory...

596
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,065
and that's
real trouble.

597
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,567
Look, spells need
a catalyst--

598
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,202
either herbal
or human or both.

599
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,970
The answer
is in that book.

600
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,505
Just go for it!

601
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,340
- Uh-huh.
- Carry on. Come on. Come on.

602
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,042
Read on, man.

603
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:15,146
Uhh, belladonna,
hand of glory...

604
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,581
blood of a virgin!

605
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,582
Ha ha ha!

606
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,783
Now, that's supernatural.

607
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:22,353
Supernatural is a really
misleading word, man.

608
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,690
Witches, demons,
spirits--

609
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,694
all part of nature.
Like, um...OK, well...

610
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,363
a demon is a kind of energy like
electricity...

611
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,365
or fire.

612
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,868
Sometimes it gets
out of control...

613
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,804
and people get hurt.

614
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,140
Thought you might
want something to eat.

615
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,075
Thank you.

616
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,643
The most powerful spells...

617
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,612
always incorporate
belladonna.

618
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,147
What is
belladonna?

619
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,748
The hand of glory,
or deadly nightshade.

620
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:51,749
The plant?

621
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:55,520
Yeah. And the most
common ingredient...

622
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,421
in all these spells...

623
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,084
is, uh, the blood
of a virgin.

624
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,397
You must admit...

625
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,432
the way Annette
describes Sherry...

626
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:12,136
she sounds the type.

627
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,938
Oh, come on.

628
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,573
Come on.
Go with the flow.

629
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,208
Think of
the possibilities.

630
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,010
- Could be fun, huh?
- Yeah, uh.

631
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,611
All right.

632
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,613
Hey, Mark,
tell you what.

633
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,081
I'll run
right on over...

634
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,083
to Sherry Ouelette's
house, OK?

635
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,618
Knock on the door.

636
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,086
"Sherry? Hi.

637
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,455
"My name is
Officer John Hunton.

638
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,057
"I'm with the police
department here...

639
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,559
"and I am
investigating...

640
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,060
"a laundry machine...

641
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,262
"with a bad case
of demon possession...

642
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,697
"and I need
to examine you...

643
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,698
"to determine...

644
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,360
whether or not
you're a virgin."

645
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,201
Right?

646
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,372
Mmm...mm-hmm.

647
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,075
Huh?

648
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,944
Mark, I could
just see my report.

649
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,345
They would
tar and feather me...

650
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,948
and run me out of
this town on a rail.

651
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,250
You think so?

652
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,018
Ha ha ha!
That sounds like...

653
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,420
a whole lot of fun
to me.

654
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,589
Oh, yeah!
Oh, boy!

655
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,358
Why don't we just go over
there and talk to her?

656
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,361
Do it for me.
Come on.

657
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,362
Johnny?

658
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,864
Johnny, I got
that info for you.

659
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,833
Yeah, Molly,
go ahead.

660
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,868
Let's see.
Sherry Ouelette--

661
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,837
parents died
in a car accident...

662
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,505
on 7-10-83.

663
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,708
William Gartley
is her legal guardian.

664
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,276
Is that it?

665
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,777
Yeah. Who's picking up
the tab...

666
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,446
for my overtime?

667
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,947
Take it out
of my pension.

668
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,649
You're the best,
Molly.

669
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,447
You got that right.

670
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,973
Oh, man.

671
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,409
So who's going to
pop the ques--

672
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,244
You don't
say a word.

673
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,872
Right? Not a word.

674
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,177
Far out.
Gothic.

675
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:18,963
Who is it?

676
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,499
Sherry? Hi. It's
Officer John Hunton...

677
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,468
from the police
department.

678
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,004
- Hi. Remember me?
- Hello.

679
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,673
Mm-hmm.

680
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,474
I'm here to ask you
some questions...

681
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,276
about the accidents that
have been happening...

682
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,679
at the Blue Ribbon
Laundry.

683
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,314
Are you
a policeman, too?

684
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,612
No. I'm
a theoretical--

685
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,053
Um, this is
Mark Jackson.

686
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,122
He's a student...
an observer.

687
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,250
Then I guess
it's all right.

688
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,188
Thank you.
It won't take long.

689
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:57,691
I

690
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,005
Is your uncle here?

691
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,608
I'm alone.

692
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,649
Oh, hey,
look at those.

693
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,285
They're beautiful.

694
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,687
Look at that
little face!

695
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,289
Are they yours?

696
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,391
No, they're not
really mine.

697
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,127
My uncle says
they'll be mine someday.

698
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,729
Um...

699
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,430
Sherry, I'm really
sorry to disturb you...

700
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,965
at a time like this.

701
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,700
I just have
a few questions. OK?

702
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,202
OK.

703
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,636
It's OK?

704
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,671
Mm-hmm.

705
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,306
All right.

706
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,475
Now, Annette said that
you cut your hand...

707
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,543
on a clamp.

708
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,579
How did that happen?

709
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,381
Getting out
of the way...

710
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,316
of that icebox.

711
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,451
These two guys
lost control.

712
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,953
I guess it...

713
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,055
it hit the feed belt.

714
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,523
On the mangler?

715
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:53,624
Yeah.

716
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,927
Then it bounced off
and almost hit me.

717
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,930
Did this icebox
hit the safety bar?

718
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,732
I think it did.

719
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,035
There were bright
sparks everywhere.

720
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,871
What, sparks like
a wire had been cut?

721
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,372
I saw a big flash...

722
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:11,275
like lightning
or something.

723
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:18,416
That's it, then.
There it is.

724
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,648
I really loved
Mrs. Frawley.

725
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,589
Shh.

726
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,725
She was like
a mother to me.

727
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,627
I tried to help her.

728
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,429
I pulled as hard
as I could...

729
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,164
but I was too weak.

730
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,266
It's OK.
Hey, Sherry, Sherry.

731
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,267
Sherry. Sherry...

732
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,469
you're a very
brave young woman.

733
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,937
OK?

734
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,972
Sherry, I just want--

735
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,642
Mark!

736
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,143
The icebox
hit the safety bar.

737
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,112
That's it.
Thank you very much.

738
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,014
Bye-bye. It was
a short circuit.

739
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,849
That's all
there is to it.

740
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,350
Let's go.
Mark! Mark!

741
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,952
Sherry,
are you a virgin?

742
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,988
Excuse me?
What is this?

743
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,957
Just get out!

744
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,427
Just get the hell out!

745
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,496
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

746
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,498
I'm right!
I'm right.

747
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,567
She's definitely
a virgin.

748
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,568
Jesus Christ!

749
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,569
I can't believe
you did that--

750
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,370
What? Talk to
a little girl like that.

751
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,872
God! Have fun?

752
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,373
Shit, I hope
you had fun.

753
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,342
It's not a question of fun.
I know I'm right.

754
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,277
Shut up, goddamn it.

755
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,313
No more about virgins,
alright.

756
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,415
I'm right.

757
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,083
What are you--some
kind of pervert?

758
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:31,889
Doesn't matter
whether I'm a pervert...

759
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,091
What is this?

760
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,593
Oh, Christ.

761
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,294
What the hell is going on
at Mrs. Smith's house?

762
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:38,863
I don't know.
Whatever it is...

763
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:43,067
you stay the hell
out of it, alright.

764
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,035
There he is!
There he is!

765
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,867
Stop him!

766
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,910
Mark! Mark!

767
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,912
Stay in the car.

768
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,780
All right.

769
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,415
You stay in the car!

770
00:41:58,415 --> 00:41:59,917
All right!
All right!

771
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,352
Hey, Steele...

772
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,453
what is this?

773
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,787
Hi, Johnny.
It's really bad.

774
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,223
The boy's suffocated.

775
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,725
It's Barry Ellenshaw.

776
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,226
Been missing all day.

777
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,761
Mrs. Smith just learned
10 minutes ago.

778
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,329
I found that icebox...

779
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,797
when I got here
this morning.

780
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,299
He never got
in any trouble.

781
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,500
He'd no more play...

782
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,501
in a refrigerator
than...

783
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,003
All right.

784
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,305
The boy's dog was barking
outside the icebox.

785
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,208
That's why
I had a look inside.

786
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,210
Oh, Barry.

787
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,712
Suffocated, poor kid.

788
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,649
He's been missing
since 11:00 this morning.

789
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,251
Come on, honey.

790
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,947
Rest in peace, Barry.

791
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,626
Barry Ellenshaw--
oh, man.

792
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,618
Poor kid.

793
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,832
Hell of a shame,
huh, Johnny?

794
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,611
Get him out of here.

795
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:05,449
Stand back there.

796
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,680
Stand back.

797
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,488
No! No!

798
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,424
No! No,
Maryanne. No!

799
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,861
Barry!
Stop! Oh, my baby!

800
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,160
Stay there.
Stay there.

801
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,216
No!

802
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:43,176
Barry!

803
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,858
It's not my fault.

804
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:50,027
I had nothing
to do with it.

805
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,630
It was here when
I came home from work.

806
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,131
What? It's not yours?

807
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,599
No. I don't know
where it came from.

808
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,001
Hey, Johnny...

809
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,095
come have a look
at this.

810
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,822
Wait a minute.

811
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,824
What? This is
the son of a bitch...

812
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,426
that almost hit Sherry?

813
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:28,966
After it hit
the mangler.

814
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,525
Transference.

815
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:35,205
It's transference
of evil.

816
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,174
Oh, bullshit.

817
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:41,011
Evil. Bullshit.

818
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,570
Easy.

819
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,850
What?

820
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,986
Shit.

821
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,988
It's all right.

822
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,219
It's all right,
little baby.

823
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,429
It's all right, baby.
Come on.

824
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,497
Aah!

825
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,865
Jeez!

826
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,133
Let go!

827
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:08,037
Aah! Aah!

828
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,643
Are you all right?

829
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,879
Yeah. I think so.
Oh, shit.

830
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,780
Jesus H. Christ.

831
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,118
A hammer--
you got a hammer?

832
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:22,609
It's in the garage.

833
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,417
Ow!

834
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,954
Miserable piece
of dogfuck!

835
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,718
Goddamn you!

836
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,029
Oh, oh, God.

837
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,766
God!

838
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,434
Jesus Christ!

839
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,871
God!

840
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,273
Lend not thy sight
to idols...

841
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,141
nor make gods
of thyself!

842
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,137
Nice work, Johnny.

843
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,140
I always knew
you had it in you.

844
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,811
Where did you learn
to do magic tricks?

845
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,215
That was the first ghost
I have ever seen.

846
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,516
Thank you, my boy.

847
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,552
Just when you thought
you'd seen it all...

848
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:05,122
life bites you in the ass.

849
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,658
See you later, Johnny.

850
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,752
I'll be waiting for you.

851
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,969
What the fuck
was that?

852
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:24,099
Jesus Christ.

853
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,726
Get that thing
out of my sight!

854
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,328
And burn it...

855
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,930
then bury it.

856
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,729
Drive a fucking stake
through its heart.

857
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:55,395
I

858
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,916
So, what do you
think now, hmm?

859
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,551
Do you know
any priests?

860
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,486
No, man. Do you?

861
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:12,656
No. I knew
a rabbi one time.

862
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,691
They'd think we're nuts.

863
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:17,227
We are nuts.

864
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,527
It's our play, Johnny.
It's up to us.

865
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,970
Why don't we just
get some dynamite...

866
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,606
and blow the shit
out of the pig?

867
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,942
Brute force isn't
the answer, man.

868
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,577
I mean, a demon
may be trapped...

869
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,112
in that piece
of machinery.

870
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:36,613
There's a chance
it could get out.

871
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,683
It would love to get out
and love to kill.

872
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,485
Oh, good. Good.

873
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,086
Virgin blood.

874
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,088
That's the key.
It's got to be.

875
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,590
The trouble is,
there's many...

876
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,325
different kinds
of demons.

877
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,294
I mean, I don't know what
we're dealing with here.

878
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:52,129
It could be in the
cycle of Bubastis...

879
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,464
Pan, Dionysius.

880
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,833
You following me?

881
00:48:56,833 --> 00:49:00,235
No...but go on.

882
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:06,443
I have to isolate
the exact cause.

883
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,045
We have to make sure...

884
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,346
that we use
the right ritual...

885
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,114
because the rites
of exorcism--

886
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,115
I don't know
if you understand...

887
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,283
but the rites
of exorcism...

888
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,451
that's really heavy stuff.

889
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,688
That's like controlled
nuclear fission, in a way.

890
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,923
I mean, we make one mistake,
that's it. We're dead.

891
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,726
We're destroyed.

892
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:23,760
I mean, if you ask
me, this is...

893
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,998
just an act of
random possession.

894
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,433
It's got to be.

895
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,304
Hey, Mark.

896
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:38,565
I got to do
some thinking.

897
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,081
Oh, Johnny...

898
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,149
listen, man,
don't worry, OK?

899
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,285
I'm with you 100%,
man, OK?

900
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,621
All right, Mark.
That's a relief, man.

901
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,689
100%.

902
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,419
That's real reassuring.

903
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:10,673
Belladonna,
demonic possessions...

904
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,544
Oh, I'm having fun.

905
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:15,879
Hey! I'm with you, man.

906
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,815
There are stranger things
in heaven and earth...

907
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,918
John Hunton, than are
dreamt of in your philosophy.

908
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,386
Ha ha ha!

909
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,416
Hey, Johnny,
what do you know?

910
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,920
Not much, Charlie.

911
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,513
Just going to the morgue.

912
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,089
Whew. Not much.

913
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,257
Barry, Barry, Barry,
it's been a hell of a day.

914
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,488
Fix you up
in the morning.

915
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,967
He's a brave kid.

916
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,535
He put up
a hell of a fight.

917
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,871
Broke his arm
in six places.

918
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,874
It was suffocation, right?

919
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,442
Mr. Hunton...

920
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,411
we've been expecting you.

921
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,279
You've come to see
Mrs. Frawley.

922
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,781
Yep.

923
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,250
She was a real challenge.

924
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,752
I had practically
nothing to go on.

925
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,455
Hardly recognized the parts--
the ones that came in.

926
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,091
You look at her now.

927
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:11,094
I think I did
a pretty damn good job...

928
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,596
considering
the raw materials...

929
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,498
I had to work with.

930
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:15,966
Can you keep a secret?

931
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,467
I had to fill up
her body with--

932
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,702
I hate secrets.

933
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:19,703
OK.

934
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:20,704
- OK?
- Yeah.

935
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:21,738
- You need to be alone.
- Right.

936
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:22,839
You've come to do
some thinking.

937
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:23,940
Thank you.

938
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,108
I'll be in my office.

939
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,177
OK. I'll call you
if I need anything.

940
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,179
She's headed to the
cemetery in the morning.

941
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,747
Until then,
she's all yours.

942
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,015
Good. Thank you.

943
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,384
Oh, her personal
possessions?

944
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,586
- They're right here.
- Great.

945
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:37,587
That's all
they brought in.

946
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,588
Thanks.

947
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:39,623
Cherry tomato?

948
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:43,651
No, thank you.
Thank you. Bye-bye, now.

949
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,630
Oh, Jesus.

950
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:20,887
I

951
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,167
You won't mind,
will you?

952
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:51,394
Jesus, I got to
get a life.

953
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:55,265
Boo! Gotcha!

954
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,461
Very funny.

955
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:05,041
She looks...pretty good,
don't she?

956
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,169
Oh, yeah.
She looks great.

957
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,984
Johnny. Johnny!

958
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,185
Do you want to
come downstairs...

959
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,786
and finish off
that gin game...

960
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,421
we started
three years ago?

961
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,957
I've still got a drop
of that old Irish whiskey.

962
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,792
You know,
I get the feeling...

963
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,595
you don't like me anymore.

964
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,430
No.

965
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,729
It's my job I don't
like anymore.

966
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,436
Oh.

967
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:37,274
Well, it doesn't
matter much anyway.

968
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,842
You won't have to look
at my ugly mug...

969
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,970
around here much longer.

970
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,115
Why?

971
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,116
Don't tell me...

972
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,751
you're moving out
of this hellhole?

973
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:50,687
Oh, something
like that.

974
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:53,523
The doc says
I'm going fast.

975
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:59,292
I'm being
eaten up...inside.

976
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,978
I'm sorry to hear that.

977
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,813
Ah, don't be.

978
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,749
We all have to
go sometime.

979
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,787
Johnny, you and I--

980
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:27,622
we share the same ghosts.

981
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:33,687
To forgive is divine...

982
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,627
especially if you can
forgive yourself.

983
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,910
Oh, did you get pictures
of that icebox?

984
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,378
Oh, yeah.

985
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:51,614
Yeah, I'm off down
to the darkroom now.

986
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,316
What was that?

987
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:54,417
What?

988
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:57,520
That ghost.

989
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,190
We live in strange
times, Johnny--

990
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,959
very strange times.

991
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:05,762
I'll have the photos
ready later tonight.

992
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,597
Come on by.

993
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:11,267
I'll be
waiting for you.

994
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,402
You know,
I'm 50 points up...

995
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:13,570
on you in that game.

996
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,971
I've got an ace
up my sleeve...

997
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,973
I'm dying to play.

998
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,041
You know
where to find me.

999
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,409
You don't want
to lose...

1000
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,969
to an old hack like me.

1001
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,682
Shit.

1002
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,915
Fuck.

1003
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,954
God! God! God!

1004
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:53,229
God!

1005
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:54,998
What are you doing?

1006
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,499
Where the hell
is Gartley?

1007
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:57,500
He's out of town.

1008
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,601
Yeah, right.

1009
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,298
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come back here!

1010
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,340
Hey, stop!

1011
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,673
Goddamn it,
he's out of town!

1012
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,215
Get your hands off
of me...

1013
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,550
you lying sack of shit.

1014
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,951
You want to go downtown?
You want to go downtown?

1015
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:18,354
Boys! Boys! Boys! Boys!

1016
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:22,592
All right. Knock it off.

1017
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:26,262
Get out, George.
I'll deal with you later.

1018
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:30,333
Come in, Mr. Hunton.
I've been expecting you.

1019
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:34,671
So sorry I missed you earlier.

1020
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:38,541
You know, Stanner tells me
you're quite the detective.

1021
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,845
A regular Sherlock Holmes
of the dead, hmm?

1022
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:45,381
Why don't you
shut that thing down...

1023
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,951
before somebody else
gets hurt?

1024
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,953
What, am I
going to have to...

1025
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,055
shut you down?

1026
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:55,792
Tsk tsk tsk. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

1027
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,193
Mmm. Bad career move.

1028
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:04,000
Are you threatening me?

1029
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,170
Is that a threat?
Go on, threaten me.

1030
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,171
I'll shove
them crutches...

1031
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,936
up your moldy ass,
you fucking clown.

1032
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,045
Ha ha ha!

1033
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,514
I like that. Threaten?

1034
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,116
Uh-huh.

1035
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:25,321
No, no, no. Threaten
is far too...kind a word.

1036
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,256
This goddamn machine
tried to kill me!

1037
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,227
Aah!

1038
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:34,998
Breaking and entering
is a serious crime, of?cEr.

1039
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:37,400
Perhaps I should have
you arrested, hmm?

1040
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,968
Yeah. OK.
Ok. Hey. Yeah.

1041
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,470
Have me arrested.
Have me arrested.

1042
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,804
I'm going to shut
you down...

1043
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,796
you sick son of a bitch.

1044
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:52,582
I will not have you
tamper with my affairs.

1045
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:54,050
I'll have you suspended!

1046
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,652
Hey, all your
powerful friends...

1047
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,153
and all your money...

1048
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,789
don't mean shit
to me, Gartley.

1049
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,290
Ha ha ha!

1050
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:04,961
My power has nothing
to do with money.

1051
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:08,297
Power is energy.
Power is motivation.

1052
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:11,234
Power is what
holds things together...

1053
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:14,370
when they would
rather fly apart.

1054
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,807
It's a complex world
out there, sporty.

1055
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:20,810
Many things you
do not understand.

1056
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:25,448
But...understand this.

1057
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:28,918
There's a little bit
of me in that machine...

1058
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:32,622
and a little bit of
it in me.

1059
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:36,059
We are the lifeblood
of this town.

1060
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:42,298
Gartley, what are you
talking about?

1061
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:47,032
We all have to
make sacrifices.

1062
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:56,312
You're right.
Everything has its price.

1063
01:01:56,312 --> 01:02:01,284
Yeah. Yes, it does.
Well, do come again.

1064
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:04,620
This has been delightful.

1065
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:09,251
And, uh...drive
carefully, won't you?

1066
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,694
Fuck you!

1067
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:20,995
What?

1068
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:43,816
I

1069
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,450
That S.O.B.

1070
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,453
He thinks he's going to
shut down our machine.

1071
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,954
Ha ha ha!

1072
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,123
Well, sir, I've been
thinking...

1073
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,820
maybe it should be
shut down.

1074
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:24,467
Yeah...how long you
worked here, George?

1075
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,435
15 years.

1076
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:30,840
15 years. Well, you're--
you're practically...

1077
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,110
part of our little family,
then, aren't you, hmm?

1078
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:40,216
I assume you'll be helping us
run this town, hmm?

1079
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:45,021
I've known that machine
since I was a little boy.

1080
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,223
My daddy bought it.

1081
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:50,760
Best business decision
he ever made, I'll tell you.

1082
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,930
My God, Mr. Gartley, sir.

1083
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:58,891
That--that machine
killed your daughter.

1084
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,994
Look what
it's done to you.

1085
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:06,676
Yeah. Sacrifices, George.

1086
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,678
We all have to
make them.

1087
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,380
Hell, boy. You could say
that machine out there...

1088
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,449
made me what I am.

1089
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,817
Mr. Gartley, if
you're not going to...

1090
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:20,389
deal with it,
then maybe I should.

1091
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:24,694
Oh, don't
be a fool, George.

1092
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:29,031
Don't throw away
a bright future here.

1093
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:33,569
I'm worried.
I'm worried, uh...

1094
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:36,205
it's been troubling me.

1095
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:41,508
Well, George, let your own
conscience be your guide.

1096
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,650
Good evening, Martha.

1097
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:24,921
Bill. Bill Gartley.
Sorry to call so late.

1098
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,023
Let me speak to
the good sheriff...

1099
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,524
won't you, Martha?

1100
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:30,226
Thank you.

1101
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,894
Evening, Hughes.
Now listen...

1102
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:33,629
I'm having
a little problem...

1103
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:36,032
with one of the boys.

1104
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:39,602
Yeah. That's the fellow.
That's right.

1105
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:44,438
Now you deal with him.
Yeah, good.

1106
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:48,544
Fuck him.

1107
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:50,376
John?

1108
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,783
What?

1109
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,786
Take some time off.
There's no case here, son.

1110
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,187
Take a vacation!

1111
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,523
OK, Mr. Gartley.

1112
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:03,826
Now you're suspended,
Officer Hunton.

1113
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:06,529
Hey, how much is he
paying you, Hughes?

1114
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,264
OK, pal.
You're terminated!

1115
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,256
And kiss that
pension good-bye.

1116
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,862
How are we feeling,
my dear, hmm?

1117
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:43,799
Strange.
I'm getting sick.

1118
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:50,839
Are you ready for bed?

1119
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,811
Yes.

1120
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:59,215
No! No.

1121
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:03,853
There's something
I must show you.

1122
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,412
Come.

1123
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,925
Aah!

1124
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,929
Must be here somewhere.

1125
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,626
Aha! Yeah.

1126
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:27,143
My baby daughter's
death certificate.

1127
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,478
Her passport to hell.

1128
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,914
She was only 16.

1129
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:34,583
Hmm. Well, survival
of the fittest...

1130
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,420
is the way of things.

1131
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,222
I mean, surely,
my child...

1132
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,258
you must have noticed
how Rikers Valley...

1133
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,494
is so ideally perfect, hmm?

1134
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:46,862
There's something
I want to show you.

1135
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:48,296
Just a moment here.

1136
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,468
Ah! Ah.

1137
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:05,114
This...is my contract--

1138
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:08,918
my deal...
with the beast--

1139
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,478
the beast in the machine.

1140
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,894
What's happening to me?

1141
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:21,263
My child...

1142
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,065
there's a little
piece of you...

1143
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:25,568
in the mangler...

1144
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:29,839
and the essence
of it in you.

1145
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,899
You're one of us now.

1146
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:39,281
My signature.
See? Hmm?

1147
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,450
Oh. Understand now?

1148
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:45,254
Do we?

1149
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:47,089
Hmm?

1150
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,490
See?

1151
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:58,634
Welcome to the club.

1152
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:02,298
Oh, precious.

1153
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,731
Fuck!

1154
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:31,300
I've been studying, man.
Virgin's blood.

1155
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,170
Definitely virgin's
blood. It's got to be.

1156
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,704
Now, look.

1157
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:39,909
A little holy water,
a smidgen of Eucharist--

1158
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,677
that ought to do it.

1159
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,279
Then we'll read
some LEv?t?cus to it.

1160
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,914
Strictly Christian
white magic.

1161
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,682
Listen, I'll tell you
the truth.

1162
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:47,950
I was really worried...

1163
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,952
about that hand
of glory--belladonna.

1164
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:52,254
That's black juju.
Strong magic.

1165
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:53,355
Hey, Mark?

1166
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,356
I looked down...

1167
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,725
this son of a
bitch's throat.

1168
01:09:56,725 --> 01:09:59,261
Holy water ain't
going to do it.

1169
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,263
Yeah, well, a demon
conjured up...

1170
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,999
in conjunction with
the hand of glory can--

1171
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,501
I mean, that could eat...

1172
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:08,070
a stack of Bibles
for breakfast...

1173
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,739
but we don't have to
worry about that.

1174
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,074
Thank God.

1175
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,676
All right.

1176
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,811
Yeah. I hope you're right.

1177
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:17,780
I know I'm right.

1178
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,616
I don't.

1179
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:23,185
We got to go
talk to somebody.

1180
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:24,253
Come on.

1181
01:10:24,253 --> 01:10:26,055
Hold up!

1182
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,648
Damn it, hold up!

1183
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:29,915
I

1184
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,783
I don't know
about this, George.

1185
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:57,686
What the hell
took you so long?

1186
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,622
I'm sorry.

1187
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:02,224
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing?

1188
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,159
Yeah. Now, don't start
arguing with me now.

1189
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,894
Go over there,
cut all power...

1190
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,429
and pull the breakers.

1191
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,057
I'll start
on the feeder.

1192
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:30,853
Sherry?
What are you doing here?

1193
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,421
I have to see my uncle.

1194
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,857
That's not a good idea.
He's very upset.

1195
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,692
I can't work here anymore.

1196
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,827
The police came
and asked me questions.

1197
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:41,030
I got to speak to him.

1198
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,799
Police. That figures.

1199
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:46,702
Just don't go up there.
He's busy.

1200
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:50,372
Lin Sue's with him,
isn't she?

1201
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:54,610
Sherry, go on home now.

1202
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:56,704
I have to talk to him.

1203
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:02,084
Oh, oh, oh. I'm caught!

1204
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,385
Mr. Stanner!

1205
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:06,922
I'm caught!
Help me! Aah!

1206
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:08,724
Mr. Stanner!

1207
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:11,727
The fuses! Jesus!

1208
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:12,861
Aah!

1209
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:16,131
Mr. Stanner!
Mr. Stanner!

1210
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:19,635
Aah!

1211
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:23,094
Aah! Turn it off!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1212
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:29,845
Aah!

1213
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,647
Mr. Gartley!

1214
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:36,085
Aah! Oh, help me!
Help me! Oh, please!

1215
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,086
Please!

1216
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:38,554
Do something!

1217
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,522
Do something?
Do something?

1218
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:41,990
I'll do something.

1219
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,992
I'll dance,
that's what I'll do.

1220
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,729
I'll do a little
dance for you, Sherry.

1221
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,997
Oh, God. Mr. Gartley!

1222
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:50,488
A little jig.

1223
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,337
I need your help now.

1224
01:12:55,337 --> 01:13:03,512
We're running out
of time. Come on.

1225
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,448
Please! Please! Aah!

1226
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:08,117
Uncle Bill, please!

1227
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:09,618
Move like there's
no tomorrow.

1228
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,453
We're on the clock.

1229
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:12,788
Aah!

1230
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:15,524
Do it! Do it!

1231
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:16,525
I can't!

1232
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:21,563
Do it! Do it!
Do it now!

1233
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,732
Oh, Christ.
I can't, George.

1234
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:28,570
Do it! Aah! Do it!
Do it! Do it!

1235
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,172
Christ!

1236
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:31,606
Do it!

1237
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,905
Very good, children.

1238
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:40,416
Come here to
your Uncle Bill.

1239
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,580
Sherry! Sherry!

1240
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:59,996
I used to have all...
the time...in the world.

1241
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:07,271
Damn her. Damn her.

1242
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,372
Hey, hey. Hey, man...

1243
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:38,507
where the hell
we going?

1244
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,306
We're going to
go talk to an old man.

1245
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,350
Oh, no. What
the hell is this?

1246
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,436
No. Take me back.

1247
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:11,771
Joey, stop!
Don't argue. Just do it.

1248
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:27,289
I was just drinking
my tea, and...

1249
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,792
you're all right.
Hey, you'll be OK.

1250
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:32,728
You're going to be
all right.

1251
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,162
You'll be OK.

1252
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:40,435
Thanks for coming and
visiting me, Johnny.

1253
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:44,270
You made an old man
very happy.

1254
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,970
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

1255
01:15:54,516 --> 01:16:00,422
Downstairs...
in my office.

1256
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:03,592
Present for you.

1257
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:07,927
You have to
exorcise your demon.

1258
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,835
Don't let it
possess your soul.

1259
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,001
Oh.

1260
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,452
Argh!

1261
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,456
Aah!

1262
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,932
Shit!

1263
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:31,670
I

1264
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:01,509
Jesus!

1265
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,373
Oh, man.

1266
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:48,657
It wasn't your fault.

1267
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:52,260
I was driving the car.

1268
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,895
Accidents happen.

1269
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:57,525
People make mistakes,
but they carry on.

1270
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,748
Johnny.

1271
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,459
Take a look at this.

1272
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,725
This is my present.

1273
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,112
"Maryanne Gartley...

1274
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,113

She was 16 years old."

1281
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:58,553
There's Maryanne.

1282
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:02,430
"Sarah Krandel...

1286
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,705
That's Sarah.

1287
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,308
"Suzanne Bishop

01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:31,960
Well, these are all
the rich people...

1295
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,763
the old money--

1296
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,264
the people
that want nothing...

1297
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:41,303
need nothing more...

1298
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:44,539
Power. Power.

1299
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,405
What is this?

1300
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,145
Wait a minute.

1301
01:20:50,145 --> 01:20:52,747
Everything has
its price.

1302
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:54,583
The price of power...

1303
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,419
Gartley said
something about...

1304
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,554
No, Gartley said...

1305
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,887
that we all have to
make sacrifices.

1306
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:06,023
Human sacrifices.

1307
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,653
Sherry?

1308
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:12,534
Jesus Christ.

1309
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:33,188
Hi. Sherry? This is
Officer Hunton.

1310
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:36,158
Mr. Stanner's dead.

1311
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:42,230
I just went
to see my uncle.

1312
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,099
Um, listen, Sherry.

1313
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:46,101
I want you to stay inside.

1314
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,103
I want you to stay
in the house.

1315
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,204
Lock the doors.
Stay in the house.

1316
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:50,205
You'll be safe...

1317
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,239
as long as you stay
in the house.

1318
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,504
What's going on?

1319
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,841
How old are you,
Sherry? 16?

1320
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:00,982
Really?

1321
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:02,350
OK. Stay inside.

1322
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,351
Do what I told you, OK?

1323
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:04,352
I'll explain everything...

1324
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:05,387
when I get there.

1325
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:08,118
I'll be there as
soon as I can, OK?

1326
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,562
The mangler got
the foreman.

1327
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:17,065
Today's her birthday.
She's 16.

1328
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:18,863
It's her birthday?

1329
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,036
We're running
out of time.

1330
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:41,589
Happy birthday,
my child.

1331
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:44,592
Surprised to see
your Uncle Bill?

1332
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:46,094
What do you want?

1333
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,562
Why, you, of course.

1334
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:50,798
Leave me alone.

1335
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:55,170
Ohh...

1336
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:58,629
aren't you going to
blow out your candles?

1337
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:01,609
Come on.

1338
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,111
Go ahead, Sherry.

1339
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:05,613
Make a wish.

1340
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,115
I wish you were dead.

1341
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:09,351
Ha ha!
No doubt about it...

1342
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,619
girl's got
true Gartley spirit.

1343
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:15,623
Uhh!

1344
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:19,627
Oh, what a waste,
but then...

1345
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:21,629
we all...

1346
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:24,132
have to make sacrifices.

1347
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:25,900
Heh heh!

1348
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:29,393
Now, now, now.

1349
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,711
Uh, no!

1350
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:40,148
Oh, I'm so sorry
it had to be you...

1351
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:42,650
but I must
not be selfish...

1352
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,519
when I make
my decision...

1353
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,488
so it's time...

1354
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,523
to turn in
your dance card.

1355
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:49,724
Heh heh!

1356
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:53,194
I do hope you'll accept
my apology...

1357
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:56,698
but I must choose
between you and me...

1358
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,826
and of course,
I choose...

1359
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,601
me.

1360
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,148
Come, darling.

1361
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:15,117
We're running
out of time.

1362
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,655
Stop! Stop!

1363
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,490
We haven't got time, Mark.

1364
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,025
I have to rehearse.

1365
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:25,026
We haven't got time!

1366
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:27,495
I have to rehearse.

1367
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:29,164
All right. Fuck!

1368
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:30,765
OK, I'm going to read.

1369
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:31,866
Now, I might read
from the Latin...

1370
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:32,867
I might read
from the English...

1371
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,836
but I'm going to
read anyway.

1372
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:37,205
OK, this--this--

1373
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:39,908
this, my friend,
is holy water.

1374
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,409
Holy water. Fine.

1375
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:44,045
When I give you the signal,
you take this...

1376
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:45,847
and you sprinkle it
on the machine...

1377
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,949
and you say, "In the name
of the Father...

1378
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,851
"the Son,
and the Holy Ghost...

1379
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:51,252
"Get thee from this place.

1380
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:52,487
Thou art unclean."

1381
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:53,855
OK, this is the host.
You break the host.

1382
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,323
OK. OK. The host. Alright.

1383
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:56,591
You put it on the machine.

1384
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,493
You repeat the incantation.

1385
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:00,361
Oh! The hand of glory--

1386
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:02,130
Now we don't have to
worry about that.

1387
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,631
Shit. Get in the car.

1388
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:05,200
Get in the goddamn car!

1389
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,801
You always do this to me!

1390
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:08,099
Wait up!

1391
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:13,965
I

1392
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:36,664
God of all machines...

1393
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:41,625
God that meshes
good and evil...

1394
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:47,675
accept this blood
of my blood...

1395
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:51,179
because I am
signing off--

1396
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,341
payment in full!

1397
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,609
See you later, Sherry.

1398
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,191
Sherry!

1399
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,859
No!

1400
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,861
Piss off!

1401
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,159
Get on out.

1402
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:46,201
You've got no right!
You have no right!

1403
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,702
Oh...

1404
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:48,970
You have no right!

1405
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:50,138
Agh!

1406
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:55,510
No right!
No right! No...

1407
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:58,112
Aah!

1408
01:26:58,112 --> 01:26:59,910
God!

1409
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:05,143
Goddamn you!

1410
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:11,359
You miserable piece
of dogfuck!

1411
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,349
How dare you!

1412
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:19,658
No!

1413
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:23,004
So this is
the price of power?

1414
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:24,739
This is the price
of power?

1415
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:27,242
Ugh! No!

1416
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,111
No! No! No!

1417
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:32,013
No!

1418
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:40,288
Here's the truth,
Gartley. It's done.

1419
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:43,992
No! No!

1420
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:46,027
No!

1421
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:47,859
Lin Sue.

1422
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:51,466
No!

1423
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,869
Aaah!

1424
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,467
Lin Sue!

1425
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:05,179
Lin Sue!

1426
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:08,182
OK? Stay with me.

1427
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:09,650
Trespassers!

1428
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:17,191
Lin Sue!

1429
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:19,820
My Lin Sue!

1430
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,897
Off the clock.

1431
01:28:29,604 --> 01:28:31,573
Out of time?

1432
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,446
Argh!

1433
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:19,921
My God,
who art in hell...

1434
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:25,460
cursed be thy name...

1435
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:31,559
Why, you lying
son of a b-b-b--

1436
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:36,003
Fuck you.

1437
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,779
Stay back!
Stay back!

1438
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:46,614
What do you
want me to do?

1439
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:47,815
Help me.

1440
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:49,350
OK, when I point to you,
you take the holy water...

1441
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,119
and sprinkle it
in the machine...

1442
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:54,689
and you say, "Glor?a ?n
ExcEls?s sp?r?tu omn?bus."

1443
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,124
Omn?bus.
OK, all right.

1444
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:58,292
Glor?a ?n ExcEls?s
sp?r?tu sancto omn?bus.

1445
01:29:58,292 --> 01:30:00,962
Then you put the host in.

1446
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:03,056
- Repeat the incantation.
- Alright.

1447
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:15,341
Glor?a ?n ExcEls?s
sp?r?tu sancto omn?bus.

1448
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:22,617
In the host!

1449
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,553
Aah!

1450
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:27,255
In the name
of the Father...

1451
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,190
the Son,
and the Holy Ghost...

1452
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:36,864
get thee from this place!
Thou art unclean!

1453
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:40,596
Holy shit! This
ain't working! Shit.

1454
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:52,346
[Reading in Latin]

1455
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:54,882
Our Father,
who art in heaven...

1456
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:57,351
hallowed be thy name.

1457
01:30:57,351 --> 01:30:59,353
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

1458
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:01,322
on earth as it is
in heaven.

1459
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:02,623
Give us this day
our daily bread...

1460
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:03,818
and forgive us
our trespasses...

1461
01:31:05,793 --> 01:31:07,295
Trespass against us...

1462
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,297
and lead us not
into temptation...

1463
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:10,998
but deliver us
from evil...

1464
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:12,633
for thine is the power...

1465
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:14,702
and the glory forever--

1466
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:17,271
...sight to idols...

1467
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:20,641
nor make gods
of thyself...

1468
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:24,312
for the land will
vomit you up...

1469
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,880
for defiling it...

1470
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,783
as it vomited up
nations before thee!

1471
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:32,845
Amen, goddamn it!

1472
01:31:53,841 --> 01:31:56,344
Look! Yeah!

1473
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,845
We did it!

1474
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,847
Huh? We did it!

1475
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:01,247
We did it!

1476
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:05,553
We did it.

1477
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:07,788
Ha ha ha!

1478
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:09,256
It's dead!

1479
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,303
Uhh! Oh, man.

1480
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:26,340
Now I know where you get
your flaky stomach from.

1481
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:28,342
Let me take
one of those.

1482
01:32:28,342 --> 01:32:30,711
I don't do drugs, man,
but I need this.

1483
01:32:30,711 --> 01:32:32,513
You OK? Really?

1484
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:33,514
What's in this?

1485
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:36,150
I don't know.
They're antacids.

1486
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,914
I got them
from Mrs. Frawley.

1487
01:32:42,356 --> 01:32:44,492
Belladonna?

1488
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:46,825
You got these
from Mrs. Frawley?

1489
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:51,065
The hand of glory?

1490
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:53,034
I think we may be fucked.

1491
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:57,305
Aah!

1492
01:32:57,305 --> 01:32:58,973
Oh, God!

1493
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:00,464
Oh, what's this?

1494
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:13,521
Aah!

1495
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:18,289
- Oh, shit!
- Oh. Oh.

1496
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:21,128
Oh, God!

1497
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:24,030
No! Aah!

1498
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,636
Run! Run!

1499
01:33:28,636 --> 01:33:30,137
Mark!

1500
01:33:30,137 --> 01:33:32,003
Run! Run!

1501
01:33:33,474 --> 01:33:35,142
Out! Get out! Out!

1502
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:37,611
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1503
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:43,150
Do you know
a way out of here?

1504
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,642
No! No!

1505
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:58,630
Run! Run! Go!

1506
01:34:01,035 --> 01:34:02,936
[Sherry screaming]

1507
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:08,075
We're fucked!

1508
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:15,216
We're fucked!

1509
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:16,584
Oh, God!

1510
01:34:16,584 --> 01:34:20,021
No! Ohh!

1511
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:21,853
No! John!

1512
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:25,192
Mark!

1513
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:29,357
It--it won't open!

1514
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:33,100
If I walk
through the valley...

1515
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,870
of the shadow of death,
I fear no evil.

1516
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:37,532
Aaah!

1517
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:41,475
John! No!
Johnny!

1518
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:43,671
Mark!

1519
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:48,746
No! Mark!

1520
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,422
No!

1521
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,385
Come here!
What are you doing?

1522
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,387
Let go! Save yourself!
It wants me!

1523
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:27,722
Over my dead body!

1524
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,056
Are you crazy?

1525
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,458
No, I'm a policeman.

1526
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:32,256
But it wants me!
It wants me!

1527
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,900
Sherry!

1528
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:44,395
Sherry! Sherry!

1529
01:35:55,683 --> 01:35:57,618
Jump!

1530
01:36:08,362 --> 01:36:10,865
Leave her alone,
goddamn you!

1531
01:36:10,865 --> 01:36:13,300
Leave her alone!

1532
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:22,643
No! Goddamn you!

1533
01:36:22,643 --> 01:36:24,077
Leave her alone!

1534
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:35,456
Aah!

1535
01:36:57,011 --> 01:36:58,980
[Sherry gasping]

1536
01:37:11,959 --> 01:37:13,928
Ugh!

1537
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:28,565
I

1538
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:54,535
Sherry's all right.

1539
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,036
She's lost
a lot of blood...

1540
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:57,538
but she'll recover.

1541
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:00,040
Thank God.

1542
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,941
Mind telling me
what happened?

1543
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:09,450
Yeah, I do mind.

1544
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:14,488
Can I go see her?

1545
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:15,990
No.

1546
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,491
She's resting.

1547
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:19,517
Maybe tomorrow.

1548
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:29,503
OK. Thank you,
doctor.

1549
01:38:29,503 --> 01:38:30,971
Thank you.

1550
01:38:32,506 --> 01:38:33,974
Tomorrow.

1551
01:39:45,012 --> 01:39:46,981
Morning, officer.

1552
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:50,985
Have a nice day.

1553
01:39:55,756 --> 01:39:57,524
Dearest Johnny...

1554
01:39:57,524 --> 01:40:00,527
in this envelope, you'll
find vital information...

1555
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:02,529
that may save your life.

1556
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:06,100
The old-timers in
Rikers Valley had a saying--

1557
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:09,636
beware of people
with missing parts.

1558
01:40:09,636 --> 01:40:12,806
There's a piece of each
of them in the demon...

1559
01:40:12,806 --> 01:40:15,776
and a dose of the demon
in each of them.

1560
01:40:15,776 --> 01:40:18,178
"Faithfully yours...

1561
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:22,479
J.J.J. Pictureman."

1562
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:54,214
Herb!

1563
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:56,717
I've got a big load of sheets
coming within the hour!

1564
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:58,318
Now, get a move on!

1565
01:40:58,318 --> 01:41:01,220
Come on, ladies!
Move it up!

1566
01:41:02,322 --> 01:41:04,792
There's never enough
time around here!

1567
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:07,261
I'm not running
a charity here, Herb!

1568
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:09,663
Tell them to get their
lazy asses in gear!

1569
01:41:09,663 --> 01:41:10,664
Sherry?

1570
01:41:10,664 --> 01:41:13,964
You heard the boss!
Keep moving!

1571
01:41:47,968 --> 01:41:47,991
I

1572
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:14,544
I
