1
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,082
- Miss Appleby?
- Yes.

2
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,084
My name's Robert.
I'm your father's chauffeur.

3
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,764
I'm afraid your father couldn't come.

4
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,488
Oh, I'll do that.

5
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,007
Do you know why my father
didn't come to meet me?

6
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,051
- He's away, miss.
- He's not at the house?

7
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,363
- No, he went away four days ago.
- Where to?

8
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,444
I didn't even know he was going
until your mother told me he left.

9
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,443
She's my stepmother.
I've never met her.

10
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,961
Oh, you haven't?

11
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,443
What's she like?

12
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,651
- Well, miss, it's hardly my position--
- Please.

13
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,247
- She's my employer's wife, miss.
- What's she like as a person?

14
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,686
I don't know her as a person.

15
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,241
You must know something about her.
You drive her.

16
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,007
Only occasionally. She usually drives
herself or has Dr. Gerrard drive her.

17
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,367
- Who's he?
- He's your father's doctor.

18
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,410
- He's always up at the house.
- I didn't know my father was ill.

19
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,291
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't--
- What's wrong with him?

20
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,922
- I thought you'd have known that.
- No, I didn't know anything.

21
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,330
Oh, he's been ill for some time now.
That's what surprised me when--

22
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,087
- When what?
- Oh, it doesn't matter, miss.

23
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,565
You haven't been to France
for a long time, I understand.

24
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,484
Ten years.

25
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,326
What's wrong with my father?

26
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,090
I don't know, miss. But whatever
it was, he must be all right now.

27
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,846
- Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone.
- When will he be back?

28
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,246
Mrs. Appleby didn't say.

29
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,367
Hello, Penny. Welcome home.

30
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,285
- Jane?
- You sound surprised.

31
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,125
- Aren't I as you imagined?
- I'm sorry. I must sound rude.

32
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,886
Not a bit. Oh, take it through
to the hall, Robert...

33
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,566
...and then come back
for Miss Appleby.

34
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,128
- Was your journey terribly tiring?
- Not very.

35
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,045
It must've been a strain.
You haven't travelled much, have you?

36
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,680
- No, I haven't. But it was exciting.
- Good.

37
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,723
Careful, Robert.

38
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,843
The steps are quite a problem,
I'm afraid.

39
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,729
But we put ramps down
wherever we can.

40
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,600
I didn't think you'd want to use
the front door much.

41
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,683
We've put you
in one of your father's rooms.

42
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,050
He uses it as a sitting room
and a study. Fetch the cases, Robert.

43
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,522
It's very convenient, though.
It has its own bathroom.

44
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,969
UP We go.

45
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,646
It looks nice.

46
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,849
I made your father buy new curtains
and a couple of extra chairs.

47
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,526
You've no idea how dark
everything was.

48
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,763
Men always want to furnish their
studies like Victorian mausoleums.

49
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,366
Jane, where is Father?

50
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,364
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, darling.
It was unavoidable.

51
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,649
He simply had to go away on this
business deal that he's working on.

52
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,326
I tried to stop him,
but you know what your father is.

53
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,041
No, I'm afraid I don't.
I haven't seen him for 10 years.

54
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,884
I don't know if I'd recognise him.

55
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,565
Well, I've taken care of that.

56
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,727
Look, taken a month ago.

57
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,003
- Yes, I would've recognised him.
- Of course you would.

58
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,450
Oh, bring the cases in, Robert.

59
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,604
- Where do you want them, darling?
- On the bed, please.

60
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,647
- Would you like me to unpack for you?
- No, I can manage myself, thank you.

61
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,165
Is there anything more, madam?

62
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,130
No, that will be all, thank you.
I shan't need you again.

63
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,209
Well, I expect you want
to be alone now.

64
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,887
Dinner's at 8. I'll come and fetch you.
Oh, and, Penny, if you want anything...

65
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,886
...this bell here rings down to the
kitchen and up to my room as well.

66
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,087
Wonderful having you here.

67
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,121
Means so much to me.

68
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,562
Then when Mother died,
there was only Maggie Frensham.

69
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,687
I know she was just my nurse, but
she was much more than that really.

70
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,049
We were the same age, like sisters.

71
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,726
People said we even looked alike.

72
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,810
I think I loved her as much
as I did my mother.

73
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,960
Is that why you didn't come home
after your mother died?

74
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,929
This isn't my home.

75
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,809
I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound rude.
It's just that--

76
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,930
Well, I'd never met you,
and I hadn't seen Father for 10 years...

77
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,766
...ever since Mother took me to Italy
to live after they were divorced.

78
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,924
Well, Italy was my home.
I was brought up there.

79
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,003
As long as Maggie was with me,
I was happy.

80
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,721
And what actually happened?

81
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,683
She drowned.

82
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,689
Nobody knows how.
She was a good swimmer.

83
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,525
They said she must have
gotten cramped.

84
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,969
I nearly killed myself, Jane. I didn't
know what to do, who to turn to.

85
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,567
For two years since Mother died,
Maggie was all I had, everything...

86
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,769
...and then suddenly
she just wasn't there anymore.

87
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,564
It seems like yesterday
it all happened.

88
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,363
These things take time
to sort themselves out, darling.

89
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,128
After all, it was only three weeks.
You can't have got over it yet.

90
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,362
No, of course not.

91
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,291
Then, when Father wrote asking me
to come here to live, I--

92
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,568
But of course he did.
You're his daughter.

93
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,166
But this is your house,
and I wasn't sure if you--

94
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,641
But it was I who suggested
that he write to you.

95
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,327
Believe me, having you here
makes me very happy.

96
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,566
- You're very kind.
- Nonsense.

97
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,963
Did you expect me to be like
the wicked stepmother in the stories?

98
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,441
Honestly, I don't know what I expected.

99
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,323
It's a pity Father couldn't be here.

100
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,450
I was so cross when he said
he had to go away.

101
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,523
He was ill.

102
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,166
The chauffeur, Robert,
he said that Father was ill.

103
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,962
Well, I wonder why he said that.

104
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,282
There was nothing wrong with him,
nothing at all.

105
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,523
He said something
about a doctor. Doctor...?

106
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,447
Oh, yes, he meant Pierre Gerrard.
He's the doctor in the village.

107
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,921
He comes up and plays chess
with your father.

108
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,167
- I must speak to Robert. He shouldn't--
- No, please.

109
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,164
Don't let him get into trouble
on my account.

110
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,244
All right, if you want it that way.
Do you want some more coffee?

111
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,845
No, thank you.

112
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,210
Jane, would you excuse me
if I went to bed now?

113
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,647
Of course. You must be dead.

114
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,162
Look at me, behaving like an old hen
with one of her chicks.

115
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,602
Jane, thank you.
Thank you for everything.

116
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,969
I hope you can sleep, Penny.
The crickets make rather a noise.

117
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,886
- That's all right, I like crickets.
- Sometimes they're deafening.

118
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,521
Father?

119
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,209
Help! Help! Help!

120
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,485
Help!

121
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,846
- My darling, how do you feel?
- You're all right now.

122
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,721
Relax, young lady, there's nothing
to get excited about.

123
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,411
Pierre. Pierre.

124
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,325
It's all right, Jane.
Now, Penny, you've had a fright.

125
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,290
But you must realise that everything
is all right. You are safe.

126
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,681
What were you doing out there?
How did you fall in?

127
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,729
L-- I fell into the swimming pool.

128
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,326
Yes, Robert heard you.
He managed to get there in time.

129
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,448
- Father.
- Father's away. You know that.

130
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,602
He isn't. He's in the summerhouse.
I saw him.

131
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,162
- But he can't be, Penny.
- He was dead.

132
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,687
Penny, you had an accident,
but you really must try--

133
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,683
- Who are you?
- Dr. Gerrard, darling.

134
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,650
He was dead. He was in the
summerhouse, sitting in the chair.

135
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,883
- And I went in and I spoke to him.
- I'm going to give you a sedative.

136
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,042
In the morning,
everything will be all right.

137
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,567
But don't you understand
what I'm trying to say?

138
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,167
My father is dead.
His body's in the summerhouse.

139
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,845
Please, darling.
Please, you must--

140
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,401
Don't treat me as if I were
a mental defective.

141
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,165
- What are you doing?
- I want to go to the summerhouse now.

142
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,766
Very well,
if that makes you feel better.

143
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,681
- Where's my chair?
- It's at the bottom of the pool.

144
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,081
Robert will get it out in the morning.

145
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,481
Would you carry me, please?

146
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,761
- Go on, open it.
- But it's always kept locked.

147
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,246
- But it was open.
- It's always locked, Penny.

148
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,048
There was a candle.

149
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,644
There's no need
for a candle here, Penny.

150
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,608
Take me back now.

151
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,049
We won't want you anymore tonight,
thank you, Robert.

152
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,527
- Good night, doctor.
- Good night.

153
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,288
- Well, how are you feeling now?
- I'm sorry.

154
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,161
The imagination is a very funny thing.
It plays very unkind tricks at times.

155
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,800
It was probably the strain
of the journey.

156
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,361
Now I'm going to give you
a sedative.

157
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,808
- Sleep's the best cure for your trouble.
- If you say so.

158
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,849
You take this one now.

159
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,721
And in one hour, if you still
can't sleep, this one. All right?

160
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,411
- Good night.
- Good night.

161
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,125
There.

162
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,569
- I'm sorry, Jane.
- Don't worry, darling.

163
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,768
Try and get some sleep.

164
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,409
Good night, Penny.

165
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,330
Good night.

166
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,130
Come in.

167
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,041
I'm bringing you some petit-déjeuner.
My name is Marie.

168
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,043
I don't think I saw you here last night.

169
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,602
I do not live here, mademoiselle.
I have a house in the village.

170
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,967
Would you please see
what's happening to my chair?

171
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,124
- Your chair, mademoiselle?
- My wheelchair.

172
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,287
Good morning, darling.

173
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,164
How did you get from the bed?

174
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,050
I crawled.

175
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,441
You crawled, Penny?
What on earth for?

176
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,329
I couldn't sleep.

177
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,642
Did you take the other pill
that Pierre gave you?

178
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,564
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?

179
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,520
I didn't want to.
Jane, when will my chair be ready?

180
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,441
I'll find out, shall I?

181
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,408
Garage.
Oh, good morning, madam.

182
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,962
- Yes, ma'am, in about 10 minutes.
- Thank you, Robert.

183
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,726
He's cleaning it up.
He'll bring it around when it's ready.

184
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,530
Thank you, Jane.

185
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,767
- Are you feeling better this morning?
- A little tired.

186
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,683
I was so worried.

187
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,602
- Your father told me--
- Told you what?

188
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,047
- Oh, nothing.
- Please, Jane.

189
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,931
Well, he told me how you were
when you were a little girl.

190
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,721
Imaginative, fanciful, slightly...

191
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,929
- Neurotic?
- No, I didn't mean that.

192
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,606
I was, though.
I was afraid of everything.

193
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,809
Dark, wind, thunder, lightning.

194
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,407
- Most children are.
- They grow out of it.

195
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,089
Jane, what is that summerhouse
used for?

196
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,811
Penny, darling, whatever
you thought you saw last night...

197
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,564
...you must realise you imagined it.

198
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,644
Oh, I know that.
I'm just curious what it's used for.

199
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,806
Well, we keep old furniture there.
It's not used for anything nowadays.

200
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,962
Penny, darling, I've got to go out
this morning...

201
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,124
...and I've asked Robert
to show you around.

202
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,731
Won't you need him?

203
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,963
No, I can drive myself. We can't leave
you alone your first day here.

204
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,487
- Oh, Jane, I'll be all right.
- No, nonsense.

205
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,211
Well, I--
I've got to go and get dressed now.

206
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,805
Jane?

207
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,281
Did Father say
when he was coming back?

208
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,525
Not exactly, but I don't think
it'll be today, darling.

209
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,088
It's lovely here. It's so peaceful.

210
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,728
Yeah, it's my favourite spot.

211
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,401
We swim from here in the summer.

212
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,761
I don't swim.

213
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,604
Because of your legs?

214
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,842
- Have you tried?
- No.

215
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,447
You'd probably find
you could manage very well.

216
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,490
You're not one of those characters
who can't talk about their--

217
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,325
- Their afflictions, I think they call it?
- I don't think so.

218
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,689
Meaning that other people don't talk
about it in case it upsets you.

219
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,126
I guess you're right.

220
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,487
Why do people have to make
a big thing out of it?

221
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,168
- How long have you been like that?
- Nine years.

222
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,003
- You were on a horse, weren't you?
- The horse was on me.

223
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,325
You know, I bet that's the first time
you've joked about it.

224
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,369
I think it is.

225
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,250
Why do you hide behind
those things?

226
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,562
- Hide?
- That's why you wear them, isn't it?

227
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,803
Like a person who sits with his back
to the sun while talking to you.

228
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,566
- Is that what it looks like?
- It's true, isn't it?

229
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,200
I don't know.
I never really thought about it.

230
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,442
I feel more secure
when I'm wearing these.

231
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,365
I can watch people's eyes
and I know that they can't see mine.

232
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,241
- Well, why should you feel insecure?
- My legs, I suppose.

233
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,402
Being physically dependent
on other people...

234
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,562
...doesn't build up
your self-confidence.

235
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,643
You seem a pretty self-reliant person
to me.

236
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,210
My behaviour last night
wasn't very self-reliant.

237
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,044
Too much wine at dinner.

238
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,601
- Beginning to think you're right.
- Of course I am.

239
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,525
Alcoholic hallucination?

240
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,962
I didn't thank you for last night,
did I, Bob?

241
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,847
- Well, what for?
- You pulled me out of the pool.

242
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,047
All part of the service.

243
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,562
How long have you worked
for my father?

244
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,451
- Oh, two years.
- Do you like it?

245
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,049
It's the only way I get to drive
expensive cars and live on the Riviera.

246
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,249
- Do you like working for my father?
- Oh, I don't see much of him.

247
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,927
Mrs. Appleby uses the car most
of the time. He hardly ever goes out.

248
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,490
It's funny he didn't use you to drive
him. When he went away.

249
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,847
That's not the only thing.
He used the small car.

250
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,401
- What's funny about it?
- He doesn't like the small car.

251
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,324
- Maybe the other wasn't there.
- It was.

252
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,881
They were both in the garage
the night he left.

253
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,841
I wonder why he left at night.

254
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,526
Bob, would you take me back up
now, please?

255
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,684
Back to the house?

256
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,644
Summerhouse.

257
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,371
- What are you looking for?
- Something, anything.

258
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,087
I thought you agreed
it was just your imagination.

259
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,924
I did, but there must be something...

260
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,765
...that will tell me why my imagination
acted the way it did.

261
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,527
Like a dead body?
Oh, I'm sorry, Penny.

262
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,250
Penny!

263
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,202
Come into the house.
I've got a surprise for you.

264
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,125
- What is it?
- Come and see.

265
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,282
I'll take it, Robert.

266
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,283
- What kind of a surprise?
- Wait and see.

267
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,810
It's for you.

268
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,806
<i>- Hello?
- Penny, this is your father.</i>

269
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,641
<i>Penny, can you hear me?</i>

270
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,290
What's the matter, darling?

271
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,683
<i>- Penny?
- Yes.</i>

272
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,447
<i>Oh, I thought you'd gone.
Can you hear me all right?</i>

273
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,965
Yes.

274
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,930
<i>I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you arrived.</i>

275
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,128
<i>Jane told you I was away
on business?</i>

276
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,009
Yes.

277
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,768
<i>I'll be a couple more days yet.
Look after yourself and have fun.</i>

278
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,526
All right. Thank you.

279
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,411
<i>Let me speak to Jane, will you?</i>

280
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,089
Yes? Hello.

281
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,322
- Is <i>Penny</i> all right?
- Yes, she's fine.

282
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,644
<i>- Tell her I'll be back soon.
- Yes, I'll tell her.</i>

283
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,691
- Do you <i>miss</i> me?
- Yes. See you soon.

284
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,410
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

285
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,206
There. That makes you feel better
about last night, doesn't it?

286
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,122
Oh, Penny, I-- I shouldn't go to
the summerhouse again if I were you.

287
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,284
It was a horrible experience.
We don't want to repeat it, do we?

288
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,727
I can manage now, Jane.

289
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,768
Oh, darling, Dr. Gerrard is coming
to lunch. You don't mind, do you?

290
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,843
No, of course not.

291
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,760
- May I come in?
- Yes.

292
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,086
It's about what I said just now
in the summerhouse.

293
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,811
- Am I forgiven?
- Yes, of course.

294
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,486
- Well, what was the big surprise?
- My father.

295
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,768
He wanted to talk to me
on the phone.

296
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,003
- No more worries, then?
- I suppose not.

297
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,882
Shall I take you for another walk
this afternoon?

298
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,010
Dr. Gerrard's coming for lunch,
and he may stay the afternoon.

299
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,164
- Oh, then I'd better get dressed.
- Why? You have to go out?

300
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,482
Well, if he's coming,
I've got to go pick him up.

301
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,847
- Doesn't he have a car?
- He has, but it's in dock.

302
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,651
He smashed it up last week.
He's a terrible driver.

303
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,566
- Did you bring him out here last night?
- I was to, but--

304
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,371
No, I didn't.
I took him home, though.

305
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,410
- How did he get out, then?
- I don't know.

306
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,763
I was only unconscious 20 minutes,
wasn't I?

307
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,289
Yeah, about that. He just seemed to
be here. I didn't think anything of it.

308
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,851
- Was he here to dinner?
- No.

309
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,765
Anyway, if he had been,
you would have had to pick him up.

310
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,649
Yeah, that's funny.

311
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,329
I don't understand
what's happening here.

312
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,642
One minute I think I was imagining
everything...

313
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,326
...and the next
I'm just not sure anymore.

314
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,723
Even now that I've talked to my father,
I'm still not sure.

315
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,689
What, you mean it wasn't him?

316
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,969
I haven't talked to my father for nine
years. It could've been anyone.

317
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,728
- Why?
- I don't know. I just don't know.

318
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,120
Now I'll tell you something.

319
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,931
You said last night a candle
was burning in the summerhouse.

320
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,607
Everyone says, "Nonsense, there's an
electric light there, why use a candle?"

321
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,321
What is it?

322
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,802
I scraped it off the floor just now when
Mrs. Appleby brought you indoors.

323
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,883
It's candle grease.

324
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,810
No, thank you.

325
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,009
- You haven't eaten anything, Penny.
- I'm not hungry.

326
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,482
You really should try to eat something.
You're a little run-down, you know.

327
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,404
Why do you say that?

328
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,166
A reasonably healthy person
would never have experienced...

329
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,526
...what you did last night.

330
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,001
- You should be particularly careful.
- Why me?

331
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,643
Your father said that when you were
a child, you were over-imaginative...

332
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,246
...and inclined to be frightened
of your own shadow.

333
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,926
Then your accident,
and all those weeks in hospital...

334
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,449
...it's hardly surprising that your mind
is a little confused, is it?

335
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,888
You must be very careful. Shocks
such as the one you had last night...

336
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,883
...whether the cause is real
or imaginary...

337
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,441
...can deal the mind
a very serious blow.

338
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,807
A blow which could affect it
permanently.

339
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,726
You mean I could go mad?

340
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,881
I didn't mean to imply
anything as drastic as that.

341
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,485
What did you mean to imply?

342
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,883
Well, it's just that if the imagination
starts to wander...

343
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,691
...one has to try and drag it
back to reality before--

344
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,560
Before it becomes permanent,
you said, Dr. Gerrard.

345
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,570
- Pierre meant--
- I know what he meant.

346
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,087
He meant I'd better watch myself
or I'll go insane...

347
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,163
...and have to be locked up.

348
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,924
Bob?

349
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,283
- Miss Penny.
- Would you get that key down for me?

350
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,851
I can't. Mrs. Appleby's got it.

351
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,684
I thought it was kept
up on the ledge.

352
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,649
It was, but she asked for it
before lunch.

353
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,247
- Why?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.

354
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,488
That candle grease
you were telling me about--

355
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,086
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
It doesn't tell anything.

356
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,810
It helps prove what I was saying.

357
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,884
It proves a candle's been burned
in there. It could be months ago.

358
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,408
- The place is never used.
- I saw it last night.

359
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,604
Yes, miss. So you said.

360
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,127
You don't believe me either,
do you?

361
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,523
I believe you think
you saw something.

362
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,327
First Dr. Gerrard and Jane.
And now you.

363
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,768
Now, listen. Believe me, I'd like to
help, but can't see what I can do.

364
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,002
Robert? I'm ready, Robert.

365
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,686
Will you bring the car around
to the front?

366
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,123
Sure you don't want to come,
darling?

367
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,011
The drive will do you good.
Put colour in your cheeks.

368
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,764
No, thank you.

369
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,524
Can I bring you anything
from Cannes?

370
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,886
No.

371
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,450
All right.

372
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,167
I'll be back just after dark.

373
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,090
Come in.

374
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,441
If there is nothing else, mademoiselle,
I should like to go now.

375
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,490
- Oh, is Mrs. Appleby back yet?
- No.

376
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,689
Robert told me
she had shopping to do in Cannes.

377
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,684
They will not be back
until half an hour more, I think.

378
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,571
All right. Thank you.
Good night, Marie.

379
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,684
Bob?

380
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,405
Bob? Is that you?

381
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,805
Bob?

382
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,605
Father?

383
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,523
Bring the things in here, Robert.

384
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,968
Hello, darling. Why didn't you tell me
you wanted to use the sitting room?

385
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,407
Marie could have lit the fire.

386
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,689
Jane, who uses the piano?

387
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,487
Your father. Nobody else
in the house can play.

388
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,641
He keeps it locked.

389
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,009
He doesn't like people
tinkling with it, says it ruins the tone.

390
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,484
- What kind of car is the small car?
- What do you mean, darling?

391
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,529
The small one.
The one Father went away in.

392
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,728
It's a white Simca.

393
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,810
He's come back.
It's in the garage.

394
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,401
Miss Penny, I just--

395
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,166
That'll be all, thank you, Robert.
You can go.

396
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,808
I saw the car. It was in the garage.

397
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,440
We've just came from the garage.
There was no car there.

398
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,568
But I saw it. I was there
and I saw it.

399
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,963
- But you couldn't have. Otherwise--
- Leave me alone.

400
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,530
Penny.

401
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,810
Bob?

402
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,526
- There wasn't any car.
- There was a small white sports car.

403
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,411
How did I know my father
had that car if I didn't see it?

404
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,608
You didn't. I just told you
in the living room.

405
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,129
But I saw it, I tell you.
It was there. I heard it arrive.

406
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,923
And someone
started playing the piano.

407
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,091
- The piano is locked.
- I know, and there was no one there.

408
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,925
But someone was playing
that piano.

409
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,049
I know it doesn't
make any sense but--

410
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,521
Garage.
Yes, madam, she's here.

411
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,769
Yes, I'll tell her.

412
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,802
Mrs. Appleby asked me to tell you
that supper will be in half an hour.

413
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,851
Look, try not to worry too much.

414
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,571
There's bound to be a reasonable
explanation for all this.

415
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,041
We'll try and work something
out together, shall we?

416
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,680
Thank you. Good night, Bob.

417
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,684
Good night, Miss Penny.

418
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,011
Bob!

419
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,850
Bob!

420
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,009
Bob!

421
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,131
Bob!

422
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,329
Bob! He was there.

423
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,925
- Penny, what is it?
- In my room.

424
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,725
What is it?

425
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,481
What is all the noise?

426
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,803
Miss Penny. She came out screaming
about something in her room.

427
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,440
- Poor child. Where is she now?
- I'm here.

428
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,331
What happened, darling?
What frightened you?

429
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,211
I'm sorry. I thought I saw something.

430
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,761
But what? What did you see?

431
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,003
I seem to have caused
a lot of fuss about nothing.

432
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,642
- My imagination again.
- You frightened me to death.

433
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,407
- Are you sure you're all right now?
- It won't happen again.

434
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,803
I hope not, because your poor head
won't stand many more shocks.

435
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,964
Would you like me to bring your
dinner in here? Would you like that?

436
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,841
- I'll be all right now.
- Good.

437
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,290
Oh, Penny, I hope you don't mind,
I've asked Dr. Gerrard to dinner.

438
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,291
Why?

439
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,011
Well, I could put him off
if you'd rather.

440
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,611
Don't bother because of me.

441
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,804
That'll be all, thank you, Robert.

442
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,167
Well, good night, ma'am.
Miss Penny.

443
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,721
- Good night. I'm sorry if I--
- Don't mention it.

444
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,962
- Penny, you're sure you're all right?
- Please, I feel bad enough as it is.

445
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,691
- Don't make it any worse.
- No, of course not.

446
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,165
Well, I'll see you at dinner
in about 20 minutes.

447
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,524
Thank you.

448
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,327
Bob.
I was hoping you'd come back.

449
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,166
You weren't imagining things,
were you?

450
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,731
No.

451
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,488
Tell me what you saw.

452
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,124
My father.

453
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,369
He was sitting there, in that chair.

454
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,482
And he was dead.

455
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,211
And...

456
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,006
...he moved his head.
It was horrible.

457
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,323
You were outside the room?

458
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,370
I went to the summerhouse
to see alight.

459
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,091
The same light
that was there last night.

460
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,281
- That was very brave of you.
- I had to know what it was.

461
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,490
And when I was there,
I saw a light go off in here...

462
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,086
...so I came rushing back.

463
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,170
And, Bob,
he was sitting there waiting.

464
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,650
What is it?

465
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,601
It's wet. Soaking wet.

466
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,967
What does it mean, Bob?

467
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,646
Your father's a very rich man,
isn't he?

468
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,804
- Yes.
- Any idea what's in his will?

469
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,801
- How do you mean?
- If he dies, who gets the money?

470
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,691
- I do.
- All of it? What about Mrs. Appleby?

471
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,049
There's a trust fund.
She gets the interest.

472
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,282
Are you sure?
Could the will have been changed?

473
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,442
You haven't seen your father
for a long time.

474
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,365
It couldn't have been.
The money was my grandfather's...

475
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,488
...and he didn't approve
of second marriages.

476
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,926
Are there any conditions?

477
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,481
Well, if I'm dead or incapable,
Jane gets the money.

478
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,085
Incapable?

479
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,971
You know,
unable to handle the estates...

480
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,851
...legally incompetent, insane--

481
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,001
They want you out of the way before
it's discovered that your father's dead.

482
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,642
- That way you won't collect the money.
- Jane will.

483
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,400
Bob, that means
that they killed my father.

484
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,525
They may have, but not likely.

485
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,445
If they had, they'd have no qualms
about killing you too.

486
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,169
No, the trouble they're going to
to drive you insane...

487
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,608
...makes it look as though your
father's had an accident, perhaps...

488
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,001
...and all they're doing
is keeping quiet about it.

489
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,243
Then when they can get you out
of the way, they'll rig the accident...

490
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,927
-...so it looks as if it's just happened.
- What can we do?

491
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,243
We're only guessing. We'd better look
around for some sort of evidence.

492
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,890
But what?

493
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,523
It's not very pleasant, I know, but
somewhere here is your father's body.

494
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,569
We've got to find it.

495
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,927
Bob, I'm frightened.

496
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,441
I'll look around after your stepmother's
gone to bed.

497
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,329
I wanna go with you.

498
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,362
All right.
Look, draw your curtains when I go.

499
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,569
When she's gone to bed, open them
up again. I'll watch for the light.

500
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,245
Bob?

501
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,724
Thank you.

502
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,926
- Pierre?
- Thank you.

503
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,525
Penny?

504
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,890
- Penny--
- What do you want?

505
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,646
- Pierre only wants to help you, darling.
- Please, Jane.

506
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,201
If it's about my mental health,
I'd rather not hear it.

507
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,407
It's about your legs.

508
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,801
When was the last time
that you saw a specialist?

509
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,849
- Why?
- Tell me, please.

510
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,161
Three years ago.

511
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,490
Well, that's why I want you
to see another one now, in Zurich.

512
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,208
I have seen specialists
all over the world...

513
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,091
-...and they all said the same thing.
- Yes, I know.

514
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,129
But the last time
was three years ago.

515
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,047
Penny, do you know what is meant
by hysterical paralysis?

516
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,608
Well, it happens when,
because of a fright or an accident...

517
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,401
...a person can lose the use
of a muscle or a limb.

518
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,722
There is no tissue pathology
to account for this.

519
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,451
There are no physical symptoms
to account for this...

520
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,683
...but the fact is inescapable.
The person is completely unable to--

521
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,969
Well, for example, to walk.

522
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,931
The reasons for this are mental.
They're not physical.

523
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,289
There's no physical reason why this
person should not get straight up...

524
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,489
...out of her chair
and walk with the rest of us.

525
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,326
It's only this self-created mental block
that prevents her.

526
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,767
You're trying to tell me
that I'm not a cripple?

527
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,685
- That it's all in my mind?
- I'm saying that could be the case.

528
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,561
Was the horse that fell on me
in my mind too? Did I imagine that?

529
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,485
No. No, that was the basic cause,
I admit.

530
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,291
But since then the physical damage
could have been repaired.

531
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,886
It is only the mental side
that refuses to accept this.

532
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,362
That is why I'm, well, seriously
worried about your mental state.

533
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,007
After all, with all this confusion
going on...

534
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,640
...you can hardly expect your mind
to behave rationally.

535
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:13,806
Dr. Gerrard, I am a cripple.
My back was broken in two places.

536
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,441
If you want
the technical diagnosis...

537
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,888
...I sustained a multiple fracture
of the first lumbar vertebra...

538
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,283
...and a simple fracture
between the fifth and sixth cervical.

539
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,966
I can show you the x-rays
if you'd like.

540
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,205
But I didn't imagine it
and I'm not imagining it now.

541
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,842
Do you think that I like
being tied to this chair...

542
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,162
...dependent on anyone
who can spare me a moment?

543
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,050
Do you think that I like
not being able to--?

544
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,646
To dance and swim and ride...

545
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,444
...or just walk like anyone else?

546
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,930
I don't like it. I hate it.
I loathe and hate and despise it.

547
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,050
You say that my mind
is affecting my legs. You're wrong.

548
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,168
It's my legs that are affecting
my mind.

549
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,086
I'd rather not talk about it anymore.

550
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,608
- I think what Pierre meant, Penny--
- I said no more, Jane. I mean it.

551
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,285
- Is she in bed?
- She went up about 20 minutes ago...

552
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,240
...but I thought it'd be better
to wait a little longer.

553
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,927
- We've got the place to ourselves.
- Where are we going to look?

554
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,925
I've been thinking since we talked.

555
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,048
The weather's not very cold.

556
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,690
The body..

557
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,844
Well, I mean, it's not going to keep.

558
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,643
- There's only one place it could be.
- Where?

559
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,210
Deep freeze.

560
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,283
A week ago, Mrs. Appleby asked me
to fit a new lock on it.

561
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,930
Shall we go?

562
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,445
Okay?

563
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,451
Yes.

564
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,563
What will we do now?

565
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,609
- Keep looking.
- Where?

566
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,444
I don't know.

567
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,570
We can't do any more tonight.
I better take you back to your room.

568
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,088
- What about the lock?
- I'll fix it later.

569
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,651
I don't see why we just can't go
and tell them what we know.

570
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,848
But that's it, Penny.
We don't know anything.

571
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,288
We can't just march in and say your
father's met with a fatal accident...

572
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,250
...and your stepmother and
Dr. Gerrard are trying to conceal it.

573
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,970
- Why not?
- Because without proof...

574
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,363
...they wouldn't believe us.
No, we've got to find the body.

575
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,285
But where?
You yourself said that a body won't--

576
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,124
Won't keep. Where could it be?

577
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,602
Somewhere close to the house.
It has to be.

578
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,964
I'm not much help to you there.
I can't even get up the stairs.

579
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,363
It's how it should be. I don't want you
wandering. Anything might happen.

580
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,761
Leave it to me. I'll think of something.
I'll get you back to the house for lunch.

581
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,161
Why are you doing all this for me,
Bob?

582
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,086
I don't like to see anybody get
the sharp end of the stick.

583
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,564
I liked your father. I don't like your
stepmother or that Gerrard character.

584
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,484
Because you're pretty.

585
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,807
It's not sympathy?

586
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,964
Sure, there's sympathy there.
But not for the reasons you think.

587
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,647
You're a nice person who's in trouble.
I sympathize with you for that.

588
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,723
Not because of these?

589
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,361
Like I told you before, it's hard luck.

590
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,921
There's plenty of people
worse off than you are.

591
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,526
There's another reason too.
Shall I tell you what it is?

592
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,607
I didn't mean to do that
until all this was over.

593
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,842
I'm glad you did.

594
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,203
Hey, if I keep you out any longer,
I shall be looking for a new job.

595
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,724
Penny, you're not getting
too friendly with Robert, are you?

596
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,881
Too friendly?

597
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,849
Well, I've been watching you
when you're together, and you seem...

598
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,651
Cheerful is the word, Jane.

599
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:06,806
We want you to be happy, darling,
don't misunderstand. But not Robert.

600
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,005
How would you like me to give a party
and ask the local people?

601
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,731
- Like Dr. Gerrard?
- Don't you like him?

602
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,247
- Not especially.
- Well, you must talk to your father.

603
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,767
Because he's his friend, not mine.

604
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,448
No, I was thinking of Monsieur Gaston.
He lives on the other side of the bay.

605
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,922
He has two sons about your age.
Then there's John Blakeman--

606
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,048
Please, Jane, thank you,
but I'd rather not.

607
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,684
All right, Penny.

608
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,762
I know it can't be much fun
for you at the moment, darling.

609
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,645
But in the summer, it's lovely here.

610
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,724
We might get the pool cleaned out,
and then perhaps you could swim.

611
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,640
Madame Latour, madame.

612
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,731
My dressmaker. I should have
seen her in Cannes this morning.

613
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,564
I won't be long.

614
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,407
- What's the matter, Penny?
- Matter? Nothing.

615
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,006
You looked strange for a moment.

616
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,410
I've got to go out this afternoon.
I won't be back till 10 tonight.

617
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,086
- Will you be all right?
- I'd rather not be alone.

618
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,641
No, of course not.
I'll ask Marie if she can stay.

619
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,964
Don't bother. If I know that Robert's
in his room, I won't be worried.

620
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,163
I can drive myself.

621
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,646
Are you sure you want to?

622
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,883
Oh, it's just the cold.

623
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,284
Let's get it over with.

624
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,929
Well, here we go.

625
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,290
Anything?

626
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,123
No, it's black as pitch down there.

627
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,601
Maybe it would be better if--

628
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,441
He's there, isn't he?

629
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,289
What shall we do?

630
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,451
- Go to the police.
- Now?

631
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,809
Well, there's no point in waiting.
We've found what we were looking for.

632
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,724
- What about--?
- We must leave him there.

633
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,962
We'll fetch the police back
and show them.

634
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,406
I'll come with you.

635
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,246
Okay. I'll go and get dressed,
and meet you around the front.

636
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,004
Can you manage?

637
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,130
Five minutes.

638
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:07,766
- You don't want your chair, do you?
- No, I suppose not.

639
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,805
What if they find the chair?

640
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,890
It doesn't really matter, does it? Once
we get back, nothing matters anymore.

641
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,807
How long will it take to get there?

642
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,567
It's no good going to the village police
station. The old chap there's useless.

643
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,849
We'll go straight through to Cannes.
It'll only take us half an hour.

644
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,684
- It will all be over soon, Penny.
- I was thinking about my father.

645
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:57,207
I never knew him really, not as a
daughter, but I know that he was kind.

646
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,443
Even after Mother divorced him,
he was always doing things for her.

647
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,489
Little things, like--

648
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,526
He always remembered
my birthday.

649
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,490
How could this have happened, Bob?
How?

650
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,563
- Greed.
- She was his wife.

651
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,202
She must have loved him once.
Can it die so completely?

652
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,650
Not die, no. But it can be killed by--
By another love. By somebody else.

653
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,245
Dr. Gerrard.

654
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,881
I suppose so.

655
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,921
What's that?

656
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,761
- It's your stepmother.
- Don't stop. I'm frightened.

657
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,606
She'll recognise the car. I'll have to
stop. You sit tight. I'll speak to her.

658
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,685
Will she be dead?

659
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,640
She's a cripple, isn't she?
She's dead.

660
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,051
It worked, Bob. It worked.

661
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,124
The accident will be discovered.
There will be a coroner's inquest.

662
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,887
- But it will be all right?
- Yes, it'll be all right.

663
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,008
Turn it off, Bob, please.

664
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,845
I rather like it.
It makes a good requiem.

665
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,289
Please, Bob.

666
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,250
To us.

667
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,284
What's the matter?

668
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,803
Having to kill her.

669
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,964
But we agreed we'd have to
if it didn't work the other way.

670
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,764
If only we could have done it
without killing.

671
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,968
I thought
when her father had the accident...

672
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,202
...everything would be all right.

673
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,171
It seemed that things...

674
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,882
Well, what is it, Bob?
Why are you smiling?

675
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,010
You never believed your husband
had an accident, did you?

676
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,651
- Did you?
- Bob, don't.

677
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,043
- Did you?
- Don't, Bob. Don't.

678
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,481
The old man could swim like a fish,
and you know it.

679
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,084
Do you know what I did?

680
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,244
I dragged him under
and I held him there.

681
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,482
- Bob, don't.
- I watched his stupid face...

682
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,166
-...while he tried to hold his breath.
- Please, don't.

683
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,006
Then there were a lot of bubbles.
And he stopped struggling.

684
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,722
Your telephone call
reached me this morning...

685
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,167
...at the same time as this report.

686
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,163
A break in the cliff fence.

687
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,483
An automobile upside down
in 30 feet of water.

688
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:10,406
It is likely that the two things
are the same. I am sorry.

689
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,011
Your stepdaughter had not been
with you long, I understand.

690
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,607
Four days.

691
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,684
- And Monsieur Appleby?
- He arrived home last night.

692
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,330
They went for a drive together...

693
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,131
...because they wanted to
get to know one another again.

694
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,763
They hadn't seen each other
for 10 years. I was an outsider, really.

695
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,491
It must have been difficult for you.

696
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:36,124
It was, a bit. But it would have been
all right. I know it would. And now this.

697
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,443
You have my deepest sympathies,
Mrs. Appleby.

698
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,645
You will be at the house
if we want you?

699
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,487
- Want me?
- The bodies will have to be identified.

700
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,725
- Oh, do I have to?
- I'm afraid so. It's the law.

701
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,447
Your husband's solicitor
has been informed.

702
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,523
He will be coming from London
this morning.

703
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,170
He will go straight to the house.

704
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:05,529
No doubt there will be
a number of things to attend to.

705
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,768
Your husband was rich, wasn't he?

706
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,890
- I suppose so.
- And now everything comes to you.

707
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,922
I believe so.
It would have gone to Penny.

708
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,801
Quite so.

709
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,926
You'll ask the solicitor
to contact me?

710
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,527
Yes, I will. Thank you, inspector.
You've been very kind.

711
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,921
I will arrange for a car
to take you home.

712
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,605
Mrs. Appleby has her own car.

713
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:33,761
I know. But I'd like you to accompany
me to the scene of the accident.

714
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,763
We'll need you to identify
the automobile.

715
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,361
- It's all right, Robert.
- Well, if you say so, ma'am.

716
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,330
- Goodbye, inspector.
- Good day, Mrs. Appleby.

717
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,689
- I'll wait for you outside, inspector.
- Thank you.

718
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,204
You can identify the automobile
from here?

719
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,442
Well, hardly, inspector.

720
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,451
Of course not.

721
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,364
The frogman will attempt
to ascertain...

722
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,490
...the colour, the make
and the number of the car.

723
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,563
Then we will know.

724
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,446
I shall go down
to talk with the frogman.

725
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,685
Oh, there's plenty of time.
You will wait here, please.

726
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,640
You have my deepest sympathy,
Mrs. Appleby.

727
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,041
- Such a tragedy.
- Thank you, Mr. Spratt.

728
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,441
I've tried to keep the papers
down to a minimum.

729
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,409
You must understand
that in such cases...

730
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:20,404
...there is an amount of legal
work which must be taken care of.

731
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,881
- Yes, of course.
- Before anything becomes official...

732
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,088
...we must wait
for the verdict of the coroner.

733
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:29,882
But if in the meantime there's anything
that you require, please let me know.

734
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,722
Your husband's will is most clear
and explicit.

735
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,484
Everything he has is to go to you...

736
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,371
...with no attachments
or codicil whatsoever.

737
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,568
Now if you'll please just sign...

738
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,008
...on the papers
where I have left a cross in pencil.

739
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:47,165
The will allows you to draw money
from the estate pending settlement.

740
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,448
There's just one thing, Mr. Spratt.

741
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,446
I understand in a case of common
accident when both parties die...

742
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,729
...there's sometimes a dispute
as to who legally was the first to die.

743
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,441
That's quite so. But I fail to see that it
has any bearing on the matter in hand.

744
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,764
- Well, this was a common accident.
- What was?

745
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,728
Both my husband and my
stepdaughter were in the car together.

746
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,201
Your stepdaughter, Miss Penelope?

747
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,522
Oh, didn't they tell you?
I thought the police--

748
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,160
I'm sorry, Mrs. Appleby.
I just don't understand you.

749
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,606
Well, both my husband and Penny
were in the car. They--

750
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,966
They were killed together.

751
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,451
No, that's quite impossible.

752
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,326
I don't know why you say that,
Mr. Spratt. It's a fact.

753
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,371
- They went for a drive and--
- Mrs. Appleby, surely you must know.

754
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,648
Your stepdaughter,
Miss Penelope Appleby...

755
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,566
...committed suicide three weeks ago
in Switzerland.

756
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,889
Are you all right, Mrs. Appleby?
Can I get you anything?

757
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,089
- Mrs. Appleby?
- I'm sorry.

758
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,130
Obviously your husband
didn't tell you.

759
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:56,410
His daughter went for a holiday
with her companion, a Miss Frensham.

760
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,164
She drowned herself, apparently.

761
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,166
She was always
of a delicate mental state.

762
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,449
It was due to her paralysis,
I understand.

763
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,649
Really, you must allow me
to get you some brandy.

764
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,970
Come down here a moment, please.

765
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,446
My apologies for asking you
to come down all this way.

766
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,489
It was easier than for me to go up.

767
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,802
We'd only have to come down again
immediately.

768
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,962
Climbing I do not find agreeable.

769
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,687
- Is it the car?
- It is a Rolls-Royce, silver and black...

770
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,562
...with the number 278EMO6.

771
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,567
- Is it the car?
- Yeah, that's it.

772
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,449
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

773
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,890
Strange.
There's only one person inside.

774
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,961
- A man.
- The girl? The daughter?

775
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,842
Of her, I'm afraid, there's no sign.

776
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,639
I shall have to leave you now,
Mrs. Appleby.

777
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,211
I must report to the local police
for news of the recovery.

778
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,443
Yes, of course.

779
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,241
Are you quite sure
you're all right?

780
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,690
- I'm all right, thank you.
- I shall show myself out.

781
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,481
Is your friend quite safe out there?

782
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,404
Friend?

783
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,804
The young lad)'-

784
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,007
Good day, Mrs. Appleby.

785
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,930
Good morning, Jane.

786
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,051
Why so silent?

787
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,925
- Who are you?
- Maggie Frensham.

788
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,131
Frensham? The companion.

789
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,602
That's right. Penny's friend.

790
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,604
But I don't understand.

791
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,367
I spent three years watching
Penny die, Mrs. Appleby.

792
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,127
Little by little. When her mother died,
she was all alone.

793
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,362
For a girl like Penny,
that was unbearable.

794
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,809
Finally I couldn't stand it any longer,
so I wrote to her father.

795
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,803
- You wrote to him here?
- Yes.

796
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,526
He answered. He said that she
couldn't come here then...

797
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,603
...because something strange
was happening.

798
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,205
But he didn't say anything to me.

799
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,727
He'd hardly have told you,
Mrs. Appleby.

800
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,644
It was you
that he was disturbed about.

801
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,204
Penny finally stopped struggling
against life.

802
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:09,445
She slipped out of the cabin one night
and drowned herself.

803
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,648
Two weeks later,
I opened a letter that arrived for her.

804
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,723
"Please come home, Penny.

805
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,680
I have always wanted you here.
Signed, Father."

806
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,651
Penny was dead, Mrs. Appleby.
And her father knew it.

807
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,245
But how did he know?

808
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,847
I told him myself. I spoke to him on
the phone the night that Penny died.

809
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,240
You spoke to him here?

810
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,165
Yes. That's when he told me
about his friend.

811
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,765
What friend? Who?

812
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,400
Can't you guess, Mrs. Appleby?

813
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,369
- Pierre.
- That's right. Dr. Gerrard.

814
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,962
Then when this letter arrived
with your husband's signature on it...

815
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:52,045
...I knew something must be wrong
because he knew Penny was dead.

816
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,727
So I contacted Dr. Gerrard,
and he and I decided what to do.

817
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,849
- You're not crippled.
- No.

818
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,162
I'm not.
That's why I'm still here.

819
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,846
I opened the car door last night
and jumped out.

820
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,129
It was Robert. He told me to--

821
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,884
- What are you doing to do?
- Need you ask that, Mrs. Appleby?

822
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,121
Is it money?

823
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,807
No, no, I don't want money.
I have more than enough.

824
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,123
Penny and I were very close.
She left me well provided for.

825
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,248
- Are you Robert, the chauffeur?
- Yes, sir.

826
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,482
I'm Spratt, Mr. Appleby's solicitor.

827
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,847
I've left Mrs. Appleby.
She's not feeling well.

828
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,402
Keep an eye on her. There doesn't
seem to be anyone except the girl.

829
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,769
- The girl?
- The cripple in the wheelchair.

830
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,651
I'll be at the Grand Hotel
if anyone wants me.

831
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,802
Please, isn't there anything--?

832
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,487
There's nothing, Mrs. Appleby.

833
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,125
On, Bob.

834
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,006
Bob!

835
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:53,211
Monsieur Robert,
will you come with me, please?

836
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,924
Come away, Maggie.

837
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,447
There's nothing more for you here.
