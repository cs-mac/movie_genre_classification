1
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,080
<i>I hope everybody's
ready to go out.</i>

2
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,786
<i>Have a good time tonight.</i>

3
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:59,748
<i>It's 8:00 pm, Saturday evening,
and it's still a hot one...</i>

4
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:10,938
Detail, attention!

5
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:16,109
Present arms!

6
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,320
ID, please.

7
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,500
You're Sergeant White.

8
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,000
Please proceed.

9
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,430
I believe I will.
Thank you kindly.

10
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,280
Troops, attention!

11
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,189
Now I give you a great general,
a great friend...

12
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:47,859
"Fighting" Joe Campbell.

13
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,747
At ease.

14
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,800
Thank you all.

15
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,440
As you know, my official
retirement isn't until next week.

16
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:18,554
But this here, now,
tonight, with you...

17
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,080
...is my real retirement.

18
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
Because you and I have
known fear together.

19
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,603
Shed blood together.
Battled pain and suffering,

20
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:30,356
and all of their foot soldiers.

21
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:34,200
We know there is no
glamour in a sudden death,

22
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,945
and that no one
ever wins a war.

23
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:40,120
And it is that knowledge that
will bind us together forever.

24
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,411
That, and a love for this country
that no bayonet can pierce,

25
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:48,247
no bullet shatter.

26
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,250
To you.

27
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,000
Hooah!

28
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,520
Sergeant White here.

29
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,760
It's Colonel Kent, Brenner.

30
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,983
So you can drop the
cheesy Southern accent.

31
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:21,736
Hey, the only thing keeping me alive
is that cheesy Southern accent.

32
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:24,560
Look, I was just checking up on
my favorite my guest detective.

33
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,200
How you doin'?

34
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Oh well, you know Bill.
I just love being undercover.

35
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,660
It's great.

36
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,240
I spent the last two weeks
smoking cheap cigars

37
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,914
and sweating my ass
off in that shitty houseboat.

38
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:35,880
Well, if you got any sort of time frame?

39
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,240
Yeah, I'm meeting Billing
tonight in the armory.

40
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,440
Then I'll arrest him on Sunday
when we make the exchange.

41
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,296
Then I'm going
back to Virginia.

42
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:44,150
Yeah, right. Well good
enough. Watch your back.

43
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,760
Thank you. I believe I will.

44
00:05:54,265 --> 00:05:56,142
Oh, man...

45
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
Out of gas?

46
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:20,880
Yeah.

47
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,680
That's why I'm
looking at a flat tire

48
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,440
with a pair of pliers in my hands
instead of a lug wrench...

49
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:33,480
"Uh-oh, she's a captain".

50
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Uh-oh, she's a captain.

51
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:39,932
This looks like the work
of ten chimpanzees.

52
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,880
Well, you just missed
the other nine.

53
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,200
They got bored.
Went for a beer.

54
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:46,280
I have a lug
wrench, can I try?

55
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,810
Well, if you don't, I'm
gonna drag you over.

56
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:10,835
Get the spare.
- Yes, ma'am.

57
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Golly dang.

58
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,600
If you like pina coladas
and getting caught in the rain,

59
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,977
I will just have to
marry you, Captain.

60
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:33,440
You'll have to
take this in.

61
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,960
The spare's just a temp tire.

62
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,120
Won't be good for more
than thirty miles or so.

63
00:07:39,361 --> 00:07:43,040
Where would if a fella got courageous
and wanted to send you,

64
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,880
a "thank you" notion,
a bob or a basket of fruit,

65
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,786
where might one
wanna find you?

66
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:49,320
Psy Ops.

67
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,164
How's that?

68
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:56,210
Psychological Operations.
I teach there.

69
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,546
What do you teach?

70
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:02,200
Mostly we fuck with
people's minds.

71
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,432
Damn...

72
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:32,284
There you go.
Genuine and made in the USA.

73
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:35,440
All you gotta do is give Dalbert
and me 100,000 each,

74
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,498
and you'll see them
guns on Sunday.

75
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:39,680
You'll get your money.

76
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,040
In time
I get the guns.

77
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:44,600
Now, you listen
to me, funny boy.

78
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,257
How do I know you're ain't
one of 'em, 'em Army cops?

79
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:49,760
Hey, I'm a freedom fighter.

80
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,800
Well, check it out Dalbert.
What'd I tell ya.

81
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,440
We got ourselves
Che fucking Guevara there.

82
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:00,268
What to do.
A freedom fighter!

83
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:03,640
Where's your
kooky red hat, boy?

84
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,880
Ain't never been a
freedom fighter worth it

85
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,920
if God ain't got him
a kooky red hat.

86
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,280
You listen to
me, stupid. . .

87
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,720
Dalbert, I think it's
one of 'em Freudian...

88
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,440
Hey, Dal-- Dalbert!

89
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,740
What?

90
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,880
You wanna hear a joke?

91
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,000
No!

92
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:28,085
How many of them freedom fighters
does it take to screw in a light bulb?

93
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,640
I don't know.

94
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,796
Hey, come on, man.
Relax, huh.

95
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:34,200
Well, he don't sound like
no criminal investigator to me.

96
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,000
No!

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,500
- No?

98
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,500
No!

99
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,640
Well, you're
all right, pal.

100
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm sorry about
what happened.

101
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:43,040
You know, we get a little jumpy
around here before an exchange.

102
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,936
So, we'll see
you Sunday then.

103
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:48,760
I'll be there.

104
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,840
Yeah, you'll be there.

105
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,340
All right.

106
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:58,696
Oh, unclench your ass cheeks,
Dalbert, the scary part is over.

107
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,814
Don't tell me. You
need your oil changed?

108
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:42,652
Nope. This is a token
of my appreciation.

109
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:50,360
These are strange chocolates.

110
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,680
They're bath products.

111
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,164
Bath products.
- Bath products?

112
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,000
Should I take a hint?

113
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,800
No. Of course not.

114
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,320
Bath products.
Everybody likes bath products.

115
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:04,600
Do you?

116
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,680
Yes, I do.

117
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,480
Well like, tell me what
you like about bath products.

118
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,638
I like the pink soaps.

119
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,760
and I like...

120
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,680
the skin softener,

121
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,480
and I like the bath beads.
Particularly like the bath beads.

122
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,680
Sometimes I draw a tub...

123
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,080
and then, ah, fill that tub with
skin softeners and bath beads,

124
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,480
Light a few candles.

125
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,160
Put on Coltrane...

126
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,720
Soak my troubles away...

127
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:34,520
Very good, First Sergeant.

128
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,040
I levied a non-two set
accusation of sexism at you.

129
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,498
And you took it three times
around the dance floor.

130
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:46,752
Not really.
I just dig bath beads.

131
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:50,506
Well, thank you.
Maybe I'll see you around.

132
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:52,760
Am I being dismissed?

133
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
Do you mind, terribly?
I have a ton of work here.

134
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,880
No.

135
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
I just came by
to give you that.

136
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,600
Thank you. You're sweet.

137
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,960
How's the tire?

138
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,200
Still rolling, ma'am.

139
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,840
I'm glad.

140
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:18,114
Goodbye, First Sergeant.
- Goodbye, Captain.

141
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,440
<i>Having announced
his retirement,</i>

142
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,120
<i>Gen. Joseph Campbell is being
considered for the vice presidency.</i>

143
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,800
<i>Sources close to presidential
candidate Bill Post tell us</i>

144
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,960
<i>he's poised to select General
Joseph Campbell as his running mate.</i>

145
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,720
<i>Earlier this year, the General gave the
commencement address at West Point.</i>

146
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:22,080
<i>While it was meant to be
a non-partisan appearance,</i>

147
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,280
<i>it certainly played
like a stump speech.</i>

148
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:28,761
<i>Leading this country,
that is your destiny.</i>

149
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,760
<i>We'll be back for more in a moment.</i>

150
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,679
Get way over to that car, okay.

151
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:29,271
And take it into the door.

152
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,324
Backing out.

153
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:47,120
Snagged.

154
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,840
- On what?

155
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:49,640
I don't know.

156
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Let's take a look.

157
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Paul Brenner!

158
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,520
Phone call for Paul Brenner.

159
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,439
What'd you say your name is?
- Frank White.

160
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:16,930
Brenner!

161
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,320
- You military?
- Yes, sir. I am.

162
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,820
Paul Brenner!

163
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,720
I'm a sergeant
at the post armory.

164
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:24,400
CID Agent Brenner!

165
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,000
...and locked out. The next thing I know,
you know, he's blasting away.

166
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,680
Oh, you military boys got stories more
full of holes than a target range.

167
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,160
Sorry, Pop.

168
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,760
It's Col. Kent at the base.

169
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,560
Is there a Brenner here?
- No.

170
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:37,960
I'm Brenner.

171
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,160
Thought you was White?

172
00:18:40,378 --> 00:18:43,631
I'm both.
Skunked you, Chief Yardley.

173
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,800
Hey Bill.

174
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,120
No, man. It's over.
Billing's dead.

175
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,160
Okay. All right,
I'll see you there.

176
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,660
Thanks.

177
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,480
Hold on soldier boy.

178
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,561
I want you to tell me
about this Mr. Billings.

179
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,960
Soldier boy?

180
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,580
Okay, Chiefy,

181
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,440
if you have to know.

182
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,240
I was planning to arrest
him in the morning,

183
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,820
during weapons exchange.

184
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,270
But I guess he got wind

185
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,840
that I was part of the
Criminal Investigation Division.

186
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,540
See ya.

187
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,560
Good morning, sir. Where to?
- Urban Warfare site.

188
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,220
You have business there, sir?
- Yes, I do.

189
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,950
Very good, sir.

190
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:47,880
Hey, Bill.
- Hello, Paul.

191
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:54,320
What have we got here?

192
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,440
Tortured...

193
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,600
Raped...

194
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
And murdered.

195
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,450
Who found the body?

196
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,360
A bomb squad crew
doing exercises.

197
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,440
They called the tower.

198
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,360
Tower called me.

199
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,720
First on scene
was a PFC Robbins.

200
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,440
Is he a suspect?

201
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,240
- She. So I sincerely doubt it.

202
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,200
I have six of my boys securing
the scene. Nothing's been touched.

203
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,560
Oh, no...

204
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What is it, Paul?

205
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,560
I met her the other day.

206
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,280
Damn...

207
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
What a shame.

208
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:03,520
Lovely. Lovely lady.

209
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:08,040
All right, let's see.
We got...

210
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
We got some rigor here.

211
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:17,880
Petechial haemorrhaging,
which is consistent with asphyxia.

212
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,320
Strangulation, you think?

213
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:25,360
I'm assuming that,
but there's no tear in the panties,

214
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,920
and no obvious sign of semen.

215
00:21:30,741 --> 00:21:32,784
Is that hers?
- Yeah.

216
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,840
Why is she here?

217
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,440
HQ called her.

218
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:49,360
She's a rape counselor.
Name is Sarah Sunhill.

219
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,400
The victim doesn't need
counseling, Bill. She's dead.

220
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,960
Yes, but she's also a rape investigator.
She was on her way to an assignment.

221
00:21:57,557 --> 00:22:00,840
She agreed to stay on for this.
- Aren't we lucky?

222
00:22:05,564 --> 00:22:07,560
Get Forensics up
here from Fort Gillem.

223
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,840
Talk to Cal Seaver,
he's a guy I worked with.

224
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Get a fifty-yard grid
around the body.

225
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,600
Make resin casts of
all the boot prints.

226
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Let's see who was here and when

227
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,783
including these fall fine prints of you and hers.

228
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:17,880
We also need records.

229
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,203
Of Capt. Campbell's personal
and medical records, ASAP.

230
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:22,560
I already did that.

231
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,780
Thank you.

232
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,960
You're welcome.

233
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,120
Ah, Sarah Sunhill, Paul Brenner.

234
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,640
Also, I want you to book a Sergeant
Dalbert Elkins at the armory.

235
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,840
He's the one who started the
arms deal I was working on.

236
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,480
She walked barefoot from
here to where she died.

237
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,400
Why do you assume that?

238
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,600
There's smudge marks on her heels
and the asphalt. Where did she live?

239
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,200
Victory Gardens?
- Where's that?

240
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,800
I believe that's off-post.

241
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Yeah, well I
have to go there.

242
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,320
I'll call the Burford Police chief, I'll get a
court order and meet us out there.

243
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,080
No, that's Yardley.
I don't work with him.

244
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,520
Let's keep it within
the family, okay?

245
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,400
Whatnot, you can't
search her off-post house

246
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,280
without getting a
civilian search warrant.

247
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,120
Oh c'mon, Bill.

248
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:04,800
You need civilian authority.

249
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Somethin' I forgot, protect Paul Brenner from himself.

250
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,120
Does she have
family here?

251
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,140
Of course.

252
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,160
I suggest you notify them right away.

253
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,120
Detail, Attention!

254
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Present arms!

255
00:23:23,593 --> 00:23:25,840
You're kidding, right?

256
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,680
Kidding about what?

257
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:31,160
Elisabeth Campbell, Paul.
She's his kid.

258
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,400
Oh, no.

259
00:23:34,228 --> 00:23:37,397
I thought you knew.
- No, I didn't.

260
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:41,818
The General's daughter.
- Yeah.

261
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,120
What are you doing?

262
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,600
I feel queasy.

263
00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:02,560
Well, hop on,
I'll burp you.

264
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,920
Drive the car, Paul.

265
00:24:06,132 --> 00:24:07,840
I thought you said
you were queasy.

266
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,800
Drive the car, Paul.

267
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,260
Now, look.

268
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,040
I think I can help you on this one,
but I don't want it to be awkward.

269
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,440
Awkward? Now, why would
you think it would be awkward?

270
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,520
You're pouting.

271
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,840
This is not pouting.

272
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,310
Okay.

273
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,600
Sulky petulance, then.
- Wrong again.

274
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,160
This is just thinking
about Brussels, you know.

275
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,920
We'll always have Brussels.

276
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,760
Where?
- The capital of Belgium.

277
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:40,620
Why?

278
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:45,000
Why is it the capital,
or why will we always have it?

279
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,880
Why was she murdered?

280
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,800
Well, possible motives for murder.

281
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,400
Profit, revenge, jealousy, conceal a crime,
to avoid humiliation and disgrace,

282
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,520
- or plain old homicidal mania.
Right there in the manual.

283
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,520
Oh, boy...
- Yup.

284
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:37,040
Hello, we're here
to see the General.

285
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,440
Warrant Officer Paul Brenner, Sarah Sunhill.

286
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,320
Oh yes. I'm Captain Elby,
the General's aide.

287
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,920
Colonel Fowler, the General's
adjutant, will take you in.

288
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,480
Please wait right here.

289
00:25:50,727 --> 00:25:51,600
He's cute.

290
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, please...

291
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,024
He probably practises his salute
in the mirror for an hour...

292
00:25:57,274 --> 00:26:01,778
Please, come in, and
thank you for coming.

293
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:14,373
General, the CID
investigators are here.

294
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:19,044
Warrant Officers
Paul Brenner and Sarah Sunhill, sir.

295
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:24,382
Our deepest condolences, sir.
- Very sorry for your loss, sir.

296
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:25,600
Thank you.

297
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,680
Please be seated.

298
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:36,930
First,

299
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,565
I want you to know that you
have my full cooperation,

300
00:26:41,815 --> 00:26:44,040
and the cooperation of
everyone on this base.

301
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,400
Thank you, sir.

302
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:47,840
You understand the time element?

303
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,960
The time element?
No, sir.

304
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:54,493
After thirty-six hours, the FBI will
send in a task force to investigate.

305
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,200
But, we prefer to keep
this an Army matter.

306
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,290
The General can keep a lid
on it through tomorrow.

307
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,240
Once the FBI moves in, the
media will be all over this base.

308
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,720
And my daughter's...

309
00:27:08,214 --> 00:27:10,280
Captain Campbell's death...

310
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,595
They'll turn it into
a goddamn circus.

311
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:16,680
We'll do everything
we can, sir.

312
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,040
I'm sure you will.

313
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,360
Look, let me be blunt.

314
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,106
You're going to have to
decide on this one, Paul.

315
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,160
Are you a soldier?

316
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,401
Or a policeman?

317
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,080
I'm a soldier, sir.

318
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,880
I'm counting on it.

319
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,070
Sir, I met your daughter.

320
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,082
Really? When was that?

321
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,040
Well, ah, it was just a
coincidence. But, ah...

322
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,400
She helped me change a tire.

323
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,560
That, she could do.

324
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,320
She could do almost anything.

325
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,680
Her mother was the same way.

326
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Fix a tire, bake a hell
of a Key Lime pie.

327
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,560
Speak five languages.
Extraordinary woman.

328
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:11,200
Two extraordinary women.

329
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,400
Goddamn waste.

330
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,640
Again, our deepest sympathies, sir.

331
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,300
And if there's anything else
we can do for you at this time...

332
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:30,760
Just...

333
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,760
Just find the
son of a bitch.

334
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,240
Yes, sir.

335
00:28:45,052 --> 00:28:45,360
Sir...

336
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,000
When I enlisted
I was underage.

337
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,480
They sent me straight to Vietnam.

338
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,960
And you were
my commander.

339
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,520
You were a captain.

340
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:00,960
And I, I was so scared.

341
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:04,560
And one day,
when I was on watch,

342
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,520
You came by, and,
and you saw the fear.

343
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,860
You said that,
"Where are you from?"

344
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,640
And I said, "Boston".

345
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,039
You said, "Did you know that
last night the Boston Red Sox won,

346
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:21,400
against the St. Louis Cardinals
in the sixth game of the series?"

347
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,840
And then you
just walked away.

348
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:30,635
Well I knew, I knew then that
I was gonna get through it.

349
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:37,391
Boston lost that series.
- Yes, but I made it home.

350
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:42,360
We'll find the
son of a bitch, sir.

351
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:58,040
Mr Brenner...

352
00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:05,800
I understand you have
special arrest powers,

353
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,200
Yes, sir.

354
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:10,400
But I'm going to ask
before you arrest anyone,

355
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,480
you notify me.

356
00:30:12,923 --> 00:30:13,960
Why is that, sir?

357
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:21,181
We don't like our personnel arrested
by outside people without our knowing.

358
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:23,240
There are three ways
of doing things:

359
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:28,600
The right way, the wrong way
and the Army way.

360
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:34,760
See that, in doing it your way, Mr. Brenner,
you don't forget about the Army way.

361
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,200
<i>Our job here at Psy Ops
is to panic the enemy. </i>

362
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,680
<i>To blunt his will to fight.</i>

363
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,520
<i>A psy-operator must know the
customs and habits of the enemy,</i>

364
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,320
<i>their current dissentions, anxieties
and fears, to determine vulnerability.</i>

365
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:16,040
<i>To engage the enemy, you
must know the enemy inside out.</i>

366
00:31:16,564 --> 00:31:18,200
<i>You must fill him with fear.</i>

367
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,720
<i>And not just fear of dying.</i>

368
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:24,400
<i>Fear of grotesque wounds
is much more terrifying.</i>

369
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:26,880
"Grotesque wounds".

370
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:31,000
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

371
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,240
May I help you?

372
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,480
Might I ask what you are doing
in Captain Campbell's office?

373
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,120
That depends on who you are.

374
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,040
Too comfortably ensconced
in her office, I might add.

375
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Colonel Robert Moore.

376
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,150
Captain Campbell's commanding
officer here at Psy Ops.

377
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,150
And you are?

378
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,400
We're from the
Criminal Investigation Division.

379
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,920
Warrant Officers
Sunhill and Brenner.

380
00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,560
And you're investigating?

381
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,040
The murder of Captain Campbell.

382
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,880
And now that we
know who you are,

383
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,400
we'll need to
speak to you, Colonel.

384
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:14,120
I just have a...

385
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,520
I have a meeting...

386
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,582
Something tells me, we can file
Colonel Moore under "last to know".

387
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:27,080
Are you married?

388
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,640
None of your business.

389
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:29,840
Right...

390
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,160
Well, she wasn't a hypochondriac,
she didn't dye her hair,

391
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,475
she didn't have oily skin.

392
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:45,103
And she keeps her method
of birth control somewhere else.

393
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:48,481
Or perhaps she required
her men to wear condoms.

394
00:32:48,731 --> 00:32:52,560
Maybe you've heard that condoms are
in fashion again because of disease?

395
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:56,800
Nowadays you have to boil people
before you can sleep with them.

396
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,040
Care for a bath?

397
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,400
Oh, my...

398
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,414
This was one squared-away soldier.

399
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:11,600
Equally prepared for a military ball
or the next war in the jungle.

400
00:33:17,674 --> 00:33:20,840
<i>Liz, hi. Now, pick up.
It's Robert.</i>

401
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:24,600
<i>I haven't heard from you,
so call me, please.</i>

402
00:33:25,932 --> 00:33:29,200
Robert.
Surprise, surprise...

403
00:33:44,574 --> 00:33:45,280
Paul.

404
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:47,600
Move aside.

405
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,720
Man with a gun.

406
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:26,120
There's nothing here. Let's go.

407
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:53,000
False wall.

408
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,080
This is it.

409
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,760
Oh, God...

410
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:45,350
What have we got here?

411
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:50,600
Ten bucks says these are not
the lost "Honeymooners" episodes.

412
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
Well...

413
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,300
How she died does appear
to be linked to how she lived.

414
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,990
All right,

415
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:59,560
what we need to do here is hold on
to these tapes until we need them.

416
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,503
We empty the house, send
this all to the CID lab,

417
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
padlock the house,

418
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,280
and we'll take our chances with this
with the local police staying out.

419
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,000
Is this Paul Brenner speaking?

420
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,013
It's Paul Brenner, the career Army
officer speaking, not the cop.

421
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:15,600
The evidence of her killer might be on
that tape. I don't have to tell you that.

422
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,320
This evidence here can ruin
the lives of everyone involved.

423
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,760
Including the General.

424
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,160
Now look, we take the tapes,
use them when we need them,

425
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,320
let CID do their job.

426
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,080
and keep all non-military
out of this. Okay?

427
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:37,680
Okay.
- Okay.

428
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,560
I'll call Kent.

429
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:41,600
All right. Here.

430
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,760
Thanks.

431
00:38:05,227 --> 00:38:07,480
The phone's down. I'm gonna
go use the cell in the car.

432
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:47,800
Paul?

433
00:38:50,935 --> 00:38:51,430
Paul!

434
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:02,280
Did you make out a face?

435
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,640
Yep, it was flat, steel and
used to clear snow.

436
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,160
Come on!

437
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,640
Did you marry ever that guy
you were seeing on the side?

438
00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:14,560
Paul, this isn't exactly
the time to be...

439
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,040
Humor me. I'm near concussed.

440
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,560
Now, did you or did you not marry
the guy you were seeing on the side?

441
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,964
I was engaged to that guy.
I was seeing you on the side.

442
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:24,040
Fine...

443
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,510
So how is the boy Major?

444
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,840
Seemed a little annoyed the
last time I saw him in Brussels

445
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,280
with a pistol in his hand.

446
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:36,760
Make a hole!

447
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:44,360
Identification, please.

448
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:48,270
Are you working on the
murder case, Ma'am?

449
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,440
Yes I am, and
this is my father.

450
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,800
Please proceed.

451
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:13,520
What happened to you?

452
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,600
Went off-post without
civilian authority.

453
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,240
And my head paid
the price for it.

454
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,280
And there you go.

455
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,510
Per your request.
- Is this her entire record file?

456
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,320
That's it.

457
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,680
Come up with
anything yet?

458
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,040
Nope, just a preliminary
list of suspects.

459
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,080
Already?

460
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,880
Who?

461
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,920
Everyone.

462
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:35,155
Well, you ought to start getting alibis.
- Okay, how about you?

463
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:37,560
Home in bed
when the tower called.

464
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,060
Aha!

465
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,400
Oh, fuck off, Paul.
Where were you last night?

466
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,400
I was busy killing someone else.
I didn't have time to kill two people.

467
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,240
A likely story.
And you?

468
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,520
I went to the BOQ at 1900 hours,

469
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,520
I worked on my Neely case report until
about midnight and then I went home.

470
00:40:53,797 --> 00:40:55,000
No witnesses.

471
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,800
Pathetic, the both of you.

472
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,011
Oh, you should've invited me to
your room, and we'd have an alibi.

473
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:02,440
I would rather be
a murder suspect.

474
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,140
Huh.

475
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,400
Don't encourage her.

476
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,960
By the way, Cal Seaver's here.

477
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,880
Ah, good.

478
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,120
Now look, Cal is the
best friend's I ever have.

479
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,360
But don't say anything
about his hair.

480
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,600
What's wrong with his hair?

481
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,520
He don't have any.

482
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,120
Hey, Cal!

483
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,240
Shouldn't you be
wearing a hat?

484
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,280
What the hell
happened to you?

485
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,320
Well, you know. Not everybody
loves me as much as you do, Cal.

486
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,840
This is Sarah Sunhill.

487
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,800
Hello.
- How are you?

488
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,040
The entire world walked
around this body, Paul.

489
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,120
There's gotta be
fifty boot prints here.

490
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,480
Have you found
the clothes yet?

491
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:33,860
Not yet.

492
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,560
I figured you want some more space
so I commandeered an empty hangar.

493
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,060
Good man.

494
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,800
Have everything
taken out there.

495
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,400
Is there any trace of
semen on the victim?

496
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,760
I ran it on ultraviolet,
I can't find any.

497
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,520
The coroner will run
vaginal, oral and anal swabs

498
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,400
and we'll know about
that in due course.

499
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,480
It is a strange rape.
- Yeah.

500
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,680
Why do you say that?

501
00:41:52,183 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh, our guy wasn't just a rapist,
Excuse me.

502
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,560
he was a premeditated killer.

503
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,480
Observed it...

504
00:41:57,605 --> 00:42:02,200
He set up ---uh, a rape kit.
Tent pegs and ropes, and used it.

505
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,700
- Yeah.

506
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,400
Well, there are no
signs of a struggle.

507
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,120
And she was strong woman.

508
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,480
I couldn't find a bit of
dirt under her fingernails.

509
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,840
And how did he hold a gun on her
and managed to tie the ropes?

510
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,960
Unless it was more
than one person.

511
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,240
What are those marks on her cheeks?

512
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,080
Those were tears, Paul.

513
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,880
The panties under the rope as if to
protect her neck from a burn.

514
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:31,844
I mean, what's a little rope burn if
you're going to kill someone with it?

515
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:34,840
Sunhill's good.
- Oh, yeah.

516
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,280
Sunhill has spoken.

517
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:44,240
Could you see the body
from here, Private?

518
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,200
No, but I saw
the headlights.

519
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,120
The headlights?

520
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,916
I hated that it was her.

521
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:52,080
You knew her, then?

522
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,040
No, but...

523
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,240
Captain Campbell was a...

524
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,440
She was real good
to female enlisted.

525
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,480
How so?

526
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,347
She organized meetings for us and...

527
00:44:09,558 --> 00:44:13,120
See, there's a lot of shit,
I mean, there's a lot of stuff

528
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,360
if you're a woman in the Army to...

529
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,000
that you got
to put up with.

530
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,440
A lot of people don't
like it that we're here.

531
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:24,200
But Captain Campbell,
she encouraged us, and...

532
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:26,760
I'm sorry.

533
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,520
You're allowed to cry.
- No, it's all right.

534
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,520
It's all right.

535
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,540
Now, what about the
headlights that you ID'ed?

536
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,280
Didn't you think it was
someone coming home?

537
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,120
Or using the train,
or something?

538
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:38,760
Sometimes people go out
there in the middle of the night,

539
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,480
some nights to fuck.

540
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:44,120
Pardon my French.

541
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:48,760
But that's what I thought
the first time.

542
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,040
First time.
- First time?

543
00:44:50,678 --> 00:44:53,765
The first time I saw the
headlights was at 0300.

544
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:58,240
They went away, then
they came back at 0330.

545
00:44:58,352 --> 00:45:02,240
Then they went away again
and they came back at 0400.

546
00:45:04,941 --> 00:45:06,735
Okay. Thank you.

547
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,280
What's goin' on, Bill?

548
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,760
What are you
doing here, Yardley?

549
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,600
You got a shitload of
explaining to do, son.

550
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,120
May I ask what is your
official business is, here?

551
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,080
And my official
business here, son,

552
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,080
is to ask you why there's a
bunch of MP's hauling furniture

553
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,133
out of an off-post residence
that belongs to a murder victim?

554
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,080
The family of the deceased,
Chief Yardley,

555
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,360
asked me to take charge of those
items and transport them here.

556
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:42,040
Sunhill, remind me to call
General Campbell and suggest

557
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,430
that I take charge of those
items and transport them here?

558
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:44,936
You got it.

559
00:45:44,936 --> 00:45:46,480
Jesus, Paul...

560
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,240
You know what
you need, Chief Yardley?

561
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,315
Hope you don't mind, my saying?

562
00:45:49,315 --> 00:45:52,440
Is a pair of them mirrored sunglasses
for you and the little one.

563
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,520
That'd really complete
the picture.

564
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:01,990
So...

565
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,539
Did you ever marry
Major what's-his-name with the gun?

566
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:08,160
Yes, I did.

567
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:09,910
Ha...

568
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,600
Congratulations. I'm extremely
happy for you, Sarah

569
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,506
and wish you both the
best that life has to offer.

570
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:19,040
I filed for divorce.
- Good.

571
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,560
Thank you.

572
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,147
Two club sodas, please.

573
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,520
Let's go boys, c'mon!

574
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,920
Now is the place to bet!

575
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:47,800
You should see her records.

576
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,480
And there's your boyfriend
from the General's house.

577
00:46:50,871 --> 00:46:53,680
Valedictorian in high school.
Super athlete.

578
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,040
Speak West Point
like her Daddy dear.

579
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,680
Now, there's a guy who knows
how to have a good time.

580
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:00,830
Paul...

581
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,400
Look at me.

582
00:47:03,799 --> 00:47:05,520
I think something
happened to her there.

583
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,000
Elisabeth Campbell was...
tops her class and

584
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,721
she all went to shit her sophomore year.

585
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:11,800
She barely got through school.

586
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,920
Senior year was better. She managed
to graduate and get a degree,

587
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,880
but she was never
quite the same.

588
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,080
I thought you hated places like this.

589
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:24,580
I do.

590
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,946
However, the murderer
may be in this room.

591
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,440
Sitting all smug and shiny,

592
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,450
until we walked in.

593
00:47:32,701 --> 00:47:36,090
Now, maybe he's a little less
smug and a little less shiny.

594
00:47:36,746 --> 00:47:40,124
And that's pretty cool.
Don't you think?

595
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:43,920
What about you?

596
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,040
Well, I hope Brussels wasn't
the last time you had a woman.

597
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,840
Oh, right. Here we go.

598
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,520
Yeah, I always thought
that you chose to avoid

599
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,260
a confrontation with my fiancé,
like I wasn't worth the trouble.

600
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:57,080
The man threatened to kill me.
I chose discretion.

601
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,516
It is the better part of valor.

602
00:47:58,516 --> 00:48:01,680
Weren't you decorated for valor?
- Oh, please...

603
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:05,320
Sometimes you just gotta fight for
what you want.

604
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,360
That is... if you want it.

605
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,560
I received a Bronze Star for valor, Miss Sunhill,

606
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,960
for charging up a hill that
I didn't particularly need or want.

607
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,800
And besides, I don't remember getting
any encouragement from you.

608
00:48:17,324 --> 00:48:20,520
Well, maybe I want you not to
accept my decision to break it off.

609
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,912
Maybe I wanted you
to take me away...

610
00:48:21,912 --> 00:48:24,280
You're talking about telepathy
here, not communication.

611
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,499
You know, let's talk about
this next week, okay?

612
00:48:26,499 --> 00:48:26,990
Fine.

613
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,794
Just one more thing.
- Is this next week, already?

614
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:33,080
You're such a goddamn
sharp detective, aren't you?

615
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,640
but you sure can't reach yourself

616
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,040
and sure as hell don't
know a thing about women.

617
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:40,720
You know.

618
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,040
You're very cute
when I'm mad at you.

619
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,280
However...

620
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,600
If you'll excuse me.

621
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,480
I'll take my anger
out on someone else.

622
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,640
Ridiculous behavior earlier, I'm sorry.

623
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,600
Well, we didn't exactly
let you see it coming.

624
00:49:14,209 --> 00:49:17,800
Liz was, more or less, my protégé.
At least, I like to think she was.

625
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,500
We were...

626
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,500
Very close.

627
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,000
Please sit down.

628
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,200
Did you work together
on a daily basis?

629
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,440
Absolutely.

630
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,600
Did you...

631
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,080
...play together?

632
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:35,720
What a truly excellent question.

633
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,520
You see, here at Psy Ops,
that's one of the things we teach.

634
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,960
Threatening quietly.

635
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,070
Think of the echoes inherent
in those four simple words.

636
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:48,440
"Did you play together?"

637
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,120
Did you go out with her?

638
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,070
Did you fuck her?

639
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,320
Did you love her?

640
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,600
If you did, did you love her so
much that you murdered her?

641
00:49:57,749 --> 00:50:01,830
I meant, did you play golf or
tennis or checkers, or something?

642
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:06,080
No, you didn't.
- No, I didn't.

643
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:10,594
So now, we both know we're smart guys.
Do you think I'm involved in this?

644
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,860
One way or another, yes, I do.

645
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,360
Then it would behoove me to
retain the services of an attorney.

646
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,280
I know a good one.

647
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,600
Two problems there.

648
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,280
First, the obvious.
There are no good ones.

649
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:23,760
Second, you're not
a civilian, Colonel.

650
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,899
You're in the Army.

651
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:28,000
You have no right to an attorney.
You have no right to remain silent.

652
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,240
And if you don't cooperate,
I may have to put you in jail.

653
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,530
And that would
make me feel bad.

654
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,640
You see what
you're doing here?

655
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,000
Hmm.

656
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,784
Looking for answers?

657
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:39,287
Of course, that.
But how?

658
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,360
You're trying to
make me like you.

659
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,360
And you know what?
It's working. I do.

660
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,320
But now, do you see
what I'm trying to do?

661
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,280
I'm trying to make
you like me, too.

662
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,760
Do you like me yet?

663
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Why did you strangle her?

664
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,360
Wrong, sorry.
Not up to your standards.

665
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,160
Did you go to college?

666
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,180
What do you think?

667
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,380
I think you did not.

668
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,320
Why? Did I make a
mistake in grammar?

669
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,320
Of course, not.

670
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,440
Even if you were to, I wouldn't
be rude enough to point it out.

671
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:21,940
No.

672
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,780
You have this chip
on your shoulder.

673
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,380
A big one.

674
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,120
Makes you good at your
job, though, doesn't it?

675
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,880
I could imagine.

676
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,400
Holds you in good stead when you
see those commissioned officers,

677
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,320
those spit and
polish college types.

678
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,440
just waiting for you, you're
the scoundrel in the rumpled suit,

679
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,080
with a healthy
disdain for the rules,

680
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,360
just waiting to
bring them down.

681
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:43,920
Am I right?

682
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,160
Nah, I'm just here to
kick ass. Sleep till noon.

683
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,880
And you cover your
inadequacies with condescension

684
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,920
to the more robust
individuals around you.

685
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:57,080
How am I doing?
- Not bad. Robust, even.

686
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,160
When did...

687
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,120
...the event transpire?

688
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,571
0400, we think.

689
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:05,120
Hmm. See that? My quick
segueway back to the case.

690
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,575
Subtle as a chainsaw.
And where were you?

691
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:08,570
Snug in bed.

692
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:12,480
Witnesses? A wife, girlfriend,
roommate, hooker?

693
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:18,280
I'm divorced. I'm between girlfriends,
I live alone and I do not use hookers.

694
00:52:18,377 --> 00:52:22,600
I actually have absolutely
no alibi whatsoever.

695
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,840
Does that make me a killer?

696
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,440
No. It makes you
lonely and unpopular.

697
00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:32,880
Mmm, very good.
Condescending and clever.

698
00:52:33,557 --> 00:52:34,840
No, thank you.

699
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,360
Okay, so you
called her machine.

700
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,460
You were very concerned.
What is this?

701
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,520
Jealousy, perhaps?
- Perhaps not.

702
00:52:47,194 --> 00:52:50,280
Liz was my friend. I hadn't
heard from her in a couple days.

703
00:52:52,533 --> 00:52:55,920
Okay, so, as her friend, did you
know anyone she was involved with?

704
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,280
You mean sexually?

705
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,760
Yes, sexually.

706
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,520
She was seeing someone.
A civilian.

707
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,400
A fellow named Yardley.

708
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,080
Police Chief Yardley?

709
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:09,900
No.

710
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:11,900
No...

711
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,900
Ah, okay.

712
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,760
The son.

713
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,040
His deputy.

714
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,880
Wes.

715
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,920
Yes, Wes. Yes, okay.

716
00:53:19,307 --> 00:53:21,480
They've been seeing
each other, off and on.

717
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,200
For a few months...

718
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,240
Okay, so ah, it's obvious
you were very close to her.

719
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,920
We're trying to find
out what "very" means.

720
00:53:28,899 --> 00:53:29,960
It means...

721
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,500
Very.

722
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:35,600
I was Liz's mentor.

723
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,080
There was a trust.

724
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,200
She was...

725
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,960
Yes, a passionate young woman
as well, she should've been.

726
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,840
But had I...

727
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,240
ever taken advantage of that?

728
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:50,880
I would have lost the trust.

729
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,360
So did I kill her?
Of course, not.

730
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,720
Did I love her?

731
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,080
I loved her very much.

732
00:54:03,055 --> 00:54:04,680
Make of that what you will.

733
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:25,720
This is what made
him famous, isn't it?

734
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,640
Oh yeah, the Ledgeworth City riots.

735
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,960
The whole city was in chaos.

736
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,840
The General quelled it.

737
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,400
Then he brought in unarmed troops

738
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,920
and his little daughter.

739
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,880
Just to prove it was safe.

740
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,280
She looks terrified.

741
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
Excellent work.

742
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,440
I'm gonna head down to the morgue.

743
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,320
The report should be in.
You wanna come?

744
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,600
No, we'll be there.
I gotta talk to Cal.

745
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,100
Cal!

746
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,340
Coming.

747
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,240
So how's Moore?

748
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,520
Complicated.

749
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,780
Yeah?

750
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,600
Cal...

751
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,960
We got the dog tag
links back from the lab.

752
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,080
Partial prints belong to somebody
other than Captain Campbell.

753
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,800
Who's that?

754
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,740
Robert Moore.

755
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,060
Hello.

756
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,509
Smells good.

757
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,480
What are you doing here?

758
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,800
I'm here to ask you
a question, Bobby.

759
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,360
And the question is?

760
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:50,820
Why were you so stupid as to
leave your fingerprints everywhere?

761
00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:56,075
- My answer --- you panicked.
- I teach panic, remember?

762
00:55:56,075 --> 00:55:56,570
Yeah?

763
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:59,520
Well, obviously I didn't plan for things
to work out this way.

764
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,520
Define "things".

765
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,560
Look, Paul.

766
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,160
Can I call you 'Paul'?

767
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,360
I so enjoyed when you took
the liberty of calling me Bobby.

768
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,280
Here, I still assumed we're still
trying to outsmart each other.

769
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,520
Obviously, Paul.

770
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,800
I cannot tell a lie and say

771
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,000
I know nothing about all this.

772
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,320
I also, sadly...

773
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,440
cannot tell the truth.

774
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,280
And you think silence
won't save your ass.

775
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,600
My ass, as you so delicately put it,

776
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,920
is already in a sling, is it not?

777
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,480
You mean the sex tapes?

778
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,720
You're good...

779
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,640
Great question. Almost any answer
incriminates me, doesn't it?

780
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,040
Yep.

781
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,040
That's why I like it.

782
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,480
Yes, so let's cut the bullshit.
- Let's do that.

783
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,120
We both know I'm
pretty much destroyed.

784
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,720
Can you think of any
compelling reason

785
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,880
why Elisabeth should be
destroyed along with me?

786
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,760
Can you? I can't.

787
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:08,760
Paul.

788
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,160
I watched the two of you...

789
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,240
...on one of her tapes.

790
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,720
I don't think so.

791
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,680
You know, bluffing is the last
desperate act of the weak, Paul.

792
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,520
I'll not help you ruin that girl.

793
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,120
She's suffered enough.
Leave it there.

794
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:33,640
I'm all you've got.

795
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Wrong again.

796
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Hello, Captain.

797
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,000
Hello.

798
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Capt. Goodson is with the
Judge Advocate's Office.

799
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,480
He's also my lawyer.

800
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,594
From now on, anything you
have to say to Colonel Moore...

801
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,590
I'll say to Colonel Moore...

802
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,720
Now listen, Brenner.

803
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,280
Don't think you
can bully my client.

804
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,840
You know, I'm done bullying.

805
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,560
You're under arrest, Bobby.

806
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,360
Conduct unbecoming an officer,
plus starter for [Art.] 134.

807
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,080
Disorderly neglect, accessory after the fact,

808
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,120
conspiracy, making false statements.
And...

809
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,440
Captain, you're on the
verge, marked for [Art.] 98.

810
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,680
Non-compliance with procedural rules.

811
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,880
Can I help you, ma'am?

812
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,480
Just taking another look.

813
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,560
- Go ahead, ma'am.
- Thank you.

814
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,920
Is it possible, the bag
with the victim's clothes,

815
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,080
was going to be
picked up by her killer?

816
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,760
or by a third party?

817
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,000
Five Charlie, do you copy?

818
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,220
This is Five Charlie.

819
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,680
Maybe she was here
for a secret rendezvous.

820
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,640
A tryst.

821
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,200
Maybe the rape fantasy
was part of the thrill.

822
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,512
We all know she had a predilection
for the gamier side of sex.

823
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,400
Is there anything to the argument

824
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,840
Elisabeth Campbell picked what
amounted to a nearly public place

825
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,080
because it presented an element of...?

826
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,320
Hold that bitch down!
Let me get in there.

827
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,440
This is the Army...

828
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,040
So you tell Brenner you don't
shit on your brothers.

829
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,000
Rape investigator, huh?

830
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,080
Want to know what
it feels like, huh?

831
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,320
Maybe. . .Maybe it'll make you
better at your job. Huh?

832
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,360
Number five.

833
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,520
- Got yourself a
colonel this time, huh?

834
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,160
Shut up Hawkins.

835
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,880
You were acting as her shrink,
were you not?

836
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:48,760
Were you not?

837
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,720
The Elisabeth I met
was bright and shiny.

838
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,680
The woman on the
tape was a different lady.

839
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,280
And there's a direct connection,
isn't there?

840
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,160
Isn't there?

841
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,840
Are you going to pull
my fingernails out now?

842
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,280
What happened at her sophomore
year at the Point?

843
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,400
You're a murderer or
an accessory to murder!

844
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,560
Either way you get
burned at the stake.

845
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,960
Nobody's going to bail you out.

846
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:43,600
It was awful.

847
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,640
It was awful. Go ahead.

848
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,120
What? She violated the Code?
She cheated, she lied, what?

849
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,000
Worse.

850
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:00,960
Drugs?

851
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,160
Worse.

852
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:03,960
Rape?

853
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,360
Worse.

854
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,560
What's worse than rape?

855
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,720
When you find that out,

856
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,240
then you'll know
everything, won't you?

857
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,520
Tell me what the
hell happened, Bill.

858
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,560
Look, I'm sorry Paul,

859
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,320
but the MP claims he got a
radio call to leave his post.

860
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,840
I've got no record of that call.

861
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,160
Probably a dead end, but I'm taking it further.

862
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,360
I'm pulling up, talk to me later.

863
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,920
- She's fine, Paul.
- Who did it?

864
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,160
- I'm okay.
- Who did it?

865
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:21,760
Stupid play, Elby.

866
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,000
Perky move.

867
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,440
Be sure to remember to take off all
identifying jewelry before an attack.

868
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,840
I don't know what
you're talking about?

869
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,800
I told you I was in
the "O" Club all night.

870
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,160
She's crazy, and you're crazy.

871
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,280
- You burned me.
- Sorry.

872
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,200
Sorry about that. You just can't
get good Styrofoam these days.

873
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,760
Okay, let's change the subject.

874
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,040
What can you tell me about
Capt. Elisabeth Campbell?

875
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:47,700
What about her?

876
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,720
She was raped and killed.
You know what rape usually is?

877
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,280
It's a woman who changes
her mind afterward.

878
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,960
Would you classify your relationship with
Elisabeth Campbell as an intimate one?

879
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,760
- You mean, was I fucking her?
- Yeah, that is what I mean.

880
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:07,320
Yeah.

881
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:08,856
I was...

882
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,400
But that's all I took it for

883
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,440
you know, just sport fucking.

884
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,040
I didn't think she's just
gonna run off and tell him.

885
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,480
- Tell who?
- The General.

886
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,600
The bitch told the General.

887
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,200
Why?

888
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,840
Because she's a freak and
that's what freaks do.

889
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,900
What about the General and Capt.
Campbell, were they close?

890
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:23,680
- No.
- Why not?

891
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,280
I don't know.
You like your dad?

892
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,560
My dad was a drunk, a gambler,
a womanizer. I worshipped him.

893
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,160
Yeah, well I think
I've said enough.

894
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,100
You cooperate, and maybe
we'll keep it out of the report.

895
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:40,960
You guys don't get it.

896
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:46,090
With Elisabeth gone, the General has got
a clear field to settle some scores.

897
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:52,520
And I'll be given the
opportunity to resign.

898
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,600
Maybe I can save my marriage,
or maybe I can't.

899
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,220
Oh great, there's a Mrs Elby.

900
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,000
And what does she do,

901
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
aside from waking up in the
middle of the night, screaming?

902
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,640
What do you mean,
settle some scores?

903
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,780
Okay! I told you,
I'm done talking to you.

904
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,480
Hey, we just got started, Elby.

905
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,260
I'll bring you up on charges
for the assault on Agent Sunhill.

906
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,960
See how you like four years of
sport fucking in a military prison.

907
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,600
Okay, dare me.

908
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,000
Go ahead, motherfucker, dare me.

909
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:24,640
Now, I'm going to ask
you one more time.

910
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,120
What do you mean
by 'settle some scores'?

911
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,000
Okay, okay!
Okay, okay!

912
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,160
When she was alive,

913
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,680
He couldn't touch her...

914
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,080
...without embarrassing himself.

915
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,760
He couldn't touch any of us,

916
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,160
because he knew
she would spill all.

917
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:54,660
All?

918
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:55,860
Meaning,

919
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,720
imagine what'd it look like?

920
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,440
the General's daughter banging
his entire male staff.

921
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,440
- Entire male staff...
- Yeah.

922
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:04,960
Yeah, everybody.

923
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,720
At least most of them.

924
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,800
What about the Sheriff's son?

925
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,560
No, that was just for show.

926
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:15,240
She was pulling along
this military train imaginable,

927
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:18,520
right up the chain, she went through
most of the General's immediate staff,

928
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,680
plus the staff Judge Advocate,
and people like me in key positions.

929
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,440
What about Col. Fowler?

930
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,680
Colonel Fowler once told me
he knew all about this.

931
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,280
And that I was
part of the problem.

932
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,880
I think he meant
that he wasn't.

933
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,680
What do you think
about this, Agent Sunhill?

934
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,440
I think it's insane.

935
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,120
Not really, Elisabeth once told me,

936
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,960
she was conducting a field
experiment in psychological warfare.

937
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,920
And that the enemy was Daddy.

938
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,240
- You okay?
- I've been better.

939
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,860
- God, Paul.
- I know, I know.

940
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,600
Most of these officers are married,
it's immediate grounds for court martial.

941
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,760
Their lives are over.
But I'll tell you this:

942
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,120
It's a helluva motive for murder.

943
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,920
How's it feel that our suspect
list is multiplying exponentially.

944
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,560
Well, at least we know the guys
who were on the tapes.

945
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,360
Yeah, a bunch of creeps willing
to risk it all for a piece of patch.

946
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,560
A piece of patch?

947
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,040
Sorry darling, I just
get back on the base

948
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,150
and it dredges up all my
old alpha male behavior.

949
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,680
Great, what's next, you're gonna do
ear-funnel and light your own farts?

950
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,440
- Maybe, after we see more.
- Oh, I can't wait.

951
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,200
Where is he?

952
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,000
- Bill, where's Moore?
- Oh, he was released.

953
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,000
What?

954
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,120
Restricted to quarters.

955
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,540
On whose orders?

956
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,160
On mine. It looked like he was
having a damn heart attack, Paul.

957
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,920
His lawyer came in
had a valid complaint.

958
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,120
Hey, you can't put an
officer in common lock-up.

959
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,880
He's a murder suspect, Bill!

960
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,200
Since when?

961
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,360
Since...His prints were all
over the goddamn tags!

962
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,120
Well, you never informed us
he was a murder suspect.

963
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,680
He was being held here
for conduct unbecoming.

964
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:06,440
Not murder.

965
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,600
I had no choice.

966
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:08,600
Bill?

967
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,600
I had no choice.

968
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:47,440
Moore?

969
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:08,680
Moore!

970
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,760
I'm going in.

971
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:17,920
Oh, my God.

972
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,180
The organics on Elisabeth
Campbell came back.

973
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,240
There's no sign of rape.

974
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,880
- What are your thoughts on this?
- Apparent suicide.

975
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,920
Star pattern. Close contact
wound. And I don't buy it.

976
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,080
I'll do a UAV, check his
hands for gunpowder residue.

977
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,280
I'll let you know if I
find any inconsistencies.

978
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,575
Colonel Kent!

979
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:15,940
Yeah?

980
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,520
Were you aware of Elisabeth
Campbell's extracurricular activities?

981
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,460
How do you mean?

982
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,420
You know what I mean.

983
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,040
There were rumors, innuendo.

984
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,200
I always took it
as false bravado.

985
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,520
You know, soldiers bragging,
that sort of thing.

986
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,520
But there was more
to it than that.

987
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,600
Mr. Brenner.

988
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,040
As soon as you're
through here,

989
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,600
We'll convene at
the General's house

990
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,200
to coordinate the release
of the official findings.

991
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,720
What are you talking about?

992
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,920
Obviously, Moore was
overwhelmed with guilt.

993
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,320
We need to close up shop.

994
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,600
The General would
have it classified.

995
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,760
We'll release a statement
about Moore's guilt and suicide.

996
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:12,080
You don't understand,
Colonel Fowler.

997
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,480
This is my investigation,
and it's still open.

998
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,040
Who the hell do you think you are?

999
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,137
It's over.
Over!

1000
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,920
You'd better start thinking about
your career, you understand me?

1001
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,520
You'd better start
thinking about yours.

1002
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,360
You're running a
lunatic base here.

1003
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,160
You want to mess
with me, Colonel?

1004
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,320
Let's start gouging away.

1005
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,860
You've been warned.

1006
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,060
Move out.

1007
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,680
What are you
doing here, Yardley?

1008
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,240
Shouldn't you be out
night-sticking the colored folk?

1009
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:08,513
Wait in the car,
I want to talk to him.

1010
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,641
Your son Wes,
we've got to speak to him.

1011
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,320
Apparently, he was
involved with the victim,

1012
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,080
but you neglected
to mention that to us.

1013
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,840
He's on duty
when it happened.

1014
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,800
His partner can verify that.

1015
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,840
We got tapes of his
radio calls all night long

1016
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,400
Just the same,
we'll be in touch.

1017
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,600
Good night.

1018
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:34,620
Asshole.

1019
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:44,960
What is that?

1020
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,040
The gods have smiled
on you, Paul Brenner.

1021
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,440
Oh yeah, why is that?

1022
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,640
Because this is a West Point

1023
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,640
psychological report on Elisabeth Campbell

1024
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,440
and pages from her medical file.

1025
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,720
Pages we were never given.

1026
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,320
Well, what does it say?

1027
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,120
It says we're going to West Point.

1028
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:12,940
Yes?

1029
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,360
- Brenner and Sunhill, sir.
- Come in. Come in.

1030
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:19,960
And talk loud.

1031
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,880
Terrible thing for a shrink to lose.

1032
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,520
Can't hear some my
patients half the time.

1033
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,640
Of course, considering
some of my patients.

1034
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,000
Maybe it's a blessing.

1035
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,280
Col. Slesinger... Do you prefer
being called Colonel or Doctor?

1036
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,240
I prefer Donald. And I'm assuming you
didn't fly here from McCallum to bullshit.

1037
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,760
No, sir. It's what I
told you on the phone.

1038
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:47,000
Yes, and I told you on the phone
that I can't talk about Capt. Campbell.

1039
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,680
Nothing has changed.

1040
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:52,720
- You were her psychiatrist?
- And a poor one, at that.

1041
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,528
Well, she was at the end of her sophomore
year when she came to see you.

1042
01:14:57,528 --> 01:14:58,840
She was must've been about 20.

1043
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,560
She was in a
serious depression.

1044
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:05,360
I take it from your presence here,
Lizzie's in some trouble again?

1045
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,360
Not now.

1046
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,240
That's good.

1047
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:12,680
Well, she's too
young to be dead...

1048
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,480
She was strangled, sir.

1049
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,320
Mock raped and then strangled.

1050
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,480
Goddammit! Goddammit!

1051
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,652
I couldn't help her.

1052
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:47,740
I tried, but I couldn't unlock
her enough to trust me.

1053
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:50,440
But you know what?

1054
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,960
I still can't talk about her.

1055
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
No, you can't.

1056
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,960
But you're angry, yes?

1057
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,160
Of course.

1058
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,880
Sometimes when I'm angry
I talk to myself out loud.

1059
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:10,880
Do you ever do that,
just sort of rant?

1060
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,440
Yes, sometimes.

1061
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,160
Or, if you were to rant...

1062
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,280
and we happened
to be in the vicinity...

1063
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,840
- Free country.
- That's my thoughts exactly.

1064
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:37,760
She sets the place on fire,
our Lizzy does.

1065
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:39,800
Top woman here.

1066
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,760
Pretty as hell.

1067
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,120
Outdoes most of the men
in the training runs.

1068
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,680
At the end of her sophomore year-

1069
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,480
- there was a big night exercise.

1070
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,760
There must have been
thousands involved.

1071
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,520
Lizzy got separated from her group.

1072
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,760
Found herself with about
a half a dozen men.

1073
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,640
A very dark night.

1074
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:31,880
Not only were the
men unknown to her,

1075
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,200
- but they were also
wearing camouflage.

1076
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,400
They raped her
almost to death.

1077
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,520
Raped her all night long.

1078
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:45,840
Taking turns.

1079
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:48,780
Stripped her.

1080
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,800
Spread-eagled her.

1081
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,600
Nailed her to the
earth with tent pegs.

1082
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,520
Just had a
whale of a time.

1083
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,320
Threatened to kill her
if she talked.

1084
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,040
Tied her underwear
around her throat?

1085
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:20,220
Yes.

1086
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,880
Lizzy was hospitalized.

1087
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,400
Treated for venereal disease.

1088
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,400
Treated for pregnancy.

1089
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:43,280
By the time I got to her,
she had gone away inside.

1090
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,200
Never let me get close.

1091
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,080
Who were these guys?

1092
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:49,640
I need a name.

1093
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:53,400
No. Sorry. Medical ethics.

1094
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,080
I'm gonna finish
my work here.

1095
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,120
I can't tell you
what to do, but...

1096
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:06,560
You go back to my office.
The key's under the mat.

1097
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,760
You would look
up Lizzy's files,

1098
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,440
you might find an additional notation
there with a man's name on it.

1099
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,880
It might be worth your while
to stoop. It's up to you.

1100
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,880
Free country and all that.

1101
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,640
Sorry I couldn't
be of any help.

1102
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,720
Beginning our descent
to Fort Benning, ma'am.

1103
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:58,320
Now, Ranger! Let's go!

1104
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:03,160
- Female on the floor!
- Female on the floor!

1105
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,520
Female on the floor.

1106
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,560
Capt. Bransford?

1107
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:13,760
Uh-oh.

1108
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,400
Yeah. That would be me.

1109
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,720
What can I do
for you, honey?

1110
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:20,440
Better yet, what can
you do for me?

1111
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,680
Well, dear, you can ask
these other men to excuse us.

1112
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,800
Yeah, that's a CID badge
you're looking at.

1113
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,200
Looks like I picked
the wrong woman to "honey".

1114
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:38,920
Hmm, that's right.

1115
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:43,240
I'm Sarah Sunhill, Captain.
I'm a rape investigator for the CID.

1116
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,680
We need to talk about
Elisabeth Campbell.

1117
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,760
Right. Liz...

1118
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,320
Liz and I were classmates
together at the Point.

1119
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,960
Oh, I only have
just one question:

1120
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,160
How scared are
you right now?

1121
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:04,120
I'm sorry, Miss Sunhill. Is it possible
that you're in the wrong place?

1122
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,640
Your heart's racing
a little faster.

1123
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,960
There's a little ball in your
throat sticking under the arms.

1124
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,640
- Yeah, I think that's enough.
- You can sit your ass back down.

1125
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,000
I know you weren't the leader.

1126
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,200
If you say so, Miss Sunhill,

1127
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,740
but I really do not know what
in the world, you're referring to.

1128
01:22:27,061 --> 01:22:28,360
You're too weak
to have started it.

1129
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,600
You're just a guy who's gotten
by on his smile and his charm.

1130
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,480
Well, that's a good smile. But
you could never lead a rape.

1131
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,320
Well, that sure is
good to know.

1132
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:41,600
Elisabeth Campbell was murdered
thirty-six hours ago.

1133
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,680
Staked out with tent pegs
and strangled.

1134
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,240
So I'm gonna ask you that
question again, Capt. Bransford:

1135
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,800
How scared are
you right now?

1136
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,000
I was right here
on the post, lady.

1137
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,360
But you were right there,
seven years ago on maneuvers.

1138
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,480
You were right
there for the rape.

1139
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,720
You can't prove shit.

1140
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,280
That's not what
Dr. Slesinger's records say.

1141
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:06,400
Yeah, okay. I went
to see Slesinger.

1142
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:10,760
And I told him a story
that I had heard.

1143
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:14,440
That's what his
records say, Miss Sunhill.

1144
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,720
It was just a story.

1145
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:19,120
Somebody else's story.
And that's it. Understand?

1146
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,400
- What is that?
- What does it look like?

1147
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,280
Well, it looks
like underwear.

1148
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,080
Women's underwear.

1149
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,720
Amazing scientific changes
in the last few years, Captain.

1150
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,480
Won't you agree?
Amazing scientific changes
in the last few years, Captain.

1151
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,552
Won't you agree?

1152
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:50,040
I wouldn't know.

1153
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,120
Certain fields?

1154
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,120
It's been incredible.

1155
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,480
- If you say so.
- Like DNA.

1156
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:59,120
If it's there, it's there forever.

1157
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,400
But then, you probably
already knew that.

1158
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:07,120
Those are hers, aren't they?

1159
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:19,560
I tried to stop it.

1160
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,320
I did everything I could.

1161
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:25,800
But they hated her.

1162
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,000
They hated her so much.

1163
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,200
They hated that she
was smarter than them.

1164
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,426
they hated to be out there with
somewhere to squat to piss.

1165
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,360
I tried to save her,
I did everything I could

1166
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,600
but I couldn't
make 'em stop.

1167
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:41,934
Who were the others?

1168
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,120
It was my recon squad.

1169
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,960
Their names are
in the yearbook.

1170
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,760
Liz was my friend.

1171
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,360
Thank you very much
Captain for your cooperation.

1172
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,120
Someone from CID
will be in touch.

1173
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,560
What are you doing?

1174
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:09,040
What does it look like?

1175
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,680
- What about the DNA?
- What DNA?

1176
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,720
I bought those an hour ago.

1177
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,760
So long, honey.

1178
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:46,400
That's a positive match, right?

1179
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:50,120
Yep, Paul. It's only a partial boot
print, but it's definitely Col. Fowler's

1180
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,720
and it's right next to the body.

1181
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,960
Good.
Good work.

1182
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,920
Now look, we've only got
'til the end of the day,

1183
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,360
then the Feds are
gonna be all over us.

1184
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:57,480
Gotta go.

1185
01:25:59,000 --> 01:25:59,500
Hi.

1186
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,200
Look, I got a lot on
my plate just now.

1187
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,960
I just. . .I just want to thank
you for everything you did.

1188
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:04,460
For what?

1189
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,280
For leaving the medical
records in the car.

1190
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:12,280
Now, did he instruct you to
give me the medical records?

1191
01:26:12,683 --> 01:26:13,880
Not in so many words.

1192
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,880
But I think I
knew his wishes.

1193
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,800
You know. Anything
that might help Elisabeth.

1194
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,240
I'm sure you know
how much he loved her.

1195
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,800
Not as much
as he loved you.

1196
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,040
What do you mean?

1197
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,200
Well, you know.

1198
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,400
Something about the surprise way
that you came in that night,

1199
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,040
the extra care he had
in making dinner.

1200
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,600
What do you planning
on doing about it?

1201
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,600
Not a thing.

1202
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,920
Other than to tell you that
I'm sorry about Moore.

1203
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,720
To ask you for your help.
Here, sit down.

1204
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,160
What exactly do
you need to know?

1205
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,000
I wanna know about the
recreation of the original rape.

1206
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,200
I suppose that's
what it was.

1207
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,120
Was it Moore's
idea to do this?

1208
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,080
Think can cleanse her of her past?
- Oh, no. Jesus, no.

1209
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:52,760
She thought it up.

1210
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:54,320
He couldn't talk
her out of it.

1211
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,600
I'd say, he thought so, so
bad that he killed himself?

1212
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,240
Look, you and I both know
that's not how this happened.

1213
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,200
And that's where they screwed up,
whoever did this.

1214
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:07,660
Because, they didn't
know about Bob...

1215
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:08,240
...and me.

1216
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:12,480
Bob could no sooner
have killed himself.

1217
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,080
I could pull a chicken
out of my hair.

1218
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,040
But these are various
types, they don't get that.

1219
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,360
You know, they
don't understand that.

1220
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,560
Affairs of the heart.

1221
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,560
Way beyond them.

1222
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,720
Okay, so he staged this thing.

1223
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:25,880
He tied her up. He then got
rid of her clothes, what?

1224
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,760
Yeah, and he also had to make
the call to the General.

1225
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:29,920
Play him the tape.

1226
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:31,280
The tape?

1227
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,440
General... Brenner.

1228
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,400
Paul, come in, please.

1229
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:12,400
Just wanted to
say goodbye, sir.

1230
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:14,800
I'm driving back to headquarters
in the morning.

1231
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,600
I'm leaving tomorrow, too.

1232
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,440
I'm taking Elisabeth to Michigan,

1233
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,440
- to be buried next to her mother.

1234
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:25,440
Thank you...

1235
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:27,280
...for everything you did.

1236
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,800
I understand you're
still going into politics, sir?

1237
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,320
Well, the jury's still out.

1238
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:34,320
We'll see.

1239
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,840
When you just thanked
me for what I had done,

1240
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,720
what I wanted to say to you,

1241
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,880
was I really didn't do anything.

1242
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,880
At least, not anything right.

1243
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,080
I did a lot of things
that were wrong.

1244
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,800
You're not responsible
for Moore's death, Paul.

1245
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,760
Any good investigator has
to follow his instincts.

1246
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,520
I'd like to talk to you
about that, sir.

1247
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:02,840
We all know that Moore did it,
then killed himself out of guilt.

1248
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:03,960
Then we're all in agreement.

1249
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,240
And I got thinking. . .

1250
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:06,920
But what if, I was wrong?

1251
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:10,480
What if it wasn't the same car three
times, but three different cars?

1252
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,040
That's certainly an interesting theory.

1253
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,600
But, what difference does it
make, since Moore is dead?

1254
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,760
Probably none, sir.

1255
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,280
It got me thinking
about your daughter,

1256
01:29:19,769 --> 01:29:21,240
and what she told
me. she taught.

1257
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:26,120
"Mostly we fuck with
people's minds," she said.

1258
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:27,280
Okay, then.

1259
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:29,840
Thank you, Brenner.

1260
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
You can go now.

1261
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,760
- Tell me about the rape.
- But she wasn't raped.

1262
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,040
It was just made to
appear that way.

1263
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,320
The rape at West Point.

1264
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,000
It was kept confidential.

1265
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,880
- For the good of the Academy.
- And the Army.

1266
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,160
And it was best for
Elisabeth, that way.

1267
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,720
You were in Germany
when it happened?

1268
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:59,200
Berlin. I was stationed there.

1269
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,520
I came back as soon as I heard.
We flew all night.

1270
01:30:03,351 --> 01:30:05,080
And you went straight
there from the airport?

1271
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,160
Of course.

1272
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:07,880
No meeting first?

1273
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:17,520
- Seems, Mr. Brenner is very well informed.
- It was in her psych records, sir.

1274
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,080
It didn't happen that way.

1275
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:23,320
George...

1276
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,080
He's right.

1277
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,880
The meeting did come first.

1278
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,320
It was seven years ago.

1279
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,600
The details get confusing.

1280
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:38,440
It was nothing. Just a quick briefing
in a hotel near the Point.

1281
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:41,720
General Sonnenberg.
He was very...

1282
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:43,840
...sympathetic.

1283
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,400
I want justice for my daughter.

1284
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:53,500
I would give anything if this
had never happened.

1285
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,920
But it did.

1286
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,960
And I'm trying to tell you
the reality of the situation.

1287
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,160
We'll never find them. Someone
we'll never know who did it.

1288
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:03,440
But we do know this. . .

1289
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:07,640
A co-ed academy is a good call.
And a necessary call.

1290
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:12,040
Better one unreported
and unvindicated rape,

1291
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,440
than to shake the foundations
of West Point.

1292
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,240
To cast suspicion on a thousand
soldiers who did not gang-rape her.

1293
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,280
One woman, that night.

1294
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,080
All we have to do
is convince your daughter,

1295
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:32,620
that she, the Academy,
the Army and the call of equality,

1296
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:36,840
would be best served if she
just forgot about the whole thing.

1297
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:40,280
These are the times
we live in, Joe.

1298
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:43,440
He was right.

1299
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,320
If it had gone public,

1300
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:49,400
it would have permanently
damaged women in the military.

1301
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:56,400
It would've destroyed West Point.
It was an untenable situation.

1302
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,920
Is that what you
told Elisabeth?

1303
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,560
Not in so many words, no.

1304
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:08,120
She was in no condition
to understand that then.

1305
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:11,040
I simply tried to tell her
that I loved her.

1306
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,960
I loved her very much.

1307
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:20,320
Daddy loves you.

1308
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:23,800
And he's so proud of you.

1309
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,320
Rest now. Try not to
think about it anymore.

1310
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:37,760
Listen to me.
I only want what's best for you.

1311
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:44,000
Trust me.
Do you? Like you always did?

1312
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:53,160
Then don't ever think about
any of this again.

1313
01:32:54,500 --> 01:33:00,000
I know, I know. It's an awful thing.
A terrible, terrible thing.

1314
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:04,520
But thinking about it won't help it.
So...

1315
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:09,280
Close your eyes.

1316
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,357
It never happened.

1317
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,840
None of this ever happened.

1318
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,360
Not my finest hour.

1319
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,440
You were just doing
what you said.

1320
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:52,640
Trying to protect her.

1321
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:54,800
I did what I had to.

1322
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,960
What I thought best
for everyone concerned.

1323
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,480
Nothing else that
could've been done.

1324
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:06,600
They never would have
found them, anyway.

1325
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,080
- Here you are, sir.
- What is that?

1326
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:17,160
The names of the perpetrators,
by associate Agent Sunhill.

1327
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,560
Found with a
minimum of trouble.

1328
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,040
Apple pie, sir.

1329
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,640
That's just brilliant.

1330
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:27,840
Each man will be
looking at 20 years, sir.

1331
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,320
I think you'd
better go now.

1332
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:30,760
Fine.

1333
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,240
We'll just deal with the
phone call issue tomorrow.

1334
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,040
If you prefer, perhaps
before your flight.

1335
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:39,640
What phone call issue?

1336
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,400
I have excellent
reason to believe

1337
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,240
that Moore phoned you at 0300
hours, the night of the murder.

1338
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,120
And why in the world would
he have done that?

1339
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,000
Well, if I'm right, sir,

1340
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,400
I think the whole recreation
of the rape was Elisabeth's idea.

1341
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:57,960
God knows
why she did it.

1342
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,320
Perhaps, because you
were going into politics.

1343
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,163
She thought it
was her last chance.

1344
01:35:01,163 --> 01:35:05,860
But I think she got Moore to put her in
exactly the same position as the rapists did.

1345
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:07,040
Seven years ago.

1346
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,120
This time, you weren't in Germany.

1347
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,000
And if I'm right,

1348
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,480
she would've wanted you to see
firsthand what you covered up.

1349
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,520
That never happened!

1350
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,240
A gift from Moore's lawyer.

1351
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:23,440
<i>Dad, this is Elisabeth. I need to discuss
something extremely urgent with you.</i>

1352
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:27,360
<i>You must meet me at the mount
site no later than 0330 hours.</i>

1353
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,800
<i>I have an answer
to your ultimatum.</i>

1354
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:37,680
It's hard to argue with a recorded voice.
I'm sure it was part of her plan.

1355
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:40,320
What does she mean
by 'an ultimatum', sir?

1356
01:35:41,630 --> 01:35:43,120
I gave her two options:

1357
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,920
Resign her commission,
or agree to some sort of therapy.

1358
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,080
If she rejected
both of those,

1359
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,520
I would instruct the staff judge advocate
to investigate her misconduct

1360
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:58,480
and draw up charges
for a general court martial.

1361
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,600
I'm sure that must seems callous to you.

1362
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:06,200
So you drove out
to the mount site.

1363
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:07,880
Of course.

1364
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,400
I needed an answer.

1365
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:15,560
Here's the answer
to your damn ultimatum.

1366
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,740
Jesus Christ...

1367
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,400
Do you see what
they did to me?

1368
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:21,160
Do you see?

1369
01:36:22,420 --> 01:36:24,080
Don't turn away,
you coward.

1370
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:28,800
Come closer, get a better look.
See what they put me through.

1371
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,160
What the fuck, do you
hope to accomplish?

1372
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:35,920
There's a rope around my neck.
You can strangle me if you want to.

1373
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,560
Just cover it up like you did before.

1374
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,240
Have you gone
completely out of your mind?

1375
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:44,920
It happened.

1376
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:47,240
It happened!

1377
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,280
I want to hear you
say it happened.

1378
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:54,960
I don't give a damn what happened
to you seven years ago.

1379
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:58,680
Whatever hurts you
makes me stronger.

1380
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,200
The damage would not destroy me,
it makes me stronger.

1381
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,440
You can't hurt me anymore.

1382
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,560
- We're even.
- That's fine with me.

1383
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:13,800
You never helped me!

1384
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,280
Daddy, please don't go.

1385
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:20,520
Come back.

1386
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:22,600
Please...

1387
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:23,960
Please...

1388
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:29,580
Daddy...

1389
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,240
You were in
the second car.

1390
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,840
Which means Col. Fowler...

1391
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:48,720
...must have
been in the third.

1392
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,480
You couldn't expect a man
to deal with his own child.

1393
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,783
She was screaming
such vituperations at him.

1394
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:04,040
Of course not.

1395
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:07,360
So he called me.

1396
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:10,320
And he asked me to deal with it.

1397
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:12,760
I went...

1398
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:16,640
And I found her dead.

1399
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,800
- You found her dead?
- Of course.

1400
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:28,360
But you will never get me
to testify against the General.

1401
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:30,920
What?

1402
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:34,820
I've been by Joe Campbell's side...

1403
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:37,280
...too many times.

1404
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,520
Looked death in
the face with him...

1405
01:38:41,863 --> 01:38:43,080
...too many times.

1406
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,160
I'll not back down now.

1407
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,760
In God's name, what
are you talking about?

1408
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:52,560
It wasn't like she
didn't give him reason.

1409
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:58,400
- George, for Christ's sake!
- And when we realised...

1410
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,600
...she was fucking everybody...

1411
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:09,880
...from Bill Kent to Jake Elby,
it was too late for official action.

1412
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:11,880
Colonel Fowler!

1413
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,280
You'd have to ask for
all their resignations.

1414
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:20,040
- Strangulation, you think?
- And then resign ourselves.

1415
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:25,760
You need civilian authority.
What happened to you?

1416
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:33,480
- You had no other choice, sir.
- You think I killed my own daughter?

1417
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:39,560
- It'll die with me, Joe.
- You sorry son of a bitch!

1418
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,640
- Bill, where's Moore?
- He was released.

1419
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:44,440
Oh, my God...

1420
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:49,340
Seaver...

1421
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,920
- Cal, it's me.
- You arrest Fowler?

1422
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,000
No, let me speak to Sunhill.

1423
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:53,880
She's not here.

1424
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,280
She got in an hour ago.

1425
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,080
Then said she was going back
out to the crime scene.

1426
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,280
She go out there, alone?

1427
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:02,680
Sir, she took the big dog with her.
Capt. America himself.

1428
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:07,400
Kent. It was his idea. He wants
you to meet him out there.

1429
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,900
Of course he does.

1430
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:27,500
Sunhill!

1431
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:36,480
Bill, we've been through this
place, a dozen times before.

1432
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,280
We're not gonna get
anything else out of this.

1433
01:40:45,460 --> 01:40:45,760
Paul?

1434
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:48,720
Sure, sure...

1435
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:49,800
Paul...

1436
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,520
Think the three of us need to go back
to your office and talk.

1437
01:40:58,160 --> 01:40:59,880
I've always been in and out
towards that kind of guy.

1438
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:00,840
Why don't we talk here?

1439
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,320
That is, if we have anything
really important to talk about?

1440
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,160
I thought you'd do your job. Pin it
on Moore then move the fuck on.

1441
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,520
Oh, God.

1442
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:14,360
But I forgot, you were the
nastiest rat in the shithouse.

1443
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:16,600
Just goes to show you.

1444
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:17,840
Why did you do it?

1445
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:23,200
Why?
You tell me, you're the expert.

1446
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,760
I think this is a woman...

1447
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:29,280
Giving it out all over the post to
the one man who cared about her,

1448
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:31,520
The one who's willing
to risk it all for her,

1449
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,000
is the person she doesn't want.

1450
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,000
And that's because
she couldn't want anybody.

1451
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,760
See, I just wanted to
be with her, forever.

1452
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:48,480
She owned my heart.

1453
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:54,280
She tormented me.
She became my obsession.

1454
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:01,600
So I followed her, and found her
out there on the range.

1455
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:03,080
On display.

1456
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,000
Elisabeth?

1457
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:09,320
Get outta here, Bill.
Get the fuck outta here.

1458
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:12,360
He'll come back.
I know he will.

1459
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,160
You can't be around.
You'll ruin it all.

1460
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,240
- What are you doin' out here?
- What's all this about?

1461
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:20,840
My father send you.
Is that why you're here?

1462
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:21,400
No.

1463
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,480
- Did he send you to shut me up?
- No.

1464
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:26,280
No...

1465
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:29,440
Well, this time I won't be quiet.

1466
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,560
This time I will tell everything.

1467
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:36,080
About him, about you.
I'll tell your wife...

1468
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,120
And I'll tell your kids...

1469
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,120
Don't touch me!
Get your hands off me!

1470
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,720
You repulse me! You're a disgrace!

1471
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:58,320
You're not a soldier. You're not
even a man. You're just a fuck.

1472
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:00,120
I fucked you!

1473
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:09,720
Oh, Christ!

1474
01:43:29,780 --> 01:43:31,160
C'mon, Bill, let's get going.

1475
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:33,040
Come on.

1476
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:41,040
I'm all yours, Paulie.

1477
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:41,800
Whoa!

1478
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,240
Before you come closer,

1479
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,760
don't you want to know
where you're standing?

1480
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,477
- Where am I standing?
- In a minefield.

1481
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:52,080
Ah, c'mon, Bill.

1482
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:55,600
I buried some Bouncing Betties.
Anti-personnel.

1483
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:57,500
Bye, then.

1484
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,000
Oh, you're reasonably safe here, Paul.

1485
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,100
but little Miss Can't-be-Wrong
over there...

1486
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:05,200
She's deep in the hurt locker.

1487
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,200
You remember
how the Betty works?

1488
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,560
First man trips the primary,
mine shoots up,

1489
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:13,400
the rest of the column
walks into the blast.

1490
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,080
Heads are removed,
or limbs, whatever...

1491
01:44:16,740 --> 01:44:18,240
Backtrack the
way you came.

1492
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:20,880
You know it's amazing,

1493
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,720
what a load of shrapnel
do to flesh and bone...

1494
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,920
- Sarah, you're fine.
- God!

1495
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,000
Bang!

1496
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:32,800
Scared you, didn't I?

1497
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:35,040
You're an asshole, Kent!

1498
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:37,320
Come on, Bill, it's over.

1499
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:41,160
Yeah, it's over.

1500
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,280
But not the way you think.

1501
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:18,800
Detail, attention!

1502
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,680
Present arms!

1503
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:32,680
The human eye can distinguish
sixteen shades of grey.

1504
01:45:33,380 --> 01:45:36,040
A computer image processor,
analyzing a fingerprint,

1505
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:41,160
can distinguish 256 shades
of grey, which is impressive.

1506
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:44,400
The human heart,
mind and soul, however,

1507
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:49,680
can distinguish an infinite number of
emotional, psychological and moral shadings.

1508
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:54,200
In Psy Ops we deal with the blackest
of black and the whitest of white.

1509
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:02,240
At ease, soldier.

1510
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:11,520
Is Col. Fowler coming?

1511
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:14,440
No, he's taking some much-needed R&R.

1512
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:16,520
He's a good man, George.

1513
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,200
A good man and a good soldier.

1514
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:23,560
Sometimes the lines
get a little blurred but,

1515
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,920
but when push comes to shove...

1516
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:29,440
- He'll do what needs to be done.
- And what is that, sir?

1517
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:36,240
Say Moore called him,of course.
And that I was never out there...

1518
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:38,520
He'll do that for me,

1519
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:41,240
even if it means his career.

1520
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:43,280
Like a good soldier.

1521
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,920
Nothing is gained
by my involvement.

1522
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:52,680
A letter of commendation
will be inserted into your file.

1523
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:57,840
In recognition of your
exemplary work on this case.

1524
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,640
Remember when I asked you
if you were a cop or a soldier?

1525
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:10,400
Yes, sir.

1526
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:11,920
Well...

1527
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:14,280
You're a soldier, Paul.

1528
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:18,200
And a damn fine one.

1529
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:29,240
General Campbell...

1530
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:35,720
- You're wrong. I'm a rotten soldier.
- Oh? And why is that?

1531
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:37,440
You really don't get it, do you?

1532
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:42,600
The only mind Elisabeth wanted
to fuck with was yours.

1533
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:47,240
And you still don't get it.

1534
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:50,600
I've done nothing wrong.

1535
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:54,800
You killed her.

1536
01:47:58,220 --> 01:47:59,080
What did you say?

1537
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:02,480
Seven years ago,
in that hospital room.

1538
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:06,360
When you told her to just
forget about it, you killed her.

1539
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,320
Kent killed her.

1540
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:13,480
No. Kent just put her
out of her misery.

1541
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,320
I once asked Moore what
was worse than rape.

1542
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:19,920
Now, I know.

1543
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:22,260
Betrayal.

1544
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:25,200
I loved Elisabeth,

1545
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,840
but there were larger
issues to consider.

1546
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,440
You traded her trust
for your career.

1547
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,560
You made a deal,
didn't you?

1548
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,880
You kept silent, and they
gave you another star.

1549
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,600
You watch your
mouth, Brenner.

1550
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:40,920
I'm gonna say
that in my report.

1551
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,240
That you knew she was out there,
then you went out and talked to her,

1552
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:44,280
and left her out there to die.

1553
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:51,520
- You don't have the balls.
- Oh, you're wrong, sir.

1554
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,280
Because that's just about all I have left.

1555
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,320
You do that, you can kiss
your career goodbye.

1556
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:01,000
I'm gonna have you
court-martialled, General.

1557
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:04,440
Under Article 32 for conspiracy
to conceal a crime.

1558
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:43,240
When this all started, I told you that
we would find the son of a bitch, sir.

1559
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:48,320
I never expected that the
son of a bitch would be you.
