1
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,169
Come to us.

2
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:47,905
Join us.

3
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,502
Hear that, Spike?
Lady Luck's calling your name.

4
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,371
Big pot here.
You in or out?

5
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,574
I'm tapped.
I can't cover the bet.

6
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:48,744
Well make an exception.
The pink slip on your Harley.

7
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:51,013
What do you say, boys ?
Hmm? All right?

8
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,316
Its okay with me, man.

9
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:56,653
You in or out?

10
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,654
What do you say?

11
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:01,759
Im in.

12
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:03,027
What do you got?

13
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:09,534
Look. Full boat.

14
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:12,071
Yeah, thats a battle ship, dude.

15
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:14,607
Read em and weep, Johnson.

16
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:15,975
Thats luck, Spike.

17
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:21,982
Fuck off, Marcus.

18
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:26,521
Bring the pink slip
by my office tomorrow.

19
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:30,659
Not if I can come up
with the cash by tomorrow.

20
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,761
And if by chance you do repent...

21
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:35,264
and if by chance
the Lord hears your words...

22
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:37,567
then you shall receive
the bounty of the Lord...

23
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,303
for he surely works
in mysterious ways.

24
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,273
Witness, if you will,
the miracle of Christ...

25
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,476
and the loaves of bread
and baskets of fish...

26
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,278
in the kingdom of Herod.

27
00:03:47,345 --> 00:03:49,280
Open your Bibles now,
brothers and sisters...

28
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:51,683
to Matthew, chapter 14.

29
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,986
"And at that time,
Herod the tetrarch...

30
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:57,089
heard of the fame ofJesus..."

31
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:58,691
Not on the couch!

32
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:02,562
Hoax Arthur Wilmoth, you better not
be eating on my sofa, boy!

33
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,298
Im not, Mama.

34
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:13,875
On down. Down, down.

35
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,145
Mamas gonna put the tray down.
Down, down.

36
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,750
Oh, my! You better not
be takin to lyin, boy.

37
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:22,051
Look at that.

38
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:25,522
Whered you learn that trick from?
From your cousin Spike?

39
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,125
- No, maam.
- SweetJesus!

40
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:31,095
Oh, hallelujah, Reverend.
Look at the hair on him.

41
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,299
"And she, being before
instructed of her mother, said..."

42
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:36,234
What are you lookin at?

43
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,407
You know, when you get your eyeballs
popped back into your head, boy...

44
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:43,743
then why dont you have some of this
nice tea I made for you, okay?

45
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,546
You want me to bring it out?
Dont "mm-mm-mm me.

46
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:50,651
Dont you even think about it.

47
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:58,095
Thats another rock 'n'roll classic
on Garden Citys oldies station.

48
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:01,299
Hey, I guess you've noticed a little
atmospheric disturbance tonight.

49
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:04,736
Storm clouds are gathering with possible
thundershowers tonight and tomorrow.

50
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,705
Now for the latest
local football scores.

51
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:09,609
The Garden City Wildcats...

52
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:11,511
Out of the darkness
and into the light...

53
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:14,881
comes your horrorscope
on this dark and stormy night.

54
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:20,688
Push "666"for your horrorscope now.

55
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,296
Welcome to the Caverns of the Unknown.

56
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:29,865
I am the Master of the Dark...

57
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:33,002
the guide to your destiny on...

58
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,405
November 28, 1988.

59
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:38,275
Financial debts linger,
but not for long.

60
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:41,312
You have the urge to take risks.
Don't be afraid.

61
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:45,250
Your prize lies
only a short distance away.

62
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:46,718
Claim it.

63
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:10,913
Oh, fucking cat!

64
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,715
Spike!

65
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,352
What in the name of St. Peter...

66
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,789
do you think
that you are doin, boy?

67
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,725
Thou shall not steal!

68
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,562
Thou shall not steal!
Its number eight in the Good Book!

69
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:58,568
Get your butt upstairs,
or Im gonna get my strap out, boy.

70
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:01,605
- Out, out, out!
- Dont you think hes too old for that?

71
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,244
How dare you?

72
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:10,281
How dare you tell me
how to raise my baby boy?

73
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:13,351
Thats where my sister,
God rest her soul...

74
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,687
Thats where she made her mistake
with you. There was no discipline.

75
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:18,090
You know that? There wasn't.
No discipline.

76
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:21,494
First there was the motorcycle,
then failing in school...

77
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,563
and then staying out all night.

78
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,333
Now its stealin.
I catch you stealin.

79
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,838
Listen, Lucy, Im only taking
what is rightfully mine.

80
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:34,276
You have no claim to that money
until you are 21 years old, boy.

81
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:36,311
You know that as well as I do,
and until that time...

82
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:39,215
I will use that money
as I see fit.

83
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:42,385
- Just empty your pockets, boy.
- Get your strap out and make me!

84
00:08:43,753 --> 00:08:46,590
How dare you speak to me
like that, boy?

85
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:48,058
How dare you?

86
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:51,829
Godll get you for this...

87
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:55,300
you evil, insubordinate
little bastard.

88
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,873
- Were not finished yet!
- Go to hell!

89
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:04,577
You can still change, boy.
There is still time to repent.

90
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,081
Oh, if only you could see things
the way that I do.

91
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:10,784
Just look up to heaven and ask the Lord
to show you the way, boy.

92
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,487
- Thats what you do.
- Mama, its raining fish!

93
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,690
Its raining fish from the sky!

94
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:28,438
Oh, Holy Son of God!

95
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,743
These are Gods fishes!

96
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,912
God is speaking to me...

97
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:38,550
and he tells me to open my eyes
and lead you to redemption!

98
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,385
You hear me, boy?

99
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:43,889
Theres still time.
The glor of the Lord!

100
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:45,091
Jesus Christ.

101
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:52,132
When it rains, it pours.

102
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:54,134
You're not in debt anymore.

103
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:37,651
Whatever it is that youre selling,
young man, Im not interested.

104
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,457
Marty Palmer,
Modern Miracle magazine.

105
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:45,093
Im looking for Lucy Wilmoth.

106
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,763
Well, for heavens sake.
And you found her.

107
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:55,572
Please stop!

108
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:57,708
How about a drink, Hoax?

109
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,444
Oh, Hoax, whats the matter?

110
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:04,682
Come here. Hey, shut up,
all right? Im talkin.

111
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:06,384
Hey, were just
havin some fun, man.

112
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:08,787
Ease up!
All right, give me a dollar.

113
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,823
Okay, dont forget, ever
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

114
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,125
You can eat lunch
the other two days, okay?

115
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:16,296
Dont pout. Im doin you a favor.
A real big favor, huh?

116
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:17,864
Hit it.

117
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:19,299
Hey, Chubs.

118
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:24,038
Cute kid, huh?

119
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:27,709
Spike, your cousin tells me youre gonna
be eatin seafood for a few months.

120
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:29,711
Why dont you come by
and pick some up?

121
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,380
I hear its real brain food.

122
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:37,053
Let's get to the business at hand.
You see this cash?

123
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:39,255
Gonna buy me a motorcycle jacket
just like the one youre wearing.

124
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:41,458
Youll look pretty stupid
wearing it at a bus stop.

125
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:43,761
Say what?

126
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:46,264
I said youll look real stupid
wearing it at a bus stop.

127
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:47,865
What do you mean?

128
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:51,603
Well, well.

129
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,539
What happened?
You rob a liquor store?

130
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:58,711
- Whats up, homeboy?
- Let him go.

131
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:00,981
Since when did you
start sticking up for Hoax?

132
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:02,582
Shut up and back off, Skinhead.

133
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,251
The names Airhead.

134
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:09,958
Spike, why dont you cool down, man!
A toilet shampoo never hurt anybody!

135
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:12,193
Motherfucker!

136
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:19,669
I think he broke my nose.

137
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,075
You okay?

138
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,547
I knew youd show up, Spike.

139
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,616
Let's kick these assholes
into tomorrow.

140
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:34,052
Why dont you do that?
I gotta go to biology.

141
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,892
Hey, why did you leave?

142
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,962
We couldve taken those guys.

143
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,131
Were a team, Spike.

144
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,968
I thought I told you
not to tell anybody about last night.

145
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,004
Oh, I only told Marcus
so that hed leave me alone.

146
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,505
What are you talking about?

147
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,476
Well, Mama said we were blessed
by the Lord last night.

148
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,245
Thought it was only fair to warn them.

149
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:59,782
Well, look, unless the Lord
is gonna go to the head with you...

150
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:01,550
you better stay out of there
till you can handle yourself.

151
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:09,459
The skies began to rumble.

152
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:16,634
Then the will of God
showered down upon us...

153
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:18,370
raining his fish.

154
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:20,305
His fish.

155
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,576
Ill pick you up over at the gym
at 7:00 tonight.

156
00:13:25,411 --> 00:13:26,613
We got a date.

157
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,351
Spike, hear my muffer?

158
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:35,790
It sounds just like yours now.

159
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,959
I punched it out
in metal shop today, you know?

160
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:41,029
Look, Im busy, Hoax.

161
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:43,399
- Who is that guy?
- I was thinking we might race home.

162
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:47,670
Spike and me are gonna take a trip
across countr on bikes this summer...

163
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,038
if my mama let's me.

164
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,943
His mama? Sorr, sorr.

165
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,746
You know,
if you had a friend...

166
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,482
we certainly
would be more comfortable...

167
00:13:57,515 --> 00:13:59,517
with a couple of babes
riding on the back.

168
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,956
Babes. Get him a babe.
Ill see you at 7:00.

169
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:05,291
Ill be there.

00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,437
Hey, Spike, wait up!

171
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,406

172
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,368
Damn it!

173
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:31,156
I thought we had a deal.

174
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,058
I told you no!

175
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,228
A deal is a deal.

176
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,798
Leave me alone, please!
Please!

177
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:40,834
Please pay for your calls now.

178
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,317
What time do they roll
the sidewalks up around here?

179
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,887
You ready to order?

180
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:29,357
Could you give me a few more minutes
and get me a cup of coffee?

181
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,925
Such a wide selection.

182
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:01,060
- Hey, Virg?
- Yo.

183
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,595
You get that part?

184
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:07,067
My kids bringing it
in 15 minutes, Spike.

185
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:11,372
You know its a bitch getting
an original mirror for a 48 Harley?

186
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,040
Its worth it
for your dads old bike, though.

187
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:22,752
- How much are these?
- Those?

188
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:23,986
Twenty bucks.

189
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:25,455
Theyre real leather.

190
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:30,327
- Ill be outside.
- Okay.

191
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:56,524
Push "666"
for your horrorscope now.

192
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:00,595
Welcome to
the Caverns of the Unknown.

193
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:04,600
I am the Master of the Dark,
the guide to your destiny on...

194
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,737
November 29, 1988.

195
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:11,942
A real man has the nerves
to take what he deserves.

196
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:08,040
A real man has the nerves
to take what he deserves.

197
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,575
What is this bullshit?

198
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,243
A real man has the nerves...

199
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,645
Fuck you!

200
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:18,251
Your horrorscope
on November 29, 1988.

201
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,555
Look both ways
before crossing the street.

202
00:19:21,622 --> 00:19:22,890
Fuck you!

203
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,715
Thanks. I owe you one.

204
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,019
I guess this is for you.
Maybe somebody left it by mistake.

205
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:19,822
Whatll you have?

206
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:21,858
Ill have a western omelette, please.

207
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:24,828
The usual for me.

208
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:28,332
One western
and a deviled egg sand.

209
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:34,539
I talked to your aunt today.

210
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,445
Fish dont fall
from the sky ever night, though.

211
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:44,351
Youre not gonna make this
easy for me, are you?

212
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:55,831
- I didnt think you were gonna show up.
- Get on.

213
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,634
- Feel safe?
- Yes, I feel safe.

214
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,770
- Hang on.
- Go!

215
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:03,873
- You need a helmet?
- No, I dont need a helmet.

216
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,877
Oh, my God! Slow down!

217
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:12,252
I hear something.
What is that?

218
00:22:17,324 --> 00:22:18,225
What is that?

219
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:42,921
Who is this?

220
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:45,056
Its all right.
Its just my cousin.

221
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:46,391
Oh, my God.

222
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:52,832
What a creep, man!
What kind ofsicko is he?

223
00:22:52,899 --> 00:22:54,768
You should meet his mother.

224
00:22:57,271 --> 00:22:59,473
- You got a light?
- Its in my jacket pocket.

225
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:08,016
Lets get out of here.

226
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:08,951
Wait.

227
00:23:10,986 --> 00:23:12,755
Here.

228
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:14,357
And what are these for?

229
00:23:14,424 --> 00:23:17,594
I dont know. I guess
Im giving you reason to come back.

230
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:21,298
You dont need a reason
to come back.

231
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,435
What are you gonna wear?

232
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,909
These.

233
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:39,820
- Are you ready for this?
- Uh-huh.

234
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:45,960
How does it look?

235
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:14,726
Thank you, maam.

236
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,005
Oh, Spike!

237
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,176
Why dont you go in
and find us some seats?

238
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:30,678
Ill be right back.

239
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:32,714
Five minutes. I promise.

240
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:39,555
All right, hang tight, guys.

241
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:44,661

243
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:52,737
Well, look who it is!
Glad you could join us, Leonard.

244
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:58,744
Hey, dude, you bring
your pink slip, homeboy?

245
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,583
- Whats this for?
- Dont eat it, schmuck.

246
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:16,464
Out of the darkness
and into the light...

247
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:19,468
comes your horrorscope
on this dark and stormy night.

248
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,304
Oh, brother!

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,094
Im not gonna sit downstairs all night

270
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:12,665
You gotta understand.

272
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:20,808
Im sorr.
Some date this turned out to be.

273
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:23,077
Who said anything about a date?

274
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,245
I did.

275
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:38,228
You think youre so cute.

276
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:49,207
Oh, my God, man!
You scared me!

277
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:53,646

Oh, yeah.

283
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:12,868
Hoax. Hoax Wilmoth.

284
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:15,437
Spikes cousin.

285
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,941
I dont want anything

286
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:21,277
- Hey, where are you going?

287
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:23,413

Hey, want me to put a quarter

291
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:57,553
Do you need a quarter?

292
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:00,923
Oh, hey, yeah. Ill pay you back

293
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,327
- Heres two.
- Oh, wow!

294
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:12,169
Take a bite.

295
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,061
This was taken right before
I got kicked out of Catholic school.

296
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:37,966
- Oh, neat.
- I was pretty wild back then.

297
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:39,935
You were? Oh, wow.

298
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,152
So anyay, next morning
she goes out to the barn...

299
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:56,854
starts milkin the cow.

300
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,824
Then the darn thing
turns around and says...

301
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:01,727
"Hey, Id know
those fingers anyhere.

302
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:11,538
Well, gentlemen, you know
Id love to stay and chat...

303
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:13,440
but you know poker etiquette.

304
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:21,349
How come you dont smoke?

305
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:23,051
My mama wouldnt approve.

306
00:30:24,152 --> 00:30:25,788
- Oh, my God! Theres a spider!
- What is it?

307
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:27,022
Get it away!

308
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:28,291
Oh, gross!

309
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:30,894
Suzie, its only a daddy longlegs.

310
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,296
You know, they dont even
consider it a spider...

311
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:35,532
even though
its in the arachnid family.

312
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,635
Hey, you know, you should see
the one I have at home.

313
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:40,838
A gray hermit. Now, theres
a poisonous spider for you.

314
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,775
- Ew, its so gross!
- Hey, you wanna hold him?

315
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,979
No, I dont want to hold it!
Please, Hoax, kill it.

316
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,418
Come on, boy.
Let's go outside.

317
00:30:54,454 --> 00:30:57,624
Im gonna let you go outside so
you can play with your little friends.

318
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:01,629
See you later, little guy.

319
00:31:10,873 --> 00:31:12,575
Whats up, Chuck?

320
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:18,015
Yo, girl, whats up?

321
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:22,553
Listen, you... you barracudas.

322
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:24,989
- Hey, guys, leave him alone.
- Why dont you just leave us alone?

323
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:27,525
Gee, Hoax, Im sorr.

324
00:31:29,661 --> 00:31:31,263
Let him go!

325
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,299
Its okay, Suzie.

326
00:31:33,366 --> 00:31:35,635
Let's just pay the bill
and get out of here.

327
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:37,437
Give us a kiss.

328
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:40,974
Hey, whats in your pocket, homeboy?

329
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,345
Oh, look what we have here.

330
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:46,447
Whose are these, huh?

331
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:49,384
Theyre mine! Give em here.
Give em here!

332
00:31:50,886 --> 00:31:52,855
Oh, shit!

333
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,990
- Get away!
- You fucking bitch!

334
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:56,659
I thought you were different.

335
00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:00,897
Oh, he is. No question.

336
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:04,835
Howd you get her underear?
Huh? You little fucking perert.

337
00:32:04,902 --> 00:32:06,604
Hey, Suzie!

338
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:07,839
Take care of him.

339
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:53,491
Don't worry about others
who damage your pride.

340
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:56,695
They'll soon regret it
when shes by your side.

341
00:32:58,931 --> 00:33:01,701
I am the truth.
The others tell lies.

342
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:06,440
Call me back later
to capture your prize.

343
00:33:25,094 --> 00:33:27,764
Jesus wants you
to spread the word. I want...

344
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,300
Small circle of salt
and star within.

345
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:32,737
Adding one insect
will punish her sin.

346
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,806
The juice of my weed
will implant my seed...

347
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:36,908
and make you one of my kin.

348
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,462
Were gonna scare
the shit outta her.

349
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,236
Some of Mamas devils root.

350
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,385
You like my mamas tea?

351
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:15,021
Shes all yours, Hoax.

352
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:46,858
Poison, poison, poison.

353
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,485
Oh, my God!
Get em off of me!

354
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,288
Oh, my God.

355
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,895
Stop it! Stop it!

356
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:58,040
Boy, do you know what time it is?

357
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:00,743
Why arent you in bed?

358
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:03,646
Dont you ever knock
before entering?

359
00:37:03,713 --> 00:37:06,016
Dont you get testy
with me, boy.

360
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:08,786
You know what this is
I got in my hand?

361
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,222
Do you have any idea what this
paper with the blue writin is?

362
00:37:11,288 --> 00:37:12,990
It is the telephone bill.

363
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:15,059
I have been tring to call in
a pledge all night...

364
00:37:15,126 --> 00:37:17,729
but it is rather difficult
with you monopolizin the phone, boy.

365
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:19,631
Now tell me,
what have you done?

366
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:21,801
I know what this is.
This is Satans work.

367
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,469
I recognize it.
It is Satans work...

368
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:27,374
listening to filthy,
sick sex talk at your age!

369
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,045
Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

370
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:32,179
Mom, it...

371
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:36,117
- Speak to me, boy.
- It was Spike.

372
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:39,721
Spike called, Mama.

373
00:37:39,788 --> 00:37:41,924
Not me. It was Spike, I swear.

374
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:44,160
Dont you give that to me, boy.
Dont you dare...

375
00:37:45,294 --> 00:37:46,262
give that to me.

376
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:48,565
He has his own telephone.
I know that as well as you do.

377
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:51,635
But theres no question in my mind
that he led you on to this.

378
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,138
That evil, sinning pagan.

379
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,741
Watch me. Im gonna put a stop
to it right now. You watch me.

380
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,210
Watch what Im doing.
Watch what your mamas doing.

381
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,281
Now, you just get to bed.

382
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,183
Im knockin at your door now.

383
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:14,261
You shouldnt
have done that, Mama.

384
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,665
You shouldnt have done that.

385
00:38:22,738 --> 00:38:25,474
Hello. Im Angella Martinez.
You wanted to see me?

386
00:38:29,812 --> 00:38:32,182
Yeah. Marty Palmer, P.I.

387
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:34,117
- Id like to speak to a student.
- Which one?

388
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:36,520
Leonard Johnson.
The kids call him Spike.

389
00:38:36,553 --> 00:38:38,389
Is he in some kind of trouble?

390
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:39,991
Well, he might be.

391
00:38:41,392 --> 00:38:43,995
All right.
You have five minutes.

392
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:47,266
I see why you come here.

393
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:02,917
- Im so glad I found you.
- Cutting class?

394
00:39:02,984 --> 00:39:05,086
That guy from the magazine
is here at school looking for you.

395
00:39:05,153 --> 00:39:07,522
I heard him talking to Miss Martinez
a few minutes ago in the office.

396
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:09,925
- About what?
- I dont know.

397
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:12,261
Want me to take care of him
for you, though?

398
00:39:12,328 --> 00:39:14,430
No, Hoax.
I can handle my own problems.

399
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:17,100
Yeah? Like you did
with Suzie last night, huh?

400
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:19,670
All right, your mouths running.
Get lost.

401
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:23,241
You dont think I can do it? You think
Im some kind of wimp, dont you?

402
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:26,311
Ill take care of him like I did
with your chick last night.

403
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:28,313
What are you talking about, Hoax?

404
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,218
What are you talking about, Hoax?

405
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:36,589
It was an accident.

406
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:39,025
I only meant to scare her,
Spike, I swear.

407
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:43,531
All right, look, asshole.

408
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,836
Start talking!
No bullshit!

409
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:53,509
You start talking, and dont stop
until youve told me everthing.

410
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,516
I killed her.

411
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:02,352
I killed her, Spike.

412
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:04,755
I used my spider.

413
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:09,461
What did you do, you stupid kid?

414
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:11,830
I called this guy on the phone.

415
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:13,966
He told me what to do.

416
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:16,068
I did it for you, Spike!

417
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:17,804
Dont you see?

418
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,473
She was messing up
your reputation.

419
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,509
She was out with Marcus
that night.

420
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:26,981
She was a dirtyJezebel whore,
and I took care of her for you.

421
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:28,783
No!

422
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:30,985
You think youre cool...

423
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:33,488
because youre bigger,
because youre stronger than me.

424
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:39,562
Come on. Hit me!

425
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:42,432
Just you wait.

426
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:46,003
Its gonna be different
from now on.

427
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:49,941
Someday soon, youre gonna be
down here, and Im gonna spit on you.

428
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:51,709
When hell freezes over, asshole.

429
00:40:57,416 --> 00:40:59,952
Shit! Get out of here!

430
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:30,587
Operator 13. What city?

431
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,825
- Garden City, please.
- Is this a business or a residence?

432
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,828
I would like the business address
for a 976 number, please.

433
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:45,304
Sorr, pal. Now, my picks
for the third race are...

434
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:47,440
Deadly Nightshade,
Devils Moon and Mothers Curse.

435
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:49,242
For the fourth race,
Merlins Hex...

436
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:51,178
Dark Omen and Belladonna.

437
00:41:51,245 --> 00:41:53,347
Look, you called me, okay?

438
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:54,949
Thats right, buddy.

439
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:57,652
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

440
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:01,924
Hello, little girl, this is Santa.
Have you been a good little girl?

441
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,792
What do you want for Christmas?

442
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,596
Im a petite
17-year-old nymphet...

443
00:42:06,662 --> 00:42:09,065
with desires
most men cant satisf.

444
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,737
Whos standing in front of me,
naked in the confessional?

445
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:18,209
Father Riley. I didnt know
you could do that with an icon.

446
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:24,016
May I help you?

447
00:42:25,517 --> 00:42:27,820
Yeah. Im looking
for Mark Dark.

448
00:42:27,887 --> 00:42:29,055
Follow me.

449
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:31,424
Sit down.

450
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:45,641
So, Mr. Palmer...

451
00:42:46,742 --> 00:42:48,277
what is it exactly
that I can do for you?

452
00:42:48,344 --> 00:42:50,446
Well, your horrorscope thing.

453
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,649
This is my pet project,
my baby.

454
00:42:58,222 --> 00:42:59,223
There it is.

455
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,262
You dont have a real operator?

456
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,867
You see, this was an experiment.

457
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:11,437
I was gonna lay people off.
Save money on benefits and everthing.

458
00:43:13,406 --> 00:43:14,941
I built this myself.

459
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:17,344
I used to live in Radio Shack
when I was in high school.

460
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:20,014
But it didnt work out.

461
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,482
It was using up more money
in electricity...

462
00:43:21,549 --> 00:43:23,718
than I was making in calls,
so I shut it off.

463
00:43:23,785 --> 00:43:25,053
Simple economics.

464
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:28,724
How long ago did you shut it off?

465
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:31,126
Let's see.

466
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:33,529
Two, three months, I guess.

467
00:43:34,597 --> 00:43:36,166
I guess nobodys interested
in the underorld anymore.

468
00:43:36,232 --> 00:43:38,168
You know, just Ewoks and E. T...

469
00:43:38,235 --> 00:43:40,337
and football and phone sex.

470
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,939
I hate that heavy-breathing crap.

471
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:48,613
What do you thinks happening
in the US today?

472
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:52,851
I mean, a guy
cant make a buck anymore.

473
00:43:59,192 --> 00:44:00,794
That is so gross.
I dont believe it.

474
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:03,697
- Hey, you like frog legs?
- Oh, gross me out.

475
00:44:04,565 --> 00:44:06,100
Did you get the answer
for number 14?

476
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:31,496
Mr. Michaels,
may I please be excused?

477
00:44:31,563 --> 00:44:33,932
Whats the matter, Mr. Wilmoth?
Feeling a little green around the gills?

478
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,002

"Raining fish?

512
00:48:16,856 --> 00:48:18,691
Some say its a warning from God.

513
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:21,995
Spikes aunt thinks that he
was tring to tell her something.

514
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:23,597
A warning about what?

515
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:25,499
I dont understand.

516
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,335

517
00:48:28,836 --> 00:48:30,839

00:48:36,912 --> 00:48:37,980
Amen.

522
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:40,950
Look at my little greedy cats eatin up.

526
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:49,160

Put that phone back.

529
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,243
If you value your life,
I suggest you leave me alone.

530
00:50:08,017 --> 00:50:10,353
- Do you want the power now?
- Yes.

531
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:12,823
Are you ready?

532
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,158

Then... take it!

537
00:51:18,332 --> 00:51:19,867
You're too late, Palmer.

538
00:51:23,137 --> 00:51:25,006
Hey, can I call you Marty?

539
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,344
That his masters wife
cast her eye uponJoseph.

540
00:51:29,411 --> 00:51:31,147
Yes, she did, brother and sisters.
Praise the Lord!

541
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,784
She cast her eyes uponJoseph,
and she said, "Lie with me."

542
00:51:41,992 --> 00:51:43,961
- Marty, whats wrong?

00:52:13,395 --> 00:52:15,831
Yeah, dude.
Its the slasher himself.

557
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:17,934
Its a little late
to be wearing sunglasses.

558
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,669
Or is there a full moon out?

559
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,571
Take him outside

Got aces and eights.
Dead mans hand.

01:04:32,547 --> 01:04:33,816
Oh, my God.

642
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:47,498
Whats the matter?

643
01:04:48,466 --> 01:04:49,801
Cat got your tongue?

644
01:04:53,672 --> 01:04:56,475
Did you have
a nice meeting with my mama?

645
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:00,413
She makes lovely
dinner conversation, doesnt she?

646
01:05:02,882 --> 01:05:04,050
Oh, baby.

647
01:05:07,421 --> 01:05:09,924
My cousin didnt think it would
get this far, but it has.

648
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,295
- Wheres Hoax?
- Inside. Hes got Angella.

649
01:06:15,132 --> 01:06:16,300
Get away from me!

650
01:06:28,548 --> 01:06:29,482
Angella!

651
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:41,496
Just in time
for my little party.

652
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,501
- Get her out of here!
- Come on. Youll be all right.

653
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,838
Welcome to my house, cousin.

654
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:53,176
Dont you think its time
we ended this, Hoax?

655
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:56,046
Little bit further.

656
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:01,386
Going so soon?
But you just got here!

657
01:07:04,756 --> 01:07:06,325
Now, you, buster...

658
01:07:07,493 --> 01:07:10,863
you just dont end this.

659
01:07:15,502 --> 01:07:17,037
Armageddon, cousin.

660
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,975
Armageddon this, cousin.

661
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:23,778
Oh, God!

662
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:27,516
You know...

663
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:29,251
Mama told us...

664
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:31,020
never play with guns!

665
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:41,866
Isnt it ironic, cousin?

666
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,804
You down there...

667
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,138
me up here.

668
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:50,309
Guess what, cousin.

669
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:53,346
Hell finally froze over.

670
01:07:58,618 --> 01:08:00,153
Im right behind you.

671
01:08:07,162 --> 01:08:08,296
Hold on.

672
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:21,411
- Its Hoax.
- Hold on!

673
01:08:24,882 --> 01:08:26,450
Hold on.

674
01:08:26,484 --> 01:08:27,819
Dont fall!

675
01:08:29,888 --> 01:08:32,758
Careful! Hold on now.
Just hold on!

676
01:08:41,234 --> 01:08:42,769
Hoax, you son of a bitch!

677
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,509
Bye-bye!

678
01:08:50,845 --> 01:08:51,913
Burn, bitch, burn!

679
01:08:53,448 --> 01:08:54,750
Just hold on!

680
01:09:03,159 --> 01:09:06,764
- Its gotta stop, Hoax.
- I am growing wear of you, cousin.

681
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:07,965
Go to hell.

682
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,469
Were both going to hell!

683
01:09:16,575 --> 01:09:19,478
If you kill me, Hoax, were never gonna
make that motorcycle trip together.

684
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:21,080
Once youve been to hell...

685
01:09:21,147 --> 01:09:23,016
everthing else
pales in comparison.

686
01:09:24,017 --> 01:09:25,585
And besides, Hoax...

687
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:28,555
God rest his pathetic little soul,
is no longer with us.

688
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,225
Please, listen to me, once!

689
01:09:33,094 --> 01:09:34,729
A motorcycle trip...

690
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,064
trip across countr.

691
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:38,967
I know you can hear me, Hoax.

692
01:09:40,502 --> 01:09:43,272
Well get a couple of babes,
just like you wanted.

693
01:09:44,207 --> 01:09:46,142
Remember our trip?

694
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:47,944
You got to hear me, Hoax.

695
01:09:49,613 --> 01:09:50,781
You got to.

696
01:09:52,216 --> 01:09:54,552
- Trip?
- Yeah.

697
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,557
You wanna ride my bike?
You can ride my bike, if you want to.

698
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:02,428
Youve seen my bike.
Itll be great.

699
01:10:03,462 --> 01:10:04,664
On the open road.

700
01:10:06,599 --> 01:10:07,767
Open road.

701
01:10:09,536 --> 01:10:11,205
- Grand Canyon?
- Grand Canyon.

702
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:12,940
- Painted Desert?
- Painted Desert.

703
01:10:14,075 --> 01:10:15,643
The Mississippi?

704
01:10:18,713 --> 01:10:20,015
New Orleans.

705
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,490
Please, Spike.

706
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:30,427
Take me with you.

707
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,863
Hes mine now.
Hes not going anyhere.

708
01:11:11,507 --> 01:11:14,077
Look what I went
and did to you.

709
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:21,986
Hi, my names Tommy
from Memphis, Tennessee...

710
01:11:22,053 --> 01:11:23,588
and I'd like to hear
my horrorscope.

711
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:24,990
Another myster caller.

712
01:11:25,056 --> 01:11:28,894
- Welcome to the Caverns of the Unknown.
- Oh, they love me in Memphis.

713
01:11:28,927 --> 01:11:30,563
I am the Master of the Dark...

714
01:11:30,629 --> 01:11:33,967
- Here it comes, Tommy.
- The guide to your destiny.

715
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,870
Im sure we have something special
in store for you.
