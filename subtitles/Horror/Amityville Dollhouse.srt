1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,928
Yeah. Are you serious ?
Absolutely.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,494
Is she all right ?
I guess.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,698
Jack !

4
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,001
I'm taking him around the park.
He needs to stretch his legs.

5
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,237
All right. I'll see you later.

6
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,143
We won't be long. Be good.

7
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:15,806
Hey, am I ever ?

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,708
Bye.

9
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,013
- Lucky man.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,520
So, someone said there
was gonna be tennis ?

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,454
Is that what I said ?
Because I was pretty sure

12
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,185
I said, "Long Island iced tea."

13
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,692
Wait, wait, there's tea in this ?

14
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,422
We're not playing tennis ?

15
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,589
Because I got this damn
hyper-carbon racket,

16
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,564
or whatever the hell this thing is.

17
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,123
Hey, Jack...

18
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,634
Where's Margaret ?

19
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,814
Addy.

20
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,313
Adelle ?

21
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,178
What's wrong ? You look terrible.

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,516
Margaret, I'm sorry
to be the one to tell you.

23
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,964
You're dead.

24
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,125
Boyd. Hey.

25
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,103
How's the promotion treating you ?

26
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,301
You must be thrilled.
I mean, you were no fun as Echo's Handler

27
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,174
and now you get to be twice as no fun
as head of security.

28
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,680
Yeah, well. So far, not a lot to do.

29
00:01:55,748 --> 00:02:00,151
Miss DeWitt's keeping the Dollhouse idle
for the most part, after Dominic...

30
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,685
- After Dominic.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,984
Most of the Actives are on rest.

32
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,890
Echo's out, though ?

33
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,126
- Yep.
- What is she...

34
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,064
Having trouble letting go, Papa Bear ?

35
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,623
Aw.

36
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,532
We put a dead lady in her.

37
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,163
That's what I heard, but I didn't believe it.

38
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,729
A dead client ?

39
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,743
I guess she's special friends
with Adelle, or something.

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,836
I mean, not special friends.

41
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,476
Although, late night, too much wine...

42
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,911
So we can give you life after death.

43
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,252
Only if we really like you.

44
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,790
Hey, Boyd,

45
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,053
I need an Active.

46
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,959
What ? Why ?

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,797
I'm doing my annual anterior
insular cortex diagnostic,

48
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,028
and though it may sound simple,

49
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,903
it's actually a very complicated,
super-specific imprint

50
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:58,069
and I need head of security
to sign off on a subject.

51
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,239
Is there risk ?

52
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,577
Not if I know what I'm doing.

53
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,114
Sierra's been idle the longest.

54
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,623
Look at you with the big decisions,
big boss-man.

55
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,887
Life after death.

56
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,326
- Where does that end ?
- Same place it begins.

57
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,626
Death.

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,170
This is so stunning.

59
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,037
Really.

60
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,008
Last thing I remember
is coming here a month ago

61
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,568
for that dreadful process of yours.

62
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,773
Well, if we'd spoken in the meantime,

63
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:39,477
I'd have been able to tell you about
the last three weeks of your life, but...

64
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,884
Well, this way I don't have
to remember dying.

65
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,616
Undoubtedly, a plus.

66
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,521
God, it's all a plus.

67
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,552
I mean, more life !

68
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,322
Can you imagine ?

69
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,291
And this body...

70
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,557
Nice work, Addy.

71
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,930
I'm pointing to the sky.

72
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,830
- Shame it's only a loaner.
- That was always the deal.

73
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,372
I swear I've never felt this good.

74
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,239
Did being young feel this good ?

75
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,871
I seem to recall it was rather nice.
I wonder why we gave it up.

76
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,609
Please.
You're, what, 10 years younger than me ?

77
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,174
And, oddly, 15 years older.

78
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,813
Just remember, it's temporary.

79
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,789
Just a chance to indulge my curiosity.

80
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,217
See my own funeral.
Who wouldn't want that ?

81
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,932
To hear what the world
really thought of us ?

82
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,094
To count up the number who love us ?

83
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,432
Addy ?

84
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,868
- Are you all right ?
- Well, let's see.

85
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,309
My friend just died.

86
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,417
Come on.

87
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,749
We've got a funeral to go to.

88
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,789
Then maybe you can help me wrap this up.

89
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,385
Wrap this up ? Your life ?

90
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,588
Well, I thought maybe
I'd solve my murder.

91
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,635
The autopsy said it was
a massive heart attack.

92
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,904
I was perfectly healthy
and ridiculously wealthy.

93
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,105
And wealth can be
a dangerous thing to have.

94
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,512
You suspected this might happen ?

95
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,883
When I was three,

96
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,284
my nanny put ground glass
in my nap-time snack.

97
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,617
She wasn't going to let me eat it.

98
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:28,024
She was going to be the hero
who caught it just in time.

99
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,393
I snuck a cookie and spent
two weeks in the hospital.

100
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,932
Forgive me if I'm the suspicious type.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,697
You had the scan so you could come back
and solve your own murder ?

102
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,163
I like a puzzle.

103
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,366
- Are you certain you're ready for this ?
- Of course.

104
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,273
Come on, let's go in.

105
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,747
I used to say I'd be late for
my own funeral, but I didn't mean it.

106
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,219
Not a bad turnout.

107
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,419
I'd like to hear more weeping, of course.

108
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,724
You know, you don't have
to do that for my benefit,

109
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,320
be all chipper.

110
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,563
Come on, my dear.

111
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,396
I'm doing exactly what you would.

112
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,098
Stiff back, stiff lip.
You know that's how you'd play it.

113
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,670
- Margaret.
- Not Margaret.

114
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,403
I'm Julia now.

115
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,111
You've really thought this through.

116
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,015
I started mentioning Julia now and then
to my family before we started the scans.

117
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,576
I wrote myself into my own will,

118
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,645
instructed the family to expect me...

119
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,021
While you spy on the servants

120
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,322
and the family friends
and the business associates.

121
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,523
A spy ? No, no, Addy. I'm a ghost.

122
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,226
Welcome.

123
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:44,065
We are here to remember
a very special woman.

124
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,336
Margaret Bashford wasn't
the first of that name.

125
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,467
- She was a formidable woman.
- Let me introduce you to the family.

126
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,001
I want to hear
how great you were.

127
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,677
Over there, Nicolas and Jocelyn.

128
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,978
My God.

129
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,576
Your children.

130
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,980
Watching them go through this.

131
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,921
One buries one's parents.

132
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,687
Unpleasant, but natural.

133
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,284
Do let's focus.

134
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,729
Like her namesake, strong...

135
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,859
Oh, my brother William came.

136
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,403
I haven't seen him in a dog's age.

137
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,840
Seems somewhat the worse
for being stupefyingly drunk.

138
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,206
So, no change there.

139
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,940
And lined up along the walls,
the loyal household staff.

140
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,313
The grooms from the stables.

141
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,682
Well, who are all the others ?

142
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,018
You know, all my closest friends.

143
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,217
I should probably remember their names.

144
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,557
Every one of them a suspect.

145
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,357
Ooh, someone's tardy.

146
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:49,960
Jack.

147
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,303
You never met my husband, did you ?

148
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,771
He is young.

149
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,035
Mmm.

150
00:07:56,642 --> 00:08:00,669
When I met him, I stopped becoming
such a regular customer at the Dollhouse.

151
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,338
I can see why.

152
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,178
I was a lucky woman.

153
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,476
Until recently.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,661
Almost there.

155
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,460
Almost there.

156
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,203
Almost...

157
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,043
Yes.

158
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,985
Tell me you got Speedforce 3.

159
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,250
And downloaded the bonus maps.

160
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,622
- Pizza ?
- On its way. Beer in the fridge.

161
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,819
Dude !

162
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,755
Oh ! I've also got this new kind
of Battleship game I invented

163
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,992
with real explosions.

164
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,229
- What, like you can really get hurt ?
- Yeah.

165
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,600
My man.

166
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,662
- Appetizers.
- Word.

167
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:10,182
Get ready to have your ass kicked
and possibly lose an eye.

168
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,147
- You're a better cook than you think.
- Hmm.

169
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,656
I don't think pasta should be that snappy.

170
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,094
It's al dente.
That's Italian for "Ow, my teeth."

171
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,964
Um...

172
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,938
I know the quickest way
to kill a relationship

173
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,442
is to take its temperature,
but are you okay ?

174
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,136
I'm just tired.

175
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,606
Okay.

176
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,575
So, there's nothing new ?
Nothing with work ?

177
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,616
You don't talk about
the Dollhouse much anymore.

178
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,088
No. I don't.

179
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,218
Okay.

180
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,060
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,093
I know I'm being...

182
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,401
I'll be fine.

183
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,364
I'm fine and you're adorable.

184
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,638
You're beyond adorable, you're...

185
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,439
If you say "adorabubble," I'm leaving.

186
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:17,875
I wasn't going to, but I love the fact
you thought it was the next logical word.

187
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,713
- I'll clear.
- No, no, no.

188
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,316
Wow. What a gentleman.

189
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,487
Well, it could also be
I made a mess in the kitchen

190
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,690
and I don't want you to see.

191
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,561
You don't seem like an old friend.

192
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,563
I was backpacking, like the kids do.

193
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,234
She sort of took me under her wing
and showed me Morocco.

194
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,566
Hmm. And you stayed in touch.

195
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,969
She'd call and we'd talk for hours.

196
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,771
We were very close.

197
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:23,741
I think she liked having an outsider
to sort of share her little insights with.

198
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,785
Always gushing about her loved ones.

199
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,650
You know how she was.

200
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,247
What ?

201
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,451
We're talking about
the same woman, right ?

202
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,392
Tall, blonde hair.
- Margaret Merriam Bashford

203
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,952
- from Greenwich...
- Stern look stuck on her face ?

204
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,760
- Mid-50s, liked horses ?
- Yes. Margaret.

205
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,232
I knew her very well.

206
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,500
Mom wasn't exactly a bundle of warmth.

207
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,337
She tended to push people off.

208
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,501
Like a bulldozer.

209
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,274
She did like to befriend complete
strangers for short outbursts,

210
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,282
and have them stay for the weekend
wearing all of my clothes.

211
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,181
- Bulldozer ?
That wasn't a stranger.

212
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,981
That was Camille Beauvais,
the tennis player.

213
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,749
She was a stranger to me,
and she was rude.

214
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,688
She just looked better
in your clothes than you did.

215
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,157
Oh, my God, you slept with her,
didn't you ?

216
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,955
Technically, no, we didn't sleep...

217
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,395
Nicky, just like me
when I was your age.

218
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,559
Wooing all the women
and sort of worthless.

219
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,329
He is not worthless.

220
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,701
Nicolas has loads of potential.

221
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,434
Margaret told me.

222
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,238
It's funny how you not doing anything
was called potential,

223
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,245
and me working my ass off
was called a pipe dream.

224
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,282
This isn't a funeral for
your photography career.

225
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,611
What do you know, Uncle Bill ?

226
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,484
We haven't seen you since Mother
banned you after the boat fiasco.

227
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,885
I was, like, 12.

228
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,584
Yes, Margaret could be awful, but so can I.

229
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,683
And from what I can gauge,
the two of you are hideous.

230
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,285
So, come on.

231
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,091
You should have seen our mother.

232
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,495
Of course, you would have turned to stone.

233
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,965
Margaret was nothing like Mother !

234
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,036
- Your mother.
- You knew Nana ?

235
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,833
Right now we should be drinking...

236
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,635
- I wasn't aware you'd stopped.
...to Margaret.

237
00:12:55,708 --> 00:13:00,475
To the woman she was,
and to all she left behind.

238
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,609
Split three ways.

239
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:08,311
I know Margaret was guarded,
but she did have a soft side.

240
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,482
She fell in love with Jack.

241
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,488
Well, she did like him better
than she liked us, I suppose.

242
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:17,654
She loved you.

243
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,096
I haven't seen much
of Prince Charming.

244
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,361
Deep in grief, I suppose.

245
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,200
Well, after she slapped him down
at long last, he's sulking.

246
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,797
- Slapped him down ?
- She left him the horses.

247
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,364
She knew he didn't know
anything about them,

248
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,536
didn't care about them,
but he got them instead of money.

249
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,842
Don't you think... No.

250
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,608
That's because she treasured
the horses and she trusted him.

251
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,746
Well, I'm glad that she's
not around to see how he's taking that.

252
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,313
What did he expect ?

253
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,790
They were in love.

254
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,555
Julia, I know we're being terribly shocking,

255
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,962
and you're being charmingly loyal,
but you may want to brace yourself.

256
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,433
You may be here to
mourn Margaret Bashford,

257
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,267
but the rest of us, we just live here.

258
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,775
Hey.

259
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,742
Oh, Nicolas. I needed some air.

260
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,619
I think I need to explain
something about tonight.

261
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,458
Mother thought sentiment
made you cloudy.

262
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,255
- Mmm.
- I know we sound harsh,

263
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,426
but she never would've wanted
a bunch of flowery tributes

264
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,469
that people didn't mean.

265
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,899
She was that hard ?

266
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,100
Well, a lot of it was fear.

267
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,144
She was terrified
that we'd have no ambition,

268
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,703
so she made us work for everything.

269
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,908
I like numbers, percentages.

270
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,648
So, she decided I'd work on Wall Street.

271
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,783
Rode me about it every day.

272
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,018
She wouldn't let it lie.

273
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,220
- That's not so...
- I was 12.

274
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,690
She wanted the best for you !

275
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,224
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

276
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:08,137
I'm not trying to lecture you.
I'm trying to comfort you.

277
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,504
You are ?

278
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,603
Inside, she...

279
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,804
She told me that she cried
over all your pains,

280
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,813
and she thought...

281
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,443
She thought all the time
about what it was like

282
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,785
when you were small
and she could hold you and...

283
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,325
And how proud she was

284
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,954
when you grew into this handsome,
confident man.

285
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,194
Are you gonna...

286
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,569
- I don't...
- Yeah ?

287
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,935
- I don't think so.
- You okay ? Want some water ? No ?

288
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,769
- No. I'm okay.
- Okay ?

289
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,469
Well, I mean,
it seemed like you wanted to...

290
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,034
- No.
- Subconsciously ?

291
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,342
- No !
- You said you wanted to comfort me.

292
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,507
Not with my tongue.

293
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,415
You also checked out my body.
I saw that. Oh !

294
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,645
God !

295
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,591
Okay, well,
this is a new personal worst for me.

296
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,559
I'm so sorry. I had too much wine.

297
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,360
Look, I

298
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:07,821
gotta go.

299
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,492
- Okay.
- Yeah.

300
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,908
Oh, hey.

301
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,577
Wrong room, my mistake.

302
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,910
No, wait.

303
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,816
You must be Julia.

304
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,114
Margaret told me about you.

305
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,951
I don't know how I got so turned around.

306
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,323
Well, it's a big place.

307
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,592
Jack,

308
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,398
what Margaret did,

309
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,168
I hope you know it was a gesture of trust.

310
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,701
What... What... What she did ?

311
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,410
Leaving you the horses.

312
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,147
It was her way of saying

313
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,217
she knew you weren't
in this for the money.

314
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,546
Right.

315
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,655
So you get it ?

316
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,157
The horses,

317
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,054
her real loves,

318
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,225
my reward.

319
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,095
Her real... No. That's...

320
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,965
You were with them tonight, weren't you ?

321
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,972
They call me a killer or just a gold digger ?

322
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,905
Killer ? Why would they say that ?

323
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,637
Search me. Inheritance like I got ?

324
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,939
Not exactly worth killing for, is it ?

325
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,887
Addy, it's just so ugly.

326
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,396
I love these people, but I don't like them.

327
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:49,530
<i>What if one of them... God...</i>

328
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,760
Killed you ?

329
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,597
Am I being paranoid ?

330
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,371
<i>You spent a year and a half</i>
<i>having regular painful brain scans</i>

331
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,671
because you thought someone
was going to murder you.

332
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:02,041
So, paranoid is still a contender.

333
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:03,739
I thought it would be a maid.

334
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:04,803
<i>Margaret...</i>

335
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:06,679
<i>Someone who resented my money.</i>

336
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,547
<i>A distant friend, maybe.</i>

337
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,478
God, Adelle, there's just so much anger.

338
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:18,218
At least the first time I died
thinking people loved me.

339
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,525
All just a worthless illusion.

340
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:23,024
Illusions aren't worthless.

341
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,094
They're at the heart of most relationships.

342
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,331
I suppose you'd be out of a job
if they weren't.

343
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:29,702
We'll figure this out.

344
00:18:29,773 --> 00:18:32,799
Of course. I should've stayed dead.

345
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:50,152
Yes ?

346
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:55,854
Eternal life.

347
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:59,258
Nice adjective. Excellent noun.
Is there more ?

348
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:02,901
Is that something we offer now ?

349
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:07,603
Because if it is, that's...

350
00:19:10,113 --> 00:19:13,014
You realize that's the beginning of the end.

351
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:16,912
Life everlasting, it's...
It's the ultimate quest.

352
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:18,454
Christianity, most religion,

353
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:21,150
morality doesn't exist
without the fear of death.

354
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:24,490
I'm not planning on presiding
over the end of Western civilization.

355
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,290
This is a one-time situation.

356
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:29,457
You know that you're asking her
to voluntarily die when the time comes.

357
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,728
Well, if she resists,
I have a new head of security

358
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:34,134
who handles that kind of thing.

359
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:36,904
Yes, ma'am.

360
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,977
You can still help Echo, you know.

361
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,880
Tell me your take on this.

362
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,472
First instinct.

363
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:50,113
- Follow the money.
- That's not easy.

364
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:52,052
It is when the money runs.

365
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,487
I've looked into the horses.

366
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:57,550
One of them, King's Ransom, was
a derby contender not long ago.

367
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,653
So the husband stands to make a bundle.

368
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,664
So does the buyer.

369
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:04,200
I thought I'd send someone
to take a look around the stables.

370
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:07,260
<i>A breeder with a naturally curious streak.</i>

371
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:10,740
Drew Chilton ?

372
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,340
Glad to meet you.
Thanks for coming all the way out here.

373
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:15,776
Well, you've got some fine incentives.

374
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:18,406
Yes, I do. One in particular.

375
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,143
Right this way.

376
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,981
Hope you've been treating him right,
a fine horse like that.

377
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:26,318
Fresh water, fresh oats,
and barbecue on the weekends.

378
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,790
Who among us could ask for more ?

379
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:31,293
So, this place been in your family long ?

380
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:41,399
- Hey.
- Go away.

381
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:44,098
Sure.

382
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:48,438
Wait. I'm... I'm sorry.

383
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,307
I'm just...

384
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,642
God, I'm so emo.

385
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:58,015
Are you ?

386
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:01,847
I have to say,

387
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:07,326
there's a part of me that's not sad
to see someone mourning my friend.

388
00:21:07,397 --> 00:21:09,194
Is that what this is ?

389
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:16,335
You lost your mother.

390
00:21:17,341 --> 00:21:19,832
It's only natural you'd be so elmo.

391
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:23,245
- Emo.
- That's not a word, sweetie.

392
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:25,777
God, you sound just like her.

393
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:30,045
She didn't even know me.

394
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,953
She didn't know me any more than you do.

395
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:34,217
She didn't want to.

396
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,282
I'm sure that's not true.

397
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,527
I take pictures. I'm good.

398
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:42,857
She never came to a single one
of my exhibitions.

399
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:45,060
You were serious about that ?

400
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:49,428
I mean, obviously you
were serious about that.

401
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,742
You're right.

402
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:57,570
That was very bad of her.

403
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:59,207
I don't know what to say.

404
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:01,682
All of her lectures about being practical,

405
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:04,152
and then she throws herself
at some little tropical cookie

406
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:05,449
she picked up in Manila.

407
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:06,989
He is my age !

408
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:08,848
Some tropical... Jocelyn !

409
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,756
He played her like a fool.

410
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:12,795
He spent her money,
and he probably slept with every woman

411
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,956
who set foot in this place.

412
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:16,560
Did he...

413
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:20,497
- Tell me, did he ever try...
- With me ?

414
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:22,165
God, no.

415
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:23,937
Although I wouldn't put it past him.

416
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:25,702
If you don't believe me, go talk to him.

417
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:28,609
When your ass hits the sheets,
you'll know.

418
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,404
I spent my whole life

419
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,576
watching her being, you know, tough,

420
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:41,349
and it was okay that she didn't let me in
because she didn't let anyone in.

421
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:43,553
Right ?

422
00:22:43,827 --> 00:22:46,819
And then two years ago, she meets Jack,

423
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:50,162
and she's all fluttering

424
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:53,862
and whispering secrets, and then...

425
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:57,464
Now there's you.

426
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:06,980
Whatever.

427
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,882
Holy...

428
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:16,218
Sorry.

429
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:17,954
You can't be here.

430
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:21,259
I need you to run some prints.

431
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:24,230
They're entered, all keyed up.

432
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:28,531
Just need authorization.

433
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,740
Comfy ?

434
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,574
I shouldn't do this.

435
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:45,051
I got prints on someone
who might be a missing person.

436
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:47,556
You got prints on someone
who might be a doll, you mean.

437
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:51,492
They are missing people, you know.
They just don't know it.

438
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:58,300
My God, it's her.
How do we access the file ?

439
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:00,233
Polly Keller ?

440
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:03,735
Oh, my God.
What...

441
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:05,502
They're gone.

442
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:07,099
What just happened ?

443
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,445
I just started to believe you.

444
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,519
Earth-identical gravity
and atmosphere on other planets.

445
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:25,862
- Is that two ?
- I'll give you one.

446
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:28,727
That's fair.
One ecosystem for a whole planet.

447
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,891
Good.

448
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:33,998
Human-alien cross-breeding
without scientific intervention.

449
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,196
Nice.

450
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:38,435
Flamey explosions and sound in a vacuum.

451
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:39,566
Yes !

452
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,135
Good job.

453
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,236
Oh, but there's so much more.

454
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:46,874
Light speed travel,
space storms and sexy, sexy aliens.

455
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,550
I said classic sci-fi errors.

456
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,520
Now you're just attacking
good storytelling.

457
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:56,390
Speaking of sci-fi,
can we play with the sleepies ?

458
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,256
- No.
- Come on, Topher.

459
00:24:58,328 --> 00:25:02,628
We could have them battle one another
and bet on them like gladiators.

460
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:06,466
We can't play with the sleepies.

461
00:25:06,536 --> 00:25:09,061
Or we could have them
act out skits we write,

462
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:11,733
film it and see who gets
more hits on YouTube.

463
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:15,107
That's not a bad idea, but no.

464
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:16,475
You want to play chess ?

465
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:19,413
A variant ? Flying chess.

466
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:22,417
Excellent. But how about every time
you lose a piece, you drink ?

467
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,180
Sounds good.

468
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:26,379
Advantage, me.

469
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:37,563
Hey. I couldn't help but...

470
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:42,500
- Are you going somewhere ?
- Yep.

471
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:45,040
I got the first ticket to Not Here.

472
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:47,576
Margaret belonged here. I didn't.

473
00:25:47,844 --> 00:25:49,744
I just belonged to her.

474
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:57,147
- She seemed very devoted to you.
- Hmm.

475
00:25:58,555 --> 00:25:59,647
Yeah.

476
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:08,763
- Was it hard ?
- Was what, what ?

477
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,135
Being married to someone older ?

478
00:26:15,505 --> 00:26:18,030
A man like you would have options.

479
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:22,938
Hand me that tie ?

480
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:28,311
Maybe you didn't exercise those options.

481
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:30,281
Maybe...

482
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:33,987
Maybe you waited very patiently
until you were free.

483
00:26:42,432 --> 00:26:44,161
I know who you are.

484
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:48,400
And I don't know which of them hired you,

485
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:51,707
but I know a spy when I see one.

486
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:53,766
What are you trying to find out ?

487
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:57,074
If I killed her,
or if I'm on to the person who did ?

488
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:59,980
Either way, what you're doing is sick.

489
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,747
Wearing her perfume,
trying this summer stock seduction.

490
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:09,617
You working for Nicolas ? Jocelyn ?

491
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:12,288
Tell them they're looking
in the wrong place.

492
00:27:12,362 --> 00:27:13,522
Tell them I'm selling the horses

493
00:27:13,596 --> 00:27:17,589
because I can't stand the constant
reminder of the woman I loved.

494
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:19,227
Oh.

495
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,673
They want a real bad guy,
tell them to look at dear old Uncle Bill.

496
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:31,147
He just came for the funeral.

497
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:33,648
Oh, no. Didn't he mention that ?

498
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:36,151
He came the day before she died.

499
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:38,481
He did ?

500
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:41,514
That was after the last...

501
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,917
The last time I spoke to Margaret.

502
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:45,427
He showed up out of nowhere.

503
00:27:45,495 --> 00:27:47,463
Needed to talk to her.

504
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,895
About what ?

505
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,196
She said she'd tell me later.

506
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:57,473
If I had to guess,
I'd say he wanted to borrow money.

507
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,667
And I guess she said no.

508
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,614
William ?

509
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:13,351
Hey, hey. Hey.

510
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,555
Okay, okay.

511
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,723
Not short on spirit.

512
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:20,696
Oh, gorgeous.

513
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:25,366
I worked with his sire a few years back.
This one's got better hooves.

514
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:26,993
What about EIPH ?

515
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,163
No history of hemorrhaging.

516
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:34,042
His lungs are fine.

517
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,839
Who the hell are you ?

518
00:28:35,912 --> 00:28:38,972
I'm gonna buy this here horse,
if everything works out.

519
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,244
He barely waited for her body
to be in the ground.

520
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:42,909
What was that ?

521
00:28:42,986 --> 00:28:44,715
This was my mother's horse.

522
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:46,983
It was her favorite thing.

523
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:49,458
I can't believe the bastard's selling it.

524
00:28:49,526 --> 00:28:50,959
He should.

525
00:28:51,027 --> 00:28:52,756
This horse has got another
year of racing in him.

526
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:54,956
- You think so ?
- At least.

527
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:58,533
Won't fetch this price forever, though.

528
00:28:58,601 --> 00:28:59,829
You know what,
I don't want to hear about it.

529
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:01,564
Whatever you're doing, stop.

530
00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:03,765
Stop thinking, stop testing.

531
00:29:04,974 --> 00:29:06,635
He's not for sale.

532
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,512
Do you believe in ghosts ?

533
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,187
Uh, sort of.

534
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:26,251
Just recently.

535
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:30,924
Margaret and I moved into
this house when we were kids.

536
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,025
We were convinced it was haunted.

537
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:35,731
Slept in the same bed the first night.

538
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:38,469
Anyway...

539
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:42,169
I'm getting the same
creepy feeling again, now.

540
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:45,278
Like Margaret is lingering here.

541
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:48,343
And she's angry.

542
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:50,509
Why would she be angry ?

543
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:52,817
Because she wanted more time.

544
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:56,956
You know, we hadn't said
one word to each other in 13 years.

545
00:29:57,961 --> 00:30:00,521
She wouldn't pick up the phone

546
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:03,031
because she was too damn stubborn.

547
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:05,431
And you ? Why wouldn't you call ?

548
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:07,936
Because I was too damn stubborn.

549
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,837
But fate grabbed an old fool

550
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:14,001
by the scruff of his neck
and brought me here.

551
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:16,378
Just in time.

552
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:18,714
The day before she died.

553
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:20,910
I just knocked on the door.

554
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,721
Can't say she was thrilled
to see me at first,

555
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:28,689
but I expected as much.

556
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:31,817
The important thing, we reconciled.

557
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:34,727
Can you...

558
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:38,529
Can you tell me what she said ?

559
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:43,097
"Hey, remember the time..." "Yeah, yeah."

560
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:46,301
No, it wasn't the words that mattered.

561
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:48,839
It was...

562
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:53,941
She just looked in my face
and I looked in hers,

563
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:58,812
and we just both knew there
was no reason to stay mad.

564
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,926
Here's to you, Margaret.

565
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:10,864
Mmm.

566
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,434
Well, I guess I was the lucky one.

567
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,865
Nicolas would be coping with this better

568
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:19,136
if he'd talk to her about
his debts and all that.

569
00:31:19,242 --> 00:31:21,938
Addiction, not for the faint of heart.

570
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:34,045
In a world where
all men are guilty until proven dead,

571
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:38,755
one man stands as our only hope
in the fight against...

572
00:32:23,606 --> 00:32:25,836
I told you I've got your back.

573
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:27,770
Nice.

574
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:30,738
Or, "I told you you'd get it in the end."

575
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:33,304
"The quickest way to a man's
heart is through his back."

576
00:32:33,383 --> 00:32:37,285
"I'm sending you back
to the future of being dead."

577
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:39,954
This one's going nowhere.

578
00:32:40,023 --> 00:32:43,083
- What are we at ?
- Tied up. Best of 7 ?

579
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:44,524
Eleven.

580
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:48,596
Hey, you.

581
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:54,696
How was your day ?

582
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:56,935
You know, fine, I guess.

583
00:32:57,006 --> 00:33:00,169
I let myself in a little while ago.
Hope you don't mind.

584
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:03,610
- You have a key.
- I know, but it's just your apartment

585
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,204
and with everything lately...

586
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:06,475
I don't know, I don't want you thinking

587
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,540
I'm in here nuzzling your shirts
while you're gone,

588
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:10,586
anything weird like that.

589
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:12,678
- Good to know.
- I mean, they smell really good.

590
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:16,885
Some of them not so much,
but overall your shirts are nuzzle-worthy.

591
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:19,720
Joke.

592
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:23,059
Geez, so grumpy.

593
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:31,130
That looks nice.

594
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:33,505
Cabernet. I bought it.

595
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:36,373
I should have gotten white, though.
Red wine makes my teeth purple.

596
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:39,472
- Paul, we have to talk.
- Okay.

597
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:43,178
Well, you don't have to talk,
but you have to let me talk at you.

598
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:45,914
Because I've been thinking a lot, and...

599
00:33:45,988 --> 00:33:48,013
Just let me do this, okay ?

600
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:50,384
Good.

601
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:54,223
Paul...

602
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:56,292
Mellie.

603
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:58,898
I like being with you.

604
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:02,099
I love it, actually.

605
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:07,068
And you say everything's fine,
so I'm going to stop asking if it is.

606
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:08,573
If that means lying next to you
while everything's not fine,

607
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:10,004
If that means lying next to you
while everything's not fine,

608
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:12,067
then that's what I'll do.

609
00:34:12,812 --> 00:34:16,578
I will give you what you need
and let you take it from me.

610
00:34:17,517 --> 00:34:20,281
And if you want to give back, give back.

611
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,047
But it doesn't have to mean anything.

612
00:34:23,123 --> 00:34:25,751
It doesn't have to mean anything.

613
00:35:27,954 --> 00:35:30,582
I've still got it, don't I, handsome ?

614
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:39,290
I know. I miss you more.

615
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:54,509
Strange,
he doesn't like most people.

616
00:35:54,581 --> 00:35:55,980
Who's there ?

617
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:01,449
I have a better question.

618
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:05,289
Did you think I wouldn't
recognize my own mother,

619
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:07,520
Mother ?

620
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:15,896
Honestly, it's a relief.

621
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:20,662
I couldn't tell a soul what was going on
and it was proving difficult.

622
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:22,332
How did you know ?

623
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:26,003
Well, little things, you know,
like the way you moved.

624
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,513
And I watched you through
your window the other night

625
00:36:28,581 --> 00:36:30,776
when you were trying to go
to bed in your old room.

626
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,976
Same routine as always.

627
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:34,383
You checked the shutters,
flipped the light switch down the hall

628
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:36,012
that's impossible to find.

629
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,489
Nobody knows where it is but you.

630
00:36:39,192 --> 00:36:41,888
But I didn't really know
until I saw you with King's Ransom.

631
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:43,121
Oh.

632
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:45,988
It was definitely after I tried to kiss you.

633
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:47,862
Oh.

634
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:49,834
Well, I should hope so.

635
00:36:50,336 --> 00:36:54,033
But, I mean, how would you
ever even think it was possible ?

636
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:56,531
The Dollhouse.

637
00:36:57,277 --> 00:37:00,644
In Manhattan, right ? I am a customer.

638
00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:02,578
- Nicolas.
- What ? So are you.

639
00:37:02,649 --> 00:37:05,015
We're all adults here, sort of.

640
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:07,753
I didn't use it for anything like this.

641
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,756
I mean, life after death ?
I never even considered that.

642
00:37:11,824 --> 00:37:13,815
I don't get to keep it.

643
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:15,554
I didn't think so.

644
00:37:16,296 --> 00:37:18,526
Although, the possibilities...

645
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:21,929
Living forever, moving from body to body.

646
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:24,000
Brilliant.

647
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:26,864
People should know that
you are to be feared, Mother.

648
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,601
Even after death.

649
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:31,370
Feared ?

650
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:36,215
Nicky, I only ever wanted you to be happy.

651
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,449
I'm your mother.
I'm supposed to bear your burdens,

652
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,852
even if you lost everything.

653
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,455
I couldn't stop.

654
00:37:50,997 --> 00:37:52,828
Gambling is all about ups and downs,

655
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:55,800
and when it seems like
you have all these...

656
00:37:56,903 --> 00:37:58,598
All these resources,

657
00:37:58,671 --> 00:38:00,536
you can just wait around
for another upswing,

658
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:02,801
so I kept chasing losses...

659
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,634
And then you hit bottom.

660
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:08,044
And I went below it.

661
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:10,109
Nicolas.

662
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,242
That's millions.

663
00:38:14,487 --> 00:38:19,117
I knew that you would be ashamed of me
and that you wouldn't let it lie,

664
00:38:19,192 --> 00:38:21,820
so I couldn't tell you.

665
00:38:23,162 --> 00:38:24,459
I couldn't tell you.

666
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,397
Okay, okay. We'll...

667
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:30,792
It'll be all right.

668
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,497
After you died,

669
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:35,006
part of me was relieved
because you never knew.

670
00:38:35,074 --> 00:38:38,339
But now, I just want you back.

671
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:42,579
You were taken from me too soon.

672
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:45,147
Smart boy.

673
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:47,919
You suspect that, too.

674
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:50,182
Look, he's supposed to
be worth over $4 million.

675
00:38:50,256 --> 00:38:51,621
Go, go !

676
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:54,653
You think you can hustle me ?

677
00:38:54,727 --> 00:38:56,524
Oh, what the hell do you mean ?

678
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:58,928
King's Ransom has been juiced.

679
00:38:58,998 --> 00:39:01,125
Anabolic steroids, stimulants.

680
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,327
Enough to make his heart pop.

681
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:06,201
You really think you could hide
this with a little clomiphene citrate ?

682
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:08,297
I mean, masking agents
can't hide themselves, you know.

683
00:39:08,374 --> 00:39:10,035
If I wasn't looking for it,
I might have been fooled,

684
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:13,044
but I ain't a baby in this freaking business.

685
00:39:13,713 --> 00:39:14,975
You were going for a money grab.

686
00:39:15,048 --> 00:39:18,313
Trying to pass that horse off
as race ready, raise his value.

687
00:39:18,384 --> 00:39:19,783
He looks that way now,

688
00:39:19,852 --> 00:39:23,811
but a couple weeks without that stuff,
he'll be put to pasture.

689
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,519
I know you're new to this,
but in layman's terms,

690
00:39:27,593 --> 00:39:30,289
you just made yourself a $4 million pet.

691
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:12,460
He killed me. Oh, God.

692
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:15,336
Whatever he gave to King's Ransom,
that's what he used on me.

693
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:17,706
Okay, okay. Calm down.
We just have to think.

694
00:40:17,777 --> 00:40:19,802
Why ? Why don't I just walk out there
and let him kill me twice ?

695
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:22,279
- I'm dead anyway.
- Because you can prove that he did it.

696
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:24,339
You can give him
the punishment that he deserves.

697
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,248
Run !

698
00:40:44,604 --> 00:40:46,731
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

699
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:48,171
Not at all.

700
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:51,800
Victor tested the horse
and I just got the results.

701
00:40:51,878 --> 00:40:54,574
My hunch was correct.
They were tied together.

702
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:57,878
Your friend was killed with a drug
that was being given to the horse.

703
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:01,249
The killer masked it,
so the coroner didn't find it.

704
00:41:02,688 --> 00:41:04,986
- Any idea who ?
- No.

705
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:09,227
- Lf I went in...
- She has a new Handler.

706
00:41:10,129 --> 00:41:12,723
You're going to have to get used to it.

707
00:41:12,798 --> 00:41:14,459
Yes, I guess I am.

708
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:18,266
One other thing, Miss DeWitt.

709
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:21,500
Are you aware of this Topher situation ?

710
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:24,200
Yes.

711
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:28,436
There's no need to address
the issue with him.

712
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:33,074
I allow him one of these
diagnostic tests every now and again.

713
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:39,285
So, I guess Topher can make friends.

714
00:41:40,293 --> 00:41:42,818
Loneliness leads to nothing good,

715
00:41:43,996 --> 00:41:45,691
only detachment.

716
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:48,731
And sometimes the people
who most need to reach out

717
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:51,565
are the people least capable of it.

718
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:53,264
In any case,

719
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:58,109
it only happens once a year.

720
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,553
Come on, come on, come on.

721
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:14,456
He's coming. What's your plan ?

722
00:42:14,527 --> 00:42:15,551
You got a gun stashed somewhere ?

723
00:42:15,628 --> 00:42:17,892
No. You know how I feel about guns.

724
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:19,363
Though I'm warming up
to them right now.

725
00:42:19,432 --> 00:42:20,592
Evidence.

726
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,190
There is evidence that he killed you.

727
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:23,633
Just the drug, but we can't prove...

728
00:42:23,703 --> 00:42:25,170
No, not that.

729
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,230
A letter from Margaret Bashford

730
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:29,797
in her own handwriting,
written a week ago

731
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:31,240
and hidden somewhere in this room.

732
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,868
Nicky, that's brilliant.

733
00:42:32,945 --> 00:42:35,379
Great letter. Says that he'd do it,
when he'd do it and how he'd do it.

734
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:36,608
Okay.

735
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:40,214
The jury's gonna eat this up.

736
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,155
What was the date, the day I died ?

737
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:50,490
The 19th.

738
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:55,325
It's all here.

739
00:42:55,401 --> 00:43:00,100
How he'll use the same masking agent
he's been doping the horses with to...

740
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:02,072
Jack didn't know much about them.

741
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:05,440
We have to hurry.
Let's find a place to hide it.

742
00:43:06,145 --> 00:43:08,705
How would he learn
how to drug a racehorse ?

743
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:10,112
Well, he must have had help.

744
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:12,650
It's not that hard to find someone
with that type of knowledge, you know ?

745
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,447
He must have...

746
00:43:22,194 --> 00:43:23,388
Oh, mother.

747
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,632
You could never let things lie.

748
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:39,142
Nicolas. What are you doing ?

749
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:42,578
What in the hell do I have to do
to get you off my damn back, Mother ?

750
00:43:42,648 --> 00:43:43,706
This was difficult the first time.

751
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:45,307
But being around you more,
it's getting easier.

752
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:46,908
Nicky, I love you.

753
00:43:46,986 --> 00:43:49,477
I can even see why
you drugged King's Ransom.

754
00:43:49,555 --> 00:43:51,022
You thought you could sell him,
get out of a hole.

755
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,421
I had to make him worth something.

756
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:54,550
In case all you left me
was the damn horses.

757
00:43:54,627 --> 00:43:56,151
But Jack got stuck with them.

758
00:43:56,228 --> 00:43:57,490
Even better.

759
00:43:57,563 --> 00:43:58,996
So, you were going to kill me
no matter what.

760
00:43:59,065 --> 00:44:00,362
It was the only way to
get out of the hole, Mom.

761
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:01,593
I didn't expect you to come back.

762
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,032
Or Jack to figure out you did it.

763
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:05,229
Jack gets into everything, doesn't he ?

764
00:44:05,304 --> 00:44:06,703
My business.

765
00:44:07,006 --> 00:44:08,769
My mother's bed.

766
00:44:12,211 --> 00:44:14,509
- I really am sorry, Mom.
- No !

767
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,946
This is going to sting a little.

768
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:21,680
I knew it was you.

769
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:31,621
Come here.

770
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:50,978
Darling ! Are you all right ?

771
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,278
He killed my wife.

772
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,342
Jack, are you all right ?

773
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,812
He murdered Margaret. He killed my wife.

774
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:01,052
What the hell is going on ?

775
00:45:01,127 --> 00:45:03,561
Call an ambulance. And the police.

776
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,524
Okay.

777
00:45:13,105 --> 00:45:14,367
Margaret...

778
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:16,000
Yes ?

779
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:19,977
I hope she didn't know...
Didn't know the truth about her son.

780
00:45:20,946 --> 00:45:22,937
It would have killed her.

781
00:45:23,382 --> 00:45:24,781
It did.

782
00:45:31,924 --> 00:45:33,949
"...most likely with clomiphene citrate,

783
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:36,995
"or any other drug used
to mask the doping of horses..."

784
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:38,689
My God. She knew ?

785
00:45:39,265 --> 00:45:41,290
"On or around the 19th.

786
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:45,496
"You will also find
enclosed a last will and testament,

787
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:48,131

788

"but he will be spending
his life behind bars no doubt,

791
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,411
"so what use would it be to him ?

792
00:45:56,482 --> 00:46:03,081
"In any case, that means
more for everybody else. Yay."

793
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:06,919
Mother wrote this ?

794
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,362
"Jocelyn,

795
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,160

800
00:46:28,013 --> 00:46:30,413
That was pretty crazy last night.

801
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:34,452
I don't know if I can handle
that all the time, but...

802
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,549
I kind of liked it.

803
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:39,013
Not all the time, though.

804
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:41,783
So, you going to do more hunting today ?

805
00:46:41,861 --> 00:46:43,886
For Dollhouse clients ?

806
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:46,021
I found one.

807
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,500
I don't know when I'll have the chance
to see something like this again.

808
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:03,705
I wish Margaret was here.

809
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,812
You could

810
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,185
pretend she could hear you.

811
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,327
No, I don't believe in that stuff.

812
00:47:20,132 --> 00:47:23,966
I just hope I did what I could
when she was here, you know ?

813
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:28,936
I tried to show her as best
I could that she was...

814
00:47:31,644 --> 00:47:33,771
She was my favorite person.

815
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:36,644
Plain and simple.

816
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:41,013
But I'll never know if she believed me.

817
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:44,848
I have a feeling she did.

818
00:48:07,212 --> 00:48:11,239
Tell me you weren't tempted,
even a little, not to come back here today,

819
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:14,115
just to disappear in this body.

820
00:48:16,155 --> 00:48:17,679
Maybe a little.

821
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:20,817
But I've had my turn,

822
00:48:20,893 --> 00:48:23,418
and the people I love are moving on.

823
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:26,754
Besides...

824
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:28,365
Besides ?

825
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,567
I know you, Adelle.

826
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:33,163
You're too much like me.

827
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:37,170
I wouldn't have gotten
as far as the airport.

828
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,352
- Addy ?
- Yes ?

829
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:52,486
Will I see my whole life
flash before my eyes ?

830
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,522
Every single moment.
