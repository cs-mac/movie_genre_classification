00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:08,274
Why aren't we getting it?

4
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:11,794
They're not doing a live broadcast.

5
00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:13,354
Why not?

6
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:15,749
The opposition party protested.

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:19,314
They said it was unfair.

8
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:22,994
They must be nervous.

9
00:00:23,114 --> 00:00:25,634
Call and find out.
The results must be in.

10
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:27,996
<i>- This is a news flash
- There it is.</i>

11
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:32,754
<i>The results for the Chungbuk
party election are in.</i>

12
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:35,005
<i>Kim Gyeongmo...</i>

13
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,954
Why aren't they showing the total
number of voters?

14
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:38,244
Be quiet.

15
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:41,514
- Shin Huiju, 421 votes.
- Please.

16
00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:46,394
Jang Iljun, 803 votes.

17
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:50,074
- 803 votes? What does that come to?
- Jang Iljun is in 1st place.

18
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:51,794
<i>Shin Huiju is in 2nd place.</i>

19
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:53,594
- Kim Gyeongmo is in 3rd place.
- We won.

20
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:59,674
Are you sure?
We were 376 votes behind last time.

21
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,234
<i>Shin Huiju is in 2nd place.</i>

22
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:16,314
Jang Iljun! Jang Iljun!

23
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:19,314
Congratulations, honey.

24
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:20,674
Congratulations.

25
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:24,114
Congratulations,
it was a touching victory.

26
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:24,994
Thanks.

27
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:28,594
You made it through the tough part.
I'm proud of you.

28
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,074
This is just the beginning.

29
00:01:31,714 --> 00:01:36,954
We have to figure out how to
beat Kim Gyeongmo now.

30
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:40,514
He's probably exhausted by now.
You can beat him.

31
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,194
I should.

32
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:45,194
Shouldn't you call Shin Huiju?

33
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:47,914
You saw her.

34
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:52,114
I think she's shocked.
Let's give her some time.

35
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:13,874
Ms. Shin.

36
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:34,714
I'm alright.
Go ahead.

37
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:13,354
How can this be?

38
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:17,914
Were the ballots rigged?
It's a difference of 6 votes.

39
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:25,594
I lost.
They rechecked.

40
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:35,794
You were so confident.

41
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:41,554
I was a fool to trust you.

42
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:44,674
I shouldn't have held hands with you.

43
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:48,114
That's upsetting to hear.

44
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:52,434
You were 1st place in Daejeon
and Chungnam.

45
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:56,114
Who knew Cheongam would go crazy?

46
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:03,154
Ms. Shin.

47
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:10,794
How about abandoning Jang Iljun
and going with Kim Gyeongmo?

48
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:13,554
What are you talking about?

49
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:15,394
You want me to break my promise?

50
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:19,394
Promises are made to be broken
once in a while.

51
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:21,714
Do you think I'm like you?

52
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:25,634
Stop yelling at me?

53
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:33,354
I know I play dirty, but doesn't
Jang Iljun also?

54
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:38,554
If I'm a blowfly, he's a gadfly.

55
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:43,234
Compared to that,
Kim Gyeongmo is a saint.

56
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:47,474
I'm saying this for your sake.

57
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:56,114
Why would a saint accept a fly?

58
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:01,914
That's my problem, so don't worry.

59
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:06,874
Baek Changi owes me.

60
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:10,914
Shin Huiju?

61
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:14,674
Yes. Get Shin Huiju.

62
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:17,674
No.

63
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:19,714
You know what she's like.

64
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:21,554
You have to get her.

65
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:27,274
If she merges with Jang Iljun,
it could be a tough race.

66
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:31,690
I asked her about it before.
She refused.

67
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,055
That's because she had
a possibility of winning then.

68
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:43,795
If they made a secret promise, as
we suspect, she can't win now.

69
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:47,514
She wouldn't break her promise.

70
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:53,074
People change, especially when
it comes to politics.

71
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:56,314
She held hands with Park Eulseop.

72
00:05:56,434 --> 00:06:02,154
We have to do whatever we can.

73
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:12,674
<i>You will be connected to the
voice message system.</i>

74
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:14,754
She's not answering?

75
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:16,714
No.

76
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,994
Was the shock too great?

77
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,714
We have to accomplish the merge today.

78
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:27,714
Isn't it a bit strange?

79
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:34,794
Would she...

80
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:50,034
I only came because you were so insistent,
but I'm not feeling very well right now.

81
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:54,074
Let me get right to the point.

82
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:58,914
Did you promise to merge with
Jang Iljun after this party election?

83
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,114
Yes.

84
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,913
Did Mr. Park tell you?

85
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:07,634
Please reconsider.

86
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:17,474
I know you're desperate,
but don't make me pathetic.

87
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:19,874
I'm not a lying politician.

88
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:26,594
I know, but think about it.

89
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:32,474
Who is more honest?
Jang Iljun or me?

90
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:39,954
If you want a world based on
laws, principle and justice,

91
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:43,874
who should become president,
Jang Iljun or me?

92
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:46,514
Justice begins with keeping promises.

93
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,594
Think of the greater cause.

94
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:56,234
Didn't you hold hands with Park Eulseop
for that greater cause?

95
00:07:57,474 --> 00:08:02,634
My offer is still valid.

96
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:07,194
I will make you
practical prime minister.

97
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:16,474
Don't be tied down by the little things.
Make a greater choice for the country.

98
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:33,754
Mr. Jang.

99
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:36,794
Ms. Shin, where are you going?

100
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:40,234
- Well...
- Let's go inside.

101
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,994
Isn't that a bit rude?

102
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:57,954
Let's talk inside.

103
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:03,874
Where were you going?

104
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:09,234
I was going to hear him out.

105
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:11,074
About what?

106
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:19,234
Fine, I'll be honest.

107
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,674
I don't like you.

108
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:28,994
You're good at lying and you're
crafty.

109
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:32,551
I'm not sure how much I can trust you.

110
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:37,874
I'm not sure if I should do my best
to campaign for you.

111
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,754
So, you want to break your promise?

112
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:49,674
Fine, I'll admit it.

113
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:57,514
I used tactics you don't like to
win this fight.

114
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:03,874
I started with nothing just like you.

115
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:09,434
We didn't have any assemblymen
or factions to support us.

116
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:18,194
I wouldn't have tried this hard if
I'd had everything like Kim Gyeongmo.

117
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:25,194
I could have been leisurely,
but I couldn't win like that.

118
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:31,034
You can't beat the opposition party
if you're like Kim Gyeongmo.

119
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:33,954
How can you be so sure?

120
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:38,354
A full tiger can't hunt.

121
00:10:38,474 --> 00:10:43,034
Kim Gyeongmo lived in high society.

122
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:52,754
He was never hungry and even if he is,
he refuses to hunt.

123
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:58,594
He can be a good administrator,
but he won't win the election.

124
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:04,234
Are you saying it's alright to
do anything to win?

125
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:08,954
What you do after you win is important.

126
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:14,234
I understand you don't like me.

127
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:19,994
You were in mainstream society
from a young age, too.

128
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,074
However, we have commonalities, too.

129
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:27,154
We both grew up knowing what it's
like to be hungry.

130
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:33,674
If you don't like me, look
at my policies.

131
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:41,714
Are my policies closer to the country
you want or are Kim Gyeongmo's?

132
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,714
Now what?

133
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:54,434
I said I'd take care of that after
the party election.

134
00:11:56,074 --> 00:12:00,234
We get our trust money back.

135
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,954
Let's talk about this later.

136
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:05,354
I can't worry about that right now.

137
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:10,194
What was that about?

138
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,034
It's nothing.

139
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:15,514
It didn't sound like nothing.

140
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:18,834
Do we have funding problems?

141
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:30,074
There seem to be some problems.

142
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:37,954
Kim Gyeongmo has plenty of funds,
but we never have enough.

143
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:45,674
I'm telling everyone I'll pay them
back after the party election,

144
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:47,834
but the trust money won't be enough.

145
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:49,434
Why didn't you say something?

146
00:12:49,554 --> 00:12:54,074
Jang is allergic to money.
I couldn't tell him.

147
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:56,634
Don't worry.

148
00:12:56,754 --> 00:13:00,354
Everything will be solved if he becomes
the presidential candidate.

149
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:02,394
What will you do before then?

150
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:06,794
Half the voters are in Seoul and
the metropolitan area.

151
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:15,874
- Discuss funds with me.
- Professor Jo.

152
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:19,954
Discuss it with me.
Keep it a secret from him.

153
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:27,234
Fine.

154
00:13:29,114 --> 00:13:31,754
I understand.

155
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:36,994
I have three demands.

156
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:39,274
Go ahead.

157
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:46,234
Have your wife stay away from
the campaign office.

158
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,234
Why?

159
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:56,834
It doesn't look too good for her
to act like your advisor.

160
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:59,354
It doesn't fit Korean sentiments.

161
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:06,474
I explained that publicly several times.
She's my political companion.

162
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,874
What's wrong with her being
at the campaign office?

163
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:15,234
You're a woman and you're
running for president.

164
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:18,354
Why is my wife a problem?

165
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:23,674
It's because of past experience.

166
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:29,394
The current first lady abuses power.

167
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:33,794
My wife would never do that.

168
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:37,474
I can't accept that demand.

169
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,394
Is that so?

170
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:48,794
Second, make all decisions after
discussing them with me from now on.

171
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:52,714
No tricks or conspiracies
without my approval.

172
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:56,474
I have the right to ask as your partner.

173
00:14:56,954 --> 00:15:05,594
I agree, but there will be unavoidable
situations where I have to decide.

174
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:13,034
If we were equal, there would be
no reason for a merge.

175
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,394
So, you can't accept that either?

176
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,554
What's the third?

177
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:28,074
Kim Gyeongmo offered me the
practical prime minister position.

178
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:34,954
What can you do for me?

179
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:38,834
That's not like you.

180
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:44,874
I didn't think you'd make deals
with positions.

181
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:50,194
Aren't you good at negotiating?

182
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:54,754
You can't accept any of my demands.

183
00:15:54,874 --> 00:16:00,594
I could lie and agree to everything.

184
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:05,434
But I don't want to deceive you
right now.

185
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:12,914
It might work, but I could lose you
forever.

186
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:19,434
I really need you.

187
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:31,314
The negotiations are lasting long.

188
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,074
I'm getting nervous.

189
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,434
What if Shin Huiju doesn't keep
her promise to merge?

190
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:40,274
Stop saying things like that.

191
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:43,034
That must be him.

192
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:47,994
Mr. Jang, how did it go?

193
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,834
What?

194
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:55,114
Did she break it off?

195
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:56,980
I see.

196
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:00,314
Okay.

197
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,794
Ms. Oh...

198
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:12,034
He wants us to call a press
conference for a merge.

199
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:14,474
You...

200
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:15,874
I gotcha.

201
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,554
Right?

202
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:19,034
That was mean.

203
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:24,394
Oh, boy.
Is your sense of humor that low?

204
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:25,994
What?

205
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:32,634
He always makes everything sound
so unpleasant.

206
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,594
I gotcha.
Right?

207
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:37,634
I gotcha.

208
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:42,034
I ought to...

209
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:44,354
Hey!
Come here!

210
00:17:48,474 --> 00:18:01,114
We are announcing a merge to
make our country a prosperous one.

211
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:08,554
I resign from my candidacy.
I will support Jang Iljun.

212
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:15,314
Two young and energetic people
have joined forces.

213
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:20,034
We will supplement our weaknesses
and share our strengths.

214
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:24,834
We will win this party election.

215
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:33,754
Then, we will win the presidential
election and meet your expectations.

216
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:39,994
Vote for Jang Iljun as our
party candidate.

217
00:18:40,514 --> 00:18:47,514
We will change your lives.

218
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:09,994
Jang Iljun and Shin Huiju announce a merge
Things have changed for the New Wave Party

219
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:15,394
I shouldn't have given
Jang Iljun any room.

220
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:19,354
He keeps shoving his way in
and changing things.

221
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:23,434
It's no use talking about the past.
The future is important.

222
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:25,354
How is this going to affect us?

223
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:29,274
It could have a large effect on
the Incheon party election.

224
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:32,634
You might not be first place.

225
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:38,514
But you have a lot of votes,
so you'll probably maintain the lead.

226
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:44,594
It was a mistake to give our votes
to Shin Huiju.

227
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:49,874
We have to deal with this merge
from now on.

228
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:59,274
Thank you very much.
You won't regret this.

229
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:04,794
Regrets aren't good.
We should all be careful.

230
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:09,754
Forgive me if I was rude to you before.

231
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:12,314
We're on the same side now.
We should get along.

232
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:15,114
That would be nice.

233
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:21,274
Hello, I'm the campaign director,
Lee Chisu.

234
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:27,274
Mr. Lee, I've heard a lot about you.
It's nice to meet you.

235
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:33,448
You're the top candidate for
executive secretary of the Blue House.

236
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,114
Oh, no.

237
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,314
I just do all the menial work
at the bottom.

238
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:44,114
We need people like you
for Mr. Jang to stand out.

239
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:48,074
Let's work together and do
a good job.

240
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:50,074
Thank you.

241
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:00,074
- Hello, I'm Jang Iljun.
- Vote for Jang Iljun.

242
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:01,874
We'll work hard.

243
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,354
Vote for Jang Iljun.

244
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:08,874
Take care of this first.

245
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:27,034
The world is running a green race
for green growth.

246
00:21:28,034 --> 00:21:32,794
I will create 600,00 jobs with
my green new deal policy.

247
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:38,754
It's time for change.
Give a chance to the young people.

248
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:43,874
I will create a dynamic Korea!

249
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:52,034
I will take power with Shin Huiju!

250
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:58,114
Yeah!

251
00:21:59,994 --> 00:22:05,794
<i>Jang Iljun beat Kim Gyeongmo in the
Incheon party election after the merge.</i>

252
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:10,474
<i>However, Kim Gyeongmo took
the lead in Gyeonggi.</i>

253
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:15,674
<i>The voting rate is over 80%.</i>

254
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:20,754
Both sides are criticizing each other.

255
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:23,434
With the final Seoul party
election remaining,

256
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:28,394
Kim Gyeongmo is in the lead by
2,300 votes.

257
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:33,594
The outcome still can't be predicted.

258
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:36,474
Congratulations on returning to Seoul.

259
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:37,954
Thanks.

260
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:42,994
Welcome.

261
00:22:43,114 --> 00:22:44,954
For me?

262
00:22:45,074 --> 00:22:46,714
You're so beautiful.

263
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:50,114
Will you go on a date with me
some time?

264
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:55,874
Any time.
I like younger men who are tall.

265
00:22:56,754 --> 00:23:00,994
Be careful, he's a playboy.

266
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:06,914
Don't I get a bouquet?

267
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,154
Congratulations.

268
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:12,514
Thank you.

269
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,234
What about me?
I worked hard, too.

270
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:21,329
I'll give you a kiss.

271
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:25,234
Never mind.
Let's start the meeting.

272
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:29,794
Kim Gyeongmo has 22,969 votes.

273
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:36,394
You have 20,649 votes.
It's a difference of 2,300 votes.

274
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:44,434
It's a big difference in a regional
election, but not in Seoul.

275
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:47,274
How many voters are there in Seoul?

276
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:49,714
There are 16,000.

277
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:55,194
The voting rate is going up.
Up to 14,000 people could vote.

278
00:23:55,314 --> 00:24:01,394
It means more younger people are
voting. That's good for us.

279
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:03,674
The merger of two young people
had a good effect.

280
00:24:03,794 --> 00:24:08,274
The voting rate was 80
percent in Gyeonggi, but we lost.

281
00:24:08,394 --> 00:24:11,754
It's because the party members unify.

282
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:17,714
It's about 8 to 2 for Kim Gyeongmo.

283
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:23,514
They even have buses to transport
the voters.

284
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:26,714
There are reports that
they're even buying tickets.

285
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:30,794
Have more people watch and
report to the election committee.

286
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:35,274
It will be forgotten after the election.

287
00:24:35,394 --> 00:24:38,554
We need more people, too.

288
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:41,994
What are you talking about?

289
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:46,794
Do we have the funds to do that?

290
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:50,794
No.

291
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:53,674
We have to rely on volunteers.

292
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:56,794
Then we'll have to do that.

293
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,274
What about the press opinion?

294
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:05,714
It's a battle.
They're split right in half.

295
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:08,154
They're attacking you more.

296
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:13,914
Tell everyone I'll give interviews,
even if they're hostile to me.

297
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:17,114
Mr. Yun, finish the Gangbuk
development plan.

298
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:20,954
Mr. Gi, check the districts that are
advantageous and disadvantageous.

299
00:25:21,074 --> 00:25:22,354
- Okay.
- Okay.

300
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:23,954
That's it.

301
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:25,754
Just a minute.

302
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:28,274
Mr. Lee, Mr. Gi.

303
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:35,514
Give me a report of the campaign
strategy and budget by today.

304
00:25:35,762 --> 00:25:37,034
That's...

305
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:41,674
Isn't that too excessive a request?

306
00:25:41,794 --> 00:25:43,754
Why is it excessive?

307
00:25:44,514 --> 00:25:49,194
I have the right to know everything.

308
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,074
- But...
- Do it.

309
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:54,474
- Honey...
- Do it.

310
00:25:56,914 --> 00:26:01,074
Seeing from Gyeonggi,
prospects aren't that negative.

311
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:07,834
The party members still
overwhelmingly support you.

312
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:11,074
2,320 votes...

313
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:13,274
Will I be able to maintain this lead?

314
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:19,154
Yes, you can.
You have to make the gap larger.

315
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:22,394
Too bad about the votes I lost
in Chungcheong.

316
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,545
Don't think about that anymore.

317
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:28,314
I'm sure Jang Iljun has weaknesses.

318
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,834
Do you have a plan?

319
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:34,034
No, not yet.

320
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,874
It's the Blue House.

321
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:46,714
This is Baek Changi.

322
00:26:48,554 --> 00:26:51,234
You know how elections are.

323
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:54,434
Today?

324
00:26:57,234 --> 00:27:01,114
Aren't you meeting Ms. Shin's
demands too much?

325
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:04,274
I have no choice.
She's my partner.

326
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:08,474
She's acting like she's in charge.

327
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:12,394
She's just like that because
she used to be a prosecutor.

328
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:17,834
Acting like a prosecutor.

329
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:21,114
She should be cooperating,
not investigating or interrogating us.

330
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:24,634
It's alright.
We don't have anything to hide.

331
00:27:26,154 --> 00:27:34,154
She might not be flexible,
but people like her for her principles.

332
00:27:34,274 --> 00:27:40,194
I beat Kim Gyeongmo because
she joined me.

333
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:43,794
We have to embrace her
even if we don't want to.

334
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:47,514
Okay, never mind.

335
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:50,634
About the party members.

336
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:54,954
How about meeting the president?

337
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:59,754
It worked in Gangwon.

338
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:04,954
I thought about it, but not now.

339
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:05,834
Why not?

340
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:09,634
I got a vote using a crippled
election as a weapon.

341
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:13,834
I won't get it now, but it would
be dangerous to get it, too.

342
00:28:13,954 --> 00:28:14,714
Why?

343
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:22,314
I can't guess what he'd want.
He won't support me for no reason.

344
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:29,634
How are you?

345
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:33,714
Mr. Kim.
Good job.

346
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:35,674
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

347
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:44,234
Our party election is very popular.
Everyone is talking about it.

348
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:52,274
I didn't expect Jang Iljun to
get so many votes.

349
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:55,474
Why did you want to see me?

350
00:28:55,594 --> 00:28:58,434
What's the rush?

351
00:28:58,554 --> 00:29:01,754
Let's have a cup of tea.

352
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:06,274
I want to hear about the election.

353
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:11,154
As you know, I don't have
time to sleep these days.

354
00:29:11,914 --> 00:29:13,234
I know.

355
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:19,554
You can't have a leisurely
drink until it's over.

356
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:31,114
I see your pledge is the practical
prime minister system.

357
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:33,794
That's right.

358
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:38,834
Do you have a candidate?

359
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:44,634
there was someone I thought of,
but it didn't work out.

360
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:47,954
I'm still thinking about it.

361
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:51,234
Should I recommend someone?

362
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:53,594
How?

363
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:56,794
How about Choi Jeonguk?

364
00:29:58,354 --> 00:30:03,154
Choi Jeonguk?
The First Lady's older brother?

365
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:13,194
He has a lot of political experience
and he's prudent.

366
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:16,154
I'm sure he'll support you well.

367
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:20,514
He was imprisoned for taking bribes.

368
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:29,154
He was pardoned.
All politicians have faults.

369
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:37,234
What is the vote difference right now?

370
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:41,394
About 2,000 votes?

371
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,754
How did it go?

372
00:30:58,474 --> 00:31:00,394
I said how did it go?

373
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:02,234
He's going to think about it.

374
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:06,874
What for?
He should give an answer right away.

375
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:09,994
He can't give an answer right away.

376
00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:15,234
The Seoul party election is soon.
He should decide quickly.

377
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:17,594
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?

378
00:31:17,714 --> 00:31:20,634
As if you don't know.
Jang Iljun.

379
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:26,634
I'm telling you Kim Gyeongmo
is better than Jang Iljun.

380
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:29,434
Jang Iljun can't be trusted.

381
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,034
That's what you think.

382
00:31:32,154 --> 00:31:37,074
Just give him one day.
Can't you wait a day?

383
00:31:42,474 --> 00:31:45,234
Use this as expenses.

384
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:52,634
- Professor Jo, this is...
- What?

385
00:31:53,474 --> 00:31:55,234
It's too much.

386
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:58,714
You have to think of the
presidential election, too.

387
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:02,154
This could become a problem.

388
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:06,874
Don't worry.
I made sure there won't be any problems.

389
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:09,274
Still, it's too risky.

390
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:15,354
They're spending a lot more than us
right now.

391
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:17,914
This isn't your first election.

392
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:22,594
If there's light, there has to be
darkness too.

393
00:32:23,914 --> 00:32:29,674
Keep this an absolute secret.

394
00:32:35,794 --> 00:32:38,634
First Lady, hello.

395
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:43,154
I'm sorry I haven't called.

396
00:32:45,874 --> 00:32:46,874
Hon...

397
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:49,794
What is it?

398
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:53,314
Can I talk to you?

399
00:32:57,154 --> 00:32:59,194
Is it something I can't hear?

400
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:01,714
It has to do with our children.

401
00:33:01,834 --> 00:33:03,634
Does it?

402
00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:06,394
Ms. Shin.

403
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:07,954
Okay.

404
00:33:09,394 --> 00:33:13,594
I guess family matters come up.

405
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:16,834
I'll leave you for a while.

406
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:46,354
The president spoke to Kim Gyeongmo?

407
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:49,634
Yes, this afternoon.

408
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:58,074
The First Lady wants to talk to us.
She'll try to convince the President.

409
00:33:58,194 --> 00:33:59,514
What's the reason?

410
00:33:59,634 --> 00:34:07,594
She didn't say, but the President
has the most power right now.

411
00:34:08,954 --> 00:34:13,634
Let's see him and see what he wants.

412
00:34:13,754 --> 00:34:15,194
Let's think about it.

413
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:18,954
There's no time.
Kim Gyeongmo already met him.

414
00:34:19,074 --> 00:34:20,794
We could be too late.

415
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:24,594
I don't know what the President asked,

416
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:30,474
but the First Lady wouldn't
have called us if Kim Gyeongmo said yes.

417
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:34,714
This is a risky deal.
We have to be careful.

418
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,954
Choi Jeonguk?

419
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:45,794
Yes, the First Lady's older brother.

420
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:53,714
The President is crazy.

421
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:56,394
Who's the person who made
the government like this?

422
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,954
It's because he was in the Blue House.

423
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:04,114
I quit being Prime Minister
because I didn't want to see that.

424
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:07,234
He wants me to take him in?

425
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:10,914
I can't accept this.

426
00:35:11,034 --> 00:35:15,154
You should.

427
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:17,314
Mr. Baek.

428
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,954
You have to.

429
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:23,594
Are you crazy?

430
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:29,594
What will the people say if I
choose him as Prime Minister?

431
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:33,794
I can't have a corrupt person in
my government.

432
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:38,794
That's a later problem.
You have to win this election first.

433
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:44,354
Who do you think they'll ask
if you say no?

434
00:35:44,474 --> 00:35:46,674
Jang Iljun.

435
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:49,314
All we have right now are
the votes of the party members.

436
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:54,394
If we lose those,
there will be no hope.

437
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:58,674
I can't do that even if I lose.

438
00:35:59,714 --> 00:36:01,594
Even if you lose.

439
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:05,434
How can you say that so easily?

440
00:36:06,634 --> 00:36:13,194
What about all those people
who supported you all this time?

441
00:36:13,314 --> 00:36:16,274
- Do you know how much money was spent?
- Mr. Baek!

442
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:21,754
Expenses, salaries, meals,
promotions, labor, etc.

443
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:24,834
Do you think all that happens by itself?

444
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:29,594
Just remember this.

445
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:34,434
The minute you lose,
you can just leave.

446
00:36:34,554 --> 00:36:52,354
But hundreds and thousands of people
will be disappointed with you forever.

447
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,361
Hi, Seongmin.

448
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:14,994
Are mom and dad in Seoul?

449
00:37:15,114 --> 00:37:17,842
They came this morning.

450
00:37:17,962 --> 00:37:19,794
Oh, no.

451
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:22,874
I have a favor to ask.

452
00:37:22,994 --> 00:37:27,674
Dad's watch and tie pin are
in my desk drawer.

453
00:37:27,794 --> 00:37:29,354
Why?

454
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:33,834
Are you crazy? The safe?

455
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:36,971
How important is the watch?

456
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:39,114
Grandfather gave it to father.

457
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:42,754
Why did you take it?

458
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:48,194
I have a girlfriend.
I wanted to show off.

459
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:52,714
I can't go home right now.
Can you put it back for me.

460
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:55,554
You're crazy.

461
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,754
What's the combination?

462
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:00,754
Okay.

463
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:03,114
You're asking for trouble.

464
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,714
This is Baek Changi.

465
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:34,674
Mr. Baek.

466
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:38,194
What can I do for you?

467
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:39,954
Have a seat.

468
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,634
What do you want?
I'm a little busy.

469
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:52,234
Don't be so stiff.

470
00:38:53,794 --> 00:39:04,074
My life is messed up because
Shin Huiju joined Jang Iljun.

471
00:39:05,114 --> 00:39:10,674
You're going to have to take me in.

472
00:39:10,794 --> 00:39:17,114
I still have some power among
the conservatives in the party.

473
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:24,754
I know, but Mr. Kim doesn't like you.
I can't help you.

474
00:39:24,874 --> 00:39:27,969
You saw his attitude last time.

475
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:33,234
That's his opinion.
You should help.

476
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:36,794
You can control him.

477
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:42,634
Why should I?

478
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:46,994
Did you forget?

479
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:51,953
You're the one who told me
about Ju Ilran.

480
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:56,194
That's it?

481
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,194
You're so naive.

482
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,874
Mr. Kim already knows about that.

483
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:10,714
What if I tell the press?

484
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:16,034
Look here, do you have proof?

485
00:40:16,154 --> 00:40:20,634
You'll only be spitting on your own
face.

486
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,874
Go ahead, if you want to.

487
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:25,794
You...

488
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:36,594
Fine, I'll see what I can do.

489
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,234
Really?

490
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:42,314
But I have one favor.

491
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:44,314
A favor?
What is it?

492
00:40:44,434 --> 00:40:48,874
Go to Jang Iljun's office and
say hello.

493
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:50,354
What?

494
00:40:51,154 --> 00:40:53,314
What am I supposed to do?

495
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:54,114
What is Director Yu's picture...

496
00:41:55,754 --> 00:41:57,394
What are you doing?

497
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:09,754
Who said you could open the safe?

498
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:12,794
Mom, it's not what you think.

499
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,514
We have to talk.

500
00:42:37,634 --> 00:42:41,874
So, Seongmin knows the combination?

501
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,234
Don't scold him.

502
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:47,794
He was just trying to show off
to his girlfriend.

503
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:52,314
Then I guess he saw the picture, too.

504
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:55,394
I don't know.

505
00:42:56,114 --> 00:42:58,834
He probably didn't.

506
00:42:59,594 --> 00:43:01,754
He would have said so if he had.

507
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:05,954
He would have asked about it.

508
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,674
Mom...

509
00:43:09,794 --> 00:43:13,874
I'm curious, too.

510
00:43:15,114 --> 00:43:18,154
Listen carefully.

511
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:22,634
Forget what you saw.
You didn't see anything.

512
00:43:22,754 --> 00:43:23,504
Mom...

513
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:28,274
Listen to me.
Nobody must know about this.

514
00:43:28,394 --> 00:43:32,434
Not your father, not Director Yu,
not Seongmin, not Sebin.

515
00:43:32,554 --> 00:43:33,674
Why?

516
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:38,714
I'm sure a day will come to explain
after the election.

517
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:46,634
Then, you'll also know why I told you
not to date him, but not now.

518
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:51,514
Don't ask any questions and
just listen to me for now, okay?

519
00:43:53,274 --> 00:43:55,034
Do you understand?

520
00:43:56,274 --> 00:44:01,194
Okay, if that's what you want.

521
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:11,394
Come in.

522
00:44:16,194 --> 00:44:17,674
What is it?

523
00:44:18,354 --> 00:44:20,314
Aren't you going home?

524
00:44:20,434 --> 00:44:23,474
I think I'll have to stay up
all night tonight.

525
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,514
Go ahead.

526
00:44:25,634 --> 00:44:26,834
Okay.

527
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:33,594
Do you have something to say?

528
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:38,914
Don't overdo it.
You shouldn't get sick.

529
00:44:39,434 --> 00:44:43,594
Don't worry,
I don't have time to get sick.

530
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,834
Okay.
Good night.

531
00:44:55,594 --> 00:44:57,954
Director Yu, what are you doing?

532
00:44:58,074 --> 00:45:01,554
I just said good night to Mr. Jang.
Are you going home?

533
00:45:01,674 --> 00:45:07,434
I'll only get a couple of hours
of sleep, but I want to see my children.

534
00:45:07,554 --> 00:45:11,354
It must be nice to have a family.

535
00:45:12,834 --> 00:45:16,794
- Yes. See you.
- Bye.

536
00:45:28,754 --> 00:45:30,154
Hello?

537
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,994
<i>Didn't you sleep yet?</i>

538
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:38,154
Mr. Kim, what can I do for you
at this hour?

539
00:45:38,274 --> 00:45:42,434
<i>I couldn't sleep.
Let's meet.</i>

540
00:45:55,034 --> 00:45:56,754
Hello, Mr. Jang.

541
00:45:59,354 --> 00:46:02,394
I know this place well.
Nobody else will come.

542
00:46:02,514 --> 00:46:07,314
You didn't call me because you needed
someone to drink with, did you?

543
00:46:08,034 --> 00:46:11,394
Maybe. Have a seat.

544
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:23,434
Do you enjoy politics?

545
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:27,074
I don't do politics for fun.

546
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:30,234
But it should be worth it.

547
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:36,274
I started later than you.
I can't seem to adapt.

548
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:39,537
I'm already starting to hate it.

549
00:46:39,657 --> 00:46:43,154
Then you can quit and support me.

550
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:48,474
I've come too far to do that.

551
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:51,914
Too many people are making
sacrifices for me.

552
00:46:52,954 --> 00:46:55,514
What is it that you want to say?

553
00:46:57,674 --> 00:47:02,394
You know I went to
the Blue House, right?

554
00:47:03,074 --> 00:47:07,114
You have a source there.

555
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:09,834
I'm sure you heard.

556
00:47:12,114 --> 00:47:15,954
Yes. I was curious.

557
00:47:16,074 --> 00:47:19,634
I wondered how much of a bind the
President would put me in.

558
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,634
The goal is Prime Minister.

559
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:23,834
Prime Minister?

560
00:47:23,954 --> 00:47:27,474
Choi Jeonguk, the First Lady's brother.

561
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:30,514
Choi Jeonguk?

562
00:47:32,954 --> 00:47:34,594
How can they want someone like him?

563
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:36,194
Right?

564
00:47:38,234 --> 00:47:42,034
They don't want to
let go of their power.

565
00:47:45,194 --> 00:47:48,394
Are you going to accept?

566
00:47:48,514 --> 00:47:50,154
No.

567
00:47:51,114 --> 00:47:54,434
I wouldn't unless I was crazy.

568
00:47:55,474 --> 00:48:03,674
The problem is even if I refuse,
the offer will be made to you.

569
00:48:05,154 --> 00:48:13,074
We are enemies right now.

570
00:48:13,794 --> 00:48:19,274
But I don't think you're so low
that you'd accept such an offer.

571
00:48:20,034 --> 00:48:23,154
You can't accept this offer.

572
00:48:23,274 --> 00:48:25,154
Of course not.

573
00:48:25,274 --> 00:48:31,594
I want to start my government,
not inherit corrupt people.

574
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:32,554
Do you mean that?

575
00:48:32,674 --> 00:48:34,154
Of course.

576
00:48:34,274 --> 00:48:38,714
If I accept that, the new government
will have a bad start.

577
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:42,314
Let's agree on this.

578
00:48:43,714 --> 00:48:47,834
I will reject the President's offer
and any support.

579
00:48:49,354 --> 00:48:52,634
Can you do that, too?

580
00:48:53,114 --> 00:48:58,394
We can't abandon righteousness.

581
00:48:58,514 --> 00:49:05,074
I agree with you completely.
Let's fight the President together.

582
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:19,234
- Mr. Gi.
- Yes.

583
00:49:19,354 --> 00:49:22,394
How many suits do we have
against Kim Gyeongmo?

584
00:49:22,514 --> 00:49:28,994
I'm not sure, but dozens including
what happened at district chapters.

585
00:49:29,114 --> 00:49:31,114
Drop them all.

586
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,274
What are you talking about?

587
00:49:33,394 --> 00:49:36,394
Why are you dropping the suits
instead of punishing crimes?

588
00:49:36,514 --> 00:49:40,194
There was a request from the party.

589
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:41,394
What request?

590
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:45,954
They want us to refrain a bit.

591
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:49,114
Fighting amongst ourselves would
only do the opposition party good.

592
00:49:49,234 --> 00:49:54,154
We can only drop the suits,
if they do the same.

593
00:49:54,274 --> 00:49:56,892
They will.
Talk to them.

594
00:49:57,012 --> 00:49:58,097
Yes, sir.

595
00:49:58,217 --> 00:49:59,594
Wait a minute.

596
00:50:00,674 --> 00:50:04,194
I can't agree to this.

597
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:09,234
You can't agree to forget about crimes.

598
00:50:09,714 --> 00:50:13,114
This is why the same crimes
occur again and again.

599
00:50:13,234 --> 00:50:16,314
If you abide by the law, the election
culture can change.

600
00:50:16,434 --> 00:50:21,674
You're right, but go with me this time.

601
00:50:21,794 --> 00:50:25,594
It's already been agreed to
by Kim Gyeongmo.

602
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:34,434
Do you believe him?

603
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:39,274
Jang Iljun betrayed you before.
How can you trust him now?

604
00:50:39,394 --> 00:50:44,394
If he accepts this,
he will be just as burdened.

605
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:46,874
He's not that stupid.

606
00:50:46,994 --> 00:50:49,434
He always does the unexpected.

607
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:55,154
I can't accept the President's offer.

608
00:50:56,674 --> 00:50:58,274
I have to give an answer.

609
00:50:58,394 --> 00:50:59,994
You can't do that.

610
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:01,834
Mr. Baek!

611
00:51:01,954 --> 00:51:05,554
If you're going to refuse,
wait a little while.

612
00:51:05,674 --> 00:51:10,474
You can refuse when Jang Iljun refuses.

613
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:22,154
- You're really busy, aren't you?
- Yes.

614
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:24,714
Go in order.

615
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:32,194
Dobong-gu, Gwangjin-gu,
Seongdong-gu, Seodaemun-gu.

616
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:37,154
Forget what you saw.
You didn't see anything.

617
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:37,874
Mom.

618
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:42,474
Listen to me.
Nobody can know about this.

619
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:43,474
Why?

620
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:48,594
I'm sure a day will come to explain
after the election.

621
00:51:48,714 --> 00:51:54,874
Then, you'll also know why I told
you not to date him, but not now.

622
00:51:56,674 --> 00:51:59,754
Everyone is working hard.

623
00:52:00,354 --> 00:52:02,954
There are so many pretty women.

624
00:52:08,594 --> 00:52:11,834
Mr. Jang, it's nice to see you.

625
00:52:13,034 --> 00:52:16,274
Ms. Shin, you're here, too.

626
00:52:17,194 --> 00:52:19,994
You're campaigning well these days.

627
00:52:20,114 --> 00:52:25,314
I brought an orchid for you.
It's a very precious orchid.

628
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:28,994
I'm sure you didn't come just for that.

629
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:32,474
Well...

630
00:52:33,714 --> 00:52:37,634
Can we talk?

631
00:52:40,794 --> 00:52:42,554
This is the perfect spot.

632
00:52:42,674 --> 00:52:45,154
What do you want?

633
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:48,514
Don't I get a cup of tea?

634
00:52:48,634 --> 00:52:50,674
What do you want?

635
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:57,674
I was wondering if there was
anything I could do to help you.

636
00:52:57,794 --> 00:52:58,634
Help me?

637
00:52:58,754 --> 00:53:02,194
Think about it.

638
00:53:02,314 --> 00:53:08,154
Shin Huiju merged with me first.

639
00:53:08,274 --> 00:53:12,674
Then she merged with you.

640
00:53:12,794 --> 00:53:19,914
I should go where she goes.
It's natural that I'm here.

641
00:53:21,754 --> 00:53:23,994
You're really something.

642
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:28,754
Don't you remember what you did
to me with Ju Ilran?

643
00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:32,634
You already forgave me for that.

644
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:37,394
Forgiving you is different from
accepting you in my office.

645
00:53:40,514 --> 00:53:44,154
I know Baek Changi was behind it.

646
00:53:44,274 --> 00:53:49,034
Go to him.
You shouldn't be here.

647
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:54,594
I came with good intentions.

648
00:53:55,874 --> 00:54:01,154
Have a nice life.

649
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,874
He didn't call yet, did he?

650
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,554
Forget it.

651
00:54:28,674 --> 00:54:32,954
Don't wait for a boat that won't come.
Get a new boat.

652
00:54:34,874 --> 00:54:37,754
I really can't trust Jang Iljun.

653
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:42,194
You're making me nervous.
Listen to me.

654
00:54:42,314 --> 00:54:45,914
Forget about Kim Gyeongmo.

655
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:56,114
Does he think he can win
without me?

656
00:55:00,914 --> 00:55:05,034
Should we count the suits or
should we just say it's even?

657
00:55:06,314 --> 00:55:09,074
We're busy.
Let's just settle it all at once.

658
00:55:09,194 --> 00:55:10,354
Fine.

659
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:14,274
This is very uncomfortable.
Let's settle this quickly.

660
00:55:20,434 --> 00:55:25,034
What are your intentions?

661
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:28,834
Are you really going to reject
the President?

662
00:55:29,514 --> 00:55:31,194
What are you talking about?

663
00:55:31,314 --> 00:55:34,554
Are you pretending or
do you really not know?

664
00:55:38,994 --> 00:55:41,434
I guess you really don't know.

665
00:55:43,074 --> 00:55:46,674
I guess you're not in a high
enough position to know.

666
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:54,434
Let's be fair this time.
No fouls, okay?

667
00:55:55,354 --> 00:55:59,634
Does the word fair suit us?

668
00:55:59,754 --> 00:56:08,074
That's true, but let's try to be
fair in the Seoul party election.

669
00:56:09,234 --> 00:56:12,114
You can't beat me with your skills.

670
00:56:12,234 --> 00:56:17,434
I stepped all over you 5 years ago.
Did you forget already?

671
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:20,314
You didn't use skills.
You used petty tricks.

672
00:56:20,914 --> 00:56:23,074
I learned a lot.

673
00:56:23,194 --> 00:56:25,234
Then you should be grateful.

674
00:56:26,354 --> 00:56:31,994
I'll beat you with skills this time.

675
00:56:32,634 --> 00:56:34,994
So you have nothing to say.

676
00:56:51,794 --> 00:56:53,874
This is Baek Changi.

677
00:56:54,634 --> 00:56:56,914
Did you do it?

678
00:56:59,514 --> 00:57:00,954
Good job.

679
00:57:01,074 --> 00:57:04,554
You can join me after the
Seoul party election.

680
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:14,954
Fight fairly with skills? You?

681
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:22,274
Everyone knows we merged.
We don't have to go everywhere together.

682
00:57:22,394 --> 00:57:27,074
- We can split up to save time.
- Good.

683
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,994
Where should I go?

684
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:32,154
- This area?
- Here. I'll go here.

685
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:52,314
Get the strong areas.
I'll take the weak areas.

686
00:57:52,914 --> 00:57:59,754
Okay, let's meet back at the
office at 10 pm.

687
00:57:59,874 --> 00:58:02,314
Okay.
Be careful in the cold.

688
00:58:02,434 --> 00:58:04,354
- You, too.
- Okay.

689
00:58:04,474 --> 00:58:06,074
Honey.

690
00:58:06,194 --> 00:58:09,314
You're going to have to cancel
the street promotions today.

691
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:12,354
I was just heading out.
Why?

692
00:58:15,914 --> 00:58:18,234
Family matters again?

693
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:20,794
I'll go ahead.

694
00:58:31,754 --> 00:58:34,954
The Blue House called.
They want to meet.

695
00:58:35,514 --> 00:58:36,874
When?

696
00:58:36,994 --> 00:58:39,794
9 pm.
What should I say?

697
00:58:41,354 --> 00:58:43,634
I'll have to meet them.

698
00:58:46,874 --> 00:58:51,394
Jang Iljun is going to the Blue House.

699
00:58:52,554 --> 00:58:55,634
He's going to meet the President
at 9 pm.

700
00:58:55,754 --> 00:58:56,714
How do you know that?

701
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:59,154
That's not important.

702
00:58:59,634 --> 00:59:03,234
What will you do if he accepts
the President's offer?

703
00:59:03,354 --> 00:59:05,274
He won't.

704
00:59:06,474 --> 00:59:07,754
I trust him.

705
00:59:07,874 --> 00:59:09,634
What if he does?

706
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,074
What if?

707
00:59:12,994 --> 00:59:15,594
Then I will, too.

708
00:59:15,714 --> 00:59:19,754
If he betrays me, I can't just
sit back and let him.

709
00:59:20,914 --> 00:59:22,634
We'll both have to roll in the mud.

710
00:59:22,754 --> 00:59:24,714
Even if Jang Iljun says yes first?

711
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:30,034
I don't know about the First Lady,
but the President is still on my side.

712
00:59:30,674 --> 00:59:35,634
If we both accept, then he'll choose me.

713
00:59:38,554 --> 00:59:41,514
How did you find out?

714
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:44,674
I cheated a bit.

715
00:59:47,954 --> 00:59:50,034
[Blue House]

716
00:59:50,154 --> 00:59:51,994
Hello, Mr. Jang.

717
00:59:54,954 --> 00:59:56,194
How have you been?

718
00:59:56,314 --> 00:59:59,394
It's nice to see you.
How about a handshake?

719
01:00:01,594 --> 01:00:05,194
You've gotten stronger.

720
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:07,954
I'm shaking hands all day.

721
01:00:08,074 --> 01:00:12,794
I know how it is.
You'll be shaking many more.

722
01:00:13,994 --> 01:00:18,754
Professor Jo, you look well
for all the hard work.

723
01:00:18,874 --> 01:00:20,394
Is it because you got a lot of votes?

724
01:00:20,514 --> 01:00:23,074
It's a lot of hard work.

725
01:00:23,194 --> 01:00:27,874
It should be over with soon.
Are the children well?

726
01:00:46,074 --> 01:00:47,994
Isn't this a bit too much?

727
01:00:50,354 --> 01:00:51,474
What?

728
01:00:51,594 --> 01:00:53,994
You didn't say a single word.

729
01:00:54,954 --> 01:01:00,514
We broke up, but we're not enemies.

730
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:03,194
Inyeong...

731
01:01:03,314 --> 01:01:05,594
Did you...

732
01:01:07,594 --> 01:01:11,234
Did you know my mom before?

733
01:01:12,194 --> 01:01:14,954
What are you talking about?

734
01:01:15,954 --> 01:01:17,754
Nothing.

735
01:01:18,594 --> 01:01:20,514
I'm going in.

736
01:01:20,634 --> 01:01:22,394
Wait.

737
01:01:26,114 --> 01:01:28,114
Do you hate me that much?

738
01:01:28,874 --> 01:01:29,914
No.

739
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:32,354
Then why won't you even look
at me?

740
01:01:32,954 --> 01:01:33,634
Since that day...

741
01:01:33,754 --> 01:01:39,354
I said everything I wanted to.

742
01:01:40,594 --> 01:01:46,074
Let's not hurt each other again.
I'm asking you.

743
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:09,754
Seongmin, what happened?

744
01:02:09,874 --> 01:02:10,674
What?

745
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:14,474
You didn't come home.
Mom's really mad.

746
01:02:14,594 --> 01:02:15,834
Why?

747
01:02:15,954 --> 01:02:18,354
Well...

748
01:02:18,754 --> 01:02:21,954
Did you tell her about the watch?

749
01:02:22,074 --> 01:02:23,834
No, but...

750
01:02:23,954 --> 01:02:26,434
Okay, then.
I have to go.

751
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:30,514
Seongmin!

752
01:02:33,994 --> 01:02:37,514
I was surprised to see what happened.

753
01:02:37,994 --> 01:02:42,234
- That Ju Ilran woman...
- Oh...

754
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:45,714
You avoided the scandal well.

755
01:02:45,834 --> 01:02:48,754
I thought Mr. Jang would have
to drop out.

756
01:02:48,874 --> 01:02:51,274
It was all a lie.

757
01:02:51,394 --> 01:02:55,234
Do you trust him?

758
01:02:55,914 --> 01:02:58,674
Of course, I do.

759
01:02:58,794 --> 01:03:00,434
I envy you.

760
01:03:00,954 --> 01:03:06,554
I don't trust my husband.
I just need him as a partner.

761
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:09,834
You've lived together for 40 years.

762
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:15,154
Marital emotions get in the way
of political partnerships.

763
01:03:15,634 --> 01:03:18,514
You'll find out when you live here.

764
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:22,594
What's most charming here isn't
a man or a woman.

765
01:03:22,714 --> 01:03:25,314
It's power.

766
01:03:26,554 --> 01:03:35,514
It's an erotic monster that steps
all over petty human emotions.

767
01:03:36,954 --> 01:03:40,274
I like the fierceness of power.

768
01:03:41,154 --> 01:03:43,234
Don't you?

769
01:03:44,114 --> 01:03:46,954
I'm still lacking.

770
01:03:51,714 --> 01:03:53,354
Choi Jeonguk?

771
01:03:53,474 --> 01:03:56,434
Yes. What do you think?

772
01:03:59,234 --> 01:03:59,994
Well...

773
01:04:00,114 --> 01:04:10,354
I'm sure it burdens you,
but think about the reality.

774
01:04:10,474 --> 01:04:15,274
You're a quick person.

775
01:04:18,674 --> 01:04:26,794
I know it could put you in a bind.
The opposition party would oppose.

776
01:04:27,594 --> 01:04:32,034
But you can do anything when
you first take power.

777
01:04:32,154 --> 01:04:35,474
You have the most support of
the people at that time.

778
01:04:37,314 --> 01:04:42,714
You made the same offer to
Kim Gyeongmo, too, didn't you?

779
01:04:45,194 --> 01:04:47,434
Maybe.

780
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:53,114
Practical benefits or future burdens.
That's the choice.

781
01:04:53,234 --> 01:04:54,994
Right.

782
01:04:56,514 --> 01:05:04,794
Kim Gyeongmo is a gentle horse,
but he has no instinct to race.

783
01:05:05,874 --> 01:05:09,558
You're different.
