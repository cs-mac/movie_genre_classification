will be ancient history.

164
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,590
I wonder what people will make of it?

165
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,755
It doesn't seem that long

166
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,990
since I was putting his dad
to bed in the same room.

167
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,555
I'm sorry.

168

(BABY COOING)

169
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,476
My father died for
something he believed in

170
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,834
so I'm sad, but

171
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,868
I'm proud, too.

172
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,080
Just like little Thomas
will be when his dad comes home.

173
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,429
All the officers have been
called back to the command centre.

174
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,789
You think this is it?

175
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,358
Something's happening.

176
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,951
I can't believe he's coming home.

177
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,072
- Nothing's been announced yet.
- The papers say it's over.

178
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,630
Well, the fighting doesn't just stop,
they have to agree terms.

179
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,798
The price may be more than
we're willing to pay.

180
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,029
But we have no choice.

181
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,839
Choice or not, they're politicians
so it's going to take time.

182
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,320
They won't keep fighting, will they?
Not while they're talking.

183
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,470
- Probably.
- But that's stupid!

184
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,233
If everyone knows it's over,
why let more boys die?

185
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,719
That's not the way they see it.

186
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,189
Why not? Don't they have children?

187
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,709
Writing home?

188
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,190
Maybe if the rumours are true
I won't have to post it.

189
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,755
I can take it myself. (CHUCKLING)

190
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,276
But who knows
what we'll be going back to.

191
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,308
Does it matter?

192
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,675
As long as we're home.

193
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,832
It won't be the home we left,
if we lose this war.

194
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,319
There's no food,

195
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,309
no jobs.

196
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,719
My wife will be there.

197
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,832
Everything else we can just
rebuild, in time.

198
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,394
Right now I'd settle for
sitting in front of a warm fire.

199
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,239
Kaiser Bill's chucked the towel in boys!
We've got them on the run!

200
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,199
- What's that mean, Sergeant?
- Means he's abdicated.

201
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,038
They'll be like headless chickens now.

202
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,394
We'll be home by Christmas.

203

205
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,275
Did you hear?

206
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,988
I heard.

207
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,675
So that's it, then.

208
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,755
They haven't told us to start
packing up to go home yet.

209
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,231
Yeah, but they will do, won't they?
If the Kaiser's gone,

210
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,714
that's good isn't it?

211
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,790
Yeah. It's good.

Looked in my diary this morning
and saw it was Monday.

Damn.
Missed Sunday roast again yesterday.

They were shelling us
this time yesterday.

234
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,556
Maybe they're having a lie-in.

- Morning, boys.
- Sergeant.

236
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,629
Looks like a shell's taken out
a section of the wire.

237

It's your turn, Del.

238
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,199
It's all right, Sergeant, I'll do it.

239
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,519
Dead in line with the next elbow,

240
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,670
you should be able to
pull it back together and tie it.

It's all quiet over there
but keep your head down

in case they've got a sniper on watch.

Don't worry about that.

You didn't have to do that,
it's my turn.

245

You'd only get tangled up in the wire

246
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,913
and I'd have to come and get you anyway.
