1
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:10,855
- Ivy!
- Hi, Mom.

2
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,024
Hi, sweetheart.

3
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:19,614
Hey, Mom, two tests again, both in math.

4
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:22,325
They popped one on us.
Can you believe it?

5
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,244
You're kidding? No warning at all?

6
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,914
No, they didn't.

7
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,500
Come on, sweetie.

8
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:50,895
Hello, George.

9
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:57,485
No, Paris. Well, at least
that's what Jennifer told Peter.

10
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:05,451
By the way, dear Jill O'Connor
says she's started to... you know what.

11
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:08,496
- No, what?
- Menstruate.

12
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:12,833
- She's only nine. Do you believe it?
- No, I think she's a fibber.

13
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,253
- She's a liar.
- I didn't say that.

14
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:19,173
Girls like Jill just like to fantasise.

15
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:30,601
Hey.

16
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:33,938
- How about a Coke?
- I'll have it later.

17
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:36,107
OK.

18
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,696
Oh, Ivy, don't forget
to hang your coat on a chair.

19
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:43,864
Oh, all right.

20
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,208
- Open up.
- Bill...

21
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:59,588
Oh!

22
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:04,677
- Hey, what is it? You're shaking.
- It's just the weather.

23
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:09,849
You're home early. Well,
I'll get a glass chilling for your martini.

24
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:14,437
- Oh, don't mention that word, please.
- Another one of those days?

25
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:17,940
- Yeah, another one of those lunches.
- Oh...

26
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:21,610
- I gotta lie down, Janice.
- You've got an hour.

27
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:24,613
Carole and Russ are coming for dinner.
With their aunt.

28
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:26,866
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry.

29
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,035
No, no.

30
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:34,457
- Hiya, princess.
- Hi, Daddy.

31
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,336
- I found out.
- What?

32
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:41,922
Mom...

33
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:44,091
- Mom likes cameras, right?
- Right.

34
00:08:44,216 --> 00:08:46,427
I was walking with her
past a camera store

35
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:49,180
and I saw her looking
at this real long lens.

36
00:08:49,305 --> 00:08:53,768
It's so neat.
It's got all these little dinkies on it.

37
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:56,228
- Little dinkies like that.
- Yeah?

38
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,606
When can we buy it?

39
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:03,110
- Well, it's an awful long way to Christmas.
- Yeah.

40
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:06,864
But your birthday's next week.
Have you made up your mind yet?

41
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:10,534
Yeah, but I'm not gonna tell you.

42
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:15,956
- All right...
- Surprise me.

43
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:25,132
The Hotel des Artistes,
built by artistes for artistes.

44
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:27,259
What the hell are we doing here?

45
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:29,929
I don't know about you,
but I have hidden depths.

46
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,139
Mezzo, mezzo.

47
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:53,577
Excuse me.

48
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,458
We've got to go, Bill. Come along, Aunt.

49
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:09,051
Ivy. Ivy.

50
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:12,096
Ivy. Sweetie.

51
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,724
It's Mommy.

52
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:20,813
- Oh, Mom, it was awful.
- What was awful?

53
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,442
I don't know.

54
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,904
I can't remember.

55
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,949
Well, it was just a dream.

56
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:36,328
- Yeah, a dream.
- Mm-hm.

57
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:40,207
Mom, I don't feel well.

58
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,587
- You don't seem to have a fever.
- Darn.

59
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:48,924
But I think we'll keep you home
from school tomorrow anyway.

60
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,676
I love you.

61
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,262
Oh, I love you too.

62
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,268
Bill...

63
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:05,441
Something strange happened today.
There was a man outside school.

64
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,526
Bill?

65
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:24,019
He has reddish-brown hair,
pale blue eyes, he's about 5'8, 5'9.

66
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:30,359
A beard, rather a full beard. Kind of
a weird, spaced-out look about him.

67
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,737
Well, when did you first notice him?

68
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:37,366
A couple of weeks ago. I spotted him
on the bus. I was going home.

69
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:41,119
He looked rather familiar,
like I'd seen him somewhere before.

70
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,831
The next day,
he was in the elevator where I work.

71
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:45,332
Where's that?

72
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:49,336
386 Madison Avenue. I'm a partner
in Simmons Templeton Advertising.

73
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:53,006
- Well, maybe he works there too.
- No.

74
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:56,760
Now I see him every morning
when I take my daughter to school.

75
00:12:56,885 --> 00:13:01,515
- Has this person ever battered you?
- Battered me?

76
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,520
Has he come into
purposeful bodily contact with you?

77
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:10,607
Has he hit you? Has he pushed you?

78
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:12,943
No, nothing like that.

79
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:18,991
Unless there's evidence of assault and
battery, there's very little we can do here.

80
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:23,161
What do I do? What? Do I shove him,
push him, provoke him?

81
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:27,374
Get the son of a bitch to hit me? What
does it take to get you to do something?

82
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:30,043
Look, Mr Templeton, I'm sorry,

83
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:34,131
but there's no law that says
that people can't be on the city streets

84
00:13:34,256 --> 00:13:37,759
wherever and whenever they'd like to be.

85
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:48,478
- I got one.
- OK.

86
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:50,689
Look, Mom, "slaughter".

87
00:13:52,357 --> 00:13:55,819
- Oh! That's good.
- 13.

88
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:01,825
Be right back. No peeking at my pieces.

89
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:04,911
Hello?

90
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:09,291
- Hello?
- Is she all right?

91
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,923
- Bill?
- I didn't see Ivy at school this morning.

92
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,010
Is she all right?

93
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,189
- 89, 90. Ten. Thank you.
- Thank you.

94
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:35,442
- You've gotta give me another ten.
- What do you mean?

95
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,903
- You gave me a $10 bill.
- I gave you $20.

96
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:44,951
- You just gave me a ten. Look.
- Mister, I only had a $20 bill in my wallet.

97
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:50,415
You probably misread the bill.
Can you see the register?

98
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,626
Hey. What's the matter with you?

99
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,813
It's so beautiful.

100
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:17,067
It's fantastic. I love it.

101
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:20,070
- Thank you.
- Hey. What?

102
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:25,700
What's so fantastic? Well, now.

103
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:30,330
- Where did you find this?
- On top of the worktops, where you put it.

104
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,169
- What's going on?
- Daddy bought me a purse.

105
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:39,214
I found the package in the groceries
with my name on it.

106
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,634
- Oh, it's gorgeous, Bill.
- Yeah.

107
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,012
It's the first grown-up present
I've ever gotten.

108
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:51,101
And the colours are just like
the paintings in the ceiling. I love it.

109
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,941
- You didn't buy the purse.
- No.

110
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,655
He did. That man.

111
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:13,456
- How long have you known about him?
- Oh, my God, Bill. It's Ivy he's after.

112
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:19,796
- Why do you say that?
- Well, the way he looks at her.

113
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:24,759
And this morning he called just to see
how she was. And now the purse.

114
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:28,096
Oh, Bill, please, let's call the police.

115
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,265
I went to them already.

116
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,813
Honey, there's nothing they can do
unless he draws blood.

117
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:25,487
- Morning.
- Morning, Mrs Templeton.

118
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,821
It's a clipping from Who's Who.

119
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:13,201
Hoover, Elliot Suggens.

- Published numerous articles.
- Take it to the police.

125
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,932
It's not enough.

126
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:40,562
All it is is a couple of facts about his life.
We can't even that prove he sent it.

127
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:44,232
- Then what are we going to do?
- I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

128
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:47,861
Next time I see him, I'll grab him
and find out what it's all about.

129
00:18:47,986 --> 00:18:51,406
- Be very careful.
- Honey, you be careful.

130
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,200
If he bothers you at school today,
just call a cop.

131
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:57,370
OK.

132
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:00,278
Right, take it easy
or I'll run you both in.

133
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:15,555
The ambulance will be here soon, ma'am.
You'll be all right. I've got your bag.

134
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,768
Come on, keep moving.
Give her some air. Come on.

135
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:25,690
Oh, my God, Ivy! What time is it?

136
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:28,234
- 3.20.
- I have to go.

137
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:33,489
- Take it easy.
- I have to go. I have to get my daughter.

138
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,518
Ivy!

139
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:47,313
Ivy!

140
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:52,402
Ivy!

141
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,322
Ivy!

142
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,826
Ivy!

143
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:13,589
Ivy is at home, Mrs Templeton.
I helped her across the street.

144
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:17,093
She's waiting in the lobby for you.

145
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:21,139
Here, you dropped your purse
on the sidewalk.

146
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:26,018
We must talk. I'm certain now. Please.

147
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:32,400
Who are you? What do you want?

148
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:37,530
Tell your husband
I'll phone him this evening. Please.

149
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:56,716
You wait right there, young lady.

150
00:21:56,841 --> 00:22:01,429
You are never, never, to leave school
without me. Do you understand me?

151
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:05,057
Under no circumstances
are you to go away with strangers.

152
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:10,104
You sit in that school office, and if you
have to, you just wait and wait and wait.

153
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:15,610
- Do you understand me, Ivy?
- Mommy, you're hurting me.

154
00:22:21,956 --> 00:22:23,826
I'm sorry.

155
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,537
- Mr Templeton?
- What is it you want?

156
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:12,708
- Why are you bothering us?
- My name is Elliot Hoover.

157
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:17,296
Now, look, I must see you and your wife.
It's very important.

158
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:23,594
Um... We could meet around the corner
at Severino's Restaurant. It's quiet there.

159
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:27,139
That's impossible.
We can't leave our child alone.

160
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:32,603
Well, Carole Rothman might be willing
to sit with Ivy for an hour or so, surely?

161
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:35,731
- Mr Templeton?
- I'll see.

162
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:39,777
Let's say 9.30.
If that's convenient, of course.

163
00:23:39,902 --> 00:23:41,946
I'll see.

164
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,325
Call the police.

165
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,995
Not until I find out
what the hell this is all about, babe.

166
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:12,810
Mr Templeton!

167
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:17,606
Mrs Templeton.

168
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:24,947
It's very quiet in here.
I... I've reserved a table.

169
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:49,346
Look, I want to thank you both
very much for seeing me.

170
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:50,806
Good evening.

171
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:53,100
Would you like something, Mrs Templeton?

172
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,811
- Well, not for me, thank you.
- Scotch, Maria.

173
00:24:55,936 --> 00:25:00,482
Ah, yes, I'll have tea.
Do you have any Chinese gunpowder?

174
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:03,068
I'll see if we have some.

175
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,495
For two weeks a man with a beard has
been bugging my family. Is that man you?

176
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:15,873
Yes.

177
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,750
I apologise for that.

178
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:22,922
But all the subterfuge, the disguise,
were absolutely necessary

179
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,341
before this meeting could take place.

180
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:28,594
- I had to be sure.
- Of what?

181
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:34,516
Well, things had to be right
before we met.

182
00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:37,436
Let me explain.

183
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:42,232
It's taken me a very long time,
seven years, in fact,

184
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:45,444
seven years of travel,
investigation and study,

185
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:48,614
calling for a total reconditioning
of all my spiritual...

186
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:51,742
What the hell are you talking about?

187
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:57,414
I'll try and make things
as clear as I'm able to, Mr Templeton.

188
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:03,003
But first there are some things that you
must know. Some very complex things.

189
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:08,509
So I'll begin at the beginning.

190
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:15,265
11 years ago, I was a very happy man.

191
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,270
I had a family.

192
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:22,648
A wonderful wife

193
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:24,692
and a lovely daughter.

194
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:30,072
My daughter's name was Audrey Rose.

195
00:26:31,031 --> 00:26:33,117
She was five when she died.

196
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:37,371
Everything that was good seemed
to shine from her eyes, you know?

197
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:42,334
Anyway, there was
an automobile accident and...

198
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:45,504
It happened just outside Pittsburgh.

199
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:50,217
There was a storm
and their car just went off the road.

200
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,138
It was very quick, very sudden.

201
00:26:54,263 --> 00:26:56,306
Thank you.

202
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,563
Naturally, the loss of my wife and
my daughter was quite unbearable.

203
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:08,193
I don't know how I existed. One day I had
a feeling that Audrey Rose was near me.

204
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:13,907
We didn't have any Chinese gunpowder,
sir, so I brought you Formosa oolong.

205
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,827
Thank you, Maria.

206
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:21,039
I still don't understand what you're saying
and why you're saying it to us.

207
00:27:21,165 --> 00:27:23,208
All right.

208
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:32,301
About a year after the accident,
a friend took me to a dinner party.

209
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,223
One of the guests was a psychic.
A clairvoyant.

210
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:43,979
She told me everything I had done
since I was a boy,

211
00:27:44,104 --> 00:27:49,860
and then she began
to talk about my daughter, Audrey Rose,

212
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:53,614
describing her as if she were alive.

213
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:56,825
I asked her to stop, but she wouldn't.

214
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:01,371
I remember I began to cry,

215
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,373
because I couldn't help it,

216
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:07,961
and she leaned over
and she asked me why I was crying.

217
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:12,132
So I told her that my wife
and my daughter were dead.

218
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,718
But she said no.

219
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:20,933
No, my wife was at peace,

220
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:24,436
but my daughter was alive.

221
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:30,776
I thought it was a poor joke. I couldn't
believe that anybody could be that cruel.

222
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:36,490
Then a few months later I happened to be
here in New York City on a business trip.

223
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:39,076
One night I was passing the Town Hall

224
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:42,616
and I saw advertised
on the marquee outside,

225
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:46,497
"Eric Lloyd, clairvoyant."

226
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:51,046
Anyway, after the lecture,
or the demonstration, whatever,

227
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:54,591
I went back and saw Mr Lloyd
in his dressing room

228
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:59,638
and, like the woman at the party,
he told me very accurate things.

229
00:28:59,763 --> 00:29:02,891
Very accurate things indeed.

230
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:08,105
Things about my daughter, Audrey Rose.

231
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:13,527
Again, describing her
as if she were alive,

232
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:19,116
but this time giving me details
of the home she lived in.

233
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:22,327
It was an apartment
here in New York City

234
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:27,958
that had a lovely ceiling
with classic paintings set into it.

235
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:33,964
And even the room in which she slept,
with the yellow and white curtains.

236
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:37,134
The matching canopy bed.

237
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:39,219
The...

238
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,431
The giant panda
and the aquarium in the corner.

239
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:46,059
She had come back, he said.

240
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:48,687
Audrey Rose had come back...

241
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,984
I'm terribly sorry.

242
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,545
I'm sorry, Mrs Templeton,
this must be a shock to you.

243
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,174
I can understand what a blow
your daughter's death must've been,

244
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:19,676
how hard it was for you to accept.

245
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:24,222
But what you're saying now...
Reincarnation, is that what you're saying?

246
00:30:24,347 --> 00:30:26,433
There's no mistake, Mr Templeton.

247
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,810
The very moment I saw Ivy,
I could recognise

248
00:30:28,935 --> 00:30:32,397
all the subtle qualities
that once belonged to Audrey Rose.

249
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:37,152
Mr Hoover, you can believe what you
want, but please don't involve my family.

250
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:41,823
- You're wanted on the phone.
- Excuse me.

251
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:48,079
- Mrs Templeton, can we talk?
- No, excuse me. I have to go see...

252
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:50,373
All right, we'll be right up.

253
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:52,000
- What is it?
- Ivy.

254
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:54,252
- Ivy? What's the matter?
- I don't know.

255
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:58,173
- Mr Templeton, we haven't finished.
- Yes, Mr Hoover, we have finished.

256
00:30:58,298 --> 00:31:01,426
We have listened to your story.
We're very sorry for you.

257
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:04,346
But leave us alone.
Don't follow us. Don't phone us.

258
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:07,224
Your problem is not our problem.

259
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:23,907
Sweetie. Ivy.

260
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:30,455
- Sweetie.
- Daddy... Daddy...

261
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,292
Daddy... Daddy... Daddy...

262
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:38,046
Shh. Wake up, honey.

263
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:41,508
Shh. Hi.

264
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,677
Hi, sweetheart.

265
00:31:45,428 --> 00:31:47,722
- Hi.
- Hi.

266
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,727
Hi, Daddy. What are you doing here?

267
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:56,147
I just came
to kiss my princess good night.

268
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,490
- I'm glad you're here.
- I'll always be here, darling.

269
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:13,289
It's all right. Do call.
I'll be home all morning.

270
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:16,167
OK. Good night.

271
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:32,142
Oh, Bill,
those nightmares twice in one week.

272
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:34,561
Honey, come on. Don't panic, babe.

273
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,939
You know the pattern.
They come and they go.

274
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:42,027
Take her to see Dr Kaplan tomorrow, huh?

275
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:44,404
OK.

276
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:48,408
- What about Elliot Hoover?
- Oh, honey, he's a fanatic, a weirdo.

277
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,410
The city's full of 'em.

278
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:54,330
- What if he isn't?
- You believe his story?

279
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:58,251
Well, he believes it. He sincerely believes
everything he's saying.

280
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:02,797
I know it's crazy, but there's something
about the way he looked.

281
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:08,386
- Heavens.
- Don't worry.

282
00:33:13,183 --> 00:33:16,895
- Hello?
- Mr Templeton? It's Elliot Hoover.

283
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,980
Hoover, I've had enough of you.

284
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:22,442
Leave us alone or I'll take steps
to see that you do. Understand?

285
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:34,662
I don't know if he's an extortionist,

286
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,208
or a nut, as you say,
or a man who believes this to be so.

287
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:42,837
We're talking about an area that a lot
of people don't know anything about.

288
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:46,341
When I was a boy,
every Shabbos we used to sit around

289
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:49,803
and listen to my grandfather
tell stories about the dybbuk,

290
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,514
an evil spirit
who could come and invade bodies.

291
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,893
- What's that got to do with this?
- That every religion has its mysteries.

292
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:59,979
- Come on, Russ.
- OK, scoff.

293
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:05,151
But on Friday nights, when the candles
were lit and he spoke of the dybbuk,

294
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,362
he scared the hell out of us.

295
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:14,744
Question. Did this Hoover
make any demands upon you?

296
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:17,080
No, but there's no saying he won't.

297
00:34:17,205 --> 00:34:20,166
Russ, we are being primed
for some kind of a shakedown.

298
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,795
- Is it possible to contact him?
- It's impossible to avoid him!

299
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,757
- He's been calling the office all morning.
- Good. Invite him to your home.

300
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:30,885
Are you crazy?
I won't let that lunatic into my house.

301
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,138
I'm your lawyer.
I need to know what he's after.

302
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:37,100
Extortion. Blackmail. Ivy.

303
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:41,062
You sit him down and drag this out
very specifically from him.

304
00:34:41,187 --> 00:34:45,066
I'll write out the questions,
you memorise them and ask them.

305
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:48,611
Bill, I'll be there.
I'll be your witness.

306
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:05,753
It's incredible.
It's absolutely incredible.

307
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,634
You know, it's exactly
as Eric Lloyd described it.

308
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:13,803
Ceiling paintings.

309
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,556
Oh, my...

310
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,142
The huge windows.

311
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:25,690
And the carved fireplace.
It's unbelievable.

312
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:31,112
- Would you have a seat, Mr Hoover?
- Certainly.

313
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:37,869
A couple of psychics told you
your daughter had come back to life.

314
00:35:37,994 --> 00:35:41,289
- Is that right?
- Yes, that is correct.

315
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:44,042
Do you know the whereabouts
of these psychics?

316
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:47,795
No. You see,
I never did know the woman's name,

317
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,508
and Eric Lloyd died three years ago.

318
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:57,388
Too bad. So there's nobody around who
could remember having said this to you?

319
00:35:57,513 --> 00:35:59,640
No.

320
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:02,852
Well,
why didn't you contact us back then?

321
00:36:04,103 --> 00:36:07,857
Well, at the time, Mr Templeton,
to be quite honest,

322
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:12,570
I was a scoffer and a disbeliever.
As you are now.

323
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:16,199
I must admit, it took me many years
of seeking and searching

324
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,826
in order to be convinced of the truth.

325
00:36:18,951 --> 00:36:21,245
You see, Mrs Templeton, I went to India,

326
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:26,375
where I learned of a way of life
that was totally alien to mine.

327
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:30,338
But in time, with the help
and the wisdom of simple people,

328
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:33,841
I came to know the reality
of their religious convictions

329
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:37,804
and to know the truth of reincarnation.

330
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,265
There are over 12 million people
in this city.

331
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,769
How did we become
the beneficiaries of your search?

332
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:48,147
Well, now,
that was a process of elimination.

333
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:52,151
According to Eric Lloyd, she lived
somewhere in New York City

334
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:55,822
in a lovely apartment
exactly like this one.

335
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:59,700
Her age would now be 11.

336
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:04,372
Let me put it this way,
Mr and Mrs Templeton.

337
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:10,044
Audrey Rose died October 3rd, 1965.

338
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,216
- That's Ivy's birthday.
- Yeah...

339
00:37:15,341 --> 00:37:20,972
Audrey Rose died
at approximately 8.20 in the morning.

340
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:24,600
Ivy was born at 8.22.

341
00:37:29,564 --> 00:37:32,024
So... just like that, huh?

342
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:37,280
Dead one minute, back to life the next.
Don't you think that's a little unusual?

343
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:40,366
No, not really.

344
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,744
You see,
there are many of schools of thought

345
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:49,292
as to the precise moment that the soul
unites with the body, Mr Templeton.

346
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,961
In Tibet, for example,
it is generally believed

347
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:57,091
that the Dalai Lama is reincarnated
at the very instant of his death.

348
00:37:57,216 --> 00:37:58,926
What is it you want?

349
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:03,222
Nothing more nor less than you and
your good wife are prepared to give me.

350
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,933
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

351
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:09,854
Well, I'd just like the chance
to see Ivy occasionally,

352
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:13,941
to watch her grow,
to be of help if needed.

353
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:17,320
She would never have to know
about Audrey Rose.

354
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:35,796
Oh, my God.

355
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:38,632
Don't shock her.
Remember what the doctor said.

356
00:38:38,758 --> 00:38:41,344
- Ivy!
- Oh, my God!

357
00:38:51,187 --> 00:38:54,065
Bill, she can't seem to hear us.

358
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,318
Ivy, baby, it's Mommy and Daddy.
Honey, wake up.

359
00:39:03,449 --> 00:39:08,579
Ivy... Sweetheart. Ivy! Ivy!

360
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:13,793
Ivy... Oh, Bill, be careful.

361
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,753
Ivy... Oh, my God.

362
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:19,131
Baby. Bill, be careful with her.

363
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,384
Oh, my God.

364
00:39:25,554 --> 00:39:28,516
- Be careful, Bill.
- Ivy!

365
00:39:28,641 --> 00:39:30,684
Ivy, it's Daddy. Wake up.

366
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:33,479
Audrey Rose!

367
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:42,029
Audrey... Audrey Rose...

368
00:39:43,656 --> 00:39:45,908
Audrey...

369
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,461
Audrey... Audrey Rose...

370
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:01,757
Audrey! Audrey! Audrey Rose!
Audrey Rose...

371
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:05,386
Audrey, Audrey...
Audrey, it's me, it's Daddy.

372
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:11,642
Audrey... Audrey Rose... Audrey,
it's me, it's Daddy. It's Daddy, it's me.

373
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:16,647
It's Daddy here. It's Daddy, Audrey.
Audrey, it's Daddy, it's me.

374
00:40:16,772 --> 00:40:20,276
It's Dada. Dada. Come on, darling.

375
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:22,736
Come on, it's me.

376
00:40:22,862 --> 00:40:25,364
- Daddy?
- It's Daddy.

377
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,826
It's Daddy. Yes, it's Daddy. Come on.

378
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:31,620
Yes, come on, come on, it's all right.

379
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:35,165
It's Dada. Daddy. Come on, it's Daddy.

380
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,751
It's all right. It's Daddy. Come on.

381
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:41,255
Come on, come on, it's Daddy, it's Dada.

382
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,966
- Yes, come on. Come on, darling.
- Daddy?

383
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:46,552
It's gonna be all right. Yeah, it's me.

384
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,346
It's Daddy. It's Dada. It's all right.

385
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,858
Audrey...

386
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:03,027
Audrey Rose...

387
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:15,664
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Templeton,
Mrs Templeton...

388
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,003
You see...

389
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:24,840
Sorry. You see, it was the accident.

390
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:29,094
There was a fire.
The car windows were closed.

391
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:34,016
The car windows were closed
and she couldn't get out.

392
00:41:35,976 --> 00:41:42,691
She couldn't get out of the car
and I'm told it lasted for several minutes.

393
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:48,322
Forgive me.

394
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:52,117
The windows were closed. She couldn't...

395
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:54,286
Sorry.

396
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:03,128
My God.
I had no idea this was happening.

397
00:42:05,214 --> 00:42:08,008
- I think she'll be all right now.
- You bastard!

398
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:10,886
- Bill, enough!
- Damn you, Hoover! Damn you!

399
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:12,971
You better get out of here.

400
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,682
Damn you, Hoover!

401
00:42:15,808 --> 00:42:20,938
- Get going.
- I'm sorry. Please. I'll go.

402
00:42:21,063 --> 00:42:24,441
I'll go. I'll go.

403
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:26,401
My God.

404
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,491
Bill.

405
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:35,369
- Bill.
- Honey.

406
00:42:37,663 --> 00:42:39,706
Oh, honey.

407
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:47,256
It was the radiator. She burned them
on the radiator, honey. Call Dr Kaplan.

408
00:42:47,381 --> 00:42:49,424
Right.

409
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,598
- Dad... Daddy?
- Yes, princess, Daddy's here.

410
00:42:56,723 --> 00:42:58,767
Daddy's here.

411
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:25,294
- Get some sleep.
- He's crazy. He's crazy, isn't he?

412
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:30,465
Just relax. I'll go to court tomorrow and
get an injunction. We'll put a stop to this.

413
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,759
Russ, thanks.

414
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:51,695
What is going on?
What's happening to Ivy?

415
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:55,115
She had a nightmare, honey.
She's had them before.

416
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,703
Yes, and always around her birthday.
Two years ago they happened in October.

417
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:03,040
When she was six,
they happened at exactly the same time.

418
00:44:03,165 --> 00:44:04,916
Janice, please.

419
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,336
- How did she burn her hands?
- On the radiator.

420
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:09,963
The radiator was
nowhere near the window.

421
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:14,968
What are you building? The room
was dark. It was confusing and chaotic.

422
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:18,263
I saw her burn her hands
on a cold window.

423
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:20,932
You think you saw that.
You only think you saw that.

424
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:24,811
Russ saw it too.
I could tell by the look on his face.

425
00:44:24,936 --> 00:44:27,356
Honey, it didn't happen.

426
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:31,818
Bill, she burned her hands
on a cold window.

427
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:34,988
Janice.

428
00:44:35,113 --> 00:44:38,283
Honey, please listen to me.

429
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:46,667
What you're building here is not for me.
I can't accept it. I don't believe it.

430
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,921
When I die, it's gonna be the end of me.

431
00:44:51,046 --> 00:44:53,840
- No.
- No wings, no harps, no pitchforks.

432
00:44:53,965 --> 00:44:57,260
Nothing.
It's done, it's the end, it's finished.

433
00:44:57,386 --> 00:44:59,554
No floating around some maternity ward

434
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:02,808
waiting to sneak into the body
of some unsuspecting infant.

435
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,185
He'd resent it
and I'd feel very horrified.

436
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,271
Don't laugh, Janice. I'm not kidding.

437
00:45:35,507 --> 00:45:38,051
- Janice?
- Oh, Bill.

438
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:41,847
Look, darling, I'm gonna be delayed here.
I'm locked up with a client.

439
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,224
Will you be home for dinner?

440
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:48,186
No, it's the full treatment.
It could be late.

441
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:50,480
- How's Ivy?
- OK.

442
00:45:50,605 --> 00:45:54,234
Dr Kaplan just left.
He redressed her hands.

443
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:55,777
Did he say anything?

444
00:45:55,902 --> 00:45:59,614
He thinks we should
take her to a psychiatrist.

445
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:03,285
OK. Any calls?

446
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,412
No.

447
00:46:05,537 --> 00:46:10,167
Good. Look, I'll be home as soon as I can
break away from this thing, all right?

448
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:13,003
- OK.
- OK, bye.

449
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,216
Bye.

450
00:46:47,913 --> 00:46:50,040
What's that for?

451
00:46:50,165 --> 00:46:54,878
There's a draught coming through
the panes. Ow! Damn screen.

452
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:58,131
Watch your language, Mother.
There are children present.

453
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:04,888
- That's the house phone.
- Thank you very much!

454
00:47:10,685 --> 00:47:12,187
Hello?

455
00:47:12,312 --> 00:47:16,316
There's a Mr Hoover on the line,
Mrs Templeton.

456
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:21,905
- Tell him I'm not at home.
- Yes, ma'am.

457
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:35,770
- Dr Kaplan's service.
- Yes, Dr Kaplan, please.

458
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:39,482
- Name?
- This is Mrs Templeton. Where is he?

459
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,408
Oh... Oh...

460
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:40,585
- Dr Kaplan?
- Mrs Templeton.

461
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,880
There's a Mr Hoover
down here in the lobby.

462
00:49:44,005 --> 00:49:47,300
- Send him up.
- Daddy! Daddy!

463
00:49:49,677 --> 00:49:52,222
Daddy! Daddy!

464
00:49:54,974 --> 00:49:58,311
- Hurry, please.
- Daddy!

465
00:49:58,436 --> 00:50:00,605
Daddy! Daddy!

466
00:50:02,315 --> 00:50:04,192
Daddy... Daddy!

467
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:07,362
Audrey Rose. Audrey Rose.

468
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,155
Audrey Rose.

469
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,741
Audrey... Audrey... Audrey Rose.

470
00:50:11,866 --> 00:50:15,078
- Daddy...
- Audrey... Audrey...

471
00:50:17,038 --> 00:50:19,958
It's Daddy. It's Daddy.

472
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,543
It's Daddy.

473
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,132
Audrey, it's Daddy. It's Daddy.

474
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:32,887
It's Daddy. Come on, it's Daddy.
It's Daddy. Dada. Yeah.

475
00:50:33,012 --> 00:50:36,557
It's Daddy. It's your daddy.
It's Dada. Dada.

476
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:39,477
- Daddy?
- Yes, come on.

477
00:50:39,602 --> 00:50:43,773
Audrey, yeah, it's Daddy.
Come on. Come on.

478
00:50:45,274 --> 00:50:47,068
All right. All right.

479
00:50:47,985 --> 00:50:51,239
Shh. It's OK, it's all right. Yes.

480
00:50:51,364 --> 00:50:53,408
It's all right.

481
00:50:56,494 --> 00:50:59,038
It's all right. It's Daddy.

482
00:51:00,456 --> 00:51:02,250
Yes, it's all right.

483
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:10,758
Daddy...

484
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:39,662
Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee

485
00:51:39,787 --> 00:51:44,584
and I detest all my sins because I dread
the loss of heaven and the pains of hell,

486
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:47,295
but most of all
because they offend thee, my God,

487
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,465
who art all good
and deserving of all my love.

488
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:54,218
I firmly resolve now,
with the help of thy grace,

489
00:51:54,343 --> 00:52:00,808
to confess my sins, to do penance,
and to amend my life. Amen.

490
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:04,437
Mea culpa. Mea culpa.

491
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:06,731
Mea maxima culpa.

492
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:42,350
Mrs Templeton.

493
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,275
It's all right.

494
00:52:55,446 --> 00:52:59,659
Why don't you sit down?
Sit down. Try and relax.

495
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:17,260
This might sting a little.

496
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:24,225
Mrs Templeton.

497
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,645
Please try and understand,

498
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:33,150
and believe me, I know you don't take
the responsibilities of your child lightly,

499
00:53:33,275 --> 00:53:35,987
but we are dealing here
with something else,

500
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:40,825
something greater than your daughter's
physical being or physical welfare.

501
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,828
We're dealing with a soul
that is indestructible

502
00:53:43,953 --> 00:53:48,082
and yet it is struggling to get free
because it is in terrible pain and torment,

503
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:52,003
a pain and torment as real and tangible
as the actual physical terror

504
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,588
experienced by Audrey Rose

505
00:53:54,714 --> 00:53:59,802
at the moment her body was consumed
by that terrible fire of 11 years ago.

506
00:53:59,927 --> 00:54:02,555
It's... just... a... nightmare.

507
00:54:08,185 --> 00:54:10,646
Come on, Mrs Templeton, please.

508
00:54:15,609 --> 00:54:22,199
Listen, your daughter is in mortal danger.
Do you know that?

509
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,620
She could possibly die
if you don't listen to what I'm telling you.

510
00:54:26,746 --> 00:54:28,581
Now, try to understand.

511
00:54:28,706 --> 00:54:35,171
As long as a soul is unprepared to accept
the laws and responsibilities of its karma,

512
00:54:35,296 --> 00:54:40,134
it cannot exist in this earth life, it cannot
exist on this earth plane. It has to go back.

513
00:54:40,259 --> 00:54:43,763
I don't understand a word
you are saying.

514
00:54:44,472 --> 00:54:46,807
It's quite simple, Mrs Templeton.

515
00:54:46,932 --> 00:54:49,560
My daughter's soul returned too soon.

516
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:53,939
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, your daughter?

517
00:54:54,064 --> 00:54:57,318
Her soul? This is my daughter
we're talking about, my child.

518
00:54:57,443 --> 00:55:00,988
- It's all right, you don't understand.
- I don't want to understand.

519
00:55:01,113 --> 00:55:03,866
Why, you... You are crazy. You're nuts.

520
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:06,911
My husband said so
and I want you out of here.

521
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:09,830
- It's just your fear talking.
- No, it is me talking.

522
00:55:09,955 --> 00:55:13,167
I am telling you that my daughter
is not possessed.

523
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:16,212
I'm not talking about possession,
but reincarnation.

524
00:55:16,337 --> 00:55:20,466
- Please listen to me. Come here.
- No! No!

525
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:25,387
I'm not gonna hurt you. Look at me.

526
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,391
What is it you really fear, eh?

527
00:55:32,811 --> 00:55:37,608
Listen to me. Two people, two strangers,
came into my life and changed it.

528
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:39,944
Eric Lloyd was one of them.

529
00:55:40,611 --> 00:55:44,990
He told me a story that was so incredible
it took complete hold of me

530
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:48,536
and made my heart search
for the very truth of existence itself.

531
00:55:48,661 --> 00:55:50,871
All right, I know, it sounds bizarre.

532
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:56,543
But I went to India, where I found
a way of life that was indescribable.

533
00:55:56,669 --> 00:56:01,131
I found brutalising poverty,
starvation, death, pestilence.

534
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,051
But I also found something else.

535
00:56:04,176 --> 00:56:06,720
With all the misery
that those people had to face,

536
00:56:06,845 --> 00:56:10,140
there was still a great spiritual peace
and joy in their lives

537
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:16,021
because they believe...
they believe that this life is not the end.

538
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:18,941
Life and death are not the end.

539
00:56:19,066 --> 00:56:21,735
And I believe that now
without a shadow of doubt.

540
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,072
This life, the end? No.

541
00:56:25,197 --> 00:56:29,410
This is one act
in a vast cosmic drama, that's all.

542
00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:35,416
Oh, yes, our bodies die,
our aged vessels crack,

543
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:40,045
releasing the ensnared soul yet again
on its vast journey homewards,

544
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:45,592
through many lifetimes, many lifetimes,
improving with each new life.

545
00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:50,806
Not only do I believe this beyond
a shadow of doubt, Mrs Templeton,

546
00:56:50,931 --> 00:56:55,853
but 700 million other people
also believe it.

547
00:56:58,522 --> 00:57:00,566
Please.

548
00:57:01,483 --> 00:57:05,779
Please, won't you open your heart and try
to understand what I'm telling you?

549
00:57:05,904 --> 00:57:08,615
Please. Please say you will try.

550
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:10,784
Please.

551
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:14,204
What is it you want from me?

552
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:17,166
I want your trust and your help.
That's all I want.

553
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:19,793
The soul of a child
is crying out for help

554
00:57:19,918 --> 00:57:24,840
and we must form a bond, a bond so tight,
so filled with all the love that you have,

555
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:28,135
all the love that I have,
that we can mend her.

556
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,637
Mend her soul?

557
00:57:30,763 --> 00:57:33,348
Yes. Yes. Yes.

558
00:57:33,474 --> 00:57:36,059
Together we can try.

559
00:57:36,185 --> 00:57:41,231
I... I just want to be close to her, to pray
for her, to do good for her, that's all I want.

560
00:57:41,356 --> 00:57:44,318
You see, Audrey Rose
was only five when she died.

561
00:57:44,443 --> 00:57:46,028
In her brief time on earth,

562
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:49,865
she was just coming to an awareness
of the spiritual beauties of life.

563
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:52,868
I believe if God is willing...
only if God is willing...

564
00:57:52,993 --> 00:57:57,706
that we can bring her soul
back to that awareness.

565
00:57:57,831 --> 00:58:00,584
But I need your help in this.

566
00:58:03,545 --> 00:58:05,798
Look.

567
00:58:05,923 --> 00:58:09,259
We are both a part of this child,
Mrs Templeton.

568
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:12,513
We both had to do
with the making of her.

569
00:58:12,638 --> 00:58:15,098
You and I.

570
00:58:16,725 --> 00:58:19,019
Now, don't turn your back on me now.

571
00:58:19,144 --> 00:58:23,273
Because if you do,
you turn your back on Ivy.

572
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,376
Hello?

573
00:58:42,501 --> 00:58:46,547
This is Dr Kaplan, Janice.
You called me?

574
00:58:46,672 --> 00:58:49,091
Oh, yes, Dr Kaplan, I did.

575
00:58:49,216 --> 00:58:53,178
- What seems to be the matter?
- No, no, nothing is the matter.

576
00:58:56,515 --> 00:58:58,642
I'll call you in the morning.

577
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:01,061
- I'll be at home if you should need me.
- Yes.

578
00:59:01,186 --> 00:59:03,063
- OK?
- Fine.

579
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:06,149
- Good night.
- Goodbye.

580
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,242
Try and get some sleep.

581
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:17,786
We'll talk again tomorrow.

582
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:23,625
Good night.

583
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,122
Thank you.

584
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:48,668
You let him in, Janice.
You let him in. Why?

585
01:00:48,794 --> 01:00:51,671
- Ivy went crazy, Bill. I needed help.
- Help?

586
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:55,592
Why didn't you call the office
and find out where I'd taken the client?

587
01:00:55,717 --> 01:00:59,805
Or call the elevator man or Russ. Why
did you let somebody like that in here?

588
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:05,644
Bill, Ivy went crazy. She was
hurting herself and he was there.

589
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:07,729
What are you talking about? He's a nut.

590
01:01:07,854 --> 01:01:11,775
He was in the building,
and he helped her before.

591
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:16,404
A nut, that's what he is. He's some kind
of a magician. He's got you hypnotised.

592
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,365
He's taken you in. You let him.

593
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:22,869
Sure I let him. You saw the living room...
the furniture overturned, the curtain torn.

594
01:01:22,994 --> 01:01:26,665
What do you think did that, a cyclone?
Our daughter did that. Ivy.

595
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:31,419
She was out of control, she was crazy,
hurting herself, and I couldn't stop her.

596
01:01:31,545 --> 01:01:35,590
You're crazy.
He's gotten you crazy, Janice.

597
01:01:35,715 --> 01:01:39,845
That's right, yes.
He also scares me and he panics me.

598
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:44,683
But he comes in here and he calls her
that name and she hears him.

599
01:01:44,808 --> 01:01:49,646
She listens and goes to him,
and just falls asleep in his arms.

600
01:01:49,771 --> 01:01:52,566
- Bullshit!
- Don't you ever say that to me.

601
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:56,653
Don't ever speak to me that way again.
Where were you when I needed you?

602
01:01:56,778 --> 01:01:59,531
Out drinking with some goddamn client.

603
01:01:59,656 --> 01:02:03,451
- Stop it, Janice.
- Don't you... Don't you touch me.

604
01:02:04,703 --> 01:02:08,373
Stay away from me. You saw her hands.
Why did that happen, Bill?

605
01:02:08,498 --> 01:02:10,750
Why does she scream and cry and yell?

606
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:15,255
Do you think what's happening
to her is normal, for God's sake?

607
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,758
No, it's not normal. Honey, she is sick.

608
01:02:21,845 --> 01:02:26,391
- Baby, we're gonna get help for her.
- He was here. He took care of her.

609
01:02:26,516 --> 01:02:28,935
We'll take her to see the psychiatrist.

610
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:33,023
- We'll find out what's wrong with her.
- He was here and you weren't.

611
01:02:33,148 --> 01:02:36,651
Oh, baby, honey, I'll be here,
from now on I'll be here.

612
01:02:36,776 --> 01:02:40,447
Look, I'll take time off,
whatever time is necessary.

613
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:44,993
Baby, I'll be with you and Ivy. Honey,
I'll be with both of you. I love you.

614
01:02:45,118 --> 01:02:48,413
I love my family very much, honey.

615
01:03:09,267 --> 01:03:12,020
- Here, let's try one more.
- OK.

616
01:03:12,145 --> 01:03:13,813
Mom.

617
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:15,982
Look, no hands.

618
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:24,574
If I burned them on the radiator
going to the bathroom,

619
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:26,534
how come I didn't wake up?

620
01:03:26,659 --> 01:03:31,372
Because we put ointment on them
very quickly and burns only hurt later on.

621
01:03:31,498 --> 01:03:34,959
Oh, yeah, like the time I got sunburnt
on the beach last summer.

622
01:03:35,085 --> 01:03:37,128
It took hours to hurt.

623
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:43,802
My birthday's tomorrow.
Did you pick something nice for me?

624
01:03:43,927 --> 01:03:48,139
Yep, it's all picked, wrapped,
ribboned and waiting to be opened.

625
01:03:48,264 --> 01:03:51,226
- How about a pizza and going home?
- With cream soda?

626
01:03:51,351 --> 01:03:53,853
- The works.
- Mom, let's go home.

627
01:03:53,978 --> 01:03:59,442
Come on, Mom, I'm hungry.
Let's go home. We're gonna buy a pizza.

628
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,612
Ivy!

629
01:04:02,737 --> 01:04:05,281
Damn it. Ivy! Ivy!

630
01:04:05,406 --> 01:04:07,909
Janice, help me. Ivy!

631
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:13,123
It's Kaplan, honey.
Stay with her. Stay with her.

632
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:15,291
Ivy. Ivy.

633
01:04:25,802 --> 01:04:28,888
- Ah, Mr Templeton.
- How the hell did you get up here?

634
01:04:29,013 --> 01:04:31,891
Please let me explain.
Please, Mr Templeton!

635
01:04:38,898 --> 01:04:40,984
Come on. Please. I'm sorry.

636
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:45,238
- I'll kill you, you son of a...
- Please. Please.

637
01:04:47,073 --> 01:04:49,117
Please, Mr...

638
01:04:59,127 --> 01:05:01,170
Hurry, call the police.

639
01:05:05,717 --> 01:05:08,219
Stop it! Stop it!

640
01:05:08,344 --> 01:05:11,222
Audrey Rose! Audrey, I'm coming.

641
01:05:11,347 --> 01:05:13,474
Bill!

642
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,561
Oh, my God. Bill, the door. The door.

643
01:05:16,686 --> 01:05:18,896
Get a cop.
The son of a bitch has got my kid.

644
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:21,065
They're on the way.

645
01:05:23,234 --> 01:05:26,738
- Open the door, you son of a bitch.
- Bill!

646
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:32,035
Will somebody ring for the elevator
and get a pass key?

647
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,621
The guy's a kook, he's a psycho.
Will you hurry?

648
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:37,415
Bill. Bill, it's all right.
He won't hurt her.

649
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,544
Will you keep out of this?
I've had enough of this bullshit. Hoover!

650
01:05:43,463 --> 01:05:46,215
Dominick,
bring me the pass key, come on.

651
01:05:46,341 --> 01:05:48,718
Open up. Hurry.

652
01:05:54,974 --> 01:05:56,267
Hoover!

653
01:05:57,935 --> 01:05:59,270
Hoover!

654
01:06:00,646 --> 01:06:03,649
- Hoover!
- What's the trouble?

655
01:06:03,775 --> 01:06:07,737
A man is in my house with my child.
He assaulted me and he's locked us out.

656
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:10,990
- Do you know this man?
- His name is Elliot Hoover.

657
01:06:11,115 --> 01:06:14,577
Wait, wait, wait,
the service entrance. Of course.

658
01:06:17,163 --> 01:06:19,832
My God, he's taken her. Hoover!

659
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:22,668
- Stand back here.
- Hoover!

660
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:27,048
Ivy!

661
01:06:27,173 --> 01:06:30,301
Hoover!

662
01:06:30,426 --> 01:06:32,970
Ivy!

663
01:06:34,722 --> 01:06:36,766
They're gone.

664
01:06:37,934 --> 01:06:39,894
He's kidnapped Ivy.

665
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:44,524
Just today, Mr Hoover sublet a suite
on the eighth floor. Number 802.

666
01:06:44,649 --> 01:06:46,692
This way. Come on.

667
01:06:54,992 --> 01:06:56,410
Hoover!

668
01:06:56,536 --> 01:06:58,996
We'll handle this, sir.

669
01:07:01,165 --> 01:07:05,378
Mr Hoover, I'm a police officer.
Open the door.

670
01:07:08,464 --> 01:07:11,592
Mr Hoover, I will ask you
once again to open the door.

671
01:07:11,717 --> 01:07:13,678
- No.
- Open the door, you bastard.

672
01:07:13,803 --> 01:07:15,847
That will do, sir.

673
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:29,485
Mr Hoover, please open the door.

674
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:32,280
No. There has been
enough insanity for one night.

675
01:07:32,405 --> 01:07:35,616
Is there a child on your premises?

676
01:07:37,118 --> 01:07:39,996
Yes. She's sleeping peacefully.

677
01:07:41,163 --> 01:07:43,833
Does this child belong to this person?

678
01:07:46,836 --> 01:07:49,130
- No, she's mine.
- He has no child.

679
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:51,173
He's a nut. Now break it down.

680
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:54,552
Mr Hoover, I will give you
30 seconds to open the door.

681
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:17,283
Daddy...

682
01:08:20,453 --> 01:08:25,541
My name is Michael Noonan. Police
officer first class, badge number 1433.

683
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:28,753
You're under arrest on suspicion
of the felony of kidnapping.

684
01:08:28,878 --> 01:08:31,881
You have the right to remain silent,
the right to legal counsel.

685
01:08:32,006 --> 01:08:34,383
If you give up these rights,
anything you say

686
01:08:34,508 --> 01:08:39,263
will be used against you in a court of law.
Do you understand these rights?

687
01:09:01,577 --> 01:09:06,290
There is nothing more I can do than to
ask you to listen to your own heartbeat.

688
01:09:06,415 --> 01:09:11,379
Just feel what you're feeling right now.
Think what you're thinking right now.

689
01:09:11,504 --> 01:09:14,173
You're watching me
trying to convince you of things

690
01:09:14,298 --> 01:09:16,967
that you don't care about,
you don't believe.

691
01:09:17,093 --> 01:09:19,929
But I'm telling you
there are lives at stake right now

692
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:23,057
and I tell you from the bottom
of my heart this child lives.

693
01:09:23,182 --> 01:09:25,393
She lives!

694
01:09:25,518 --> 01:09:27,812
Audrey Rose lives!

695
01:09:29,605 --> 01:09:34,198
Her soul has crossed over

696
01:09:34,323 --> 01:09:38,800
that veil of darkness
into a new earth life

697
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:45,271
and now resides in the body of the child
who is called Ivy Templeton.

698
01:09:45,496 --> 01:09:47,665
And so, four months after his arrest,

699
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:50,126
and after five hard weeks
of jury selection

700
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:53,003
and the presentation
of the prosecution's case,

701
01:09:53,129 --> 01:09:55,923
the defence of Elliot Hoover
finally gets underway.

702
01:09:56,048 --> 01:09:59,051
Among the first witnesses
will be Gupta Pradesh,

703
01:09:59,176 --> 01:10:02,388
the holy man from Benares, India,
the maharishi,

704
01:10:02,513 --> 01:10:05,224
whose task it will be
to convince 12 American jurors

705
01:10:05,349 --> 01:10:07,268
of the truth of reincarnation,

706
01:10:07,393 --> 01:10:10,312
which will form the basis
of the defence's case...

707
01:10:10,438 --> 01:10:13,858
a case unique in the annals
of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence,

708
01:10:13,983 --> 01:10:17,611
a case that has riveted
the attention of the entire world.

709
01:10:17,736 --> 01:10:22,366
Many of you look upon death
as the ending to life,

710
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:28,038
a leap into an eternal nothingness
from which there is no return.

711
01:10:28,164 --> 01:10:33,502
Because of this, you are filled
with dread and despair,

712
01:10:33,627 --> 01:10:37,256
even rage, at the injustice of death.

713
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:41,719
We in India are not afraid of death.

714
01:10:41,844 --> 01:10:46,223
Our bodies,
because they are material, can die,

715
01:10:46,348 --> 01:10:50,519
but the soul, which is spirit,
can never die.

716
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:56,192
That is the difference
between matter and spirit.

717
01:10:56,317 --> 01:11:00,666
In India, our belief in reincarnation

718
01:11:00,816 --> 01:11:03,993
inspires us to love all people.

719
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,661
For in the course
of our numerous rebirths,

720
01:11:07,786 --> 01:11:12,708
we have been parents,
children and friends to one another.

721
01:11:14,335 --> 01:11:18,172
For us, death is not the end to life,

722
01:11:18,297 --> 01:11:24,345
but a momentary separation,
a fragile respite in the astral cosmos,

723
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:26,347
where the soul must wait

724
01:11:26,472 --> 01:11:32,394
and through meditation seek to clothe
itself in the higher spiritual garments

725
01:11:32,519 --> 01:11:36,941
before attempting rebirth
in the next earth life.

726
01:11:37,066 --> 01:11:39,109
Now, please understand me.

727
01:11:39,234 --> 01:11:43,572
When a person dies in my country
and we set flame to the body

728
01:11:43,697 --> 01:11:46,367
and watch as it is consumed,

729
01:11:46,492 --> 01:11:51,622
we do not grieve for the body that is lost,
for the Bhagavad-Gita assures us

730
01:11:51,747 --> 01:11:56,585
that as a man casts off worn-out garments
and takes new ones,

731
01:11:56,710 --> 01:12:02,383
so the soul casts off old bodies
and enters into others that are new,

732
01:12:02,508 --> 01:12:07,346
and so our minds are freed
from the fear of death

733
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:12,476
and we are able to live each earth life
in a spiritually productive manner,

734
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:18,774
for we are certain that the end is good
and all are blessed,

735
01:12:18,899 --> 01:12:23,278
even to the final atom
in the scale of being.

736
01:12:54,935 --> 01:13:01,984
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

737
01:13:02,109 --> 01:13:05,696
Alleluia!

738
01:13:05,821 --> 01:13:07,865
Freak!

739
01:13:10,868 --> 01:13:14,246
We found it on one of the girls
and now it's all over the school.

740
01:13:14,371 --> 01:13:19,168
In spite of everything
we tried to do to shield Ivy, we failed.

741
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:24,715
I'm sorry, Mrs Templeton.
Ivy seems to love it here so.

742
01:13:25,507 --> 01:13:28,760
Her nightmares have lessened
and she's been so happy.

743
01:13:28,886 --> 01:13:30,888
Until this.

744
01:13:32,055 --> 01:13:36,476
Will you speak with Ivy
and explain to her the truth of the matter?

745
01:13:36,602 --> 01:13:39,646
She doesn't understand
and is frightened.

746
01:13:39,771 --> 01:13:43,859
Yes, of course I will. May I keep her
with me overnight at the motel?

747
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:46,028
Certainly.

748
01:13:50,073 --> 01:13:53,827
- Then I am a freak. The girls are right.
- No.

749
01:13:53,952 --> 01:13:56,997
No, no, Ivy,
it does not mean that you are a freak.

750
01:13:57,122 --> 01:13:58,999
Now, let me see.

751
01:13:59,124 --> 01:14:02,377
Well, you see, this man,
he's a very lonely man.

752
01:14:02,502 --> 01:14:07,216
And he sees something in you
that reminds him of his daughter,

753
01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:10,802
who he loved very much, but he lost her.

754
01:14:10,928 --> 01:14:14,306
But you can't believe that.
There's no way.

755
01:14:14,431 --> 01:14:17,601
It's just not possible.

756
01:14:17,726 --> 01:14:20,812
Is it possible or not?

757
01:14:21,647 --> 01:14:23,315
Ivy.

758
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,568
Mr Hoover seems to think so.

759
01:14:26,693 --> 01:14:28,737
But...

760
01:14:30,155 --> 01:14:35,494
It can't be true. I'm my own self
and I'm not somebody else.

761
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:39,790
- No wonder the girls are being so mean.
- Oh, Ivy.

762
01:14:39,915 --> 01:14:42,793
I'm so sorry about all of this.

763
01:14:42,918 --> 01:14:45,671
Listen, I'm taking you home with me.

764
01:14:45,796 --> 01:14:51,677
But Sylvester will be crowned day after
tomorrow. Can't I stay for that at least?

765
01:14:51,802 --> 01:14:54,513
We've all worked so hard on him.

766
01:14:54,638 --> 01:14:56,682
Well...

767
01:14:58,308 --> 01:15:01,144
You want to?

768
01:15:01,269 --> 01:15:03,313
OK.

769
01:15:04,606 --> 01:15:06,650
I love you.

770
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:18,704
And yet it'd be really wonderful,
wouldn't it, Mom?

771
01:15:18,829 --> 01:15:20,580
It'd be fantastic.

772
01:15:20,706 --> 01:15:22,624
What would be fantastic, babe?

773
01:15:22,749 --> 01:15:25,544
To live for ever and ever and never die.

774
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:28,422
Wouldn't it be wonderful, Mom?

775
01:15:28,547 --> 01:15:29,840
Yeah.

776
01:15:29,965 --> 01:15:34,803
Yep, it would be wonderful.
It'd be really terrific.

777
01:15:34,928 --> 01:15:38,014
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

778
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:16,178
Audrey...

779
01:16:17,345 --> 01:16:19,389
Hey, Audrey.

780
01:16:21,057 --> 01:16:25,228
Audrey Rose. Audrey Rose.

781
01:16:25,353 --> 01:16:28,607
Hey, Audrey Rose.

782
01:16:28,732 --> 01:16:31,276
Audrey Rose.

783
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:33,778
Hey, Audrey Rose.

784
01:16:33,904 --> 01:16:36,239
Audrey.

785
01:16:36,364 --> 01:16:38,408
Audrey Rose.

786
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:42,287
Audrey. Audrey Rose.

787
01:16:42,412 --> 01:16:44,915
Audrey Rose.

788
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,083
Hey, Audrey.

789
01:16:48,418 --> 01:16:50,754
Audrey.

790
01:16:50,879 --> 01:16:53,298
Audrey Rose.

791
01:16:53,423 --> 01:16:57,260
Hey, Audrey.

792
01:16:57,385 --> 01:16:59,888
Audrey.

793
01:17:00,013 --> 01:17:01,932
Audrey.

794
01:17:19,032 --> 01:17:22,953
Call Janice Templeton.
She knows the truth.

795
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:29,209
She knows in her heart that I'm
her only hope, if her child is to live.

796
01:17:29,334 --> 01:17:33,588
So, please, do as I say
and put her on the stand.

797
01:17:35,215 --> 01:17:38,510
Her aim is to put you
in jail, Mr Hoover.

798
01:17:40,011 --> 01:17:43,306
Quiet in the courtroom. Rise, please.

799
01:17:46,226 --> 01:17:48,269
Be seated.

800
01:17:49,813 --> 01:17:52,232
Mr Mack, call your next witness.

801
01:17:52,357 --> 01:17:54,818
The defence calls Mary Lou Sides.

802
01:18:25,223 --> 01:18:27,892
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you may give

803
01:18:28,018 --> 01:18:30,020
in the case now appearing
before this court

804
01:18:30,145 --> 01:18:34,816
shall be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

805
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:36,401
I do.

806
01:18:36,526 --> 01:18:41,239
11 years ago, Miss Sides,
1965, October 3rd,

807
01:18:41,364 --> 01:18:44,743
you were driving
on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, correct?

808
01:18:44,868 --> 01:18:46,286
Yes.

809
01:18:46,411 --> 01:18:49,789
You were involved in an accident
with another car.

810
01:18:49,914 --> 01:18:51,332
Yes.

811
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:54,711
An accident that left you paralysed.

812
01:18:54,836 --> 01:18:56,504
Yes.

813
01:18:57,464 --> 01:19:00,049
Who was in the other car?

814
01:19:00,175 --> 01:19:03,803
A woman named Sylvia Flora Hoover.

815
01:19:03,928 --> 01:19:05,972
And her daughter...

816
01:19:07,265 --> 01:19:08,892
Audrey Rose.

817
01:19:10,226 --> 01:19:16,316
Now, Miss Sides, I want you to tell the
jury exactly what happened that morning,

818
01:19:16,441 --> 01:19:19,027
as you saw it.

819
01:19:20,195 --> 01:19:24,616
I was on my way to work,
travelling east.

820
01:19:25,617 --> 01:19:27,911
It was stormy.

821
01:19:28,036 --> 01:19:31,414
Sheets of rain and hail.

822
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:33,416
I couldn't see.

823
01:19:34,584 --> 01:19:38,671
I tried to slow the car down,
but it began to skid.

824
01:19:39,839 --> 01:19:46,888
I tried to control the car, but I couldn't,
the wheel just twisted around in my hand.

825
01:19:48,097 --> 01:19:52,393
And then there was
this car coming toward me.

826
01:19:52,519 --> 01:19:54,562
And we hit each other.

827
01:19:56,189 --> 01:19:58,483
We crashed.

828
01:20:05,782 --> 01:20:07,992
We crashed.

829
01:20:08,117 --> 01:20:13,540
The other car went over the guard rail
and down this steep embankment

830
01:20:13,665 --> 01:20:16,376
and landed in a gully.

831
01:20:20,546 --> 01:20:22,590
And then I saw...

832
01:20:24,759 --> 01:20:27,095
I saw the face of a girl.

833
01:20:28,888 --> 01:20:30,932
A little girl.

834
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:35,645
She was looking
out of the window of the car.

835
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:37,981
She was screaming.

836
01:20:38,106 --> 01:20:40,608
Screaming and crying.

837
01:20:40,733 --> 01:20:42,694
"Daddy! Daddy!"

838
01:20:42,819 --> 01:20:44,445
"Daddy! Daddy!"

839
01:20:45,863 --> 01:20:50,702
And all at once the car went up
in flames. It was horrible.

840
01:20:51,577 --> 01:20:53,992
And I can see the girl,

841
01:20:54,142 --> 01:20:59,926
screaming and beating her hands
against the window,

842
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:02,380
and screaming,

843
01:21:02,505 --> 01:21:06,175
"Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!"

844
01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:10,471
Old Man Winter, disappear

845
01:21:10,596 --> 01:21:13,891
Stay away for one more year

846
01:21:14,017 --> 01:21:17,520
Old Man Winter, cold and done

847
01:21:17,645 --> 01:21:20,982
Leave us be, we matter none

848
01:21:21,107 --> 01:21:24,569
Old Man Winter, go away

849
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:42,879
Stop her! Stop her!

850
01:21:48,593 --> 01:21:49,719
Sister!

851
01:21:49,844 --> 01:21:52,055
Stop her! Stop her!

852
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,726
The child! Stop her!

853
01:21:56,851 --> 01:21:58,936
Stop her!

854
01:21:59,062 --> 01:22:01,105
The child! Stop her!

855
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:04,650
Stop her! Stop her!

856
01:22:06,027 --> 01:22:07,737
Stop her! The child!

857
01:22:07,862 --> 01:22:10,865
The child! Stop her!

858
01:22:19,332 --> 01:22:22,627
Lucky she was so well bundled
and there was all that snow around.

859
01:22:22,752 --> 01:22:24,921
Her body was completely untouched.

860
01:22:25,046 --> 01:22:30,176
Her face took some heat. However, there's
no indication of respiratory-tract damage.

861
01:22:30,301 --> 01:22:33,429
Nothing like this
has ever happened at St Luke's.

862
01:22:33,554 --> 01:22:38,017
And it needn't have happened this time.
What I'm saying is it was no accident.

863
01:22:38,142 --> 01:22:43,314
Your daughter literally walked
then crawled into that fire.

864
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:45,983
I'd like a muffin.

865
01:22:46,108 --> 01:22:47,860
- Baby.
- Hi, Daddy.

866
01:22:47,985 --> 01:22:51,405
- Please don't touch her.
- Hello, angel.

867
01:22:54,325 --> 01:22:57,203
They said
I walked into the fire on purpose.

868
01:22:57,328 --> 01:23:02,917
- I don't remember anything about it.
- Who said you did that, honey?

869
01:23:03,042 --> 01:23:06,128
- Mother did.
- She's wrong.

870
01:23:07,713 --> 01:23:11,259
What do you build fires for?
What business has that in a convent?

871
01:23:11,384 --> 01:23:15,840
We send our children to you for peace
and protection, and you build fires.

872
01:23:19,433 --> 01:23:24,021
- What's happening to me, Daddy?
- It was an accident, honey.

873
01:23:24,146 --> 01:23:28,526
But what made me do it?
Why? Why did I do it, Daddy? Why?

874
01:23:28,651 --> 01:23:33,406
It's all right now, princess.
It's all over, honey.

875
01:24:10,234 --> 01:24:11,569
Janice?

876
01:24:37,053 --> 01:24:40,723
- And you had a visitor that night?
- Yes.

877
01:24:40,848 --> 01:24:45,599
Er... Mr Hoover arrived
at the apartment house...

878
01:24:46,221 --> 01:24:48,680
er... some time around eleven.

879
01:24:48,814 --> 01:24:51,650
- Did you ask him up?
- Yes.

880
01:24:51,776 --> 01:24:54,987
- Why did you ask him up?
- Well, I needed help.

881
01:24:55,112 --> 01:24:58,991
- But wasn't the doctor coming?
- I needed Mr Hoover's help.

882
01:24:59,116 --> 01:25:01,952
Now, Your Honour,
if it please the court.

883
01:25:02,078 --> 01:25:06,290
It has come to my attention that Mrs
Templeton suffered a trauma yesterday,

884
01:25:06,415 --> 01:25:09,710
brought about by the injury
of her daughter in an accident.

885
01:25:09,835 --> 01:25:12,588
Mrs Templeton
is in a highly emotional state.

886
01:25:12,713 --> 01:25:15,091
She should be spared
the burden of testifying.

887
01:25:15,216 --> 01:25:19,804
This is a device by the prosecution
to prevent the witness from testifying.

888
01:25:19,929 --> 01:25:26,477
He knows that this witness's testimony
will destroy the prosecution's case.

889
01:25:26,602 --> 01:25:29,522
Mrs Templeton,
do you feel able to continue?

890
01:25:29,647 --> 01:25:34,401
- Yes, I do. I want to continue.
- Proceed, Mr Mack.

891
01:25:34,527 --> 01:25:36,570
Thank you, Your Honour.

892
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:40,950
And did Mr Hoover help you?

893
01:25:41,075 --> 01:25:43,452
Yes, almost at once.

894
01:25:43,577 --> 01:25:48,833
Ivy seemed to recognise him
and rushed into his arms

895
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:52,461
and, as he was comforting her,
she fell asleep.

896
01:25:53,754 --> 01:25:55,798
Mrs Templeton...

897
01:25:57,299 --> 01:26:00,219
do you believe in reincarnation?

898
01:26:01,554 --> 01:26:03,097
I do now.

899
01:26:04,098 --> 01:26:07,643
Mrs Templeton,
do you believe that your daughter Ivy

900
01:26:07,768 --> 01:26:11,230
is the reincarnation
of Mr Hoover's daughter Audrey Rose?

901
01:26:14,608 --> 01:26:16,360
Yes.

902
01:26:18,362 --> 01:26:19,446
Order!

903
01:26:23,909 --> 01:26:25,953
Mrs Templeton,

904
01:26:26,078 --> 01:26:30,499
do you believe that Mr Hoover
kidnapped your daughter?

905
01:26:30,624 --> 01:26:32,209
No, I do not.

906
01:26:32,334 --> 01:26:34,378
I believe that the only help my daughter

907
01:26:34,503 --> 01:26:37,590
will ever receive on this earth
is through Mr Hoover.

908
01:26:37,715 --> 01:26:42,928
The only chance she has of living
is if this man is released from jail.

909
01:26:44,592 --> 01:26:46,348
Order!

910
01:26:46,473 --> 01:26:49,268
Order! Order!

911
01:26:52,771 --> 01:26:54,898
Order!

912
01:26:55,024 --> 01:26:57,985
Your Honour, that's our case.

913
01:26:58,110 --> 01:27:00,863
Mr Velie, you may cross-examine.

914
01:27:01,655 --> 01:27:03,949
Your Honour.

915
01:27:04,074 --> 01:27:06,744
In view of Mrs Templeton's testimony,

916
01:27:06,869 --> 01:27:09,455
and because
of her overwrought condition,

917
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:12,958
I request a recess
until tomorrow morning.

918
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:17,796
Very well. Court will reconvene
tomorrow morning at 9.00am.

919
01:28:09,598 --> 01:28:13,852
Ruth, place a call to Doctors' Hospital
in Porchester.

920
01:28:13,977 --> 01:28:18,232
I'd like to speak to the physician
in charge of Ivy Templeton's case.

921
01:28:18,357 --> 01:28:20,442
This whole thing is outlandish.

922
01:28:20,567 --> 01:28:23,195
A test like that could not
possibly be conclusive

923
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,823
and it could prove dangerous
to the child.

924
01:28:25,948 --> 01:28:29,076
How about that, Mr Velie?
There is an element of danger here.

925
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:31,620
Well,
the father has granted his permission.

926
01:28:31,745 --> 01:28:36,458
I've been assured by the doctor that she
is physically able to withstand the test.

927
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:39,378
He foresees no problems
from such an experiment.

928
01:28:39,503 --> 01:28:42,756
He's even willing to provide
the facilities to conduct it.

929
01:28:42,881 --> 01:28:46,510
- Any precedents for such an experiment?
- Yes.

930
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:50,639
In Wyler vs Fairchild,
the court permitted a witness to testify

931
01:28:50,764 --> 01:28:54,893
after undergoing hypnosis and did not
consider it an abuse of discretion.

932
01:28:55,018 --> 01:28:56,937
He is trying to stampede the jury,

933
01:28:57,062 --> 01:29:00,941
a circus show for the sole purpose
of ridiculing my client and his beliefs.

934
01:29:01,066 --> 01:29:05,279
All right, let's drop
the formalities, boys.

935
01:29:05,404 --> 01:29:09,366
Now, I've given you a hell of a wide
latitude in presenting your case.

936
01:29:09,491 --> 01:29:12,411
And now you want me
to restrict the prosecution's right

937
01:29:12,536 --> 01:29:15,789
to pursue its own path
to the truth on rebuttal?

938
01:29:15,914 --> 01:29:19,626
Scott, I don't know
about this test of yours.

939
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:22,629
If I'm gonna permit it,
I want to know the specifications...

940
01:29:22,754 --> 01:29:25,674
who's going to conduct it,
what his qualifications are,

941
01:29:25,799 --> 01:29:30,304
and if there is any possibility
of it being harmful to the child.

942
01:29:30,429 --> 01:29:34,349
I think I can satisfy your doubts,
Your Honour.

943
01:29:34,474 --> 01:29:37,894
I'll reserve my decision until you do.

944
01:30:49,508 --> 01:30:50,717
Hello?

945
01:30:50,842 --> 01:30:55,097
Judge Langley's office. Court will convene
this morning at Doctors' Hospital.

946
01:30:55,222 --> 01:30:57,516
- The hospital? When?
- 9.00.

947
01:30:57,641 --> 01:30:59,810
It's a hypnotic test on your daughter.

948
01:30:59,935 --> 01:31:03,980
- Has my husband given permission?
- Mr Templeton has agreed to the test...

949
01:31:16,618 --> 01:31:19,204
Dr Dorman, you are wanted in emergency.

950
01:31:19,329 --> 01:31:21,998
Judge Langley!

951
01:31:22,749 --> 01:31:27,295
Judge Langley, I object to this test.
I won't have my child submit to it.

952
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:31,341
Mrs Templeton, I have been personally
assured by the psychiatrist

953
01:31:31,466 --> 01:31:34,928
that no possible harm can come
to your child as a result of the test.

954
01:31:35,053 --> 01:31:36,680
Please, try to understand.

955
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:41,017
Your husband, who has equal rights of
consent in this matter, agrees to the test.

956
01:31:41,143 --> 01:31:44,729
Now, I realise this
is a very unusual matter.

957
01:31:47,816 --> 01:31:50,035
When it's ajar.

958
01:31:52,946 --> 01:31:54,865
Hi, Mom.

959
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:59,953
Hi, sweetheart. Could I have
a few moments alone with my daughter?

960
01:32:00,078 --> 01:32:02,122
Why, certainly.

961
01:32:06,877 --> 01:32:10,171
They're going to hypnotise me
to find out why I do these things.

962
01:32:10,297 --> 01:32:13,633
You're not going through with it.
I'm not gonna let them do it.

963
01:32:13,758 --> 01:32:18,722
But I want to. I want to know what's wrong
with me. I want to know who I am.

964
01:32:18,847 --> 01:32:21,683
Who you are?
You are Ivy Templeton, my daughter.

965
01:32:21,808 --> 01:32:27,522
- But Mr Hoover says I'm his daughter.
- Ivy, you are my child.

966
01:32:27,647 --> 01:32:32,110
I'm not sure any more who I am, Mom.
And I want to know. I've gotta know.

967
01:32:32,235 --> 01:32:35,989
- I am taking you home with me.
- No, I wanna stay.

968
01:32:37,574 --> 01:32:38,825
Janice.

969
01:32:40,785 --> 01:32:43,455
I wanna talk to you outside.

970
01:32:49,544 --> 01:32:51,588
You mustn't let them do this to her.

971
01:32:51,713 --> 01:32:54,758
I know what you want.
To turn my child over to Elliot Hoover.

972
01:32:54,883 --> 01:32:57,218
No, I want what's best for her.

973
01:32:57,344 --> 01:33:01,181
I am doing what's best for her.
Now, if you don't mind, they're ready.

974
01:33:01,306 --> 01:33:06,061
No, please, Bill.
For God's sake, please don't do this.

975
01:33:06,186 --> 01:33:09,439
Don't do what? Destroy the man
who's robbing me of my family?

976
01:33:09,564 --> 01:33:12,067
Don't destroy our child.

977
01:33:18,657 --> 01:33:21,951
What we're attempting
is unique in the annals of psychiatry.

978
01:33:22,077 --> 01:33:25,705
To regress a subject hypnotically
into a former lifetime has never,

979
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:30,835
to my knowledge, fallen with the purview
of serious psychiatric inquiry.

980
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:35,757
True, there are hypnotists who have had
subjects claim, under hypnosis,

981
01:33:35,882 --> 01:33:37,926
that they've lived before,

982
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:40,011
and that while in the hypnotic state

983
01:33:40,136 --> 01:33:44,933
had spoken languages that they
did not know in the awakened state.

984
01:33:45,058 --> 01:33:48,395
While I have never participated in
nor witnessed such an event,

985
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:51,439
I am here at the behest of the court
to perform a function

986
01:33:51,564 --> 01:33:55,485
for which I have been trained
and am licensed to perform.

987
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:59,614
I will be hypnotising the subject who
will be brought to me while you watch.

988
01:33:59,739 --> 01:34:03,910
But as observers it is important
you stay totally alert and awake,

989
01:34:04,035 --> 01:34:07,539
completely alert and awake.

990
01:34:07,664 --> 01:34:10,834
Before I bring in the subject,
let me warn you that regression

991
01:34:10,959 --> 01:34:14,462
will frequently arouse memories
of a traumatic nature.

992
01:34:14,587 --> 01:34:18,925
The subject may even cry out
or display bizarre personality changes.

993
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:21,177
This is normal and to be expected,

994
01:34:21,302 --> 01:34:24,681
but will not prove harmful to the child
in any permanent way.

995
01:34:24,806 --> 01:34:27,100
We'll now bring her in.

996
01:34:35,942 --> 01:34:38,278
Hello, Ivy. Come over here.

997
01:34:40,029 --> 01:34:42,323
Sit right here, hm?

998
01:34:43,741 --> 01:34:45,743
Thank you.

999
01:34:57,255 --> 01:34:59,299
Now, relax, Ivy.

1000
01:35:01,217 --> 01:35:06,848
Relax and allow every muscle
in your body to become loose and limp.

1001
01:35:07,807 --> 01:35:13,313
Now, as we discussed this morning,
you will not be harmed in any way,

1002
01:35:13,438 --> 01:35:18,568
but would simply
begin to feel very relaxed.

1003
01:35:20,403 --> 01:35:22,447
Very relaxed.

1004
01:35:23,573 --> 01:35:25,617
Very comfortable.

1005
01:35:26,993 --> 01:35:31,623
So that you will wish
to go to sleep for a while.

1006
01:35:31,748 --> 01:35:35,126
You will not mind
going to sleep for a while?

1007
01:35:35,251 --> 01:35:37,378
- No, I won't mind.
- Good.

1008
01:35:39,297 --> 01:35:42,383
Soon you will begin to feel relaxed.

1009
01:35:44,344 --> 01:35:46,763
And more comfortable.

1010
01:35:47,597 --> 01:35:50,141
More and more comfortable.

1011
01:35:51,059 --> 01:35:55,897
Watch the light, Ivy. Keep watching it.

1012
01:35:58,316 --> 01:36:04,447
Now, as you're watching it, you're
beginning to feel your eyes grow heavy.

1013
01:36:05,448 --> 01:36:12,205
Your eyelids are getting heavier,
so heavy that you want to close them.

1014
01:36:14,624 --> 01:36:17,752
Your eyelids are getting heavier.

1015
01:36:17,877 --> 01:36:23,132
And you're finding it harder and harder
to keep them open.

1016
01:36:25,385 --> 01:36:30,264
Your eyelids are getting so heavy...
so heavy...

1017
01:36:31,849 --> 01:36:33,893
so heavy...

1018
01:36:35,728 --> 01:36:38,272
that you cannot keep them open.

1019
01:36:40,233 --> 01:36:44,570
So heavy... that you must close them.

1020
01:36:45,947 --> 01:36:47,949
Must close them...

1021
01:36:48,783 --> 01:36:50,368
close them...

1022
01:36:51,536 --> 01:36:53,579
close them.

1023
01:36:59,335 --> 01:37:01,379
There.

1024
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:04,632
You cannot open your eyes.

1025
01:37:06,759 --> 01:37:11,180
They're so heavy
that they simply must stay closed.

1026
01:37:12,598 --> 01:37:16,561
You're safe and snug
and fully asleep now.

1027
01:37:18,354 --> 01:37:20,815
Fully asleep.

1028
01:37:21,691 --> 01:37:24,110
When I wish to awaken you,
I will count to five.

1029
01:37:24,235 --> 01:37:29,365
I will say "Awaken, Ivy" and you will
awaken promptly. Do you understand?

1030
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:31,534
- Yes.
- Good.

1031
01:37:33,703 --> 01:37:37,540
Now that you're deeply asleep
and completely relaxed,

1032
01:37:37,665 --> 01:37:41,502
you're gradually moving back in time.

1033
01:37:41,627 --> 01:37:44,630
Back, back, Ivy.

1034
01:37:44,755 --> 01:37:46,799
Back in time.

1035
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:52,013
You're moving back
to your eighth birthday.

1036
01:37:52,138 --> 01:37:56,684
When I count to three, you will be
back at your eighth birthday party.

1037
01:37:56,809 --> 01:38:01,439
You will open your eyes,
but will remain deeply relaxed.

1038
01:38:01,564 --> 01:38:03,232
Ready?

1039
01:38:03,357 --> 01:38:05,067
One.

1040
01:38:05,193 --> 01:38:06,694
Two.

1041
01:38:06,819 --> 01:38:08,863
Three.

1042
01:38:09,822 --> 01:38:13,826
You're now at your party
amongst your friends.

1043
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:16,287
Do you see your friends, Ivy?

1044
01:38:16,412 --> 01:38:19,707
Tell me about them. Who's at the party?

1045
01:38:22,043 --> 01:38:25,213
There's Bettina.

1046
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:28,883
And Carrie.

1047
01:38:29,008 --> 01:38:31,052
Mary-Ellen.

1048
01:38:32,261 --> 01:38:34,847
The twins.

1049
01:38:34,972 --> 01:38:36,515
Peter.

1050
01:38:37,808 --> 01:38:40,478
Do you love your presents, Ivy?

1051
01:38:40,603 --> 01:38:46,359
Oh, yes, especially my Terry Doll
with travel wardrobe.

1052
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:53,115
And my flute game Bettina bought me.

1053
01:38:54,825 --> 01:38:59,580
Let's leave this party now
and go back to an earlier birthday.

1054
01:38:59,705 --> 01:39:05,044
I want you to go back in time
to your fourth birthday party.

1055
01:39:05,962 --> 01:39:12,593
I will count to three, then you will be
at your fourth birthday party.

1056
01:39:12,718 --> 01:39:15,012
Just relax, now.

1057
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,225
Ready?

1058
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:20,768
One.

1059
01:39:20,893 --> 01:39:21,978
Two.

1060
01:39:22,103 --> 01:39:24,146
Three.

1061
01:39:25,898 --> 01:39:31,362
Did your parents buy you this nice
birthday cake with four lovely candles?

1062
01:39:31,487 --> 01:39:34,448
No, they didn't buy it.

1063
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:37,159
Too expensive.

1064
01:39:37,284 --> 01:39:39,495
Mommy made it from a magazine.

1065
01:39:45,084 --> 01:39:48,671
Well, what are you feeling? Let it go.

1066
01:39:50,464 --> 01:39:52,550
He broke it.

1067
01:39:52,675 --> 01:39:55,928
This little boy broke my monkey.

1068
01:40:10,067 --> 01:40:11,569
It's all right, Ivy.

1069
01:40:11,694 --> 01:40:16,532
It's all right. We'll leave this party now
and we'll move farther back in time.

1070
01:40:16,657 --> 01:40:19,577
Farther back. Way back.

1071
01:40:19,702 --> 01:40:25,916
I want you to go back to a time when
you can see and hear and feel and think...

1072
01:40:28,043 --> 01:40:30,504
but you cannot say any words.

1073
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:35,301
You're just a little baby
in Mummy's arms now.

1074
01:40:36,844 --> 01:40:40,306
And maybe she's putting you
into your carriage.

1075
01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:53,903
Ah, very good, Ivy.

1076
01:40:55,154 --> 01:40:57,198
Very good.

1077
01:40:58,699 --> 01:41:03,037
Now we're going to go
even farther back in time.

1078
01:41:03,162 --> 01:41:05,414
Way back.

1079
01:41:05,539 --> 01:41:07,082
Way back.

1080
01:41:09,043 --> 01:41:12,922
To a time before you were born.

1081
01:41:13,047 --> 01:41:15,508
Before you were born.

1082
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:19,011
Before you were born.

1083
01:41:20,721 --> 01:41:22,765
Before you were born.

1084
01:41:23,766 --> 01:41:25,809
Before you were born.

1085
01:41:26,685 --> 01:41:28,729
Before you were born.

1086
01:41:38,155 --> 01:41:40,199
Very good, Ivy.

1087
01:41:44,745 --> 01:41:48,540
Back. Back, Ivy, back in time.

1088
01:41:51,418 --> 01:41:54,922
At a time before
you existed as yourself.

1089
01:41:57,633 --> 01:42:00,803
The time before you were Ivy.

1090
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:09,520
When you were not Ivy...
but you were another person.

1091
01:42:12,273 --> 01:42:15,693
To the time just before you were Ivy.

1092
01:42:18,028 --> 01:42:21,156
Not Ivy, but somebody else.

1093
01:42:22,574 --> 01:42:24,868
Somebody else.

1094
01:42:25,911 --> 01:42:30,874
To the last moment
you can remember in your previous life.

1095
01:42:32,167 --> 01:42:36,797
When you were not Ivy...
but somebody else.

1096
01:42:38,215 --> 01:42:40,259
Somebody else.

1097
01:42:43,345 --> 01:42:45,389
Who are you?

1098
01:42:45,597 --> 01:42:47,266
I'm...

1099
01:42:47,391 --> 01:42:50,060
Who are you?

1100
01:42:51,645 --> 01:42:53,689
Who are you?

1101
01:42:56,066 --> 01:42:58,110
Who are you?

1102
01:42:59,528 --> 01:43:01,572
Who are you?

1103
01:43:04,742 --> 01:43:06,785
Who are you?

1104
01:43:18,505 --> 01:43:19,882
M...

1105
01:43:20,007 --> 01:43:23,469
Mommy. Mommy.

1106
01:43:23,594 --> 01:43:27,014
Mommy. Mommy.

1107
01:43:27,139 --> 01:43:29,016
Mommy.

1108
01:43:29,141 --> 01:43:31,018
Mommy.

1109
01:43:31,143 --> 01:43:32,186
Mommy.

1110
01:43:32,936 --> 01:43:34,897
Mommy.

1111
01:43:35,022 --> 01:43:37,065
Mommy.

1112
01:43:37,191 --> 01:43:40,778
Mommy. Mommy.

1113
01:43:40,903 --> 01:43:44,406
Mommy. Mommy.

1114
01:43:47,075 --> 01:43:49,119
Mommy.

1115
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:52,122
Mommy?

1116
01:43:52,247 --> 01:43:54,208
Mommy?

1117
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:57,127
Mommy? Mommy?

1118
01:43:57,252 --> 01:43:59,755
Mommy? Mommy?

1119
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,548
Mommy? Mommy?

1120
01:44:02,382 --> 01:44:03,425
Mommy!

1121
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:05,511
Mommy! Mommy!

1122
01:44:05,636 --> 01:44:07,638
Mommy! Mommy!

1123
01:44:07,763 --> 01:44:08,805
Mommy!

1124
01:44:08,931 --> 01:44:11,767
- Mommy! Mommy!
- It's all right.

1125
01:44:11,892 --> 01:44:14,728
It's all right, Ivy.
You will leave this memory now.

1126
01:44:14,853 --> 01:44:19,066
It's all right. You can go back in time
even farther, away from this memory.

1127
01:44:19,191 --> 01:44:21,026
- Mommy!
- Ivy!

1128
01:44:21,151 --> 01:44:25,322
When I count to three,
you will be even farther back in time.

1129
01:44:25,447 --> 01:44:27,908
One, two, three.

1130
01:44:31,787 --> 01:44:34,206
- Mommy!
- One, two, three.

1131
01:44:34,331 --> 01:44:37,834
Can you hear me, Ivy? Can you hear me?

1132
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,128
Ivy, can you hear me?

1133
01:44:40,587 --> 01:44:42,297
One, two...

1134
01:44:43,048 --> 01:44:44,258
Ivy!

1135
01:44:44,383 --> 01:44:45,759
Ivy.

1136
01:44:47,177 --> 01:44:49,805
Can you hear me, Ivy?

1137
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:51,640
Ivy? Ivy?

1138
01:44:52,516 --> 01:44:54,309
Can you hear me?

1139
01:44:54,434 --> 01:44:56,436
Ivy?

1140
01:44:57,562 --> 01:44:59,856
Can you hear me, Ivy?

1141
01:44:59,982 --> 01:45:01,900
She's not Ivy.

1142
01:45:02,818 --> 01:45:04,861
Ivy?

1143
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,537
She'll be all right, Your Honour.
She'll come out of it.

1144
01:45:13,662 --> 01:45:16,123
You will now awaken, Ivy.

1145
01:45:16,248 --> 01:45:20,794
When I count to five, you will awaken
promptly and feel rested and well.

1146
01:45:21,753 --> 01:45:23,797
Rested and well.

1147
01:45:24,673 --> 01:45:29,428
One. Two. Three.

1148
01:45:29,553 --> 01:45:33,807
Four. Five.

1149
01:45:34,891 --> 01:45:36,935
Awaken, Ivy.

1150
01:46:03,670 --> 01:46:06,548
Ivy! You will awaken.

1151
01:46:07,382 --> 01:46:10,552
Four. Five. Awaken, Ivy.

1152
01:46:10,677 --> 01:46:13,305
- She's not Ivy.
- Awaken, Ivy.

1153
01:46:15,814 --> 01:46:18,292
Ivy. Awaken, Ivy.

1154
01:46:19,728 --> 01:46:23,482
- Daddy, help.
- Four, five.

1155
01:46:23,607 --> 01:46:25,692
Awaken, Ivy.

1156
01:46:26,234 --> 01:46:28,820
Ivy, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Ivy?

1157
01:46:28,945 --> 01:46:33,074
- Audrey Rose!
- One. Two.

1158
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,786
Three. Four. Five.

1159
01:46:36,912 --> 01:46:39,915
- Two... Ivy!
- I want this test stopped immediately.

1160
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:43,543
When I count to five,
I order you to awaken. One. Two.

1161
01:46:43,668 --> 01:46:45,670
Damn it, I want it stopped.

1162
01:46:45,796 --> 01:46:48,048
Can you hear me, Ivy?

1163
01:46:48,173 --> 01:46:51,092
- Audrey Rose!
- Can you hear me?

1164
01:46:51,218 --> 01:46:52,928
- Audrey Rose!
- Ivy!

1165
01:46:53,053 --> 01:46:55,806
- Judge Langley, stop the test!
- Audrey Rose!

1166
01:46:55,931 --> 01:47:00,143
- Audrey Rose, it's Daddy! It's Daddy!
- Oh, my God!

1167
01:47:00,268 --> 01:47:05,190
- One. Two.
- Audrey Rose, it's Daddy. It's Daddy.

1168
01:47:05,315 --> 01:47:07,192
- Ivy.
- Do something.

1169
01:47:07,317 --> 01:47:09,069
Stop it.

1170
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:46,606
Look, this is the child's mother.

1171
01:49:06,478 --> 01:49:09,105
It's all right now.

1172
01:49:09,230 --> 01:49:13,234
It's all right. Her soul is set free.

1173
01:49:14,944 --> 01:49:17,155
Her soul is set free.

1174
01:49:18,448 --> 01:49:23,161
It's all right now.
Her soul is set free.

1175
01:49:24,204 --> 01:49:28,124
- No.
- Yes, her soul is set free.

1176
01:49:30,627 --> 01:49:33,088
Her soul is free.

1177
01:49:34,339 --> 01:49:37,300
Her soul is free.

1178
01:49:37,425 --> 01:49:39,803
It is free.

1179
01:49:39,928 --> 01:49:42,388
It is free.

1180
01:49:48,853 --> 01:49:50,980
Dear Mr Hoover,

1181
01:49:51,105 --> 01:49:54,192
it is good to know that you are in India

1182
01:49:54,317 --> 01:50:00,490
doing all the things you must
for the peace of our daughter's soul.

1183
01:50:01,533 --> 01:50:03,785
I include Bill in my thanks,

1184
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:08,800
even though he still cannot accept
the idea

1185
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:12,137
that while Ivy's body is gone,

1186
01:50:12,262 --> 01:50:14,963
her soul continues to exist.

1187
01:50:15,630 --> 01:50:19,425
Yet I know in my heart it is true

1188
01:50:19,551 --> 01:50:21,761
and that you are right.

1189
01:50:21,886 --> 01:50:24,556
And that is what sustains me.

1190
01:50:24,681 --> 01:50:28,560
In permitting you
to take Ivy's ashes to India,

1191
01:50:28,685 --> 01:50:31,729
I believe that Bill
has taken the first step

1192
01:50:31,855 --> 01:50:37,318
toward understanding
that we are all immortal.

1193
01:50:38,361 --> 01:50:41,656
Know that I add my prayers to yours

1194
01:50:41,781 --> 01:50:46,494
for our daughter's soul to mend itself

1195
01:50:47,662 --> 01:50:50,662
and find the peace

1196
01:50:50,802 --> 01:50:55,487
and fulfilment in heaven

1197
01:50:55,612 --> 01:50:59,299
that it was denied in its earth life,

1198
01:50:59,424 --> 01:51:05,054
and that the day will come
when her soul will feel free

1199
01:51:05,179 --> 01:51:09,434
and able to seek a new rebirth,

1200
01:51:09,559 --> 01:51:14,355
and that when it does
she will find parents

1201
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:19,652
who are, oh, generous, understanding,

1202
01:51:20,737 --> 01:51:25,742
and who will love her
as we all loved her.
