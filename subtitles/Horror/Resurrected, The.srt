1
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:47,144
The Mummy resurrected

2
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,817
- Maggie.
- Hello.

3
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:19,028
I need you inside,
Geri did a version...

4
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,446
HieroglHfica the "Pictionaria".

5
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,283
Can you believe it?
Did he really come?

6
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,371
Santa arrives at the hotel tonight at 18:30.

7
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:33,250
Do you think a vigil
outside is a good idea?

8
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,668
Am I being childish?

9
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,712
Considering how they should be here...

10
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,339
Been waiting for two days.

11
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,507
I know, I should not be so excited, but...

12
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,301
- I can not contain myself.

13
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:45,596
You know,
plus occasional photos...

14
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,973
You have not seen... or heard of it...

15
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,726
In almost 20 years.

16
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,354
I just want you to control
their expectations, that's all.

17
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,814
If this does not correspond to the same...

18
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,317
- Enthusiasm.
- Of course.

19
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,693
It's my father.

20
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,986
I hope so.

21
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,697
You can not know for sure how someone is.

22
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,991
I think so.

23
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,534
And how do you know?

24
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,328
I can feel it.

25
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,121
Always have these feelings?

26
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,833
Yes, I know of no person
in their right mind would do that.

27
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,213
We should not enter?

28
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,799
She tried, I'll wait out here.

29
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:25,719
And you will lose all the drama
Geri game invented?

30
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,180
Hey!
They will not come?

31
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,224
I spent all night doing this thing.

32
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,975
His father will finally arrive.

33
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,727
- Seriously, is it?
- Yes

34
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,437
- Now?
- Girls.

35
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:36,688
Let's go.

36
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,774
- I know.
- You can enter?

37
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,111
- Please?
- Okay, and you listened.

38
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,570
At long departure.

39
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,323
Okay, listen.
The party is over.

40
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,833
Girl, look at you.

41
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,211
What a beautiful woman you've become!

42
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,298
- Hello.
- Come here and give your old man a hug.

43
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,058
You look like your mother.

44
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,186
I loved her more than his own life.

45
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,231
Which means...

46
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,150
I'll love you even more.

47
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,487
I see you brought the whole
class of "moral support".

48
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,990
Mr. Tralane, nice to meet you finally.

49
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,616
I've heard a lot about you.

50
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:30,993
Of course.

51
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,579
You can not leave a mark that lasts.

52
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,998
If you always walk on tiptoes.

53
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,918
Father, this is Veronica Korvac.

54
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,297
Yes, I am eternally grateful.

55
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,968
You know, I do not think it would been able
to bring my daughter here without you.

56
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,638
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, too.

57
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,141
I am a big fan.

58
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,059
Ever since.

59
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,062
Looks like I have some of those days.

60
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,191
'M Geri... Grant.

61
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,151
Yes, of course you're the...

62
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,987
The girl who found the last two
burial sites.

63
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,240
- That's right.
- Well, I must say I'm a fan of yours.

64
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,326
Very well, dear.

65
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,619
Well done.

66
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,329
Last but not least...

67
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,830
Sara Winchester.

68
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,290
Kelly Kennedy.

69
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,833
Kennedy.

70
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,170
Look at you.

71
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,588
It's so refreshing.

72
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,590
It is so refreshing to work again with...

73
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,592
Spirits so young and full of energy.

74
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,595
Now who wants to come with me for a drink?

75
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,184
You must have had a very long journey,
surely you are tired.

76
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,894
It does not matter.

77
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,063
Okay, how about...

78
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,275
The update.
Long ago.

79
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,778
Well, this is your room.

80
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,696
See you in the morning.

81
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,461
Before you go,
I have something for you.

82
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,593
Not the original.

83
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,512
He has been missing for decades.

84
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:18,183
But it is an excellent copy,
1 of 2 replicas in your hand.

85
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,185
Where did you get that?

86
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,271
I've been in many places.

87
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,732
I managed with some Armenian friends.

88
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,568
It was expensive, but worth it.

89
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,361
Cartography is amazing.

90
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,697
Looks like we're in the same place.

91
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,282
I think you get the idea.

92
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,077
But I really need that Miss
Winchester and you translate the terms.

93
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,329
Unless you can.

94
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,085
No, you stay with it for now.

95
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,046
I hope you do not try to bribe me.

96
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,092
Maggie.

97
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,512
I know I have not done
a good job for you.

98
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,014
And I'm sorry.

99
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,933
But although it sounds clichfi.

100
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,435
I had my reasons.

101
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,894
Let's go.

102
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,396
I forgot.

103
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,315
We're together now.

104
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,859
As I hope will be for a long time.

105
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,987
If you depend on me, baby.

106
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,947
Will be forever.

107
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,921
'M Madu, his connection with the SCA.

108
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,090
Sorry for the intrusion.

109
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,760
But I can not take them
to the region tomorrow.

110
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,887
And, for your own safety...

111
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,264
I revoke your permission.

112
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,017
There is evil in the Valley.

113
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,894
A great, great evil.

114
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,563
He swore that all who come to the Valley.

115
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,273
Raiders of the unspeakable.

116
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,983
"Never come back".

117
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:04,988
Sorcerer Valley.

118
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,283
Now I see why your guides
government does not want to go.

119
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,702
But you will. Right?

120
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,039
You are not afraid of old superstitions.

121
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,585
Border guards in Libya are not a myth.

122
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,671
They make many excursions along the border.

123
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,673
More than anything at night but...

124
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,508
At times during the day.

125
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,178
Looking for prey.

126
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,305
As you and your group.

127
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,599
In this case, we are not just guides.

128
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,478
We are also...

129
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,563
Protection.

130
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,817
I need more money.

131
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:44,986
And early

132
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,238
$ 700.

133
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,617
Not a penny more,
half now, half in return.

134
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,083
And where do we take it?

135
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,379
I'm sure there will be many
who would like to earn $ 700.

136
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,562
I think the term is...
"We have an agreement."

137
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,251
Come on everybody time to load things.

138
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,552
What?

139
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,970
Mr. Madu retired.

140
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,055
So we had to find an alternative.

141
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,932
They are able to get a license?

142
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,684
We do not need one now.

143
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,394
My father and I will
take care of that later.

144
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,272
Do not tell me that you took the
Kool-Aid after a day.

145
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,232
It does not form part of the same...

146
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,151
Archaeological excavation in this country.

147
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,986
Much less carry one.

148
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,738
He leads, I do.

149
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,990
Then act in the rules, so you do not...

150
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,242
Ruin his career before it began.

151
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,327
Come on, we'll be fine.

152
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,080
They are very strict about
excavations in this country.

153
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,416
You know, Tralane know.

154
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,876
I know what, honey?

155
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,963
You need a license.

156
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,508
No, if you will only find the tomb.

157
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,261
We'll be fine,
while we do not change anything there.

158
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,598
Right? We can not miss the day..

159
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:45,982
I do not know, it sounded version
archeology of "just the tip".

160
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,943
And we all know how
you enjoy playing it.

161
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,949
Sorry Teacher.

162
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,452
- Yes?
- I've seen it.

163
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,872
And it seems that a part of it, is lost.

164
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,624
- Seriously?
- Yes

165
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,460
All pages after
Van Heim reach the tomb.

166
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,962
It is as if they had been removed.

167
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,054
You're right.

168
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:20,100
It seems my Armenian friends were mild.

169
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,603
They sold me damaged goods bastards.

170
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,356
Now what?

171
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,317
The story is there for us to write.

172
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,390
Made all the lists?

173
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,227
I think we should leave the team.

174
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,854
Not even enter the tomb.

175
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,022
Just make sure to fill your water bottle.

176
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,649
We need to stay hydrated here.

177
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,317
- Well, come on.
- Okay.

178
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,296
What was that?

179
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,173
Nothing my dear, nothing.

180
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,800
Just go walking.

181
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,760
Come on, now, now.

182
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,649
We should...

183
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,620
So what was this great evil...

184
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,830
Mr. Madu was so afraid?

185
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,874
Nothing.

186
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,210
Just nonsense.

187
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:14,797
They helped create the
mystery that is Egypt.

188
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,591
Seemed very convincing.

189
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,806
Surely you have the
determination to Tralane.

190
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,852
In the old days there was a...

191
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,063
Great Wizard.

192
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,774
A king or queen...

193
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,861
That... was erased from history forever.

194
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,698
A great, great sorcerer.

195
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,910
He had no name, no name.

196
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:48,122
And who said that his name
could disappear from life.

197
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:53,002
Something worse than death, nothing.

198
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,797
To resurface again in the other world.

199
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,883
And that is what we seek?

200
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,178
That, dear,
is what you will find.

201
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,142
Let's go?

202
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,008
Hey, here.

203
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,219
You see the hieroglyphics destroyed
at the entrance of the tomb?

204
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,764
Was to confuse the messengers of Anubis.

205
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,894
Come on, come on.

206
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,682
Here it is.

207
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,564
I can not believe he's here.

208
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,192
What does this mean in
the old Van Heim now?

209
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,903
Hey, wait a second.

210
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:45,114
And if we return to the village
to see if you get a license?

211
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,284
- Now?
- I do not want to miss this discovery.

212
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,869
By a simple procedure.

213
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,704
I said I would not enter the tomb...

214
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,373
here is allowed.

215
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,665
And I meant it.

216
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,334
I'm the boss, remember?

217
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,544
Yes, sorry boss.

218
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,720
What are they doing,
is not yet time to go...

219
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,263
Has sun for hours.

220
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:10,723
Insurance is nothing.

221
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,810
You continue to work and I did.

222
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,605
Something wrong?

223
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,023
It seems that something is wrong.

224
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,859
- All is well.
- It looks very ugly.

225
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,861
Let's take a look.

226
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,865
It's not safe here now.

227
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,784
Do not waste my time.

228
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,327
Right?

229
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,290
I see nothing.

230
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,252
Probably, just want to take
the money from his father.

231
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,087
They do it all the time.

232
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,089
What is this cloud of dust?

233
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,091
Seems chenado close.

234
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,843
Cloud of dust?

235
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,636
- Seriously?
- Whatever.

236
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,430
Surely will only follow your path.

237
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:53,099
We are here at the top, right?

238
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,726
Come on, do not we have more
important things to do?

239
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,353
Yes, we have.

240
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,355
Come on, we'll be fine.

241
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,941
My dad will not let anything
bad happen to us.

242
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,609
Libyan guards are here.

243
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,778
Shut up, we're here.

244
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,996
They are here now.

245
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,206
Take care of them.

246
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,083
Come see, come.

247
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,911
I thought you translated this.

248
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,040
Well, all arranged.

249
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,334
See, false alarm.

250
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,127
Okay?

251
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,255
Yes, of course.

252
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:10,301
They wanted to talk about charges
additional and extra work hours.

253
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,136
More importantly, what happens here?

254
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,930
At this time, nothing.

255
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,182
Looks like someone is a little rusty.

256
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,351
I think it should be on a wall.

257
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,479
Yes, it was all too good to be true, right?

258
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:24,482
Things are a bit cryptic at the moment.

259
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,150
After researching.

260
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,904
I discovered that the key
is in building the car.

261
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,448
Although it is not imaginary.

262
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,992
Then, the letters "AMAMPMD".

263
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,411
- So the word "bear".
- Bear.

264
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,705
It is written in the
margin on the car floor.

265
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,165
Set the car.

266
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:42,959
The assembly in the car.

267
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,669
Or inside the bear.

268
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,547
Yes...

269
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,341
They are colloquial 17th century.

270
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,468
Track or any other words of wisdom?

271
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:53,970
That's it.

272
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,764
He wrote that when he opened the tomb...

273
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,183
The sun had set,
with his guards left.

274
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,518
Then there are a couple of pages...

275
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,895
Was so excited, I could not sleep.

276
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,231
He was vigilant in heaven
that guided me.

277
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,400
But nothing more.

278
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,236
Set the car.

279
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,197
- Or Bear?
- Perhaps talked about...

280
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,449
constellations

281
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,828
The car, you know, part of Ursa Major.

282
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,496
The Bear.

283
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,500
In their language, the car...

284
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,252
It is known as the "plow."

285
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,254
The cart.

286
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,840
That seems like a constellation.

287
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,467
The Egyptians called the eternal rocks.

288
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:37,430
They feared that the constellation
disappeared in the night sky.

289
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,307
And that symbolized eternity.

290
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:44,228
And these letters, "AMAMPMD".

291
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,315
Supports for the first seven stars.

292
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,151
The key is the order of star formation.

293
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,019
What the hell was that?

294
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,729
Seemed fireworks.

295
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,189
Seemed more shots.

296
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,091
I think our guys are under attack.

297
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,843
- Who attacked?
- I don't know.

298
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,344
I don't know.

299
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,012
Oh. Shit.

300
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:27,266
- They are coming, they were killed.
- What?

301
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,852
- Who comes?
- I have no idea.

302
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,104
- Who comes?
- Fuck that.

303
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:33,647
I'm here!

304
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,986
- What if you were arrested?
- You know, I could not tell you.

305
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,154
Come on, God!

306
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,874
A small detail, so...

307
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,083
How close the door?

308
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,419
Even though we did not discuss the matter.

309
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,879
- Get in there.
- Okay.

310
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,198
Now what?

311
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,700
Only hope.

312
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,370
While they can not enter,
we'll be fine.

313
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,455
I want to make a practical question.

314
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,708
What happens when you do not
get to the hotel tonight?

315
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,627
Not sent someone?

316
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,420
There was an official guide.

317
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,422
Nobody knows we're here.

318
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,133
Do not worry dear.

319
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,010
We'll be fine.

320
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,930
I was in a situation
There are similarly many years.

321
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,099
And emerges victorious.

322
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,809
Was in Sudan.

323
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,602
I was stuck for days.

324
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,982
Hey.

325
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,650
Okay?

326
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,406
I take that as a "yes"?

327
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,741
Maggie did not want to tell you...
"l told you."

328
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,243
So do not tell

329
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,620
Well, it's just a setback.

330
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,831
A setback is...

331
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,209
Waking up with a hangover,
20 minutes before a test.

332
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,461
This is crazy.

333
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,422
It's an adventure.

334
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,757
Imagine what this will be for
forever in our memories.

335
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,093
If you survive the time
enough to write.

336
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,762
Clueless, come on, we'll be fine.

337
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,556
I will, I promise.

338
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,099
Trust me.

339
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,769
Maggie, I trust in you.

340
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,565
He would not let anything bad
happen to us.

341
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,817
He would not, I know.

342
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,569
- I'm your daughter.
- Hey.

343
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,071
Best to come here.

344
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,118
Gone?

345
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,329
- How is he going to do?
- Look at that.

346
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,624
Went there without saying anything?

347
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,334
Should have prevented?

348
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,378
At a time when his father
was talking about...

349
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,130
Being stuck in a tomb.

350
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,507
And found a back door to exit.

351
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,344
And then he started talking
with Winchester in German.

352
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,387
Two seconds later.

353
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,473
This.

354
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,350
This guy is a gem.

355
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,269
He passed expeditions before we were born.

356
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,396
I'm sure he knows what he does.

357
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,148
I am afraid.

358
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,816
This is a way out then?

359
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,443
If so, he would have gone.

360
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,613
Probably just takes you to one
deepest place of the tomb.

361
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,031
Winchester.

362
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,449
<i>Teacher.</i>

363
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,910
We must go after them.

364
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,955
Yes... you are the daughter of his father.

365
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,498
I'll go with you.

366
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,834
Geri. Maybe better
if you stay here.

367
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,088
I've been on other expeditions,
you know.

368
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,048
I have a good idea what to do.

369
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,549
I'm sure, but...

370
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,385
We need someone to stay here.

371
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,594
With them.

372
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,513
More memories, right?

373
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,353
Winchester.

374
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,813
<i>Teacher.</i>

375
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,857
They must be joking.

376
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,068
They could disappear into thin air.

377
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:07,695
What's down there?

378
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,657
A narrow corridor.

379
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,994
Like your father did to pass around?

380
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,705
He knows how to pass through
of a tight spot.

381
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,374
It is determined, yes I admit.

382
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,042
That's it.

383
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,544
Let's go?

384
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,273
Hear that?

385
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,984
- What?
- It sounded like a growl.

386
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,070
- As a lion.
- Please.

387
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,405
Simply-

388
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,032
They were a long time already?

389
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,450
I have no idea.

390
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,952
They should not mind
I need something

391
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,579
To calm myself.

392
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,664
Where did you get the grass?

393
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,666
- In hotel.
- You can not smoke it here.

394
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,793
Sure, I have a recipe.

395
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:06,795
That means nothing in Egypt.

396
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,339
When you're in jail,
teach your recipe.

397
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,844
Do not worry,
I'll finish before returning.

398
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:19,099
Or you wanted some?

399
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,018
You?

400
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,270
She is already a paranoid hypochondriac.

401
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,855
Want to do worse?

402
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,857
- I'm not paranoid.
-No?

403
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,776
Just heard a growl.

404
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,402
Was right about the dust cloud.

405
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:33,572
Look, if I had listened,
we would not be stuck here.

406
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,826
Are you sure?
Can calm your nerves.

407
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,454
- No thanks.
- What a shame.

408
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,998
Works great for me.

409
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,460
As if you had any
reason to be nervous.

410
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,630
Hey, I do not have to
justify myself to you.

411
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,051
I had things that no girl should have.

412
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,179
Things to fuck your life.

413
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,474
June 14, 1995.

414
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,101
I will never forget.

415
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,311
Attacked a hospital in Chernobyl.

416
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,896
I was with my mother.

417
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:08,148
She was executed in front of me.

418
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,858
For the next two days.

419
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,778
I was locked in a room
with dead and dying.

420
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,656
I do not feel good inside.

421
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,741
This.

422
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,284
It helps me deal with it.

423
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,376
What?

424
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:28,669
Try a little?

425
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,504
Believe me, a little bit and...

426
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,297
I left completely relaxed.

427
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,050
Will help you forget all those sounds.

428
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,559
Let's go.

429
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,895
A city girl like you
never traveled before?

430
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,903
Father, my God.

431
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,572
I was very scared.

432
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,991
It is quiet, there is no
reason to be alarmed.

433
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,409
- We are well.
- What were they thinking?

434
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:02,619
I can not believe
you just go out like that.

435
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,788
We have enough problems?

436
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,081
Not a bit, dear.

437
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,042
We track the most fantastic discovery.

438
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,544
Let's go.

439
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,755
Look, Maggie.

440
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,717
Anankatep.

441
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,052
True High Priest and Guardian...

442
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,471
Unnamed.

443
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,557
Actually, I think.

444
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:24,933
Yes.

445
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,394
And the answer must be the secret here.

446
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,939
- This is amazing.
- Yes

447
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,547
Oh, my God.

448
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,284
Hello?

449
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,372
Hello?

450
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,423
Through the mutilation of
the body is secured...

451
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:41,009
As not to arouse the spirit world.

452
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:46,223
The remote location is to
prevent messengers from beyond.

453
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,184
According to legend, the
anonymous had no intention...

454
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,353
Go to the Kingdom of the Dead.

455
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,064
Instead, the wait here
grave for millennia.

456
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,316
Until the day that would be
risen again.

457
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:57,901
In the mortal world.

458
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:01,405
Teacher, and on the door that said Geri?

459
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,740
Yes, of course.

460
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:08,078
If this tomb was built as the others,
and I think it was.

461
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,831
Workers should be close to the camera.

462
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,916
Great, where do we find it?

463
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,334
- You hear that?
- What?

464
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,627
No!

465
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:39,795
Seemed a scream.

466
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,630
Kennedy seemed...

467
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,930
Geri?

468
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,433
Geri? I am here.

469
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,976
What happened?
Are you okay?

470
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,145
MY God, Maggie.

471
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,818
She is dead.

472
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,278
My God.

473
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,030
She is dead.

474
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,996
We're screwed.

475
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,832
I wish I could do something.

476
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,501
For starters, the fantasy
of father and daughter...

477
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,044
Get over it.

478
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,629
Now it's a nightmare.

479
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,381
That's not fair.

480
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,592
If not, why Kelly is dead.

481
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:30,971
It's not your fault, it was an accident.

482
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,099
Maggie, all are guilty.

483
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,685
All came here and we should not.

484
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,146
It's like he wanted to happen.

485
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,274
Nobody wanted the Titanic hit the iceberg,
but it happened.

486
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,986
Maggie, I do not know what kind of
control he has over you.

487
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,863
But you have to react.

488
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:52,033
From now on,
if he wants to go it alone, leave it.

489
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,618
We were in the group.

490
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,162
We leave it to us.

491
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,621
Okay!

492
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,293
I hope all is well back there.

493
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,420
Certainly.

494
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:08,258
Probably Miss Kennedy
wanted a little attention.

495
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,329
Maybe we should go see.

496
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,372
Whatever you want, dear.

497
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,710
I'll be more useful here.

498
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,877
What was that?

499
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:31,174
I think it is an incantation used to
the resurrection process.

500
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,885
Can you imagine that?

501
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:35,345
Right?

502
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,102
So...

503
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,603
What happened?

504
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,817
Ask her,
was she who drugged Kelly.

505
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,027
Why would grass to Egypt?

506
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,321
I did not bring, I picked up at the hotel.

507
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:56,074
This drove her crazy.

508
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,827
Hey, I also smoked and I did not freak.

509
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,580
Not everyone reacts the same way.

510
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,248
You know.

511
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:05,667
I'm telling Maggie was not the grass.

512
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,544
Nothing happened to me.

513
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,630
Something happened to her, it was clear.

514
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,424
The second was good.

515
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,134
And before he could move,

516
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,385
ran out of here.

517
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,346
We heard screams and...

518
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,724
Then everything fell apart.

519
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,894
Come on, let's find the rest.

520
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:27,814
True, we took our
things and go.

521
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:29,858
Wait, what do we do?

522
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,529
Kelly?

523
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,076
We'll have to leave it here.

524
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,287
Only until we can return
with the authorities.

525
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,788
And how do we do this?

526
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,374
There are guys with guns at the door.

527
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,877
Never leave here.

528
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:51,254
We will face them or we will die here.

529
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,964
Come on, do not say it.

530
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,466
I know you want to get out of here.

531
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,302
Heard my father, They've been
in situations like this before.

532
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,638
I know he knows how to get out.

533
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,265
Let's get our stuff and go.

534
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,023
Oh, great.

535
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:20,450
I really think we should go back.

536
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:32,045
Why do not we see where it leads?

537
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:36,383
- I don't know.
- And your sense of adventure?

538
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,595
Trust me, we'll find
is fascinating.

539
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:42,222
What about the rest?

540
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,765
Now we come.

541
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,309
There is only one place to go.

542
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,188
As you wish.

543
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:35,108
Maggie!

544
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:40,238
I can not believe,
is anyone there?

545
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,859
Just do not panic.

546
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:01,236
There must be another way.

547
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:02,695
There is always an opening somewhere else.

548
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:05,156
God, do not panic,
do not panic.

549
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,019
Fuck!

550
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:01,963
Thank God.

551
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,509
Ready, 9°-

552
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,410
Sara?, Father?

553
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,579
Professor Sara?

554
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,523
Sara?

555
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,493
Professor, what are you doing?

556
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,161
Are you okay?

557
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,486
Ronnie, are you okay?

558
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:50,279
Ronnie, talk to me.

559
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,991
- Ronnie?
- Maggie, thank God it's you.

560
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,952
Ronnie, my God, you scared us.

561
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,497
You find here and we think
you were having seizures.

562
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,165
Do not know what to do.

563
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,835
Sorry, do not know what happened.

564
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,045
It is as if I had passed out.

565
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:09,549
Nonsense, you have nothing
to apologize for.

566
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,718
Fortunately, you're fine.

567
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,386
All that matters.

568
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:17,390
Must remain hydrated
with so much stress.

569
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,059
Here.

570
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,062
Drink water. All we drink.

571
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,356
Hey...

572
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,108
Slowly.

573
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,068
We do not want you drown.

574
00:50:31,112 --> 00:50:32,697
Best?

575
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,949
Yes.

576
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,537
I had never been so
scared in my life.

577
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:43,374
Alright now, you're with us.

578
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,755
Where is Sara and her father?

579
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,757
I do not know, they were not here.

580
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,426
Why can not sit still?

581
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,721
This is something that I wondered
all my life.

582
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,974
Ok, so...

583
00:51:00,183 --> 00:51:01,517
What's the plan now?

584
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,644
Keep looking.

585
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:06,272
And we find this mysterious secret exit.

586
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,274
Maybe there's a clue here.

587
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:12,487
When you find them, we have to leave.

588
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,864
We should not go to
actual burial chamber.

589
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,867
- Of course.
- I'll take your word...

590
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:20,661
I do not think your
father has the same goal.

591
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,705
- Of course.
- Seriously?

592
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,098
Oh no!

593
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,315
Oh, come on!

594
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:08,829
Maggie has problems,
there must be something in the air as...

595
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:10,748
A microbacteria.

596
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,124
And the more we are...

597
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,460
Exposed, more likely to end...

598
00:54:16,254 --> 00:54:17,797
Dying.

599
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:27,783
Hello?

600
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,536
Professor?

601
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,790
Hello?

602
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,584
Professor?

603
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,380
Santa?

604
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:05,923
Now what?

605
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:08,217
- We take one of these passages.
- Father?

606
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:10,052
- Just relax.
- Hey.

607
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:11,846
- We parted?
- No.

608
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:13,973
We must stick together.

609
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:22,022
Come on, it's okay.
We will.

610
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,311
Hey.

611
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,021
What are you doing?

612
00:58:02,855 --> 00:58:04,315
I don't know.

613
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,319
I can not go there.

614
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,696
Nothing will happen, you should only
is therefore dragging

615
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:12,239
turns into a large tunnel.

616
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:14,658
Come on, Maggie is ahead.

617
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:17,244
I'll help it go, alright.

618
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,901
Shit, there is no escape.

619
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:55,699
Wait...

620
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,284
Feel that?

621
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:01,789
The fresh air.

622
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:51,589
My God, we did it.

623
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:52,840
We could.

624
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,134
Oh, my God!

625
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:02,891
Now we have to seek help.

626
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,768
Maybe we could go back to the village.

627
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,395
You go on without me.

628
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:08,606
- What?
- I gotta get back in there.

629
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,065
Trying to find my father.

630
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:13,193
Maggie, three of our
friends have died there.

631
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:15,404
- It is very dangerous.
- I have to find it.

632
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,072
Not. Maggie, please.

633
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,741
You do not think clearly.

634
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,285
Yes, I think.

635
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:23,954
Ronnie, you can not control
all situations.

636
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:25,706
This has nothing to do with control.

637
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:27,124
It is common sense.

638
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,960
Not Ronnie, control is all about you.

639
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:32,129
You control everything and everybody.

640
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:33,922
Simply-

641
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:37,217
Remember, in Washington,
when everyone left our project?

642
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:39,303
It was not because it was too difficult.

643
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:40,804
Was it because you were.

644
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:43,265
Ronnie.

645
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:44,767
You're my best friend.

646
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,352
I love you like a sister.

647
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,687
You know I'd do anything for you.

648
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:50,314
But sometimes...

649
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,940
You need to let go.

650
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,700
I'm sorry, but...

651
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:04,870
I'm staying here, there is no
way to go again

652
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:26,767
Maggie.

653
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,099
Ronnie, where are you?

654
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:51,393
Ronnie?

655
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,061
Ronnie, are you okay?

656
01:02:53,604 --> 01:02:55,105
Down here.

657
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:56,940
Are you okay?

658
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:01,069
Yes, I think so.

659
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,697
Do not think I've broken anything.

660
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:05,824
Is there a way out?

661
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:11,789
No, I think not.

662
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,462
Oh, my God!

663
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,214
- Oh, my God!
- What?

664
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,633
It is a type of burial room.

665
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,763
Maggie, do not leave me here.

666
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,431
I do not want to die here.

667
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,475
You will not, I swear.

668
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,519
Wait a minute.

669
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,395
I'll find one for you.

670
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,155
Magnifico, right?

671
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:51,657
Father.

672
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,075
Oh, my God!

673
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:56,328
I can not believe it's you?

674
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,789
- Are you okay?
- Of course I do, dear.

675
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:00,999
I thought I would not see you.

676
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,501
Of course.

677
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:42,416
Maggie!

678
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,835
Maggie, back please.

679
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:46,503
Let's go.

680
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:50,257
See Maggie, the Nameless

681
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:53,927
Tara, daughter of the sun.

682
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:57,097
Monarch of the North and South.

683
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,141
Queen of Egypt.

684
01:07:17,284 --> 01:07:19,327
Maggie!

685
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,747
Maggie!

686
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,875
Maggie, please help me!

687
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,854
Maggie, help me!

688
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:47,022
Oh, my God!

689
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:49,441
Maggie!

690
01:07:50,192 --> 01:07:52,861
Help, help me!

691
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:24,810
My God, we're in trouble,
should go.

692
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,354
Silence, dear.

693
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:28,939
- Do not worry.
- Please.

694
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,234
Please, Ronnie is in danger,
we have to go.

695
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:34,903
Please, we're in trouble.

696
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:37,280
You have to help me now,
she will die.

697
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:28,456
Will you kill me?

698
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:47,893
Without you, none of this
would have been possible.

699
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,828
Now, my queen.

700
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:30,055
The Resurrected Mummy
