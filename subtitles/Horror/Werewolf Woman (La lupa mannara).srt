1
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,688
Turn around.

2
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,493
Okay, out.

3
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:02,969
Turn around.

4
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:14,939
Giorgia stays,
Samantha and her friend can go.

5
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,027
Strip.

6
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:36,211
Turn around, slowly.

7
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:52,894
She'll do fine.

8
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:02,070
Thank you, dear, you can go.

9
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:45,613
This is vacant and furnished.

10
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:49,117
It was remodeled recently...

11
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,039
...but costs double the other,
and two months more advance.

12
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:57,834
Condominium costs are triple.

13
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:03,339
Best you know now,
when trucks pass, the place rattles.

14
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:06,301
You should take the other.

15
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:30,992
I'll take this.

16
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,269
May I help you?

17
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:00,855
- Good morning.
- Hi, Matteo.

18
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:05,902
Hello. Need maid?

19
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,405
- Where are you from?
- Ukraine.

20
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:12,283
- We don't need anyone.
- Ah.

21
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,791
- If you hear anything...
- Stop now and then and we'll see.

22
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,836
Many thanks.

23
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,004
Thanks.

24
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:31,261
What can you do?

25
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:37,851
Everything:
Clean, cook, wash, doing...

26
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:41,855
- Doing ironing.
- Are you ill? Hungry?

27
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:45,316
No, just need work.

28
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,486
- If you help me, I'll give 20%.
- Who do you take me for?

29
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:51,948
Better, 30, alright?
I'll give you 30%.

30
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,410
What people these days!

31
00:04:58,329 --> 00:04:59,456
Madame?

32
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:03,168
Come back through again.

33
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,260
- Sorry.
- Here you are.

34
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,600
Really love strawberries!

35
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:21,644
- A document, please.
- Yes.

36
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:26,775
- Give me your bag.
- Here.

37
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:30,236
- Irena Yaru...
- Yaroshenko, Irena Yaroshenko.

38
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:33,782
- This is okay.
- We're sorry, but we must...

39
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:48,380
What's this?

40
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,178
My savings.

41
00:05:57,555 --> 00:06:01,851
- It goes off, don't know what to do.
- Must be broken.

42
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:04,104
Our apologies, Madame,
this can happen.

43
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,431
Nello, where are you going?

44
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,604
Are you thirsty?

45
00:07:38,323 --> 00:07:41,659
I know you need a job,
if you're interested I'm leaving.

46
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:45,372
- Thanks, but I found one.
- Great!

47
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:48,708
- I can see for a friend.
- If you want.

48
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,462
- I just got my degree, I'll work
in a lawyer's office. - Congratulations!

49
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:55,215
You're lucky,
all jewelers here in Velarchi

50
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:57,926
don't usually take foreigners
into their homes.

51
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:02,097
Gina, would you do it
for that trifle?

52
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:05,975
Never! Besides
that stairway's a pigsty.

53
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:08,728
Okay, I get you!

54
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:11,499
Excellent job!

55
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,294
- When do I come?
- Tuesdays and Saturdays.

56
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:18,673
30 euros a day, 60 a week.

57
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:24,345
- So I give you 40 a week.
- Alright.

58
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:28,349
- What deposit to open the account?
- 8,000.

59
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,102
I heard you're looking for work.

60
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:33,980
My mother needs help.
Are you interested?

61
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:36,107
I have full week.

62
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:40,195
- I can see for a friend.
- Thank you.

63
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:50,622
Did you polish
the fourth floor doors and name plates?

64
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,624
I shouldn't?

65
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,793
It wasn't your job.

66
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,546
But since you work miracles,
you're forgiven.

67
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:02,842
Thank you and if you need me...

68
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:08,973
- Gina, Tea's out of vitamins.
- I know, I'll get some.

69
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:17,315
- Have a good day.
- Bye, Madame.

70
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:20,402
Stairs, stairs, stairs...

71
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:24,280
- The elevator works.
- Makes me feel panicky.

72
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:27,325
I can't breathe,
so stairs, stairs...

73
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,494
I live on staircases!

74
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,871
There's another small job.

75
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:35,834
An apartment's been painted,
needs cleaning, organizing.

76
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:38,128
- Where?
- Third floor, apt. 6.

77
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:43,675
- How much should I ask?
- More you ask, the better for us both.

78
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:47,887
Alright, so we'll see you on Monday.

79
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,141
Listen...

80
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:56,271
- Have a good meal.
- Thanks.

81
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:42,859
I can't stand her silence!

82
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:46,321
Only talks to her daughter,
she's a grouch with others.

83
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,907
How can she never talk?

84
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,369
- Must have problems.
- No shortage there.

85
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:56,831
- What does Mr. Donato do?
- They have a jeweler's lab.

86
00:11:57,082 --> 00:12:02,170
He's director, she designs and engraves.
She's good, but no company.

87
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:05,715
If you like, we could go out.

88
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:10,136
I'm free only
Thursday afternoons and Sundays.

89
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:15,934
Why not?
Although I know nothing about you...

90
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:13,241
What's all that ruckus?

91
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:14,409
It's Valeria.

92
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:18,329
- Why not work in the outside lab?
- She's separated.

93
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:22,208
Not all who separate
set up labs in their homes!

94
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,003
Before too, what fighting!

95
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:28,256
There was peace only
when they went to the country.

96
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:31,176
She did her whole pregnancy there.

97
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,192
Hello?

98
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:52,947
Yeah... Me too...

99
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:59,120
I can't talk right now.
Can I call you back?

100
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,665
Talk to you later.

101
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,076
Stop, thief!

102
00:14:42,497 --> 00:14:44,457
Stop, thief!

103
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,252
Thief!

104
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:11,443
Be right back.

105
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,298
37!

106
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:50,231
39!

107
00:15:50,273 --> 00:15:51,733
May I help you?

108
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,697
40!

109
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:02,952
41!

110
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:06,706
- Actually I said 8 mm.
- 42!

111
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,378
- 42! Where's 42?
- Me!

112
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:15,757
- Duplicates of all three
plus the remote. - Alright.

113
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:18,885
Make a copy of everything.

114
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:27,352
- Something wrong?
- No.

115
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:29,062
Meantime, can I pay?

116
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:35,610
- 60 euros...
- That man's first. - Sorry.

117
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:39,864
There.

118
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:44,160
- The short one is out.
I don't have this one. - Are you sure?

119
00:16:44,202 --> 00:16:46,496
It's been ordered.

120
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,249
You'll get me fired.

121
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,211
Wait, maybe there's a way.

122
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:58,591
- Feeling ill?
- I'm better now.

123
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,853
I don't like
going to the movies alone.

124
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:13,773
- Why not go with the girl?
- She wants just cartoons!

125
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:16,151
Maybe she's too young.

126
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:18,319
She'll be 4 on Sunday.

127
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:21,156
If I give her a savings account?

128
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:24,284
- Bank accounts earn nothing.
- No, that's not the purpose.

129
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:27,662
Every month
I'll deposit what I can set aside...

130
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:31,207
...so when she's 18
she'll have a nest egg.

131
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,084
- Like some?
- Yes.

132
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:35,170
She'll know best
how to make the most of it.

133
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:39,841
Sorry, what a mess!
I'm sorry!

134
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:42,302
Don't worry...

135
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:46,765
That's a future day.

136
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,934
She'll have a nice sum.

137
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,396
Sounds like a good gift.
She'll like it.

138
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,178
Won't breathe a word, I swear!

139
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,597
You'll end up bad, believe me!

140
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:14,310
It's 3 years now you've been looking
and looking... What for?

141
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:17,731
Questions right and left...
You're sick!

142
00:22:21,664 --> 00:22:22,999
Just look at that!

143
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:06,876
Madame, this is Matteo.
Nothing serious...

144
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:09,796
...you forgot to set the alarm.

145
00:23:10,004 --> 00:23:14,384
Yes, all's okay.
It gave me a scare!

146
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:18,346
Yes, I'll set it.

147
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:57,445
Can a real dream exist
among so many nightmares?

148
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:00,907
I'm real! Feel me?

149
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:04,327
It's me, Nello,
flesh, bones, skin, nerves.

150
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,708
Nightmares can be forgotten.

151
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:14,212
Trust me, I'll take you away
from all that mess.

152
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:16,423
Rasaniza.

153
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:17,674
What?

154
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:23,304
- Kra-sa-vi-ca!
- Krasavica.

155
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:30,228
Maybe someday
I can forget my nightmares.

156
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:35,066
They're mine, it's easier,
but you?

157
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,611
Meaning? Talk plain.

158
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:40,739
Not enough money.

159
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,491
Now that I finished apt. 6,
you have to help me.

160
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,118
Be patient.

161
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:48,705
- Hello.
- Hi, Matteo.

162
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:52,459
How many jewelers
work in their homes here?

163
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,378
Except the third floor, all of them.

164
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:01,009
Don't they need someone to help
around the house...

165
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,928
...or substitute old housekeepers?

166
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,932
It's not easy
and for a foreigner it's even worse.

167
00:26:07,974 --> 00:26:11,227
They all have trusted help.

168
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:13,313
- Morning!
- Morning!

169
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:20,695
Your friend Gina's been there forever,
she'll never be sent away.

170
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,825
Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs...

171
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,536
Hello, Gina!
How did the party go?

172
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:30,663
Well, just like
every child's birthday:

173
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:33,750
...the more kids have fun,
the more adults think of old age.

174
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,251
Did she like the gift?

175
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:40,131
- Her mother was astonished.
- And the girl?

176
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:42,967
She didn't understand it.

177
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:45,470
Taken with her new toys...

178
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:48,848
But no matter,
one day she'll realize.

179
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,852
- She got another bump on the head.
- What?

180
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:57,982
She has a rare disease
inhibiting her defense mechanisms.

181
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,610
She's always bruised.

182
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:04,364
If something falls on her,
she doesn't protect herself.

183
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:08,243
If she falls,
she doesn't stop herself.

184
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:12,288
- There must be some cure.
- Doctors say there isn't.

185
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:17,293
She just has to be careful.
There's worse.

186
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:22,173
- I have to go now.
- See you later. - Bye.

187
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,410
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

188
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,848
Yes, she'll do fine.

189
00:28:54,474 --> 00:28:55,934
You're Irena?

190
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,311
Yes.

191
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:01,189
- Sojourner's permit?
- All in order.

192
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:10,490
- 32... Are you married, children?
- Married, no children.

193
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:13,660
- Your husband?
- He works in Ukraine.

194
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:19,082
- Can you cook?
- Yes.

195
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:21,334
What, for example?

196
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:26,381
Cutlets, pasta with pesto,
spaghetti Bottarga style...

197
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:29,634
...fruit pies of all kinds.
- How strange.

198
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:34,097
- Don't you like pies?
- No, the contrary!

199
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:38,935
- Do you have experience
with small children? - Yes.

200
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:43,648
- Have you taken care of them often?
- Very often.

201
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,778
You sound perfect!

202
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:53,992
Gina and the porter
have spoken very highly of you.

203
00:29:54,784 --> 00:29:58,329
Let's do a trial period,
then we'll see.

204
00:29:58,413 --> 00:30:01,958
- When do you want me to start?
- Is Monday alright?

205
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,335
Perfect, thank you.

206
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,464
- Ah! One very important thing!
- Yes.

207
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:10,884
- Can you drive?
- Absolutely!

208
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,305
- Is this okay?
- Better.

209
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:19,350
- Now into second.
- Yes.

210
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:24,481
- Did we have to come here?
- Not a soul yesterday.

211
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:26,066
Turn at the roundabout.

212
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:28,485
Just go away!

213
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:35,450
Careful! Want an accident?

214
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:53,968
I like you! You and me
will do great things together.

215
00:30:54,677 --> 00:30:56,763
So I want a stage name for you.

216
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,141
Something special.

217
00:31:01,684 --> 00:31:02,977
Giorgia.

218
00:31:03,937 --> 00:31:05,689
Giorgia,
like the song.

219
00:31:05,814 --> 00:31:09,234
#Giorgia, Giorgia. #

220
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:14,030
Like it?

221
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,912
Untie me, even just one hand,
and I'll answer.

222
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,998
You've got great eyes.

223
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:30,630
Hello?

224
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,260
Hello?
Who is it? Hello?

225
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:54,988
This is the laundry room.
Sorry for the mess...

226
00:31:55,155 --> 00:31:58,867
The washer leaks when it spin-dries.

227
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:01,161
I have to get it fixed.

228
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:02,829
There's a small problem
with the hood.

229
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:06,666
When you turn it on from here,
you have to hit it or it won't start.

230
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:08,918
- Where do I turn off the gas?
- Oh, yeah, sure...

231
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,003
For the first weeks...

232
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:13,548
...can you work on Thursdays too?
- Of course.

233
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,302
Do I change the sheets here
every week too?

234
00:32:17,427 --> 00:32:21,056
No, this was Gina's room,
no one sleeps there now.

235
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:24,684
I work here.

236
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:28,480
For no reason whatever
you set foot in here...

237
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:30,482
...or touch anything in my absence.

238
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:34,861
- Even to wash the floor?
- Nothing at all. - Fine.

239
00:32:39,115 --> 00:32:40,241
Slowly!

240
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:41,993
It's nothing, sweetie.

241
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:45,038
- You're bad!
- It wasn't on purpose. - I'm sorry.

242
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,165
It's nothing, sweetheart.

243
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:50,335
I didn't see her...

244
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:54,547
I never want to see her again,
dumbbell!

245
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:58,635
You got knocked up!
I told you to be careful.

246
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,844
You're all the same!

247
00:32:59,886 --> 00:33:04,015
You said to excite him
even without...

248
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:07,227
You dirtied my shirt,
you'll pay for it!

249
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,187
The tangler does the untangling.

250
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:26,454
- Madame, excuse me.
- Come in.

251
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:30,458
The collar of this blouse
is ruined, what do I do?

252
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:36,631
What can you do? Throw it out.
Too bad, it looked nice on me.

253
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,342
I can turn it around.

254
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:43,888
- You can do that too?
- It's not hard.

255
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,724
- Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:48,560
Wait, let me finish
the link on this bracelet.

257
00:33:48,685 --> 00:33:50,395
Irena, the new maid.

258
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,773
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening. Alright.

259
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:55,775
Daddy! Daddy!

260
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:04,325
- Did you bring me the castle?
- Forgive me, I forgot.

261
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:12,459
- Leave the room, please,
go to the child. - Immediately.

262
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:32,187
Tea, want a snack?

263
00:34:34,564 --> 00:34:35,815
Tea?

264
00:34:40,362 --> 00:34:42,489
I want to know why!

265
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,366
That's no way to talk!

266
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:46,368
It is!
I don't recognize anything here!

267
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:47,577
Lower your voice!

268
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,121
What, lower my voice? Whore!

269
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:52,540
- How dare you?
- How dare I?

270
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:55,335
I know you've got
your own friggin' stuff.

271
00:34:55,377 --> 00:34:57,796
Oh, just stop it, please!

272
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,431
Hi, Tea!

273
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,479
Are you sorry to see me?
Mommy couldn't come.

274
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,981
Let's go.

275
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:26,616
You're right, I was a dumbbell.
How can I set things right?

276
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:35,750
- You tricked my mother.
- How?

277
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:39,754
You can't drive, I'll tell her.

278
00:35:41,297 --> 00:35:43,925
Good, so you'll be rid of me...

279
00:35:44,884 --> 00:35:47,887
...but it's not my fault
you don't know how to fall.

280
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:54,019
I'll tell her you peek
when she argues with your father...

281
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:55,979
...then you hide and cry.

282
00:35:58,148 --> 00:36:01,484
- Hi, Mommy!
- Hello, sweetheart!

283
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,698
How are you?
How did it go?

284
00:36:08,742 --> 00:36:10,285
- Fine.
- Good girl!

285
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:12,787
Now go with Irena...

286
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:17,751
...I'm doing urgent work.
See you later.

287
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:24,132
- Go look in your room.
- Why? - Go!

288
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:31,139
Wow! The princess castle!

289
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:37,354
- Thank you.
- Your father brought it.

290
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:40,982
Did you call Daddy?

291
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:44,110
Sure, I'm not like you
who never calls him.

292
00:36:46,863 --> 00:36:48,365
Irena, the spin-dry!

293
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:52,702
- So now you can dial Daddy's number!
Good girl! - Yes.

294
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:14,474
Do you fancy going to the pool
for the swimming lessons?

295
00:37:14,557 --> 00:37:16,267
Yeah, but I'd rather...

296
00:37:43,753 --> 00:37:45,338
Hello?

297
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:01,896
One rag's not enough!

298
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,567
- Alright, it's all in order.
- Or there'll be a lake.

299
00:38:25,545 --> 00:38:27,130
Did you get the pail?

300
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:32,302
- Did much water leak?
- None.

301
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,890
- Is this a miracle?
- I changed the rubber...

302
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:41,102
You're fantastic,
the end of a nightmare!

303
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:46,858
If that's all, I'll clean up
the kitchen and leave.

304
00:38:46,983 --> 00:38:48,526
No, wait.

305
00:38:49,152 --> 00:38:51,654
Your relationship
with Tea is better now.

306
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,116
Could you stay with her
until around midnight?

307
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,661
- Please go, I have no schedule.
- Good.

308
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:08,797
I know it was you.

309
00:39:11,174 --> 00:39:13,134
- What?
- The present.

310
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,098
Why didn't you tell me?

311
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:23,311
I thought you'd be happier
to think it was from your father.

312
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:42,414
You changed hair color
three times...

313
00:39:42,872 --> 00:39:48,002
...black when you were born,
then red and, at one year, brown.

314
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:57,011
Your eyes, black, green, brown!
My goodness!

315
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:00,140
Know any lullabies?

316
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:05,770
- Lullabies... Yes, one.
- Sing it to me!

317
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:37,964
- You even organized the store room!
- I emptied it because it was flooded.

318
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:41,384
- It's all to throw out.
- Not my things!

319
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:43,219
Remember these?

320
00:42:47,724 --> 00:42:50,143
- It's beautiful!
- It's unrecognizable.

321
00:42:50,185 --> 00:42:51,394
How fantastic!

322
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,813
How did you do it in three days?
It's perfect!

323
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:01,029
Irena, the towels!

324
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:04,115
I washed everything,
there was no time.

325
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:07,160
It's chilly! Thanks.

326
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:08,828
My compliments, Madame.

327
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,122
May I say,
you have a young girl's body.

328
00:43:11,164 --> 00:43:13,166
That's foolishness!

329
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:19,005
- Donato, you'll make her fall.
- Yes sir, Colonel!

330
00:43:23,343 --> 00:43:26,471
I'm happy you and your husband...

331
00:43:26,888 --> 00:43:29,265
Even Tea is much more relaxed.

332
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,936
Rub some cream on my back, please.

333
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,438
Thanks.

334
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:39,943
We're silly, I formalize with you
and you with me...

335
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,362
Why don't we simply stop it?

336
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,197
As you wish, Madame.

337
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:51,121
That wasn't a compliment earlier,
you do have a nice body.

338
00:43:51,871 --> 00:43:54,582
Doesn't seem you've ever had a baby.

339
00:43:58,628 --> 00:43:59,879
Tea, careful!

340
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,216
- Don't run like that!
- Don't terrorize her.

341
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,093
If she falls, she'll get up!

342
00:44:05,135 --> 00:44:07,887
We're keeping her
from always getting hurt.

343
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:09,305
Leave her free to move.

344
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:11,850
Isn't there a cure?

345
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:14,644
She's not ill,
get it in your heads!

346
00:44:18,398 --> 00:44:19,524
Tea...

347
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:22,819
Irena, what's your husband like?

348
00:44:24,571 --> 00:44:26,781
- My husband?
- You never talk about him.

349
00:44:46,134 --> 00:44:48,011
Daddy! Hi!

350
00:44:48,094 --> 00:44:50,472
Drop me at the bus stop.

351
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:53,099
- We'll take you home.
- Don't bother.

352
00:44:53,266 --> 00:44:55,101
So we can see where you live.

353
00:44:55,268 --> 00:44:57,228
Another time, I'll just walk.

354
00:44:58,146 --> 00:44:59,397
Bye-bye!

355
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:21,795
Oh, come on!

356
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:26,800
Irena, wait!

357
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:31,221
I'll come with you,
so we can talk.

358
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,265
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing.

359
00:45:34,974 --> 00:45:38,436
It was really tough
convincing them to take you...

360
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,773
...many had better requisites.

361
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:44,359
I see, our deal's no good anymore?

362
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:49,906
No, I just thought
you might be a little nicer to me.

363
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:54,577
Let me help you.
Live around here?

364
00:45:55,495 --> 00:45:57,205
Listen, Matteo:

365
00:45:57,414 --> 00:46:02,001
...as of today I'll give you
50% of my salary. Alright?

366
00:46:03,002 --> 00:46:05,922
But stay away from me.
Thanks.

367
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,046
I have something important to ask.

368
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:34,219
Are you up to staying
a week alone with Tea?

369
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:42,936
Before Christmas
I need some time alone.

370
00:47:42,977 --> 00:47:46,439
- You owe me no explanations, alright.
- Good.

371
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,484
You'll have special payment,
of course.

372
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:51,611
I'll leave you an amount
for the food shopping.

373
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:54,364
For any other needs
call Mr. Donato at the lab.

374
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:56,574
- Alright.
- Wait a moment. - Yes.

375
00:47:56,616 --> 00:48:01,913
- You can call me at any time.
- It'll be fine.

376
00:48:02,664 --> 00:48:06,584
I'm worried about Tea,
never let her out of your sight.

377
00:48:06,626 --> 00:48:10,672
Maybe it's better if she doesn't go
to school. What do you think?

378
00:48:11,965 --> 00:48:14,968
I don't think so,
too many changes...

379
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:20,849
Is Friday the last day before vacation,
or Saturday? No, Friday.

380
00:48:21,307 --> 00:48:25,395
Don't tell her anything,
she'll ask too many questions.

381
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:30,275
- One last thing...
- Yes?

382
00:48:30,525 --> 00:48:32,694
It's been a long time
since I went to Villa Robinia.

383
00:48:32,902 --> 00:48:36,156
I'll do it, you try to be happy.

384
00:48:46,374 --> 00:48:48,376
- What did you do?
- Me? Nothing.

385
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:52,047
Here you are!
I didn't know where else to look.

386
00:48:52,088 --> 00:48:56,968
- I told you I would come to class
for her. - She ran off.

387
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:59,929
I understand that,
it's the rest I don't understand!

388
00:49:00,388 --> 00:49:03,224
They pushed me down the stairs.

389
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,937
If this happens again,
you'll be in serious trouble.

390
00:49:07,979 --> 00:49:10,357
- Still hurt?
- Yes.

391
00:49:12,108 --> 00:49:16,363
The next time you have to react,
beat them up.

392
00:49:16,696 --> 00:49:19,449
What about the story
of the cheek?

393
00:49:19,532 --> 00:49:22,994
If someone slaps you,
they can slap the other cheek too.

394
00:49:23,078 --> 00:49:25,872
That's what the ones
who start the fights say.

395
00:49:26,206 --> 00:49:30,585
You must defend yourself,
and protect yourself when you fall.

396
00:49:32,128 --> 00:49:33,296
How?

397
00:49:34,964 --> 00:49:39,135
- If you want to know, you must do
everything I say. - I accept.

398
00:49:39,886 --> 00:49:41,429
Let's shake.

399
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:46,226
We should celebrate.

400
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:51,189
- I bet you like strawberries.
- You win!

401
00:50:09,332 --> 00:50:10,583
I knew it.

402
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:15,296
The pediatrician says I can't eat them.
You won't tell my mother?

403
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:20,593
I'd betray our pact.
I keep secrets.

404
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,997
- Hurt you?
- No.

405
00:52:13,123 --> 00:52:17,168
- Is this the game of salami?
- Sort of.

406
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:23,842
Get up.

407
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:29,889
I'll help you.

408
00:52:31,474 --> 00:52:32,642
Good girl!

409
00:52:35,228 --> 00:52:36,604
Up you go!

410
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,356
Come on.

411
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:44,029
By yourself!

412
00:52:44,863 --> 00:52:46,823
Now alone.

413
00:52:48,742 --> 00:52:50,702
Come on, up!

414
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:54,164
Come on, Tea! Get up!

415
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,543
Good girl. Get up.

416
00:53:04,174 --> 00:53:06,634
- Good.
- I did it, now stop!

417
00:53:07,802 --> 00:53:10,555
Get up by yourself!

418
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:14,142
Up you go!

419
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:16,853
- You're bad!
- By yourself!

420
00:53:16,978 --> 00:53:18,229
Get up!

421
00:53:19,689 --> 00:53:24,736
Again! Get up!
Come on, get up!

422
00:53:25,695 --> 00:53:27,030
Come on, Tea! Come on!

423
00:53:27,113 --> 00:53:30,784
- I'll tell my mother, I'll get you fired.
- Will you get me fired?

424
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:32,702
- Who'll you get fired?
- You're horrible!

425
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:36,247
You're bad!

426
00:53:36,623 --> 00:53:38,666
- Again!
- You're bad!

427
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,668
Again! Again!

428
00:53:41,961 --> 00:53:46,466
- Get up! Get up!
- Stop, please!

429
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:47,675
- Again!
- Stop it!

430
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:53,306
Get up, come on!
Again! Get up!

431
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:55,850
Whore! Whore! Whore!

432
00:54:17,997 --> 00:54:21,626
Good girl!
See, you can do it?

433
00:54:21,751 --> 00:54:24,045
Why didn't you slap me before?

434
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:27,590
Why didn't you do it before?
You're good, understand?

435
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:35,598
Come with me.

436
00:54:38,435 --> 00:54:40,687
Tell Mrs. Adacher
she's one payment in arrears.

437
00:54:40,729 --> 00:54:42,814
- I've just paid.
- Oh, sorry.

438
00:54:43,356 --> 00:54:44,899
Here we are.

439
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,786
Here's the nicest guest
at Villa Robinia.

440
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:09,758
Gina, do you recognize me?

441
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:12,886
It's useless.
If it's not cold...

442
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:16,222
...she can go out for some air.
It'll do her good.

443
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:22,228
I'm sorry.
I know you'll never forgive me...

444
00:55:24,731 --> 00:55:29,110
...but if I didn't go my way
I'd have died myself.

445
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:32,655
Understand?

446
00:55:40,914 --> 00:55:43,625
I'll repay you somehow.

447
00:55:44,834 --> 00:55:48,505
That's small for a large branch,
put it higher.

448
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,673
Sure, Madame President.

449
00:55:51,466 --> 00:55:53,385
Put the star on top.

450
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:57,263
- Mr. Donato, staying for dinner?
- Well, Madame President?

451
00:55:57,472 --> 00:56:00,183
It won't hurt you
to spend an evening with me.

452
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:06,564
- Want to eat with us?
- I don't think so.

453
00:56:07,315 --> 00:56:10,527
- Daddy, you tell her too.
- Don't be a pest.

454
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:14,614
If I'm the president,
why do you always decide?

455
00:56:16,908 --> 00:56:18,702
Irena, please...

456
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:32,173
Who taught you to cook so well?

457
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:37,262
No one, I've read lots of recipes.

458
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:55,321
- I'm still hungry!
- He's hungry!

459
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:18,345
- Now I need 3 kids!
- Me, me!

460
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:21,097
You, you and you!

461
00:57:21,222 --> 00:57:24,100
- No, Tea!
- Let her go.

462
00:57:24,142 --> 00:57:28,646
Let's help him digest, jump!

463
00:57:53,088 --> 00:57:55,006
What a stink!

464
00:58:10,438 --> 00:58:12,732
Mommy!

465
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:23,910
Get up.

466
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:46,808
Get up.

467
00:58:52,355 --> 00:58:53,690
Up!

468
00:58:58,528 --> 00:59:00,822
It's useless, leave me alone.

469
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:10,832
- Slap me, punch me!
- Please, stop!

470
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:19,507
I'll do everything,
but I want to go out.

471
00:59:20,216 --> 00:59:22,218
I can never do it.

472
00:59:40,111 --> 00:59:41,821
It's ages since he worked.

473
00:59:41,863 --> 00:59:45,492
- Didn't even get his money.
- Where can I look?

474
00:59:47,202 --> 00:59:48,620
Who knows?

475
01:00:00,298 --> 01:00:03,843
A picture with Santa Claus?
Come on!

476
01:00:04,094 --> 01:00:07,514
Smile.
Get closerto Mommy.

477
01:00:07,847 --> 01:00:11,309
- But really she's...
- What is it? - Nothing.

478
01:00:11,393 --> 01:00:13,812
- Keep still...
- Smile...

479
01:00:13,853 --> 01:00:15,897
A nice smile... Done!

480
01:00:16,606 --> 01:00:18,066
Hi, sweetie!

481
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:23,488
How are you?
You're so elegant!

482
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:27,033
- Merry Christmas, Madame.
- Thanks, Matteo. - Goodbye.

483
01:00:27,117 --> 01:00:28,493
Let me see you.

484
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:34,290
- What's this here?
- Nothing.

485
01:00:34,374 --> 01:00:36,584
- What did you do to your arm?
- Nothing.

486
01:00:36,668 --> 01:00:38,253
Irena, what happened?

487
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,381
It was the rope on the swings...

488
01:00:41,506 --> 01:00:44,300
...you know me.
- Yes, honey.

489
01:00:47,846 --> 01:00:51,725
- What do I fix?
- I forgot, we're dining out.

490
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:55,687
Thanks, Irena. If you're done,
you can go, we'll talk tomorrow.

491
01:00:56,021 --> 01:00:59,232
- Alright. Have a good evening.
- Thanks.

492
01:00:59,315 --> 01:01:02,652
- Who'll you eat with tonight?
- With friends.

493
01:01:03,069 --> 01:01:07,365
Why don't you ever let me
meet your friends?

494
01:01:08,491 --> 01:01:10,410
I don't think you'd have any fun.

495
01:01:10,618 --> 01:01:14,914
- See you tomorrow?
- Why shouldn't we?

496
01:01:16,082 --> 01:01:18,376
Everything is back the way it was.

497
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:36,895
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

498
01:01:36,936 --> 01:01:37,979
Merry Christmas!

499
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:14,474
Who is it?

500
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:19,104
Holy Christ! What happened to you?

501
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:24,526
Come inside.

502
01:02:25,402 --> 01:02:27,904
You won't go to the hospital,
or the police...

503
01:02:28,613 --> 01:02:29,656
Sorry.

504
01:02:29,948 --> 01:02:32,659
You've got yourself
into some dirty business.

505
01:02:32,992 --> 01:02:36,204
Let me stay here a few days.

506
01:02:36,913 --> 01:02:41,459
- Want to get me in trouble too?
- Only if you don't help me.

507
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:46,756
I'm sorry,
before daylight you're gone.

508
01:02:47,382 --> 01:02:48,925
And forever, hear me?

509
01:02:49,134 --> 01:02:53,471
First though, I want to say goodbye
to all the tenants.

510
01:02:53,888 --> 01:02:56,057
Just so you get out.

511
01:02:56,224 --> 01:02:59,102
So I can tell them
the tale of the dust of gold.

512
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,692
What are you?

513
01:03:07,777 --> 01:03:09,195
They should've beaten you harder!

514
01:03:22,876 --> 01:03:24,335
Come on in.

515
01:03:24,419 --> 01:03:28,423
- Like it?
- Day and night in here?

516
01:03:29,424 --> 01:03:31,176
Honey, it's for your own good.

517
01:03:31,217 --> 01:03:33,887
Lucrezia will see you get fresh air.

518
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,472
Italian cooking.

519
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,183
- Here.
- For me? - Mh.

520
01:03:39,684 --> 01:03:44,272
- How did you know I love red ones?
- I watch you, study you.

521
01:03:44,481 --> 01:03:47,108
Sometimes I have a heavy hand...

522
01:03:47,942 --> 01:03:49,611
...but you're special to me.

523
01:03:50,153 --> 01:03:53,782
You have to do me a favor,
I've got a few friends...

524
01:03:54,115 --> 01:03:56,493
- But I...
- They're a little peculiar.

525
01:03:56,618 --> 01:04:00,288
Then absolute rest,
right to the last week.

526
01:04:00,497 --> 01:04:02,457
Who's first?

527
01:04:10,715 --> 01:04:16,471
I brought you the medicine...
and some chocolate.

528
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,015
Tell Mrs. Adacher...

529
01:04:19,057 --> 01:04:22,394
...that I have the flu
and I can't work for a while.

530
01:04:22,477 --> 01:04:23,520
Alright.

531
01:04:35,448 --> 01:04:37,117
Merry Christmas!

532
01:04:39,452 --> 01:04:40,578
Merry Christmas!

533
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,288
Hurry!

534
01:05:07,188 --> 01:05:10,316
- Not even once?
- No, I always aborted.

535
01:05:11,234 --> 01:05:14,070
You mustn't care much for yourself.

536
01:05:15,655 --> 01:05:17,323
Too bad, at your age...

537
01:05:18,908 --> 01:05:23,371
- What do you mean?
- You can no longer have children.

538
01:05:42,307 --> 01:05:43,933
Excuse me.
Does this go to Velarchi?

539
01:05:43,975 --> 01:05:46,269
- Yes, Madame.
- Good.

540
01:05:58,948 --> 01:06:02,577
All I know is you have to be careful,
there are too many rumors.

541
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:06,289
The men aren't having fun anymore,
they say you always cry.

542
01:06:06,331 --> 01:06:09,793
The winds have changed, Giorgia,
cover your back.

543
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,963
"Mold" is kind and sweet,
but when he doesn't need you...

544
01:06:14,047 --> 01:06:16,591
What more could he do?
Get rid of me?

545
01:06:16,675 --> 01:06:18,885
We each make of our lives
what we choose.

546
01:06:18,927 --> 01:06:23,223
Don't deny the condemned a last wish.
Give me that name.

547
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:38,780
It's me, it wouldn't open.

548
01:06:41,032 --> 01:06:42,867
She's been looking for you all day.

549
01:06:43,284 --> 01:06:45,870
- Need any help?
- No, thanks. - Do you need any doctor?

550
01:06:45,995 --> 01:06:49,207
- How's Tea? - You won't believe it,
but she has a fever too.

551
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:51,626
She's here, I'll put her on.

552
01:06:53,294 --> 01:06:56,840
- Hi.
- What an awful voice!

553
01:06:57,173 --> 01:07:01,970
- See, I'm sick like you?
When are you coming back? - Soon.

554
01:07:03,555 --> 01:07:08,435
- Why don't you come now? Bundle up.
- I can't, honey.

555
01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:14,357
Sing me that song
that I can't understand...

556
01:07:15,066 --> 01:07:18,194
...but that makes me sleep so much.
- Alright.

557
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:21,322
- Are you under the covers?
- Yes.

558
01:08:56,418 --> 01:08:59,504
- You're happy this evening.
- Happens.

559
01:08:59,921 --> 01:09:02,757
Two guys came asking for you today.

560
01:09:04,009 --> 01:09:07,137
- I said you don't work here anymore.
- Good.

561
01:09:07,721 --> 01:09:08,805
There's another thing.

562
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,516
The family is looking for a new maid.

563
01:09:12,183 --> 01:09:14,561
You should cut out.

564
01:09:15,812 --> 01:09:17,480
I've warned you.

565
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:24,738
I feel I'm in a place
where you walk and walk...

566
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:30,035
...but you're always in the same spot.
You can't find the exit, if there is one.

567
01:09:31,786 --> 01:09:33,997
Every step you take is a mistake.

568
01:09:36,499 --> 01:09:38,793
I've made lots of mistakes...

569
01:09:39,127 --> 01:09:41,838
...a lifetime isn't long enough
to pay for them all.

570
01:09:43,089 --> 01:09:46,968
But believing that someone like me...

571
01:09:47,052 --> 01:09:53,516
...could still have a future
was my biggest mistake.

572
01:09:56,353 --> 01:10:00,607
That's the reason I should die,
not for that animal.

573
01:11:17,392 --> 01:11:19,060
This is for Nello.

574
01:11:47,505 --> 01:11:51,009
I'd do it again, I have no remorse,
just fear...

575
01:11:51,134 --> 01:11:54,679
...because I thought
I'd settled accounts with my past.

576
01:11:55,847 --> 01:11:59,184
But I guess the past
hasn't settled accounts with me.

577
01:12:02,103 --> 01:12:04,481
I've tired you enough for today.

578
01:12:31,007 --> 01:12:32,467
Thank you, bye.

579
01:12:35,303 --> 01:12:36,554
Irena!

580
01:12:37,389 --> 01:12:38,640
Hello.

581
01:12:41,351 --> 01:12:43,812
- I see you're healed.
- I'm better.

582
01:12:43,853 --> 01:12:47,941
This morning's my first time out,
I'd have called this afternoon.

583
01:12:50,568 --> 01:12:52,028
How are you?

584
01:12:52,946 --> 01:12:55,240
What did you do to your face?

585
01:12:56,324 --> 01:12:58,785
Thinking so much about you,
I fell too.

586
01:13:06,126 --> 01:13:09,879
- Have you found a new maid?
- What are your intentions?

587
01:13:14,217 --> 01:13:17,971
- There have been some robberies
in the condominium. - Really?

588
01:13:18,596 --> 01:13:21,725
It would be best
if you give me back the keys.

589
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:26,604
- It's for your own good.
- Of course!

590
01:13:27,689 --> 01:13:30,817
- I'm always home, I'll open to you.
- Sure.

591
01:13:37,866 --> 01:13:41,202
Want something to drink?

592
01:13:42,662 --> 01:13:45,498
Kids, Tea, are you thirsty?

593
01:13:48,001 --> 01:13:50,420
I got you a new cartoon.

594
01:13:53,757 --> 01:13:56,384
Can't you see we're playing?
Leave us alone!

595
01:14:13,985 --> 01:14:16,780
Why do you treat me so badly?

596
01:14:17,405 --> 01:14:19,616
Teach me hide-and-seek.

597
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:24,704
1, 2, 3...

598
01:14:25,121 --> 01:14:28,249
...4, 5, 6...

599
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:33,421
...7, 8, 9, 10!

600
01:14:36,966 --> 01:14:38,551
Where are you hiding?

601
01:14:40,512 --> 01:14:42,722
Where's Tea?

602
01:15:07,997 --> 01:15:09,582
Tea, come out!

603
01:15:13,044 --> 01:15:14,379
Tea!

604
01:15:17,424 --> 01:15:18,466
Tea!

605
01:15:20,135 --> 01:15:21,469
Tea!

606
01:15:39,863 --> 01:15:42,574
What happened? What's wrong?
Calm down!

607
01:15:43,575 --> 01:15:44,617
What's wrong?

608
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,911
What happened?

609
01:15:48,288 --> 01:15:50,165
They've kidnapped the child.

610
01:15:50,999 --> 01:15:52,459
Who?

611
01:15:53,084 --> 01:15:55,587
What are you saying?
Where were you?

612
01:15:57,047 --> 01:15:59,215
Answer me!

613
01:16:02,886 --> 01:16:05,722
I won, you couldn't find me!

614
01:16:12,062 --> 01:16:13,646
I'm sorry.

615
01:16:17,108 --> 01:16:21,154
- It's over.
- Can I help you?

616
01:16:26,826 --> 01:16:29,662
Convince your mother
to let me stay here tonight.

617
01:16:29,746 --> 01:16:34,042
- You scared of the newspaperman?
- Just to stay with you.

618
01:16:34,334 --> 01:16:37,462
Okay, but if she says yes,
can we make peace?

619
01:16:38,421 --> 01:16:41,007
We've already made peace, my love.

620
01:16:45,512 --> 01:16:48,556
- Hurry, we're late!
- Don't run!

621
01:16:59,442 --> 01:17:01,820
Now how do we get to school?

622
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:10,161
You got yourself fired.
I'd have bet.

623
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:13,081
It's been bad news
since you set foot here.

624
01:17:13,123 --> 01:17:15,291
Let me stay a few more days.

625
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:17,794
Where do I put you?
It's all flooded downstairs.

626
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:22,924
And I want no trouble,
you're too dangerous.

627
01:17:24,718 --> 01:17:27,804
- You're ungrateful.
- I always respected our pacts.

628
01:17:27,929 --> 01:17:30,306
The money? I'll give it back.

629
01:17:32,017 --> 01:17:35,437
You never understood,
I love you.

630
01:17:36,896 --> 01:17:39,399
The two of us will go far.

631
01:17:42,235 --> 01:17:45,071
Already decided
how you'll have me killed?

632
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,825
What? You know
I always liked you.

633
01:17:51,244 --> 01:17:53,163
Too bad you've become
a little bizarre.

634
01:17:53,288 --> 01:17:56,124
Who knows where
we might have wound up!

635
01:17:57,042 --> 01:18:01,546
Right where we are now...
the end.

636
01:18:02,297 --> 01:18:05,091
- There's still some time.
- Then let's drink.

637
01:18:06,051 --> 01:18:08,803
If it's the last time,
I want to get drunk with you.

638
01:18:31,868 --> 01:18:34,454
Why do they call you Mold?

639
01:18:39,042 --> 01:18:40,085
Here.

640
01:18:40,835 --> 01:18:42,796
Take your hands off me.

641
01:18:45,006 --> 01:18:46,049
Sorry.

642
01:18:50,095 --> 01:18:53,556
Want me to talk to Mrs. Adacher?
She'll have you back.

643
01:18:56,184 --> 01:18:59,312
I'm too old for you.
What are you doing?

644
01:19:01,272 --> 01:19:02,440
Don't be afraid.

645
01:19:09,364 --> 01:19:11,658
- Give a kiss to Daddy.
- Bye-bye.

646
01:19:22,711 --> 01:19:23,878
Hi!

647
01:19:25,547 --> 01:19:30,427
- How are you?
- I tried, but she's angry, afraid.

648
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,846
- Of what?
- Of you.

649
01:19:35,682 --> 01:19:38,476
- What did you do to my mother?
- Nothing.

650
01:19:39,436 --> 01:19:42,147
Aren't you hiding
something from me too?

651
01:19:44,024 --> 01:19:47,277
I love you,
I'd do anything for you.

652
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:49,029
Tea...

653
01:19:50,488 --> 01:19:51,948
Thank you.

654
01:19:53,116 --> 01:19:54,868
- Hello.
- Hello.

655
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:57,203
I was just saying hello.

656
01:19:58,538 --> 01:20:00,331
- Please...
- I understand.

657
01:20:00,707 --> 01:20:04,377
She wants to come back,
but Mommy said no.

658
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,591
You need patience,
that's how my wife is.

659
01:20:10,842 --> 01:20:12,218
She'll get over it.

660
01:21:16,449 --> 01:21:19,077
It's small,
but brought me so much luck...

661
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,831
I prepared my exams here
and wrote my thesis.

662
01:21:22,872 --> 01:21:26,751
The rent's low, so I kept it.
Be great if you took it!

663
01:21:26,835 --> 01:21:30,130
- Where do those stairs go?
- A service exit.

664
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:30,482
Shut up!

665
01:22:33,985 --> 01:22:36,780
Think it'd be easy
to kill a guy like me?

666
01:22:36,988 --> 01:22:40,116
A few scissor stabs and bye-bye,
like the movies?

667
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,535
We can't all be good like you.

668
01:22:51,419 --> 01:22:54,339
Since you ran away,
I've had time...

669
01:22:54,631 --> 01:22:56,841
...to think how to get rid of you.

670
01:22:58,218 --> 01:23:00,303
Now, I've got a couple of ideas
how to kill you.

671
01:23:00,929 --> 01:23:04,557
- Pick the one you like best
and get it over with. - In time!

672
01:23:17,946 --> 01:23:20,365
I'm more generous than you, Giorgia.

673
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:24,494
If you answer me, I give my word
I'll leave you in peace.

674
01:23:25,453 --> 01:23:31,084
- Where's the money?
- What money? I don't know anything.

675
01:23:38,216 --> 01:23:40,510
Go! Go!

676
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,645
Don't come in!

677
01:23:52,022 --> 01:23:53,231
Please.

678
01:25:04,552 --> 01:25:08,723
I should have known who you were,
that it was blackmail.

679
01:25:11,351 --> 01:25:12,811
How much do you want?

680
01:25:14,896 --> 01:25:16,773
I don't want anything.

681
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:20,318
What are you after?
Friendship and comprehension?

682
01:25:28,868 --> 01:25:30,537
Get this in your head...

683
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:33,289
...I'll never let you steal
my daughter from me.

684
01:25:33,707 --> 01:25:36,960
- Your daughter?
- Yes, she's my daughter.

685
01:25:38,628 --> 01:25:44,592
Resign yourself, it's all legal.
You can't do anything.

686
01:25:46,761 --> 01:25:49,180
I'm her mother by all legal rights.

687
01:25:52,058 --> 01:25:53,518
Say an amount.

688
01:25:56,438 --> 01:25:58,606
I don't want
anything from you, Madame.

689
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,777
Then leave my daughter alone.

690
01:26:09,075 --> 01:26:12,120
Never show your face here again!

691
01:26:30,513 --> 01:26:32,891
Give back the keys to the car.

692
01:26:49,282 --> 01:26:50,533
And these?

693
01:26:51,826 --> 01:26:53,286
The house keys.

694
01:26:54,579 --> 01:26:58,083
You're a terrible thief too.
You gave them to me already.

695
01:27:02,379 --> 01:27:04,464
Who's the newspaperman?

696
01:27:06,466 --> 01:27:08,051
Go away, Madame.

697
01:27:13,765 --> 01:27:17,227
Get lost or you'll be sorry,
you and whoever's behind you!

698
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:33,201
You're in over your head.

699
01:27:33,702 --> 01:27:37,247
You've no idea the money
we could've made on this.

700
01:27:37,288 --> 01:27:41,209
- Don't you dare, she's not in this.
- But she's dangerous.

701
01:27:42,252 --> 01:27:45,672
Cough up the dough!
One week, or you're done for!

702
01:27:46,548 --> 01:27:50,468
I know you,
you'll get rid of me anyway.

703
01:27:50,677 --> 01:27:53,930
Believe me, sweetheart,
you'd be better off.

704
01:27:57,434 --> 01:27:59,811
I could have done it
lots of times...

705
01:28:00,145 --> 01:28:04,441
...but I never wanted to take her away.

706
01:28:06,818 --> 01:28:11,406
I just wanted to be near her,
that was enough.

707
01:28:12,866 --> 01:28:18,079
Watch her grow,
see how she was like her father.

708
01:28:21,207 --> 01:28:24,210
Maybe I should have done
like so many others...

709
01:28:24,336 --> 01:28:27,464
...who make a scandal...

710
01:28:27,922 --> 01:28:30,508
...and take back what's theirs.

711
01:28:31,384 --> 01:28:33,136
Maybe I still could.

712
01:28:53,406 --> 01:28:55,617
Why do you always make me sign?

713
01:28:59,496 --> 01:29:01,373
Why do you always make me sign?

714
01:29:03,124 --> 01:29:06,044
Hear that?
It's a few days now.

715
01:29:07,295 --> 01:29:09,089
So she can walk!

716
01:29:10,298 --> 01:29:13,301
It's important she can communicate.

717
01:29:18,515 --> 01:29:21,393
- Do you have an appointment?
- Well, no...

718
01:29:21,434 --> 01:29:24,062
...but Mr. Adacher knows me,
I worked for his wife.

719
01:29:24,104 --> 01:29:27,399
- Look...
- Just 5 minutes, it's urgent.

720
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,276
Alright, I'll see what I can do.

721
01:29:42,998 --> 01:29:44,958
- Are you Irena Yaroshenko?
- Yes.

722
01:29:45,291 --> 01:29:48,962
I'm sorry,
but Mr. Adacher can't see you.

723
01:29:49,045 --> 01:29:50,422
Has something happened?

724
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:10,483
Keep going! Again, again!

725
01:30:33,173 --> 01:30:36,384
- Hello, Mr. Adacher.
- Hello.

726
01:30:36,509 --> 01:30:40,055
It's good you came,
I'd have looked for you.

727
01:30:40,180 --> 01:30:43,183
I wanted to come earlier,
but was afraid of disturbing.

728
01:30:43,266 --> 01:30:44,934
Don't worry.

729
01:30:48,521 --> 01:30:51,024
- How's Tea?
- Not very well.

730
01:30:51,983 --> 01:30:54,319
She's jittery,
asks lots of questions...

731
01:30:54,402 --> 01:30:58,573
...like, when Valeria will return
from the trip we invented.

732
01:30:58,656 --> 01:31:00,408
Has she missed a lot of school?

733
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:04,371
She's at my sisters',
but doesn't like being there.

734
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:07,082
She also asks about you.

735
01:31:07,624 --> 01:31:12,629
If you like, I could keep her company
a few hours a day...

736
01:31:13,254 --> 01:31:16,841
Actually I wanted to ask you
to return full time.

737
01:31:17,592 --> 01:31:20,303
There's a room for you
in our new house.

738
01:31:20,345 --> 01:31:23,306
It would make Tea happy.

739
01:31:54,212 --> 01:31:57,382
Giorgia, you really like moving.

740
01:31:58,091 --> 01:32:00,927
Those who leave their country
move house a thousand times.

741
01:32:00,969 --> 01:32:03,304
Nice ditty, but cut the bullshit.

742
01:32:03,972 --> 01:32:05,306
Where's the money?

743
01:32:06,599 --> 01:32:09,519
Who says then you'll let me go?

744
01:32:09,602 --> 01:32:13,565
I swore to God
I'd break your neck...

745
01:32:13,732 --> 01:32:15,900
...but if He can turn a blind eye...

746
01:32:16,651 --> 01:32:20,572
- Just you and me.
- You never spoke such love.

747
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,283
Too bad.

748
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:33,460
Trust me now?

749
01:32:40,258 --> 01:32:45,555
These go in the study,
this needs fixing.

750
01:32:47,557 --> 01:32:48,600
Irena!

751
01:32:56,441 --> 01:32:57,692
Hello.

752
01:33:00,695 --> 01:33:02,697
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

753
01:33:03,323 --> 01:33:05,492
Better, now that I see you.

754
01:33:07,619 --> 01:33:09,496
I'll show you your room.

755
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:14,501
- See how big it is?
- Where's Mommy's room?

756
01:33:15,543 --> 01:33:19,923
We'll go later.
How do I arrange your furniture?

757
01:33:20,757 --> 01:33:24,511
Come on, darling,
we'll invent lots of things.

758
01:33:25,887 --> 01:33:29,099
There's not much to invent,
I want everything like before.

759
01:33:32,894 --> 01:33:35,480
What did you do to your hands?

760
01:33:36,064 --> 01:33:37,107
Irena?

761
01:33:38,983 --> 01:33:40,443
It's for you.

762
01:33:44,114 --> 01:33:46,741
- Are you Irena Yaroshenko?
- Yes.

763
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:49,327
Come with us to the station.

764
01:33:49,369 --> 01:33:52,914
- Why?
- A communication. - Alright.

765
01:33:57,627 --> 01:33:58,878
What's the matter?

766
01:34:01,798 --> 01:34:03,258
Nothing!

767
01:34:08,805 --> 01:34:10,056
I'll be right back.

768
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:35,749
Let me keep this one, please!

769
01:34:36,291 --> 01:34:41,087
What's it to you? I'll work
the whole time, just let me keep it!

770
01:34:41,212 --> 01:34:42,839
Leave me alone!

771
01:34:44,549 --> 01:34:47,427
Forget it, hear me?

772
01:34:48,595 --> 01:34:50,638
Do you have a license driver?

773
01:34:51,056 --> 01:34:52,098
Yes.

774
01:35:09,741 --> 01:35:17,999
I must have left it home,
but I know the number. RC 3097...

775
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:19,793
...254B.

776
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:26,257
- Recognize it?
- Yes.

777
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,053
And this?

778
01:35:35,684 --> 01:35:39,229
How was your relationship
with Mrs. Valeria Corsini Adacher?

779
01:35:39,354 --> 01:35:40,605
Excellent.

780
01:35:41,314 --> 01:35:43,316
When did you see herlast?

781
01:35:43,441 --> 01:35:45,902
Believe me, I liked her.

782
01:35:46,444 --> 01:35:49,906
But you had violent arguments.
Why?

783
01:35:50,323 --> 01:35:53,994
She wasn't happy with my work,
it happens.

784
01:35:54,035 --> 01:35:57,414
What about your fingerprints
on the dashboard?

785
01:35:57,622 --> 01:36:00,709
She drove that car everyday.

786
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:03,753
Counselor, the shoe, the license...

787
01:36:03,878 --> 01:36:06,589
I dropped them.
How's that figure with the accident?

788
01:36:06,715 --> 01:36:08,717
Mrs. Adacher
ran off the road...

789
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,052
...because the brakes and the engine
were tampered with.

790
01:36:11,094 --> 01:36:13,471
It wasn't an accident,
it's a homicide.

791
01:36:13,805 --> 01:36:17,142
I don't even know
where a car's brakes are!

792
01:36:17,225 --> 01:36:19,853
It's obvious
Irena Yaroshenko is innocent.

793
01:36:19,894 --> 01:36:22,188
The evidence is flimsy.

794
01:36:23,106 --> 01:36:24,357
Alright.

795
01:36:32,949 --> 01:36:35,327
What's "alright" mean?

796
01:36:35,618 --> 01:36:37,245
We didn't convince them.

797
01:36:53,845 --> 01:36:55,055
Supervisor!

798
01:37:04,647 --> 01:37:06,816
What place is this?

799
01:37:17,243 --> 01:37:20,872
Five steps from the watering trough,
towards the dog's grave.

800
01:37:20,914 --> 01:37:24,417
- That's where the money is.
- Dog's grave, the trough...

801
01:37:24,459 --> 01:37:27,003
What the hell's this,
a treasure hunt?

802
01:37:27,045 --> 01:37:31,216
- You're close.
- So, you fucker, start digging!

803
01:37:32,509 --> 01:37:33,718
Move!

804
01:37:34,761 --> 01:37:40,892
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, there!

805
01:37:41,184 --> 01:37:42,977
What can I do with you?

806
01:37:43,603 --> 01:37:44,979
Pick up the shovel!

807
01:37:46,356 --> 01:37:48,316
Your mother's cunt!

808
01:38:58,345 --> 01:39:00,430
He's the guilty one
you're looking for.

809
01:39:04,392 --> 01:39:05,852
Believe me now?

810
01:39:06,186 --> 01:39:08,605
Why should he have wanted
to do all this?

811
01:39:12,776 --> 01:39:14,027
To punish me.

812
01:39:15,278 --> 01:39:18,615
Maybe I don't remember,
maybe it's over there.

813
01:39:19,032 --> 01:39:23,119
What do you mean "over there"?
More this way, more that way...

814
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:25,997
You gotta come up with the money!

815
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:29,542
Hooker!

816
01:39:40,303 --> 01:39:41,763
He kept us like slaves.

817
01:39:41,805 --> 01:39:44,641
If we didn't bring
the sum he expected...

818
01:39:45,183 --> 01:39:49,145
...he'd hang us naked upside down
and pee on us.

819
01:39:49,688 --> 01:39:51,439
And the gifts?

820
01:39:51,606 --> 01:39:54,484
The times I got pregnant.

821
01:39:55,527 --> 01:40:01,157
It was his way of treating me nice:
Perfume, cell phones, shoes...

822
01:40:01,908 --> 01:40:04,703
And at the end 4 or 500 euros.

823
01:40:05,453 --> 01:40:07,038
At the end?

824
01:40:07,163 --> 01:40:09,207
When the deal was closed.

825
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:13,461
Did you know the people
these deals were made with?

826
01:40:13,753 --> 01:40:16,089
No, from the fourth month
I was locked in...

827
01:40:16,172 --> 01:40:18,258
...I didn't see anybody,
he did everything.

828
01:40:20,343 --> 01:40:23,680
- Explain that.
- Mold would procure the buyers.

829
01:40:24,014 --> 01:40:29,686
The first time I got pregnant by chance
and he found them at the eighth month.

830
01:40:29,728 --> 01:40:31,771
After that, it was always organized.

831
01:40:32,564 --> 01:40:36,109
- Meaning?
- The buyers chose one of us.

832
01:40:36,526 --> 01:40:39,612
Then, the chosen girl
took no more precautions...

833
01:40:39,696 --> 01:40:44,159
...and got pregnant.
- How many times were you?

834
01:40:45,076 --> 01:40:46,202
Nine.

835
01:40:49,289 --> 01:40:51,082
Nine babies in twelve years.

836
01:40:55,545 --> 01:40:57,130
The last one is Tea Adacher.

837
01:41:06,014 --> 01:41:07,057
Push!

838
01:41:09,893 --> 01:41:12,937
Try again, push!

839
01:41:17,233 --> 01:41:20,779
- Good!
- Come on! Good, this way!

840
01:41:20,945 --> 01:41:22,906
- Here it comes!
- Here!

841
01:41:24,616 --> 01:41:26,117
Come on, honey!

842
01:41:34,834 --> 01:41:36,127
Good!

843
01:41:39,714 --> 01:41:41,383
Good, you did well!

844
01:41:43,426 --> 01:41:47,806
Show me the baby.
Show me the baby.

845
01:41:47,972 --> 01:41:49,265
I'll take it.

846
01:41:49,349 --> 01:41:50,809
Show me the baby.

847
01:41:59,067 --> 01:42:00,235
Look at it...

848
01:42:03,571 --> 01:42:04,698
...and forget it.

849
01:42:30,598 --> 01:42:34,185
How can you be so sure
Tea Adacheris your daughter?

850
01:42:34,894 --> 01:42:38,565
Her birth date is
three days after my delivery.

851
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,985
Usually it takes longer
to register them.

852
01:42:42,027 --> 01:42:43,737
That's not sufficient proof.

853
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:47,449
No one ever saw Mrs. Adacher
during the pregnancy...

854
01:42:47,532 --> 01:42:50,535
...there's not one picture of her
with a belly.

855
01:42:50,618 --> 01:42:52,162
Every mother has one!

856
01:42:52,662 --> 01:42:56,541
Nor the analyses you do
when you're expecting.

857
01:42:57,083 --> 01:43:02,255
Absurd, isn't it? Tea doesn't look like
either of her parents.

858
01:43:02,714 --> 01:43:06,885
- In fact she's their adopted daughter.
- What makes you sure?

859
01:43:13,183 --> 01:43:17,645
I saw the adoption certificate,
they kept it in the safe.

860
01:43:19,939 --> 01:43:24,861
Tell the judge what your feelings were
towards the Adachers.

861
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:31,368
I loved them, they'd given my daughter
the future that I never could have.

862
01:43:31,409 --> 01:43:34,454
How did you find the Adachers?

863
01:43:34,537 --> 01:43:36,706
In Velarchi there are
12 Adacher families...

864
01:43:36,748 --> 01:43:39,417
...but they were the only ones
with a child of that age.

865
01:43:39,668 --> 01:43:44,130
How did you discover that
the name of the presumed buyers...

866
01:43:44,589 --> 01:43:48,843
...was Adacher?
- The obstetrician told me.

867
01:44:39,644 --> 01:44:43,815
Genna Lucrezia,
do you know Yaroshenko Irena?

868
01:44:43,898 --> 01:44:46,317
They called her Giorgia, right?

869
01:44:47,861 --> 01:44:49,738
Did you tell the judge?

870
01:44:51,031 --> 01:44:53,199
- Yes, I know her.
- Mh.

871
01:44:53,533 --> 01:44:57,037
There's a contradiction
in the statements of you both.

872
01:44:57,078 --> 01:45:01,249
You saw those who chose
and took the children.

873
01:45:01,291 --> 01:45:05,086
I didn't see anyone!
I don't know about any babies.

874
01:45:05,128 --> 01:45:07,797
- You're sick!
- We were at your house...

875
01:45:07,881 --> 01:45:12,761
...you were cooking eggplant,
you said: "Adacher, in Velarchi".

876
01:45:12,844 --> 01:45:17,807
- I can't cook eggplant.
- In your statement you say Adacher.

877
01:45:17,974 --> 01:45:20,018
How did you come to know this name?

878
01:45:21,394 --> 01:45:25,273
She badgered, wanting to know
things I didn't know.

879
01:45:25,482 --> 01:45:29,319
She was unbearable, she wanted me
to convince Mold to talk.

880
01:45:29,736 --> 01:45:32,238
I went one day...

881
01:45:32,989 --> 01:45:35,283
Give that bitch the name!

882
01:45:35,492 --> 01:45:37,994
I don't know the name.

883
01:45:39,079 --> 01:45:41,748
What's the name...

884
01:45:42,499 --> 01:45:44,459
I need an original name.

885
01:45:48,838 --> 01:45:49,881
Adacher.

886
01:45:51,675 --> 01:45:53,927
Say Adacherin Velarchi.

887
01:45:54,386 --> 01:45:56,054
So that's what I told you.

888
01:46:06,272 --> 01:46:10,151
Can't be,
she just wants revenge.

889
01:46:39,556 --> 01:46:40,932
Oh, gosh!

890
01:46:41,641 --> 01:46:45,854
Your decision to collaborate
was useful...

891
01:46:45,937 --> 01:46:49,024
...but I'm afraid
lots of things can't be overlooked.

892
01:46:49,566 --> 01:46:53,111
I reached my goal,
the rest doesn't matter.

893
01:46:54,404 --> 01:46:56,156
You all were great.

894
01:46:58,408 --> 01:47:00,702
I'd like to ask a question...

895
01:47:00,785 --> 01:47:04,289
By now you know all about me.
Go ahead.

896
01:47:05,165 --> 01:47:08,209
Didn't you ever think
about finding your children...

897
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:12,630
...the others too?
- No, just the last one.

898
01:47:13,673 --> 01:47:16,718
- How come?
- I don't know.

899
01:47:18,178 --> 01:47:20,597
Maybe because I knew
who the father was.

900
01:47:21,222 --> 01:47:24,768
Lately however
I've been thinking of the others too.

901
01:47:26,144 --> 01:47:31,733
All I know's their age,
I make up the rest.

902
01:47:33,234 --> 01:47:38,239
If I hadn't found Tea,
maybe I'd have looked for them too.

903
01:47:41,451 --> 01:47:43,244
I have something to tell you also.

904
01:47:45,330 --> 01:47:46,373
Go ahead.

905
01:47:48,375 --> 01:47:51,920
The DNA shows
that Tea is not your daughter.

906
01:47:53,838 --> 01:47:57,759
That document was only
a request for fosterage.

907
01:47:58,093 --> 01:48:01,513
You should have noticed
the child's name was missing.

908
01:48:01,930 --> 01:48:04,099
It's a fully legal adoption...

909
01:48:04,474 --> 01:48:07,227
...the natural mother
disappeared after delivery.

910
01:48:09,354 --> 01:48:15,652
The judge has asked me to make you
a very particular proposal.

911
01:48:16,736 --> 01:48:19,322
You've no obligation to say yes.

912
01:49:08,621 --> 01:49:10,790
Sweetie!

913
01:49:14,878 --> 01:49:17,589
Don't you know me?
Are you mad at me?

914
01:49:22,302 --> 01:49:23,345
Forgive me.

915
01:49:27,891 --> 01:49:32,187
I had to go to my country, far away.

916
01:49:33,772 --> 01:49:38,777
You take trips too.
You're not a good nanny...

917
01:49:38,902 --> 01:49:42,322
...before you'd have asked
my mother's permission.

918
01:49:44,616 --> 01:49:47,243
I'm getting old, I forget things.

919
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:52,332
- Next time ask me.
- Sure, Madame President.

920
01:49:56,586 --> 01:49:57,754
Hey!

921
01:49:59,756 --> 01:50:00,924
What's wrong?

922
01:50:01,758 --> 01:50:06,429
I went down, this time
I don't know who to beat up.

923
01:50:08,223 --> 01:50:10,934
Is that why you don't want to eat?

924
01:50:19,984 --> 01:50:23,113
When you fall
and you don't know who pushed you...

925
01:50:23,446 --> 01:50:27,200
...take it out on the first you meet,
but never on yourself.

926
01:50:28,743 --> 01:50:31,371
This time
you didn't bring me a present.

927
01:50:32,956 --> 01:50:37,961
That's true, but I worked
to get you one that's very big.

928
01:50:38,461 --> 01:50:44,259
It's a secret for now, but in a while
you'll be really surprised.

929
01:50:45,176 --> 01:50:49,055
- How long?
- You'll be a grown, beautiful girl.

930
01:50:51,057 --> 01:50:53,226
Is it possible to wait so long?

931
01:50:54,602 --> 01:50:58,940
Sure, important things
take lots of patience.

932
01:51:00,316 --> 01:51:03,486
So, you have to eat to grow up.

933
01:51:05,363 --> 01:51:09,617
You won't need a nanny
to help you eat...

934
01:51:11,619 --> 01:51:17,917
...to pick your clothes out in the morning.
You'll do everything by yourself.

935
01:51:21,546 --> 01:51:23,840
Are you saying
you won't stay with me?

936
01:51:24,382 --> 01:51:29,804
A maid is never forever,
sooner orlater she leaves...

937
01:51:32,307 --> 01:51:33,808
...or gets fired.

938
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:38,897
I haven't fired you.

939
01:51:39,314 --> 01:51:44,444
I know,
but I had to take another job.

940
01:51:49,157 --> 01:51:51,326
Give it up
or find a way to get fired.

941
01:51:52,494 --> 01:51:56,247
That's hard,
it isn't a job like the others.

942
01:51:57,207 --> 01:52:01,503
If you hurry and learn to write,
we'll exchange lots of letters.

943
01:52:02,462 --> 01:52:06,716
And you'll tell me
how it feels to become a woman.

944
01:52:08,385 --> 01:52:09,844
You should know.

945
01:52:11,221 --> 01:52:14,140
I was too distracted in my life...

946
01:52:15,975 --> 01:52:17,602
...I didn't even realize.

947
01:52:27,821 --> 01:52:31,700
So the things you taught me
