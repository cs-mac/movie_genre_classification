00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,700
...and then make a guy work this hard
trying to be one.

308
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,500
Unless you actually do think I'm a jerk.
Then I'll just go.

309
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,400
Run tell your friends about the freak.

310
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,500
You really think I'm that guy?

311
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,900
No.

312
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,500
Okay.

313
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
I should get back.

314
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,800
You, uh, read those chapters
in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird?</i>

315
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Yeah, I've read it twice before.

316
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,700
- Oh, it's good, isn't it?
- Yeah.

317
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,700
- You ever see the movie?
- No.

318
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,900
Oh, it's good too.
We should watch it, actually.

319
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,800
- You ever read any Vonnegut?
- No.

320
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Kurt Vonnegut? No?
<i>Slaughterhouse-Five?</i>

321
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,000
He's great. He's banned too, actually.

322
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,300
LENA: - You only read banned books?
- Um, I don't only read banned books.

323
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,700
But, I don't know, I just...

324
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,000
All the books they let you read are,
like, pretty boring, I guess.

325
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
Thanks. I'm sorry I was...

326
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,800
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

327
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,100
You should go. My uncle doesn't really
like people being around the house.

328
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,400
I know. I sort of, uh...

329
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,200
...went inside.

330
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,200
You went inside the house?

331
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
I didn't mean to. I just...

332
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,500
I get it.

333
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,900
People think he's scary,
but he's just Boo Radley shy, right?

334
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,000
Okay.

335
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,000
Hey, um...

336
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,100
I got you sort of a
"Welcome to Suckass Gatlin" gift, heh.

(LENA CHUCKLES)

I thought you could put it on your...
On your chain.

MACON: Lena?

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,500
We have a guest?

341
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,800
- He's leaving.
- Hello, sir.

342
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,800
Manners? That's nice.

343
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,600
I go to school with Lena.

344
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,300
I'm Ethan Wate.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

345
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
You Lila Evers' boy?

346
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,300
Yes, sir.

347
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,600
You knew my mother?

348
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,500
Lena, why don't you ask
your friend in for tea?

349
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
- Tell him you can't stay.
- I'd love to. Thank you, sir.

350
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
He's not scary.

351
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,100
MACON: Mr. Wate, make yourself comfortable.

352
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,900
Oh, I... I'm sorry about walking in
uninvited before.

353
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,000
No problem at all.

354
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,200
It's so rarely that we get visitors
from our...

355
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,700
...beloved Gatlin.

356
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,700
Don't be a snob, uncle. It's not their fault
you never speak to any of them.

357
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,400
And it's not my fault
that I have a predilection for good breeding...

358
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,200
...reasonable intelligence,
and passable personal hygiene.

359
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,100
(CHUCKLES)

360
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,100
But since my family founded this town,
I have no alternative to call it home.

361
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
So...

362
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,800
...there we are.

363
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,300
Oh, that's a beautiful piano.

364
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,800
Oh, yes. Do you play?

365
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,200
No.

366
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,700
Hmm.

367
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,900
Lena, why don't you play something
for our guest?

368
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Because we're not in a Jane Austen novel.

369
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,200
Then why don't you go make us some tea?

370
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
Again, wrong century.

371
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,200
Well, then, would it
disturb either of you if I...

372
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,200
...ran my fingers across the ivories?

373
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,300
I find it very therapeutic.

374
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,300
Uncle's upset. School called.

375
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,600
Put me on probation
until the window thing gets investigated.

376
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,700
That's crazy. That was not your fault.

in a town of buttermilk minds.

379
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,300
Lena, I could get to like this friend of yours.

380
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,900
I mean, it's like blaming you
for the lightning on Honey Hill.

381
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,200
MACON: Oh, heh, yes, I heard about the lightning.

382
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,200
In fact, a similar occurrence...

383
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,800
...took place in Venezuela
for many years at Lake Maracaibo.

384
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,800
- You can look it up on Google.
- Uncle loves Google.

385
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,500
In any event, I'll sort it outwith the school.

386
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
But I understand your indignation, Ethan.

387
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,800
Probation. Implies a source of authority.
What is that source?

388
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
A bunch of sexually frustrated housewives...

389
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,500
...with miniscule minds
and voluminous backs-ides.

(CHUCKLES)

391
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,200
No, there's only two kind
of people in Gatlin:

392
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,900
The ones who are too stupid to leave
and the ones who are too stuck to move.

393
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,000
My mother used to say
that exact same thing.

394
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,800
Is that so?

395
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,700
Well, she was a lovely woman, your mother.

396
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,000
I was so sorry to hear of her passing.

397
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,800
Of course, I only knew her
through her books.

398
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,800
I read everything she wrote
on the Southern plantations.

399
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,200
- You plan on being a writer?
- I don't know yet. Maybe.

- What if I had a magic wand...
- Macon.

401
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,900
...and I could let you see your whole future?

402
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,900
What would be there?

403
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,900
And don't spare me the gory details.

404
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,100
Well, sir, I'm not sure.

405
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Urn, one thing I do know, though, is college.
I'm definitely planning on going.

406
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,300
Oh, really? Where have you applied?

407
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,700
All of them. As long as they're
not too far from home, heh.

408
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,000
I mean, uh, as long as it's a local college.
Uh...

409
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,100
Uh...

410
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,900
So I can stay with Dad.

411
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,500
I'll get my teaching degree,
and probably teach at the high school.

412
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,400
Or maybe I'll take over the library
from Amma.

413
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,300
I'll probably marry Emily Asher
and we'll have two kids.

414
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,000
But I'll never make enough money for her,
so I'll start drinking...

415
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,500
...get three DUI's and lose my job.

416
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,700
And, uh, have an affair on and off
with Savannah Snow until I'm 49.

417
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,000
The kids will live with their mother
after we divorce.

418
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,300
Then when I'm 52,
I'll have my first heart attack, another one at 63.

419
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,600
I'll move into an apartment
above the Wayward Dog bar...

420
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,400
...and help them sweep up
after hours for free drinks.

421
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,500
And then when I'm 64, I'll hang myself.

422
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Um...

423
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,700
But they won't find the body right away.

424
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,200
Not until I stink.

425
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,300
MACON: Well, you've got it all planned out.

426
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,400
Good for you.

427
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,300
- Ethan, are you okay?
ETHAN: - Yeah.

428
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,400
Urn, you'll have to excuse me.
Heh, I've not been sleeping too well.

429
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,400
What did you do to him?

430
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,500
I agreed to let you attend what passes
for a school in this town, but no friendships.

431
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,600
Could you not at least let me pretend
until my birthday?

432
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,200
You remember what happened
at the last school?

433
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
This window shattering
is just the beginning.

434
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,600
That boy is a danger to you.
Don't invite him here again.

435
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,900
(SOBBING) Oh, I wouldn't worry.
I'm sure he won't be back.

436
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,300
- You came back.
- Yeah. I... I'm sorry.

437
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,300
- I don't know what happened to me in there.
- It's not your fault.

438
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,200
I hope this doesn't sound weird,
but I think I've been dreaming about you...

439
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,600
...every night for months.

440
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,000
That did not sound as creepy when I...

441
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,900
In my head, heh.
Can you forget I said that?

442
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,900
- Sure.
- Okay.

443
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,400
Um...

444
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,900
Oh. Your present.

445
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,600
- Right. Great. The present. Heh.
- That's why I came back. Heh.

446
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,400
Uh, so, it opens, see? Um...

447
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,700
"E-C-W, G-K-D.

449
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,100
December 21st?

450
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,700
Yeah.

451
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,900
What's the matter?

452
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,500
Oh, it's my birthday. I'll be 16.

453
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,700
Wow, that's...

454
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,500
That is amazing.

455
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,300
I don't... You know,
I don't believe in signs, usually...

456
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,700
...but that seems like a pretty badass sign,
heh.

457
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So you're 15 and you're a junior?

458
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,100
That's... You must be a brain.

459
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,100
- You skip a grade?
- Yeah.

460
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,600

Oh, Amma, what are you doing?

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,800
I'm looking for books your mother had
to return to the library.

- How did I get home?

What? When I got here,
you were already in bed.

474

Been feeling something every night
since you brought that girl.

It's the only place left I have to protect her.

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,300
Well, that's not Lena.

580

Sarafine?

581
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,400
You said she was gone for good.

582
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,400
Yeah. Well, we...
We did have an agreement, but...

583
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,400
...she's been shadowing Lena
for the past year.

584
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,300
And there have been some accidents.

585
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,900
Macon, no danger better come
to that boy because of your kind.

586
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,500
Yeah, well, then, you Keep him on a leash.

587
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,300
- What happened at Greenbrier?
- I don't know.

588
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,900
Lena was hysterical.

589
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,100
Boy was unconscious.
I brought him home, called you.

590
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,600
You're the seer, you tell me what happened.

591
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,300
This is the sacred place of my ancestors.
You hear?

592
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,700
You want some answers,
you show me some respect.

593
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,900
Yeah, I... I apologize.

594
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,400
Ethan had some kind of charm.
It had a Duchannes power in it.

595
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,600
Well, that would be Sarafine.

596
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,000
Maybe she's using the charm
to get to Lena through the boy.

597
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,700
You tell them I have to know
what Sarafine's up to.

598
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,100
It wouldn't break your face to ask
for help instead of expecting it.

599
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,900
Like your family's been doing for too
many years. Don't roll your eyes at me.

600
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,300
Then please ask them kindly
what Sarafine is up to.

601
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,700
Brought your favorites, Uncle Abner.

602
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,200
Shrimp and grits.

603
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Fried oysters.

604
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
And a coconut pie.

605
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,200
Hmm. No wonder he's no longer with us.

606
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,900
Pay no attention to him, uncle.

607
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,200
Uncle Abner,
we are in need of your intercession.

608
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,200
Along with Aunt Ida and Auntie May...

609
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,600
...I humbly call upon your spirits.

610
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,400
What are they saying?

611
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,700
Nothing. Nothing yet.

612
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,500
Tell them they have to help us stop Sarafine.

613
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,500
Somethings cannot be stopped.

00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,400
And I'd say, "Mom, I'm 9. How do I do that?"

621
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,200
Little Ethan.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

623
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,600
So that's when she took me to the library.

624
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,900
And, um, she said:

625
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,300
"Ethan, this is my church.

626
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,900
This is where my family goes
to celebrate what's holy:

627
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,800

628
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,100
Oh, wow, sorry. Ha, ha.

629
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,600
Don't know where that came from.

Let's get out of here. Let's go.

633
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,600
- Where?
- Anywhere.

634
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,600
Lena, most people spend their entire lives...

635
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,700
...waiting for a moment that's gonna change
everything. It never happens.

636
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,500
We can start our lives right now, okay?

637
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,900
We just gotta say yes,
we just gotta get in the car, and just go.

638
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,300
- I can't do that.
- Why?

639
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,400
When I turn 16, I might not even be
who I am now.

640
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,500
Why? What...?

641
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,500
What could happen
besides getting your first hangover?

(CHUCKLES)

643
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,200
When a female Caster turns 16,
we face what they call the Claiming.

644
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,200
My powers will be claimed
for either the Light or the Dark...

645
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,100
...depending on my true nature.

646
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,200
Whatever I'm destined to be.

647
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,500
That's... That's why Macon brought me here.

648
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,600
Wait, what's Macon?

649
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,600
He's a Dark Caster, but he's choosing
to be Light for me now.

650
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,200
He can choose? Then why can't you?

651
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,300
They say that a female Caster's
true nature chooses for her.

652
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,200
I don't know why.

653
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,200
Back up, wait a minute.

654
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,800
You're worried that when you turn 16,
you're gonna be an evil...

655
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,800
...bitch... Witch Caster?

656
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,400
I have 75 days left, Ethan.

657
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,400
I don't know what I'll be.

658
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,300
I don't know who I really am inside.

659
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,500
Now, in the last year, Lena Duchannes
has been in three different schools...

660
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,900
...in three different towns.

661
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,400
I checked. And in every single one
of them schools, they had accidents...

662
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,100
...they had unnatural weather, they had...

663
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,800
Well, they even had deaths.

How dare you enter the house of the Lord?

679
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,700
Since my family own the land it's built on.

680
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,900
And I understood this to be an occasion
for all members of the community.

681
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,100
Now, I'm sure y'all have better things
to do on such a beautiful day...

682
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,400
...so I'll be brief.

683
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,400
The accusations against my niece
are all spurious lies.

684
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:33,700
For, according to the Weather Channel,
and you can verify this on Google...

685
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,100
...there were unseasonably
strong gusts from the east...

686
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,100
...which caused untold destruction
up and down the South Carolina coast.

687
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,800
So my niece will go back to the institution...

688
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,100
...that Gatlin presumes to call educational.

689
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,900
And she will be persecuted no longer.

You have no right to tell us what to do.

692
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,300
No matter how much money you have.

693
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,300
Oh, Mrs. Lincoln, you're right.

694
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,600
My wealth should offer me no advantage.

695
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,900
However, since my ancestors
founded Gatlin...

696
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,000
...my holdings do give me a little leverage.

697
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,800
For example, if I were to donate the old mill...

698
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,100

There again, I own the land
the Wayward Dog motel stands on.

702
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,900
Its closure would cause a little inconvenience
to one or two of you gentlemen. Heh.

703

01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,500
<i>I know her like I know myself.</i>

1090
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:43,600
<i>And I can feel her slipping away
into some place where I can't reach her.</i>

1091
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,200
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1092
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:02,500
WOMAN: (ON TV)
<i>Go away, go away, go away, go away!</i>

1093
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,700
- Hi, clear.
ETHAN: - Oh.

1094
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:15,200
- Hello, Mrs. Lincoln. Just a minute.
MRS. LINCOLN: - Hi, dear.

1095
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,700
Oh, dear.

1096
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,800
This door seems to be stuck.

1097
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,300
It's just these old houses.
They're such a nuisance.

1098
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,000
- Yes, ma'am.
- They warp.

1099
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,700
- Link's not here.
- Oh, I know, I know.

1100
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,900
He's at Savannah Snow's party,
which is where all the kids are.

1101
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,800
I had to make quite a number
of phone calls...

1102
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,600
...to get him an invitation
on account of his...

1103
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,800
Well, on account of his friendship with you.

1104
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Oh, I'm sorry you had to go
to that trouble, ma'am.

1105
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,300
Well, you should be at that party, Ethan...

1106
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,200
...kicking up your heels with your real friends,
with the children who belong in this town.

1107
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,400
I'm not much up for a party tonight, ma'am.

1108
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,200
Oh, well, that's a shame.

1109
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,000
Well, see, I... I made you some brownies.

1110
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:02,700
I thought maybe I could come in
and we could talk.

1111
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,500
My fight’s not with you, son.

1112
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,000
It's not. Never has been.

1113
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,900
It's just that girl
with her seductive quirkiness...

1114
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,200
...and you being motherless and all.

1115
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,600
May I come in?

1116
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,200
No, ma'am. I... I don't think so.

1117
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,000
Did I hear you correctly just then, Ethan?

1118
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:29,600
Do I have to ask you again? May I come in?

1119
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,200
No, ma'am, you may not.

1120
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,900
But I have made you brownies.

1121
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,700
I've made you brownies from scratch.

1122
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,000
Well, slap my ass and call me Sally!

1123
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,800
(LAUGHS)

1124
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,400
Lena bound your house. Oh, that's so sweet.

1125
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,800
As if.

1126
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,200
SARAFINE: <i>I'm on your side, son.</i>

1127
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,500
<i>What's a little curse
when it comes to true love?</i>

1128
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,300
<i>Anyone can see you and Lena
are just meant for each other...</i>

1129
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,600
<i>...till death do you part.</i>

1130
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,500
(SARAFINE LAUGHS)

1131
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,900
Lena?

1132
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:09,000
MACON: Get out of this house.

1133
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,700
Lena.

1134
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,300
MACON: Keep her bound.

1135
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,200
ETHAN: Lena.

1136
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:23,000
Lena, can we please just go outside
for one second and talk? I need...

1137
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,700
MACON: - Get out!
- No!

1138
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,900
Please, son, for your own good.

1139
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,800
You should really listen to them.

1140
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,400
No!

1141
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,400
I'm sick of listening to your family.

1142
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:40,400
I have been chased, spun, hypnotized...

1143
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,400
...paralyzed, and damn near killed
by your family.

1144
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,000
I've been going out of my mind
for the last two weeks.

1145
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,800
Now your mother shows up on my doorstep
and damn near gives me a heart attack!

1146
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,300
But you know what?
I don't care about them, about the curse.

1147
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,100
You are not going Dark
and you are not losing me.

1148
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,900
No matter what you do,
no matter what they do to me, I'm still here.

1149
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,000
Now what does that tell you?

1150
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:08,400
MACON: How could the boy break our spell?
He has no power.

1151
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,000
It's not we who protect her now, it's the boy.

1152
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,700
Amma, we need your help.

1153
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,500
Why come to me?

1154
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:30,700
LENA: The way you talked about the locket,
about the curse.

1155
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:34,700
Excuse me, Miss Amma,
but I think you know more than you're saying.

1156
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,000
Please, Amma.

1157
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,200
This isn't the place you're gonna find
anything you need.

1158
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,000
Meet me in the back.

1159
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,300
ETHAN:
This must run under the whole town.

1160
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:25,200
The whole country.
Gatlin is like the capital of Caster America.

1161
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,300
It used to be under Washington, D.C.
until Nancy Reagan made them move.

1162
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,900
She was the only mortal
they were ever scared of.

1163
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,400
They know a Caster's here.

1164
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,900
Amma, why didn't you tell us about this?

1165
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,400
A Keeper has to be asked.

1166
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,500
A Keeper, as in you're a...?

1167
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:06,200
The Caster Library has been the responsibility
of Seers like me for generations.

1168
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:12,200
Something I had no choice about either,
by the way.

1169
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:17,600
And these books hold the histories
of the Casters from around the world...

1170
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,700
...the laws that keep balance
between Light and Dark.

1171
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,100
Hey! Get away from that.

1172
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:28,500
Macon comes here every day and reads
every book he can for the Forbidden Spell.

1173
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,100
- He found nothing?
AMMA: - Mm-mm.

1174
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,600
But you can do it.

1175
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,900
God gives us what we can handle,
even if we don't believe it ourselves.

1176
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,200
Close your eyes.

1177
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:50,500
See with your mind what you're looking for
as if you've already found it.

1178
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,400
I knew it.

1179
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,700
<i>Book of Moons.</i>

1180
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,900
It's the most powerful book
of the Otherworld.

1181
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,800
It's as alive as you or me.
Strongest of every spells, good and bad.

1182
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:17,200
- Did Macon look through it?
- No, he couldn't.

1183
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:20,700
The Book chooses who reads it.
Its Law is "Like attracts Like."

1184
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,500
There... There's no writing.

1185
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,500
It won't reveal itself so easy.

1186
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:36,200
A curse this dark takes its time showing itself.
The Dark will test you.

1187
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:38,000
Don't worry, you'll find it.

1188
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,900
Just look under
"How Not to Turn Into Your Mother."

1189
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,000
(LENA CHUCKLES)

1190
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Come on. Come on.

1191
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:20,800
ETHAN: <i>I've been taking Lena
to the Caster Library for weeks now.</i>

1192
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,200
<i>But Lena's getting discouraged.</i>

1193
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,100
<i>The longer this thing takes,
the more I see a change in her.</i>

1194
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,400
We'll find a way, okay?

1195
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,900
You're just a mortal, how would you know?

1196
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,400
Hey, I can make wind.
Maybe not a hurricane...

1197
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,300
- Why don't we just admit it?
- Admit what?

1198
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,900
It's already started.
I'm turning into a Dark bitch, I can feel it.

1199
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,500
No, Lena, you're just stressed. It's not...

1200
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,700
It doesn't matter what causes it.

1201
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,800
I'm turning
and you're just too stupid to see it.

1202
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,900
Okay, now you're a bitch.

1203
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,600
(THUNDER CRASHES)

1204
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,800
Really? Is this necessary?

1205
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,900
I'm agreeing with you.

1206
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,200
Okay, I'm just a dumb-ass mortal
who can't make his own thunder.

1207
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,500
But I know there's no way
we're gonna figure this out...

1208
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:43,100
...unless you stop feeling so sorry
for yourself all the time!

(SCREAMS)

1210
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,200
Go ahead! Start an earthquake,
see where it gets you.

1211
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,000
Everybody has to deal with shit
in their lives, Lena.

1212
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,700
What are you yelling at me for?

1213
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,200
You want to be a normal human?
What do you think that is?

1214
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,500
We don't have powers
to just change things whenever we like.

1215
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:04,600
Being human is feeling bad,
it's feeling pissed off.

1216
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,700
It's feeling scared
and not being able to do anything about it...

1217
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,700
...until you don't feel that way anymore,
until you can see your way out of it.

1218
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,000
And I yelled at you because I care about you!

1219
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,000
That's what normal people do,
who love each other...

1220
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,900
...when one of them is acting like a brat.

1221
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,400
Now, would you please stop raining on me?

1222
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,700
I'm sorry.

1223
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,200
You've got to get away from me.

1224
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:05,500
I don't know what I do, it just happens.

1225
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:08,200
You still don't get it, do you?

1226
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:12,000
I don't want to be any further away
from you than I am right now...

1227
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,200
...one way or another.

1228
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,600
I'm scared I'm gonna hurt you.

1229
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,800
Well, love's a risk for anybody.

1230
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,800
I mean, "kill you" hurt you.

1231
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,600
Go ahead.

1232
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,000
Kill me.

1233
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,600
Oh! Ooh, ah.

1234
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:11,000
What part of "You cannot touch it
if you are not a Caster" don't you understand?

1235
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,700
There were Casters in the Civil War?

1236
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:20,800
Casters have been fighting alongside mortals
for centuries, every war, every side.

1237
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:23,900
Just because they're supernatural

- ...is you go to church every Sunday.
- Mm-hm.

1240
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,000
How do you believe in all this
and still believe in God?

1241
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,800
God created all things, didn't he?

1242
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,100
It's only men who go and decide
which ones are mistakes.

1243

My mom came here, didn't she?

1244
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,200
With Macon?

1245
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,300
They met here many times.

1246
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,100
Macon loved teaching her about his world.

1247
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,300
Macon loved her, didn't he?

1248
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,300
No one knows what Macon
can and can't feel, but...

1249
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,100
...Lila sure got close.

1251
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,400
She loved your father.

You going somewhere?

1254
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:45,200
Wherever Lena is. Even if that's in Gatlin.

1255
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,800
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know what...

1256
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:52,300
...power you have over Lena, but, uh...

1257
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,500
...I've come to ask you to...

1258
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:56,900
...let her go.

1259
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,300
I don't have any power, Macon.

1260
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,800
I just love her.

1261
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,500
Then just put an end to it.

1262
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,100
I can't, heh.

1263
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:11,100
Even if it means
destroying the Lena you love, hmm?

1264
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,800
It can't, because there's no way
that what Lena and I feel for each other...

1265
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,500
...is gonna turn into something
wrong or evil.

You have no real power.

You live at the mercy
of forces outside your control.

And yet, you believe that what you feel...

...will somehow make it all right.

1272

01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,700
So I was wondering...

1284
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,900
Well, I've gotta do it on my own, kind of.

1285

You know, and if you're here,
you're just gonna distract me.

And I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind going home now.

And then, when I'm done, I'll call you later.

There's only one way to break the curse.

1304
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:04,100
Genevieve used the Forbidden Spell...

1305
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,200
...to give life to the one she loved.

1306
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:14,100
To break the curse,
the one that I love has to die.

1307
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:16,600
Oh, God.

1308

01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,400
I won't hurt Ethan.

01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,500
Never.

I need to do these certain rituals...

We know what's gonna happen.

About a word we don't hear much anymore:

1376
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,500
Sacrifice.

1377
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,300
It's not what I'd call a modern word.

1378
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:16,500
People hear the word "sacrifice"
and they become afraid...

1379
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:19,500
...that something
will be taken away from them.

1380
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:23,000
Or they'll have to give up something
they can't live without.

1381
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:27,100
"Sacrifice," to them, means "loss"...

1382
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,500
...in a world telling us we can have it all.

1383
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,500
But I believe true sacrifice is a victory.

1384
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,800
Because it requires our free will...

1385
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,200
...to give up something
or someone you love...

1386
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:48,100
...for something or someone
you love more than yourself.

<i>Sacrifice won't take away the pain of loss.</i>

1390
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,900
<i>But it wins the battle against bitterness.</i>
