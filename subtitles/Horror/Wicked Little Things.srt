1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,344
Bull Foreman!

2
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,725
Get these little immigrant bastards
on their feet.

3
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,927
We've got two hours
of daylight left.

4
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,061
You heard Mr. Carlton.
You got two hours.

5
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,720
l need a small one.

6
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,687
You.

7
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,892
What's your name?

8
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,229
Mary.

9
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,635
Down!

10
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,052
Just get in there,
and don't think about it.

11
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:37,517
Just leave the sticks
and back out now.

12
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,471
Mary!

13
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,710
Come on! Get out here!

14
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,517
Old Man Carlton wants
this section open.

15
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,522
Now light it up!

16
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,921
She's just a child.

17
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,891
You want to be out on your ass?

18
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,450
Sarah, stop it.

19
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,757
Okay, it's enough, Sarah.

20
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,165
God, you've been fudging
with the radio for an hour now.

21
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,426
You can say fuck, Mom.

22
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,963
l've heard it before.

23
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,175
Mommy, how much longer?

24
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,211
Soon, Emma.

25
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,644
Very, very soon.

26
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,237
You said that like an hour ago.

27
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,114
Okay, so we're going
to stop up here in Addytown

28
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,950
and get some supplies,
and then the house...

29
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,615
is not far up the mountain from there.

30
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,723
Can l get a candy bar, Mom?

31
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,531
Please, Mom, just one. Please?

32
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,628
Do you want anything, Sarah?

33
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,036
Yeah, to go home.

34
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,334
Will that be all, ma'am?

35
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,807
Yeah...

36
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:10,968
and the candy bar.

37
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,173
$32. 18.

38
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,645
On the house, little one.

39
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,380
These pictures are kind of creepy.

40
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,379
Easy to get lost in these woods.

41
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,222
Might l ask what you're doing
up in these hills?

42
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,053
Oh, we're moving here.

43
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,251
To Addy?

44
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,387
No, little further up. Carlton?

45
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,124
My husband--

46
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,723
My late husband was a Tunny.

47
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,359
Did you know them?

48
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,596
l know the house.

49
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,366
Ain't been no Tunnys
around here in years, though.

50
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,932
Yeah, l think my husband
was one of the last.

51
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,910
But we inherited the house, so...

52
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,242
We don't make deliveries up there.

53
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,708
Okay.

54
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:52,842
l'm sorry, l didn't catch your name.

55
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,284
Walter.

56
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,015
Walter, l'm Karen.

57
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,920
What's your name, little one?

58
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,056
Emma.

59
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,356
This is Sarah.

60
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,862
Let's get out of here
before it gets dark.

61
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,230
These woods creep me out.

62
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,036
Well, thank you, Walter.
lt was very nice to meet you.

63
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,836
- l'm sure we'll be seeing a lot of you.
- You bet.

64
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,273
Bye, Emma.

65
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,745
What's that movie called about the guy
who gets his head chopped off?

66
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,588
- Why did he get his head chopped off?
- Stop scaring Emma.

67
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,150
Yeah, Johnny Depp was in it.

68
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,589
That's what this looks like.

69
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,157
Like we're in the frickin'
Legend of Sleepy Holow.

70
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,808
Asshole!

71
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,777
Asshole.

72
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,405
Hey! Emma, it's not funny.

73
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,027
Jesus, Mom,
you almost killed us!

74
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,293
ls everyone okay?

75
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,460
Yeah, except for the fact
that l almost pissed my pants!

76
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,697
- Mom, where are you going?
- Just stay here.

77
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,468
Hello?

78
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,017
Where did he go?

79
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,055
l don't know.

80
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,482
He just disappeared.

81
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,154
That's got to be it.

82
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,871
You cannot be serious.

83
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,474
ls this where we're going
to live, Mom?

84
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,849
For a while, baby.

85
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,150
There's no way l'm living here.

86
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,314
Mom, it's a wreck.

87
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,948
We're in the middle of nowhere.

88
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,118
Quit your bitching.

89
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,101
What's that on the door?

90
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,806
What is it, Mom?

91
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,211
l don't know, baby.

92
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,772
lt looks like paint or something.

93
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,512
Looks like blood to me.

94
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,952
Why would it be blood?

95
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,489
lt's not blood.

96
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,252
Give it a rest.

97
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,800
Lock's broken.

98
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,569
That's reassuring.

99
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,284
Great, no electricity.

100
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,784
Wow, it's big.

101
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,658
lt's bigger than our other house!

102
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,166
l want to see my room!

103
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,998
Be careful, Emma!

104
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,633
This place is filthy.

105
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,774
l wonder how old
that Christmas tree is?

106
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,345
At least they had a Christmas.

107
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,785
Why don't we get everything out of the car,
you know, before it gets dark?

108
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,293
l'm going to go look
for the breaker box.

109
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,854
Why don't you see if
the water's turned on yet, okay?

110
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,491
Fine.

111
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,694
Figures.

112
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,109
There's frickin' rats!

113
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,349
One just tried to rip my throat out.

114
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,389
Mom!

115
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,195
What if the rat comes back?

116
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,238
He won't.

117
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,800
But what if he does?

118
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,779
Then we'll chop him up
and feed him to the monster.

119
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,077
What monster?

120
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,584
Would you please stop
scaring your sister?

121
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,646
l want to go home.

122
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,951
This is our home.

123
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,622
At least until l can figure
out what to do with it.

124
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,031
This is not home.

125
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,592
This is Dad's bad joke on us.

126
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,440
Don't do this, Sarah.

127
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,367
Come on now.

128
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,740
Because l can't handle it.

129
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,454
What happened wasn't his fault.

130
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,592
He loved you.

131
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,459
He loved...

132
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,734
all of us.

133
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,815
l'm sorry, Mom.

134
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,286
Hey, you guys?

135
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:35,231
l know this has been really tough
on all of us.

136
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,166
What we're going to do
is work together,

137
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,796
and we'll get through it.

138
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,397
Right, Emma?

139
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,464
Right!

140
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,340
- Right?
- Right.

141
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,383
l like sleeping together.

142
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,578
Well, it's just for tonight,

143
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,518
because tomorrow morning
we're going to clean up this place

144
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,853
and then you guys are going
to each have your own room.

145
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,654
That's something you've
never had before, huh?

146
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,420
What about school?

147
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,862
There's one in Addytown.

148
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,399
l talked to them.
You can start late,

149
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,697
you know, after we get
settled in and everything.

150
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,897
With a bunch of demented mountain hicks?

151
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,206
- Mom!
- Good night.

152
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,315
l might have to...

153
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:24,192
check these pipes
down in the basement, miss.

154
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,926
The real estate agent promised
that everything would be working.

155
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,731
Well, l didn't get the call
till last evening to come up here.

156
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,369
This is so frustrating.

157
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,270
l found out yesterday
that we don't have phone service,

158
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,104
and, of course,
my cell phone isn't working.

159
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,166
Sarah!

160
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,179
l'm surprised they even turned
on the electric for you.

161
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,341
- What?
- Oh, l need you to run down

162
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,215
to that store that we stopped at
on the way up here

163
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,482
and get as much
from this list as you can.

164
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,023
Moi?

165
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,387
Mom, look at me.

166
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,517
l've not taken a shower
in two days.

167
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,085
- l'm not going anywhere in public.
- l'll let you drive the car.

168
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,427
To the store and back.

169
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,898
Take it slow.

170
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,502
- Thank you.
- Hey!

171
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,097
- Shut up!
- Butthead.

172
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,905
Doesn't look like this thing's
been working for years.

173
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,744
At least no water's
been run through it.

174
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,784
Ma'am, let me ask you something.

175
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:24,254
Why would you move up here
to these mountains?

176
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,813
lt's really no place to live.

177
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,417
My husband passed away.

178
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,993
Sorry to hear that.

179
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,659
lt was a long illness
and a lot of money.

180
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,600
We didn't have much to start with.

181
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,638
So, after it was over,

182
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:44,642
then all that was left
was this old family house.

183
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,008
l was hoping to fix it--

184
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,470
Yeah.

185
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,689
Who are these children?

186
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,117
What?

187
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,325
These chil--
Who are these children?

188
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,732
There was some kids.

189
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,295
lt was years ago.
They used to work up at the Carlton mine.

190
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,141
l suppose we're through with this thing.

191
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,515
- Who is this?
- What?

192
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:30,816
The man.

193
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,258
Edmund Carlton.

194
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:43,465
He used to own this whole mountain
and everybody on it.

195
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,765
You know, you're going to have
to replace all these pipes.

196
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:46,929
Jesus.

197
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,132
How long is that going to take?

198
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,733
Shouldn't take too long, but l'll--

199
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,711
l'll be out of here by nightfall.

200
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,180
That's for sure.

201
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,452
How many families are left up here?

202
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,252
Well, there's Aaron Hanks.
l still see him

203
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,451
down in Addy
every once in a while.

204
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,926
Then, of course, there's the last

205
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,929
of the Carltons, who--
He doesn't live up here,

206
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,693
but he's been coming around,
buying up all the property--

207
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,564
Maybe he'd want to buy this place.

208
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,159
Maybe.

209
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,832
How l know, he's going
to tear down the Carlton mansion.

210
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,637
Make a hotel out of it.

211
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,338
lt's right down the road from you.

212
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,540
Here, this looks good.

213
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,480
You okay, Emma?

214
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,186
Well, l'm going to check
on my daughter.

215
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,951
Do you need anything, Mr. Thompson?

216
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,184
Maybe like a drink or something?

217
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,988
No, no, l'm fine.

218
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,922
Emma!

219
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,466
Oh, gross.

220
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,728
Go! Get out of here!

221
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,475
Emma, honey, where are you?

222
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,716
Where are you?

223
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,088
Answer me!

224
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,199
Mr. Thompson!

225
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,862
l'll be right back!

226
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,879
How long you planning on staying?

227
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:49,545
Not long, l hope.

228
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,646
Mom's selling the place.

229
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,748
She wants to move to California.

230
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,588
l've never been to California.

231
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,457
l hear it's warm.

232
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,224
The nights are cold here.

233
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,288
Stay inside if l was you.

234
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,856
Out of the woods.

235
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,459
Don't want to get lost.

236
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,505
Thank you.

237
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,800
Freak.

238
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,372
Who's little girl are you?

239
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,203
Definitely not yours.

240
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,475
You can play hard to get, huh?

241
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,076
- l got something hard for you to get.
- Stop it.

242
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,021
ln your dreams.

243
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,859
Hey! What's your name?

244
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,590
Sarah.

245
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,394
l'm Tim.

246
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,197
The idiot's Sean,
and that's Lisa.

247
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,464
Hi.

248
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,233
Where do you live?

249
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,671
Up in the hills.

250
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,199
You're shitting me.
Up with the fucking zombies?

251
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,912
What zombies?

252
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:43,665
Emma! Please answer me!

253
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,754
She's coming.

254
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,243
Hello?

255
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,618
My name is Emma.

256
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,321
What's your name?

257
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,193
Emma!

258
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,470
l'm scared to come in there.

259
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,530
Why can't you come out here?

260
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,378
Are you still there?

261
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,708
Emma!

262
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,310
Don't you ever do that again!

263
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,477
Just wandering off like that,
you scare me half to death!

264
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,851
- You're hurting me, Mommy.
- Look at you. What happened to your knee?

265
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,048
l fell.

266
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,351
Emma, what are you doing out here?

267
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,189
l'm looking for Mary.

268
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,853
She lives in there.

269
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,967
Okay, l don't want you
to ever come out here again.

270
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,333
Do you understand me, Emma?
Never ever.

271
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,134
- Mom!
- Never.

272
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,936
Cross your heart.

273
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,033
Okay.

274
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,337
Oh, baby.

275
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,513
Okay, come on,
let me get you home.

276
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,363
...pray for us sinners

277
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,566
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

278
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,236
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

279
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,903
Blessed art thou among women,

280
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,413
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

281
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,451
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

282
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,418
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

283
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,718
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

284
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,189
Blessed art thou among women

285
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,658
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

286
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,321
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

287
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,729
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

288
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,824
Hail Mary, full of grace...

289
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,413
Mommy, are we lost?

290
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,575
We've been walking
for a really long time.

291
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,817
No, baby.

292
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,517
We're just a little turned around.

293
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,362
lt's okay.

294
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,397
Just the wind.
Nothing to be afraid of.

295
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,098
l'm not.

296
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,663
lt's just Mary and the others.

297
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:23,876
Come on.

298
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,910
Oh, dumb...

299
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,658
Now what happened?

300
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,784
What the hell?

301
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,502
This is not what
l wanted to be doing.

302
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,105
No!

303
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,514
Mommy?

304
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:36,780
l'm getting cold and tired.

305
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,289
l know, baby.

306
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,023
Who lives here?

307
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,591
l don't know, but...

308
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,660
maybe they can help us
find our way home.

309
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,744
There's the paint again, Mom.

310
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,456
Hello?

311
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,231
l don't like it here, Mom.

312
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,597
Me neither, baby.

313
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:58,794
Let's go.

314
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,701
Oh, God!

315
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,109
l'm sorry, you sc--

316
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,435
We were lost,

317
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,776
and your door was open.

318
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,377
Are you the Tunny widow?

319
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,912
Yes.

320
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,517
My name is Hanks.

321
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,087
You hurt yourself, little girl?

322
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,060
l fell.

323
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,867
Been down by the old mine, have you?

324
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,741
You should not have let her play
down by the old mine.

325
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,608
You shouldn't be out
after dark, neither.

326
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,376
Well, l didn't let her
play down there,

327
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,975
and l told you we got lost
on our way home.

328
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,783
Yeah, well, you just follow
the old two track down the mountain.

329
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:55,292
Runs right by your place.

330
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,452
Okay.

331
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,052
Thank you.

332
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,073
Sorry again for the intrusion.

333
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,873
l'll watch your doors for you.

334
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:17,608
l beg your pardon?

335
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,984
ln the day...

336
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,145
Come back, we'll talk then.

337
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:28,047
Emma, stay here for a second.

338
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:33,563
Was that you who...

339
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,065
put the blood on our door?

340
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,900
No need to thank me.

341
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,371
Ought to last you a while.

342
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,836
Look, l don't mean
to be rude, Mr. Hanks,

343
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,475
and l know that...

344
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,952
places like this

345
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,079
have certain customs and all,

346
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,784
but l would appreciate it
if you didn't do what you did last night.

347
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:04,259
Like l said, no need to thank me.

348
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,989
Now get on home now, quick.

349
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,993
Come back in the daylight.

350
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,227
We'll talk.

351
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,099
This Mr. Hanks guy
sounds like a freak.

352
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,907
l liked him.

353
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,809
You would.

354
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,745
Mary likes him, too.

355
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,544
Who's Mary?

356
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,211
My new friend.
l met her in the forest.

357
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,047
Like Frizzy, huh?

358
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,785
Frizzy wasn't real.
Mary is.

359
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,293
Right.

360
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,794
Maybe she's one of the zombies.

361
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,025
The guys l met said
they're ghosts of children

362
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,829
who were buried
in an old mine up here.

363
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,030
They roam the woods at night
and eat little girls like you.

364
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,266
Okay, that's enough.

365
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,005
- Gotta go.
- What, they're not going to come inside?

366
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,104
Please, Mom.
They're cool.

367
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,978
Where are you going?

368
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,644
To Addytown,
to see a movie or something.

369
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,584
Okay. Be home early.

370
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,781
- What's early?
- Oh, like an hour and a half.

371
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:09,348
- Mom!
- l'm kidding. Eleven.

372
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,792
l mean it, okay?

373
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,829
Okay.

374
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,291
What's a zombie, Mom?

375
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,805
lt's nothing.

376
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,464
Finish your dinner.

377
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,981
Good night, baby.
Sleep tight.

378
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,851
Mom, if Mary came here to play,

379
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:42,120
would that be all right?

380
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,661
Well, l don't think she will, honey.

381
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:47,596
But if she did, would it?

382
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,469
Sure.

383
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:56,233
But you have to promise me
to never go near that mine again, okay?

384
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,835
Promise, love you.

385
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,400
l love you more.

386
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,838
The zombies won't eat me, Mom.

387
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,546
No, but l might.

388
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,982
Okay, now you have got
to go to sleep.

389
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,358
Sweet dreams.

390
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,790
The guys l met said
they're ghosts of children who were

391
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,791
buried in an old mine up here.

392
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:42,942
Emma?

393
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,264
These woods kind of creep me out.

394
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,802
The land of the zombie miner geeks.

395
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:44,738
Flesh-eating kids of Carlton.

396
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,243
Stop it you jerk-off.

397
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,711
lt's just urban legend bullshit.

398
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,051
l got to piss...bad.

399
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,467
So, how come you're not in school?

400
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,531
My mother has to get
her shit together first.

401
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,940
She sort of had a nervous freak out
after it all happened.

402
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,210
Were you close to your dad?

403
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,207
Yeah. Real close.

404
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:33,289
l miss him a lot.

405
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,608
Fuck.

406
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,805
You scared the shit
out of me, man!

407
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,348
Wasn't fucking funny.

408
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,941
Fuck.

409
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,282
Come on, guys!
We got to get her home by 1 1 !

410
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,931
Sarah?

411
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,657
Damn it.

412
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,956
Come on, sugar.

413
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,364
We got God's work to do.

414
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:26,156
See you tomorrow?

415
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,588
Yeah.

416
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,521
l mean, sure.

417
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,827
Look, Tim, thank you--

418
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,972
l got to go.

419
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,140
See you tomorrow.

420
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,380
- Bye.
- Bye.

421
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,716
Bye.

422
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,368
Did you have a good time?

423
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,567
Yeah, l did.

424
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,542
He was nice.

425
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,710
What's wrong?

426
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,450
l found some...

427
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:32,250
old photographs of your father

428
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,119
and his family in the basement.

429
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:43,757
Wow.

430
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,996
Look how young he was.

431
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,610
How old were you guys
when you first met?

432
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,558
We were 16.

433
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:18,462
Then l got married at 1 7.

434
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,275
l had you at 18.

435
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,108
Fast worker, huh?

436
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,652
lt must be weird to find all this stuff

437
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,625
about his family.

438
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,089
Yeah.

439
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,796
l didn't really know...

440
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,733
anything about them.

441
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,378
You know what he was like
every time we brought it up, l mean...

442
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,444
they just refused
to talk about him.

443
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,485
l didn't even know
they lived in Pennsylvania

444
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,585
until l found the deed
for this house in his papers.

445
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,935
lt's like they were this secret.

446
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,500
Mom!

447
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,911
The water stopped working!

448
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,882
l'll check on it!

449
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,851
Thank you.

450
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,016
Oh, God.

451
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:40,767
Harold ain't answering his phone.

452
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,869
Must be out on a job.

453
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,709
You guys have to have
another plumber somewhere, right?

454
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,612
- There's one down in Hemet.
- Okay.

455
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,583
Let me see if l can find his number.

456
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,517
- He's more expensive.
- l don't even care.

457
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,884
l need what's on this list.

458
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,583
- Put it all on my account.
- Excuse me.

459
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,421
l'll be back after lunch.
Have it ready then.

460
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,256
l was kind of in the middle
of something he--

461
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:02,456
Who the hell was that rude bastard?

462
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,160
William Carlton.

463
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,861
He lives here?

464
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,029
No. The old Carlton mansion's in ruins.

465
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,801
He's up here surveying the land.

466
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,001
Gonna build a fancy ski resort.

467
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,852
You okay, Emma?

468
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,759
You seem quiet today.

469
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:39,527
Mary said she wouldn't hurt you,

470
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,332
but she doesn't know about the others.

471
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,265
When did you see Mary again?

472
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,038
Last night.

473
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,545
She stayed in my room.

474
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,275
She likes to sleep in my bed.

475
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,249
lt used to be hers.

476
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:02,180
When l made her bed,
there was this spot on the mattress.

477
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:08,427
l mean, it looks like someone
was sleeping here before we came.

478
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,159
So what are you saying?

479
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,666
This Mary chick is not

480
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,499
another one of Miss Weirdo's
imaginary friends like Frizzy?

481
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,938
She actually lives in the mines
with the other zombie freaks?

482
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,875
l know, it's crazy.

483
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,572
l don't even know
what l'm saying anymore.

484
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,649
Hell, l don't even know
what l'm doing half the time.

485
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,859
God, l keep on forgetting.
The water doesn't work again.

486
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,528
l can't believe the stupid plumber
can't come until tomorrow.

487
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,622
Quit your whining.

488
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,758
At least you got a bath today.

489
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,898
Half a bath, Mother.

490
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:04,342
Honey?

491
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:08,350
Are you okay?

492
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,623
Mary doesn't like to live
in there anymore.

493
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,492
She wants to come home.

494
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:19,694
Where did you get the doll?

495
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,464
Mary gave it to me.

496
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,563
Emma! Stop it.
Where did you really find it?

497
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,609
l told you! Mary gave it to me,
and l gave her Teddy.

498
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:27,904
Yeah!

499
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,809
Take a look here!

500
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,384
All right, let me grab a flashlight!

501
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,178
Sarah!

502
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:49,930
- What?
- Watch your sister.

503
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,831
l'll be right back!

504
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,085
We're going to have to blow out
the interior on that.

505
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,530
Take a look at those plans again.

506
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,867
l'll get them.

507
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,403
Hello?

508
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,209
ls anybody here?

509
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,751
Mr. Carlton?

510
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,412
Hello.

511
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:22,245
Oh, l'm sorry, l was--

512
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:24,776
l heard voices.

513
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:25,878
And?

514
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:30,390
And l was told the Carlton home
was around here.

515
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,688
And?

516
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:37,097
And l was wondering if it was you.

517
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,499
Well, now you know.

518
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,697
This is private land.
You're not supposed to be here.

519
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,907
My name is Karen Tunny.

520
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,210
l live nearby.

521
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,649
The old Tunny place, huh?

522
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,743
Yeah.

523
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,687
l'll give you two weeks to vacate it.

524
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,815
So you want to buy it?

525
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:03,214
l already own it.

526
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,585
l own everything
from here to Addytown.

527
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,654
No, l own it.

528
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,097
l inherited it.
l have a deed.

529
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,396
You have a miner's deed, a lease.

530
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,334
All rights to the land are mine.

531
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,393
Everything on it.

532
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,669
Animal, mineral, wood, brick, mine.

533
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:21,870
l'll give you and the others
two weeks to clear out.

534
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,907
You can tell Hanks to stop this nonsense
with the dead animals.

535
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,918
He doesn't scare anyone
with his old stories.

536
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,784
lf l catch him doing it again,
l'll have him arrested.

537
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,324
Russell, let's go.

538
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:40,687
He's right.

539
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:42,561
He owns it all.

540
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,530
How can that be?

541
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:50,698
Just is.

542
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:53,538
Well, we'll get lawyers,
and we'll fight it.

543
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,441
Suit yourself.

544
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:59,141
The only way you're going
to get title is if he dies.

545
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,683
He's last in the Carlton line.

546
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,083
He dies...

547
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,054
and the land goes
to the miner's deed.

548
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,714
That's how it works.

549
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:12,260
There was a dead pig.

550
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,228
A carcass.

551
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,821
He said you did it.

552
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:22,402
Every night they come for redemption.

553
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,464
For his blood.

554
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:28,306
The evil he did made them
what they are,

555
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,879
and they hunger.

556
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,943
What if we have to move
like this guy says?

557
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:41,650
We won't, don't worry.

558
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,454
This is our home
and no one can make us move.

559
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:57,899
l won't go out tonight
if you don't want me to.

560
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,499
Oh, no, baby, go out.
Have fun with your friends in Addytown.

561
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,274
Thanks, Mom.

562
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,177
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

563
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:19,156
Oh, my God.

564
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,688
We're going into Addytown.
We'll be back in a few hours.

565
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,425
See you then.

566
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,948
Where have l seen you before?

567
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,657
lt's a major bummer
if that fucker kicks you out.

568
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,894
l was just starting to like you, bitch.

569
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,266
Turn it up.
l love that song.

570
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,739
lt can't be.

571
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:42,398
Mr. Carlton?

572
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,032
ls that you, Russell?

573
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,886
What the hell are you two doing--

574
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,325
What the hell was that?

575
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:45,559
lt's just the wind.

576
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,197
l don't hear any wind.

577
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:53,606
Me, neither.

578
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:57,545
Holy shit!

579
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,875
Let's get the fuck out of here.

580
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,609
lt's nothing.

581
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,082
Look, l'll prove it.

582
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,846
No!

583
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,285
Would you fucking chill?

584
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:12,224
Close the damn door!

585
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,337
lf you ever want to get
in my pants again,

586
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,711
you better start the car
and get my ass out of here right now!

587
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,524
Sean, do you hear me?

588
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,895
Sean!

589
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,178
You asshole!

590
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,843
Got you.

591
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,757
Not funny, Sean.

592
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,324
Would you get in here
and let's go?

593
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,268
He's such a dick.

594
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,965
You're freaking the girls out!

595
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,942
l'm going to leave
your ass, l mean it.

596
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,147
Start the engine.

597
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,344
He's probably just pissing again.

598
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:44,443
l don't care.

599
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,784
Take off and make him come running.

600
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,367
Oh, Goddamn it!

601
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:07,735
What's wrong?

602
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:13,739
We're stuck.

603
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,559
Come on, Sean,
we got to dig the bird out!

604
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:41,438
Give it some gas when l push it!

605
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,341
You know l can't drive!

606
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,004
l can!

607
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,448
Okay!

608
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,587
Now!

609
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,021
Shit!

610
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:07,796
lt's not working!

611
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,131
Again!

612
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,205
Fuck! Fuck!

613
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:22,411
Come on, Sean!

614
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,786
Tim. Tim!

615
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,003
Go! Go! Go!

616
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:56,067
Lisa!

617
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,518
lt's not happening!

618
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:13,892
lt didn't happen!

619
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,931
lt didn't fucking happen!

620
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,293
Mom!

621
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,395
- Sarah, what happened?
- Mom, they're for real!

622
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,906
- What are you talking about? Who's for real?
- The fucking children!

623
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:28,102
- Stop it, Sarah. l am sick of--
- Mom!

624
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,611
lt's not fucking urban legend.
We have to get out of here now!

625
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,306
lt was so horrible.

626
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,440
- Emma!
- How can they be for real?

627
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,849
How could they be alive, Mom?
We have to get out of here!

628
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,853
l am not going anywhere without Emma!

629
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:41,947
- Emma?
- Emma!

630
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:57,165
They're out here, Mom.

631
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,173
So is Emma.

632
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,038
Where are we going?

633
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,578
Back to the mine.

634
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,137
That's where l found her the first time,

635
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:08,012
and it's where she met Mary.

636
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:13,951
lt's who gave Emma the doll.

637
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,888
l saw her photo in one
of the family albums,

638
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,119
and her and her brother
Ryan were Tunnys.

639
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:24,295
They were two of the kids
that were buried in the mine accident.

640
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:31,598
How did this happen?

641
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,074
How can it be for real?

642
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:46,453
l don't know.

643
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,387
There has to be some explanation,

644
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,687
but l don't know.

645
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:53,489
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

646
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:56,224
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb--

647
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,927
Jesus.

648
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:13,312
Emma!

649
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:19,417
Emma?

650
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,547
They could be anywhere out here.

651
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:02,790
Maybe we should go back
and get some help.

652
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,095
l am not leaving
my baby out here!

653
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,965
Mom, this is insane!

654
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,766
You can't believe what they did.

655
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,567
They had these hammers
and picks and--

656
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,040
lt's going to be okay!

657
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,043
We are going to get out of this!

658
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,544
l'm sorry.

659
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,914
Look, we're just going
to find your sister.

660
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:26,751
Okay, and everything's
going to be okay.

661
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,832
Emma!

662
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,734
This is it.

663
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,381
This is the creek.

664
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,616
lt's down this way.

665
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,713
Right around here.

666
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,657
This is where l found her the first time.

667
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,094
We can't go in there.

668
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:43,688
We have to.

669
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:44,926
What if they're in there, Mom?

670
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,024
Then stay here.

671
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:47,193
No fucking way!

672
01:11:58,013 --> 01:11:59,674
Emma?

673
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:06,216
lt's okay.

674
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,383
Emma, are you in here?

675
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,384
Mom?

676
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:42,890
What if Emma's dead?

677
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,119
Don't you say that!

678
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,493
Don't you ever say that again.
She's fine!

679
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,055
We're going to--
We're going to...

680
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,124
find her, and everything's
going to be fine.

681
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,599
Damn it!

682
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,108
Mom, l can hardly see anything!

683
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:02,609
Just don't move!

684
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:07,475
What is it?

685
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,540
lt's a hand, Mama!

686
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,956
lt looked like a hand.
l swear!

687
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:33,801
Shit.

688
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,570
Mom?

689
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,478
What--

690
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:24,384
What?

691
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:28,828
Run.

692
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,831
Where?

693
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:35,227
With me, run!

694
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:43,834
Where are we going?

695
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:46,244
The old man's house
is this way!

696
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:09,594
Mom!

697
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,031
Get up!

698
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:13,074
l can't.

699
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:14,130
Yes, you can. Get up!

700
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:15,437
l can't run anymore!

701
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,604
Get on your feet and run, Sarah!

702
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,562
The road's right up here.

703
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:48,772
- Help us!
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

704
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:50,539
You almost got yourself killed!

705
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:52,671
We need to get out of here.
They're after us!

706
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:55,216
Get out of my car.
What the hell do you think you're doing?

707
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:56,717
Just drive and l'll explain!

708
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:59,276
You're getting mud all over my car.
Now get out!

709
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:02,050
The children are going to kill us all
unless you get out of here!

710
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:05,025
- Now go!
- What the hell are you talking about?

711
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,168
Mommy!

712
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:37,314
Go!

713
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:40,486
Who the fuck are those kids?

714
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:41,688
Ask him.

715
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,398
Why are they doing this?

716
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,438
They can't be real.

717
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:05,412
They're fucking real enough to me.

718
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:06,749
Hey!

719
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:08,881
Just stop right here!

720
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,517
You come any closer,
and l'm going to start doing some damage!

721
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,953
Son of a bitch.

722
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,697
Keep moving!

723
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,802
What the fuck do we do now?

724
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,707
l can't shoot a kid.

725
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:33,177
They're already dead.

726
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:42,345
Holy shit.

727
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:04,305
Mr. Hanks.

728
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:10,718
Are you there?

729
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,525
Oh, God.
Oh, thank you.

730
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,597
How far are they behind you?

731
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,731
On the road.

732
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:36,003
What are you doing out at night?

733
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,807
l warned you.

734
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:41,781
My Emma...
she's gone missing,

735
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,148
and l think she's with
the one named Mary.

736
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:47,719
lf you're lucky,
they won't hurt her.

737
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:52,621
Blood they know,
blood of their kin.

738
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:54,423
All others are fair game.

739
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:01,233
That's why the blood on the doors...

740
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:04,761
to mark them.

741
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,171
We're safe here.

742
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,402
No.

743
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:09,967
They're animals.

744
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:12,605
There's no telling what they'll do
when you get them riled up

745
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:16,139
and you ain't got Tunny blood.

746
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:18,652
lf they haven't killed her already,

747
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,587
she'll be back by daylight.

748
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,055
They only feed at night.

749
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,852
We're all going to die, aren't we?

750
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,897
Like l said,

751
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:32,331
depends on how much
you got them riled up.

752
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,861
They already killed three of my friends.

753
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,400
And maybe William Carlton, too.

754
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,237
How do you know that?

755
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,281
Let me in.

756
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:52,377
lt's him.

757
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,944
He's alive. Let him in.

758
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:55,781
Why?

759
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:57,848
Because they'll kill him if you don't.

760
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:00,187
Eye for an eye.

761
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:03,921
You want him dead, don't you?

762
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:06,490
Hanks?

763
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:08,263
Open the Goddamn door, or l will.

764
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:11,396
You open that door, we will die.

765
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,868
Open the fucking door!

766
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,577
Hanks?

767
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,481
They ate him.

768
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,989
From where l was hiding,

769
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:40,967
l...could see...

770
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:43,760
them...

771
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,768
tear pieces from him and--

772
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:53,903
You're a pretty thing.

773
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:55,244
You were in my car, weren't you?

774
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:56,750
He's crazy!

775
01:20:56,818 --> 01:20:58,843
Hell, yes, l'm crazy!
They fucking ate him!

776
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,945
Shut up!

777
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:02,922
Your truck, does it run?

778
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:05,118
Sometimes.

779
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,717
An hour until sunrise.

780
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:08,490
lf we can just get to your truck.

781
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,064
Don't let them get me.

782
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:20,367
You ain't gonna kill 'em!

783
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,740
You ain't even gonna hurt 'em!

784
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:25,245
But you can sure as hell
slow him down with that thing!

785
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,848
They're crazy for him!

786
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:30,782
This ain't gonna stop!

787
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,012
Out the front door.

788
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,113
You open, and l'll clear the way.

789
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:38,820
Sarah.

790
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:39,986
Ready, Mom.

791
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,392
Now! Do it now!

792
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,631
Go! Get out of here!

793
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:13,322
Well, come on, Mr. Hanks!

794
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:22,695
Shit!

795
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,575
Son of a bitch!

796
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:41,048
Come on!

797
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:44,155
Go! Go! Go!

798
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:47,589
Come on!

799
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:55,132
Goddamn it!

800
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:43,116
Why are they stopping?

801
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:47,480
Carlton?

802
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,546
You come up here, l'll kill you!

803
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:51,285
l'll kill all of you. l mean it!

804
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:24,124
Don't move. Not a muscle.

805
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,491
You move and there's no telling
what they're gonna do.

806
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,668
What's going on down there?

807
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:42,598
Who's down there?

808
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,121
lt's him they want.

809
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,454
lf you and your kids want
to get out of here alive,

810
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,550
you'll let them have him.

811
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:01,484
They'll kill him.

812
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:05,457
As you sow, so shall you reap.

813
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:35,856
Hanks?

814
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:37,227
ls that you?

815
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:17,126
Mom!

816
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:38,984
Mom!

817
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,730
Emma?

818
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:51,596
Oh, God, Emma.

819
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:53,025
Oh, God, baby.

820
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,899
They won't hurt you, Mommy.

821
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:58,336
They won't hurt anyone anymore.

822
01:27:58,406 --> 01:27:59,873
They promise.

823
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:07,006
l thought l lost you.

824
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:09,379
l was just playing with Mary.

825
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:13,147
She hasn't had anyone to play with
in a very long time.

826
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:19,555
Oh, God.

827
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:47,853
l still don't understand
why we didn't sell the house.

828
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:49,651
How are we going to get the money?

829
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:51,692
Well, we have enough
to make it through.

830
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:53,351
At least until l get a job.

831
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:58,029
We're going to be okay, you guys.

832
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:00,659
Promise.

833
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:02,635
Do you think anyone's
ever going to find out

834
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:05,104
about what really happened?

835
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:08,040
Mr. Hanks took care
of all of the loose ends.

836
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,371
Well, l know, but what--

837
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:10,433
Sarah.

838
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:15,614
A lot of strange things happen
up in those hills.

839
01:29:17,652 --> 01:29:20,348
People go missing all the time.

840
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:22,082
After a while,

841
01:29:22,156 --> 01:29:24,716
everyone will forget about it.

842
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:26,225
Just like the last time.

843
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:30,426
l'm glad we didn't sell the house, Mom.

844
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:35,535
Me, too, baby.

845
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,505
Me, too.

846
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:06,162
