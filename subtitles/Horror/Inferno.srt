NEW YORK - AVRIL

00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,389
<i>Three Mothers.</i></i>

5
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,620
<i>I am unaware of which is the 
price to pay to have broken</i></i>

6
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,789
<i>what we them alchemists
 call</i> Silent.</i>

7
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,959
<i>The experiment of the life teaches us not to accept</i></i>

8
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,378
<i>a work without knowing the consequences of them.</i></i>

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>Me, Varelli, architect living in London,</i></i>

10
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>I met the Three Mothers, and drew to them</i></i>

11
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:54,763
<i>and built three houses. In Rome, in New York</i></i>

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,349
<i>and the third in Freiburg, in Germany .</i></i>

13
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,726
<i>But I discovered too late</i></i>

14
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,520
<i>that from these places,</i></i>

15
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,273
<i>the Three Mothers control the world in the pain,</i></i>

16
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,108
<i>tears and darkness.</i></i>

17
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,111
<i>Mater Suspiriorum,
the Mother of the Sighs</i></i>

18
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>and oldest, lives in Freiburg.</i></i>

19
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,950
<i>MATER Lacrimarum, 
the Mother of the Sobs</i></i>

20
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,120
<i>and most beautiful from the three, 
Rome directs.</i></i>

21
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,540
<i>MATER Tenebrarum, the Mother of Darkness,</i></i>

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,836
<i>young person and cruelest, 
New York control.</i></i>

23
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,381
<i>I built these horrible residences,</i></i>

24
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,551
<i>agent of these wretched secrecies.</i></i>

25
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,971
<i>These alleged "Mothers" are in fact malefic,</i></i>

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,223
<i>incompetents to create the life...</i></i>

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,651
<i>The men gave them a name 
single and terrifying.</i></i>

28
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,697
<i>Actually, all three were saeurs 
as much as mothers.</i></i>

29
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,700
<i>But also three Muses, three Graces,</i></i>

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,827
<i>three destinies and three furies.</i></i>

31
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,789
<i>The ground on which these 
residences were builts</i></i>

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,751
<i>could become mortal and pestiféré.</i></i>

33
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,879
<i>So that the neighbourhoods would be touched by it.</i></i>

34
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,049
<i>This is the first key of the secrecy
 of the Three Mothers.</i></i>

35
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,468
<i>A key of first importance.</i></i>

36
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:18,722
<i>The second key of the poisoned secrecy of the Three Saeurs</i></i>

37
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,808
<i>is hidden in the cellar of their house.</i></i>

38
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,770
<i>There, you will find the portrait and the name</i></i>

39
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,855
<i>sœur which lives the house.</i></i>

40
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,526
<i>It is the place where the second key is.</i></i>

41
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:34,988
<i>The third key is under the sole of your shoes.</i></i>

42
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,200
<i>There is the third key..</i></i>

43
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,438
<i>My dear Marc brother...</i></i>

44
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,323
<i>The second key is hidden in the cellar.</i></i>

45
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,933
Good evening.

46
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,519
I would like to speak to you
about this book.

47
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,396
Which?

48
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,025
That that you sold to me, 
<i>Three Mothers</i>.</i>

49
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,903
You read it ?

50
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,739
Partly..

51
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:31,248
This is an invention
or a history drawn from real facts ?

52
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,959
It disturbs you ?

53
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,921
It is not that a book
written by an alchemist .

54
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:42,551
There are many accounts
on the cursed houses...

55
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,180
The House of the Monsters,
close to Palermo.

56
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,515
The House of Pheasants,
in Brussels.

57
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,143
The Cellender House,
in France.

58
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,105
 Certaines people 
 thinks that these books are a fiction

59
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,066
 and others believe each word of it.

60
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:02,779
 the women are generally 
 the worst readers for these accounts.  Or the best, if you prefer.

61
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,579
 - They want to believe absolument.
 in it - Not really.

62
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:14,500
 the book speaks about an unpleasant odor, 
 for example.

63
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,630
 And here, around, 
 there is this strange bitter soft odor.

64
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,591
 One says that it comes 
 factory from cakes.

65
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,385
 I always knew it.

66
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,012
 It disturbs you?

67
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,139
 At the end of one moment, one made there,

68
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,849
 and one does not notice it even more.

69
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,352
 It is not only coincidence.

70
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,189
 - When one reads the book... 
 - There are mysterious passages.  But only the true mystery

71
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,279
 is that our lives 
 are controlled by deaths.

72
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,657
 Good night.

73
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,390
 the second key 
 is hidden in the cellar.

74
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,261
 ROME - APRIL

75
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:54,139
 And here celebrates it ch?ur 
 Goes pensiero.

76
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,350
 Final...

77
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,688
 Third part...

78
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,821
 of Nabucco de Giuseppe Made green.

79
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,372
 My dear Marc brother...

80
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:47,127
 As you know it, in New York, 
 I live an old building...

81
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,462
 Excuse me, I want to go elsewhere.

82
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,508
 "Via dei Bagni", with number 49.

83
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:50,037
 What a strange odor! 
 This street empeste.

84
00:22:58,837 --> 00:22:59,922
 STREET OF The BATHS

85
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:03,717
 PHILOSOPHICAL LIBRARY 
 FOUNDATION ABERTNY

86
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,177
 OPENED WITH The PUBLIC

87
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,149
 - A Problem? 
 - Not.

88
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:31,240
 - You seek something? 
 - Not... Yes.

89
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:35,577
 - I seek a book ancien.
 - Of which book does it act?

90
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,248
 Three Mothers... 
Yes, Three Mothers.

91
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:42,960
 It must be here, 
 just behind you.

92
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,717
 Thank you.

93
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,829
 This book is neither a fiction, 
 nor the fruit of my imagination.

94
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:22,666
 It partly takes again 
 the newspaper which I discovered

95
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,918
 among the personal businesses 
 of a friend,

96
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,130
 an architect and alchemist recognized

97
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,798
 of the name of Varelli.

98
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:34,261
 Varelli disappeared mysteriously 
 here several years.

99
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,897
 This newspaper 
 could help to clear up

100
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,107
 the circumstances of its death.

101
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:51,612
 As it was in Latin, 
 I decided to publish it just as it is.

102
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:53,488
 Sarah!

103
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,012
 Closing.

104
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,748
 Mister?

105
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:24,890
 Excusez me...

106
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:31,688
 Mister... excuse me.

107
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,026
 I do not find the exit.

108
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,819
 the other carries.

109
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:01,051
 the book!

110
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:22,966
 Which stage?

111
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,012
 the fourth.

112
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:56,083
 can I help you?

113
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,210
 I am afraid...

114
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,547
 I am afraid to remain alone.

115
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:06,218
 Well, I do not have anything to make 
 during the hours come.

116
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,345
 I can remain with you 
 if you want.

117
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,769
 That you make, Sarah? 
 You study or you work?

118
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:18,856
 I study the musique.
 And you?

119
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:22,109
 I am a sporting commentator 
 for television.

120
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,070
 can I ask you 
 a strange question?

121
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:26,822
 Strange how?

122
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:30,409
 did you already intend to speak 
des Three S?urs?

123
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,411
 black singers?

124
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:36,290
 Not, I speak about mythology... 
 the Trinity.

125
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,127
 Attendez, if you speak about phantoms, 
 I do not believe in it.

126
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:43,839
 - How can you be so sure for it? 
 - I do not believe in it, it is all.

127
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:46,049
 Not need to philosophize.

128
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,676
 And in what do you believe?

129
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:50,429
 In all that I can voir
et touch.

130
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:05,986
 You know without doute.
 It is Suits it pensiero of Made green.

131
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:57,913
 Hello, Marc? 
 I found the letter of your s?ur.

132
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,790
 You left it at the University.

133
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:03,585
 You read it? 
 You must read it, it is important.

134
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,755
 Viens quickly at home, 
 that I tell you what arrived to me.

135
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:45,669
 That does it occur?

136
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:49,047
 I do not know, 
 perhaps an overpressure.

137
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,009
 Carlo!

138
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,430
 Where is the fuse box?

139
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,850
 In the remise.
 the door at the bottom of the corridor.

140
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:04,479
 - do not go there pas.
 - That goes, I check just the fuses.

141
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,900
 Of agreement, but continue to speak 
 so that I know where you are.

142
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,276
 Of agreement.

143
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:34,801
 Carlo... Where are you?

144
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,429
 In the remise.
 I found the fuse box.

145
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,350
 I come. I am afraid. is

146
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,612
 Carlo, what there?

147
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,823
 It is good, I believe that it is repaired.

148
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,209
 Sarah?

149
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:35,839
 Sarah?

150
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,220
 Sarah, it is Marc.

151
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:58,487
 the third key is 
 under the sole of your shoes.

152
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:28,327
 - You know what arrived? 
 - I do not know. It had already died.

153
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:36,001
 You hear me? It is Marc.

154
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:40,506
 Speaks more extremely, Rose.
 I hear you badly.

155
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:45,552
 - You received my letter? 
 - Yes, but I did not read it yet.

156
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:48,805
 - Why? 
 - It arrived full with things.

157
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:54,520
 Hello... I do not understand anything.

158
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,276
 I do not hear you pas.
Je do not include/understand anything.

159
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,486
 That is there, Rose?

160
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:07,449
 - Promise to me to quickly come 
 - Of course, I will come...

161
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:26,552
 New York 
 the SAME NIGHT From APRIL

162
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:20,067
 Range that to the usual place.

163
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:23,487
 - Excuse-moi.
 - Yes?

164
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:25,447
 I am Marc Elliot, 
 the brother of Rose.

165
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:27,783
 Oh, yes!

166
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:32,496
 Apartment 45, fourth stage.

167
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:34,998
 If you want to go up, 
 I have a double of the keys.

168
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,253
 You come or not?

169
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:47,302
 Quatrième stages on the left.

170
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:52,391
 It is the brother of Miss Elliot.
 He has just arrived from Rome.

171
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,309
 Ah, Italy!

172
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:17,291
 It would like to speak to you.

173
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:20,169
 It does that when it wants to say 
 something.

174
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:24,548
 It is professor Arnold.
 He is sick since years.

175
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,558
 - And you, whom you make? 
 - I study... Musicology.

176
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,188
 Marvellous! 
 A professor of toxicology.

177
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,731
 We know that them...

178
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:42,941
 Non, not of toxicology, 
 of musicology.

179
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:44,610
 That does not have any relationship with medicine.

180
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:45,819
 Which is this thus, then?

181
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:49,406
 the study of the music.

182
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:53,368
 Your s?ur makes 
 singular studies too.

183
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,120
 Singular? 
 Not, she writes poetry.

184
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:59,541
 Yes, an ideal pastime 
 for the women.

185
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,293
 Goodbye.

186
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:12,317
 - It was you? 
 - Yes, I sought Rose.

187
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:14,486
 I saw light 
 and I thought that it had returned.

188
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,947
Je I am a amie.
 live above.

189
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:19,950
 Rose is not rentrée.
 I am his Marc brother.

190
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:23,912
 How you do that? 
 Your voice seemed to come from everywhere.

191
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,999
C' is a thing which one discovered 
 with your s?ur.

192
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:29,459
 It is our small secret.
 Regardez by here.

193
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:33,380
 You see this hole in the wall?

194
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:35,883
 There is too 
 in my apartment.

195
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,719
 That joined the piping 
 of all the apartments.

196
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:42,097
Quand one speaks inside, 
 the voice is amplified.

197
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:45,601
 This old building is full 
 secrecies with this kind.

198
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:54,318
 - Want you to enter? 
 - Of agreement, but not a long time.

199
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:03,619
 Not, do not close, 
 somebody will come to seek me.

200
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,997
 I am called Elise Delon Van Adler.

201
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:09,750
 That made five years 
 which I only live here.

202
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:12,920
 My husband travels much 
 for his work.

203
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:16,757
 I cannot accompany it bus... 
 I am not very well.

204
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:35,108
C' is étrange.
 Rose knew that I came.

205
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:38,779
 I thought that it awaited me.

206
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:40,197
 I do not include/understand why 
 it did not return yet.

207
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:44,660
 Which kind of people live 
 in a building like this one?

208
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:49,289
 It does not have many occupants.
 there the majority of the apartments are empty.

209
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,670
 Y does it have somebody of private individual?

210
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:59,550
 Rose spoke about something 
 in a letter.

211
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:03,679
 I know that this building belonged 
 to an old fortunate eccentric.

212
00:55:04,221 --> 00:55:05,639
 They condemned it after its death,

213
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:08,559
 then a company 
 of investment repurchased.

214
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:11,353
 Which is Kazanian?

215
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,690
 It sells books and antiquities 
 in a shop at side.

216
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:17,192
 Rose buys 
 strange books much there.

217
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:18,527
 And it...

218
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,827
 Excuse me.

219
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,329
 One requires of you with the telephone, Madam.

220
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:33,000
 Very well, I arrive.
 At tomorrow, Marc.

221
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:45,929
 You are wounded?

222
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:48,432
 Not, it is painting, 
 not blood.

223
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:35,205
 Which is there?

224
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:50,429
 Which is there?

225
00:58:06,612 --> 00:58:07,613
 Shit!

226
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:11,658
 Cursed cats! was

227
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:25,422
 Which the amount, this time?

228
00:58:27,299 --> 00:58:29,218
 the first was 250 Mg.

229
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,428
 the second of 400 Mg.

230
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:35,641
 It is the maximum amount.

231
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:41,897
 - Must I prepare your bath? 
 - Thank you.

232
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:36,493
 Of blood...

233
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:49,840
 Your bath is ready, Madam.

234
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:53,510
 Good night, at tomorrow.

235
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,638
 Good night, you rest well.

236
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:27,669
 I slipped on blood.

237
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,005
 did you notice 
 that the handle of the door is broken?

238
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,089
 Yes, I saw.

239
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:32,591
 Écoutez...

240
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:36,470
 be delirious Them of Rose 
 always worried me.

241
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:39,097
 Its nervousness, its fear of death.

242
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:41,850
 the myth of the Three Mothers.

243
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:43,685
 It is what?

244
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:46,897
 It A has obsession.
 Three Latin names.

245
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:51,527
 MATER Suspiriorum, 
la Mother of the Sighs.

246
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:54,988
 MATER Lacrimarum, 
la Mother of the Tears.

247
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:59,243
 And MATER Tenebrarum, 
 the Mother of Darkness.

248
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:01,370
 Rose read an old book 
 on their subject.

249
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:04,581
 It speaks about it 
 as if it were a true story.

250
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:07,459
 Rose thinks that one of the habitants
de this building...

251
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:10,796
 Non... I can you to it expliquer.
 It will speak better only me to you.

252
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:13,298
 These things strange and impossible...

253
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:17,970
 It is convinced that this building 
 with a bond with these Three Mothers.

254
01:01:18,846 --> 01:01:21,223
 It spoke about an architect, 
 Marelli or Varelli.

255
01:01:21,557 --> 01:01:24,977
 an Italian name, 
 I do not know if there is a report/ratio.

256
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:28,689
 I begin me too 
 to be disturbed and nervous.

257
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:31,441
 I have the feeling 
 constantly to be épiée.

258
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:34,153
 Sometimes, I feel 
 like a presence.

259
01:01:34,486 --> 01:01:36,488
 Y does it have somebody in the part 
 with me?

260
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:38,407
 I suppose that the doctor...

261
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,669
 - you heard this laughter? 
 - Which laughter?

262
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:53,547
 I do not know. One would have said...

263
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:54,840
 You were right!

264
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:58,802
 There is blood.

265
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:00,262
 Come to see.

266
01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:13,650
 - Where carries out this door? 
 - With the service entrance.

267
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:15,319
 But nobody uses it.

268
01:02:16,528 --> 01:02:20,365
 Somebody made recently, 
 I will see. You come?

269
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:23,160
 Not, I await ici.
 I am afraid.

270
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:29,578
 Marc, where are you?

271
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:56,021
 Marc, answer me.

272
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,506
 Open the door, please!

273
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:15,220
 Help me... My c?ur...

274
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:19,850
 It says that it is its c?ur.

275
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:24,813
 Alors it needs a drug 
 for the c?ur.

276
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,616
 this, you Drink will be better.

277
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:47,419
 My s?ur Rose... where is it?

278
01:08:48,962 --> 01:08:51,256
 Pourquoi didn't it return?

279
01:08:52,299 --> 01:08:54,801
 Let us bring it in the apartment.

280
01:08:57,221 --> 01:08:58,639
 Where is it?

281
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:36,820
 Elects, it is Marc 
 You hear me?

282
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:39,907
 Elects, it is Marc.

283
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:47,206
 Elects, it is Marc.

284
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:59,009
 It is feeling reluctant! 
 There is dozen of them.

285
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:01,261
 They enter my shop.

286
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:05,599
 Yesterday evening, I was scratched 
 and a statue of value was broken.

287
01:11:05,891 --> 01:11:09,686
 I warn you, 
 it is the last time.

288
01:11:09,812 --> 01:11:11,522
 the next one, I will go to the police force.

289
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:13,482
 Or with the medical inspection.

290
01:11:13,816 --> 01:11:18,320
 I do not want to see any more 
 only one of these cursed cats here.

291
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:21,281
 As you will want, Mr Kazanian.

292
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:26,745
 Bonjour.
 You seem to better be, Mr. Elliot.

293
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:29,081
 Yes, I do not even remember 
 the evening of yesterday.

294
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:30,999
 You do not combine bien.
 It was your c?ur.

295
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:34,086
 - But I do not have a problème.
 - We gave you a remedy.

296
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:37,923
 - Which is this man? 
 - It is Kazanian, the antique dealer.

297
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:41,009
 - Thank you, for yesterday aussi.
 - Of nothing.

298
01:11:43,637 --> 01:11:44,972
 Mr Kazanian!

299
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:45,889
 Yes?

300
01:11:45,889 --> 01:11:48,517
 I am called Marc Elliot, 
 the brother of Rose. You know it?

301
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,353
 - It took livres.
 to me - You know it well?

302
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:53,063
 Not, why?

303
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:54,898
 One 
 for two days and...

304
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:58,485
 - I just sold livres.
 to him - Which kind of books has not seen it?

305
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:02,072
 Of old works, this kind of things.

306
01:12:02,531 --> 01:12:06,410
 If you do not find it, 
 made what people usually do.

307
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:07,452
 What, for example?

308
01:12:08,162 --> 01:12:11,081
 A ppelez the hospitals, or organizes it.

309
01:12:11,248 --> 01:12:13,458
 I already did it and that did not give anything. does

310
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:15,252

311
01:12:15,252 --> 01:12:17,462
 "the key is under the sole 
 of your shoes".

312
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:19,047
 is this a riddle?

313
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:21,341
 I do not like the riddles.

314
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:28,932
 Since when are you there?

315
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:30,559
 Since yesterday.

316
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:33,520
 You know what?

317
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:36,899
 There will be a moon eclipse this evening.

318
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:38,358
 Not, I did not know.

319
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:43,989
 That made 46 years that there no was 
 total eclipse.

320
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,868
 I heard that with television 
 it there not very a long time.

321
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:52,581
 Look at, it will be interesting for it.

322
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:56,543
 - Of agreement, I it ferai.
 - You will like.

323
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,518
 - Goodbye, Mr. Elliot.
 - Goodbye.

324
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:48,262
 Te here!

325
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,438
 Nice cat.

326
01:14:04,403 --> 01:14:05,863
 Come here!

327
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:24,339
 You do not want to leave?

328
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:09,273
 My crutch!

329
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:15,028
 I have it!

330
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:28,458
 With the assistance!

331
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:03,702
 With the assistance!

332
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:32,189
 Help me!

333
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:50,791
 Help me!

334
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:52,793
 My God!

335
01:19:56,547 --> 01:19:58,549
 the rats devour me!

336
01:20:14,523 --> 01:20:16,150
 They... They devour me alive!

337
01:20:32,749 --> 01:20:34,042
 They devour me alive!

338
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:36,837
 Help me, they devour me alive!

339
01:20:36,837 --> 01:20:37,838
 Help me!

340
01:20:38,422 --> 01:20:39,423
 Help me!

341
01:21:28,347 --> 01:21:29,389
 Come, looks at.

342
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:32,017
 All that!

343
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:37,689
 This bitchy girl of Countess 
 thought of having hidden them well.

344
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:40,901
 That took 15 minutes well to me 
 to find them.

345
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:43,862
 - You have bu.
 - Not a drop!

346
01:21:44,363 --> 01:21:47,157
 - I it sens.
 - I said to you that not.

347
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:55,958
 Very well.

348
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,128
 Goes up quickly and calls her husband.

349
01:22:00,587 --> 01:22:01,797
 Nobody it trouvera
à this hour.

350
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,967
 Dis that Comtesse
est precipitately left

351
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:08,428
 and carried all its jewels 
 with it.

352
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:13,392
 - And if this bitchy girl returns? 
 - No risk, it will return.

353
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:17,437
 How can you be so sure for it? 
 It could return?

354
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:19,857
 I ensure you that it will not return.

355
01:22:21,191 --> 01:22:23,318
 Calls simply her husband.

356
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:27,948
 is in our turn to benefit from it.

357
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:30,868
 We will live 
 as the Countess Elects...

358
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:33,662
 and all these rich person bastards.

359
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:11,992
 Which is there?

360
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,019
 Which is there?

361
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:08,882
 John?

362
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:13,387
 John?

363
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,527
 This sentence!

364
01:27:18,822 --> 01:27:21,450
 "Under the sole of your shoes".

365
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:01,323
 "the key is under the sole 
 of your shoes".

366
01:36:27,496 --> 01:36:29,289
 I see that you found the passage.

367
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,629
 I imagine that you know who I am?

368
01:36:36,463 --> 01:36:37,422
 Not, I do not know.

369
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:39,466
 It is a long time, 
 when I lived in London,

370
01:36:39,842 --> 01:36:41,343
 I were made call Varelli.

371
01:36:41,677 --> 01:36:45,222
 Today, I use another name, 
 so that me am forgotten.

372
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:48,016
 does My voice surprise you?

373
01:36:48,642 --> 01:36:50,227
 I can speak only with this.

374
01:36:51,812 --> 01:36:54,189
 I built the houses of the Three Mothers.

375
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:57,067
 Of the houses which became 
 their eyes and their ears.

376
01:36:57,568 --> 01:37:02,489
 And then I buried myself here 
 and this building became my body.

377
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:06,118
 Its bricks are my âme.
 Its corridors, my veins.

378
01:37:07,578 --> 01:37:09,830
 And its horror, my c?ur.

379
01:37:10,747 --> 01:37:14,001
 My s?ur... Where is my s?ur?

380
01:37:14,126 --> 01:37:16,795
 Venez ici.
 They should not hear you.

381
01:37:17,796 --> 01:37:22,509
 It is cruelest of all... 
 the Mother of the Shades.

382
01:37:24,386 --> 01:37:25,596
 Approach.

383
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:31,560
 would you Be afraid of a man 
 who can hardly move?

384
01:37:32,519 --> 01:37:34,813
 nearer, than I can murmur.

385
01:38:49,638 --> 01:38:54,643
 I am dying, 
 but that will not change anything.

386
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:59,022
 They do not want that that changes.

387
01:39:00,816 --> 01:39:06,280
 I am not the Master, 
 I am a right... slave.

388
01:39:06,321 --> 01:39:08,782
 Which is this? 
 Who lives in this cursed residence?

389
01:39:09,533 --> 01:39:13,370
 - Somebody who waits... 
 - Which?

390
01:39:13,662 --> 01:39:15,956
 One observed you.

391
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:24,590
 For them... 
 we are only dust.

392
01:40:29,613 --> 01:40:30,823
 That burns.

393
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:37,913
 All will burn, like front.

394
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:40,165
 We must leave from here.

395
01:41:05,149 --> 01:41:10,028
 You cannot partir.
 Your voyage is completed.

396
01:41:10,237 --> 01:41:12,197
 all around you will become darkness.

397
01:41:12,322 --> 01:41:14,366
 And somebody will take the hand to you.

398
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:16,910
 You will be filled, and not sad.

399
01:41:17,327 --> 01:41:20,247
 You will know moments 
 of an incredible clearness.

400
01:41:30,883 --> 01:41:32,509
 You think that it is magic.

401
01:41:33,469 --> 01:41:36,638
 Not! I am not magician.

402
01:41:37,681 --> 01:41:42,019
 time presses, it remains to us 
 much to make so that you exchanges.

403
01:41:42,811 --> 01:41:45,522
 You sought me, 
 just like your s?ur.

404
01:41:45,939 --> 01:41:49,109
 It is what you wanted, 
 then I come to take to you!

405
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:50,402
 Say to me who you are!

406
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:54,281
 Three Mères.
 didn't you include/understand?

407
01:41:55,699 --> 01:41:57,451
 MATER Tenebrarum,

408
01:41:57,701 --> 01:42:01,622
 MATER Lacrimarum, MATER Suspiriorum.

409
01:42:02,372 --> 01:42:05,959
 But the men 
 gave us a single name.

410
01:42:06,168 --> 01:42:08,545
 a name which terrorizes them all...

411
01:42:09,046 --> 01:42:10,047
 They us call...

412
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:11,507
 Death!

413
01:42:12,299 --> 01:42:13,300
 Death!

414
01:42:14,968 --> 01:42:31,652
