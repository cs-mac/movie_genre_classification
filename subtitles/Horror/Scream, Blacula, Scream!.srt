1
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,411
You're telling me that she
didn't name a successor?

2
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,319
Then it's mine.

3
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,753
I'm her son.

4
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,388
The loa goes to me.

5
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,037
I'm sorry, Willis, but that's not so.

6
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,707
She had to name someone,
and she didn't,

7
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,411
- so now it goes to a vote.
- Bullshit!

8
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,581
The leadership goes to me!

9
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,083
Can't this kind of talk
wait for another day?

10
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,852
It belongs to me, you hear?

11
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:03,323
It's mine! I'm the new papa-loa!

12
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,460
- We told you that couldn't be.
- Not unless we vote you in.

13
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,726
Well, let me tell you
something, bitch.

14
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,599
I am the rightful heir,

15
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:17,560
and there ain't no way... no way
that you gonna keep it from me!

16
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,005
You in trouble, Lisa.

17
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,777
You're all in trouble,
and you gonna know it!

18
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,737
Don't nobody turn
they back on Big Willis!

19
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:32,452
Especially you. If my mama
hadn't taken you off the street,

20
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,912
you'd still be peddling,
you jive-ass bitch!

21
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:46,132
One time. If I ever catch
you even thinking about Lisa

22
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,301
or anybody else here in this room,

23
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,169
your ass is mine.

24
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,605
Dig it?

25
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:03,613
Right, brother.

26
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,845
Right.

27
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,292
You good people take care, you hear?

28
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,736
Be seeing you.

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,968
And when we vote,
we're voting for Lisa.

30
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,087
They were afraid...

31
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,460
I, as voodoo priest,
had too much power!

32
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,730
I too sought revenge.

33
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,468
I swore one day...

34
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:42,382
they would pay for
having me dethroned!

35
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,476
What is it?

36
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,452
Bones.

37
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:52,813
Bones that's powerful enough
to revenge all past indignities!

38
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,820
You must be careful...

39
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,425
for this is power...

40
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,666
beyond all common man!

41
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,831
I ain't afraid of no power!

42
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,443
Good.

43
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,213
This is all you need to know.

44
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,454
Take it!

45
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,056
Hey, Blood.

46
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,490
Hey, what's this, man?

47
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,423
What's going on, man?

48
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,467
I can't see myself!

49
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,366
You got something to
do with this, man?

50
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:17,183
I'm afraid that's one of the
misfortunes of the cursed.

51
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,643
Oh, man, you jivin'!

52
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,757
Hey, look here, man,

53
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,558
you mean to tell me I ain't never
gonna see my face again?

54
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,264
Look, man, I don't mind being
a vampire and all that shit,

55
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,099
but this really ain't hip.

56
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,695
I mean, a man has
got to see his face!

57
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,396
Shit!

58
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,233
I don't even know if
I want to go now.

59
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,845
Can't even see myself!

60
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,485
How do I look, man?

61
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,656
You were going somewhere?

62
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,862
Yeah. Justin's having a big party.

63
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,207
- He's showing off his African collection.
- African?

64
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,910
Yeah. Dude's brought
back all kind of stuff...

65
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,539
sculpting, jewelry.

66
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:36,551
Come on, man, tell me the truth.
It's important. How do I look?

67
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,198
You've decided to go?

68
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,433
Well, you know, I might as well.

69
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,435
Anyway, my old lady's gonna be there,

70
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,272
and she gonna get dead
in my case if I ain't there,

71
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,975
so, look, you have a nice evening,
and I'll see you later.

72
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,137
You'll go nowhere!

73
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,647
Now listen to me carefully.

74
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,353
You are never to leave this
house without my permission.

75
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:14,733
Your only justification for crawling
on this earth is to serve me.

76
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,362
Understand me well.

77
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,596
If you ever dare to disobey...

78
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,409
I will slice into your chest

79
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:27,836
and pull your worthless life out.

80
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,309
Right.

81
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:14,181
You shall pay, Black Prince.

82
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,230
I shall place a curse
of suffering on you

83
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,134
that will doom you to a living hell.

84
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,001
A hunger...

85
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:30,109
a wild, gnawing,
animal hunger will grow in you,

86
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,712
a hunger for human blood.

87
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:38,751
I curse you with my name!

88
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,380
You shall be...

89
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,912
Blacula...

90
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,583
a vampire, like myself.

91
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,062
The place looks deserted.

92
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,190
The owner's on vacation.

93
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,028
Leave it to Willis to
get himself a soft job.

94
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,945
Hey, Willis!

95
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,620
Willis, it's us, Elaine and Louis.

96
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,293
Hey, Willis!

97
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,623
Hey, man, we're gonna
be late for the party!

98
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,150
Maybe he's already gone.

99
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,323
No, he knew we were
coming to pick him up.

100
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,497
This place gives me the creeps.

101
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,488
Look around down here.
I'm going upstairs.

102
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,446
Alone?

103
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,663
Hello?

104
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,151
Hey, Willis.

105
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,180
Hey, man, you there?

106
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,456
Hey, Denny!

107
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,625
I've been looking all over for you.

108
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,294
What's with that long face?

109
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,229
Willis should have
been here an hour ago.

110
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,733
Judging from what I heard happened
between him and Justin this morning,

111
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,397
ain't nobody named Willis
showing up at this party.

112
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,096
This is it.

113
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,408
It's beautiful.

114
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,976
Exquisite.

115
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,579
The Niger Dynasty produced
so many fine artifacts.

116
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,446
Eboni.

117
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,919
I beg your pardon, sir?

118
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,617
The necklace is of the Eboni Dynasty.

119
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,927
We appreciate your concern, sir,
but I believe you're mistaken.

120
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:46,298
Hardly. It was fashioned in 1755.

121
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,725
This necklace was worn
by Princess Luva.

122
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,938
Do you have the matching necklace?

123
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,706
No. I didn't know there was one.

124
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,276
Oh, yes. The other was
made for her husband,

125
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:00,939
a prince of the Eboni tribe.

126
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,350
A thousand pardons.

127
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,819
I didn't mean to intrude,
but I was out walking,

128
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,057
- and the happy sounds attracted me.
- Not at all. I think it's terrific.

129
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,992
Are you sure about
those dates and things?

130
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,060
Yes.

131
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,228
That's great.
I'm happy to have you here.

132
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,097
I'm Justin Carter.

133
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,167
Jambo. I'm called Mamuwalde.

134
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,635
Mamuwalde.

135
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,572
- Miss Lisa Fortier.
- Mademoiselle Fortier.

136
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:32,533
Professor Walston,
African Studies, Robson University.

137
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,538
It's my pleasure.

138
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,250
What part of Africa are you from?

139
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,551
The Segu River region,
just north of the Niger Delta.

140
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,592
I really must compliment you on
your collection. It's just splendid.

141
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,327
Thanks. It's a good one.

142
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,564
Justin has donated the collection
to the university museum.

143
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,666
I'm very happy.

144
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,402
Well, the party's sort
of an official good-bye.

145
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,603
I see.

146
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:02,540
Tell me, have you any more pieces
from the Segu River region?

147
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,609
Yeah, there are, as a matter of fact.

148
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,778
Would you like to take
a look at some of them?

149
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,407
I'd be most pleased to. Thank you.

150
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,384
Why don't you show Mamuwalde around?

151
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,619
With such a lovely guide,

152
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:18,181
I'm afraid I'd lose my
concentration on the artwork.

153
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,848
How about that?

154
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,236
I do believe he knows
what he's talking about.

155
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,603
Interesting dude.

156
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,204
An historian...

157
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,220
or a dealer in African antiquities?

158
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,321
Neither.

159
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,389
Merely a devoted amateur.

160
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,326
All things African interest me.

161
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:05,286
- What do you do?
- Actually, I'm retired.

162
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,796
Pretty young to be retired.

163
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:12,399
Very kind, but I'm afraid I'm
considerably older than I appear.

164
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,600
Why do you stare?

165
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,636
I feel we've met before.

166
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,941
No. If we had, I would
not have forgotten.

167
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,456
Justin's asking for you.
I think he needs some help.

168
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,024
- Thanks, Denny.
- Sure.

169
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,653
- Excuse me.
- But of course.

170
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,606
- How you doin'?
- I'm doing fine.

171
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,483
It's kind of
strange-looking, isn't it?

172
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,151
It is rather unusual.

173
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,321
- Perhaps you can help me.
- Sure. What is it?

174
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,890
What exactly is this doll?

175
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,059
It looks familiar,
but I can't quite...

176
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,727
You know it's a voodoo doll.

177
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:10,929
Yes.

178
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,766
Well, I think this one has
to do with evil spirits.

179
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,267
I'm not sure, though.

180
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,635
You should ask Lisa. She might know.

181
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,774
Might know? You've got to be kidding.

182
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,442
When it comes to voodoo,

183
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:28,446
Lisa has more natural power than
anyone in the last 10 years.

184
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,574
Really?

185
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,786
So the mama-loa
virtually adopted you.

186
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:38,416
At 17, you don't get adopted.

187
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,458
Anyway, I'd hate to think
of where I might be

188
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,126
if she hadn't taken
an interest in me.

189
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,795
Now you're being much too modest.

190
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,298
I've been informed that you
have exceptional powers

191
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,636
in the exceedingly complex
science of voodoo.

192
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:55,596
Science? I never thought
of it that way.

193
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,644
To us, voodoo is simply a religion

194
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:02,011
based on faith.

195
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,983
A powerful, powerful faith.

196
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,319
Is it true, then,
that under proper circumstances

197
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,422
you can control the inner being

198
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,722
and change its destiny?

199
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,860
You're staring again.

200
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,971
I'm sorry.

201
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,831
Is something wrong?

202
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,568
I don't know.

203
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,883
- Oh, my goodness.
- It's my fault.

204
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,786
- It's my stupid fault.
- Let's put something on that.

205
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:42,987
How bad is it?

206
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,684
- Bad enough!
- It'll be all right.

207
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,626
Maggie, there's a first aid
kit in the upstairs bathroom.

208
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,823
I'll join you in a minute.

209
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:54,966
- Would you excuse me.
- I must be leaving myself.

210
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,968
Must you? It'll only take a minute.

211
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,972
Yes, I must go. I thank you
very much for a lovely evening.

212
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:04,309
- Will we be seeing you again?
- Oh, yes, indeed you will.

213
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,200
And a good night to you.

214
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:22,959
Mr. Carter.

215
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,263
Mamuwalde. Justin, please.

216
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:28,599
Thank you. I'm afraid the wine
has made me somewhat weary.

217
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,502
- I do hope you've enjoyed yourself.
- Very much, thank you.

218
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:35,940
Mamuwalde, I've acquired some
ancient African jewelry,

219
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,276
and I was wondering if you
could come by sometime

220
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,445
and help me figure
where it came from.

221
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,114
- I'd be delighted.
- How about tomorrow afternoon?

222
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:48,413
Evening would prove better for me.
I'm rather a night person.

223
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,289
I have an awful habit of sleeping
away the daylight hours.

224
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,793
Well, it's done.
Thank you for coming.

225
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,660
Good night.

226
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,972
- How's Gloria?
- She's fine. It's just a small cut.

227
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,362
Maggie's with her.

228
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,382
You just follow me, Carol.

229
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,271
You really don't waste
no time, do you?

230
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,774
Well, a man's got to let you
know where he's coming from.

231
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,276
But dig: We'll go to my place,

232
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:48,804
smoke a little taste, and get down.

233
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,692
I'll just love you a while.

234
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,887
- You sure you're all right?
- Sure, I'm fine.

235
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,756
How's the hand?

236
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,258
Beautiful. Don't worry about it.

237
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,094
Well, okay.

238
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,262
If you're sure you're all right,
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

239
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,153
- Okay.
- All right. Good night.

240
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,606
Brother, I still think
you miss the Force.

241
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,441
Professor, let me
tell you something...

242
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,943
my publishing firm in
one month makes more

243
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:09,547
than the entire police
department makes in one year.

244
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,312
Do you still think I dig the Force?

245
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,854
Gloria!

246
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,828
- Step back.
- God! What happened?

247
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,026
Give her some air, will ya?

248
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,236
Shit.

249
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,177
Good evening.

250
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,446
Want some company?

251
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,248
I beg your pardon?

252
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:27,742
I said, Do you want some company?

253
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,151
Forget it.

254
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,475
Say, what is it we got here?

255
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,310
Don't you dig our merchandise?

256
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,212
What's the matter, man,
don't you dig girls,

257
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,981
or is that the reason for the cape?

258
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,049
Sure is a sweet-looking thing.

259
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,152
Hey, man, with threads like that,

260
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,654
it figures you've got
to be loaded, right?

261
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,323
So, why don't you pass
some this way, brother?

262
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,190
Hey, faggot!

263
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,888
We're talking to you.

264
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,366
What is it you want?

265
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,102
"What is it you want?" Shit!

266
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,904
Your bread, man! All of it!

267
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,940
Or we're gonna have
to become antisocial

268
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,968
and kick your ass, you dig?

269
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,618
I'm sorry, I don't have
any "bread" with me.

270
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,788
And as for "kicking my ass,"

271
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:42,026
I strongly recommend that you give it
careful consideration before trying.

272
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,194
You jive mutha!

273
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,397
Either you give it up, or we're gonna
take it out on your black ass!

274
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,132
You've made a slave of your sister.

275
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,101
You're still slaves,
imitating your slave masters!

276
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:54,265
Hey, sucka!

277
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,687
I've always considered
myself a reasonable man.

278
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,957
My thinking may be prejudiced
due to race, creed, and color,

279
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,293
but, then again,
none of us are perfect.

280
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,963
I'm gonna give you the benefit of
my friendship with Justin here.

281
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,132
Harlan, what the hell
are you talking about?

282
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,035
How can you even consider
Lisa as a possible suspect?

283
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,804
'Cause this girl's murder
tonight is not a normal murder.

284
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,774
If you ask me, the voodoo freaks
had something to do with it.

285
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,972
Harley, man, we are tired.

286
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:12,283
Lisa, I know you people
never talk of your voodoo,

287
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,419
so I won't bother asking
questions pertaining to it,

288
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,189
but there are certain characteristics

289
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:23,093
generic to your religion that
even the layperson knows.

290
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:27,485
Allow me to mention two
of the most obvious.

291
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:28,966
Now, one is snakes.

292
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,201
Even the uninitiated knows

293
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,771
that snakes to voodooists
are like cows to Hindus.

294
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,572
Two... and this one's disgusting...

295
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,272
Two, you guys drink blood.

296
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,013
Now, this girl's body

297
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:47,451
had two snake-like puncture
marks on its throat,

298
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:51,221
and said body was completely
drained of blood.

299
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,290
Completely drained of blood!

300
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,693
If that doesn't add up to voodoo,
I don't know what does.

301
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,960
Justin, do I have to sit here
and listen to this crap?

302
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,503
Hey, just take it easy now.

303
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,098
Pull yourself together now.

304
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:15,579
Now, Harley, I admit those were
strange-looking marks, man,

305
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,082
and I know you're down on her thing,

306
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:21,143
but you don't have to
get sloppy about it.

307
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,758
What's this between you and Willis?

308
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,594
I hear he's out to get you.

309
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,997
I have nothing against Willis.

310
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,599
Man, why don't you bring
him in here and ask him?

311
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:36,867
I will.

312
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,669
If you need any help, give me a call.

313
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,196
You think I'm gonna need it?

314
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,008
The worst detective I ever had,
and he wants to help.

315
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:48,366
I'm amazed I didn't throw him off
the Force long before he quit.

316
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,910
Yo.

317
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,658
For you.

318
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:10,901
Damn! Can you believe it?
Same thing...

319
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:14,929
no blood, and the same
stupid-looking marks.

320
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,264
Hey, Justin...

321
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,041
I need your help.

322
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,254
Okay, come on, people, move it out.

323
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,382
Let's go, let's go.

324
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,456
Keep moving.

325
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,412
How'd you find me?

326
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,610
Ex-detective, remember?

327
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,610
What's wrong?

328
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,755
Those killings last night...

329
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,886
the cause of death was
identical to Gloria's.

330
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,394
What's going on?

331
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,765
Lisa, I've got to find out as
much as I can about the cult.

332
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,267
Now the Lieutenant is looking
to bring you in as a suspect.

333
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,535
I want to prevent that.

334
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,205
The Lieutenant is crazy.
He's out to get me.

335
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:56,273
Thank you.

336
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,443
Look, honey, I told him
that I would talk with you.

337
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,278
I've got to find out as much as I can

338
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,047
about your membership in the cult.

339
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,184
Are there any vendettas,
grudges, anything like that?

340
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:11,054
As far as I know,
no one had it in for Gloria,

341
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,390
or for anyone, for that matter.

342
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,893
The only grudge, if you
want to call it that,

343
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,728
is the one Willis might have for me.

344
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,897
But I don't see how killing
Gloria and those two guys

345
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,799
would give him any satisfaction.

346
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:25,395
Unless he wants to break up the cult.

347
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:33,039
You know something?

348
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:38,312
If anything ever happened to you,
I'd just blow the whole thing.

349
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,879
What's happening tonight?

350
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,977
I've been asked to sit
with Gloria's body.

351
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,287
Willis, if your black ass is here,

352
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,917
you'd better not let me see
it 'cause I'll bust it in two!

353
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,321
Hey, Mama.

354
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,864
"Mama"? I'll "mama" you,
you son of a bitch.

355
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,799
Why are you scaring me like this?

356
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,375
- Keeping me waitin'.
- Come on girl.

357
00:50:37,476 --> 00:50:39,302
- You did it on purpose.
- Slow down.

358
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,638
Where have you been
the past few days?

359
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:45,598
- Why are you hiding from me?
- Willis ain't hidin', baby.

360
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,442
He's been workin' overtime.

361
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,682
Hey, come on, baby.

362
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,947
Just relax.

363
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:04,782
Come on, let me get a
good feel of those bones.

364
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,296
I missed you.

365
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:15,468
These bones are tense, baby.

366
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:16,673
Oh, yeah?

367
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:17,774
Come on.

368
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:22,075
Willis is gonna do something to
work all that out for you, okay?

369
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:36,650
What you doin'?

370
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,144
Hey, baby, these bones are tight.

371
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:57,274
Well, what you gonna do about that?

372
00:51:57,814 --> 00:51:59,816
Big Willis is gonna
have to do something

373
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,843
to relax your entire body.

374
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:08,846
You think you know just how
to get to me, don't you?

375
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:15,396
I can feel the blood just
humming through this fine body.

376
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,466
That feels good.

377
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,633
I missed you, Willis.

378
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,977
Hey, take it easy.

379
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,318
Willis, you're hurting me.

380
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,794
Where did you get them teeth?

381
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,992
Take that crap out yo' mouth!

382
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,333
Willis, stop it now.

383
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,102
Stop it now, Willis.

384
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:55,664
Stop it, I mean it! Stop it!

385
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:04,419
Come here.

386
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,292
Don't be afraid.

387
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,922
That's it.

388
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,399
Come on.

389
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,510
Hello, Lisa.

390
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,820
I won't hurt you.

391
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,847
You're my friend.

392
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:39,122
Come here.

393
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,804
Don't be frightened.

394
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,373
Closer.

395
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,314
Closer.

396
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:03,612
Come on.

397
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,383
Come on.

398
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,986
- No!
- Lisa.

399
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,485
You're safe.

400
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,223
Don't fear me.

401
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,392
Stay away.

402
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,232
Who are you?

403
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:35,271
Gloria... what happened to Gloria?

404
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,339
You would never understand.

405
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:43,583
I'm moved by powers no human
is capable of comprehending.

406
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,822
The things I do, the acts I commit,

407
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,158
are beyond my control.

408
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:51,185
But where did you come from?

409
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,628
The fire that gave me life.

410
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:03,705
Fire!

411
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:10,477
Then you... I knew I'd seen you!

412
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:17,317
The other night,
rising through flames!

413
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:23,718
Through voodoo,
you possess a great power.

414
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,862
Great power!

415
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,630
I must ask your help.

416
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,157
I need your help!

417
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,339
I must see you again.

418
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,147
But Gloria...
what happened to Gloria?

419
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,982
Please! You must let
me see you again!

420
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,611
I'll make everything
clear to you then.

421
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,013
Yes.

422
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:09,201
I have gathered you all
here to issue a warning.

423
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,707
You all know Lisa Fortier.

424
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:22,206
She is under my protection.

425
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,812
Not one of you shall harm her.

426
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,650
This is a commandment!

427
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,923
And if one of you disobeys...

428
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:39,364
you will never imagine
the pain I offer.

429
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:45,002
Unendurable, everlasting agony.

430
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:54,349
Now leave me.

431
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,685
You are foul.

432
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:02,683
Your faces sicken even me.

433
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,796
Good night.

434
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:19,135
I gotta tell you, babe...

435
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,844
you sure know how to live.

436
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:24,180
Hey, you know, the way I look at it,

437
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,413
if that jive mutha leaves
Big Willis alone...

438
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,787
Willis gonna leave him alone, baby.

439
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:35,959
Now you talkin', honey.
You just ignore his ass.

440
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,862
- But you know one thing, though?
- What's that?

441
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:43,094
That skinny-ass Lisa...

442
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:46,803
that bitch is gonna
fall under my wrath!

443
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:48,972
Not directly, mind you...

444
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:52,241
but surreptitiously, you dig?

445
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:55,378
Yeah, I believe it. And you
wanna know something else?

446
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:56,613
What's that, baby?

447
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,716
She deserves whatever you give her.

448
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:03,608
And she's gonna get it all!

449
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,824
I never did like that bitch.

450
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:11,661
OI' bad-ass Blacula comes
telling us to lay off of her.

451
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:15,331
But no matter what,
I'm gonna get back at that bitch!

452
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,501
She did too big a number on me
to let her get off that easy.

453
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:22,005
Well, what you gonna
do to her, sugar?

454
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:23,872
I'm waitin'.

455
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:26,776
I'm waitin' on the inspiration...

456
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:30,907
but it's got to be
something... special.

457
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,785
You dare...?

458
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,585
Oh, shit, what'd I do?

459
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,093
What's happening, man?

460
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,221
You were warned.

461
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,928
Warned about what?

462
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:54,258
That nothing should
ever happen to Lisa.

463
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:57,640
Who's gonna harm Lisa?

464
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,809
I love that bitch!

465
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,075
What right you got,
coming in here botherin' us?

466
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,314
Hey, baby, cool it.

467
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,816
I heard about you.

468
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:09,085
You just stay on your
side of the house.

469
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,153
Hey, Denny!

470
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:14,022
Well, you just gonna let
him bully you around?

471
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:18,424
Hey, man.

472
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,667
Don't mind her.

473
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:27,159
She means well.

474
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:32,139
What are you lookin' at?

475
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,443
Hey, Denny.

476
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:37,280
Now, look, I'm not taking any
more of this shit, Willis.

477
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,283
I mean, whose house
is this, yours or his?

478
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,980
Listen, you, if you...

479
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,811
Now, you be thankful that I've chosen

480
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,179
not to rip out your worthless heart.

481
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,323
Very shortly...

482
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:23,350
I shall bring Lisa Fortier here.

483
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,995
I shall designate a quiet room

484
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:29,799
which you are to arrange
according to her instructions.

485
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,268
Once we enter that room,

486
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,271
there are to be no interruptions.

487
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:39,504
If you allow any violation
of that commandment...

488
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,303
Right.

489
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,362
What is it?

490
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:02,992
Damnedest thing I've
ever seen. Bat pelage.

491
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,801
What the hell is bat pelage?

492
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,430
Hairs from the skin of a bat.

493
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,974
Bat? What kind of a bat?

494
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,142
I don't know.

495
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:16,272
Actually, we've never
seen one like this before.

496
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,611
It could be a new species.

497
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,993
Let's see.

498
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,829
This is it, this whole shelf.

499
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:37,631
Black arts, occult.
That should keep you busy a while.

500
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,335
Vampires!

501
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:14,270
Are you out of your mind?

502
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,540
Probably, but I'd still
like to look into it.

503
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,042
You think you can prove
there's a vampire?

504
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,239
I see. Just a minute.

505
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,817
- Hey, Charlie!
- Yeah?

506
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,486
You know who killed that
girl and those two punks?

507
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:33,854
- No, who?
- A vampire!

508
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,289
Charlie's our expert on everything.

509
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:46,292
Harley, are you through
having your fun?

510
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:50,339
I didn't say I can prove it,
but let's give the theory a shot.

511
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:54,343
Bat hairs, bodies drained of blood,
one even disappeared.

512
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,143
Now, you can't ignore
the possibility.

513
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,615
Look, have you talked to Willis yet?

514
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,017
Lieutenant? Excuse me.

515
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,685
Hi, Justin.

516
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,687
- There's something strange here.
- What?

517
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,689
These are the pictures we
took of the dead bodies,

518
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,715
and there's no sign of them.

519
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,985
It's as if they were never there.

520
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,651
What the hell does this mean?

521
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,865
Here, let me see that.

522
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,034
Maybe the film is faulty.

523
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:21,334
Impossible. Everything else
came out in those pictures.

524
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:23,404
Okay, Milt.

525
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:25,875
Hey, Harley, this backs me up!

526
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:29,312
Everybody knows that vampires
can't be photographed.

527
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:32,271
Every 10-year-old knows that!

528
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:35,273
Boy, you're making me nervous.

529
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,113
Sergeant Williams!

530
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:40,945
You want me to do something?

531
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,827
Harley, I want you to
get permission for me

532
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:47,663
to look at one of those bodies,
and I want you to come with me.

533
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:49,530
No.

534
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,168
Yes, Lieutenant?

535
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:53,836
Get someone over to
the Anderson place

536
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,738
and bring Willis Daniels in.

537
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,627
Right, sir.

538
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,301
You really mean it, don't you?

539
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,209
Will you do it?

540
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:08,546
I'm really getting to dislike you.

541
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,557
Would you care for some wine?

542
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,822
Not a thing, thank you.

543
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:23,163
I see you're interested in folklore.

544
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,368
Yeah, I've been on
sort of a kick lately.

545
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:28,862
Been reading all sorts
of junk like this.

546
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,808
Junk?

547
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,811
Well, you've got to admit
this stuff is pretty far out.

548
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:40,149
You believe in any of it?
Occult rituals?

549
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,650
Let me say that, um,

550
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,652
I believe there are
many things that exist

551
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:46,322
that man does not know about.

552
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,557
Man needs ritual,

553
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,493
some form of worship

554
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:55,762
to combat the very real
existence of death.

555
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:02,171
I look upon that as one
of man's basic needs.

556
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,240
Well, I go along with that.

557
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,802
But I've got to tell you,
I'm a born cynic.

558
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:10,679
I finished this one book,
and it had...

559
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:13,945
You ever hear of Count Dracula?

560
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,752
Yes, of course.

561
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:19,244
A vampire, right?

562
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,926
Well, this book tried to

563
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:27,797
make me believe that
he really existed.

564
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,465
And not only that,

565
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:33,232
it tried to convince me
that vampires are real.

566
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,667
That's fascinating.

567
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,807
I guess we'd both best be careful

568
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:41,107
that one doesn't jump out
at us some dark night.

569
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,312
It says to kill one,

570
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:46,315
a wooden stake must be
driven through its heart.

571
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,876
I wonder if that's true.

572
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,179
I wonder.

573
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:59,820
I've always loved the deep
red color of a fine wine.

574
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,022
It is beautiful, isn't it?

575
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:08,625
Yes, much like the deep
red color of blood.

576
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,693
Yes.

577
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:15,205
I think I will have a
little glass after all.

578
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,219
You know...

579
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,017
you never told me where
you were staying.

580
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,761
You know, you've never asked.

581
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,997
Where are you staying?

582
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,768
Do you really care to know?

583
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:44,340
Why not?

584
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,477
Justin, rather than give you
information of no consequence,

585
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:53,677
allow me to offer you some
rather profound advice.

586
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,485
Forget your theories.

587
01:10:56,585 --> 01:11:00,156
Return these books to their shelves,
because if there's one thing

588
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,491
you should have discovered
in your studies,

589
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:07,196
it is that the intelligence of
man is pathetically inadequate

590
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:10,199
when pitted against the
forces of the unknown.

591
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:14,125
A man comes face to
face with a vampire...

592
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:18,228
he would most surely be at its mercy.

593
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,815
I believe a vampire...

594
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:34,652
is responsible for the recent
killings in this town.

595
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:39,295
Then you believe in vampires.

596
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:41,162
Good.

597
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:46,098
That gives you something
of an edge over the rest.

598
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:49,431
I'm going to find him...

599
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:53,105
and I'm going to do
whatever's necessary...

600
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:55,676
to kill him.

601
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:01,444
Justin, I hope you have good luck...

602
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,653
and find nothing,

603
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,822
because if you're right,

604
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:11,624
and these unfortunate deaths are
indeed the work of a vampire...

605
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:17,524
who knows who will be
its next helpless victim?

606
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,435
Now I must go.

607
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:45,416
Do have a good night.

608
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:01,000
I'm frightened.

609
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:06,605
For the first time in
my life, I'm frightened.

610
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,486
All my life, I've feared nothing,

611
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,888
and now you tell me what you are,

612
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:15,346
and I accept it.

613
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:23,356
Completely, without question.

614
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:27,963
- I'm afraid.
- You mustn't be.

615
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:31,566
No harm can come to you.

616
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:33,974
But...

617
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:35,944
I have no choice.

618
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:39,745
My only alternative
is to destroy myself.

619
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,619
Lisa, I know that voodoo,
in the proper hands,

620
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:45,954
can unlock many mysteries.

621
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:49,291
Yours is a power unlike mine.

622
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:51,960
It can be used for
good as well as evil.

623
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:55,130
Now, if I were back
home with my people,

624
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:58,260
they would understand
me and forgive me.

625
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:01,804
Therefore I ask that you help
me return to my homeland

626
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:08,267
by exorcising this demonic
creature that inhabits my body.

627
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,482
Yes.

628
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,610
You must try.

629
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:20,683
There's no other way.
You're my only hope.

630
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,055
I'll try.

631
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:01,530
- Who is it?
- The police.

632
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,092
We'd like to have a
word with Lisa Fortier.

633
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,719
- Lisa Fortier?
- Yes.

634
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:26,321
- May we come in?
- No. What do you want?

635
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:28,056
The Lieutenant wants
to talk to you, ma'am.

636
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:30,184
We have a warrant.

637
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,666
I advise you to let the lady go.

638
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:46,400
Who are you?

639
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:50,874
You'd better stay
out of this, mister.

640
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,686
I implore you for the last time,

641
01:15:57,786 --> 01:15:59,922
leave her alone and leave this house.

642
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:03,225
Listen, buddy, we got a warrant.

643
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:04,359
You know what a warrant is?

644
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:08,956
You stay out of this, or I'll lock
your uppity black ass up for...

645
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:17,237
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

646
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,982
I think you're gonna need a
little more than an empty coffin

647
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,485
to convince me of vampires,
wouldn't you say?

648
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,487
Harley, just think of
what's happened...

649
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:36,289
the two punks, Gloria,
both bodies drained of blood.

650
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:39,661
But, Harley, that means something.

651
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,830
What about the photographs?

652
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:44,333
Oh, for Christ's sake, I don't know.

653
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,336
Look, give me the benefit
of the doubt, okay?

654
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:50,839
Now, look, don't get nervous,
but I had my men pick Lisa up.

655
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:52,007
What?

656
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,176
For her own protection, just in case.

657
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:58,045
Hey, one of your clients are missing!

658
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,884
Lieutenant.

659
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,556
Yeah?

660
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,960
What?

661
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,827
When?

662
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,658
The two of them?

663
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,357
You all know what to look for.

664
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:26,028
Whoever finds the girl,
get her out of there right away.

665
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:28,520
Hey, Harley!

666
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,299
Come here!

667
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,808
Why don't you have every
man to get one of these?

668
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,977
- Hey, Justin, don't you think...
- Harley.

669
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:45,107
Please, please, man, trust me.

670
01:19:45,413 --> 01:19:46,648
Well, go ahead. Take 'em.

671
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:48,845
Come on, come on!

672
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,653
Lieutenant, don't you think
this is a little ridiculous?

673
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:54,111
Go on, take one and shut up.

674
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:28,254
I can feel it!

675
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:30,448
Yes!

676
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:33,693
Leave him!

677
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:10,490
Shoot her!

678
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:30,875
Come!

679
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,639
Yes, I can feel it!

680
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:37,452
Yes.

681
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:39,683
Charm!

682
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,152
Charm!

683
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:57,967
Charm!

684
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,747
It was working!

685
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:08,216
I could have been free!

686
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:10,185
It was working! Working!

687
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,220
We'll do it again! We'll start over!

688
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,988
- You'll come with me, then?
- Yes!

689
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:16,491
- Now?
- Yes, only don't hurt him.

690
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:19,222
Please don't hurt him!

691
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,755
No! Stop it!

692
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:19,988
I've got to get you out of here.

693
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:22,150
We must try again.

694
01:29:35,603 --> 01:29:37,472
Please, don't hurt him!

695
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:39,600
No, please!

696
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,432
Stop it!

697
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:40,635
Please, you mustn't be frightened.

698
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:42,661
Stay away.

699
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:46,974
Please. I could never harm you.

700
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,102
Don't touch me!

701
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:52,101
But you've got to help me!

702
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:55,350
No, don't refuse me now!

703
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,852
I need you!

704
01:30:57,952 --> 01:31:00,686
Keep away!

705
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:32,746
Mamuwalde.

706
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:47,660
The name is Blacula!

707
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:50,598
Please, no!

708
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:53,771
Let him alone!

709
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:59,908
The name is Blacula!

710
01:32:00,748 --> 01:32:03,416
Now, Justin,

711
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:07,448
you shall soon know my eternal agony.
