I'm down here!

00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:38,015
Hey!

36
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:40,348
-- The basement.

37
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:45,049
Hello. Hey. Hey.
I'm down here.

38
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:56,428
Just let me go, okay?

39
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,093
Please?

40
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:02,463
'Cause I-- I didn't know
she was married.

41
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:10,260
What are you-- what--
what are you doing?

42
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:13,739
Just look, it's--
it's a fucking misunderstanding.

43
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:15,968
I didn't-- I'm sorry, okay?

44
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:19,671
She was begging for it.
What the fuck did you--?

45
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,738
I didn't read that--
'cause you're her husband.

46
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,148
I-- fuck, I didn't--
okay, just-

47
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,778
how the fuck am I supposed to know
that she was married?

48
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,184
'Cause she wasn't even wearing
a fucking wedding ring, okay?

49
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,314
I swear to God, I'm never-
I'm never gonna touch her again.

50
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,586
I'm gonna get
the fuck out of here, okay?

51
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:39,024
Just...

52
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:46,688
You're-- you're not
her husband.

53
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,700
You're-

54
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:50,667
you're just a sick fuck.

55
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,037
Say something!

56
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:32,103
Hel--
Hello.

57
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:34,735
- Up and at 'em, Deputy.
- Sheriff?

58
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:38,610
Mm, I need you at the station
at 1500 hours.

59
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:41,513
Wait. why?

60
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:43,914
Deputy Jordan's got my shift.

61
00:05:43,938 --> 00:05:45,940
Jordan's MIA.

62
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:49,877
Wait, what?

63
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,911
No one's seen him
since Thursday.

64
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:54,858
Apparently he's gonzo,
out of here,

65
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:57,485
got a whiff of something
he couldn't pass up.

66
00:05:57,515 --> 00:05:58,720
Meow!

67
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:01,627
Sir, I can't work tonight.
It's Christmas Eve.

68
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:03,494
It's Christmas Eve
for all of us,

69
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,226
the season of giving,
so get off your sorry ass.

70
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,495
Town hall's expecting
a record number of Santas.

71
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:11,501
It's gonna be
a real clusterfuck.

72
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:14,527
With all due respect, sir,

73
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,131
today is a really tough day
for me.

74
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:19,471
It's my first Christmas
without John.

75
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:23,137
Okay, well, I'll look forward
to seeing you.

76
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,625
Hmm.

77
00:06:57,658 --> 00:07:00,331
A six-sided item,
nine letters.

78
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,801
Hmm.

79
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,713
I'm home.

80
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,276
I'm innocent, I swear.
I swear.

81
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,807
Police brutality!

82
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,683
Help! Help! Help!

83
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,451
Daddy, I'm sorry I can't be here
tonight, but you understand.

84
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,684
That's okay, darling.
You just write

85
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,022
as many parking tickets as you can
for all those other wannabes

86
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,754
and then look for me
up on that throne.

87
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:33,921
Oh, well, that would be cheating,
wouldn't it, Mother?

88
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,022
- She's straight as an arrow.

89
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:38,998
- I am proud of you, kiddo.
- Thank you.

90
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,626
There's a gift in the mailbox
for you, Hank.

91
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:43,157
Give it here.

92
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,035
Hey, Daddy,
what's a six-sided item?

93
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,594
Uh, a cube.

94
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:49,129
Mm, nine letters.

95
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,798
Uh, a hexagon.

96
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,638
Close. That's seven.

97
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:55,304
I'll figure it out eventually.

98
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,709
Anyways, good luck.

99
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,079
I'm not gonna need it.
This is gonna be my year.

100
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,707
Of course it is.

101
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,082
And in the morning,
we will open up Christmas presents

102
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:08,554
and we will have leftovers and we'll
spend the whole day together, okay?

103
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,646
- You be careful out there, hon.
- Of course.

104
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:13,054
- You promise?
- Of course, Mother.

105
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:16,650
And watch out for those drunken Santas
with the wandering hands, eh?

106
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,389
And no letting them off
with just a smile

107
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,759
and a slap on the wrist,
not my girl.

00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:13,539
but I want you to remember

159
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:16,873
Jesus loves you, Aubrey.

160
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:21,241
He's always here for you.

161
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,536
And so am I.

162
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:30,146
If there's anything

163
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:34,951
I can do to ease your pain,

164
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:38,288
anything at all...

165
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,399
I'm going to be late.

166
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:16,648
You want me
to pour you a coffee?

167
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:19,552
No, it's okay.
I got it.

168
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:22,078
- What are you reading?
- A survey.

169
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,853
It says that Christmas
makes people crazy.

170
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,449
They think
it's the short days.

171
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:29,656
Or maybe it's "Jingle Bells"
100 times before breakfast.

172
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:36,265
- Where is everyone anyway?
- Sheriff's out,

173
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:39,166
scouting the parade route
for suspicious packages.

174
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,692
And where is Giles?

175
00:14:40,725 --> 00:14:42,499
Late, as always.

176
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:45,699
So you hear about Jordan disappearing?
He flew the coop.

177
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:47,469
Yes, that is why
I'm here today.

178
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:49,272
I mean, he couldn't have waited
until after Christmas?

179
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,971
Rumor is there's a girl.

180
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:54,377
They're eloping to Milwaukee.

181
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:56,211
Okay.

182
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:58,239
Of course they are.

183
00:15:04,377 --> 00:15:08,652
Can you think of a nine-letter word
for a six-sided item?

184
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:10,282
For my crossword?

185
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:11,689
Ooh, I'll Google it.

186
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:14,660
What? No. The whole point is
to figure it out yourself.

187
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:17,559
So why are you asking me?

188
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,523
It is just so nice of you
to show up, Giles.

189
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,332
Don't tell me-- I missed a bank heist
and an alien invasion.

190
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:31,998
If I can manage to put on my makeup,
blow-dry my hair and get here on time...

191
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:35,735
The truth is,
I had to stop at the store

192
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:38,471
and get something
for you ladies.

193
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,409
Christmas presents
from you? Really?

194
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:42,845
Don't rush me.
Form a line.

195
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:45,348
Oh, after you've been kissing
the sheriff's asshole, you're gonna-

196
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:46,975
Oh, God.

197
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:48,178
No, thank you.

198
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,349
Sheriff's Department.
Yes.

199
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:56,324
Ma'am, which Santa Claus?
Ma'am?

200
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:59,087
I see.
We'll send someone right over.

201
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:02,627
You know that traveling Santa,
the one in the square?

202
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:05,324
- Yeah. What's up?
- Well, seems he's been making kids cry.

203
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:08,061
- What? How?
- Maybe he got a boner.

204
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:09,123
Ugh.

205
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:11,998
Kids are squirming
in his lap all day.

206
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:13,865
It's bound to happen
sooner or later.

207
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,428
Has anyone ever done
a background check on you, seriously?

208
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:19,168
I'll just take this one
on my own.

209
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,764
What did I say?

210
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:39,651
- Hey.
- Hello.

211
00:16:43,614 --> 00:16:45,149
- Hi there.
- How are you?

212
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:46,854
Fine, thank you.

213
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:51,831
- Ho, ho, ho, Aubrey, Merry Christmas.
- Hi, Merry Christmas.

214
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:55,592
Hi.

215
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:02,738
Looks great. Good job.

216
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,669
Happy holidays.
Merry Christmas.

217
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,283
So what's your name,
partner?

218
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,114
- It's Timmy.
- Timmy.

219
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,085
Well, to be honest, Timmy,

220
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:27,315
I don't think you deserve
anything this year.

221
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:29,824
I'm joking.

222
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:32,950
You're gonna get everything
on your Christmas list,

223
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:35,359
but if the presents aren't
under the tree tomorrow,

224
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:38,226
you know what happened,
right? Hmm?

225
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:41,289
Well, see, your parents took 'em
and they put 'em on eBay.

226
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:46,061
That's right.
Never trust your parents.

227
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:48,298
And that's all I'm gonna say
on the matter,

228
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,273
lest I get in trouble
with the police.

229
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:52,535
See, they send people
to check on me

230
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:55,543
to make sure I'm not telling kids
the truth about their parents.

231
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,908
So don't go
snitching on me.

232
00:17:57,932 --> 00:17:59,934
Santa'-s little secret, right?
Shake.

233
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,243
All right, superstar.
Now scoot.

234
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,045
Santa sucks.

235
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,483
Ho, ho, ho!
What can I do for you?

236
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:12,613
- I'm Deputy Bradimore.
- I'm Santa-- Santa Claus.

237
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:14,352
Do you go
by any other names?

238
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,450
Yeah, sure.
At Easter, I'm the Easter Bunny.

239
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,484
On Halloween, I'm Halloweener--
an Irish-Jewish ghost.

240
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,427
Days between,
I'm Jim Epstein.

241
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:23,125
And can I call you
Jim Epstein?

242
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,961
Well, you could if you wanted to ruin
the childhoods

243
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:27,661
of all those cute little brats
waiting in line, looking for reassurance

244
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,292
that they're gonna have lots and lots
of toys under the tree come tomorrow.

245
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:32,359
Oh, a cynical Santa-- cute.

246
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:35,269
Ooh, you're good.
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.

247
00:18:35,293 --> 00:18:37,067
You're not from around here,
are you?

248
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:39,735
No, I'm from up north, a small town--
North Pole actually.

249
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:42,607
And Colorado.

250
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:45,168
- You move around a lot?
- What the hell is this?

251
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:47,009
Why the inquisition?
I have a permit.

252
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:48,538
Can I see it?

253
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:51,175
Well, it happens to be
in my journal,

254
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:54,209
because I'm a bit of
a passionate scrapbooker.

255
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:03,018
Mind if I take a look?

256
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:04,491
Knock yourself out.

257
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:07,687
For 10 bucks
you can sit on my lap too.

258
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:10,286
And we'll talk about
the first thing that pops up.

259
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,321
So what's the big issue?

260
00:19:12,353 --> 00:19:16,061
We've been getting some complaints
about your behavior towards children.

261
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,500
Well, if you're talking about
that whiny little brat back there,

262
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,470
I stand by what I said.

263
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,972
I speak the truth.

264
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,497
So what do you want Santa
to bring you, huh?

265
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:29,306
A pony? How about
a big fucking box of reality?

266
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,836
- How about you tone the fuck down?
- Oh, yeah? Or what?

267
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:35,337
You can't revoke my permit.
It was issued by town hall.

268
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,781
It's conditional upon
your adherence to public decency.

269
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:39,976
Ooh, now I'm scared.

270
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:42,612
The big cop lady knows
the letter of the law.

271
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:44,984
So how come
you're not at home tonight,

272
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:47,354
by the fire with your hubby,
baking cookies?

273
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,782
What did you just say?

274
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,657
- Base, patrol one.

275
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:54,719
Deputy Bradimore, come in.

276
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:01,362
Patrol one, over.

277
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,959
Uh, we got a call
from some carolers

278
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:06,994
about a bad smell coming from
that abandoned house on Watson.

279
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:09,405
It's probably a gas leak
or a dead raccoon.

280
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,409
You have to send Giles.
I'm with Santa.

281
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:13,534
Giles is busy.

282
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:16,171
Doing what?
Changing his maxi pad?

283
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,577
A missing persons' report for
Alana Roach. Her husband is here.

284
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,342
Something happen to her?

285
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:24,044
Mm, I think she left him
for Deputy Jordan.

286
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:26,382
- Where did you get that from?
- Gossip.

287
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:27,751
From who?

288
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:30,255
Seriously,
I never reveal my sources.

289
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:42,229
Brought you a newspaper.

290
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:44,287
Couldn't finish the sudoku.

291
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:49,761
Mom and Dad
missed the flight,

292
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,395
so it's just me.

293
00:20:52,424 --> 00:20:54,802
I guess it kind of sucks

294
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:56,362
being in here alone
on Christmas Eve, huh?

295
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:58,671
Hell, you don't even know
what day it is.

296
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:11,111
Anyway.

297
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,517
I gotta go see Tiffany.

298
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:17,652
You remember
my groupie Tiffany, right?

299
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,180
I'm boning her
pretty regular now.

300
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,353
-- You'd better watch out, boy.

301
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:29,829
Christmas Eve is the scariest
damn night of the year.

302
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,854
Gramps, holy shit.

303
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:34,232
You're awake.
Let me go get someone.

304
00:21:34,256 --> 00:21:38,601
You see Santa Claus tonight, boy,
you'd better run.

305
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:41,106
Run for your life.

306
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:51,371
My grandfather-- he's awake.

307
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:57,114
- Mr. McKenzie?
- I swear. He just said something.

308
00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:01,175
Mm. Mr. McKenzie,
it's time for your bath.

309
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,678
He's catatonic.
He hasn't said anything in over a year.

310
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,457
Do you want to help?

311
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:11,859
I'm running kind of late.

312
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:39,702
Ugh.

313
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:11,660
It's disgusting.

314
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,435
Jesus.

315
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:27,055
-- Patrol one, over.

316
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,083
Base. What's the problem?

317
00:24:29,115 --> 00:24:32,220
It's Deputy Jordan.
He's-- he's dead.

318
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,990
Are you sure?

319
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:35,691
I'm pretty damn sure.

320
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,257
He's wrapped
in exploded Christmas lights.

321
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,394
Oh my God. What do you mean?
Like electrocuted?

322
00:24:41,423 --> 00:24:42,801
Oh, shit.

323
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:45,862
You said Alana Roach was with him,
right? I need to go search the house.

324
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:48,271
That does not sound
like a good idea.

325
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,705
Wait for backup. Whoever did it could
still be there. I'll send Sheriff.

326
00:25:04,475 --> 00:25:06,682
Ah, shit.

327
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:08,934
Bradimore, whoa, whoa.
Jesus, stand down.

328
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:15,370
Jesus.

329
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,248
Do you want to go home?

330
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:20,546
No.

331
00:27:20,574 --> 00:27:21,846
You're shaking.

332
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:25,286
Shivering. It's cold.

333
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,619
You should have waited
for me to come.

334
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:29,486
I had to make sure
that she was okay.

335
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:32,151
Look, I'm gonna say this
for your own good.

336
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,627
You're not equipped to handle
this kind of situation.

337
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:38,288
I mean, we both know that.

338
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:44,231
So don't go playing the hero.

339
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,292
That's my job.

340
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:48,132
Oh, Jesus.

341
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:51,036
What a bloody mess.

342
00:27:56,664 --> 00:27:59,041
Whew.

343
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,978
Whoa, a big fella.

344
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:08,416
See, I guess that's what happens
when you try to start a new life.

345
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,440
I told him she was bad news.

346
00:28:10,474 --> 00:28:13,420
I mean, fuck, she was screwing
half the bloody town.

347
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:15,150
Where's the husband now?

348
00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:18,386
Oh, waiting for the bars to open
so he can get drunk.

349
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:21,518
- Should we go talk to him?
- Huh? No, Giles already did.

350
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:24,893
He was at the auto shop all day.
The boss confirms it.

351
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:27,922
No, he didn't do this.

352
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,955
Well, then who did?

353
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:34,368
That level of brutality--
it has to be personal, okay?

354
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:36,997
A stranger just
doesn't make any sense.

355
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:39,199
Murder seldom does.

356
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:45,132
All right, see what you can get
off those footprints.

357
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:47,237
I'm gonna set up our own
command HQ.

358
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,214
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You realize
with Calumet Road closed,

359
00:28:49,235 --> 00:28:50,736
that we're just completely
on our own?

360
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:54,875
Good. No state troopers, no FBI,
Miami."

361
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:57,614
This is payback time
for those parking violations

362
00:28:57,642 --> 00:29:00,555
and stray cats up trees.
And I'll tell you another thing:

363
00:29:00,578 --> 00:29:04,047
This sick fuck is gonna wish
he never set foot in my town.

364
00:29:07,082 --> 00:29:07,348
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
Work it, work it.

365
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,385
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
Work it, work it.

366
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,829
Oh, yeah, lean back.

367
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:14,332
Oh, that's awesome.
You look amazing.

368
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:15,925
Work it, work it.

369
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:18,993
Oh, that's it, that's it. Okay.
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

370
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,867
Oh, baby, you're beautiful.
Stretch your neck out.

371
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,395
Stretch your neck out.
That's it. Ow!

372
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:25,738
Looking like an angel today.

373
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:29,633
Frank is very very--
feeling it, baby.

374
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:32,976
- God, Frank.
- That's right.

375
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:42,942
So your website
can only be seen in Europe?

376
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:44,750
In Europe and Asia.

377
00:29:44,776 --> 00:29:46,345
Awesome.

378
00:29:47,477 --> 00:29:50,923
Oh, your present's over there,
white envelope.

379
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,823
Girl, you rocked it.

380
00:29:56,851 --> 00:29:59,957
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, have a great one, babe.

381
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:04,135
- Mwah. Whoo!
- Later, honey.

382
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:22,541
Creep.

383
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:29,285
Maria, baby!

384
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:31,287
- Ooh, ooh, that's good, the tits.
- You want it off?

385
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:34,051
- Work the tits. Yeah, perfect.
- Yeah, I'll take it off.

386
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:35,648
Work the tits. Work the tits.
Work the tits.

387
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,919
Oh, God. Yeah, that's it.

388
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:41,122
That's it. Oh, man.
You're looking great. That's good.

389
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,965
Tiffany must have
forgotten something.

390
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:50,298
Or maybe the Snowman's back.
We're running low.

391
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:53,664
-- Goldie, get the door.

392
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:55,865
Okay, okay.

393
00:31:01,898 --> 00:31:03,344
Hey.

394
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:08,645
What's this?

395
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:20,354
God, that's amazing.
Look at that. That's unbelievable.

396
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,982
You're looking perfect.

397
00:31:32,154 --> 00:31:33,632
Frank?

398
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:35,792
Yeah, that's it.
What?

399
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:40,064
Frank, run!

400
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,523
No.

401
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:52,111
Frank?

402
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:17,949
Help me. Help me!

403
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:20,187
No!

404
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:24,827
Bastard! No. Please.

405
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:27,357
NO! NO!

406
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,732
Somebody help me, please!

407
00:35:29,758 --> 00:35:31,703
Anybody!

408
00:35:32,693 --> 00:35:35,570
No, no. No!

409
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:37,164
Help me!

410
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:39,300
No, no.

411
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,538
NO! NO!

412
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:43,841
No!

413
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:02,857
Please!

414
00:36:22,896 --> 00:36:25,342
Well, the prints came from
a Cumberland work boot, size 13,

415
00:36:25,365 --> 00:36:26,638
so it's definitely
not Jordan.

416
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:28,666
They didn't deserve
what just happened.

417
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,737
- Well, somebody thought differently.
- What do you mean?

418
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:33,874
What I mean is that this wasn't
like a random,

419
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:37,043
spontaneous act of violence.
Whoever did this had a plan.

420
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:39,212
And whoever had a plan
had a reason.

421
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:41,914
Well, who do you think
could have done this?

422
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,548
Do you remember that article
that you were reading to me

423
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,386
about Christmas making
people crazy?

424
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,790
Holiday murders-
Google that.

425
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:54,488
Sheriff's Department.

426
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,896
It's Crazy Betty.
She sounds a little crazy,

427
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,264
something about blood.

428
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,165
Yeah, a Bloody Mary,
most likely.

429
00:37:01,189 --> 00:37:03,101
-- She's been drinking, guaranteed.

430
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:05,127
Sheriff's Department.

431
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:07,765
Crazy Betty again?

432
00:37:07,795 --> 00:37:11,707
No, a Mrs. Morwood
over on Euclid.

433
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,734
I'll go check it out.

434
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:16,211
Wait, no.

435
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,976
I'll go to the Morwoods'.
I know the family.

436
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,382
Bradimore, you head down to the motel.
Giles, you meet her there.

437
00:37:22,405 --> 00:37:24,749
- Yes, ma'am. Right away.
- I really don't feel well enough

438
00:37:24,774 --> 00:37:26,616
to be fighting crime.

439
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:28,747
I'm probably best served
just holding the fort.

440
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:33,191
No, you are best served protecting
the good citizens of Cryer

441
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:35,591
instead of your own sorry ass.

442
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:37,890
So man up.

443
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:22,021
What happened here?

444
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:25,993
- She's dead.
- No.

445
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:28,624
He skewered her
like a little pig.

446
00:38:28,653 --> 00:38:31,258
What?

447
00:38:31,288 --> 00:38:32,790
Did you see him?

448
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:39,669
I'm really sorry.

449
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,696
I promise you

450
00:38:41,728 --> 00:38:43,605
that we'll catch this maniac

451
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:45,666
and he will pay
for what he did.

452
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,702
- It's all my fault, Sheriff.
- No.

453
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:51,408
- She was driving me crazy.
- It's all right.

454
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:53,676
All I wanted for Christmas
was some relief,

455
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:56,480
but I was talking about
boarding school.

456
00:38:56,506 --> 00:38:59,178
I didn't mean this.
I didn't want this.

457
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,210
It's all right. It's okay.

458
00:39:01,243 --> 00:39:03,722
I deserve to go to jail.

459
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:04,916
No, no, no.

460
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,788
- Take me in.
- Stay there.

461
00:39:07,814 --> 00:39:10,523
Wait. Don't go in there.

462
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,963
Once you see it,
you can't unsee it.

463
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:30,573
-- Bradimore, Giles, come in.

464
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,770
We have another homicide
on Euclid.

465
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:36,473
A 14-year-old girl
appears to be speared.

466
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:38,344
What do you see?

467
00:39:38,371 --> 00:39:41,044
Two dead here, sir.
There's a woman, Goldie Willis,

468
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:45,018
and a Frank Forrester.
He runs a website, soft porn.

469
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:49,547
Porn, drugs-
when did this town become so sleazy?

470
00:39:49,578 --> 00:39:51,080
Ever since the mill closed.

471
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:52,887
They do what they gotta do
to survive.

472
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:57,155
Oh, yeah?
You call this survival?

473
00:39:57,183 --> 00:39:59,356
And, sir, we found prints-
work boots.

474
00:39:59,386 --> 00:40:01,559
- They're huge.
- Looks like the same perp.

475
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:04,329
The woman-- Goldie Willis--
she was the first one to die.

476
00:40:04,356 --> 00:40:07,301
There was no sign of forced entry.
Whoever did this--

477
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,497
she must have known him.
I mean, she opened the door.

478
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:12,904
The last call that Frank made
was to a Mr. Snow.

479
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:15,271
That doesn't ring a bell.

480
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:17,435
I know a Mr. Cloud,
but he's Indian.

481
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:21,377
Native American.

482
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,177
All right, son, listen.
I want you to lock up the crime scene.

483
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:27,672
Oh, and check out
that rat-infested motel.

484
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:30,845
Somebody may have heard
or seen something.

485
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,549
Sir, there's a video camera.

486
00:40:33,576 --> 00:40:36,852
Well, bring the damn thing in.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

for bringing some true
Christmas cheer to the town.

497
00:41:26,948 --> 00:41:30,394
If I could just get one shot
for the parish newsletter?

Oh, you can do
better than that.

Thank you.

504
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,727
Hi, Dennis.

505
00:42:24,354 --> 00:42:26,460
Shouldn't we call in
some help?

506
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:28,231
It's Christmas Eve.

507
00:42:28,258 --> 00:42:30,466
And assuming they could
give a damn,

508
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:32,404
it would be midnight
before anyone showed up.

509
00:42:32,428 --> 00:42:35,637
No, we're just gonna have to
take this maniac down ourselves.

510
00:42:35,664 --> 00:42:38,576
And that is where
our training kicks in.

511
00:42:44,872 --> 00:42:46,714
Hmm.

512
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:48,740
Who is that?

513
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:52,420
Yeah. Later.

514
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,822
- Maybe we should fast-forward it.
- Hmm? What?

515
00:42:54,846 --> 00:42:57,052
- Fast-forward.
- Oh.

516
00:42:57,082 --> 00:43:01,049
I'm just-- I'm just making
a mental note to call the mayor.

517
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:03,495
- About the killings?
- No, about his daughter.

518
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:06,987
You know, just don't want to scare
people unnecessarily.

519
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:10,057
But he's gonna find out sooner or later.
I mean, people are gonna be talking.

520
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:12,398
He'll find out
when I find the killer.

521
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:16,064
Never present to your superiors
a problem.

522
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,666
Always present the solution.

523
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:22,108
Right, here you go.

524
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:34,777
Frank.

525
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:46,682
-- Oh.

526
00:43:46,715 --> 00:43:49,195
God, you scared me to death.

527
00:43:54,655 --> 00:43:58,295
- Giles.
- I'm on my way in.

528
00:43:58,324 --> 00:44:01,236
Listen, we've got a lead
on our killer from the motel.

529
00:44:01,259 --> 00:44:02,966
Yeah, he's wearing a Santa'-s suit
and a mask.

530
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:06,839
Well, that narrows it down, man.
The town square is like Santa central.

531
00:44:06,864 --> 00:44:09,604
Listen, this one's big, all right?
Size 13 boots, over 6 feet. Anyone

532
00:44:09,632 --> 00:44:12,441
matching that description-- you bring
him in immediately for questioning.

533
00:44:12,468 --> 00:44:16,073
That's cute, Aubrey.
I'm gonna need some help.

534
00:44:45,257 --> 00:44:47,259
We're a little crowded tonight.

535
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:50,829
There might be some room
at the front.

536
00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:57,441
I prepared a sermon.

537
00:44:57,467 --> 00:45:00,572
It's just a few words really.

538
00:45:00,603 --> 00:45:03,980
It's about the ugly side
of Christmas,

539
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:06,281
how we surround ourselves

540
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:08,786
with colored lights
and decorations,

541
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:11,516
snow globes and gift wrap,

542
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:13,547
how we convince ourselves

543
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:16,855
that everything
is fun and laughter.

544
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:19,224
Dig a little deeper, friends.

545
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:23,128
Christmas has a dark side too.

546
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:26,290
Remember that chilly night
in Bethlehem

547
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,597
when baby Jesus was born
into this cold world

548
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:34,229
and laid in the filth
of a manger,

549
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,172
when King Herod

550
00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:40,073
massacred infants?

551
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:44,877
Christmas has
some bad memories too.

552
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:48,210
To truly appreciate
the beauty of Christmas,

553
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:50,511
you must understand
its ugliness.

554
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:54,452
Sin is the beating heart
of Christmas-

555
00:45:54,475 --> 00:45:56,612
pain and war.

556
00:45:56,643 --> 00:45:59,146
Fear and sickness,

557
00:45:59,178 --> 00:46:01,850
death and famine,

558
00:46:01,879 --> 00:46:04,519
"American ldol"

00:46:14,656 --> 00:46:17,296

that our Savior

Jesus Christ

00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,149
was born!

574
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:08,795
I won't say a word.

575
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,831
I won't tell a soul.

576
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:17,380
Please don't kill me.

577
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:31,151
One hour till parade time.

578
00:47:52,692 --> 00:47:54,671
Who's the big fellow
in the corner?

579
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:58,232
Stein Karsson,

580
00:47:58,264 --> 00:48:01,267
used to be a foreman
at the mill.

581
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,870
Hmm. Haven't seen him
around before.

582
00:48:03,901 --> 00:48:06,778
I think he lives
up at the motel these days.

583
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:08,304
Crazy Betty's?

584
00:48:08,337 --> 00:48:10,782
No, the Four fucking Seasons.

585
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,182
Nice.

586
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:20,682
- Base.

587
00:48:20,713 --> 00:48:22,954
Brenda, patch me through
to the sheriff, please.

588
00:48:22,981 --> 00:48:24,550
Um...

589
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:30,392
- He's a little tied up.
- It will only take a minute.

590
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:44,871
This better be good.

591
00:48:44,897 --> 00:48:49,538
Listen, Sheriff, there's a man here-
Stein Karsson.

592
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:52,513
He is a former log worker.
He's wearing work boots.

593
00:48:52,536 --> 00:48:55,415
He's huge.
He fits the giant Santa profile.

594
00:48:55,438 --> 00:48:57,440
What's he doing?

595
00:48:57,473 --> 00:48:59,145
Eating a burger.

596
00:48:59,175 --> 00:49:01,120
Well, that doesn't sound like
the kind of thing

597
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:05,612
a serial killer would be partaking of
after five homicides.

598
00:49:05,646 --> 00:49:08,683
He lives up at the motel and
I remember his name from the registry.

599
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:11,388
Hmm, it could be our guy.

600
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:13,895
Where are you?

601
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,988
- Jack's Bar.
- All right, I'm on my way.

602
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:19,227
Just don't do anything stupid.

603
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,258
Gentlemen, ho, ho, ho.

604
00:49:26,226 --> 00:49:29,332
Mr. Karsson?

605
00:49:29,363 --> 00:49:30,933
Stein Karsson?

606
00:49:30,963 --> 00:49:33,967
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

607
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,278
I was wondering when was
the last time you were at the motel.

608
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,304
This morning.

609
00:49:40,337 --> 00:49:43,477
And did you notice
anything unusual,

610
00:49:43,506 --> 00:49:45,043
any new people around?

611
00:49:45,075 --> 00:49:48,020
It's a motel.
People come and go.

612
00:49:48,042 --> 00:49:51,283
But you live there, correct?
You don't know any residents?

613
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:53,313
No.

614
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,860
How about a--

615
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:02,356
a Mr. Snow?

616
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:07,959
No.

617
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:12,529
So do you have any plans
for tonight, for Christmas?

618
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:18,441
I'm gonna spread
as much joy,

619
00:50:18,465 --> 00:50:21,844
as many parcels
of happiness as I can.

620
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:25,210
Then I'm gonna get
my girlfriend so wasted,

621
00:50:25,236 --> 00:50:27,374
she won't even know
if I fuck her in the ass.

622
00:50:29,673 --> 00:50:32,016
You don't seem very happy
about Christmas, do you?

623
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:34,453
Let me tell you
about Christmas.

624
00:50:34,477 --> 00:50:36,855
It ain't all candy canes
and pretty lights.

625
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:41,215
Christmas can fuck you up.

626
00:50:41,248 --> 00:50:44,661
I heard this story.

627
00:50:45,851 --> 00:50:49,856
This fella was pissed
that his wife left him

628
00:50:49,888 --> 00:50:53,062
on account of him being
a dull man.

629
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,660
She took up with
a more exciting fellow.

630
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:57,898
The husband was distraught.

631
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:03,899
He went to the party
they were at

632
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,773
dressed as Santa,

633
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:10,176
took with him a weapon,

634
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:13,044
one he made
with his own hands.

635
00:51:15,805 --> 00:51:19,581
And he set about
killing them that was naughty.

636
00:51:24,178 --> 00:51:28,558
The wife's boyfriend ran,
left her behind.

637
00:51:32,951 --> 00:51:35,260
She begged for forgiveness,

638
00:51:35,286 --> 00:51:37,561
pleaded for her life.

639
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:42,002
He had no mercy for sinners,

640
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:44,231
burnt 'em to a crisp.

641
00:52:05,275 --> 00:52:08,311
He's still doing it too,

642
00:52:08,342 --> 00:52:11,379
every year a new town.

643
00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:15,658
Everyone knows that story.
It's an urban legend.

644
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:19,752
It ain't.

645
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,364
Have you been
a naughty girl, Deputy?

646
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:48,780
Who put you onto me?

647
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:51,376
Was it Frank, that creep?
That kid Dennis?

648
00:52:51,408 --> 00:52:54,082
Just stay calm.

649
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,146
-- Karsson is Mr. Snow.

650
00:52:58,247 --> 00:52:59,748
Hey.

651
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:32,980
Stop.
I can work this out.

652
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:35,780
You can't work shit out.

653
00:53:37,675 --> 00:53:40,655
-- Shit.

654
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:49,455
Are you hurt?

655
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:52,694
No.

656
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:58,458
- Where do you think he went?
- Wherever he feels safe.

657
00:53:58,491 --> 00:54:02,869
Well, I'm on his tail now.

658
00:54:04,294 --> 00:54:07,429
There's nowhere safe.

659
00:54:09,432 --> 00:54:11,809
Ah, shit.

660
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:22,007
- Hello.
- Dad.

661
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,782
Hi, princess.
Let me get your mom.

662
00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:26,378
No.

663
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:28,411
I really need to speak to you.

664
00:54:28,444 --> 00:54:31,391
What's going on?
You sound upset.

665
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,815
I'm not cut out for this job.

666
00:54:34,848 --> 00:54:36,885
Are you kidding?

667
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:38,692
I spent 40 years
on the force.

668
00:54:38,718 --> 00:54:40,822
I know what makes
a good cop, Aubrey.

669
00:54:40,854 --> 00:54:42,855
I'm not.

670
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:46,335
I can't do it.

671
00:54:46,358 --> 00:54:50,100
I mean, maybe before
I lost John

672
00:54:50,128 --> 00:54:54,972
I thought that I was brave

673
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:58,441
and intuitive like you, but...

674
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:02,509
I'm not.

675
00:55:02,535 --> 00:55:04,845
I choked.

676
00:55:04,872 --> 00:55:07,783
Dad, I choked.

677
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:09,843
Trust your gut.

678
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,877
When the time comes,

679
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:14,013
you'll know what to do.

680
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,887
Listen, don't go to the parade
tonight, Dad.

681
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:24,623
We have a situation
with one of the Santas

682
00:55:24,651 --> 00:55:26,927
and he could be
really dangerous.

683
00:55:26,954 --> 00:55:29,024
But don't tell Mom.
I don't want her to worry.

684
00:55:29,054 --> 00:55:31,126
She doesn't have to worry.

685
00:55:31,156 --> 00:55:33,157
This isn't the first time

686
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:36,033
a Bradimore had to bring down
a bad Santa.

687
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:38,131
You'll find him.

688
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:41,369
You'll catch him.

689
00:55:41,397 --> 00:55:43,398
Good bye.

690
00:55:52,205 --> 00:55:54,810
Public enemy number one.

691
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,548
- It's double S.
- Is it?

692
00:55:57,576 --> 00:56:00,078
Karsson-- it's double S.

693
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:03,148
Double S--
double screwed.

694
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:07,025
Listen, the bars will close.
The whole town shuts down.

695
00:56:07,049 --> 00:56:10,393
He can run,
but he can't hide.

696
00:56:10,418 --> 00:56:12,921
I want this son of a bitch
behind bars before dawn,

697
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:14,695
or my aunt's my uncle.

698
00:56:14,722 --> 00:56:16,325
I'm not so sure, Sheriff.

699
00:56:16,356 --> 00:56:18,098
You're not so sure
about what, Deputy?

700
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,398
About Karsson.
He doesn't stack up.

701
00:56:20,424 --> 00:56:22,666
- To what?
- As a suspect.

702
00:56:22,694 --> 00:56:26,265
Don't put avocado
on the burger.

703
00:56:26,297 --> 00:56:27,502
What?

704
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:30,602
Simple is always best.

705
00:56:30,632 --> 00:56:34,602
Look, Karsson killed
Jordan and Alana,

706
00:56:34,635 --> 00:56:37,136
then those two degenerates
at crazy Betty's motel.

707
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,012
Hell, he even tried to kill you,
didn't he? Have you forgotten that?

708
00:56:40,038 --> 00:56:43,383
But Karsson was a coke dealer.
Why would he want to kill his clients

709
00:56:43,408 --> 00:56:46,410
and what would be his motive
for killing Alana and Jordan

710
00:56:46,442 --> 00:56:49,117
and the Morwood girl?
It doesn't make sense, sir, I'm sorry.

711
00:56:49,146 --> 00:56:52,752
There you go again. Now you're
piling hummus on top of the burger too.

712
00:56:52,782 --> 00:56:54,624
What if he was punishing them?

713
00:56:54,649 --> 00:56:56,459
He knew Alana was cheating
on her husband.

714
00:56:56,486 --> 00:56:58,862
He knew that Frank and Goldie
were making porn.

715
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:01,628
And who would know all that?

716
00:57:01,654 --> 00:57:03,759
Someone they knew.
Someone they trusted.

717
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:05,769
You mean, like a drug dealer?

718
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,170
Sir, a drug dealer with morals?
Come on.

719
00:57:08,194 --> 00:57:10,172
All right, I read
Brenda's magazine.

720
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:13,901
Christmas-- the number one holiday
for people going nuts.

721
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,000
That's motive enough for me.

722
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:19,104
So I want you to get out there
and I want you to search every street.

723
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,136
Come on.

724
00:57:22,303 --> 00:57:25,408
Past homicides around the holidays,
state by state.

725
00:57:25,438 --> 00:57:26,940
Thanks.

726
00:57:28,642 --> 00:57:31,850
Double S, my ass.

727
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:03,601
Aubrey.

728
00:58:03,633 --> 00:58:06,204
Joe, hi.

729
00:58:06,235 --> 00:58:09,841
What's this I hear about a dead guy
over on Watson?

730
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:12,679
Someone said the body was
electrocuted.

731
00:58:14,475 --> 00:58:16,852
I don't know anything
about that.

732
00:58:19,645 --> 00:58:22,089
I didn't believe it either.

733
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:31,124
-- Karsson's here, close.

734
00:58:31,152 --> 00:58:32,722
I can smell it--

735
00:58:32,754 --> 00:58:35,530
the smell of fear.

736
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:37,332
I don't smell it.

737
00:58:38,491 --> 00:58:41,334
No. Well, that's not because
you are not attuned.

738
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:44,398
A crime fighter's senses

739
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:48,205
switch to something
almost primeval,

740
00:58:48,231 --> 00:58:52,338
from when we hunted cave bears
and dinosaurs.

741
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:55,143
Sheriff, listen,
I have an article

742
00:58:55,169 --> 00:58:57,671
from Metesca, Montana,
five years ago,

743
00:58:57,704 --> 00:59:01,310
December 26th,
a multiple homicide.

744
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,446
The journal of the Santa from
"The Real Christmas Show"

745
00:59:03,477 --> 00:59:06,217
puts him in Metesca
at the same time.

746
00:59:06,245 --> 00:59:08,121
SQ?

747
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:10,285
We're looking
for the wrong Santa.

748
00:59:10,315 --> 00:59:12,453
Epstein, we're coming in!

749
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,160
Jesus, what a pigsty.

750
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,731
He lives in here?

751
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:24,668
No, he travels in it.
He's living at the motel.

752
00:59:24,692 --> 00:59:26,967
What a smell.

753
00:59:26,993 --> 00:59:29,165
See if you can find
any weapons.

754
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:33,500
We're looking
in the wrong place.

755
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:37,474
Just who the hell
do you think you are, Deputy?

756
00:59:37,501 --> 00:59:41,949
Don't you tell me
how to suss out a perp,

757
00:59:41,972 --> 00:59:45,008
not when you choked
the one time you had the chance.

758
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,543
I fucked up.

759
00:59:47,576 --> 00:59:50,784
Okay? I fucked up, sir.

760
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:54,552
I have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

761
00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:00,659
You can trust me.

771

I will, honey bunch,

772
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:42,014
January 1st.

773
01:00:42,047 --> 01:00:44,287
It'll be my
New Year's resolution.

774
01:00:44,314 --> 01:00:46,796
I love you.

775
01:00:46,817 --> 01:00:49,023
At least one of my girls
is still sweet.

776
01:00:49,052 --> 01:00:51,191
Now you go get ready
for bed, okay?

777
01:00:51,222 --> 01:00:53,200
Only if you say good night.

778
01:00:53,222 --> 01:00:55,463
I will.

779
01:00:59,127 --> 01:01:01,003
Come here.

780
01:01:02,828 --> 01:01:04,501
What are you doing
out here?

781
01:01:04,529 --> 01:01:06,634
Tiffany says
you finished the guesthouse.

782
01:01:06,665 --> 01:01:10,372
It's a doozy--
two bedrooms and a full bath.

783
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:12,402
I'm gonna show him.

784
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,778
- Make it snappy.
- Oh, yeah.

785
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:18,079
I want us all to drive into town
for the parade.

786
01:01:18,105 --> 01:01:20,416
This won't take long.

787
01:01:38,722 --> 01:01:40,292
Jesus.

788
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:42,324
Mayor Revie.

789
01:01:42,357 --> 01:01:45,393
Hi, sir. I just wanted
to wish you a Merry Christmas.

790
01:01:45,426 --> 01:01:48,406
Merry Christmas, Sheriff,
to you and the whole department.

791
01:01:48,428 --> 01:01:51,408
Thanks for another year
of keeping our town safe.

792
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:53,603
I wanted to talk to you
about that, sir.

793
01:01:53,633 --> 01:01:56,009
We have reason to believe

794
01:01:56,034 --> 01:01:58,980
that we have a serial killer

795
01:01:59,003 --> 01:02:01,279
at large in our community.

796
01:02:02,838 --> 01:02:05,319
Yes, I know, sir.
It is shocking.

797
01:02:05,342 --> 01:02:07,341
I am doing everything
in my power

798
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:11,186
to make sure that this maniac
doesn't strike again.

799
01:02:11,211 --> 01:02:13,622
You're breaking up, sir.
I can't--

800
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,887
Hello? Hello?

801
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:20,189
Hello.

802
01:02:20,217 --> 01:02:23,163
-- Bloody cell phones.

803
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:26,197
Poor Santa Claus,

804
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:28,724
giving out a million gifts,

805
01:02:28,757 --> 01:02:32,568
never getting anything in return
except stale cookies.

806
01:02:34,395 --> 01:02:36,395
It's true.

807
01:02:36,429 --> 01:02:38,773
Santa gets shafted.

808
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:40,799
Well...

809
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,705
it's time to give back.

810
01:02:46,737 --> 01:02:49,479
I'm gonna lighten
Santa's sack.

811
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:56,014
Ho, ho, ho.

812
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:03,193
It looks like Santa's gonna
come early this year.

813
01:03:05,717 --> 01:03:08,028
-- Shit.

814
01:03:08,054 --> 01:03:11,397
Is that my dad?

815
01:03:11,423 --> 01:03:13,424
Don't stop.

816
01:03:16,825 --> 01:03:19,704
I have a surprise for you.

817
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:21,729
Stay here.

818
01:03:32,002 --> 01:03:35,710
- Have you been bad?
- Fuck, yeah, I have.

819
01:04:05,794 --> 01:04:08,671
I'm ready
when you are, killer.

820
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:36,486
Okay, I'm not laughing anymore.
You can-

821
01:04:39,351 --> 01:04:41,525
You dick!

822
01:04:41,553 --> 01:04:44,966
You should have seen your face-
classic.

823
01:04:47,224 --> 01:04:49,328
How did you get over here
without me seeing you?

824
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:51,360
Get over where?

825
01:04:51,394 --> 01:04:54,272
How did you get
from the bathroom

826
01:04:54,296 --> 01:04:57,708
to the other side of the bed
without me seeing you?

827
01:04:57,732 --> 01:05:00,337
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wasn't in the bathroom.

828
01:05:00,368 --> 01:05:02,438
Okay, so the door opened
by itself?

829
01:05:03,471 --> 01:05:05,780
Stop trying to scare me,
asshole.

830
01:05:05,805 --> 01:05:08,079
You know what?
I'm over this now.

831
01:05:08,106 --> 01:05:10,608
Fuck. Come on.

832
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:14,178
Look, there's nothing.

833
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:16,211
Come on, stop fucking around
and let's--

834
01:05:25,084 --> 01:05:27,495
Tiffany!

835
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:29,896
Let me out of here!

836
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,092
What the fuck?

837
01:05:52,971 --> 01:05:54,540
Hey! Open LIP!

838
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,898
Tiffany!

839
01:07:22,602 --> 01:07:25,548
Santa, you forgot
the cookies.

840
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:34,713
He's a wolf
in sheep's clothing,

841
01:07:34,744 --> 01:07:36,882
hiding in plain sight.

842
01:07:36,912 --> 01:07:39,553
I'll call Brenda,
get a vehicle description

843
01:07:39,582 --> 01:07:41,686
and a license plate
for Jim Epstein.

844
01:07:41,716 --> 01:07:43,717
He's Santa Claus,
remember?

845
01:07:43,749 --> 01:07:46,127
The parade is
the perfect cover.

846
01:07:46,152 --> 01:07:48,495
Nah, he'll be on foot.

847
01:07:52,423 --> 01:07:53,994
-- Is there any way

848
01:07:54,026 --> 01:07:55,697
we can call off
the parade?

849
01:07:55,726 --> 01:07:57,728
I spoke to the mayor,
told him

850
01:07:57,761 --> 01:07:59,602
I had the situation
under control.

851
01:07:59,629 --> 01:08:02,108
Listen, this freak
can't hide forever.

852
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,269
Sooner or later
they all make mistakes.

853
01:08:24,581 --> 01:08:26,992
Ho, ho, ho!

854
01:08:28,252 --> 01:08:30,560
Merry Christmas.

855
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:39,998
Watch out, man.

856
01:08:40,025 --> 01:08:41,560
Watch it, buddy.

857
01:08:41,593 --> 01:08:42,970
Fake-ass Santas.

858
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:45,667
Shit, are you seeing this?
It's Epstein.

859
01:08:45,696 --> 01:08:47,869
Hey, look out, man.
Come here.

860
01:08:49,765 --> 01:08:52,209
Shit, he's making a run for it.

861
01:08:54,534 --> 01:08:56,514
- Is that a gun?
- Get out of the way.

862
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:12,421
Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho, ho!

863
01:09:20,653 --> 01:09:22,691
Merry Christmas.

864
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:30,332
Oh.

865
01:09:40,268 --> 01:09:42,804
- Hold still!
- Freeze!

866
01:09:42,835 --> 01:09:46,511
You nasty,
sadistic little prick.

867
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:48,519
See?

868
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:50,781
I told you I'd get him.

869
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:52,311
Cuff him.

870
01:09:53,312 --> 01:09:55,758
Get over here.
Cast your mind back,

871
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:58,486
Christmas, '03.
Remember where you were?

872
01:09:58,514 --> 01:10:01,984
Probably some herpes-ridden
crotch of a town like this, I suspect.

873
01:10:02,016 --> 01:10:04,758
- Deputy.
- Metesca, Montana.

874
01:10:04,786 --> 01:10:08,289
Does that ring a bell
in that dumb skull of yours yet?

875
01:10:08,323 --> 01:10:11,565
My mind is blissfully bereft
of the effects of campanology.

876
01:10:11,592 --> 01:10:15,232
Yeah, well, four people were
murdered there Christmas Eve.

877
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:17,637
The cops never found the killer.

878
01:10:18,996 --> 01:10:22,875
Judicial ineptness is
a universal curse. I fucking weep.

879
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:25,573
Yeah, well, six people
died here tonight.

880
01:10:25,602 --> 01:10:29,446
I ask you,
what are the chances?

881
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,848
I'd say the odds of that
are pretty high.

882
01:10:36,109 --> 01:10:38,781
Because it's that time
of the year, Sheriff.

883
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:42,053
Yeah, Christmas,

884
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,319
when people
go off the deep end.

885
01:10:44,349 --> 01:10:46,350
Yeah, you know why.

886
01:10:46,382 --> 01:10:48,487
'Cause they spend too much

887
01:10:48,517 --> 01:10:50,393
and they drink too much
and they eat too much

888
01:10:50,418 --> 01:10:52,397
and they think too much.

889
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:54,626
And they look around at all that
fake fun and happy laughter

890
01:10:54,655 --> 01:10:57,828
and they go, "Where the fuck
is my cup of joy, huh?

891
01:10:57,856 --> 01:11:00,894
Where is my figgy pudding?

892
01:11:00,926 --> 01:11:02,997
Where's my stocking
full of gifts?

893
01:11:03,028 --> 01:11:05,973
Where's my Calvin Klein underwear,
my cable TV,

894
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:09,135
my replica Tim Tebow
NFL jersey?

895
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:11,166
Where's my fancy cologne?

896
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:14,374
Where's my gift-wrapped
Norman Rockwell wife,

897
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:17,542
huh, and my beautiful,
happy, smiling children?

898
01:11:17,571 --> 01:11:19,573
Where?

899
01:11:19,606 --> 01:11:21,551
Nowhere.

900
01:11:21,574 --> 01:11:23,577
Where are my friends,

901
01:11:23,609 --> 01:11:26,487
my beaming friends who worship
the fucking ground I walk on

902
01:11:26,511 --> 01:11:28,786
because I've had an awesome
fucking year, man?"

903
01:11:28,812 --> 01:11:31,655
And it doesn't take much
to put people over the edge, huh-uh.

904
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:34,457
Mm-mm, just a dirty look

905
01:11:34,483 --> 01:11:36,622
or a bad word, yeah,

906
01:11:36,652 --> 01:11:38,654
or a TV too loud

907
01:11:38,687 --> 01:11:41,667
or some asshole behind you
leaning on his horn.

908
01:11:41,689 --> 01:11:44,533
Ring-ring! It's a telemarketer,
"Give me money for Haiti,"

909
01:11:44,558 --> 01:11:47,264
or the Democrats,
or National Suck-My-Dick Week.

910
01:11:47,292 --> 01:11:50,865
It's the most wonderful
fucking time of the year!

911
01:11:53,899 --> 01:11:57,607
But whatever it is
that you guys think I did,

912
01:11:57,635 --> 01:11:59,636
I most certainly did not.

913
01:12:11,511 --> 01:12:14,514
Yeah! I'm Santa!

914
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,888
Who the fuck do you think it is I am?
Charles Manson?

915
01:12:26,121 --> 01:12:28,259
I don't understand
how he did it.

916
01:12:28,289 --> 01:12:31,200
How does he go from
hearing kids' wishes

917
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:33,225
to going on a killing spree?
It just-

918
01:12:33,259 --> 01:12:36,034
it doesn't make sense.

919
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:39,405
I told you before,
murder seldom does.

920
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:42,343
I want you to go look for
that other girl from the motel

921
01:12:42,366 --> 01:12:45,175
and see if you can find
any more evidence.

922
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,203
You're good at that, yeah.

923
01:12:47,236 --> 01:12:50,614
Giles and I will man the fort.

924
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,969
What the fuck?

925
01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:27,700
Karsson.

926
01:13:27,733 --> 01:13:30,178
Turn around.

927
01:13:32,302 --> 01:13:34,474
Turn around.

928
01:13:36,939 --> 01:13:39,475
Turn around now!

929
01:13:40,508 --> 01:13:43,282
Show me your hands.

930
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,619
Show me your hands, Karsson!

931
01:13:49,213 --> 01:13:52,387
Don't make me laugh.

932
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:56,831
We both know
you don't have it in you.

933
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,863
Six-sided item--

934
01:14:56,896 --> 01:14:59,433
"snowflake."

935
01:14:59,464 --> 01:15:01,466
Of course.

936
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,422
Oh, my God.

937
01:15:20,881 --> 01:15:22,656
Hi, you've reached
the Bradimores.

938
01:15:22,683 --> 01:15:23,715
- Leave a message.
- Shit, shit, shit!

939
01:15:23,715 --> 01:15:24,818
- Leave a message.
- Shit, shit, shit!

940
01:15:28,985 --> 01:15:30,726
Guess I'll be heading home.

941
01:15:30,755 --> 01:15:32,598
Oh, yeah, huh?

942
01:15:32,622 --> 01:15:34,657
Well, Merry Christmas then, eh?

943
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:37,671
♪ We wish you
a merry Christmas ♪

944
01:15:37,693 --> 01:15:40,228
♪ And a happy new year. ♪

945
01:15:41,863 --> 01:15:43,773
What do you think this is,
"Glee"?

946
01:15:45,298 --> 01:15:47,005
Go home.

947
01:15:50,202 --> 01:15:53,012
Hey, and take the trash
while you're at it.

948
01:15:59,373 --> 01:16:01,978
What is this,
garbage day?

949
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:25,465
Hello?

950
01:16:33,599 --> 01:16:35,772
What now, Deputy?

951
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:38,714
Listen, the red-and-white gift box
is a marker. He's marking his victims.

952
01:16:38,736 --> 01:16:41,511
Don't be ridiculous.
I've got the killer

953
01:16:41,538 --> 01:16:43,539
sitting in my jailhouse.

954
01:16:43,572 --> 01:16:47,041
Listen, we got a box ourselves.
I'm going home to check on my parents.

955
01:16:47,075 --> 01:16:48,577
Calm down.

956
01:16:55,015 --> 01:16:57,324
A lump of coal?

957
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:12,562
Son of a bitch.

958
01:17:15,997 --> 01:17:18,101
Oh, big mistake,

959
01:17:18,131 --> 01:17:21,340
bringing a flamethrower
to a gunfight.

960
01:17:27,538 --> 01:17:29,519
Mom! Dad!

961
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:32,918
Mom! Dad! Mom!

962
01:17:42,715 --> 01:17:44,491
Dad?

963
01:18:05,064 --> 01:18:07,169
No.

964
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:27,726
Aubrey!

965
01:18:27,748 --> 01:18:29,852
He tried to stop him,

966
01:18:29,883 --> 01:18:31,828
that monster!

967
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,455
- No!
- Mom, Mom, stop, stop, stop.

968
01:18:34,486 --> 01:18:36,362
Look at me.
Look at me.

969
01:18:36,387 --> 01:18:38,697
I'm going to go get him.

970
01:18:38,723 --> 01:18:40,429
- I'm going to go get him.
- No, no, no.

971
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:43,904
No, no, Aubrey.
It's not safe!

972
01:20:06,686 --> 01:20:09,130
What's with the fucking rain?

973
01:20:33,405 --> 01:20:35,681
Hey, you asshole,

974
01:20:35,707 --> 01:20:37,982
get me out of here.

975
01:20:41,811 --> 01:20:45,258
Which fucking dickwad deputy
are you, man?

976
01:20:45,281 --> 01:20:48,285
I just want to get the names right
on the complaint form.

977
01:20:51,052 --> 01:20:53,053
Deaf and dumb, huh?

978
01:20:53,086 --> 01:20:55,226
All right, fucking retard,
out of my way.

979
01:21:01,126 --> 01:21:03,127
Oh, you want to rumble, huh?

980
01:21:03,162 --> 01:21:04,663
Okay.

981
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:07,230
Fuck you.
Fuck Christmas.

982
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:09,265
And fuck your plastic face.

983
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:15,169
Not nice.

984
01:21:15,201 --> 01:21:17,375
Oh, not nice?
I'm sorry.

985
01:22:48,136 --> 01:22:50,138
Brenda!

986
01:23:39,173 --> 01:23:41,448
- Help!
- Brenda!

987
01:24:16,199 --> 01:24:17,701
You fucking bastard!

988
01:24:17,735 --> 01:24:19,645
My father was a good man.

989
01:26:33,032 --> 01:26:35,034
- Help!
- Brenda!

990
01:26:35,067 --> 01:26:37,545
Help me!

991
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,570
Brenda.

992
01:26:43,371 --> 01:26:45,782
You're okay.
Get up. Get up.

993
01:28:40,756 --> 01:28:42,532
Drop your weapon!

994
01:28:44,825 --> 01:28:48,294
Ronald, please,
don't make me do this!
