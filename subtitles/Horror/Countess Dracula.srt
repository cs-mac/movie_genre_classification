1
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,702
Come on.

2
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,357
Sorry.

3
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,272
The bailiff summoned him.

4
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,908
It was the Count's wish that
he should be here for the will.

5
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,889
Amen.

6
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,099
Countess, your husband
promised me work.

7
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,351
Be off! Away with you!

8
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,104
My wife and boys are starving!

9
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,565
In God's name, he promised!

10
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,900
He promised!

11
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,034
Down! Get off there! Get off!

12
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,122
They've run over Janos!

13
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,039
- Father!
- Come on!

14
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,167
Well, come on.
What are you waiting for?

15
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,259
Yah! Yah!

16
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,928
Father!

17
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,634
Devil woman!

18
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,102
Devil! Devil!

19
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,813
Go on.

20
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:08,166
Now, before we proceed to business,
may I present Imre Toth,

21
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,219
the son of your husband's
late friend General Toth.

22
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,848
The Countess Elisabeth Nádasdy.

23
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,263
Captain Dobi,
the steward of the castle.

24
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,058
Master Fabio, the historian.

25
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,562
And the Countess's companion, Julie.

26
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,149
The one person not
yet arrived is Ilona,

27
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,276
the Countess's daughter.

28
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,737
Her father sent for her
when he knew he was dying,

29
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,364
but, alas, too late...

30
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,950
Yes, yes. Let's get on with it.

31
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,542
Please.

32
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:55,387
"The last will and testament
of Count Ferenc Nádasdy.

33
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,182
To Captain Dobi...

34
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,769
I bequeath my arms and uniforms."

35
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,228
"To Julie Szentes,

36
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,771
1,000 koronas

37
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,608
and food and lodging in my
home for the rest of her days.

38
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,828
To Master Fabio, my library."

39
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,993
"To Imre Toth,

40
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,704
son of my dearest friend
and army companion,

41
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,580
who fought gallantly with me

42
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,417
and saved my life on
more than one occasion,

43
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,920
I bequeath my famous stable

44
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,847
with all the horses and the cottage.

45
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,896
To my beloved wife, Elisabeth...

46
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,735
my fortunes and estates t...

47
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:59,409
to be divided equally with
our only child, Ilona."

48
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,752
Well, we must respect his wishes.

49
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,916
- That concludes the main...
- Countess, I must apologize...

50
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,877
for my late arrival.

51
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,253
My horse lost a shoe.

52
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:22,807
Well, now you have all the horseshoes
you'll need... and the horses.

53
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,805
Since we are new neighbors,

54
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,767
doubtless we shall see
much of each other.

55
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,143
The honor will be mine.

56
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,104
"...half a kilo of tobacco yearly.

57
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,775
Sendrey family,
5 forint extra money monthly

58
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,778
and my cottage..."

59
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,821
You wish to see these famous stables?

60
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,865
- Indeed.
- Ah, come this way.

61
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,368
"...5 forint extra money monthly.

62
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,620
And to Miklós Sendrey,

63
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,006
one of my ivory pipes with
half a kilo of tobacco yearly."

64
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,044
It seems you've inherited
a fine library.

65
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,338
Oh, the best in the land.

66
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,299
You cannot imagine
my delight. This way.

67
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,677
And you, my friend...
you, too, I feel are a scholar.

68
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:10,188
Oh, I don't know. I try
to read as much as I can.

69
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,190
What was she carrying?

70
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,858
A pan of coals...

71
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:24,237
the solace of widows
and lonely ghouls.

72
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,663
It makes cold beds hot.

73
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,619
Cold beds hot.

74
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,088
It makes cold beds hot.

75
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,641
But there are worse places
to live, and when Ilona returns...

76
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,017
Has she been away long?

77
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,561
Since she was 6 years old.

78
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,730
They sent her to Vienna to
escape the dreaded Turks.

79
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,992
But I'm told that God has favored her.
She's a great beauty.

80
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,198
20 years as steward of this castle,
protector of his lady,

81
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,575
and what do I get for it?

82
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,411
Two suits of armor and a
trunk full of old uniforms.

83
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,037
Ha!

84
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,415
What did you expect?

85
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,292
You think he was a fool?

86
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,585
You're quite right, of course.

87
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:21,627
Who am I to complain,

88
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,548
when in truth he has left me
the greatest prize of all.

89
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,426
I did not realize I was
bequeathed to you.

90
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,470
Well, you're free now.

91
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,271
To choose whom I please.

92
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,278
You wish me to burn myself, wench?!

93
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,788
Quickly, cold water!

94
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:57,413
Have I a rival?
Our new neighbor, perhaps?

95
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:02,168
Countess, I've loved you for 20 years.
I've waited patiently for this day.

96
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,928
Please go. I wish to take my bath.

97
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,307
Leave me.

98
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,444
It's cooler now, madam.

99
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,739
Cooler?

100
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,701
Peel me a peach.

101
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,663
What are you trying to do,
turn my room into a pigsty?

102
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,997
My hands are burned!

103
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,923
Oh, get out!

104
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,844
Go!

105
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,488
Dobi!

106
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,622
Julie!

107
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:23,131
It's the blood, the girl's blood.

108
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,877
Bring her to me.

109
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,462
What do you want with her?

110
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,256
Bring the girl to me!

111
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,841
Please.

112
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,303
Oh, find some other amusement
for yourself. Excuse me!

113
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,686
Julie...

114
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,195
Julie, you'll help me.

115
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,866
You'll help me, Julie.

116
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,989
All right, I'll fetch her myself.

117
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,623
Take me to her room, now!

118
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,377
Now!

119
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,224
Don't be frightened.

120
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,435
<i>Ring-a-ring o' roses</i>

121
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,646
<i>A pocket full of posies</i>

122
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,689
<i>A-tishoo! A-tishoo!</i>

123
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,324
<i>We all fall down!</i>

124
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,779
<i>Ring-a-ring o' roses</i>

125
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,114
<i>A pocket full of posies</i>

126
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,033
<i>A-tishoo! A-tishoo!</i>

127
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,077
<i>We all fall down!</i>

128
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,037
She went up to the
Countess's room last night,

129
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,872
and that's the last I saw of her.

130
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,749
Her bed isn't slept in.

131
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,168
Oh, Captain...

132
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,506
Have you seen my daughter, Teri,
the Countess's chambermaid?

133
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,216
She's disappeared.

134
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,509
I'm so worried.

135
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,012
How should I know where she is?

136
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,516
Try the whorehouse.

137
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,769
She'd never do that.
She's a pure girl.

138
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,404
He'd know if she was
in the whorehouse.

139
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,831
Dobi! Julie!

140
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,020
What have you done?

141
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,685
Oh, Dobi.

142
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,770
- Where is she?
- Who?

143
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,188
The girl, your chambermaid.

144
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,733
Look at me, Dobi.

145
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,158
Look at me.

146
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,741
And what will your daughter say?

147
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,076
She arrives tomorrow...

148
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,371
and she'll find you
as young as she is.

149
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,505
Will she?

150
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,850
Come on, you! Out!

151
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,621
Oh! Let me go!

152
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,292
Let me go!

153
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,996
Take her.

154
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,290
Oh, you beast!

155
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,459
- Here!
- Let me go!

156
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,086
Oh, please!

157
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,679
Please, let me go!

158
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,474
Oh, there you are.

159
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,097
Oh, are you satisfied?

160
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,808
As you are with your library.

161
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,101
- Come, ride with me.
- No.

162
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,687
No, no, no. The creatures terrify me.

163
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,647
But I brought you a map
for fear of losing you.

164
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,691
Oh, thank you.

165
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,776
And the Countess would
deem it a pleasure

166
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,196
if you would dine with us tonight.

167
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:08,200
Don't look so miserable.
The fair Ilona arrived at dawn.

168
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,912
I haven't seen her yet.
She's been closeted with her mother.

169
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,163
I'm persuaded.

170
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,291
We dine at 7:00.

171
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,334
Bye!

172
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,503
How do I look?

173
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,755
Do you think our new neighbor
will find me irresistible?

174
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,509
Oh! Is there anyone
who can resist you?

175
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,969
Oh, Julie!

176
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,304
We're in luck.

177
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,140
The Countess is overcome with
the reunion with her daughter

178
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,850
and will take dinner in her room.

179
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,643
Oh, good. And the daughter?

180
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,278
Oh, she'll be down.

181
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,701
Well, you two have met, I believe.

182
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,035
My dear, young lady.
Do you remember me?

183
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,711
My dear Master Fabio.

184
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,710
Have I changed so much?

185
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,590
As a flower changes
from bud to bloom...

186
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,432
past recognition.

187
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,014
Oh, this is my young
friend Imre Toth.

188
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,974
My mother has spoken of you.

189
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,728
I believe your father and mine
were the closest of friends.

190
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,606
Your mother, I hope
she's not too unwell.

191
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,024
Oh, merely fatigued.

192
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,527
She wishes us to remove
her from our minds

193
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,947
and to enjoy ourselves this evening.

194
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,997
Shall we eat, then?

195
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,577
That is your mother's chair.

196
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,046
Ah, yes, of course.

197
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,084
Don't you remember
any of your life here?

198
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,211
Oh, yes, many things.

199
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,761
One story in particular.

200
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,131
The day of my departure...

201
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,801
I offer a toast to the new arrival...

202
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,260
Oh, a toast.

203
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,764
In the wine so much loved
by her dear father.

204
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,058
Not only the taste, he used
to say, but the color...

205
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,519
the color of bull's blood.

206
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,437
Ilona.

207
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,231
Ilona.

208
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,525
Pray continue with
your delightful story.

209
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,777
Oh, but I cannot remember.

210
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,153
The day of your departure.

211
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,071
Ah, yes.

212
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,031
I was swimming in the lake

213
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,625
when I spied a man on
the bank cutting roses.

214
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:20,124
The finest full-blooded blooms.

215
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,375
Who could it be?

216
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,794
The gardener?

217
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,921
No, he was too upright of bearing.

218
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,548
A thief?

219
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,100
He was just too far away
from me to recognize him.

220
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,931
And modesty forbade me
from leaving the water.

221
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,142
Modesty!

222
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:43,814
Later, I saw the same roses
in my mother's bedroom.

223
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,358
I asked her who had
given them to her,

224
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,862
and she said,
"One of my secret lovers."

225
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,698
Enchanting.

226
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,785
I was confused. What could she mean?

227
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,455
She promised to tell
me when I grew up.

228
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,751
And tonight, before I
came down to dinner,

229
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,795
I had my answer.

230
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,505
And the name of the man...

231
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,715
Ah?

232
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,183
It was Uncle Dobi!

233
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,018
But I have talked
enough about myself.

234
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,228
Help me rediscover my home

235
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:27,191
and tell me about your life,
and your plans, and your family.

236
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,284
Well, I really don't
know where to begin.

237
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,623
Uncle Dobi!

238
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,929
No! I want to get out!

239
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,523
I want to get out!

240
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,145
This way.

241
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,771
Very nice.

242
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,356
Raphael. Do you like it?

243
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,358
- Raphael?
- Yes.

244
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,325
I like it.

245
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,865
- My grandfather.
- Hmm.

246
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,702
His weakness was women.
He died in the arms of a kitchen maid.

247
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,246
Hmm? Then I salute him.

248
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,186
It's the only way to die.

249
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,043
His wife.

250
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,462
Hmm.

251
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,388
No doubt a great beauty of her time.

252
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,603
Shh, quietly past my mother's room.

253
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,352
And this is your father.

254
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,105
What a brave and generous man he was.

255
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,982
Yes.

256
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,985
Hmm.

257
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,778
Does he look as you remember him?

258
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,322
Oh, much the same.

259
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,831
Come with me. Come, quickly.

260
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,953
Will you live here now with your
mother or return to Vienna?

261
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,996
I haven't decided yet. And you?

262
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,833
Oh, I feel already this is my home...

263
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,677
the first proper home of my life.

264
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,216
But the war is not yet over,
and I may be recalled to duty.

265
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,803
But until that happens, I shall stay.

266
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,807
And if you leave, I swear
to you, I shall take my horses...

267
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,058
All of them?

268
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,192
All of them... and follow you.

269
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,738
But I am unworthy of
such a sacrifice.

270
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,658
Let me be the judge of that.

271
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,078
Oh, no.

272
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,630
We have our reputations to think of.

273
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,875
We've only just met.

274
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,342
When can I see you again?

275
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,922
Sunday. We'll ride
together on Sunday.

276
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,515
Two days? Impossible!

277
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,343
Tomorrow, then.

278
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,763
But late, when the others are asleep.

279
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,433
You'll come to the small
door below the tower,

280
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,518
and I will put a
candle in the window.

281
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,729
That will mean all is well.

282
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,488
Oh, but now you must go.

283
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:01,840
Tell me, Nanny, how do
you find our little mistress?

284
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,718
Has she not exceeded
your wildest dreams?

285
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,887
In what way, Master Fabio?

286
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,347
Well, in every way.

287
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,350
A girl of barely 19 years, so...

288
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,270
mature of bearing, wit, and manners.

289
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,563
Indeed?

290
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,483
You know, one thing puzzles me.

291
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,569
I always thought she
resembled her father.

292
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,912
Now she's the image of her mother!

293
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,870
Oh, don't you share my feelings?

294
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,040
I think you grow old, Master Fabio.

295
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,334
And your memory's confused.

296
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,252
Then let that pass.

297
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,970
One never quarrels with a nurse.

298
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,477
Unless one wants a box on the ears!

299
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,898
Box on the ears!

300
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,031
Oh!

301
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,053
Come on. Quietly.

302
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:09,134
Shh. Shh.

303
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,268
Quietly.

304
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,431
It's... It's impossible.

305
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,941
Ah!

306
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,734
My darling.

307
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,660
I thought today would never end.

308
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,334
Say you love me.

309
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,872
- Say it.
- Yes.

310
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,591
Yes, yes, I love you. Yes.

311
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:11,323
Julie!

312
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,361
Julie.

313
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,528
Countess?

314
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,746
Oh, Julie!

315
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,495
Oh, Julie, please don't
let him see me like this!

316
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,290
Send him away!
Please, Julie, send him away!

317
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,502
Roll up, everybody!
All the fun of the circus!

318
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,879
In the marketplace tonight!

319
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,965
See the animals...
lions, monkeys, camels.

320
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,967
The Indian fakir walking on nails.

321
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,762
The fattest woman in the world.

322
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,348
Join the gypsies dancing!

323
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,392
Roll up! Roll up!

324
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,185
All the fun of the circus!

325
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,562
In the marketplace tonight!

326
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,572
Music!

327
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,412
Don't you want to see me
young and happy again?

328
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,831
So that you can make
love to young officers?

329
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,917
I'd rather have you as you are

330
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,419
than see you parading yourself

331
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,546
like some jaded young
slut from the whorehouse.

332
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,298
At least there's dignity in age!

333
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,758
You are cruel.

334
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,509
You have never loved me.

335
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,179
Oh, yes, I've loved you.

336
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,473
But can't you see what will happen?

337
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,892
You'll go insane...

338
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,935
or the bailiffs will
take you and hang you.

339
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,938
If that should happen,
then don't forget...

340
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,073
you'll be there next to me.

341
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,863
- Have you spoken to him?
- Yes, my dear.

342
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,239
He was not offended.

343
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,785
I told him you left because you
heard your mother calling for you.

344
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,961
And he hopes you'll go riding
with him today as you arranged.

345
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,542
Riding with him?

346
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,919
But how can I?

347
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,678
How can I go riding with him?

348
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,016
Julie...

349
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,605
You will find me someone
and bring her here.

350
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,892
Yes, Countess.

351
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,729
But first tell me what news of
the little one, our real daughter?

352
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,939
I'm so anxious.

353
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,740
She should be here by now.

354
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:04,329
- But didn't Captain Dobi tell you?
- No.

355
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,827
The Danube flooded where
she would've crossed.

356
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,372
Oh, my poor child.

357
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,249
She is quite safe.

358
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,467
Now, Julie, do as I ask.

359
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,355
Countess.

360
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:37,028
Will the Countess have
her fortune told?

361
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,658
Two days she's been gone,
and no news of her.

362
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,786
If you ask me, that Countess
knows what's happened to her.

363
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,373
Yes, tell him how the old
witch used to treat her.

364
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,959
Tell him how she used
to burn her and hit her.

365
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,253
Aye, yes, that's right, she did.

366
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,629
Quiet!

367
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,340
You stupid, ignorant people!

368
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,925
Show a bit of respect
for the Countess!

369
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,385
Why should we?

370
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,096
For your food and the
warmth of this kitchen!

371
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,639
And the guns of the
soldiers that protect you

372
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,183
from the Turks and the outlaws!

373
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,436
You ungrateful lot.

374
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,855
You're the envy of the village,
you know that?

375
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:22,317
So be satisfied and
keep your mouths shut!

376
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,028
I just want to see my Teri again.

377
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,662
My little girl.

378
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,825
I just want to see her again.

379
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,784
Alive.

380
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,829
She'll turn up. They always do.

381
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,000
Probably hiding out in
the forest somewhere.

382
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,170
Anyway, how many other
children have you got?

383
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,963
Seven.

384
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,007
Well, what are you worrying about?

385
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,893
You won't know the difference!

386
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,309
I see a new love in your life.

387
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,896
He will lift away the black
veil of your widowhood,

388
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,190
and you will be young
in your heart again.

389
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,692
Thank you, my child.

390
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,618
Julie?

391
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,631
Beautiful!

392
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,167
Oh, it's beautiful!

393
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:29,467
Oh, it's beautiful!

394
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,470
Oh!

395
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,179
You'll forgive me for last night?

396
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,141
Mm.

397
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,525
Julie explained everything.

398
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,192
How's your mother?

399
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,777
A little better.

400
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,864
- Still confined to her room.
- Yes.

401
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,533
My father's death. My own homecoming.

402
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,077
She'll be better.

403
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,454
She'll be...

404
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,755
very much better.

405
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,126
You're...

406
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,010
Yes?

407
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,513
You're so beautiful.

408
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,826
Jump!

409
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,996
- Just look at that.
- Yes.

410
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,707
Come on.

411
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,420
What is it?

412
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,389
Nothing.

413
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:18,344
I just can't get used to my
good fortune, that's all.

414
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,180
Two weeks ago I was just another
young soldier with my unit,

415
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,643
and here I am, a man of some means

416
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,647
with a most beautiful
woman at my side.

417
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,399
I share your good fortune.

418
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,900
But can you really love me?

419
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,443
Of course I can!

420
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,786
Why do you ask such a silly question?

421
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,867
Because you're a young countess...

422
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,869
and I'm only the son of a soldier.

423
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,371
A very brave soldier.

424
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,540
- A general.
- True.

425
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,294
But I cannot trade on his reputation.

426
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:54,422
I have my own way to make.

427
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,223
And by your standards,
I have much to learn.

428
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,435
Then let me teach you.

429
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,238
What's your business
with those two villains?

430
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,199
I saw them not two hours ago

431
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,785
creeping to the forest
with a heavy... load.

432
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,997
They're friends of Janco,
the gamekeeper.

433
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,041
They take his provisions.

434
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,251
That's what you saw, my friend.

435
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,128
Oh.

436
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,972
Was it? Yes, well, he...
he must have a big appetite.

437
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,138
Oh, no, no, no, no.

438
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,141
It somewhat dulls my senses
at this time of day.

439
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,935
Oh, drink, Fabio.

440
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,187
Drink to the Countess Ilona.

441
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,022
Well, if you insist.

442
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,198
The Countess Ilona.

443
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,905
While we're about it, what's
happened to Countess Elisabeth?

444
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,616
Is she going to stay
in her room forever?

445
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:08,120
She can't be very ill or she'd
have called her physician.

446
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,501
And I can't believe that it's
widowhood that detains her.

447
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,796
What are you worrying about, Fabio?

448
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,805
It's a better place
without her, isn't it?

449
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,951
Oh, I'm so happy!

450
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,203
Then will you marry me?

451
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,999
Yes. Yes, of course I will!

452
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,704
- I will speak to your mother.
- No.

453
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,664
- Huh?
- Leave her to me.

454
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,332
Why? You fear she'll object?

455
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,961
Oh, don't be silly.
She adores you already.

456
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,096
But she's old and
needs to be humored.

457
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,551
Do it quickly.

458
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,269
- Speak to her tomorrow.
- Yes.

459
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,077
Hey, look!

460
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,664
All right. Come on.

461
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,355
In that tree.

462
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,899
- Hey, there's one.
- Where?

463
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,075
No, it's not. Come on.

464
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,322
- Look, there's one!
- Hey!

465
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,699
Come on. I'll get it.

466
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,826
Come on, slow coach.

467
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,919
Ow!

468
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,881
Help! Help!

469
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,335
Help!

470
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,961
Married?

471
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,547
You are insane.

472
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:27,385
Don't you realize that you get
uglier each time you get old?

473
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,595
And you can't go on killing forever.

474
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,972
Why not, with you
and Julie to help me?

475
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,225
And what about Fabio
and the servants?

476
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,851
Oh, you don't fear Fabio.

477
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,728
He's not such a fool.

478
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,570
We're quite safe.

479
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,657
And I am happy.

480
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,495
You don't begrudge me that, do you?

481
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,662
Where are you going?

482
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,622
To meet your fiancé.

483
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,582
We're signing the deeds
of the inheritance,

484
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,252
so I'll have the pleasure
of his company tonight.

485
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:05,089
Tell him that the Countess
Elisabeth approves of the marriage

486
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,391
and has made you responsible
for the arrangements.

487
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,139
To hell with the Countess Elisabeth!

488
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,392
Shh. Don't be so angry.

489
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,986
I haven't forgotten you. I promise.

490
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,150
No.

491
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,734
Not now, Dobi.

492
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,778
- When?
- Soon.

493
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,363
Tonight?

494
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,289
If you wish.

495
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,293
I'll be here.

496
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,296
My God, she's so white.

497
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,173
Any of you seen her before?

498
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,514
- No.
- No.

499
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,552
Are there any gypsies 'round here?

500
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,222
I've seen a few girls
like her with the circus.

501
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,725
In the marketplace last night.

502
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,442
Go on.

503
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,710
All right, all right,
I'm not arresting you.

504
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,512
Not unless you've got a
murderer hidden in there.

505
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,183
Have you seen anyone with a
gypsy girl going into the forest?

506
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,203
No!

507
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,413
Oh, no! Let go of me!

508
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,583
Let go! Help! Help!

509
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,467
Help!

510
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,366
Why do they stare at us?

511
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,905
- Fear.
- Fear? Fear of what?

512
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,700
As a dog fears its master.

513
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,619
But a dog is also keen
to serve its master.

514
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,746
I fear we have no service.

515
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,299
Boy, a flagon of wine. Speed.

516
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,636
Hey, another tankard here.

517
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,976
Well, there you are, Lieutenant.

518
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,769
You are now the undisputed possessor

519
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:09,572
of 34 horses and 59 mares.

520
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,320
So, what will you do with them, eh?

521
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,240
Make a gift of them to my
good friend the captain here?

522
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,075
Or will you stay on in these parts?

523
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,703
I have excellent reasons
for staying on.

524
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,331
The boy believes
himself to be in love.

525
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,083
Ah. May one ask with whom?

526
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,759
It's no secret.

527
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,545
The Countess Ilona.

528
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,631
They are to be married.

529
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,799
Has she returned? I'd no idea.

530
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,427
- My heartiest congratulations.
- Thank you.

531
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,471
- Captain.
- Yes, Sergeant, what is it?

532
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,222
- It's the gypsy girl, sir.
- The what?

533
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,975
From the circus.
We've got her outside.

534
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,270
She's in a horrible state, sir.
Blood's all gone.

535
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,230
What are you talking about?

536
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,566
Drained out of her, sir.
She's as white as chalk.

537
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,076
The villagers,
they're getting frightened.

538
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,490
Ah, Ziza, my little dumpling!

539
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,992
You know the captain?

540
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,620
- I've made his acquaintance.
- Yes.

541
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,914
But one acquaintance you haven't
made is Lieutenant Toth,

542
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,291
the young man who
stands but an inch away

543
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,043
from marriage to a
lady of noble birth.

544
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,087
They'll make a fine pair.

545
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:17,174
But not as fine a pair as these, eh?

546
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:21,102
The lady has a sizzling wit.

547
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,364
Captain!

548
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,783
Yes, Sergeant, what is it?

549
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,661
Oh, very well. Excuse me, gentlemen.

550
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,997
My watchdog calls.

551
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,623
I shall return.

552
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,334
Come on, then, take me to
this bloodless corpse of yours.

553
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,385
Oh, Babus!

554
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,140
She's very good.

555
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,983
Babus, more!

556
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,691
Oh. Do you want her?

557
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,401
Ziza?

558
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,946
No, she's for you, my friend.

559
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,031
Your need is greater.

560
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,033
Not tonight.

561
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,327
No, you have need of her tonight.

562
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,419
But I'm spoken for!

563
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,290
Tell me, Dobi...

564
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,501
I am curious to know.

565
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,004
A man of your position and authority,

566
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,757
why have you never got married, huh?

567
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,300
Don't you believe in it?

568
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,885
It fits some people.

569
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,055
I think you should be married...

570
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,807
to the Countess Elisabeth.

571
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,476
She's free, well-seasoned.

572
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:17,187
We shall have a double wedding!

573
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,480
Will you drink to that?

574
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,691
Why should a man be
a slave to one woman

575
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:21,984
when he can have the pick of any?

576
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,153
Oh, but if that woman
embodies all the virtues?

577
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,866
Mistress, friend, and mother in one?
Does such a woman exist?

578
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,375
You know she does.

579
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,004
And I have found her.

580
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,834
Then you are blessed indeed.

581
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:39,835
Mm.

582
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,545
But also vulnerable.

583
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,838
How so?

584
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,048
Being so dazzled by
the light of your love

585
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,684
that you cannot see a man
steal upon you in the dark.

586
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:53,181
Ah, will you buy some beads, hmm?

587
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,018
Ah, or a Turkish dagger?

588
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,561
To protect you from your enemies.

589
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,564
Why should I have enemies?

590
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,317
All men have enemies.

591
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,904
But blessed men more
since they are envied.

592
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,780
Away, fool!

593
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,240
This is Turkish talk.

594
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,825
Ziza!

595
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,285
Me, Captain?

596
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,495
Our young friend is
much taken with you.

597
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,247
- No, no, no, she's for you, my friend.
- Really?

598
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:21,126
Oh, come on, my friend.
Enjoy her while you can.

599
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:25,262
What's the matter?
Thinking of your lady love?

600
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,314
Julie!

601
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,407
Oh, Dobi!

602
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,911
What's the joke?
Come on, let me in on it.

603
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,579
I've made a little bet with him.

604
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,872
Over me?

605
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,166
- I'll have him any time. He's beautiful.
- Will you?

606
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,592
That he can't get you
into the castle unseen.

607
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,338
The castle?

608
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,632
You win the bet. I'm not going there.

609
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,842
Why not?

610
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:13,345
Haven't you heard what they're
saying about the Countess?

611
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,471
- No.
- She's a witch.

612
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,722
A witch?

613
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,599
All the Báthorys are witches.

614
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:20,018
Sold their souls to the devil.

615
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,521
Their ancestor was a
seven-headed dragon.

616
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,522
No, Ziza!

617
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,448
And the worst of them all
is the Countess Elisabeth.

618
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,779
50 koronas if you come with us.

619
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,572
50?

620
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:35,075
And my protection from the witch.

621
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,452
- Promise?
- Promise.

622
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,829
Oh, well.

623
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,915
I was never one to listen
to gossip. Come on.

624
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,208
- Come on where?
- We're going. Come on.

625
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,252
Where are we going?
Just a minute. My hat.

626
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,593
Come on.

627
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,779
Forgive me.

628
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,466
Shh!

629
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,346
- Dobi!
- Quiet!

630
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,925
- Ziza!
- Oh.

631
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,135
Shh!

632
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,603
Ziza!

633
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,857
Where are we?

634
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:52,569
Oh, yes.

635
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,946
We're going that way, Ziza.

636
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:58,158
I don't go that way, I don't
go that way, I go that way.

637
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,410
Down that way we go.

638
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,661
- Dobi.
- Shh!

639
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:02,996
Shh!

640
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,672
Shush. Shh.

641
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,253
Have fun, my little ones.

642
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,631
Come on, darling.

643
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,302
Oh. The gallant Captain.

644
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,596
I mistook you for a ghost.

645
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,599
And I mistook you for a villain
and damn near cut your throat!

646
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,809
Oh.

647
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,144
What's your business?

648
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:11,189
Uh, well, I... I found
a most intriguing map

649
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:14,776
that marks doors and passages
that I never knew existed.

650
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,529
I've been tracing them. Look.

651
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,121
At this hour?

652
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,909
My mind is most alert at night...

653
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,286
while people sleep.

654
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:28,165
Well, do as you please,
but keep to the library.

655
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,375
Don't go prowling.

656
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,836
You might frighten somebody.

657
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,971
Or end up a ghost myself.

658
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,754
You cheated me.

659
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,793
You knew this would happen,
and you've made a fool of me.

660
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,886
No, I promise.

661
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,383
What do you want?

662
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,177
That we should make love?

663
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,346
Now, as you are?

664
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,306
Like two old fools
fumbling at each other?

665
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,391
Don't be cruel.

666
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,893
Help me.

667
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,646
Why should I help you, huh?

668
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:33,939
You don't want me.

669
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,316
It's him... Imre.

670
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,861
It's him you're thinking about and
how you'll look for him tomorrow.

671
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,613
No...

672
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,573
But you still need me, don't you?

673
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,826
As a whore needs her pander.

674
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:51,164
But there's just one customer who
doesn't want you, young or old...

675
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,750
your little lover.

676
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,878
I'll show you.

677
00:55:56,978 --> 00:56:00,340
- Come and watch him...
- No.

678
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,685
In his satisfaction with
a real young woman.

679
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,806
Now...

680
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,893
lying on my bed...

681
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:15,563
coupling with the
cheapest whore in town!

682
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:18,448
- No, I don't want to see...
- Come!

683
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,617
Come...

684
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,619
see...

685
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,839
your young lover, Imre...

686
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,176
with that!

687
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,593
What's your game, eh?

688
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,096
Pushing me onto a little bastard
who doesn't want me?

689
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,390
What's the matter? Can't he do it?

690
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,434
You ought to give him a few lessons.

691
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,728
- A whole night I've wasted!
- Stay in there!

692
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,647
I want my money!

693
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,608
You arranged it.

694
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,235
No, I didn't.

695
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,653
Be quiet!

696
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,531
You brought that slut in here.

697
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:07,741
Good.

698
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,834
How very thoughtful of you.

699
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,955
Imre doesn't need her.

700
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,707
I do!

701
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,925
Bring her to me... now!

702
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,596
Now!

703
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,890
Where's my money, then? Where is it?

704
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,933
- It's not my fault the bastard's asleep.
- Leave me alone.

705
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,644
I want my 50 koronas!
Did you hear me?

706
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,862
I want my money!

707
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,197
- A hundred?
- For a better client.

708
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,657
You had no fun here.
Well, you should now.

709
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,409
It's not a man. It's a woman.

710
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,287
She may ask some special favors.

711
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:58,382
For a hundred, I'd take
on a whole Turkish harem.

712
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,265
Dobi!

713
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,975
Dobi, look at me!

714
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,477
I did the same as before,
and it didn't work! I don't know.

715
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,063
- Maybe it doesn't work anymore!
- Wait! Wait! The book!

716
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,156
What book?!

717
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,180
Is this what you're looking for?

718
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,803
If you kill me, your mistress
will never know the truth!

719
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,687
Leave him!

720
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,393
Don't trust him.

721
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,904
Trust me, and I'll help you.
Choose, Countess.

722
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,366
Let him speak.

723
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,573
The chapter on blood sacrifices.

724
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,950
- Yes, yes, I've read it.
- But not far enough, Captain...

725
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,244
or you wouldn't have made
such a simple mistake.

726
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,955
It states quite clearly,

727
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,124
"For the restoration
of youth and beauty,

728
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:06,920
only the blood of a
virgin may be used."

729
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,838
She was a common whore.

730
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,889
- Oh, well.
- You fool!

731
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,386
Thank you, Master Fabio,
for your scholarship on the matter.

732
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,431
You shall not go unrewarded.

733
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,434
Countess, if I can
assist at any time...

734
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:24,854
You know, I find the whole
subject most enthralling!

735
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,321
Thank you.

736
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:31,827
Dobi, tomorrow you will
make good your mistake.

737
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,083
A virgin, remember.

738
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,375
You're mad to trust him.

739
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,543
Why?

740
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,795
Let him live in fear for his life.

741
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,596
That way he will never betray us.

742
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,868
Watch the Strong Woman bend iron!

743
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,628
Sir! Sir! Sir!

744
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,797
Sir, look at this one, sir.

745
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,133
Feel the muscles of these arms.

746
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,552
And, sir, these thighs.

747
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,721
Why, they could pull the
weight of any carriage.

748
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,724
And these breasts are
breasts of solid teak.

749
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,977
Why, she can work longer
hours than anyone I know.

750
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:49,147
A bargain, sir,
for a hundred koronas,

751
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:54,993
and what is more, sir, I tell you,
she's willing, as well.

752
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,455
No.

753
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,952
- How much for this one?
- What?

754
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,288
- This one here.
- Young Bertha?

755
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:11,252
Oh, you can have her for free if
you take a goat for 25 koronas.

756
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,046
She ever been with a man?

757
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,798
Are you joking?

758
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:19,636
Can you imagine anybody wanting to?

759
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,803
I'll take her.

760
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,388
Oh, come on, girl.

761
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,265
Come on, up you go. Up you go.

762
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,976
All right, go on, go on, go on.
Off with him.

763
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,729
And now we have two more!

764
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:33,073
Two more beauties!

765
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:21,823
Countess.

766
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:25,083
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I was looking for your daughter.

767
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,038
She went out early to
gather some flowers.

768
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,298
- Thank you.
- Oh, please stay.

769
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,962
We have much to talk about, I think.

770
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,887
Yes, indeed.

771
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,932
I, um... I wanted to
speak to you before,

772
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,351
but Ilona told me of your illness.

773
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,729
I'm very happy to see you better.

774
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,356
I'm better today, but I am not well.

775
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:57,775
The shock of the past
few days, you understand.

776
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,402
Of course.

777
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,486
Ilona will have told you...

778
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:03,698
That you are in love and
wish to be married.

779
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,700
I sincerely hope that you approve.

780
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,786
It was always my late husband's wish

781
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:11,873
that you, the son of
his dearest friend,

782
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,840
should one day meet our daughter.

783
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:17,962
Alas, he did not live to see it.

784
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,931
However, you made
his widow very happy.

785
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,219
I promise you, Countess,

786
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:29,439
I shall honor and cherish Ilona
for the rest of my days.

787
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,150
Come to me.

788
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,413
My son.

789
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,046
Oh!

790
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,077
Psst! Psst!

791
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,704
- Fabio, what's the matter?
- Shh!

792
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,455
I had to speak to you urgently.

793
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,416
Have you seen the
Countess Ilona today?

794
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,585
No. I was just going to look for her.

795
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,670
Don't be disappointed
if you can't find her.

796
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,255
What?!

797
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,299
- I can't talk now.
- Fabio!

798
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:29,225
- Meet me tonight after supper.
- What...

799
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,025
Fabio?

800
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,448
Fabio!

801
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,575
Poor man.

802
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,326
Brilliant scholar.

803
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,711
Seeker of wisdom.

804
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:06,876
He read all those books,
knew everything,

805
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,553
but now... he knows nothing.

806
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:19,020
You killed him.

807
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,391
You killed him because
he knew something

808
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,351
about you and the Countess.

809
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,479
He was going to tell me,
but you stopped him!

810
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,814
Now, listen to me, you young whelp!

811
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:31,358
You came here, you took the stables.
All right, keep them.

812
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,526
But the Countess is mine,
do you understand?

813
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:33,944
I've waited for 20 years!

814
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:36,871
Take her then! I don't want her!

815
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,742
- It's Ilona I love.
- Ilona?

816
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,202
Yes.

817
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,578
Where is she?

818
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,121
You want to see her, huh?

819
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:47,500
- You want to see your bride?
- Yes!

820
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:52,254
So you shall, in all her glory.

821
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,806
Come with me!

822
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,700
Julie? That you?

823
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,788
Julie! Answer me.

824
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,756
Oh, my God.

825
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:33,594
Come, Julie.

826
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,801
Ilona...

827
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,393
where is your mother?

828
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,014
The Countess Elisabeth, where is she?

829
01:10:44,114 --> 01:10:46,858
Imre...

830
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,437
- Won't find her.
- Blood.

831
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:51,522
Where is she?

832
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:52,982
- Forget her.
- Huh?

833
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,116
- Forget her.
- Where?

834
01:10:57,878 --> 01:10:59,071
You've killed her.

835
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:03,492
No.

836
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:06,043
I am Elisabeth.

837
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,581
Look at me.

838
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,791
My face.

839
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:13,002
My body.

840
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,795
Hold me.

841
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:16,922
No.

842
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,674
Blood.

843
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:19,800
Whose blood?

844
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,218
No matter.

845
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:24,138
I did it for you, my darling.

846
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,891
To please you.

847
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,649
I am Ilona.

848
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,903
Don't touch me.

849
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,650
You tried to be unfaithful
to me last night,

850
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,535
and you couldn't even do that!

851
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,239
You're obsessed with me.

852
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:45,583
- Last night?
- You brought that whore in here.

853
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:48,370
You think I didn't know?

854
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,748
You think Dobi didn't tell me?

855
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,716
- He's lying!
- Oh, is he?

856
01:11:58,355 --> 01:11:59,555
There.

857
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:05,596
What have you done to her?

858
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:06,805
Me?

859
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:09,315
I have done nothing.

860
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,195
You killed her.

861
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:23,948
And there are witnesses.

862
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:27,083
- Dobi?
- As many as I choose.

863
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,505
My darling...

864
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,716
you can't escape now.

865
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,639
My son.

866
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,415
Has the Countess been told?

867
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,250
She took it badly.

868
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,802
Master Fabio was much
loved by us all.

869
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:30,938
Why did he do it?

870
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,019
The Count's death.

871
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,029
- They were very old friends.
- Yeah.

872
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,485
But, of course...

873
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,071
there is another possibility.

874
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:47,698
Fortune card.

875
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:49,992
You mean the gypsy girl?

876
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,869
I found them in the
drawer of his desk.

877
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,662
So you think he killed her

878
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:57,291
and then hanged himself
from remorse or guilt.

879
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:59,008
I see.

880
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,713
What were his habits with women?
Did he ever confide in you?

881
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,340
No. None of my business.

882
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,216
But I never saw him at the
Shepherd's Inn. Did you?

883
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:09,310
No. Maybe better if we had.
At least it's healthy.

884
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:12,139
Of course, he could have
stumbled upon the real killer

885
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,690
who then silenced him.

886
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:18,896
Too fanciful. Yeah.

887
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,689
Well, anyway, my men are
searching the castle now,

888
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,074
so we... we should learn something.

889
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,953
Where do you think you're going?!

890
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:37,289
I'm not staying here.

891
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,416
There's a curse on this place!

892
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:42,718
You come back! And your brat!

893
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:47,515
Nobody leaves without
my permission! Understood?

894
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:51,887
Where is she? Have you found her?
Have you found my little one?

895
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:53,472
Stop worrying.

896
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,266
There's nothing to connect your
daughter and the gypsy girl.

897
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,060
Sergeant! Sergeant! Here!

898
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,111
What? Where?

899
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:05,609
- Sergeant! Here!
- What is it? What?

900
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,027
What is it, man?

901
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,696
Found someone?

902
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:11,789
What's going on?

903
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,497
No!

904
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:22,174
No! Teri!

905
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,223
One of them was poor Ziza.

906
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:39,309
- So I've been told.
- Mm.

907
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:40,853
Well, are they all present?

908
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:42,695
Take your choice.

909
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:01,373
Well, you must have problems if you
need these villains for servants.

910
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,584
Well, we can't pick and choose.
The war took the best.

911
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:06,510
Sergeant, take these men to the
county house for questioning.

912
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,799
And these two.

913
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,092
No!

914
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:14,560
No!

915
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,271
The rest can stay.

916
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:21,894
Now, I want all the women...
young and old...

917
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,903
to leave the castle within the hour.

918
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,690
All right, all right!
Don't panic, I say!

919
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:29,610
You will be allowed to return as
soon as the matter is settled.

920
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,069
Now, come on. Move yourselves.

921
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,989
Come along. Will you please move?

922
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,867
Go on. Start packing. Hurry along.

923
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,335
Excuse me, Captain Balogh.

924
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,999
You mean to include my mother and me?

925
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,459
Oh, no, no, no, Countess.
Please forgive me.

926
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,337
I-I'm sure you'll be perfectly safe
with Captain Dobi and your fiancé,

927
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,756
but they couldn't be
responsible for everyone,

928
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:54,134
and it is just possible the killer
may still be in hiding somewhere.

929
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:56,435
Stay close to her.

930
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,309
I don't know where we're going.

931
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,186
Why did...

932
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,446
Why did they pick me?
I've been here so long.

933
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,170
Check.

934
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:29,343
You're in check.

935
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:38,136
Oh, come on, what are
you so gloomy about?

936
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:39,930
Don't you see what'll happen?

937
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:43,767
She'll grow old, starved of
her little virgin girls,

938
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:46,061
and she'll be mine.

939
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,736
And you can clear out.

940
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,190
That's what you want, isn't it?

941
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:51,817
The Countess wants to see you.

942
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,868
- Which one of us?
- You, Captain.

943
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,841
You knew about it from the beginning.

944
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,421
How could you say nothing?

945
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,590
I wanted to see her happy.

946
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,800
I brought her little
one into the world.

947
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,309
Ilona?

948
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:20,345
The real Ilona?

949
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:21,597
Oh-ho!

950
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,182
She was so beautiful.

951
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:28,110
I used to tell her stories,
sing her to sleep.

952
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,856
But they had to send her away.

953
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:33,400
Why didn't she come back?

954
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,068
They said she was on the way.

955
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:37,738
It was the flood that stopped her.

956
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,448
Listen, Julie!

957
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,741
You know as well as I

958
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:43,493
Captain Balogh won't
find the murderer.

959
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:45,419
That means we're imprisoned here!

960
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,081
Trapped forever.

961
01:18:48,181 --> 01:18:50,417
But I'm not imprisoned.

962
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:52,468
This is my home.

963
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:04,939
- Oh, please.
- What do you want of me?

964
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,268
I shan't go to sleep tonight,

965
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:11,897
thinking that it might
happen again anytime.

966
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:14,858
Couldn't we have someone
ready at the castle?

967
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:19,863
How can I get anyone in with
the bailiffs at the gate?

968
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:21,907
Oh, but you can outwit them.

969
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,542
You can do anything. Anything.

970
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,878
Very well.

971
01:19:34,278 --> 01:19:36,278
Very well.

972
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,634
Dobi...

973
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:43,894
you will bring someone here tonight?

974
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:51,944
She'll be ready when you need her.

975
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,470
Good night, Countess.

976
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:28,105
- Julie.
- My dear?

977
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,644
Julie, Captain Dobi
promised to bring me

978
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:34,688
a girl from the village,

979
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:37,607
but I fear he may have tricked me.

980
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:40,068
He's jealous of my beauty.

981
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:41,611
And my love for Imre.

982
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:43,488
What do you want me to do?

983
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:48,285
Search the castle, every room,
and if you find her, don't disturb her.

984
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:51,538
Just to put my mind at rest.

985
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:53,589
Go now! Hurry!

986
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,620
Looking for someone?

987
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,996
The Countess is anxious.

988
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:34,539
She's here.

989
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,840
The girl's ready.

990
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:43,597
Good night, Julie.

991
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:40,821
Nanny?

992
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,491
Is it you, Nanny?

993
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,662
Oh...

994
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:51,623
My little one.

995
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:56,162
You remember me?

996
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:57,914
Oh, yes.

997
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:01,216
I remember you.

998
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:04,629
My child.

999
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:06,847
My baby!

1000
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:11,636
Nanny, please help me.

1001
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:13,805
I don't know what's happened to me.

1002
01:23:13,905 --> 01:23:15,432
My father is dead.

1003
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:17,017
- Shh...
- I haven't seen my mother.

1004
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:20,402
You must be patient, my little one.

1005
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:29,070
They say it's an ill omen

1006
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:32,789
that we should see each other on
the morning of our wedding day.

1007
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:36,453
But I'm not superstitious.

1008
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,587
Are you, my darling?

1009
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,926
Oh, I'm so happy!

1010
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:56,181
Dobi, I've decided to overrule Captain
Balogh's orders just for today.

1011
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:59,059
I want everyone to share my happiness

1012
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,693
and attend the ceremony.

1013
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:04,940
All the women servants
and the tradespeople

1014
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,650
and even our friendly bailiffs.

1015
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,777
And drinks for everyone.

1016
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,654
Will you make the
arrangements, please?

1017
01:24:10,754 --> 01:24:13,288
And your...

1018
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,992
mother...

1019
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:18,203
will she be attending?

1020
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:21,790
Sadly, no.
She's really quite ill today.

1021
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,548
I am most concerned.

1022
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,842
Julie, will you,
when you're finished,

1023
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:36,311
help me with my
wedding dress, please?

1024
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,772
Master Imre.

1025
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:47,899
Master Imre?

1026
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:50,402
Will you please come with me?

1027
01:24:50,502 --> 01:24:52,779
There's someone you have to meet.

1028
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:54,656
Please.

1029
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,581
Hurry.

1030
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:08,336
Don't be afraid, my love.

1031
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,880
This is Imre Toth. He's visiting us.

1032
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:15,142
Master Imre, Master Imre,
this is Countess Ilona.

1033
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,644
Ah.

1034
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,932
Your name is familiar to me.

1035
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:22,726
My father was General Toth.

1036
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:25,603
Of course. My father
spoke of him in letters.

1037
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:26,938
He also spoke of you.

1038
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:29,899
Yes, I believe it was his wish
that we should one day meet.

1039
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:32,277
- Julie?
- Oh, Master Imre, we must go.

1040
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,696
- Who is it?
- Come. Quickly.

1041
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,788
We'll come back.

1042
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:46,923
Dobi brought her for the Countess.
She must escape.

1043
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,052
Wait.

1044
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:55,592
You must lead her away
during the ceremony.

1045
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:58,553
No one will notice your absence.
Take her to the stables.

1046
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,346
- You'll meet us there?
- I cannot.

1047
01:26:00,446 --> 01:26:03,016
- But, Master Imre...
- You know I cannot.

1048
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,142
God knows I wish it,

1049
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:07,353
but I have witnessed so much blood,
my very being reeks of it.

1050
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:09,773
But you are innocent as she is.

1051
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,191
You must go together.

1052
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:14,194
- Together?
- Julie, I'm waiting.

1053
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,614
- Take her.
- And raise false hopes to break them?

1054
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:20,867
No. It's unthinkable.
You must save her.

1055
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:24,086
Go now, quickly,
before we are discovered.

1056
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:36,883
Oh, please tell me what's happening.

1057
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:39,594
Foolish Nanny says I should
be patient, but how can I be?

1058
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,262
- She tells me nothing.
- Countess, you don't know.

1059
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,389
She's so stubborn.
She makes me quite angry.

1060
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:45,600
Your life is in grave danger.

1061
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,143
From whom?

1062
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:49,270
I cannot tell you,
but please trust me.

1063
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:52,190
You must leave at once.

1064
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,199
Leave my home?

1065
01:26:56,252 --> 01:26:59,114
But I want to see my father's grave.

1066
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,699
And my mother, I must speak with her.

1067
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:03,743
I'm afraid that is not possible.

1068
01:27:03,843 --> 01:27:05,537
Why?

1069
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,504
Tell me.

1070
01:27:11,851 --> 01:27:14,003
Please, I beg you,
do not argue with me.

1071
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:17,757
In a short while, Julie will
take you to the stable.

1072
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:20,009
Now, do not speak to anyone.

1073
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,303
But I will say I am
the Countess Ilona.

1074
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:24,180
You will not be believed.

1075
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,850
Take a horse and ride with
haste to the county house.

1076
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,393
Wait there for Captain Balogh.

1077
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:32,147
When he comes,
tell him of your misfortunes.

1078
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,947
Will you not come with me?

1079
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,527
I fear to go alone.

1080
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:38,945
You must not fear.

1081
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,621
Please come with me.

1082
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,334
I'll meet you at the stables.

1083
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:48,329
You will not fail me?

1084
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,130
No.

1085
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:55,594
I must go now.

1086
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,890
Do everything that Julie tells you.

1087
01:29:44,003 --> 01:29:46,288
Shh.

1088
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:58,251
Come, child.

1089
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,544
No.

1090
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,421
Listen, Nanny. I can hear a priest.

1091
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,047
What's happening?

1092
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:05,174
It's no concern of yours, my love.

1093
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:06,384
We must hurry.

1094
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,094
No, leave me.

1095
01:30:08,194 --> 01:30:10,763
I want to know. I must know.

1096
01:30:10,863 --> 01:30:12,063
No.

1097
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:41,843
- Amen.
- Amen.

1098
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:03,691
Where is she?

1099
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:06,826
Where is she?

1100
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:12,533
- Where is she?!
- Mother?

1101
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:15,877
- Don't touch her!
- Mother?

1102
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:55,368
- The hangman...
- It's the hangman.

1103
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,578
- He's come for the Countess.
- The woman.

1104
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:59,372
- The hangman.
- The devil woman.

1105
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:01,791
- Devil woman.
- They'll kill her.

1106
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:04,001
They'll kill her.

1107
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:05,545
Devil woman.

1108
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:08,005
- The devil woman.
- The devil woman.

1109
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:10,675
Devil woman.

1110
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,768
Countess Dracula.

1111
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:18,898
The devil woman.

1112
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:23,328
Countess Dracula.

1113
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:28,116
- Devil woman.
- Countess.
