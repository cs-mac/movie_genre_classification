1
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
How many?

2
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,800
Six or seven, maybe eight.

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Can't you count?

4
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,480
They're not exactly all together, sir.

5
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
Well, where are they?

6
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,000
They're here, it's just,

7
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
well, not everything is attached, sir.

8
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,120
We're short a few parts.

9
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
Parts?

10
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,400
This way, sir.

11
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,000
Think I got
a shoe over here in the bush.

12
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, Jesus Christ!

13
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,320
Put a lid on this as of now.

14
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,920
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
We'll cordon off the area, sir.

16
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,080
Let me talk to the survivors.

17
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,480
There's only one left.

18
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
Only one?

19
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,480
My god, it's happening all over again!

20
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
He claims to be the writer,

21
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,800
and he's still somewhat in shock.

22
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
Mt. Lyman?

23
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,280
This is chief deyner.

24
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,800
What's going on here?

25
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
I don't know.

26
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,280
We were just making a movie.

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,480
A movie?

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,320
There are seven...

29
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,200
or eight.

30
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
Or eight corpses layin' out there.

31
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,000
What the hell kind of movie was it?

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know, I usedta know, but.

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,280
Did anyone know they were here?

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,200
I want every available man here, now!

35
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,520
Josh, I'm sorry,

36
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,800
i-i couldn't see through the makeup.

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
I thought it was Oliver.

38
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
Yeah, well, Oliver's over here,

39
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,600
where he's supposed to be.

40
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,920
Who the hell is that?

41
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,120
Uh,

42
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,480
Steven Blake, I was
told to come to the set.

43
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,600
To the set, not on it.

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,080
Blake's the real cop I told you about.

45
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,920
He investigated the real murders here.

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,120
Ah, ok.

47
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Uh, Mr. Blake, I believe you're gonna be

48
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,280
one of our technical advisers,

49
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,800
and technical advisers
belong behind the camera.

50
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,720
Freddie, let's go!

51
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Quiet, let's do it again!

52
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Oliver, your agent's on the phone.

53
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,800
Oh, Josh, Freddie.

54
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,280
Take 10, everybody, 10.

55
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
Josh, uh, I've got another scene.

56
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,880
No, Arthur, no.

57
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,600
Look, it has pace.

58
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,480
It's not the movie I'm making.

59
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,880
Ok, but I like this movie.

60
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,000
Peter?

61
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Oh, Harry.

62
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Your interview with that movie magazine.

63
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,000
Mm, terrific.

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,200
They're on hold.

65
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Listen, have you found
me any local bimbos yet?

66
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,200
Not yet.

67
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, stay on it, who is this?

68
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,280
Her name is Sally Evans.

69
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Hello, Sally, Harry sleerik.

70
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,600
Harry sleerik, I'm the producer.

71
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,600
No, this film is nothing
like babysitter basher.

72
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,280
Yeah, it was a good little movie.

73
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,800
Uh-huh, oh, absolutely,
this film will be done

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,520
in good taste.

75
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,400
That's cold!

76
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,720
Don't touch it, don't
touch it, just let it dry.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
Josh, we're ready.

78
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,320
Tell me those aren't great.

79
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,000
Robbie, there will be
no exploding tit shot!

80
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,800
Look, Harry specifically...

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,200
oh, I can imagine what Harry said.

82
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,120
Are those yours.

83
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
No, he made 'em for me.

84
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,880
Too bad.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,120
Ok, look, at least let
me tear the nipple off.

86
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
Jesus, think of the audience.

87
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,600
Do you think my mother could watch that?

88
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
I don't know, what's she like?

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,280
I want subtle.

90
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,600
This,

91
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
this is not subtle!

92
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,200
Don't do that!

93
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,400
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

94
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,880
How long's it take?

95
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,480
Oh, 'bout as long as it takes

96
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,920
to digest the caterer's donuts.

97
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,000
Watch it, hey here, hold this, huh?

98
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,200
Yes, terrible
murders and mutilations.

99
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,080
When'd you find this guy?

100
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,400
About five minutes ago,
look, Josh, I may be wrong...

101
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
I like that, where is he?

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,120
Freddie said you canceled the motel rooms.

103
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,400
Uh, excuse me a minute,
production emergency.

104
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,000
Too expensive, everyone stays right here.

105
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,000
There's plenty of room.

106
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,080
So we're gonna be
working and living here.

107
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,720
That's just like camp!

108
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,200
You're gonna turn this
into an asylum, Harry.

109
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Josh, it's nostalgia, didn't you ever

110
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,920
wanna go back to high school,
see what it'd be like?

111
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,680
No, no, not really.

112
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,480
Hey, Josh, I got the lead in the series!

113
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,200
Hey, that's great, what is it?

114
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,080
Oh, it's an action
adventure with some humor.

115
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Kind of a ripoff of Miami
vice and moonlighting.

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,400
Great, when does it start?

117
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,600
Tomorrow.

118
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,400
Tomorrow, hey, Oliver, you got,

119
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,120
you got four more weeks here!

120
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,480
Josh, this is a series.

121
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
Hey, Oliver, this is a movie!

122
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,920
Yeah, a low budget movie.

123
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
Now, you can't do this to me!

124
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
We got a contract.

125
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,800
We can sue.

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,600
No, ya can't, that takes money.

127
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Josh.

128
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,800
No, Arthur, no.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
The high school's been
closed down ever since.

130
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
Now, listen, Sally, i
think you should know

131
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,520
just one more fact for the article.

132
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,000
The murderer was never
caught nor even identified.

133
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Sally, I really gotta go, I'll
look forward to reading it.

134
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,800
And, by the way, it was really
nice talking to you, Sally.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,600
Sure, you, too, have a nice day.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,280
Peter, Peter!

137
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,200
Peter!

138
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Yeah, Harry?

139
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,080
Don't you hear me, what, do I stutter?

140
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,600
Listen, I wanna guarantee
a good interview.

141
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,000
Prime the pump a little.

142
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,400
Have Sally Evans a little thank you, ok.

143
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Yeah, check her out.

144
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,200
If she's a looker, send
the douchebag some flowers.

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,520
If she's fat, just dump some candy on her.

146
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,720
- Ok.
- Yeah.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Peter!

148
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,200
Yeah, Harry?

149
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,680
Corned beef on rye, lean!

150
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Got it.

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Peter!

152
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,600
Not from the truck!

153
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Not from the truck.

154
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,600
Keep in touch, Harold.

155
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,400
I hope they cancel your series, Oliver.

156
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Scumface!

157
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Actors.

158
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Be cool, Callie.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Gonna be a star, Oliver?

160
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,280
Gonna try.

161
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,600
Yeah, right.

162
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,200
Arthur, I want
you to write a great,

163
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,800
sexy scene for Janine here.

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're gonna have a big
career ahead of you, honey.

165
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,800
You got great tits, they're
fake, but who has to know.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You like me?

167
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,480
All right, that's it,
hold it right there!

168
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,320
What the hell is that?

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hello?

170
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,600
Is anybody here?

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,120
Hey, wait up!

172
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,880
Hey, listen, could you tell me

173
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,800
how to get out of here?

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,800
I thought this was the
way to the parking lot.

175
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,400
What's goin' on?

176
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Jesus.

177
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,920
You see, Oliver's gone
off to better things.

178
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,400
It's a real crusher, but,

179
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,480
we've lost him in this picture.

180
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,320
I mean, you won't catch
me holding him back.

181
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,800
I mean, he's got a career out there, and,

182
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,520
and I'm happy for him.

183
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,280
But he was playing you,

184
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,800
so this is really a
stroke of good fortune,

185
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,400
and I believe in signs.

186
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,280
Yeah, but I've never done this before.

187
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey, you'll be more natural that way!

188
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,880
You remember Mr. kastleman, the principal,

189
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
and Amos, the custodian?

190
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,200
Well, they're gonna be
playing themselves, also!

191
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,800
Are you sure this is a good idea?

192
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,480
Pff, it was the director's idea,

193
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,200
part of his documentary
background, loves realism.

194
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,800
Hey, George!

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,200
Great having you on the
crew, doin' a helluva job.

196
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,600
Couldn't do it without ya!

197
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
Guy's such a moron, so slow.

198
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,520
Brain damage, you know,

199
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,600
but you're gonna be terrific, I feel it!

200
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I can't...

201
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,200
no, you're gonna be great!

202
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, if you think I can handle it.

203
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Pff, trust me.

204
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,280
Harry, Harry, Oliver's leaving.

205
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,000
Ah, don't worry about that scumbag.

206
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,000
Couldn't act for shit
anyway, I gotcha a new star.

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You're not gonna believe it, tailor-made!

208
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,800
Harry, you ok?

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Yeah, trust me.

210
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,800
I mean, who
are we talkin' for this?

211
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,000
Ah, over here.

212
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,400
Steven, this is our
director, Josh Forbes, huh?

213
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,800
Uh, we've met.

214
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,920
Harry, do you got a minute?

215
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,280
He's a cop!

216
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,080
Just what you need!

217
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
I need an actor, Harry!

218
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,000
This is better, this is reality!

219
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Think of the publicity.

220
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,280
Think of the bad scenes.

221
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,480
Bad scenes, good scenes,

222
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,000
publicity gets 'em into the theater!

223
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,080
But they're gonna hate the movie!

224
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
Not if you give 'em more tits and blood.

225
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,400
The film's about people, Harry,

226
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
people, not body parts!

227
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
That's right, people like
Steven Blake, he'll be great!

228
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,920
Josh, Dillon needs you to
check out the lens selection.

229
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Trust me!

230
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,320
Josh?

231
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,000
I just got my contracts, Harry,

232
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,400
and your oily signature was not on it.

233
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
Oh, don't worry about that!

234
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,600
Your, your agent and I have been friends

235
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,200
for over 10 years.

236
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,200
What does that say about my agent?

237
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,200
Oh, Steven Blake, I want you to meet

238
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,880
miss Callie Cassidy, your leading lady.

239
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
You two should get acquainted.

240
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,000
Tomorrow, you're gonna have to

241
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
ball her brains out in technicolor.

242
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,600
Ciao.

243
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,200
Ever the poet.

244
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,880
I'm, uh, I'm not really an actor.

245
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
Oh, well, I'm not
really an actress either.

246
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,000
I've got three films to prove it.

247
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,600
That was a joke.

248
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
Oh, I'm sorry, I, uh.

249
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Yeah.

250
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,000
So, what was it?

251
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,400
The place just felt weird!

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,400
We knew no one ever found the killer,

253
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,080
and we did a lot of night shooting.

254
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,200
There aren't a lot of
lights in that school.

255
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,200
You just felt there was

256
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,120
something out there

257
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,000
in all that darkness.

258
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,280
Yeah, you're right about that.

259
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,120
Then there was that squeaking sound.

260
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,600
It just kept coming.

261
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,880
Closer

262
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
and closer

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,680
and closer.

264
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,920
Oh my god!

265
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
That sheet is moving!

266
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,400
Where?

267
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Over there!

268
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
My god, one of them's still alive!

269
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,680
Check for a pulse.

270
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,800
I thought that was a girl's body!

271
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,680
Uh, it is, sir.

272
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,600
But that's a man's arm!

273
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I know, uh, I, some of the bodies

274
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,200
were pretty torn up, sir, uh,

275
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,000
I guess we got some of the parts mixed up.

276
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,400
Heh, the arm just rolled off.

277
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,400
What are we

278
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
up against?

279
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,880
Who could've done all this?

280
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
What kind of a wh-weapon did they use?

281
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,200
No, no, it-it's been done before.

282
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I need something else, something new!

283
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,400
Ok, but we've got other problems.

284
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,680
Robbie wants to know if you can give him

285
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,120
more time on the severed head.

286
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,000
Wh-what's wrong?

287
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,520
The eyeballs don't
work, he needs to get 'em

288
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,400
to bulge out a little more, take a look.

289
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,920
Hey-hey-hey, how you doin', Amos?

290
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,080
I'm gon' be a movie star!

291
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,000
Should be fun.

292
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,680
Man said just act natural, be cool!

293
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,400
You always were a cool cat.

294
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
Oh, I remembers you, too, Stevie Blake

295
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,000
when you went here, you
was always nice to me.

296
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Not like them others, though.

297
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,000
So what're you gonna do
with your newfound fame?

298
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,120
I'm gonna do some of them pussy films!

299
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,920
Pornos?

300
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,200
Yeah, yes I was!

301
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Why?

302
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,080
Got 10 inches strapped
to the leg right here,

303
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,880
just raring to go g

304
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,400
been moppin' floors too
long, too long, Stevie!

305
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,200
Too long!

306
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,800
Too long, Stevie!

307
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,600
Excuse me?

308
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,600
Mr. kastleman?

309
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Yes.

310
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,600
I don't mean to disturb you,

311
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
but I understand that you
were the principal here

312
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,880
when this whole thing happened.

313
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,600
Yes, yes.

314
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,480
Well, you see, I'm
trying to get a handle

315
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,800
on my character, you know,
what she was like and, uh,

316
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,400
what was she like?

317
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Oh, she,

318
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,920
she was, she was a good student.

319
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,320
She, until that farley boy...

320
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,200
look, I'm sorry if this
whole thing bothers you,

321
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,200
remembering and all.

322
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,120
Well, that's all about
all I do now is remembering.

323
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,200
I just remember all the time.

324
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,520
I can imagine.

325
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
You can?

326
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,320
I wonder if you really can imagine.

327
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,000
You, you see that table
over there in the corner, hmm?

328
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Ordinary corner, isn't it?

329
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,080
Till, till I saw

330
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,800
a nose nailed to the
floor right over there.

331
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,320
And a t-t-tongue

332
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,200
lying right there.

333
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
Eyeballs, eyeballs

334
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,200
dangling from strings,

335
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,800
staring at me right there, and

336
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
that closet, would you like,

337
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,480
would you like to use your imagination and

338
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,320
see if, see if you can
use your imagination.

339
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,080
Just, just open up the door there.

340
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,000
Look right in there, don't be afraid,

341
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,800
just, just use your imagination.

342
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
{y:i}' God!

343
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't touch
it, don't touch anything!

344
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,680
" You jerk!

345
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,880
" Me?

346
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,280
That was rigged for the
skin to rot away on cue

347
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,320
when the doors were opened.

348
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,080
It's over 30 feet of wiring in here

349
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,200
to 15 different circuits and,

350
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,000
four vials of my special homemade pus.

351
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,120
Robbie, that is disgusting!

352
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,800
I'm not talking about
baking cookies here,

353
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,200
madam girl scout, it takes over an hour

354
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,200
to stir this stuff to
the right consistency.

355
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,520
You should spend as much time on your face

356
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,800
as I spent on this one!

357
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,200
You know, if she's not gonna
appreciate what I'm doing,

358
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,600
she shouldn't be here.

359
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,000
Do you have any idea how long it takes

360
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,400
to get this stuff to work just right?

361
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,880
Not as long as it took that murderer

362
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,400
to chop up that poor student.

363
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
I remember them, every one of them.

364
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,720
Sheri!

365
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
Tag team, two out of
three falls, right, sheri?

366
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, got any underwear on today, sheri?

367
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,320
Back off, asshole!

368
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,000
Hey, c'mon, man, chill out, all right'?

369
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,600
I didn't know you two got married.

370
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,920
Thanks, farley.

371
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,120
{y:i}' My hero!

372
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Uh, later, ok?

373
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
Ok.

374
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,080
Oh, pain, doctor!

375
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,720
Yo, please don't tell me you're goin' out

376
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
with the team mascot, come on, fars?

377
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,200
Hey-hey, pussy on wheels pal,

378
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,200
I call, she comes, but,
uh, not for you, cutie.

379
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,200
It's your ticket, man.

380
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
If you can handle the traffic.

381
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,080
Now that, over there, is more my speed.

382
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,720
That's what I call mount Olympus, man,

383
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,400
and as far as I know,
nobody's reached the top yet.

384
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,800
No problem.

385
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,480
You don't stand a chance, Casanova.

386
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,600
Whoa, I feel a little
wager comin' on there, pal.

387
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,680
Oh, a wager, what do you think, Jimmy,

388
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,400
5o bucks, something like that?

389
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,200
Yeah, I'd say 50.

390
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,600
You got it, 50.

391
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,480
I'll even throw in the
wet panties as proof.

392
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,800
Hey, beautiful, I'm talkin' to you!

393
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,600
Wait a second, all right?

394
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Did you want me?

395
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm Richard farley, quarterback.

396
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,600
Oh, really!

397
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
What's your name?

398
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,920
Sarah,

399
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,120
Sarah Walker.

400
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,400
Well, Sarah, seems like
today's your lucky day.

401
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,200
I want you to come and watch me.

402
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,600
Here's a special pass to the game.

403
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,200
Oh, well, thank you very much.

404
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,720
I appreciate the thought,

405
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,320
but I really do have other plans, Richard.

406
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,000
Uh, just hold on there!

407
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,800
What are you doing in here?

408
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,880
I don't know what kind
of a guy you think I am,

409
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,200
but, uh, I just don't give
these passes to every girl

410
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,400
that walks in off the streets.

411
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
I really have no idea
what kind of guy you are.

412
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,800
All I want is your phone number!

413
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
Nsst, now I know.

414
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,720
She's walkin' away!

415
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,720
Get him outta here!

416
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,400
Can't I just call ya?

417
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,080
I'm late and you're in my way!

418
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,400
Tomorrow night, say, uh, seven o'clock.

419
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,800
{y:i}L'll pick ya up-

420
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,920
{y:i}' no!

421
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,680
All right.

422
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,200
Wow, what are you doing, let me down!

423
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,120
Either you say yes
or I'm gonna take Becky

424
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,480
out in the hallway naked.

425
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,920
{y:i}' Sarah!

426
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,320
All right.

427
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,200
Nice view, huh?

428
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,280
Very nice.

429
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,600
It gets better.

430
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,400
This place has good vibes!

431
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Ah, good air.

432
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,480
So, uh, whatta you think?

433
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,080
About what?

434
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,400
About me.

435
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,000
I haven't really given it much thought.

436
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,600
Well {y:i}, that's all right.

437
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
We have all night long.

438
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I think that I should
be getting home now.

439
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,800
You know, uh,

440
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,400
I lost it up here.

441
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,000
Really, well,

442
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,600
thank you for sharing that moment with me.

443
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,320
May we go now?

444
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,600
We just got here!

445
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,680
It's late.

446
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,600
Will you lighten up a little?

447
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,000
Did anyone ever tell you
what a bitchin' bod ya have?

448
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,000
It's time for me to go now, Richard,

449
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
or is it dick?

450
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,400
I am serious!

451
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,520
Listen, I just spent
17.50 plus tip on dinner.

452
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,120
You didn't buy me!

453
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,800
A guy's gotta get somethin'.

454
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,600
Well, that is all
you're getting from me,

455
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,520
now, I am going home
even if I have to walk.

456
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,680
Oh, so you want me to work for it?

457
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,000
What are you doing?

458
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,800
Now, listen, I've been watching you

459
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,120
pushin' through those
clothes all night long.

460
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,520
You can't lead a guy on and not deliver!

461
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,720
Lead you on?

462
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,080
Nobody hits one of the trokes!

463
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,720
This coulda been fun, now come here!

464
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,200
Now I'm gonna show you what
17.50 plus tips is worth!

465
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,600
Now you're gonna see me score
right between the uprights!

466
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
{y:i}' Stop it!

467
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,400
We gotta see her tits,
are they in the picture?

468
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,000
Where's the frame line?

469
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,720
What in the hell?

470
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,400
Jesus Christ, Harry!

471
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,800
[Harry gimme a break, Josh,
we gotta see some flesh!

472
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,800
That's it, no more!

473
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,200
Next thing you guys are
probably gonna wanna do

474
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,400
is ice my nipples to make 'em stick out!

475
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,200
Why are women always the
ones to be exploited?

476
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,200
What is it with you guys'?

477
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,880
Hey, I'm having a great time!

478
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,080
Oh, really?

479
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,800
Well, would you if you had
to walk around this scene

480
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
with your schlong hanging out?

481
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,280
Only in your case, darling,
it would be a shlort!

482
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,200
Come on, Callie, it's a movie!

483
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Bullshit!

484
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
You know what happens to movies?

485
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,600
People see them, it
seeps into their minds.

486
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Everything we do plants a seed.

487
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,720
The fuck is she talkin' about?

488
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,200
I am talking about the necessity

489
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,000
of this scene, Harry!

490
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,400
Look, ya gotta know, she was raped.

491
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,400
You don't have to show it to know it!

492
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Who the hell wants to hear about it?

493
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,920
It is degrading to women!

494
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,120
It sells tickets!

495
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,400
Well, it shouldn't!

496
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,280
If they keep seeing
'em, I'll keep makin' 'em!

497
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,080
No, no, I am sorry.

498
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,880
There is nothing
redeeming about this shit!

499
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,800
This could be trouble, Arthur.

500
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,200
Well, I didn't want to
write the scene this way!

501
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,000
Told me you were trying

502
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
to say something with this picture!

503
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,200
Maybe we can kill off her character.

504
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,880
Life as a cuisinart?

505
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Maybe we can
rewrite some of this.

506
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,480
Cribbin' actresses, shoulda
done an animated horror film.

507
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,400
Harry, am I getting paid or what?

508
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,320
Roy, what are you talking about?

509
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,200
My check.

510
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,000
You didn't get it'?

511
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,800
No.

512
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,680
Jesus Christ!

513
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,800
I'm gonna fire that secretary!

514
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,400
She can't do this to my
crew, you guys are family!

515
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,800
Look, I'll personally
messenger the check to you.

516
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,600
Can't trust the mail.

517
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,800
Guys workin', what is this, charity?

518
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,080
Jesus Christ!

519
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,480
- Excuse me.
- What?

520
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,320
Mr. sleerik, sorry.

521
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,200
L-
just wanted to
thank you for letting me

522
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,800
be a part of this picture.

523
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,600
Ah, anytime, kid, you're a good actor.

524
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,320
And I was thinking...

525
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,200
look, we'll talk.

526
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,600
' Great.

527
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Arthur?

528
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,000
Your script got us into this

529
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,520
and you're just gonna have to pull us out.

530
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,000
But that isn't my script!

531
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,600
I know she's a pain in the ass,

532
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
but I need her to finish this picture.

533
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,000
What she really needs is the
old six inches behind the barn.

534
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,800
I, I can't...

535
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,520
I'm not asking you to do that,

536
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,000
but you better write something redeeming.

537
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,080
Well, what?

538
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,000
A scene for Callie, I don't know.

539
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,800
Two girls talk about love,

540
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,320
marriage, babies.

541
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,720
Babies?

542
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,400
Yeah, make it poignant.

543
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,400
Redeeming, you know,
life is wonderful crap.

544
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,000
Give me a lot of hope.

545
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Hope.

546
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,600
And set it in the locker
room shower so they're naked.

547
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,200
Things are gettin' crazy!

548
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,080
What is it, is it me, is it the school?

549
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,000
Ever since I got here, I don't feel right.

550
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,600
No, no, wait a minute.

551
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,320
Listen, remember when
you were in high school,

552
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,800
how you thought you'd never get out?

553
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,600
Well, you're livin' and workin' here,

554
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,200
it's kind of the same thing.

555
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,680
No, that's not what I mean.

556
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,880
I don't know, maybe it's that
people actually died here.

557
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,280
It was pretty gruesome.

558
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,000
Before the incidents,

559
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,880
had anything like this
ever happened before?

560
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,600
No, that's why it was such a shock.

561
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,400
I mean, I grew up here.

562
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,680
Crippen high defined normal.

563
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,600
I mean, we did typically normal things.

564
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,320
Look, I'll show ya.

565
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
This is what you wanted to show me?

566
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
Yeah.

567
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,080
An empty locker,
that's very impressive.

568
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,200
No, no no no no, look again, look.

569
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,800
Steve and Cathy.

570
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,600
Steve and Cathy?

571
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,200
This was my locker.

572
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,000
A little heart complete
with cupid's arrow!

573
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,880
Blake, you're a softie!

574
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,400
What do you mean, arrow?

575
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,320
Isn't it just like a man to forget?

576
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,400
No, I never drew that arrow.

577
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,000
That wasn't there yesterday, either.

578
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,800
That's a fresh scratch and
it's right through my name.

579
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,400
Huh, maybe,

580
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
maybe there is something going on.

581
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,280
Like what?

582
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,600
Like whoever did the killings is back.

583
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,600
Yeah, but why?

584
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,080
Because they like it.

585
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Yo, Robbie, are you in here, man?

586
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Come on, bro, where do you
want me to put this stuff, huh?

587
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,000
Can't miss it here.

588
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Man.

589
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,000
What the hell?

590
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,280
Son of a bitch!

591
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
Whoa!

592
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,000
Yo, is that you, man?

593
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,600
Hey, look, come here,
you gotta check this out.

594
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,200
Bro, is that you?

595
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,680
My god!

596
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,280
Help!

597
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Help!

598
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Help, help!

599
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,880
No!

600
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,200
That's what I call blood.

601
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,880
Not that one little
artistic drip you wanna see!

602
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,320
I'm not gonna film it, Harry.

603
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh yes, you will, if you wanna get paid.

604
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,880
It's crass, it's crude, it's...

605
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,600
it's great entertainment!

606
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,720
You see what's happening here, Arthur?

607
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,400
Defend your script!

608
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,400
I wanted to do a psychological thriller.

609
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,120
You call this psychological?

610
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,480
This is blatant abuse of the audience!

611
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,520
What abuse, everyone
loves a good gross-out!

612
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,200
Look, I'm tryin' to do a film

613
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,520
that
- Josh!

614
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,720
Isolates

615
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,480
the brittle edge of sanity.

616
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,280
A simple, normal town

617
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,400
plunged into a series
of ghastly murders, why?

618
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,680
How could it happen, they say.

619
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,400
Nothing ever happens in this town.

620
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,720
And there lies the thread,

621
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,320
the thread that we follow.

622
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,480
We follow it, Harry, to
its horrifying revelation.

623
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,000
And what is that?

624
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Oh, yes.

625
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What is that?

626
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,880
So, you never
saw Cathy after the prom?

627
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,880
No, she, uh,

628
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,280
she just went away.

629
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,880
Why?

630
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,320
I don't know.

631
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,120
We slept together that
night, it was my first time.

632
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,000
Then, she went away to
her grandparents' place

633
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,800
for summer vacation.

634
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,200
When she didn't come back,

635
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,600
I thought I'd done something terrible.

636
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,680
I didn't sleep with another
girl for three years after that.

637
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,200
Uh, uh, that-that Robbie fella, he,

638
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,600
he asked me to mop up.

639
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,680
L-
never seen such a mess.

640
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,000
Must be shootin' some gruesome scenes.

641
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,880
All right, let's clear this up.

642
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,600
Freddie, uh, don't we have
some new pages being xeroxed?

643
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,000
Where's Peter?

644
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,480
Uh, there are three possibilities.

645
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,800
Our, uh, our trusty production assistant

646
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,520
either quit because of no pay,

647
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,000
quit because of being
Harry's whipping post,

648
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,880
or, um, quit because of pressure
to round up local bimbos.

649
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,400
Tss, the body count rises.

650
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,600
Hey, Dillon, didn't you
tell anyone of the grips

651
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,880
just, uh, disappeared, vanished?

652
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,600
That's right.

653
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,000
Took a walk down a dark hallway

654
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,280
and that was all she wrote.

655
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,720
None of this makes sense.

656
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,200
We thought they were quitting!

657
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
We know different now, don't we?

658
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,800
No one heard the screams?

659
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,200
Sure, but you just figured

660
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,800
someone was rehearsing their lines!

661
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,880
They were dropping like flies in there!

662
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,480
How could ya not notice?

663
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
On a low budget film,

664
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,400
you just get so used to working with less,

665
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,320
you expect a certain amount of attrition!

666
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,000
Look, someone doesn't show up for work,

667
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,480
somebody else doubles up on that job!

668
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,680
See, we have one actress play
three different characters.

669
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,680
Just plopped on a new wig!

670
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,480
But the blood, it was all over!

671
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
In a western, everything
gets covered with dirt.

672
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Two days on this movie,

673
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,400
everything I own was covered with blood!

674
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,400
Harry wanted lots and lots of blood.

675
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,000
I guess it just didn't take that much

676
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,680
for the killer to just

677
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,200
casually blend it all together.

678
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,480
There's nothing casual
about any of this!

679
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
I know.

680
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,400
No one inside yet, sir.

681
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
None that we could see.

682
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,800
What the hell happened to you?

683
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,400
There's blood everywhere!

684
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,800
Slippery, just fell.

685
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,880
I slid from Greenway's chemistry class

686
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,880
all the way to brosnahan's English.

687
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,120
Found this, though.

688
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,520
Where was it?

689
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,200
The biology lab.

690
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,200
What do you know about the biology lab'?

691
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,800
They changed every scene
i wrote for that location.

692
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,800
My stuff was butchered!

693
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,800
The animals we use in
our dissections are dead,

694
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,520
though preserved wholly intact,

695
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,200
much like the specimens
you see in these jars.

696
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,720
As you can see,

697
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,800
this rat is in a
condition almost identical

698
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,880
to that when it was first placed
in the preserving solution.

699
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,600
A solution known as formaldehyde.

700
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,680
Now, we must be very careful
when working with this solution

701
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,120
because if inhaled,
these vapors can produce

702
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
quite an adverse reaction,

703
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,600
as Mr. Porter will now demonstrate.

704
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,400
Having a nightmare, Donny?

705
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,880
Yeah, no, I don't, I don't know.

706
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,000
Well, that's because your
gray matter was on holiday.

707
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,800
You were sleeping in my classroom

708
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
for the third time this week.

709
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,520
I'm gonna have to find something

710
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,200
very interesting for you,

711
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,320
and I don't like doing that.

712
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
Not for a worthless, sniveling...

713
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,800
uh, Mr. Birnbaum?

714
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,480
Well, what have we here?

715
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,920
Ah,

716
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,520
your name is Susan?

717
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,800
Yes, the lady in the office

718
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,880
said that you might have
room for another student.

719
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,600
I just started here today,

720
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,720
and all the other classes
this period were full.

721
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
Maybe I'll just go the library.

722
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,600
Oh, no no no, of course,
we have room for you.

723
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,600
Now, uh, let's see.

724
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
Is anyone sitting there?

725
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Let's get back to formaldehyde.

726
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's not just in this rat jar...

727
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,600
hi.

728
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,800
Don Porter.

729
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,320
Susie.

730
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,800
If you ever need to borrow my notes

731
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,000
or anything, just ask.

732
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,720
We aren't all listening,

733
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,800
are we?
- Thanks.

734
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Porter!

735
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,480
Porter, how could anyone be so pathetic.

736
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,200
You're a freak of nature, Porter.

737
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,080
Much like that dodo bird, too weak,

738
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,600
too stupid, too ignorant to survive,

739
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
so nature killed it off.

740
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,400
Everyone, take a look at a
soon-to-be-extinct species,

741
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,000
the donnybird.

742
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,480
Chapter 17 for tomorrow's
dissection examination.

743
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,280
Uh, Susan.

744
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,920
Susan, you have a lot of
extra work to make up.

745
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,400
Yes, I'll start tonight,
I'll catch up in no time.

746
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,600
Oh, I realize your
good intentions, Susan,

747
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,800
but, uh, I think you'll need
some extra-curricular tutoring.

748
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,280
Tutoring, why, Mr. Birnbaum,
i am a straight-a student.

749
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,680
Ah, that was at another school, Susan.

750
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,400
You'll find that I'm far more exacting.

751
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,400
That's why I make myself available

752
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,800
at night to my more promising students.

753
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,880
Excuse me, I gotta talk to him.

754
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,880
I'm busy right now, miss mccomb.

755
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,400
Yeah, most of the time.

756
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,880
Didn't used to be, though,

757
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,720
not when you wanted me coming in at night.

758
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,400
It's ok, I can wait.

759
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
But how come I'm gettin'
c's now instead of a's?

760
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,600
Perhaps if you looked into the mirror,

761
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,400
you could figure that out
for yourself, miss mccomb.

762
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,480
Would you like to drop another grade?

763
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,400
You'd better buzz off.

764
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,000
You want an a, too?

765
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,600
Don't worry, he finishes fast.

766
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,200
Susan?

767
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,480
Uh, that's the warning bell.

768
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,600
I think I better get going.

769
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,800
Richard, Richard, this is officer Blake,

770
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,800
from the crippen police department

771
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,200
and he's investigating the
death of that farley boy

772
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,720
and that, uh, cheerleader that...

773
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,880
oh, yes, yes, sheri Haines,
uh, she was a lovely girl.

774
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,200
Well, how can I help you?

775
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,800
About the murders.

776
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
Oh, yes, grisly affair.

777
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,800
Reminds me of some of my students'

778
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,520
sloppy dissection examinations.

779
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,200
You, uh, told principal kastleman

780
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,800
that you had some thoughts
on who might've done this?

781
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,000
Yes, yes, I believe I do.

782
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,200
Well, anything would be appreciated.

783
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,800
You know, this really isn't very accurate.

784
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,880
I mean, Birnbaum didn't know anything!

785
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,600
That's not the point, cut it.

786
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,600
Well, I thought that's
what the scene was about.

787
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,000
The scene is about
getting finished by 6:30.

788
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,320
I have a crew that wants to go eat dinner!

789
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,800
Yeah, what is for dinner?

790
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,800
Then, if there are no
further interruptions,

791
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm gonna slip quietly into
a hot tub and slit my wrists,

792
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,800
thus providing Harry with more

793
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,680
of his sought-after blood for this epic.

794
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,720
Gate's clean, let's go again.

795
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,200
We are making a movie!

796
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,600
All other life ceases to exist.

797
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,520
There is only the next scene, huh?

798
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,480
Rana pipiens, the common field frog.

799
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
Now, as you all can see,

800
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,320
little Freddie is dead, very dead!

801
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,000
Dead little Freddie, and in a few moments,

802
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,120
you will all have the unique pleasure,

803
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,800
as we try to discover what
makes Freddie Freddie,

804
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,800
as we split him open on your desks.

805
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,400
If you ever want to be a
coroner and carve up people...

806
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,600
are you ok?

807
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,600
You must
first start with frogs.

808
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,920
They're just little creatures!

809
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,400
I can't!

810
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,800
Porter, talking again?

811
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,600
Would you like to share your vast wisdom

812
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,520
with the whole class?

813
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,680
L-
may have to be excused.

814
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,280
What, and miss all the fun?

815
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,000
Mr. Birnbaum, Donny loves animals,

816
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,920
he's very sensitive and...

817
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,720
he's a scared little snot.

818
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,000
What's the matter, Porter?

819
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,200
Are you afraid to go poking
around little Freddie?

820
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,600
Well, that's what I'm here for,

821
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,880
to inspire you.

822
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,400
Now begin by inserting the scalpel.

823
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,120
You'll have to separate the epidermis

824
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,120
from the spinal column.

825
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,080
And then the most rewarding
part of this exercise.

826
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,680
He will insert the scalpel
past the chest wall

827
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,400
and with his free hand, reach in,

828
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,080
firmly grasping the
heart, and tear it out.

829
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,520
I can't!

830
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,000
Let me do it, I know how!

831
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,000
No, he'll do it or he
won't leave this class.

832
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,520
Now, dig in.

833
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,920
Susan?

834
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,200
Is that you, Susan?

835
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,000
Well, you just have a seat
and I'll be right with you.

836
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,400
I'm glad you've changed your mind

837
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,600
about our tutoring sessions.

838
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Susan?

839
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,800
Susan?

840
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,600
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you were one of my students.

841
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,200
As you all can see, little Freddie's dead!

842
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,800
Very dead little Freddie!

843
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,600
But that's what I'm here for,

844
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,920
to inspire you.

845
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,120
In a few moments,

846
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,000
you will all have the unique pleasure

847
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,000
as we split him open on your desks.

848
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,520
As we all try to discover

849
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,720
what makes Freddie, Freddie.

850
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,280
J1 come, you good children

851
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,800
{y:i}41 come and greet your teacher

852
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,920
{y:i}41 come and greet your teacher

853
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,600
j1 be what you learn

854
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,400
j1 you start all over again

855
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,080
j1 how could you ever think

856
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,200
j1 about pleasure and pain

857
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,800
j1 come, you good children

858
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,400
{y:i}41 come and greet your teacher

859
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,680
j1 said all you good children

860
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,520
{y:i}41 come and greet your teacher

861
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,400
j1 now just stand in line

862
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,800
j1 and wait for your turn

863
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
j1 was I the one you need

864
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,400
{y:i}41 the one that you bum

865
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,120
{y:i}41 come and greet your teacher

866
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,400
did he really die that way?

867
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,320
Best as we could piece together.

868
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,080
Sorry, that's a bad choice of words.

869
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm scared!

870
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,200
I think something's going on,

871
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,800
all these people leaving, not showing up.

872
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,920
Well, I heard it was
normal on a film like this.

873
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,600
I don't feel normal about this!

874
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,800
I just think there's somebody out there,

875
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,720
waiting, and I wanna find him.

876
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,120
Or her.

877
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,200
Or it, first.

878
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,600
Ok, let's
write down what we know.

879
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,200
How 'bout a list of names?

880
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,600
Yeah, that's good.

881
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,120
Anyone who you think
is remotely connected.

882
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,520
Hello, Sally, yeah, Harry.

883
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,400
Yeah, listen, I just wanted to
follow up on that interview.

884
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,320
There's a few things i
thought you might like to add.

885
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,600
Well, it seems people are
disappearing from my set!

886
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,400
Yeah, crew members, some actors.

887
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,600
Yeah, well,

888
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,600
you know, I thought it
was nothing at first,

889
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,000
then I had remembered
that you had mentioned

890
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,880
in our first interview that you thought

891
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,800
the murderer may still
be out there somewhere!

892
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yes, I think it could be a missing person.

893
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,800
The police, huh, they
don't know what to do.

894
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's clear for the camera.

895
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,720
Where'd you get this?

896
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,920
Hmm?

897
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,400
Oh, that's my daughter, Cathy.

898
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Cathy Johnson?

899
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,520
No, Cathy kastleman.

900
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,000
May I, please, thank you.

901
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:56,800
No no no, wait a minute,

902
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
this is my girlfriend from high school.

903
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,720
Cathy Johnson.

904
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,520
After all that...

905
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,480
what's going on here?

906
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,720
She used, uh, Johnson.

907
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,920
Didn't want kids to know

908
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,800
that her father was their principal.

909
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,720
So where is she now?

910
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,200
Away-

911
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,520
but where?

912
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,720
Grad school.

913
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,320
When's she coming back?

914
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,200
Hey, are we gonna
shoot this thing or what?

915
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,400
If I knew my motivation,

916
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,520
maybe I could play the scene better.

917
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,200
What's my motivation?

918
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,680
You're dead!

919
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,280
Dead people have no motivation!

920
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,400
They don't do anything!

921
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,400
The horror, the horror!

922
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,480
I wish there was something I could do

923
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,480
to help out, maybe, maybe
i could fix up the story.

924
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,800
Listen, fixing this script
would be like polishing a turd.

925
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,800
Why did you ever wanna
write this thing anyway?

926
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,520
A long time ago,

927
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,600
I went to this high school.

928
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,000
Writing this was like

929
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,400
coming home again.

930
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,200
Could be any of 'em.

931
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,200
Even me.

932
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,000
Would you be serious?

933
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,200
Look, a good detective
doesn't rule out anybody

934
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,400
when he's building a case.

935
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:20,000
You see, the note you
throw out may kill you.

936
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,800
It's so awful.

937
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,600
Come here.

938
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,320
What?

939
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,600
(Jmere!

940
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,880
What?

941
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,000
So, uh, you like my uniform, huh?

942
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,600
Yeah.

943
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,120
Yeah?

944
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,320
Yeah.

945
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,600
J1 late at night in my apartment

946
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,600
j1 I hear the sound of love
coming through the wall

947
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,400
j1 I long for him deep inside me

948
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,400
j1 but here I am, all alone, after all

949
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,400
j1 I'm gonna get into the situation

950
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,280
j1 I called it love, he said infatuation

951
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,600
j1 I've been with boys but
he's the one who satisfies

952
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,680
j1 he's the only man for me

953
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,520
j1 oh, I need him desperately

954
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,320
{y:i}41 man for me, man for me

955
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,800
j1 the end of him, that's what he told me

956
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,800
j1 he looked at me so
warm in light, so goldly

957
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,800
j1 I was naive, he was convincing

958
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,880
j1 my knees were weak when he said

959
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,880
j1 baby hold me

960
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,600
j1 he asked if I need
love and some stability

961
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,600
j1 he said he must protect his masculinity

962
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,720
j1 how can I change his mind,

963
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,680
j1 make him realize

964
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,800
j1 he's the only man for me

965
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,600
j1 oh, I need him desperately

966
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,800
{y:i}41 man for me

967
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,280
Callie, they're onto
us, we know too much!

968
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,600
What?

969
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,800
Christ, my gun's missing!

970
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,400
Blake, what's that noise?

971
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,480
For god's sake, lock the door!

972
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,000
Look, stop, stop!

973
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,200
Honey, they can't hear
you, everybody's gone!

974
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,000
Where?

975
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,600
I don't know, get a grip on yourself!

976
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,000
Blake, I think he's gone.

977
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,400
Someone must have stolen my gun.

978
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,600
Blake!

979
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,920
Oh god, Blake!

980
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,480
Blake, get up, get up!

981
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,800
Oh my god!

982
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,400
Get up!

983
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,800
And, cut!

984
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,800
Yes, great, Callie, that was perfect!

985
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,080
Go again, ok, let's
come around on camera, ok.

986
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,600
No, Amos, stop!

987
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Callie!

988
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,680
You ok?

989
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,400
We were dead.

990
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,400
Come on, just let it go, it's all right.

991
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,600
I can't.

992
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,800
All right, we'll take a walk.

993
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,400
You all right?

994
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,600
I guess.

995
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,120
Just take some deep breaths, ok?

996
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,880
Blake!

997
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,880
What?

998
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,320
Get over here.

999
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,800
That's blood, isn't it?

1000
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,080
Looks like
someone was dragging a body.

1001
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,480
A body?

1002
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,400
I'll check it out.

1003
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,000
You're not leaving me alone.

1004
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,480
On, god!

1005
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,520
What happened here?

1006
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,480
My guess is they dragged the body.

1007
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,600
Hacked it up, flushed it.

1008
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,200
What's that?

1009
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,120
It was Freddie's.

1010
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,600
That's Freddie, the first a.D.,

1011
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,800
first assistant director.

1012
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,400
Not much left.

1013
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,720
That's all you could find of him?

1014
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,720
Um, well, uh, we found
the intestines, sir,

1015
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,080
but, uh, we left them.

1016
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,080
I mean, well, uh, he
just must've eaten, sir,

1017
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,480
because, uh, well, you know.

1018
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,920
Yeah, I can imagine.

1019
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,200
The area sealed off?

1020
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,200
No one in or out.

1021
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,400
Good.

1022
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:37,400
Then whoever did all this
could still be in there.

1023
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,400
I want a room by room search.

1024
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,200
I wouldn't do that.

1025
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,000
" Why not?

1026
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:47,280
We tried that and that's
when things got really tough.

1027
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,600
Whoever or

1028
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,200
whatever it was,

1029
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,000
it just made them mad.

1030
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,200
We have to check every room.

1031
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,600
Maybe we should get some of the others.

1032
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,280
Who will we trust?

1033
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,520
You're right.

1034
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:14,800
Ok, let's go.

1035
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,600
Jeez!

1036
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:52,280
Robbie!

1037
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,520
Turn on some lights.

1038
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,720
Ok, boss.

1039
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,280
God!

1040
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,280
This can't be happening!

1041
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,600
Pull yourself together!

1042
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,000
They were my friends!

1043
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,120
Look, there's nothing,

1044
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,080
there's nothing we can
do for them now, ok?

1045
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,800
We, we gotta call the police.

1046
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,880
No, if we take the time to get help,

1047
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,000
then the son of a bitch could get away!

1048
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,200
What does that mean?

1049
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,880
It means that he's
still here, somewhere.

1050
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,400
Look, you see this?

1051
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,280
This blood hasn't had time to dry.

1052
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,280
Blake?

1053
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,280
Take a look at this.

1054
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,520
It just stops.

1055
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,720
Oh, shit!

1056
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,600
Wait a minute,

1057
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,600
maybe we just can't see where it went.

1058
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,600
Looks like a tunnel.

1059
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,120
Where?

1060
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,280
Down!

1061
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,400
Blake, Blake!

1062
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,720
Are you ok?

1063
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,800
Yeah.

1064
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,200
You ripped it.

1065
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,800
What are you doing?

1066
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,400
Going down there.

1067
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,480
Without a flashlight,
what are you crazy?

1068
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,280
Why does everybody always wanna go down

1069
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,000
into a dark basement without a flashlight?

1070
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,080
Well, grab
one, let's get going!

1071
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,880
It was a spider.

1072
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,520
Uh-huh, yeah, it's dead now.

1073
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:06,600
Are you ok?

1074
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,800
No!

1075
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,480
Oh, Christ,
i can't find the gun.

1076
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,200
Why not?

1077
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,200
Because i
don't have a flashlight.

1078
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,400
Oh.

1079
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,000
What is this place?

1080
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,400
I don't know.

1081
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,600
This room
has to lead someplace!

1082
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,480
Well, let's hope so.

1083
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,200
Shh, shh, shh!

1084
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,000
It's ok, we must be close.

1085
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,120
To what?

1086
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,800
How did you know that?

1087
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Training.

1088
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,400
Jesus!

1089
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,200
What the hell is this?

1090
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,880
I don't know.

1091
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,920
Hey!

1092
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,120
Callie!

1093
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,600
Don't touch 'em!

1094
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,800
What?

1095
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:32,000
I-i-i just comes to warn ya.

1096
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,920
What are you saying?

1097
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,800
Look at their faces.

1098
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,600
Every one of 'em, Cathy kastleman.

1099
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,800
The principal's daughter?

1100
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,200
They all wanted to touch her so, kkeek!

1101
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,600
So kastleman made you kill them.

1102
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,200
No, no, I've been
watchin' him for years.

1103
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,600
I just found this place, I,

1104
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,400
I thought you was him coming back.

1105
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,720
There's one chair left, huh?

1106
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,800
It's for you.

1107
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,720
Blake!

1108
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,000
Kastleman, you honky!

1109
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,280
There never was an Amos!

1110
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,200
"Ooh!

1111
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,800
Ooh, that was fun, I enjoyed that,

1112
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,400
didn't you enjoy that?

1113
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,600
Didn't you enjoy that, Steven?

1114
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,720
Back, get back!

1115
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,800
Didn't you enjoy it, I did.

1116
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,720
You did, too, didn't you, didn't you?

1117
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,920
Yeah.

1118
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You see now, what you've done, Steven?

1119
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:05,000
You have been very
destructive to my classroom.

1120
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,280
You take your seat!

1121
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,600
Take your seat!

1122
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,800
You've been very disruptive.

1123
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
You're gonna have to stay after school.

1124
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,200
Come on, let the girl go!

1125
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,720
Let the girl go!

1126
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,000
No, this one is for me.

1127
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,720
This is one is mine, Steven.

1128
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,520
Put your hands up,
sweetie, and keep 'em up.

1129
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,720
You stay back, get your hands in there.

1130
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,720
Get 'em in there, ah!

1131
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,800
Ooh, not so tight, is it?

1132
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,200
Is it?

1133
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,280
This one's mine, Steven.

1134
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,400
You know why?

1135
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,520
It's an even trade.

1136
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:56,880
You know why?

1137
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,000
Because you, you killed my daughter.

1138
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,000
I loved your daughter!

1139
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:07,520
Yes, yes, yes, you did!

1140
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,480
So much so that she got pregnant

1141
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,400
j1 and she had to give herself an abortion

1142
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,280
go 'head, go 'head!

1143
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,200
Go ahead, you want some of this?

1144
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,200
Do you want it in the ear'?

1145
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,400
Y-y-you said Cathy went away, to school!

1146
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,800
Yes, that's right!

1147
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
She did go away to school.

1148
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,920
She's in, she's in class everyday.

1149
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,280
She's a very good student,

1150
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,200
she's not naughty like you-00 are!

1151
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,280
Would you like to see her?

1152
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,520
Hmm?

1153
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,400
Would you both like to see my sweet Cathy?

1154
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,600
Oh, mmm, oh!

1155
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,880
Oh, ah, oh!

1156
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,600
There she is!

1157
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,800
" Cathy!

1158
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,800
Ah, now, we're going to have

1159
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,600
a little wedding ceremony!

1160
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,480
Flowers, garter,

1161
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,920
she always wanted little purple flowers!

1162
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:37,000
She always wanted a full ceremony,

1163
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,520
she said, "daddy, can
i have a garter belt?"

1164
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,800
Mwah, and you, you my dear,

1165
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,800
you, my sweet, mwah, you're going.

1166
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,120
Not too tight, is it,

1167
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,280
is it?

1168
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,600
You are going to be the maid of honor.

1169
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,480
And you, you, Steven,

1170
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,800
are going to marry Cathy.

1171
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,200
I'm not taking this shit anymore.

1172
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,200
Where, where are you going?

1173
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,520
Home.

1174
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,720
What?

1175
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,400
It's, uh, Monday night football.

1176
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,200
You can't, you can't do that.

1177
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,200
What are you gonna do about it?

1178
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,880
{y:i}L-l'll kill her!

1179
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,880
Go ahead, she hates football.

1180
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,280
Blake?

1181
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,920
I'm sorry, the steelers
are playin' the raiders.

1182
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
You shit!

1183
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,600
Are you crazy?

1184
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,800
You are crazy.

1185
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,600
Class dismissed.

1186
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,520
All right, let's get out of here.

1187
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,400
I thought that you were
really gonna leave me here.

1188
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,400
Nah, I hate football.

1189
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,000
They never got out!

1190
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,280
Everything happened too fast after that.

1191
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,600
No one else got out, it was awful!

1192
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,480
It was awful.

1193
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,200
Pull yourself together, Mr. lyman.

1194
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,600
Now, listen up.

1195
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,600
I want you to show me the basement,

1196
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,720
where that classroom is.

1197
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,400
We're gonna launch a frontal assault!

1198
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,800
All right, Tyler, wrap it up.

1199
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,400
Listen up, you 9w3-

1200
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,720
you ready, check your weapons!

1201
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,280
We don't know what's in there.

1202
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,520
Down there.

1203
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,600
Stand back.

1204
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,600
It's in our hands now.

1205
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
All clear.

1206
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,520
All right, let's move, we're
outta here in 30 seconds.

1207
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,920
Everybody grab your parts!

1208
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,720
Yo, Robbie!

1209
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,200
Robbie, you're a genius!

1210
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,480
Best body shop in town!

1211
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,480
Boy, you guys really know how to party!

1212
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,000
Yeah!

1213
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,600
Blake, they're gonna
find kastleman's body!

1214
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,520
I think that's what Harry wants.

1215
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,280
Some stupid 989!

1216
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,600
Hey, come on, chill out, man!

1217
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,520
Harry paid us to go along
with it anyway, right?

1218
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,120
Yeah, just like Oliver and Jimmy.

1219
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,200
Hey, Robbie, ya had my
neck in that noose, man.

1220
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,800
The fan was buzzing, i
thought I was never gonna

1221
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,800
get outta there alive.

1222
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
What a trip!

1223
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,800
Terrific, Robbie.

1224
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,600
Oh, thank you.

1225
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:28,480
Give me my arm back later.

1226
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,280
Yes, sir.

1227
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,080
Squad car keys?

1228
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,000
Uh, they're in the dumpster.

1229
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,600
Hey, Robbie, save my
head for me, will ya?

1230
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,400
Hold it, hold it!

1231
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,200
Thanks.

1232
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,200
Wear it in good health.

1233
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,400
You know, Harry, i-l can't believe

1234
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,280
you had this planned from the beginning.

1235
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,600
I didn't know it was gonna work

1236
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,920
until Callie and Blake
discovered that kastleman

1237
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,400
was the real killer!

1238
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,880
Do you know how much publicity
this is gonna generate?

1239
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,800
They all died but the film survived!

1240
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,800
It's gonna bank a mint!

1241
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,720
Consider some
serious therapy, Harry.

1242
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,280
I'll work on it.

1243
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,400
Next time, for real.

1244
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,600
Check all those
bodies, behind those bars there.

1245
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,200
Jesus, what a mess!

1246
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:55,120
{y:i}' Ha!

1247
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:01,920
Chief?

1248
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,800
Check that boiler room out!

1249
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:05,800
This is the most bizarre thing

1250
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,400
I've ever seen, this is
the work of a real sicko.

1251
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,600
{y:i}' Cathy?

1252
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,400
Good, clean hit!

1253
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,720
Self-defense.

1254
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,200
I want pictures of all this mess,

1255
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,080
and get forensic on it right away.

1256
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,080
The hell happened?

1257
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,200
They were all dead!

1258
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,320
Mutilated, we saw them!

1259
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,280
We did see them!

1260
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,000
Some sicko must've carted them away.

1261
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,000
You mean, someone is still out there?

1262
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,520
Well,

1263
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,200
that's the way we gotta play it.

1264
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,800
Wh, h-how do we fill out the reports?

1265
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,800
We've got no forms to cover this!

1266
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,600
Shouldataken that NYPD offer.

1267
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,080
New York can't be as bad as all this.

1268
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,680
Well, dad, they're gone.

1269
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,880
They didn't want the truth,

1270
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,000
but they'll be back.

1271
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,120
They always do sequels.

1272
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,280
And I'll be waiting!

1273
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,600
No rewrites next time.

1274
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Dad!

1275
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,200
J1 I love it when the guy gets the girl

1276
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,880
j1 in the Nick of time

1277
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,200
{y:i}41 so they can make a getaway

1278
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,800
j1 I love when the monster appears

1279
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,680
j1 at the top of the stairs

1280
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,680
j1 and runs around to get his prey

1281
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,080
j1 I like

j1 I love those scary movies

1286
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,880
j1 I love it when they walk down the hall

1287
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:20,600
j1 when they stay in tight

1288
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,120
j1 and the people start to disappear

1289
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,920
j1 I love it when you can't hear a sound

1290
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,600
j1 then suddenly

1291
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,600
j1 screams are all that you can hear

1292
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,000
