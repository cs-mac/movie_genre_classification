- Ah, Mr Preston.
- You're Longbarrow.

91
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,165
Yes, I saw you arrive.
I must apologise...

92
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:19,124
Hey, you boy. See to my luggage.
What's the number of my suite?

93
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,457
I’ve arranged all that. There is only
one suite available, Mr Preston,

94
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,582
- but I have secured it for you.
- How do you do, Mr Longbarrow?

95
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,874
- Why didn't you meet the boat?
- Your cable arrived half an hour ago.

96
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,999
- As you expressly desired...
- Mr Preston?

97
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:39,165
- Yes?
- Have you any news of the expedition?

98
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:43,915
- I’ve only just arrived from England.
- Our readers would like your view, sir.

99
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:48,374
- Your readers?
- I represent the Cairo Evening Sun.

100

Ah, well now, gentlemen,

101
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,624
you can tell your readers we are
most concerned about the expedition.

102
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,374
My own son Paul is, as you may know,
a member of Sir Basil’s party.

103
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,040
I came here to ascertain
what's being done to find them.

104
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,957
Isn't that so, Barbara?

105
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,874
- Yes, Stanley.
- Is your son an archaeologist, too, sir?

106
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,749
He is indeed. A very brilliant boy.
Oh, this is my wife.

107
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,832
How do you do?

108
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,790
I don't know whether you are aware, but
I’m holding a press conference tomorrow.

109
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,749
- Have you arranged that?
- 10 o'clock sharp.

110
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:25,790
- Sharp?
- I don't want you to be kept waiting.

111
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:30,082
- We just arrived. Where is it being held?
- At the Restoration House.

112
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,832
- The what?
- It’s a place of Sir Basil’s.

113
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,999
It’s where all the curios
and things he finds are brought...

114
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,624
- I see.
- ..to be sent to the museums.

115
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,582
Mr Preston, sir,
just one photograph, please?

116
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,207
Oh, right. My dear?

117
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:55,165
- Thank you, sir.
- Not at all.

118
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,874
See you tomorrow, gentlemen.
Where's this suite of ours?

119
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,624
Perhaps if you would allow me.
After you, Mrs Preston.

120
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,374
- I would like to make one point clear.
- Yes, Mr Preston, sir.

121
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,915
- I don't like being ignored.
- I can see that. Quite understandable.

122
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,457
My general impression is that the press
are more interested in Sir Basil Walden.

123
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:19,999
- We can very soon rectify that, sir.
- If you are my press representative,

124
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:24,332
you'd better improve on this guff
I’ve been reading back in England.

125
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,874
Without me, there is no expedition.

126
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,999
- I don't think you quite understand...
- I only understand results.

127
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,540
Oh.

128
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,707
Thank you very much.

129
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,249
- Hm, not as bad as I expected.
- I’m so glad it meets with your approval.

130
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,249
Very pleasant, Mr Longbarrow.
More light?

131
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,999
Oh, certainly, Mrs Preston, yes.

132
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:53,040
There is a good view from here.
You can see the desert quite plainly.

133
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,582
What about the bathroom?

134
00:12:55,708 --> 00:13:00,540
I’m afraid there's no bathroom as such.
I’m sure there's a wash basin.

135
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:04,290
At least there should be.
Shall I ascertain?

136
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,124
Yes, there is a wash basin, Mr Preston.
I’m afraid there's no convenience.

137
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,457
So sorry, Mr Preston.

138
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,749
Did you, ah, have a nice journey,
Mrs Preston?

139
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,082
Quite pleasant, Mr Longbarrow.

140
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:25,832
Naturally, our thoughts are
with those poor men in the desert.

141
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:31,290
Our son Paul, Sir Basil, Harry Newton -
what a nice young man he is.

142
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:35,249
- Yes, indeed, isn't he?
- I hope and pray they're all right.

143
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,790
I’ve got £12,000 tied up in this
that says they've got to be all right.

144
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,749
And this young girl, Sir Basil’s
assistant. What's her name?

145
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:48,290
Claire de Sangre, Mrs Preston.
She goes on all his expeditions.

146
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:52,624
- They say she's a brilliant linguist.
- How many search parties are looking?

147
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,749
- Three, sir.
- Double that. Right away.

148
00:13:55,875 --> 00:14:00,707
- Very good. It is siesta time...
- Don't give me any excuses.

149
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:05,040
Just you go and wake them up.
I intend to get things moving fast.

150
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,582
- Get along with you.
- Very good, sir.

151
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,040
Is there anything I can get for you,
Mrs Preston?

152
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:15,582
Yes, you can order me some beer.
Make sure it's cold.

153
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,707
Very good, sir.

154
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,957
- Anything you want?
- Nothing, Stanley.

155
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,082
Yes, you can see the desert from here.

156
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,582
How the devil did
that fool Walden get himself lost?

157
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,915
(Wind howls)

158
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:55,499
No chance of water from there, sir.
The sand's choked everything.

159
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,915
How long do you reckon, sir?

160
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,040
This? It could blow itself out
by the morning.

161
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,415
You can never tell in the desert.

162
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,790
I’ve given you all a rough journey.

163
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,082
Don't blame yourself.
We've had bad luck.

164
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,874
Uh-huh.
Can't put it all down to bad luck.

165
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,832
We started on the wrong day, according
to Claire. Friday the 13th, wasn't it?

166
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,582
I remember Claire mentioned it
at the time.

167
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,749
- Sorry.
- No, I should have listened to you.

168
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:42,290
But that's in the past.
What about the future, Claire?

169
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,832
- We've still got one?
- Of course we have!

170
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:50,874
- Well, Claire?
- We'll find the tomb. It’s not far away.

171
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,832
What makes you so sure?

172
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,915
It’s the same feeling I had
when I told you the porters would desert.

173
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,999
And the traders' route out of Mezzara.

174
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:05,207
Yes, you said that would disappear.
You were right.

175
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:09,499
Hope the Derby's on when we get back!
I’m taking Claire with me.

176
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,457
I could be wrong, Harry.

177
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:17,624
If my reckoning hadn't gone adrift, we
should be on the side of the tomb now.

178
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:23,040
I’ve been trying to work it out. Allowing
for compass error or the storm or both,

179
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,165
we can't be more than a few miles from it.

180
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,707
The question is shall we go on

181
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:33,457
or shall we try to find the oasis
we left three days ago?

182
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,374
We've got just enough water to get back.

183
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,999
It’s your decision, sir.

184
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:42,665
No, Paul, it's only fair to put it to you.

185
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,790
If we go on,
we go farther away from the water.

186
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,874
Well, I think we should take a chance.

187
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,207
Harry?

188
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,332
I’m gambling on Claire.

189
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:03,790
Having predicted the disasters, it'd be
a pity to miss her one ray of hope!

190
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,499
We're all agreed, then?

191
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,832
I know we'll find the tomb,
and we'll survive the desert.

192
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:17,790
Well, this calls for a celebration.
One mouthful of water each, my hearties!

193
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,124
But when the desert is behind us
begins the real danger.

194
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,582
And some of us won't survive.

195
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:46,165
As you know, gentlemen,
the primary object of this expedition

196
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:51,499
is to prove my theory that the mummified
figure wearing the seal of a pharaoh

197
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,457
is not that of Kah-to-Bey,
but that of Prem,

198
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:59,582
the slave who received the seal
from the young prince when he lay dying.

199
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:04,665
If we find his tomb, we shall have proved
a point that's been debated for 20 years.

200
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,790
We believe that this is not the mummy
of Kah-to-Bey, but that of Prem,

201
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:13,457
the slave who buried him and was himself
buried as a pharaoh wearing their seal.

202
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:18,082
Records that have only recently come
to light refer to the Rock of Death.

203
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:22,790
And close by, we believe,
lies the tomb of the real Pharaoh.

204
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:27,332
Well, gentlemen, I hope I’ve been able
to provide all the information you require.

205
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,290
- Thank you, sir. Most informative.
- Any questions?

206
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,832
How many parties are out searching
for Sir Basil, sir?

207
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,957
Three at the moment. Three more today.
I’m sparing no expense to find him.

208
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,832
- And you won't spare yourself either?
- How do you mean?

209
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:48,124
- You will join one of the search parties?
- Yes, Stanley, of course.

210
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,499
Of course.

211
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:54,582
Well, gentlemen, if that's all, good day.

212
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:58,915
Thank you, sir. I wish you a safe journey.
I’m sure we all do.

213
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:03,707
- Thank you. Longbarrow!
- Yes, Mr Preston, at your elbow, sir.

214
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,249
I shall be joining one of the expeditions.

215
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,207
- So I understood, sir.
- See that it's the best equipped.

216
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,332
- With the best guides.
- Naturally, Mr Preston. Of course.

217
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,415
(Wind howls)

218
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,165
(Wind drops)

219
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,957
I think it's finished!

220
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,749
Claire!

221
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:03,540
You were right, Claire.
We're not far away.

222
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:12,249
"At this place died
my beloved prince Kah-to-Bey."

223
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:19,124
- Can you go on, Claire?
- It gives the year.

224
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,249
But I can't read the rest.

225
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,540
Well, this is it!

226
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,290
Shall we leave everything?

227
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:32,082
Yes, yes.
Just bring the guns and the water.

228
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:42,749
We'd better take the lanterns.
Bring them will you, Claire?

229
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,332
The lanterns, Paul.

230
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:37,290
Aaargh!

231
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,832
(Snarls in ancient language)

232
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,665
(Speaks in Arabic)

233
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,624
All right, Paul.

234
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,415
What was he saying?

235
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:08,207
He says that death awaits all who disturb
the resting place of Kah-to-Bey.

236
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:12,624
That tomb must be pretty near.
Ask him where it is.

237
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,957
(ln Arabic)

238
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,415
(Rants)

239
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:36,332
He says he's the keeper of the tomb.
His name is Hasmid Ali.

240
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:40,457
He says why should he reveal
the whereabouts of the tomb to us

241
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:45,790
when he and his family have guarded
the secret for centuries? Well...

242
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,499
(Small rocks fall)

243
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,457
Can you decipher that, Claire?

244
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,457
"Rest in peace...

245
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,290
"..Kah-to-Bey,

246
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,957
"my beloved prince."

247
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,124
Ah!

248
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,040
Your knife, Harry! Quick, your knife!

249
00:24:56,958 --> 00:25:00,582
- Get me out in the air.
- Yes, sir. Steady.

250
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,124
(Horse whinnies)

251
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,749
Harry?

252
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:51,082
- What is it?
- I’m not sure.

253
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,999
Do you think our friend back there
is bringing some of his chums?

254
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,415
It’s more than likely.

255
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:19,915
- Wait!
- Let's go this way!

256
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:23,332
It’s your father!

257
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,124
- Hello, Father!
- Paul, my boy! Thank God I found you!

258
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,665
I’d almost given you up. It’s a great
moment. Wonderful to see you, Harry.

259
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,874
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks, sir.

260
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,582
(Longbarrow)
Pity it's too dark for a photograph!

261
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:46,582
We arrived none too soon.
What happened to you?

262
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,999
Get some food and drink.

263
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:52,124
- Yes, Mr Preston.
- Get moving, man!

264
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,457
- How did you find us, Father?
- I met your porters. They deserted you?

265
00:26:56,583 --> 00:27:00,415
- Yes.
- Lucky they did! We collared a couple.

266
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:05,165
They showed us where you were heading.
Then we stumbled on your tent.

267
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:09,332
I don't think you've met.
Claire de Sangre, Sir Basil’s assistant.

268
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:12,290
- How do you do? Where is Walden?
- Over here.

269
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,624
I’m afraid we had a bit of bad luck.

270
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:24,582
- Sir Basil has had a serious snake bite.
- Really? Is this the site of the tomb?

271
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:29,290
- We can't be sure, but we think it is.
- Well, is it the site or isn't it?

272
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:33,415
- Ah, Walden. How are you feeling?
- Not too bad, thank you.

273
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:38,040
Got bitten by a snake, I hear.
What's all this mystery about the tomb?

274
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:43,374
It’s no mystery. We think we found it.
We can't be sure until we've excavated.

275
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,915
I’ll show you what Sir Basil means.
Only watch out for snakes!

276
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:52,915
Oh, well, you can explain it to me.
We don't want to leave Sir Basil.

277
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:57,040
- How long will it take?
- I can't say without a proper survey.

278
00:27:57,166 --> 00:28:01,790
I imagine the rocks are pretty thick.
We may need small charges of dynamite.

279
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:06,874
- That means sending back to Mezzara.
- We'll manage without dynamite.

280
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,290
Start your survey at sun up.

281
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:13,499
My porters are equipped to hack through
any thickness of rock you name.

282
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:18,582
- They're bringing the food and drink.
- Stay with them, man! Hustle them along!

283
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,915
What are those men doing over there?
Tell them to unload the equipment!

284
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:25,040
Come along there!

285
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,207
(Preston) 'l started excavating

286
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:03,207
'on the 10th of July, 1920.

287
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:08,749
'From the outset, we realised the work
would be arduous and dangerous.

288
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:11,832
'The heat was fantastic

289
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:17,790
'in the dark, cramped quarters
in which we had to work.'

290
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:22,832
We slaved on
through the broiling heat of the day.

291
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,790
"..heat...

292

"of the day."

293
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,332
There was always danger

294
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,540
of mutiny among the porters.

295
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:41,374
Twice I had to hold them at gunpoint.

296
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,540
"..at...

Well, where's the body?

299
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:35,499
I want you all to understand
what happened.

00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:40,582
Normally, as you know, the tomb
of a Pharaoh bears the necropolis seal.

301
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:44,707
And the tomb itself is
very much more elaborate than this.

302
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:47,249
Now theory is merging with fact.

303
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:51,207
The slave Prem buried his master,
sealed the tomb with rock.

304
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:55,957
- It was the best he could do.
- Is there a body or isn't there?

305
00:30:56,083 --> 00:31:00,082
If you will contain your impatience,
Mr Preston, until I’ve finished.

306
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:05,207
In this canopic chest,
we shall undoubtedly find the urns

307
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,749
containing the viscera of the Pharaoh.

308
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:11,290
- Viscera?
- The heart and intestines.

309
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:14,040
- Harry, is your camera ready?
- Almost there, sir.

310
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:19,582
I think we're going to find one of
the earliest forms of mummification.

311
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:29,749
When a pharaoh was entombed,
a keeper or guard was appointed.

312
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:34,832
This position was handed down
from generation to generation.

313
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:39,624
Perhaps in this instance the keeper was
the madman we met in the cavern.

314
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,665
Possibly.

315
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:45,874
Some of the guards were dedicated men,

316
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,915
but many of them were villains
who rifled the tombs

317
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,665
that they were supposed to guard.

318
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:58,207
Hasmid Ali may have
discovered the tomb himself

319
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,957
or the secret may have been
passed down to him by his family.

320
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,582
Whatever he thinks,

321
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:11,082
he certainly seems to regard himself
as the keeper of the tomb.

322
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,165
Preserved in sand for 4,000 years.

323
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,582
Fantastic!

324
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:47,040
As you say, Mr Preston...fantastic!

325
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,915
The shroud of Kah-to-Bey.

326
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:03,290
And now perhaps you'd be interested to
know the meaning of these hieroglyphics.

327
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,124
Claire, you're better at this than I.
Will you?

328
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:15,499
- I’m sorry! I can't read the words.
- What do you mean, you can't?

329
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:20,457
- You're the language expert, aren't you?
- It’d be wrong to read them, Mr Preston.

330
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:25,040
- Wrong and dangerous.
- Is she some superstitious crank?!

331
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:29,374
Claire, I don't understand.
What's your objection?

332
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,415
The words refer to the Spirit of the Tomb
and the sacred words of life and death.

333
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:39,874
- Spirit of the Tomb? Camera ready?
- Always, sir.

334
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,207
I want a photograph.

335
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:45,249
First the shroud, then the body.

336
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,457
Right. Quite still, sir.

337
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:52,290
Walden, I want to get these
back to Mezzara as soon as possible.

338
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:59,207
Prem, the devoted slave,
who buried his master, Kah-to-Bey.

339
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:04,040
It is fitting that they should be together
after all these centuries.

340
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:08,707
One likes to think
they have found each other

341
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:13,124
on some celestial plane
and are watching our humble effort

342
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,749
to give them their place in history.

343
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:21,749
(Voice echoes) ..their place in history.

344
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:27,749
(Reporter) It’s good to see you've kept
your sense of humour, Mr Preston.

345
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:33,332
Any questions, gentlemen?

346
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:37,665
I understand Sir Basil Walden was taken
ill. Can you tell us about his illness?

347
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:42,540
I’m afraid I can't. Sir Basil was bitten
by a snake on his journey to the tomb,

348
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,290
but appeared to have made
a good recovery.

349
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,415
But I understand he's suffered
poor health for a number of years.

350
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:51,999
I arranged for him to go into hospital.

351
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,624
We're doing all we can for him.

352
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,374
Mr Preston, it appears from what you've
told us that a great deal of the credit

353
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,915
for the safe return of the expedition
goes to you.

354
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:05,457
Hardly fair on Sir Basil, I think!

355
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:09,999
It’s true I was fortunate enough
to stumble on them, shall we say,

356
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:14,540
- when they were at their lowest ebb.
- So sorry, Mr Preston.

357
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:18,915
With the help of my son, I arranged
for the return of this sacred thing,

358
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:23,457
this relic of Ancient Egypt.
Together, we brought it back to Mezzara

359
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:28,415
so that Kah-to-Bey can take his place
in the history of this great country.

360
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:32,957
Mr Preston, is it true a curse might fall
on members of the expedition?

361
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:35,207
Wasn't there some sort of warning?

362
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,457
We're not worried, gentlemen.
Neither are we superstitious.

363
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,749
But there was a warning.
Explain that.

364
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:43,874
Explain it?

365
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,207
We had a job to do and I feel that
Sir Basil himself, when he recovers,

366
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:52,582
will be the first to admit that
we didn't acquit ourselves too badly.

367
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,124
No, indeed not, Mr Preston.

368
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,082
Will you excuse me, gentlemen?

369
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,707
Sir Basil must have been moved
from the hospital within an hour.

370
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,832
- How do you know that?
- I went back.

371
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:13,832
The superintendent was unavailable.

372
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,374
Nobody would tell me
where he's been taken to.

373
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,749
This is Chief Inspector Barrani. He says
Sir Basil has been removed to an asylum.

374
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:24,707
The Mezzara lunatic asylum.

375
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,290
I propose to leave this day week.

376
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:35,165
Get Paul to help crate up
the mummy and the shroud.

377
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:39,499
- We can ship them out at the same time.
- We shall need a police licence, sir.

378
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:42,624
- Arrange it. It shouldn't be difficult.
- (Knock at door)

379
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,749
Come in.

380
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:48,874
Ah, Paul, come in, my boy. Have a drink.
Longbarrow, give him a drink.

381
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,624
- No, thank you. I’d like a word, Father.
- Any time, my boy, any time.

382
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,749
- Alone, if you don't mind.
- You have work to do. Get on with it.

383
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,874
Yes. Excuse me.

384
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,624
- Do you want me to go, Paul?
- No, that's all right, Mother.

385
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,749
- Sure you won't join me?
- Yes, quite sure, thank you.

386
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,499
That press conference went well.

387
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,415
- Very well, yes.
- What is it, Paul?

388
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:18,707
When did you first learn
Sir Basil had been sent to an asylum?

389
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:21,332
When? When your mother told us.

390
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:25,457
- Frankly, I’m not surprised.
- You're not surprised?

391
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:29,582
I must say, he behaved very strangely
on that return journey.

392
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,915
Of course,
he was in poor physical shape.

393
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,707
That may have caused
mental derangement.

394
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:40,457
It’s up to the authorities to decide
on the correct treatment. Not for us.

395
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,665
Who sent him there, Father?

396
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:45,624
Why, the hospital authorities,
I suppose.

397
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,457
- Did you send him?
- Look here!

398
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:53,207
Sir Basil is as sane as you or I! Someone
must have bribed the authorities. You?

399
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,832
Paul, we've always been very close,

400
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:59,582
but that doesn't mean
you can level these sort of accusations.

401
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:04,707
- There's no truth in what I’m saying?
- You are talking to your father.

402
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:09,457
If you're subjecting me to this
cross-examination, you'd better leave.

403
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:13,999
You wanted him out of the way. You hated
the idea of him stealing your thunder.

404
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,332
I’ve watched you taking
every advantage of his illness,

405
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,207
stealing credit for his work,

406
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:24,957
lying to the press and singing your own
praises so we're sick with embarrassment!

407
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:29,249
- How dare you!
- It’s sheer persecution of a sick man!

408
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:33,374
- And a great man.
- Oh, I know he's a hero of yours.

409
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,499
He certainly is!

410
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:39,249
And now he's out of the way,
your own star can shine more brightly.

411
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:43,999
Good old Preston. He saved the expedition
and found the mummy of Kah-to-Bey.

412
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:47,415
- Three cheers! Give him a knighthood!
- Get out!

413
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:51,374
He hasn't got your millions,
but he's worth ten of you.

414
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,499
Paul, please go.

415
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:58,249
Yes, I’m going to the asylum and
somehow I’m going to get him out of there.

416
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:04,749
That won't be necessary, Mr Preston.

417
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:09,499
I have to inform you that Sir Basil Walden
escaped from the asylum half an hour ago.

418
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,707
If he returns to the hotel,
I expect you to inform me.

419
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,832
Good night, gentlemen.

420
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,124
Inspector!
There's been a terrible mistake.

421
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,874
- This should never have happened.
- That is hardly my concern, Mr Preston.

422
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,999
- Your men are searching for him now?
- They are indeed.

423
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:43,332
- And if they find him?
- Escapees are treated as criminals.

424
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:47,457
It is necessary, you understand,
for the safety of the community.

425
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:51,415
- What will happen to him?
- That will depend on his behaviour.

426
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:56,457
- If he is violent, he may be shot.
- He won't be violent! He's a sick man!

427
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,457
In that case, he has nothing to fear.

428
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:04,165
- I will contact you when he is caught.
- Can I help you look for him now?

429
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:08,915
No, Mr Preston. This is a matter for
the police. I advise you to stay here.

430
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:19,082
I shall be in my room.
Any messages, contact me immediately.

431
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,415
I don't care how late it is. Immediately.

432
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:33,332
- You heard all that?
- Yes, everything.

433
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:36,082
Oh, Paul, how can we help him?

434
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,165
(Breathes heavily)

435
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,624
(Whispers) This way, quick. I help you.

436
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,124
I help you. Quick, quick.

437
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:09,332
(Bird caws)

438
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:13,082
Come. Come in.

439
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:15,415
Come in. Ah ha ha.

440
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:19,540
Come, come. Come.

441
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:22,499
Sit down.

442
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,624
Hee hee, sit down.

443
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,749
Ah ha ha!

444
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:31,874
You are Sir Basil Walden.
I am Haiti. I tell your fortune.

445
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,999
Haiti's the greatest fortune teller
in the whole of Egypt.

446
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:39,415
I look into the crystal so.

447
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,124
I see death.

448
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,207
You are going to die very soon.

449
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,749
But not the way you think.

450
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:53,165
Let me rest. Please...

451
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:58,332
- Give me somewhere to rest.
- You will soon be dead.

452
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:01,082
Then you can rest.

453
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:03,207
Death can be sweet.

454
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:08,082
Sweet death. I pray for it
because I am old and tired.

455
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,499
You pray because you are sick.

456
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:15,040
There is nothing left for you
but death.

457
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:20,124
My son, Hasmid.

458
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,499
Your son...

459
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,832
He will attend you.

460
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:34,165
The Spirit of the Tomb
will journey from death into life.

461
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:38,499
He will punish you
for what you have done him.

462
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:41,707
And one by one
the others will follow you.

463
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:45,124
It is in the crystal!

464
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,207
Help me, please...

465
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,749
It is in the crystal.

466
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,749
Soon the Spirit will move.
I see him now.

467
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,915
He is dead,

468
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:09,332
but he has the power to move.

469
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,415
And kill.

470
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,415
(Speaks in ancient language)

471
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:45,207
Death is coming.

472
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:48,332
Prepare yourself for death.

473
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,540
(Snapping sound)

474
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:57,040
Aaaargh! Aaargh!

475
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:19,624
(Sings quietly to himself)

476
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,374
Aaargh!

477
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,124
Aaaargh!

478
00:50:26,958 --> 00:50:30,540
This is terrible news, Chief Inspector.
Terrible.

479
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:34,624
Yes, Mr Preston.
I imagined you would be very upset.

480
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,790
- Any idea who could have done it?
- No, I have no idea, Mr Preston.

481
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:42,665
As a formality, I shall have to ask you
to identify the body.

482
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:46,249
I’m afraid it is not a pleasant sight.

483
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:54,040
Well, Mr Preston?

484
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:57,374
It is Sir Basil, yes.
Who could have done it?

485
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:02,249
I suspect nobody at the moment. I was
hoping that you might be able to help me.

486
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,290
I? I have no idea.

487
00:51:04,416 --> 00:51:07,040
- Your son perhaps?
- No, Inspector.

488
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:10,249
Are you aware of any enemies
Sir Basil might have had?

489
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:13,582
- Someone with a grudge perhaps?
- Nobody, no.

490
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:15,915
Strangely enough, the murder coincides

491
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,249
with the loss of the shroud
covering the body of Kah-to-Bey.

492
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:22,832
- The sacred shroud? It’s been stolen?
- It is not there.

493
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:26,040
The caretaker and the sweeper
have both been questioned.

494
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,665
Neither of them has even noticed
its absence.

495
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:32,290
Is there any connection between
the murder of Sir Basil and this?

496
00:51:32,416 --> 00:51:36,540
Who can tell? You are returning
to your hotel, gentlemen?

497
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,790
- Yes.
- Thank you.

498
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:41,207
I shall be able to find you
if I want you.

499
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,832
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day.

500
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:46,207
A terrible thing. Quite terrible...

501
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:48,874
Have you made arrangements
for crating the mummy?

502
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,165
Yes, Mr Preston. I contacted the local
undertaker, a very excellent man. He's...

503
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:56,207
Good. We may be leaving earlier
than I thought.

504
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,832
I think there's a boat leaving
tomorrow night.

505
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:02,665
- Find out about available passages.
- Very well, Mr Preston.

506
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,790
I suppose
you've broken the news to Claire?

507
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:47,707
Yes, I did, but I thought I’d spare her
the ordeal of coming with us.

508
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:50,249
And you're blaming me, aren't you?

509
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,249
Yes, I’m afraid I am.

510
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,665
Why don't you accuse me of
murdering him and have done with it?

511
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,582
- I’m not accusing you of anything.
- Thank you.

512
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,790
But I don't see why you're so anxious
to leave Mezzara.

513
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:05,624
Sir Basil was virtually an employee
of yours and he's been murdered.

514
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,290
- You should stay and help the police.
- I don't need your advice!

515
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,249
- You saw him?
- Yes.

516
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:25,165
Barbara, I want you to pack your things.
We're getting out.

517
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:29,082
There's no point in remaining here
any longer.

518
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:32,665
I see. Do you feel
some kind of premonition?

519
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:35,915
- What do you mean?
- Do you?

520
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:38,415
- How long have we been married?
- 26 years.

521
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:42,999
Have I once given you the impression
that I’m subject to premonitions?

522
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:46,957
No, I don't think you were ever one
to indulge yourself in that way.

523
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:53,249
I was thinking of that strange man
they found in the tomb before you arrived

524
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:57,040
and his warning of disaster
to whoever violated the tomb.

525
00:53:57,166 --> 00:53:59,165
- (Knock at door)
- Yes?

526
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:06,457
I trust you will pardon this intrusion,
Mr Preston... Mrs Preston.

527
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:08,582
What is it, Inspector?

528
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:13,290
Until I have finished my investigations,
I must request you to remain in Mezzara.

529
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,749
Why?

530
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,665
I may wish to call upon you
for further information.

531
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:21,999
I’ve told you all I know. As far
as I’m aware, Sir Basil had no enemies.

532
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:25,124
In my opinion,
this is the work of some local fanatic.

533
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,957
Fanatic? Why do you say that,
Mr Preston?

534
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:31,832
I’m using the term loosely.
Some maniac without motive or reason.

535
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:35,332
In any case, I must insist
on my rights as a British citizen.

536
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:38,665
I intend to leave as soon
as I can arrange a suitable passage.

537
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:43,415
In that case, I’m afraid you will become
the guests of the police department.

538
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,749
And in this event, I should warn you

539
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:50,165
that our prisons are not exactly
what I would choose for a holiday.

540
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:53,707
Perhaps you will be good enough
to reconsider your position.

541
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,790
Thank you, Mr Preston.

542
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,582
Good day.

543
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:03,457
It’s insufferable!

544
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:07,790
- What are you afraid of?
- I’m not afraid.

545
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:11,749
I’m merely concerned for the welfare
of the people in my charge.

546
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,874
- That includes you.
- That's very kind of you, Stanley.

547
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,499
But I don't really think you need
concern yourself on my account.

548
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:21,124
You see, I did not enter the tomb.

549
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:41,082
Harry, didn't you take a photograph
of the shroud when it was uncovered?

550
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:43,040
- Yes.
- Did you develop it?

551
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:46,499
- Yes, but I haven't run off a print.
- Could I see the negative?

552
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:50,499
Well, certainly. It’s in my hotel room.
Do you want to see it now?

553
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:52,707
- Yes, please.
- All right.

554
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,332
(Man shouts in Arabic)

555
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,749
Oh, there you are.

556
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,499
- Would you make a print, Harry?
- Yes, certainly.

557
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:37,457
I want to examine the hieroglyphics
in detail.

558
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:42,499
I have a feeling the shroud may hold
the key to Sir Basil’s murder.

559
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:48,707
When we first saw the shroud, Sir Basil
asked you to decipher the hieroglyphics.

560
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:49,832
Yes.

561
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:52,749
You said they referred
to the spirit of the tomb

562
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:57,499
and the sacred words of life and death,
but to repeat them might be dangerous.

563
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,582
Do you still think so?

564
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:04,207
Yes, they seem to imbue whoever uttered
them with some strange, mystical power.

565
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,915
I had the feeling
that if I spoke the words,

566
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:11,499
I would be animating some horrible thing
that might be uncontrollable.

567
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:16,499
- To bring something to life?
- Yes, and also to destroy.

568
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,582
I think we ought to remind ourselves
we're living in the 20th century.

569
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,832
On the other hand...

570
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:26,457
Yes?

571
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:30,082
Last night, just as I was packing up,
I looked through the window.

572
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:34,749
I thought it was my imagination
and at the time, I dismissed it.

573
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,082
But now I wonder...

574
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,457
(Paul) Go on.

575
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:44,749
I thought I saw the huge shadow
of a man walking in the alleyway.

576
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:50,040
If my imagination wasn't
playing me a trick...

577
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,624
(Bird squawks)

578
00:58:42,583 --> 00:58:44,957
(Speaks in ancient language)

579
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,749
(Continues in ancient language)

580
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:05,374
(Carriage rolls by)

581
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:06,207
Aaargh!

582
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,124
Aaaargh!

583
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,457
Aargh!

584
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:13,790
Aargh, aargh, aargh!

585
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:41,374
- What's the latest news on the murder?
- Sorry, I’ve nothing to say.

586
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,957
Was Mr Newton present
for the opening of the tomb?

587
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,915
I can't answer any questions.

588
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:48,749
- Has Mr Preston heard the news?
- I’m about to tell him.

589
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,165
Is there a connection
between these murders?

590
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,374
Please, I’ve been very co-operative.

591
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,165
But I cannot speak
on Mr Preston's behalf. Excuse me.

592
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:01,290
It is terrible, Mr Preston.
Really terrible, sir.

593
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:03,415
What is it?

594
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:08,749
- Poor boy. How dreadful!
- We're getting out.

595
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:10,957
- But...
- Don't argue. We're getting out.

596
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,790
- In spite of our instructions?
- In spite of everything.

597
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:17,499
Do you think I’ll wait on some murdering
swine to get at me? Start packing.

598
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:20,915
Longbarrow, go down to the shipping
office and book the passages.

599
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:23,040
- Yes, sir.
- What about Paul and Claire?

600
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:26,165
- Longbarrow can book for them, too.
- Immediately.

601
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,790
- Mr Preston?
- Yes?

602
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:33,374
- What about me, sir?
- What about you?

603
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,457
Are you going to take me with you, sir?

604
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:40,874
All right. You can book a passage
for yourself as well.

605
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,624
Thank you, Mr Preston. I shall be very
glad to leave under the circumstances.

606
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:50,415
Also, it will be nice to see
the shady lanes, the old country again.

607
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:54,124
It’s been a very long time for me,
Mr Preston.

608
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:57,874
I... I must thank you
for your kindness in taking me.

609
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,165
- For heaven's sake, get out!
- Yes, sir.

610
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:03,499
Longbarrow,
there's no need to come back.

611
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:05,457
I’ll meet you down at the landing stage.

612
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:07,957
If we are lucky,
we can ship out immediately.

613
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:11,749
Barbara, tell Paul and the girl.
We must all leave here separately.

614
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,082
What about my few little things, sir?

615
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,540
- I’ll send your luggage on after you.
- Thank you, Mr Preston.

616
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:20,874
I told you to start packing.

617
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,124
I’m not going. Not until I know that
Paul and Claire are coming with us.

618
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,874
They can please themselves!

619
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:34,374
(Distant chanting of prayer)

620
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:43,624
Oh, Mr Longbarrow!

621
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:47,165
You must excuse me, Mr Paul.
I’m on an urgent errand for your father.

622
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:50,249
- What is it?
- Strictly between ourselves, sir...

623
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:51,832
Yes?

624
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:54,332
We're going back to England. All of us.

625
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:57,457
I’m so excited,
I...I can't stop trembling.

626
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,999
But we must be most discreet.
I’m just going to book the passages.

627
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,124
- No, not for me.
- Not, sir?

628
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:06,165
- Don't book a passage for me.
- Why not, sir?

629
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:08,749
Nor for Claire. Do you understand?

630
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,499
Oh, yes, sir.

631
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:18,082
I thought he'd do something like this.

632
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,499
- I’m going to have a word with him.
- I’ll be back in a moment.

633
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:37,707
- Father, I’ve just seen Longbarrow.
- What about Longbarrow?

634
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,790
I’ve told him not to book a passage
for myself or Claire.

635
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:44,915
That's your business. Your mother's
staying, too. You're in good company.

636
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:47,832
We're not doing ourselves any good
by running away.

637
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:49,957
What do you mean?

638
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:55,499
Someone or...or something
is trying to destroy us.

639
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,832
I believe it will find us wherever we go.

640
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:02,290
What do you mean by "something"?
We're dealing with a maniac.

641
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:04,749
Once we're out of this country,
we're free.

642
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:07,124
Do you honestly believe that?

643
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:11,457
Are you suggesting these murders
have something to do with the tomb?

644
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:14,582
I don't know.
Even the police are baffled.

645
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:17,874
But incredible as it may seem,
it's all we've got to work on.

646
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,374
You must be out of your mind.
You and your mother.

647
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,165
You're a fine pair, I must say!

648
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:27,040
Very well, Paul. Do what you like.

649
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:37,249
(Distant shouting and arguing)

650
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,582
My keys, please.

651
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,707
(Telephone rings)

652
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:13,124
Yes, Mr Preston. Very good, Mr Preston.

653
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,665
It’s no good.
He's still determined to leave.

654
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:20,457
It’s too late. I’ve just seen Inspector
Barrani talk to Longbarrow and I think...

655
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:22,915
Mr Longbarrow has
reluctantly informed me

656
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:25,374
that members of your party
intend to leave.

657
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:29,165
- Does this include yourselves?
- No, Inspector.

658
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:32,665
Your father perhaps?

659
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:37,832
- Inspector...
- One moment, please, Mr Preston.

660
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:40,457
I’m sorry.
The police have been asking me...

661
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:43,665
- You remember my instructions?
- Yes, I remember.

662
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:48,457
- May I have a word with you, Inspector?
- Certainly.

663
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:50,582
In private, please.

664
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:56,040
Look, Inspector,
with the greatest respect,

665
01:06:56,166 --> 01:07:00,707
don't you think your insistence on keeping
us here may be endangering all our lives?

666
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:04,374
I have not yet come
to that conclusion, Mr Preston.

667
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,790
Two of your party
have been murdered.

668
01:07:06,916 --> 01:07:09,790
I see no reason to suppose
there will be a third.

669
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:14,457
- Then what's the point in making us stay?
- I told you the point yesterday.

670
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:18,165
If I did not make it clear then,
I see no purpose in repeating it now.

671
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:21,790
Inspector, before leaving here,

672
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:26,915
I had every intention of writing out
a cheque for, say, £10,000?

673
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:31,249
If you will do me the honour of accepting
it, I will hand it to you personally

674
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:35,915
to be paid, at your discretion,
of course, to some good cause.

675
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:39,374
You are very persistent,
aren't you, Mr Preston?

676
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:43,290
- Don't for a moment see this as a bribe.
- I am trying very hard not to.

677
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:46,082
Think of it merely
as a gesture of goodwill.

678
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:48,707
Now, what do you say, Inspector?

679
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:53,040
Mr Preston, I think you must
begin to understand me.

680
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:55,499
I am not the hospital superintendent.

681
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:58,415
I must insist on your word

682
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:02,374
that none of you will attempt to
leave here until I give you permission.

683
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,499
Do I have your word?

684
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:06,957
- Very well.
- I will accept that.

685
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:10,832
I shall also want to interview you
later today.

686
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:14,540
Please be good enough to remain
in the hotel until I send for you.

687
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:26,415
- Longbarrow!
- Yes, Mr Preston.

688
01:08:30,333 --> 01:08:32,457
- Damn, damn, damn.
- What happened?

689
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:35,415
I was prevented from leaving
by that blasted policeman!

690
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:38,540
- I’m sorry.
- Why do you say that?

691
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:41,290
I only mean I’m sorry
you didn't get your own way.

692
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:43,874
I know how you suffer
when this happens to you.

693
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,249
You must think I’ve let you down,
but they kept on firing questions at me.

694
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:51,874
And I lost my head. I’m not very good
at subterfuge, Mr Preston.

695
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,957
I’m wondering what you ARE good at.

696
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:57,707
I’ll give you one last chance
to prove you're not such an idiot.

697
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:01,374
Go down to that shipping office
and book me one passage, first boat out.

698
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,915
- We have been told very definitely...
- I know what we've been told.

699
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:08,457
Just do as I say. If you come back
without that booking, you're fired.

700
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:10,582
- Do you want me to go now, sir?
- No.

701
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:13,082
How late does the shipping office
stay open?

702
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:17,040
- Until eight o'clock.
- Go at 7.30. It should be dark by then.

703
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:20,790
If the police are watching the hotel,
slip out by the rear entrance.

704
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:23,874
Yes. It will be dark by then. I’ll...

705
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:27,249
Yes?

706
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:30,540
No, Mr Preston, I’ll talk to you later
when I get back.

707
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:34,832
Are you no longer going
to take me with you, sir?

708
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:36,624
No.

709
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:39,415
Oh.

710
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,290
Well, I...

711
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:49,374
I can't pretend that I’m not disappointed,
but I’m sure you know best.

712
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,915
If there is a ship
first thing in the morning,

713
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:58,207
they like the passengers
to be on board by midnight, sir.

714
01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:02,540
Very well. Telephone me
as soon as you've booked the passage.

715
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:04,499
Yes, sir.

716
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:13,082
Why are you looking at me like that?

717
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:17,374
- I’m sorry. How was I looking at you?
- Accusingly.

718
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:22,040
What is there to accuse you of?
Is it your conscience?

719
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:25,999
No, I wasn't looking at you
in any particular way.

720
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:30,665
I was only wondering what it feels like
to have bought everything,

721
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:34,124
except the freedom
to come and go as you please.

722
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,249
And the ability to conquer fear.

723
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,624
Are you trying to frighten me?

724
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:43,165
I don't have to. And I’m sorry.

725
01:10:43,291 --> 01:10:45,290
I really am sorry.

726
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:55,249
You will be returning to the hotel,
Mr Preston?

727
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,957
Yes, Inspector.

728
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:59,332
I presume you will wish to take charge

729
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:02,999
of Mr Newton's personal effects,
what remains of them?

730
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:05,332
- Yes, please.
- I will return them to you

731
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:08,999
as soon as I have had the opportunity
of examining them.

732
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:11,082
Inspector, have you any...?

733
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:14,207
I have no more idea than you,
Mr Preston.

734
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:17,457
No more and perhaps no less.

735
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,499
(Snoring)

736
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,457
(Alarm goes off)

737
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:42,957
Where...where's my glasses?

738
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:48,874
Where are they then?

739
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,874
(Loud snap)

740
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,874
Oh, dear!

741
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:58,832
Oh...

742
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:02,249
Oh, what a terrible thing to do!

743
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:05,999
Oh, dear!

744
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:08,624
I... Oh!

745
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,040
Oh, oh... Oh, dear.

746
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,624
Oh, my... Oh...

747
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,499
I’ll get those damn tickets!

748
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:27,415
I won't forget them.

749
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:31,915
Certainly not.

750
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,332
Excuse me. I’m...

751
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,082
Aaaargh!

752
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:57,957
Help me! Help me, somebody!

753
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,999
Help me!

754
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:03,665
Aaargh!

755
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,457
How long is he going to be?

756
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,957
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- Quite sure.

757
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:25,874
Don't worry about me. I’ll be all right.

758
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,457
I only hope you'll be able to get
to the boat and have a safe journey.

759
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:33,582
Don't forget you have to be
on board by midnight.

760
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,957
(Squawking)

761
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:48,665
- I must go. If I wait any longer...
- I understand.

762
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:55,540
As soon as I get back,
I’ll see about getting you out of here.

763
01:14:55,666 --> 01:14:57,207
Yes.

764
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:00,915
- Well, Barbara...
- Goodbye.

765
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:09,665
- You have sufficient money, I think.
- Yes.

766
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:22,124
- Barbara, I...
- Yes?

767
01:15:23,416 --> 01:15:25,332
Nothing.

768
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:48,665
- Do you want a gharry, effendi?
- There doesn't seem to be any about.

769
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:51,332
- Can you get me one?
- Yes, my brother drives a gharry.

770
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:55,415
He lives only two minutes from here.
I’ll get him for you, effendi. You wait.

771
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:59,040
I have to get to the landing stage.
I’ll give him £10 if he hurries.

772
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:03,290
I don't think my brother would accept 10.
He would want £20, effendi.

773
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:05,624
£20? Daylight robbery!

774
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,832
It is night time.
My brother does not like to work at night.

775
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:12,999
He has three wives who keep him
very busy. Did you say £20, effendi?

776
01:17:13,125 --> 01:17:16,124
It can't be more than two miles,
the landing stage.

777
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,124
Oh, all right. £5 now,
the rest when he gets me to the boat.

778
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,874
Tell him to hurry.
I have to be on board by midnight.

779
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,999
Very good, effendi.

780
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:30,999
(Distant horn blows)

781
01:17:38,416 --> 01:17:40,415
(Horn blows)

782
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:48,124
(Squawks)

783
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,874
(Speaks in ancient language)

784
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,249
(Continues in ancient language)

785
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:44,124
(Chuckles to herself)

786
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:54,874
(Clatter of hooves approaching)

787
01:19:03,791 --> 01:19:06,207
(Sound becomes more distant)

788
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:15,915
(Loud miaow)

789
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:18,249
Aargh!

790
01:19:19,916 --> 01:19:22,540
Aaargh!

791
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:40,415
No gharry, effendi.

792
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:52,249
As a police officer,
I can answer only to logic.

793
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:58,582
But as a man, I admit to many things
which are beyond my comprehension.

794
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,249
Do you mean supernatural things?

795
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:04,374
Perhaps. Who can tell?

796
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:08,040
Some people have seen ghosts,
so they say.

797
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:11,457
It has never been proved
that there are such things,

798
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:14,415
yet who can positively deny
their existence?

799
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:21,040
Some people believe in a blessing
from a priest or a curse from a witch.

800
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:24,124
Do you?

801
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,832
Yes.

802
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,249
We in Egypt have known
many tragedies

803
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:31,374
which have been attributed
for want of a logical cause

804
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,499
to the curse of the Pharaohs.

805
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:37,332
It is impossible for me
to disbelieve in these things.

806
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:41,290
There are now four dead people who are
beginning to gnaw at my conscience

807
01:20:41,416 --> 01:20:44,415
and each of them entered
the tomb of Kah-to-Bey.

808
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:47,415
You three are the only ones left alive

809
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:50,207
and two of you entered the tomb
like the others.

810
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:54,082
I have no desire to risk your lives.
You are free to leave Mezzara.

811
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:58,415
I will say goodbye.

812
01:20:58,541 --> 01:21:00,707
And may Allah go with you.

813
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:09,707
May I advise you as a friend to embark
at the earliest possible moment.

814
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:15,040
Well, Paul?

815
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:19,415
Running away isn't the answer.

816
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,499
I still believe that.

817
01:21:27,416 --> 01:21:29,707
The sacred words of life and death.

818
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:34,707
Somewhere there must be a connection

819
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:38,332
between these words
and the spirit of the tomb.

820
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:42,290
There was also the keeper of the tomb,
this madman. What was he called?

821
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:44,290
Hasmid Ali.

822
01:21:44,416 --> 01:21:46,790
Yes, he threatened us.

823
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:51,915
He warned us what would happen if
we disturbed the Prince's resting place.

824
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:55,957
According to Ancient Egyptology,
the keeper of the tomb has the power

825
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:58,790
to summon up the great spirit
to enact vengeance.

826
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:00,915
Who is the great spirit?

827
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:06,999
I think I know. Claire!

828
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:09,832
Claire!

829
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,624
When she comes back, keep her here.
Don't let her out of your sight.

830
01:22:21,666 --> 01:22:23,624
(Squawking)

831
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:30,582
Oh, come in, come in.

832
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:33,999
Do not be afraid. Come in.

833
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:35,624
Come.

834
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:42,540
Sit down, please.

835
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:52,832
Some terrible things have
happened to friends of mine.

836
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:58,332
I want to know why they have happened
and who is responsible. Can you help me?

837
01:23:03,791 --> 01:23:07,415
Four of your friends...have died.

838
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:11,374
- Yes.
- You want to know why?

839
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,999
Yes.

840
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:17,457
The crystal tells me

841
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:21,540
they have desecrated
the tomb of Kah-to-Bey.

842
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:24,624
- You wish to know more?
- Yes.

843
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,832
There are two other people.

844
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:33,749
You are one of them.

845
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:37,499
I entered the tomb.

846
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:41,040
I see in the crystal...

847
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:45,290
Yes, tell me.

848
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:48,290
It is too horrible.

849
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:51,249
You mean I’m going to die?

850
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,749
In a few minutes from now!

851
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:58,040
(Haiti laughs)

852
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:04,749
If you listen to me,
I may be able to save you.

853
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:09,207
But sit down first.

854
01:25:01,791 --> 01:25:03,790
(Speaks in ancient language)

855
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:11,999
Those are the sacred words of death.

856
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,124
The ones you were afraid to utter.

857
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:20,165
How can these words have had
such power over the spirit of the tomb?

858
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:25,290
Go to the restoration house
and you will find the answer.

859
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:31,665
But first you will confront
the mummy of the slave Prem.

860
01:25:32,916 --> 01:25:37,374
You will ask his forgiveness
for what you have done.

861
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,082
You will say to him...

862
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,207
"Oh, noble Prem,
sacred spirit of the tomb,

863
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:50,040
"I pray your forgiveness

864
01:25:50,166 --> 01:25:54,915
"for my transgressions
against Kah-to-Bey

865
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:58,790
"and the desecration
of his resting place

866
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:04,415
"of which I am profoundly guilty."

867
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:12,749
Now say it in the language
of the Pharaohs.

868
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:17,457
(Speaks in ancient language)

869
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:29,040
(Continues in ancient language)

870
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:40,957
(Man replies in ancient language)

871
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:57,624
(Continues shouting)

872
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:00,207
Aaargh!

873
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:03,749
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

874
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:05,124
Claire! The words of death, say them!

875
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:08,957
Say them!
For God's sake, say them!

876
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:11,499
(Speaks in ancient language)

877
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:17,457
Only he who holds the shroud has
the power to destroy.

878
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:28,165
Quick! Take it!

879
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:32,582
Now, say the words!

880
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:35,040
(Speaks in ancient language)
