2
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,136
You're not looking at me, Mike.

3
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,102
You're not looking at me in the eyes.

4
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,906
That's weak.

5
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,406
Only weak people do that.

6
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,852
I could look you in the eye
if I wanted to, Daddy.

7
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,686
I just don't wanna look you in the eye.

8
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,992
I guess you're just a weak person.

9
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,590
You must have got that from your mother.

10
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,468
It probably would have been better for you...

11
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,937
to have been born a girl.

12
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,297
Then we could have named you Michelle.

13
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,677
You see, weakness is more acceptable
in a girl, Michelle.

14
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,044
I'm sorry, I mean, Mike.

15
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,578
I keep forgetting.

16
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,289
Wait a minute.

17
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,353
Why don't I call you Michelle all the time?

18
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:12,463
Then I wouldn't have to be so goddamn
ashamed of you and your weaknesses.

19
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,329
I could think of you as a girl all the time...

20
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:19,428
by your frocks, dresses,
and frilly hats and scarves.

21
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,370
You could be Daddy's little girl.

22
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:26,434
I wouldn't have to be so fucking ashamed
of being seen with you in public, would I?

23
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,948
What do you think of that, Michelle?

24
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,378
Sound like a good idea?

25
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,214
Don't, Daddy.

26
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,089
What?

27
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,087
Did you say something?

28
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,724
Such a soft little girl's voice.
I couldn't hear what you said.

29
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,557
I hate you, Daddy.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,968
- Speak up, girl!
- I hate you!

31
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,200
I hate you, because I love...

32
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,271
It makes me feel...

33
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,778
guilty inside, hate.

34
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,917
I can't let the heart speak.

35
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,310
Then don't speak.

36
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,818
Don't speak to me. Show me.

37
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,892
Don't tell me.
I'm not interested in what little girls say.

38
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,016
Show me!

39
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,561
Show me your anger.
Then I can understand it.

40
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,594
There you are, Daddy.

41
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,571
I see you, Michelle.

42
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,445
I see everything.

43
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,676
This is me, Daddy.

44
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,316
This is what you do to me inside.

45
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,491
Go all the way through it.

46
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,427
Go all the way through it to the end.

47
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,558
Come out the other end.

48
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,800
Don't stop in the middle.

49
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,495
I'm watching you.

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,005
I'm watching everything you do, Mike.

51
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:26,932
Wow.

52
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,130
The man is a genius.

53
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,298
Dr. Raglan would like to thank you all
for coming this afternoon.

54
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,071
I believe your bus is waiting outside now.
Thank you.

55
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,164
Candy...

56
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,196
it's me, honey.

57
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,806
Daddy.

58
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,476
Okay, honey.

59
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,550
Warm enough?

60
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,561
Okay, put the whale down. Turn around.

61
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,400
Hold your hair up.

62
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,975
Oh, my God.

63
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,329
Sorry, Hal...

64
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,407
but Mr. Carveth is still here.

65
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,567
He's starting to get passionate
about the whole thing.

66
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,942
Okay, send him in.

67
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,115
Mr. Carveth.

68
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,984
Thanks a lot.

69
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,280
Frank, it's been some time.

70
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,680
What can I do for you?

71
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,224
I want to see Nola.

72
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,327
I want to see my wife, now.

73
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,428
You know she's still undergoing
intensive therapy.

74
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,824
I can't let you break that isolation.

75
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,230
You let her see Candice
on the weekends, don't you?

76
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,804
Yes, Frank, I do. But that's different.

77
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,638
Visits from her daughter
was in her program from the very start.

78
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,374
Her program has just changed.

79
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,571
What do you mean?

80
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,539
You sound hostile.

81
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,611
My daughter's been beaten severely...

82
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,981
and scratched and bitten!

83
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,283
Her mother did it...

84
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,450
her mother,
who is under your psychiatric care.

85
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,596
That's an incredibly heavy
accusation to make.

86
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,267
Did Candice tell you that?

87
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,471
Candice won't talk about it.

88
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,005
She pretends
the whole thing never happened.

89
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,505
But it was Nola...

90
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,605
or some other crazy
you have stashed away up here.

91
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,048
Either way, no more weekends with Mommy.

92
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,846
The kid stays with me.

93
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,518
To take Candice away from her
at this stage...

94
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,753
could send Nola over into the deep end.

95
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,556
It's a critical time for her.

96
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:56,563
I happen to think that Nola's
been in over her head for a long time now.

97
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,065
You have no legal right to deny access.

98
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,104
Any time you'd like
to test the matter in open court...

99
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,275
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

100
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,815
For the ultimate good
of your own family, Frank...

101
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,251
we'd be prepared to do just that.

102
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,220
But don't you force it.

103
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,991
You bring Candy back to her mother
next weekend. She won't harm her.

104
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,063
There must be some other answer
to what you've seen.

105
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,098
Until you give me that answer...

106
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,801
Candy is not coming back.

107
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,614
Yes, Hal?

108
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,019
Prepare Nola Carveth
for another session tonight, will you?

109
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,091
Sure.

110
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,486
And, Chris...

111
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,559
make it phase two, after supper.

112
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,857
Okay, Hal.

113
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,627
This guy Raglan
is strictly an emotional opportunist.

114
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,900
He's a legit M.D., right?

115
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,999
He's a real psychiatrist.

116
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,836
Yes.

117
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,016
Goddamn it, psychoplasmics is a rip-off.

118
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,111
It's a sideshow. I've seen it in action.

119
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,620
It doesn't matter what you think.
You listen to me.

120
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,763
You call up this Raglan,
and you be a real mensch with him.

121
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:37,230
Otherwise, it's just a matter of time
before the cops show up at your door...

122
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,497
and you lose your kid for good.

123
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,163
The law believes in motherhood.

124
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,506
If I can dig up enough testimony to prove...

125
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:53,278
that Raglan's a dangerous fraud,
that Somafree is crawling with crazies...

126
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,244
it's no place for a kid, any time...

127
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,984
You're getting warmer.

128
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,154
But when Candy doesn't show up
at Somafree next weekend...

129
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,788
your wife can take legal action immediately.

130
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,627
You could find yourself belted with a writ
in seven days.

131
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,166
If I give Nola enough time,
she'll really hurt the kid.

132
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,767
I know she will.

133
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,511
I'll do anything I have to.

134
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,930
Here's your daddy.

135
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,201
I bet he knows all about this zipper.
There we go.

136
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,500
All set, now.

137
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,074
I'd love to talk to you
sometime soon, Mr. Carveth...

138
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,015
about school activities and Candy.

139
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,321
You missed the last open house.

140
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,318
Okay, soon.

141
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:46,798
Thanks.

142
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,228
See you tomorrow, Candy.

143
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,670
Thank you very much, Frank.

144
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,777
- For what?
- For bringing me my grandchild.

145
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,514
I know if it were up to Nola,
I'd never see Candice.

146
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,478
Juliana, that's not true.

147
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:09,449
Nola and I both know how much
she needs her grandma, especially now.

148
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,583
You're sweet.

149
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,727
I guess you know, now, what it feels like.

150
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,955
- What it feels like?
- Being a parent.

151
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,999
Being blamed for everything.

152
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,968
To have the past distorted, so you
don't even recognize yourself anymore.

153
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,508
Your child's version of the past, that is.

154
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,940
Juliana, Candice is only five.

155
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,339
She's working on it right now, believe me.

156
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,184
Thirty seconds after you're born,
you have a past.

157
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,884
And 60 seconds after that,
you start to lie to yourself about it.

158
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,658
I guess I've been indulging in a horrid bout
of nostalgia these last few days.

159
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,864
It must be the weather.
At least now I have a partner in crime.

160
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,539
- I've got to go.
- Of course.

161
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,704
'Bye, Daddy.

162
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,157
Take your time, we'll both be just fine.

163
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,068
I'll be with you in a second, sweetie.

164
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:41,442
I'm just gonna get a refill, and then
we'll look at those lovely old pictures.

165
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,016
Mommy.

166
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,014
Yes, Candice?

167
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,215
Yes, sweetie?

168
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,026
Mommy, you hurt me.

169
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,462
You hit me with your fists,
and then you scratched me with your nails.

170
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,593
You hurt me.

171
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,031
I didn't, sweetie.

172
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,538
You must have had a bad dream.

173
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,808
Mommies don't do that.
Mommies don't hurt their own children.

174
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,504
They don't?

175
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,342
They never do?

176
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,656
They sometimes do.

177
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,786
Sometimes, but then they're bad mommies,
they're fucked-up mommies.

178
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,492
Like whose?

179
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,167
Like whose mommy?

180
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,869
Like mine was.

181
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,411
Fucked up and bad.

182
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,282
No, I'm not, Nola.

183
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,816
You're being so unfair, sweetheart.
Mommies never do that.

184
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,555
Mommies never hurt their own children.

185
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,892
You did hurt me.

186
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,923
You beat me and you scratched me.

187
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,732
You threw me down the stairs.

188
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,438
Show me what I did.

189
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,567
Don't stop it now, darling, show me.

190
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,275
Show me your anger. Show it to me.

191
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,911
Go all the way through it.

192
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,878
Go all the way through it, till the end.

193
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,152
Right to the end.

194
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,395
That one's my favorite.

195
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,995
This one's your favorite?

196
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,331
Yes, Mommy in the hospital
when she was a little girl.

197
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,539
That's right. I remember this picture.

198
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,879
Your Grandpa Barton took this picture.

199
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,143
Tell me the rest of the story
that goes with this picture.

200
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,548
Why was Mommy in the hospital so much?

201
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:09,060
Some days, she would wake up
and she would be covered...

202
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,424
with big, ugly bumps.

203
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,590
And the doctors were very worried,
because they could never find out...

204
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,000
what those bumps all over her skin
really were.

205
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,539
I guess I didn't stack the dishes too well.
I better go see what the damage is.

206
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,076
While I'm there,
I think I'll freshen up both our drinks.

207
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:06,965
Jerry.

208
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,857
Hi, Frank.

209
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,633
You're really falling behind on this.

210
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,366
The Brenleys think that they are going to be
moving in here by May.

211
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,973
We're not going to make that, for sure.
Maybe by June.

212
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,242
I heard that the city plumbing permit
got held up...

213
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,508
because of a change in the building code.

214
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,184
Mr. Carveth.

215
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,744
Telephone call for you.

216
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,464
- Hello.
- Is that Mr. Carveth?

217
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,301
- Yes.
- Mr. Frank Carveth?

218
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,703
- This is Frank Carveth.
- This is Sgt. Martel, with 78th Division.

219
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,534
One of our officers noticed
a broken kitchen window...

220
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,271
while on a routine patrol
of the neighborhood.

221
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,177
He found your mother-in-law's body
in the kitchen.

222
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,579
The murder weapon was on the floor,
next to her.

223
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,816
He then found your daughter upstairs,
sound asleep in the bedroom.

224
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,953
It seems she missed the whole thing.

225
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:14,164
- Where is she now? I'd like to see her.
- With our police psychologist, Dr. Birkin.

226
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,725
- Psychologist? Why? Was she hysterical?
- No.

227
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,600
On the contrary, she was very cool
throughout the whole thing.

228
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,805
A little too cool, I thought,
so I asked Dr. Birkin to talk with her.

229
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,980
Just for an opinion.

230
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:34,909
In the meantime, can you think of
the names of any persons...

231
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,814
who would have a motive
to murder this woman?

232
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:42,423
You see, it doesn't seem to me to be
a simple case of an interrupted break-in...

233
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,822
or, say, a rape-murder.

234
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,532
Juliana had a long series of lovers.
I never met any of them.

235
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,798
What about her husband?

236
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,140
His name is Barton Kelly.
He works for the government, out in Halifax.

237
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,308
They were divorced over 10 years ago.

238
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,920
- Dr. Birkin.
- You must be Candice's father.

239
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,749
I'd like to take her home now.

240
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:15,691
Please. Give me just two minutes with you.
It's important. Have a seat.

241
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:23,130
To put it bluntly, I don't think your daughter
escaped this incident entirely unscathed.

242
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,102
- You think she saw what happened?
- I suspect she did.

243
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,140
Or she saw something
which traumatized her, confused her...

244
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,074
disturbed her in some way.

245
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,772
The officer who found her
said that she was very difficult to wake up.

246
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,850
To me, that indicates
a kind of abnormal deep sleep...

247
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,942
which a lot of people,
even children, will use...

248
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,783
to escape something
that's too painful to face.

249
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,924
And she says that she doesn't remember
being brought to her grandmother's...

250
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,790
or seeing her at all.

251
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,797
Do you think she'll remember, eventually?

252
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:57,498
Mr. Carveth, I think you must
encourage her to remember.

253
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,337
Why?

254
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,104
My concern is that the child
could have a very serious breakdown...

255
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,268
if she doesn't come to terms
with what she's experienced.

256
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:10,474
You see, these things tend to
express themselves in one way or another.

257
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,214
I've seen five-year-olds like her...

258
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,843
with ulcers as bad
as any middle-aged businessman.

259
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,979
Okay, I get the picture.

260
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,188
- Now can I take her home?
- I think that's fine.

261
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:23,587
No problem.

262
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,035
You're sure you don't want a story?

263
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,965
You don't have to read, you know.

264
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,172
I can make one up for you.

265
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,813
Do you want to tell me a story...

266
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,516
about what happened today at Grandma's?

267
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,818
You go to sleep, honey.

268
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,296
I'll leave the hall light on.

269
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,345
Damn.

270
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,143
No outside calls. You're in isolation.
You know that.

271
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,982
I tried to reach Dr. Raglan. He hasn't come.

272
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,487
He's on his way.

273
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,259
Chris...

274
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,793
Is something wrong? Anything?

275
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,034
Then it's me again.

276
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,565
Nothing's wrong, except with me.

277
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,209
No, that's Frank talking,
Frank twisting my words.

278
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,839
He won't be patient, he won't trust me,
he won't wait until I get well.

279
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,614
He thinks...

280
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,752
that I'm turning into my mother.

281
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,950
Day by day, moment by moment,
he thinks that I'm trying...

282
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,651
to make Candy into Baby Nola.

283
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,291
Is he right?

284
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,358
No. That's the last thing on earth I'd...

285
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,369
Who's that?

286
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,643
It's Daddy.

287
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,850
Frank hates me, Daddy. He despises me.

288
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,190
He thinks I'm trying to harm my little girl...

289
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,389
and I know that he's thinking of a way
to take her away.

290
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,293
And that's very unfair of him.
That's very arrogant of him.

291
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,098
You mustn't be too hard on him,
Nola, sweetheart.

292
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,069
He's just trying to be a good,
protective father.

293
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,400
No.

294
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:26,935
Yes.

295
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,143
He's just doing
what a good father should do.

296
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,350
He's protecting his little girl.

297
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,681
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
He doesn't want to see her hurt.

298
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,280
He doesn't want to see her hurt by anybody,
not even her own mother.

299
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,293
Now, is there anything wrong with that?

300
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,397
No.

301
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,096
No, there isn't.

302
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,072
After all, it's just what I did for you, isn't it?

303
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,007
Frank's protecting Candy
the same way as I protected you, isn't he?

304
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,349
Isn't he?

305
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:07,885
No.

306
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,514
What do you mean, "no"?

307
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,151
- What do mean when you say "no"?
- I love you, Daddy.

308
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,228
I don't want you to think
that I don't love you.

309
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,161
I mean, you didn't.

310
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:28,963
"Didn't"?

311
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,435
"Didn't" what?

312
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,903
You didn't protect me.

313
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:37,907
You didn't.

314
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,975
You didn't, and you should have.

315
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,995
You shouldn't have looked away
when she hit me.

316
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,436
And you shouldn't have walked away
from the table...

317
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:03,064
when she twisted my words.
You should have stopped her.

318
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,810
You should have hit her when she hit me!

319
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,907
And you should have smacked her
when she smacked me.

320
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:15,781
Oh, God, I love you.

321
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,154
But you didn't protect me.

322
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,361
And you should have.

323
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,227
You pretended it wasn't happening.

324
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,626
You looked away.

325
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,069
And you should have.

326
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,104
Why didn't you?

327
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,769
Didn't you love me?

328
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,457
Look, there he is.

329
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,056
There's your grandfather.

330
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,088
Barton.

331
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,425
Hello, Frank. How you doing?
Good to see you.

332
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,434
- Let me take that.
- Hello. How you doing, Candy?

333
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,467
I guess you don't remember
your old granddad?

334
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,473
Right this way.

335
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:48,473
You didn't have to come way out here.
We could have met later, at the hotel.

336
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,071
I just didn't like the idea
of you coming in alone.

337
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,877
How long you plan to stay in town?

338
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,612
I guess we could
have the funeral tomorrow...

339
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,651
but Juliana's parents
might want to come in from Arizona.

340
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:02,783
Then there's that sister in Vancouver.
I don't know just how it's going to work out.

341
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,920
- All right. What hotel are you staying in?
- Park Plaza.

342
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,160
You know, I was even thinking
about going out to that old house again.

343
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,026
I still have the key, after all these years.

344
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:17,407
Juliana used to make a big fuss
about never having changed the locks.

345
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,867
I could never understand why.

346
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,940
Maybe it's because she really couldn't admit
that we were finished.

347
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,616
When I think about you and Nola...

348
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,278
and this sweet child having to go through
the same heartaches we went through...

349
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,187
it's enough to make you cry.

350
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,291
Yes, it is.

351
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,767
I'm here to see Mr. Jan Hartog.

352
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,988
Come in. Right in.

353
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,963
Sit down. I'll be right there.

354
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,934
Sit down. I'll be there in a second.

355
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,409
Goddamn son of a bitch.

356
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,682
Okay.

357
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,802
That's my...

358
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,674
heart, over there on the floor.

359
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,437
- Your heart?
- My second heart.

360
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:39,639
Your first heart
makes your blood circulate, right?

361
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,948
But what about your lymphatic fluids?

362
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,449
I don't know.

363
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:50,055
Movement, walking and running, fucking,
rolling on the floor, anything.

364
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,188
People have this whole other system
they don't even know about.

365
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,823
The lymphatic system,
it's like the blood system...

366
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:01,871
with its own style of veins and arteries...

367
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,937
but no heart.

368
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,571
You have to keep moving
to get it to circulate.

369
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:13,380
And they've just given me pills.
They do that every day.

370
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,711
And I've got to move them
through the lymphatic system.

371
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,987
Goddamn it.

372
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,490
Pardon my sweat.

373
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,600
I'm gonna take a bath, real soon.

374
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,100
So, Mr. Carveth...

375
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,975
how did you get my name?

376
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,206
My lawyer knows your lawyer.

377
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,179
I see. I get it.

378
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,775
Is your lawyer
preparing a case against Raglan, too?

379
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:50,851
Basically, yes.

380
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,855
- Slightly different from yours.
- How different?

381
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,929
My wife is still in therapy with Raglan.

382
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,262
I'm claiming psychological damage,
not physiological.

383
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,667
I see. Give him some more time
with your wife...

384
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,232
and you'll be able to claim
physiological damage, too.

385
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,475
Wouldn't this look impressive in court?

386
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,440
Do you like it? I do.

387
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,347
That's Raglan. That's psychoplasmics...

388
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,283
and it's called lymphosarcoma.

389
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,228
And it's spreading.

390
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,291
It's a form of cancer
of the lymphatic system.

391
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,730
You blame Raglan for that?

392
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,336
Raglan did it.

393
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,971
Raglan encouraged my body...

394
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,470
to revolt against me.

395
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:50,774
And it did.

396
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,913
I have a small revolution on my hands...

397
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,249
and I'm not putting it down
very successfully.

398
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:02,517
Then your lawyer really thinks
he can prove Raglan's responsible?

399
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:06,094
Are you kidding me?
You can't prove something like that in court.

400
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:09,758
Right from square one,
you're into, what, metaphysics?

401
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,364
How do you know
I'm not going to get cancer at age 32...

402
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:19,000
whether I'd gone into
psychoplasmics therapy or not?

403
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,809
No, we'd get laughed out of court.

404
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,182
Then why are you going into court?

405
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,582
Revenge.

406
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,719
Even if we lose, people will get nervous
about psychoplasmics.

407
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,057
It will be bad publicity.

408
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,825
They won't even remember
whether we won or lost.

409
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,130
They'll just remember the slogan:

410
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,431
"Psychoplasmics can cause cancer."

411
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,639
Catchy.

412
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,475
Is that going to help?

413
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,553
Maybe.

414
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,479
I'm not alone.

415
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,150
I'm in touch with a lot of people
who did psychoplasmics.

416
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,856
We might form a club.

417
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,193
I want to help you.

418
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,095
Okay. Thanks.

419
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,754
Dr. Raglan?

420
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,630
Yes?

421
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,090
I'm Barton Kelly, Nola Carveth's father.

422
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,633
Glad to meet you.

423
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,570
I'm sorry to accost you like this...

424
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,506
but your receptionist wasn't too helpful.

425
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,410
She probably knew I was on my way to...

426
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,504
Did you know
that Nola's mother died yesterday?

427
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,082
That she was murdered?

428
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,343
Yes, the police spoke to me.

429
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,683
- Then you've told her.
- No, I haven't.

430
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,958
That's why I'm here, to tell her.

431
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,996
Mr. Kelly, your wife's death
was a tragic and shocking thing.

432
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,628
That's why Nola must not be told.

433
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,102
What?

434
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,167
Nola's going through a very critical stage
in her therapy.

435
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,374
I'm not sure she could take it.

436
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,773
Are you saying that
I'm just supposed to bury the girl's mother...

437
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,575
and not tell her about it?

438
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,749
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

439
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:46,080
You are one ignorant son of a bitch,
Dr. Raglan.

440
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,422
Now, I have left my phone number...

441
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,924
on your front desk.

442
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,299
If I don't hear from my daughter
by tomorrow afternoon...

443
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,099
I'm coming back up here to get her.

444
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,809
Shall I have him stopped?

445
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,949
No, it's all right.

446
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,777
He's drunk.

447
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,230
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

448
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,361
- You two look like you're having fun.
- We were.

449
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,065
Daddy, Ms. Mayer said she was starving.

450
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,604
Can we feed her at our place tonight?

451
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,675
Candy...

452
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,171
We could if she wanted to.

453
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,745
What do you think?

454
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,475
Well, I...

455
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,348
We could talk after Candy goes to bed.

456
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:25,922
Sure.

457
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,123
As soon as Candy realized
she had me alone...

458
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,928
she got me to play
"mother and daughter" with her.

459
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,002
She obviously needs mothering,
and isn't getting it.

460
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,474
Sometimes it just kills me to think
I might have screwed my kid up already.

461
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,576
She's not even six.

462
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,807
It's not just you.

463
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,219
Sometimes when I'm being easy on myself,
I say, "It's not your fault.

464
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,791
"You got taken in.

465
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,385
"You got involved with a woman
who married you for your sanity...

466
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,191
"hoping it would rub off."

467
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,768
Instead, it started to work the other way.

468
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,112
Hello?

469
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,108
It's Barton Kelly, Frank.

470
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,676
How are you?

471
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,174
Just mediocre.

472
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,011
How are you?

473
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,282
I made a mistake.

474
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,955
I came back to the old place.

475
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,458
It's got me.

476
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,293
I'm depressed as hell.

477
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,665
Barton, get in a cab, will you?

478
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,601
- Just tell him to take...
- That's not all.

479
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,804
There's Nola, too.

480
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,508
How do you mean?

481
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,171
I went up to that place to see her.

482
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,348
They wouldn't even let me talk to her.

483
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,952
They said no to me, her own father!

484
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,020
Jesus.

485
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,049
So I'm going back up there, to Somafree.

486
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,351
We'll leave just as soon as you get here.

487
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,519
Soon as I get there?

488
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,290
I'll be waiting for you.

489
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,661
I know you'll want to go up there with me.

490
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,493
- You're not far from here, are you?
- Barton, listen to me.

491
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,231
I don't think that's a very smart thing to do.

492
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,137
I'm doing it, with or without you.

493
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,170
Okay.

494
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:31,374
I'm only about 15 minutes away. Wait for me.

495
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:32,710
I'll be there.

496
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,978
You're a good lad.

497
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,951
We'll go up there together,
and kick their ass.

498
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,322
I'm waiting on you.

499
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,467
I've a feeling
I've just been recruited to baby-sit.

500
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,098
Would you? It'd take 45 minutes.

501
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,068
He's drunk.

502
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,702
He'll drive his car off a bridge,
unless I talk some sense into him.

503
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,074
45 minutes?

504
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,738
That's all it'll take.

505
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,182
Okay.

506
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,517
Thanks.

507
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,452
Help yourself to some coffee.

508
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:12,656
Here.

509
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,222
Look at this while I'm gone.

510
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,654
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

511
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,127
45 minutes.

512
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,007
I shouldn't have...

513
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:25,276
I never planned it to be this way.

514
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,061
