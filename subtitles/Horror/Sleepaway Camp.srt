00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,351
Of course he drowned.
He was horsing around, the canoe tipped over.

465
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,977
He must have hit his head.

466
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,772
I don't think so.
Weren't any bumps or bruises when I checked.

00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,774
Though again,
I'm no expert on this matter.

468
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,653
It was obviously an accident.
I mean, the boy might have gotten scared and panicked.

469
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,487
Right?

470
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,280
That could be a logical explanation.

471
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,200
So it was one of those fluke accidents
we could not have foreseen,

the officer said, right?

I said the autopsy will
be more conclusive.

Okay, let me have your

The last few days we've been using

play capture the flag.

you're going to be wearing white strips

or blue strips. The guys with the blue
strips have to capture the white flag,

have to capture the blue flag.

sneak into the other guy's territory.

Capture his flag without getting
one of your strips taken off.
