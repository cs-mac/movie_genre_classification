1
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,470
What are you doing here?

2
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,763
Who are you?

3
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,143
I am Baron Latos.

4
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,095
I have come to you for help.

5
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,476
It's 5:00 in the morning!

6
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,024
I must apologize for the intrusion,

7
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,855
but travel for me is very difficult
and I've come a long way.

8
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,530
I don't understand.

9
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,404
Perhaps you will after you've led me
to the basement room of this castle.

10
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,495
Very strange request.

11
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,662
This is my home.

12
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,331
Have no fear, Doctor.

13
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,957
Had conditions permitted, I would have
presented myself in the usual manner.

14
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,922
Well, it is most unusual.

15
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,750
I'll explain everything before sunrise.

16
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,719
Dr. Edelmann, do you believe
in the immortality of the soul?

17
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,395
Naturally, being a religious man.

18
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,063
Of the body?

19
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,107
Medical science refutes such a thing.

20
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,402
Just as it denies
the existence of vampirism.

21
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,902
It doesn't deny
certain physical aspects of it.

22
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,404
Cases have been recorded
in which the victims,

23
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,577
driven by some abnormal urge,

24
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:00,161
actually believed the blood of other people
was necessary to keep them alive,

25
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,585
became psychopathic killers
in order to obtain it.

26
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,465
These beliefs probably
upset their metabolisms,

27
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,589
induced fixations, lustful appetites.

28
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,884
Of course, the whole thing
is of a highly speculative nature,

29
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,715
particularly the supernatural aspect.

30
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,971
Do you doubt the supernatural?

31
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,689
I find it difficult to believe that a human
being can change himself into a bat,

32
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:29,190
or that by feeding upon the blood
of the living he can obtain eternal life.

33
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,283
But what has this discussion
to do with us, Baron Latos?

34
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,485
Perhaps a great deal, Doctor.

35
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,615
Shall we proceed?

36
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,384
The Dracula crest.

37
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,468
Yes, Doctor.

38
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,562
I am Count Dracula.

39
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,104
But I'm known to the outside world
as Baron Latos.

40
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,487
You see before you a man
who lived for centuries,

41
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,441
kept alive by the blood
of innocent people.

42
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,156
You ask me to believe that?

43
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,203
That's why I've come to you.

44
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,157
To seek release from a curse
of misery and horror

45
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,289
against which I am
powerless to fight alone.

46
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:30,918
According to the legend, a vampire
must return to his grave before sunup.

47
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,422
If you remain here,
how would that be possible?

48
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:43,469
Within this coffin is a layer
of soil taken from my native country.

49
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,434
That earth makes this my grave,

50
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,484
in which I must lie helpless
during the daylight hour.

51
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:56,272
Because a single ray of sunlight falling
on the vampire would destroy him.

52
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,774
Yes, Doctor.

53
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,158
The door was locked.

54
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,455
How did you get that in here?

55
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:10,166
Since you doubt the supernatural,
let us say that you were mistaken.

56
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,497
The outer door was not locked.

57
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,883
You're taking a great deal
for granted, Baron.

58
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,212
Proceeding on the assumption
that I would take your case.

59
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,465
Your reputation for helping others
made me certain that you would.

60
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,259
You could affect a cure?

61
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,477
There might be a way,
despite the dangers involved.

62
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,901
It would be a challenge
to medical science.

63
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,104
Accept that challenge, Doctor.

64
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,731
But decide quickly.

65
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,155
The dawn.

66
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,498
- Good morning, Nina.
- Good morning, Doctor.

67
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,130
Make a blood smear of this for me,
will you, please?

68
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,676
A Baron Latos will be in this evening.

69
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,678
I'll see him immediately.

70
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,431
Well, how are things coming?

71
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,934
Splendid, Doctor.

72
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,892
Increasing the humidity was a good idea.

73
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,147
The spores are multiplying
faster than ever.

74
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,520
Yes, we're making progress, all right.

75
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,198
Oh, the operation on
Johannes' leg proves that.

76
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,860
If we can produce the mold in quantity,

77
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,414
think what it will mean to thousands
of people all over the world.

78
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,957
We'll succeed, Nina.

79
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,457
And when we do, your devotion
to this experiment will be rewarded.

80
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,581
You'll be the first to benefit by it.

81
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,731
Nina?

82
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,992
Make a culture of this and prepare
an antitoxin as soon as possible.

83
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,444
All right, Doctor.

84
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,449
I am Baron Latos.

85
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,624
Dr. Edelmann is expecting me.

86
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,544
Baron Latos.

87
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,091
Miss Morelle?

88
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,919
What a pleasant surprise.

89
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,879
It's good to see you again, Baron.

90
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,636
You left Schvonheim just as
we were becoming acquainted.

91
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,811
I could hardly refuse the opportunity
to become Dr. Edelmann's assistant.

92
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:16,223
Now that chance has brought us together
again, I hope to see you quite often.

93
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,396
I've taken a chateau close by.

94
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,068
You're not here as a patient.

95
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,990
Unfortunately, the Doctor thought it
advisable that I come here for treatment.

96
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,571
Good evening, Baron. Come in.

97
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,573
Miss Morelle, it will be
necessary for Baron Latos

98
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,245
to have his appointments
during the evenings.

99
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,698
Yes, Doctor.

100
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,919
Sit down, Baron.

101
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,496
Thank you.

102
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,333
It appears that I may have
to alter my theories.

103
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,887
An examination of your blood reveals
the presence of a peculiar parasite.

104
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,345
A form with which
I'm completely unfamiliar.

105
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,305
It's possible that it may have something
to do with your problem.

106
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,099
Proceeding on the assumption that it has,

107
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,777
I'm having an antitoxin
prepared so that we can see.

108
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,689
Your new theory being...

109
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,952
That a pure culture of a parasite,
introduced into the parent bloodstream,

110
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,952
will destroy not only its own kind,
but themselves as well.

111
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,783
Sounds very promising.

112
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,992
Perhaps.

113
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,078
But we must proceed slowly.

114
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,499
These treatments will take some time?

115
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,542
Without doubt.

116
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,137
Meanwhile, your visits here
should be only at intervals.

117
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,508
On the nights and at the hours
which I shall designate.

118
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,388
Is that understood?

119
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,018
Quite clearly.

120
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,480
Then we shall start treatments tonight.

121
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,057
The transfusion.

122
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,730
How long will the Doctor be busy?

123
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,941
Some little time, I'm afraid.

124
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,201
I'm must see him at once.
I've come a long way.

125
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,825
If you'll just give him my name.

126
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,326
Talbot.

127
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,325
Lawrence Talbot.

128
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,586
Maybe he'll understand.

129
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,289
I can't interrupt the Doctor now.

130
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,374
He's giving a transfusion.

131
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,673
How long will that take?

132
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,554
Hour. Maybe longer.

133
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,182
I'm sorry, you'll just have to wait.

134
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,763
I can't wait!

135
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,599
There isn't time.

136
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,980
There isn't time!

137
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,997
Your next appointment
will be Thursday evening, Baron.

138
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,873
At about the same time?

139
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,003
Yes.

140
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,254
Good night, Doctor.

141
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,506
Good night.

142
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,713
Good night.

143
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,298
Good night.

144
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,313
Oh!

145
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,650
Baron.

146
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,998
Mr. Talbot was here to see you, Doctor.

147
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,045
- He was terribly upset.
- "Talbot"?

148
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,463
Lawrence Talbot.

149
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,542
He seemed to think
you'd recognize the name.

150
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,753
"Lawrence Talbot." No.

151
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,089
There was something tragic about him.

152
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,267
He had the look of
a man tormented by fear.

153
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,933
When I told him you were busy, he rushed
out of the house saying he couldn't wait,

154
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,605
there wasn't time.

155
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,776
Well, perhaps he'll come back.

156
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,649
Hello.

157
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,781
Just a moment, please.

158
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,578
It's Inspector Holtz.

159
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,620
Yes, Inspector?

160
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,744
Oh!

161
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,380
Very well, I'll be right down.

162
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,380
You'd better come along with me, Miliza.

163
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,641
Go to your homes, all of you.

164
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,476
This is no concern of yours.

165
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,482
We don't have to go home.

166
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,983
We know our rights.

167
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,780
That goes for you too, Steinmuhl.

168
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,575
Whenever there's trouble,
you're always on the front line.

169
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,114
Oh, good evening, Doctor.

170
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,661
Come right in, will you?

171
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,784
Go home!

172
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,833
If I find the person who started
the rumor we have a crazy man here,

173
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,954
I'll lock him up.

174
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,921
As a matter of fact, Doctor, we have.

175
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,207
He came in here a little while ago
and demanded that I put him in a cell.

176
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,507
To keep him from committing
murder, he said.

177
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,588
I did it to humor him.

178
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,344
But when he started raving,

179
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,559
I realized we had something serious
on our hands and sent for you.

180
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,728
Decent sort of chap, otherwise.

181
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,680
- Name of Talbot.
- Talbot?

182
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,358
You remember, Doctor.
The young man I told you about.

183
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,231
Come in, Doctor. He's in here.

184
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,614
Who are these people?

185
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,411
Get them out of here!

186
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,740
I didn't come here to
be put on exhibition.

187
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,790
Come, come now. Take it easy.

188
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,168
This is Dr. Edelmann.

189
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,087
He's come to help you.

190
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,543
Dr. Edelmann!

191
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,171
Yes. You wanted to see me?

192
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,463
That's why I came to Visaria.

193
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,052
In the hope that you could help me.

194
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,434
It's too late now.

195
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,888
What seems to be your trouble, my boy?

196
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:55,320
Do you believe that a man
can be transformed into an animal?

197
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,569
I believe anything can happen
in a person's mind.

198
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,651
This is not in my mind.

199
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,945
Doctor.

200
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,665
Have you ever heard of the pentagram?

201
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,913
The five-pointed star.

202
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,330
The mark of the beast.

203
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,714
When the full moon rises,
I turn into a werewolf,

204
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,008
with only one desire in my mind.

205
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,886
To kill!

206
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,718
Listen to me, Talbot.

207
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,397
There's no such thing as a werewolf.

208
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,477
It's a belief that
exists only in your mind.

209
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,462
Doctor, isn't there something you can do?

210
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,923
Not until morning, when this passes.

211
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,842
Bring him to me then.

212
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,930
Put him in my care,
and I'll do all I can for him.

213
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,402
Oh, I didn't hear you.

214
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,363
The Doctor will see you now.

215
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,827
Do you think he can help me?

216
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,750
He's done some wonderful things.

217
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,620
Then why has he kept me
waiting here all day?

218
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,956
Doesn't he realize that tonight...

219
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,334
Oh, I'm sorry.

220
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,254
I know he'll do whatever he can for me.

221
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,552
Good afternoon, Doctor.

222
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,646
Sit down, Mr. Talbot.

223
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,270
What have you got to tell me?

224
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,147
In your case, my boy,
diagnosis is extremely difficult.

225
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,325
But the examination you made
this morning, the X-rays.

226
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,036
Examination discloses one condition,

227
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,831
pressure upon certain parts of the brain.

228
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,911
This condition coupled with your belief
that the moon can bring about a change

229
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,838
accomplishes exactly that.

230
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,631
During the period in which

231
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:06,302
your reasoning processes
give way to self-hypnosis,

232
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,176
the glands which govern your
metabolism get out of control,

233
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,850
like a steam engine
without a balance wheel.

234
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,891
When this happens, the glands generate
an abnormal supply of certain hormones.

235
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,351
In your case, those which bring about the
physical transformation which you experience.

236
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,607
But explaining it doesn't help.

237
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,571
What can you do about it?

238
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,068
Operate?

239
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:31,782
A surgical operation to enlarge the cranial
cavity is a long and dangerous one.

240
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,614
Then there's nothing
you can do to help me.

241
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,119
There might be.

242
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,745
Come here, my boy.

243
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,705
Under tropical conditions,
which we have tried to duplicate here,

244
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:45,087
this hybrid plant, clavaria formosa,

245
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,920
produces a mold from which
we've been able to distill...

246
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,507
Well, a substance which possesses
the property of softening

247
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,810
any hard structure
composed of calcium salts.

248
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,432
Bone, for instance.

249
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,977
With this medium,
it might be possible without surgery

250
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,778
to reshape the cranial cavity
and thus eliminate the pressure.

251
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,570
You can do that now?

252
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,740
Can you?

253
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:14,404
Unfortunately, it will take some time
to produce mold in sufficient quantity.

254
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,203
Tonight, the moon will be full again.

255
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,460
What can you do to help me now?

256
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,630
Only what you did for yourself last night.

257
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,173
Confine you.

258
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,964
No, Doctor.

259
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,921
No.

260
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,515
I can't go through that again.

261
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,513
Talbot, listen.

262
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,720
Talbot. Talbot!

263
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,609
Talbot, come back!

264
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,467
Siegfried!

265
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,802
Siegfried!

266
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,722
There are many caves along
the coastline here made by the tides.

267
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,678
There's still a chance
that he can be saved.

268
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,649
We must think of the danger
to Dr. Edelmann.

269
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,858
If Mr. Talbot has been swept
into the cave down there,

270
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,486
he's still under the spell of the moon.

271
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,860
We must wait till it sets.

272
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,323
When it does, if he's still alive,
he'll try to destroy himself again.

273
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,744
That's why the Doctor must time
his actions to the very moment.

274
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:50,425
If he can find him just as the seizure
passes, and his reason returns...

275
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,753
Perhaps he can persuade him
to want to live.

276
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,550
Here we work half a night
to get this thing rigged up,

277
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,351
and then he says, "We'll wait a while."

278
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,681
What's going on around here anyway?

279
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,226
That's Dr. Edelmann's business.

280
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,812
Strange business, if you ask me.

281
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,322
All right, swing me out.

282
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,076
Lower away.

283
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,394
Easy!

284
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,027
All right!

285
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,879
I might've killed you.

286
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,841
Why did you follow me down here?

287
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,010
To bring you back, my boy.

288
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,673
Back to a life of misery and despair?

289
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,843
I only wanted to die.

290
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:02,575
You want to die,
but instead you will live,

291
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,862
because God, in his divine workings,

292
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,199
has lead you to the very thing
which makes help possible.

293
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,121
Look about you.

294
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,420
The temperature and humidity
down here are ideal

295
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,593
for growing the spore-producing plants.

296
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,794
Before the next full moon,

297
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,629
we should have more
than enough to help you.

298
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,385
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.

299
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,716
You can, my boy.

300
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,426
But you must do your part.

301
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,227
You must want to live.

302
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,236
The Frankenstein monster.

303
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:55,203
That must be the skeleton of Dr. Niemann,
who revitalized him years ago.

304
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,839
As the story goes,

305
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:03,002
the villagers drove them into the swamp,
and they went down in quicksand.

306
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:06,430
After all these years,
the mud has brought them here.

307
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,762
Still alive.

308
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,472
He's indestructible.

309
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,063
Frankenstein's creation

310
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,113
is man's challenge
to the laws of life and death.

311
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,951
Doctor!

312
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:30,738
Dr. Edelmann!

313
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,795
Doctor, look here.

314
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,639
There must be a way
out of here into the castle.

315
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,468
History mentions an old torture chamber.

316
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,638
But its entrance was sealed up years ago.

317
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:09,235
He was made bit by bit, piece by piece.

318
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,621
The undying monster.

319
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,959
Triumphant climax of
Frankenstein's genius.

320
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,079
The heart that Frankenstein
gave him never died.

321
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,915
The spark of life is still there,
waiting to be revived.

322
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,127
Dr. Edelmann, this thing
destroyed Frankenstein.

323
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,214
It's brought death to all who have
tried to follow in his footsteps.

324
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,924
Is that poor creature
responsible for what he is?

325
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,261
It's a thing of violence to whom
death would be a merciful release.

326
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,393
Can man sit in judgment
over life and death?

327
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,975
The evil he creates, he can also destroy.

328
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,685
That would be murder.

329
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,456
Think what you're doing, Doctor.

330
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,092
To bring him back again, Doctor, would
unleash worse than murder upon humanity.

331
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,636
That helpless body
is man's responsibility.

332
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,635
Man's responsibility is to his fellow man.

333
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,647
Perhaps you're right, Nina.

334
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,896
Frankenstein's monster
must never wreak havoc again.

335
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,409
Baron.

336
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,458
I didn't hear you come in.

337
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,876
Please, go on.

338
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,632
You like it?

339
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,639
It breathes the spirit of the night.

340
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,767
They played it the evening
we met at the concert.

341
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,723
I'd forgotten.

342
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,524
Until I saw you again.

343
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,315
Perhaps I wanted you to remember.

344
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:13,507
I've never heard this music before,
yet I'm playing it.

345
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,587
You're creating it...

346
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,760
For me.

347
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,886
It frightens me.

348
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,926
It's beautiful.

349
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,346
It's the music of the world
from which I come.

350
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,890
It makes me see strange things.

351
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,687
People who are dead, yet they're alive.

352
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,990
Mine is a world without material needs.

353
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,701
It calls to me,

354
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,529
but I'm afraid.

355
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,454
The fear will pass as the music
becomes fixed in your mind.

356
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,457
It will make you long to be there.

357
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,264
Why do you stop?

358
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,563
Play the music again.

359
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,444
There's something Dr. Edelmann

360
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,440
told me to do.

361
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,912
Roll up your sleeve, please, Baron.

362
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,416
The music will come to you again.

363
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,506
My world is waiting for you.

364
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,674
Forsake the cross so that
you can join me there.

365
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,132
Your world is coming closer to me.

366
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,142
But I'm afraid.

367
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,474
It is a world without fear.

368
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,061
It is like the music.

369
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,275
Beautiful. Beautiful.

370
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,190
Oh, good evening, Baron.

371
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,160
Thank you, Miliza. That'll be all.

372
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,248
I feel that we're making progress, Baron.

373
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:52,248
This photomiorograph of your
blood reveals an odd condition.

374
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,705
One which I can't account for as yet.

375
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:55,914
What is it, Doctor?

376
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,375
A different species
of antibodies has appeared.

377
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,970
Why worry so long as the treatments
are proving successful?

378
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:05,303
If a doctor affects a cure,
he wants to know how he did it.

379
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:09,262
Which is of little concern to the patient
so long as he's being cured.

380
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,017
Day after tomorrow?

381
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,723
At the same time.

382
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,399
Then good night, Doctor.

383
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,087
Please go to bed, Miliza.

384
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,131
I'll finish down here.

385
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,833
I think I will.

386
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,649
Miliza!

387
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,707
Miliza! Are you all right?

388
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,321
The music is bringing my world closer.

389
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:33,822
Closer.

390
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,076
Doctor, Baron Latos...

391
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,206
He left here early
this evening, didn't he?

392
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,038
About half past 8:00. Why?

393
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,418
I...

394
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,669
I...

395
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,425
Miliza and I were working.

396
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,048
What are you trying to tell me?
Come, speak up.

397
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,256
She seemed awfully tired.

398
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,931
Like a person in a trance.

399
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,133
In a trance?

400
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,310
She left me without saying a word.

401
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,978
I followed her.

402
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,518
She met Baron Latos in the hall.

403
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,808
They went into the garden.

404
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:13,366
And when he walked in front of the mirror,
I couldn't see his reflection.

405
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,247
I imagined that, didn't I?

406
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,950
Didn't I?

407
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,285
No, Nina.

408
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,415
Baron Latos shows no reflection.

409
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,791
Then he...

410
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,669
He's Count Dracula.

411
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,045
In trying to save him,
I've endangered the lives of all of you.

412
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,220
Then cast away the cross
so that you may join me there.

413
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,262
I must try to stop him
before it's too late.

414
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,438
But how?

415
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,981
Prepare for a transfusion at once.

416
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,479
You can't give another one so soon.

417
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,650
Do as I tell you.

418
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,229
If anything should happen to me tonight,

419
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,111
go into the old armor room in the basement
and burn what you find there.

420
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,237
What is it, Doctor?

421
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,445
You'll understand.
You must destroy it by fire.

422
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,007
Go to your room.

423
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,589
When you hear the music,
I will come to you.

424
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,307
I've been looking for you, Baron.

425
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,436
You remember that I was puzzled
tonight by the new antibodies?

426
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:24,854
Yes.

427
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,230
I know now where they came from.

428
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,936
They're from my blood.

429
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,397
We may be on the verge
of an important discovery.

430
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,485
So, to check my theory,
I'm going to give you another transfusion.

431
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,989
Now?

432
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,446
Immediately.

433
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,952
If this is the answer, we must see.

434
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,483
Doctor.

435
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,731
Dr. Edelmann!

436
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,594
Doctor!

437
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,429
Dr. Edelmann!

438
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,069
He's gone.

439
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,241
Mr. Talbot!

440
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,821
Mr. Talbot!

441
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,278
- Miliza.
- She's all right now.

442
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,947
But what about him?

443
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,954
The evil I brought here
will never live again.

444
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,147
They tried to kill you, but they couldn't.

445
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,442
Frankenstein gave you eternal life.

446
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,659
Power which time cannot destroy.

447
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,913
The secret of immortality,
it will soon be mine.

448
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,693
Dr. Edelmann?

449
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,189
Go away. Leave me alone.

450
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:20,031
Dr. Edelmann, I have some coffee for you.

451
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:21,363
Go away, I tell you.

452
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,867
Dr. Edelmann, let me in!

453
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,292
Doctor.

454
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,085
Doctor, you're ill.

455
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,872
No.

456
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,008
I'm all right.

457
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,596
That'll make you feel better.

458
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,221
How much of the spore concentrate
have we ready?

459
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,147
Don't worry about that now.

460
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,565
We're making fine progress.

461
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,857
Answer me.

462
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,356
Is there enough for two operations?

463
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:37,530
No, there won't be for some time.

464
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,152
But we do have enough for one?

465
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,574
I think so.

466
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,152
Then I must operate
as soon as possible, on you.

467
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,030
- But Doctor...
- You were right, Nina.

468
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,205
I am ill.

469
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,080
It's impossible to know
what the future holds.

470
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,499
There, there, Doctor.

471
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,296
You mustn't talk like that.

472
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,215
I'll operate tomorrow, Nina.

473
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,844
Then you must operate on Mr. Talbot.

474
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,931
The moon will be full in a few days.

475
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,058
We can't let him suffer again.

476
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:09,937
But you... You've waited such a long time.

477
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,724
Then I can wait a little longer.

478
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:15,105
It won't make any difference.

479
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,438
You're worn out.

480
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,148
Why don't you get some rest?

481
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,653
I'm all right.

482
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,444
I know who you're thinking of.

483
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,495
I'm hoping we'll be ready in time.

484
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,453
I can't stand the thought of him
having to go through that again.

485
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,794
Don't worry, we'll have enough.

486
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,846
Why, it's wonderful, Dr. Edelmann.

487
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:53,681
What you've done would ordinarily mean
an operation of the most delicate nature.

488
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,477
This way, the dangers
of surgery didn't even exist.

489
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,696
We can expect some nervous shock.

490
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,279
He must be kept quiet.

491
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,862
Any exertion might undo everything
I hope we've accomplished.

492
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:15,120
We'll know in a few days, Miliza.

493
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,045
All we can do now is hope.

494
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,498
And pray.

495
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,921
We must think now only of Nina.

496
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:27,298
Every minute must be devoted to
producing more of the concentrate.

497
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,382
For her.

498
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,555
You're a fine nurse, Miliza.

499
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:38,142
You know perfectly well Mr. Talbot
should be asleep by now.

500
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,442
Sleep?

501
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,987
I'll have a lifetime in which to sleep,

502
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,649
when I know what lies ahead.

503
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,702
After what Dr. Edelmann has done
for you, only happiness lies ahead.

504
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,327
I wonder.

505
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,426
Please don't think that I'm ungrateful.

506
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,014
Time after time,
people have tried to help me.

507
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,229
Time after time, they've failed.

508
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,559
- If this fails, I...
- It won't fail, Larry.

509
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,360
You must believe that it won't.

510
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,778
I've tried to.

511
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,364
But when I face the night...

512
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,409
Try to see the night
as something beautiful.

513
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:32,618
Until the full moon turns it into
a thing of ugliness and horror.

514
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,038
Soon, you'll see it as everyone else does.

515
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,711
Restful, tranquil and serene.

516
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,467
Until that time comes,

517
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,675
I'll live 1,000 hopes,

518
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,723
die 1,000 times.

519
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:54,222
It will never be ugly to you again, Larry.

520
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,224
Believe me, I know it.

521
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,893
How do you know that?

522
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,438
My heart tells me.

523
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,535
Hello, Siegfried.

524
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,030
Dr. Edelmann!

525
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,037
Did you hear me call to you, Siegfried?

526
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,788
Why, no, sir.

527
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:03,121
I would have stopped for you if I had.

528
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,171
I'm certain you would have.

529
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,833
Don't worry about it, Siegfried.

530
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,969
What's the matter, Siegfried?

531
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,430
You act as though you were afraid.

532
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,761
Oh, no, sir.

533
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,810
Why should I be afraid?

534
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,857
Of the night, perhaps?

535
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,185
I'm not afraid of the night.

536
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,571
Your hands are trembling, Siegfried.

537
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,399
Are they?

538
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,074
Siegfried.

539
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,451
Yes, sir?

540
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,574
I believe I know what you're afraid of.

541
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:37,701
Do you?

542
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,407
You're afraid of me.

543
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,491
Of you, sir?

544
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,578
'Cause if you weren't,
you'd look at me, Siegfried.

545
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:47,665
Hyah!

546
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:48,920
Hyah!

547
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,342
See, you are afraid of me.

548
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,714
You're driving faster and faster,

549
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:53,888
so that you can get into
the village and tell the police.

550
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,512
Why? Why should I want
to tell the police anything?

551
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,093
Because you're afraid
I'm going to kill you!

552
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,928
Kill me? Doctor!

553
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,810
Yes. You've seen what's
happened to your old friend.

554
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,358
He doesn't want anybody
but himself to know about that.

555
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,685
No, Doctor!

556
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,611
I will never tell!

557
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,860
That's right, Siegfried. You never will!

558
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,616
Help! Help!

559
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:18,946
Help!

560
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,826
Help! Help!

561
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,006
There he is! There he is!

562
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,667
This way!

563
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,002
This way!

564
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,768
It's your brother, Siegfried.

565
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,266
Is he dead?

566
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,066
There he goes!

567
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,707
Good evening, Inspector.

568
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,584
I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor,

569
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:17,758
but I'd like to see Mr. Talbot
and everybody else in the house at once.

570
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,255
Certainly.

571
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,220
- Is something wrong?
- You'll know in good time, Doctor.

572
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,468
Now, please hurry.

573
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,647
Now, Inspector, what is it?

574
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,484
Your man Siegfried's been murdered.

575
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,811
Siegfried?

576
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:37,986
Murdered?

577
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,406
By the person who rode
into the village with him tonight.

578
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,985
His throat was torn open as though
by some enraged animal.

579
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,242
So naturally you suspect me.

580
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,574
I have good reason to.

581
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,249
But he hasn't been out
of the house for days.

582
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,453
Not to your knowledge, perhaps.

583
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,912
Have you been with him all evening?

584
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,998
Until an hour ago.

585
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,759
Well, the murder was only
committed 20 minutes ago.

586
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,586
And within the last five minutes,

587
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,172
we pursued the murderer
to these very grounds.

588
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,178
But it's impossible, Inspector.

589
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,476
Only the full moon affects Mr. Talbot.

590
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,020
The moon won't be full
again until tomorrow night.

591
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,144
Not only that, Inspector,
but Mr. Talbot has undergone an operation

592
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,942
which makes physical
exertion out of the question.

593
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,443
Running even a short distance,
much less from the village,

594
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,239
would cause serious complications.

595
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,444
A cerebral hemorrhage,
perhaps even his death.

596
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:29,530
I respect your word, Doctor,
but a murder has been committed.

597
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,911
It's imperative that I search
your premises immediately.

598
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,583
He's the man you want.

599
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,957
Are you gonna let Dr. Edelmann
talk you out of it?

600
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,789
That's enough, Steinmuhl. That's enough.

601
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,294
I apologize, Doctor,

602
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,173
but the man who killed his brother
is somewhere around here.

603
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,003
It's my duty to find him.

604
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:48,682
I shall hold you responsible
for these people until further notice.

605
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,607
Yes?

606
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,990
What are you doing here, my boy?

607
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,742
You shouldn't be up.

608
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,664
Never mind me, Doctor.

609
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,417
It's you I'm worried about.

610
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:20,001
You were with Siegfried tonight
when he went to the village.

611
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,423
I saw you.

612
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,259
I saw you when you came back.

613
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,473
Why didn't you tell Inspector Holtz?

614
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,593
After what you've done for me?

615
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,354
Why, you tried to help me.

616
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,644
And you want to help me now?

617
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,935
If I possibly can.

618
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:45,985
Because you suffered the tortures
I'm going through now,

619
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,613
you of all people will understand
what I'm going to say.

620
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,663
In trying to perform
the miracle of medical science,

621
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:54,956
I failed.

622
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:59,495
My blood has been contaminated
by the blood of Dracula.

623
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:04,292
My soul and mind have been
seized by some nameless horror,

624
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:09,634
a lust which changes me into the thing
that killed Siegfried tonight.

625
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,266
You wish to help me?

626
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,093
There's one way in which you can.

627
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,056
Say nothing to Inspector
Holtz of what you know.

628
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,561
Not to protect me, but to give me time.

629
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,314
Time to do for Nina
what I've done for you.

630
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:30,322
After that, this evil
thing must be destroyed.

631
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,325
You have my word that it will be, my boy.

632
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:39,535
But if I am unable,

633
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,380
you must do it for me.

634
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,341
Dr. Franz Edelmann.

635
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:58,770
Bonn University, cum laude.

636
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,183
What's going on here?

637
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,236
I was just on my way over
to your office, Inspector.

638
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,313
I want you to take a look at this.

639
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,990
I found it clenched in
Siegfried's left hand.

640
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,364
Dr. Edelmann killed him.

641
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,078
Be quiet, Steinmuhl.

642
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:18,577
You don't know what this means.
Neither do I.

643
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:20,659
It's obviously a matter
for the police to handle.

644
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,789
Is that clear?

645
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,714
It's clear Dr. Edelmann killed my brother.

646
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:28,254
Last night, you thought it was Talbot.

647
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:31,299
Tonight, you say it's a man who we all
have known and respected for years.

648
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:34,097
Good heavens, you're worse
than a gossiping old woman.

649
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,424
Go home. Go home.

650
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:36,846
Go home, all of you!

651
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:40,225
I'm sick and tired of this. Come on,
break it up. Break it up, come on.

652
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,934
Something's going on
at Dr. Edelmann's, I tell you.

653
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,274
What does Holtz have to say about it?

654
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,191
"This is a matter for
the police to handle."

655
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,448
It's a matter for us to handle,

656
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,705
unless we all want to be murdered.

657
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:00,664
He's right.

658
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,492
I'm for doing something about it.

659
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,328
Well, I don't know, now.

660
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:05,879
I'm with you.

661
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,398
The next few moments
will give us our answer.

662
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,191
It's the time we've all
been looking forward to.

663
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,645
You must put fear out of your mind.

664
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:32,197
Confront it with a belief
that the past is over with,

665
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,366
that a new life lies ahead.

666
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,118
A new life.

667
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,213
Stay here, please. All of you.

668
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,306
- But, Larry...
- No!

669
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,184
Not until we can be sure.

670
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,244
Doctor, it's wonderful.

671
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,545
Dr. Edelmann? Doctor!

672
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,317
That's it. That's it.

673
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,947
Now! Now!

674
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,752
That's it. That's it.

675
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:58,377
I'll make you strong,
stronger than you've ever been.

676
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,095
I'll give you the strength of 100 men.

677
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:02,923
No, Dr. Edelmann.

678
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,263
No! You promised.

679
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,475
What are you doing here?

680
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,771
Why, I...

681
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,229
You were spying on me, weren't you?

682
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:17,062
No, I just wanted to find you.

683
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:19,781
I wanted to tell you that I...

684
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,608
You shouldn't have done that, Nina.

685
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,082
I want to see Dr. Edelmann at once.

686
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,119
You shouldn't have come here.

687
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:39,923
I don't like people who see
what they're not supposed to see.

688
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,892
- Doctor!
- He's gone mad.

689
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:08,326
Hello, Mr. Talbot.

690
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,083
You broke your promise to me, didn't you?

691
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,669
You told the police.

692
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:18,965
I don't like people who break
their promises, Mr. Talbot.

693
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,681
Get out! The Frankenstein monster!
