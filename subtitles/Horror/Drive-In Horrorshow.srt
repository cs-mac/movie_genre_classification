What the hell
are you doing here?

4
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:32,041
You've got a problem
with a stowaway.

5
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,475
What do you mean?

6
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:06,311
Right on time.

00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:06,150
Call off the search

00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:09,818

early morning drink

is turning into
a career for you, Malik.

00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:39,086
Yeah, but the pay sucks, Joey.

Beer.

21
00:06:05,722 --> 00:06:08,020
You know, the only reason
I open up so early

22
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:10,754
is to keep your out-of-work ass
off the streets,

23
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:12,188
and now I have customers.

24
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,821
Well, why don't you
tell your customers

25
00:06:16,822 --> 00:06:19,854
about the importance of a good
breakfast and leave me alone?

26
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:22,221
Let me write, okay, please, Joe?

27
00:06:22,222 --> 00:06:25,054
Like I said, my time is coming.

28
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:27,121
You look out that door.
Look out there.

29
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:29,355
What do you see? My time.
Right out that door.

30
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:29,999
And I'm gonna take you with me cause
you can sing a little bit, right?

31
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,688
And I'm gonna take you with me cause
you can sing a little bit, right?

32
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:35,089
Just like
Johnny fucking cash, baby.

33
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,757
Johnny fucking cash.
That's all I need.

34
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:45,856
Hey, you look like
a music lover.

35
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:47,023
Check it out.

36
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:50,657
Hit song right there.

37
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,026
Take the back. Right.

38
00:08:36,163 --> 00:08:38,997
Shoot his legs.

39
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:55,231
Okay, okay.

40
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:04,031
Shit, shit, shit.

41
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:05,931
Put the gun down, or he's dead.

42
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:07,731
Come on, man. Let's talk
this out, like gentlemen.

43
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:09,564
This is between you and me.

44
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:11,465
Like gentlemen, please.

45
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:14,865
Shut up.

46
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:18,765
Put the gun down.

47
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,899
Put it down.

48
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,033
He's running out of time.

49
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,433
We'll pick this up later.

50
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,866
Freeze!

51
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,066
I've got a wife,
and a family, and kids.

52
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,866
Thank god you're here!

53
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,500
You move any closer
and I'll kill him.

54
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:50,634
Kill me? What are you
talking-- shut up!

55
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:52,600
Back off.

56
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:55,467
Hey, just be cool, man.
Just let him go.

57
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:57,467
We don't want to see
anybody else get hurt.

58
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:58,700
You just put the gun down.

59
00:09:58,701 --> 00:09:59,999
You follow me, he dies.

60
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
You follow me, he dies.

61
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:06,903
Oh, my god.

62
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:17,868
Come on, let's go.

63
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,868
We are going.
This ain't the Batmobile, man.

64
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,035
You want me to throw a rod?
It's an old car.

65
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:22,969
Just drive.

66
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:29,999
Look out!

67
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,500
Look out!

68
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:46,970
Oh, my paint. Baby, I'm sorry.
Your paint?

69
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:48,503
You're gonna get us killed.

70
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:50,870
Easy, easy.
Did I scare you? I'm sorry.

71
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:52,737
Did I put your life in danger?
Shit.

72
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,604
Shit is right.

73
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,371
I'm not the bad guy, okay?

74
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:57,504
What?

75
00:10:57,505 --> 00:10:59,999
Just relax and drive.

76
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,005
Just relax and drive.

77
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:03,005
Relax?

78
00:11:03,006 --> 00:11:07,738
Relax and drive with a gun pointed at me.
What did I do?

79
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:09,338
I'm not going to hurt you.

80
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:10,905
Just keep driving. Okay.

81
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:13,472
Oh, hey, man,
anything you say goes.

82
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,871
You're the boss, Mr. gunman.

83
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:17,872
You're the boss.
You're the boss, man.

84
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:19,872
Hey, easy, easy, cousin.

85
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:21,772
Easy cousin. I'm just
going for my cigarettes.

86
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:24,805
Cigarettes, see? Too fine cigs.

87
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:28,972
Cigarettes, cousin. You smoke?

88
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:29,999
Those things will kill you.

89
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,006
Those things will kill you.

90
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,940
Don't smoke in the car.

91
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:38,473
I'm sorry.
You don't want me to smoke?

92
00:11:38,474 --> 00:11:40,007
In my car?

93
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:41,606
Can I open a window and smoke?

94
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:42,973
Oh, this is fucking beautiful.

95
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:44,574
This is fucking--

96
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:46,907
You know what? You're right.
I'm going to quit.

97
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:48,973
I don't know who died
and left you surgeon general,

98
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,507
but you're absolutely right.
I'm going to quit.

99
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:51,874
Tell me something.
Tell me one thing.

100
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,440
Who long do I have
to put up with this shit?

101
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,474
Where are we going?

102
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:58,309
Los Angeles.

103
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:02,874
Los Angeles? Are you out
of your fucking mind?

104
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,974
Excuse me, yosemite Sam.

105
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:06,008
Wong. Toby Wong.

106
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,441
Hey hey, Malik Brody. Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.

107
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:11,042
Do me a favor, man. Find some
other brother with a better car,

108
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:13,475
kidnap him, and make him
put the miles on his car.

109
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,508
I can't do it.
I'm not going to do it.

110
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:19,676
I'm sorry but you
don't have a choice.

111
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,843
All right. That's typical.

112
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,609
That is so typical.

113
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,376
You know, you just
fresh off the boat,

114
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:28,609
kidnap the first
brother you see,

115
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,999
and force him
to be your chauffeur.

116
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,477
And force him
to be your chauffeur.

117
00:12:30,478 --> 00:12:31,676
You don't look like miss Daisy.

118
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:33,343
I should be driving you
no fucking--

119
00:12:33,344 --> 00:12:34,311
Shut up.

120
00:12:58,512 --> 00:12:59,999
In English.

121
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,345
In English.

122
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,444
Vic Madison for Mr. la...

123
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:04,612
<i>One moment.</i>

124
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:12,445
<i>What's that, Walter?</i>

125
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:13,612
<i>Pancreatic cancer?</i>

126
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:15,612
<i>Mr. Madison.</i>

127
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:17,546
<i>Judging by your expression,</i>

128
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,679
<i>you have unfortunate
news to convey.</i>

129
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,712
Oh, I got to hand
it to you, Mr. lau,

130
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:24,445
no one pulls the wool
over your eyes.

131
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:26,313
<i>You haven't recovered
our property?</i>

132
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:28,913
Nope. <i>I'm disappointed.</i>

133
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:29,999
No shit.

134
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,347
No shit.

135
00:13:30,348 --> 00:13:32,914
<i>Your arrogance never
ceases to amaze me.</i>

136
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:35,513
I don't know about
arrogance, Mr. lau,

137
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,480
but I do know I enjoy my work,

138
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:39,880
and the object you've lost
is about to supply me

139
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:42,580
with a sizeable
amount of pleasure.

140
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:45,648
<i>If you knew that you
would be held responsible</i>

141
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,980
<i>if the competition
acquired this object--</i>

142
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:51,915
Now, Mr. lau, I have been
a faithful employee,

143
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,447
and you know that.

144
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:56,181
Even as we speak,
action is taking place

145
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:59,999
to recover your object.
There's no need for threats.

146
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,515
To recover your object.
There's no need for threats.

147
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:03,248
<i>Of course not.</i>

148
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,683
<i>The leung corporation.
Have a nice day.</i>

149
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:09,448
Sayonara, shithead.

150
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,649
Must be nice being married
to the boss' daughter.

151
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,417
<i>Walter, you've just saved the
life of the president's son.</i>

152
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:24,884
Would you turn that shit off?

153
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:39,584
Must be a routine d-u-i stop.

154
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:42,284
In the middle of the day?

155
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:45,351
Don't do anything stupid.

156
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:00,000
Howdy. Sir?

157
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:02,184
Howdy. Sir?

158
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,152
Can I see your license,
your registration,

159
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,518
and proof of insurance, please?

160
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,652
Yes, you may, officer.
Yes you may.

161
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:10,420
I got that right here.

162
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:16,854
There you go,
there you go, there you go.

163

Samuel Hong.

165
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:38,520
Can you step
out of the car, please?

166
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,354
Me? Yes. Yes, sir,
I would be glad to.

167

Freeze, asshole!

Hey, what?

169
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:47,421
Get your hands out of the

nice and slow.

Out of the window. Yeah, yeah.

172
00:15:50,756 --> 00:15:52,688
Open the door.
I know the routine, okay?

173
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,788
So, let's not go
too rough on me.

174
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,555
Get out, right up
against the car.

00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,188
Turn around, get your
hands behind your head.

my throat with a paper napkin,

you better start talking.

00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:10,891
Come on man,
I want to know the truth.

324
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:13,159
We ain't got time to bullshit.

325
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:17,824
I used to work for
the government in Hong Kong.

326
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:21,058
After the red Chinese
took over in '97,

327
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,024
they put one
of these things in me.

328
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:25,526
A prototype.

329
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,999
I'm here because I heard that
there's a corporation in L.A.,

330
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,625
I'm here because I heard that
there's a corporation in L.A.,

331
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:34,959
con tech, that wants
to buy the implant.

332
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,959
All I have to do is get down
there, deliver it to them,

333
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,226
and they will pay me five
million dollars for it.

334
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:44,060
Five million dollars?

335
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:48,161
And, of course, the red Chinese
don't want you to sell it.

336
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:51,926
Tell me something,
does everybody live happily

337
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,926
ever after at the end
of this fairy tale?

338
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:55,193
Look, I'll make you a deal.

339
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:58,126
Please, monty hall, no deals.
No, no, listen.

340
00:26:58,127 --> 00:26:59,999
All you do is,
you help me get to L.A.,

341
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,927
all you do is,
you help me get to L.A.,

342
00:27:00,928 --> 00:27:03,194
I'll give you half the money.
What do you say?

343
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:06,695
I say, we go to my house,
we get a hack--

344
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:11,494
Half the money like two million,

345
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:15,429
five hundred thousand dollars,
half the money?

346
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:19,494
It's not enough?

347
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:20,561
No. No?

348
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:21,995
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

349
00:27:21,996 --> 00:27:23,995
I mean, no--
Hey, would you cut it out?

350
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:26,062
Don't do that bugs bunny
stuff with me, all right?

351
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:29,596
Just, no, we're not--
No. Absolutely not.

352
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:30,000
I can't.

353
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:32,095
I can't.

354
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:34,529
You don't expect me to believe
this fire engine--

355
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,495
Bio-engine. Biological energy
module. It makes me go fast.

356
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:39,630
Bio-engine, fire-engine,
whatever.

357
00:27:51,898 --> 00:27:53,563
This is your house?

358
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:57,064
Not exactly.

359
00:27:57,065 --> 00:27:59,999
Look, I've only been
a barfly since I lost my job,

360
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,930
look, I've only been
a barfly since I lost my job,

361
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:04,664
and my wife,

362
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:07,665
and my house.

363
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:16,165
Yeah, look at that.
That super-scientifical

364
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:19,432
hard stuff, it ain't so bad.

365
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:21,733
It'll cut.

366
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:38,966
What the hell
are you doing here?

367
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,800
Uh, well--
What the hell is going on?

368
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:43,833
Take it easy, Karen.
I can explain.

369
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:45,933
This guy here, he kidnapped me,

370
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,666
but now he's going to let me go.

371
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:50,666
Oh, my god. Are you
in trouble with the law?

372
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:53,067
No. I'm not.

373
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:55,467
I'm good, but, uh,
but he's on some other shit.

374
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:58,634
They going to fry his ass,
you don't want to know.

375
00:28:58,635 --> 00:28:59,999
Why aren't you at work?

376
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,368
Why aren't you at work?

377
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:03,500
I had to meet a deadline.
I was at work all night.

378
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:06,467
All night? So wait a minute, that
means you left Bria with the asshole?

379
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:09,435
His name is Steve. How many times do
I have to tell you? Oh, I'm sorry.

380
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:12,635
The asshole part is silent. You
know what, that's a real nice

381
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,602
kmart family portrait old Steve
paid for, that's a nice portrait.

382
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:16,101
But it ain't his family.

383
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:17,802
At least he's a grown up.

384
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:19,702
He's a fucking cheeseburger.
He works for a living.

385
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:21,435
He's a cheeseburger.
A cheeseburger?

386
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:25,035
Yes, a nasty, fat,
coagulating around your heart,

387
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:28,636
not good for you cheeseburger. And you know
what? I don't think you like this Steve guy

388
00:29:28,637 --> 00:29:29,999
as much as you pretend to.
You know why?

389
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,669
As much as you pretend to.
You know why?

390
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,936
Why? Because you didn't hit me
when I called him a cheeseburger.

391
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:38,636
And the only nice thing you can
say about him is he's a grownup?

392
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:42,338
That's better than being
an aimless, irresponsible fool.

393
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:46,404
That's right, a fool.

394
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,770
Look, I can't have
you around here.

395
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:52,370
I just want you
to saw your handcuffs off,

396
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:54,037
do whatever you got to do,

397
00:29:54,038 --> 00:29:55,604
and leave.

398
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:57,037
Karen...

399
00:29:57,038 --> 00:29:58,805
Please.

400
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,038
I hate this Steve guy.

401
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,006
Me, too.

402
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:16,638
God. Thank you,
but that shit I did not need.

403
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:18,572
Once I get you
to the bus station, man,

404
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:21,672
I'm dropping you off and I'm
finding me a new favorite bar.

405
00:30:21,673 --> 00:30:25,473
I don't need this. She leaves
my kid with that asshole.

406
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,606
God, what is this, man?

407
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:29,999
I can't understand.
Women make me sick.

408
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,639
I can't understand.
Women make me sick.

409
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,274
Oh, man. Leaves my kid
with the asshole, man.

410
00:30:47,874 --> 00:30:50,307
How long have you been divorced?

411
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:51,307
What?

412
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,374
I think she still loves you.

413
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,008
Oh, you do? I do.

414
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,841
I think...

415
00:30:59,842 --> 00:31:00,000
I think you should
go catch your bus.

416
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:01,942
I think you should
go catch your bus.

417
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,507
Come on, man. Give me one.

418
00:31:06,508 --> 00:31:07,975
For old time's sake.
Don't hurt me, now.

419
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:12,675
Ah, you hit so hard,
you bad ass.

420
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:14,576
Take care of yourself, man.

421
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:28,210
Man, oh man, oh man, oh man.

422
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:30,000
She still loves you.

423
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:32,277
She still loves you.

424
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,476
And I love you, man

425
00:31:38,477 --> 00:31:40,344
stay fruity, man.

426
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:41,611
Don't twist any ankles.

427
00:31:43,378 --> 00:31:45,311
Don't pull any groins.

428
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:56,745
Let's get out of here.

429
00:32:03,512 --> 00:32:05,212
Oh, shit.

430
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:13,778
Oh, no. He's going
to have to handle them.

431
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:17,279
I can't do three. I can't.

432
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,879
No, I can't.

Sir.

443
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:48,420
How was your trip?

444
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:51,654
I...Excuse me?

445
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:54,622
A long, miserable flight,

446
00:34:54,623 --> 00:34:57,421
made short and pleasant

447
00:34:57,422 --> 00:34:59,999
by new technology.

448
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,055
By new technology.

449
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:05,455
Yes, sir.
A very pleasant flight.

450
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:09,588
A pleasant flight?

451
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:13,656
You failed to capture Toby Wong,

452
00:35:13,657 --> 00:35:18,156
and yet you had a pleasant trip?

453
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:21,423
That is not what I meant, sir.

454
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:26,390
A leung corporation
advanced model.

455
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,725
What Toby Wong could have been.

456
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:37,323
Again, new technology,

457
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:41,024
capable of turning a long,
miserable death

458
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:45,058
into a short,
not quite pleasant one.

459
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,026
Prepare a group of our finest.

460
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:26,194
You're going hunting.

461
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:40,461
Hey, man?

462
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:42,027
Hey, man. Talk to me.

463
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:44,427
Tell me about China.

464
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:47,061
Is there a lot of kung-fu
shit going on over there?

465
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:50,028
What? What do you mean?

466
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:52,128
I mean, is it like,
guys running up to each other

467
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:53,595
on the street, talking about,

468
00:36:53,596 --> 00:36:56,961
"hmm, your kung-fu
is pretty useless

469
00:36:56,962 --> 00:36:59,595
"as well as obsolete.
You insult me.

470
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:00,000
You bastard.
Prepare to die. Hmm."

471
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:02,962
You bastard.
Prepare to die. Hmm."

472
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:05,929
No, not a whole lot, no.

473
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,895
Really?

474
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:11,329
You know, I would've thought...

475
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:14,596
A lot of people have some sort
of martial arts training,

476
00:37:14,597 --> 00:37:19,097
but you don't see much chop chop
going on in restaurants or anything.

477
00:37:19,098 --> 00:37:22,396
Hmm. That's funny. The image
that Americans have of China

478
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:25,230
is that it's a country full of
people with little tiny feet,

479
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:28,997
and they run around and kick the
shit out of each other every day.

480
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:29,999
That's the same image
we have of America,

481
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,530
that's the same image
we have of America,

482
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:33,130
except you guys have big feet,

483
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:35,932
and you kick the shit out
of each other less gracefully.

484
00:37:37,932 --> 00:37:39,199
I can see that.

485
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:42,465
Oh, shit.

486
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:45,064
Oh, man, what next?

487
00:37:45,065 --> 00:37:46,598
Hey, I think we blew a hose.

488
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,164
We're going to have
to make a stop.

489
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,431
A little town coming up,
we can get a motel room.

490
00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:52,032
You can sleep, I'll fix the car.

491
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,965
I thought we decided
on the safe approach?

492
00:37:53,966 --> 00:37:56,431
Toby, safe or not,
if I don't stop and fix it,

493
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:58,166
we won't get a mile
down the road.

Yeah, wow.

Tell me, how you doing?

00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:44,534
Oh, man. This thing
is a real piece of shit.

504
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:46,801
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to offend you, there,

505
00:38:46,802 --> 00:38:48,235
I've just never seen anything

00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:50,902

That sounds real bad.

Actually--
Do you need a room?

509

Actually--
Do you need a room?

510
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:03,436
Please, please tell me
that you need a room. Please.

511
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,136
You want a room?

512
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:12,037
Yeah, we need a room.

513
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:20,537
So, what shall
we make that, a double?

514
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:24,104
Oh, yeah. He's a blanket hog.

515
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:26,037
Uh, I know all about that.

516
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:29,371
My boyfriend's
a real blanket hog.

517
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:29,999
Ex-boyfriend.

518
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,004
Ex-boyfriend.

519
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:37,171
Ex-citing.

520
00:39:37,172 --> 00:39:39,771
My much too trusting parents
took off on business,

521
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:41,205
and they left me
in charge of this place.

522
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:44,305
The only problem is that there
are no guests in the motel

523
00:39:44,306 --> 00:39:46,171
and the remodeling
guys won't be back

524
00:39:46,172 --> 00:39:49,038
for at least another three days.

525
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,071
Let me see...

You all right, kid?
You look wiped out.

00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:55,905
The implant

Keeps the adrenaline pumping.

529
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,373
You get high,
but you crash hard.

530

Dig it.

532
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,806
I think this should be the biggest
party opportunity of my young life

533
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:09,206
and nobody to share it with.

534
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,806
Oh, that's rough.

535
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:12,272
Look, do we have
any forms to fill out?

536

You're in luck, magilla gorilla.

the deliverance party

00:40:23,775 --> 00:40:25,907
Oh, what does
that include, exactly?

541
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:29,041
Exactly. Lots of sleep, I hope.

542
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:29,999
No, it exactly includes
free room and board.

543

Is the second floor okay?

552
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:53,742
We've got double beds,

555
00:40:56,777 --> 00:40:59,175
Oh, also, my dad has this huge
garage right next door

556
00:40:59,176 --> 00:40:59,999
if you guys want to use it
to fix up your car.

557
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,442
If you guys want to use it
to fix up your car.

558
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:03,976
Oh, yeah, that would be great.

Thank you. You're welcome. Bye.

Hey? Listen,
be careful going up the stairs

561
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,143
'cause we're going through
some renovations.

562
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:14,343
All right.

563

Hey.

Huh?

565
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,277
Nothing.

566
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:27,011
Yeah.

He's trying to make me look bad.

571
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:43,878
He's always tried
to make me look bad,

572
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:46,612
even before he got
wound up with that turbo-drive.

573
00:41:46,613 --> 00:41:49,746
I knew he'd be trouble.

574
00:41:49,747 --> 00:41:50,946
He's good.

575
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:52,846
Yeah, damn right he's good.

Don't talk about cupcakes.

578
00:41:59,913 --> 00:42:00,000
I am going to carve him up.

579

I am going to carve him up.

580

01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:36,802
There's been a fluctuation
in the adrenaline level.

970
01:26:36,803 --> 01:26:39,235
His body may be nearing
the point of exhaustion.

971
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:42,369
Boost the implants
on the advanced model.

972
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:44,370
Which ones?

973
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:50,737
Every one.

974
01:27:47,407 --> 01:27:50,707
Atta boy. Let her buck.

975
01:28:21,342 --> 01:28:24,475
I don't have to kill you.

976
01:28:24,476 --> 01:28:29,009
You can return
with me to Hong Kong.

977
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:29,999
No.

978
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,043
No.

979
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:41,644
<i>System overload.</i>

980
01:29:19,512 --> 01:29:23,046
You pulled a whip on me? Are
you out of your fucking mind?

981
01:29:25,046 --> 01:29:26,212
Let me tell you something.

982
01:29:26,213 --> 01:29:28,978
Don't you ever pull a whip

983
01:29:28,979 --> 01:29:29,999
on a black man again.

984
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,213
On a black man again.

985
01:30:18,949 --> 01:30:21,116
Total system failure.

986
01:30:42,984 --> 01:30:45,284
We'll simply make more.

987
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:52,217
So, he wasn't so bad, was he?

988
01:30:52,218 --> 01:30:54,517
Nah.

989
01:30:54,518 --> 01:30:55,551
Come on.

990
01:30:55,552 --> 01:30:57,150
We have a paycheck to collect.

991
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:59,184
Yeah, you got
an employee to pay.

992
01:30:59,185 --> 01:30:59,999
You get a bonus.
Oh, I like that.

993
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,280
You get a bonus.
Oh, I like that.

994
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:08,254
Time to blow.

995
01:32:08,255 --> 01:32:10,289
Time to blow?

996
01:32:14,756 --> 01:32:16,256
Shit!

997
01:33:09,059 --> 01:33:10,680
All right, Tobe,
let's get going.

998
01:33:10,681 --> 01:33:12,582
We got money to collect.

999
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,517
We got hotels to build.

1000
01:33:14,518 --> 01:33:17,087
And a wife and kid
to go home to.

1001
01:33:17,088 --> 01:33:19,522
Exactly. Yes.

1002
01:33:19,523 --> 01:33:22,058
Wife and kid. Yeah, man.
You know what, I'm gonna...

1003
01:33:22,059 --> 01:33:25,128
I'm going to do everything I
can to make it work this time.

1004
01:33:25,129 --> 01:33:27,230
Who is she kidding?
She can't live without me.

1005
01:33:27,231 --> 01:33:29,099
She's a lucky girl.

1006
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:29,999
There you go. I think
I might have to pull out

1007
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,267
there you go. I think
I might have to pull out

1008
01:33:31,268 --> 01:33:35,805
my tiger fists
on that cheeseburger, though.

1009
01:33:35,806 --> 01:33:37,107
I hate that guy.

1010
01:33:37,108 --> 01:33:40,077
Yeah, me, too.

1011
01:33:41,178 --> 01:33:43,113
And you can buy a new car, too.

1012
01:33:43,114 --> 01:33:44,247
I sure can.

1013
01:33:44,248 --> 01:33:45,949
You know what I like?

1014
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:50,153
I like the '64 Chevy
Malibu convertible.

1015
01:33:50,154 --> 01:33:52,756
Why is that?

1016
01:33:52,757 --> 01:33:55,592
I saw it in a movie once.

1017
01:33:55,593 --> 01:33:58,628
I did. It figures.

1018
01:33:58,629 --> 01:33:59,999
A movie once.

1019
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:00,520
A movie once.

1020
01:34:02,133 --> 01:34:05,635
Well, I think we've done
all the damage we can here.

1021
01:34:05,636 --> 01:34:07,704
Let's go blow something up
in L.A., man.

1022
01:34:07,705 --> 01:34:10,607
I'm right behind you.
We ain't got a car.

1023
01:34:10,608 --> 01:34:12,776
Let's just take
this blue Taurus here.

1024
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:14,277
I know how to carjack. Do you?

1025
01:34:14,278 --> 01:34:16,112
Yeah, yeah.

1026
01:34:16,113 --> 01:34:26,113
