319
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,868
I'm so hung over.

320
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,874
ZACH: Yeah, no kidding.

321
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,578
Mmm, oh, God,
get away with that.

322
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,997
ZACH: Come on,
I'll get you some water.

323
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,422
We gotta get up
and catch this plane.

324
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,966
Okay. (GROANS)

325
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,506
Oh.

326
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,842
ZACH: Yeah,
my head is killing me.

327
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,217
Me, too.

328
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,929
Oh, shit. I'm stuck.

329
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,394
(COUGHS) Mmm.

330
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,934
SAMANTHA: How did
we get home last night?

331
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,564
ZACH: I don't know.
The guy in the cab?

332
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,726
Stop. Not right now.

333
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,774
ZACH: See you later,
Santo Domingo.

334
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,610
- Well, we're home.
- Mmm.

335
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,745
ZACH: Home sweet home.
(SAMANTHA SIGHS)

336
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:17,657
ZACH: The honeymoon is over.
( SAMANTHA  SIGHS )

337
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,492
Ooh, wait, wait, wait.

338
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,085
- Hold this.
SAMANTHA: Oh.

339
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,870
ZACH: Oh, sorry.
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

340
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,131
Okay, here we go.

341
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,381
SAMANTHA: All right.
Whoo-hoo!

342
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,004
- (GRUNTS)
(SAMANTHA LAUGHS)

343
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,132
Welcome home,
Mrs. McCall.

344
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,504
(SAMANTHA LAUGHS)

345
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,344
(ZACH GRUNTS)
SAMANTHA: Ugh.

346
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,507
ZACH: Oh.

347
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,600
- Suzie left the door open.
- Great.

348
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,227
ZACH: That's great.

349
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,096
SAMANTHA: Oh.

350
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,980
Yay, home.

351
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,316
Ooh, presents.

352
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,601
Crate and Barrel,
Crate and Barrel.

353
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,769
ZACH: I'll go get the bags.

354
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,151
All right.
We got the panini grill.

355
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,158
And that thing from Allison.

356
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,445
And what is this one?

357
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,871
ZACH: Oh, I don't know.
Open it up.

358
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,872
Mav, do you want
to open this?

359
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,284
- All right.
- He doesn't care.

360
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:06,624
This is the juicer
that I wanted!

361
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:11,511
I'm gonna make so much stuff
with flax and probiotics...

362
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,046
and things with kale.

363
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,887
- Kale?
- Mmm.

364
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,977
(WHISPERING) Kale... kale.

365
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,395
(KAREN LAUGHS)

366
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,314
SAMANTHA: Oh, Mav!

367
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,395
Oh, my God.

368
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,651
SAMANTHA: Look at him.
KAREN: Oh!

369
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,064
Hey, did you see
the "Sold" sign on
the Anderson house?

370
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,200
For real? Maybe
someone will finally
fix that place up.

371
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,860
KAREN: I hope so.
It's terrible.

372
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,154
Your husband,
he can't grill for shit.

373
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,159
ZACH: Sam, come on.
You're gonna miss it.

374
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,992
This will be awesome. Ready?
Just like we practiced.

375
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,540
Are you kidding me?
Come on, Maverick.
No, no, no.

376
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,171
You're supposed
to catch it.

377
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,831
SAMANTHA: Zach.
- Yeah?

378
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,171
ZACH: Come on, ready?
Eye on the prize.

379
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,010
Yes. yes, yes!

380
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,512
SAMANTHA: Zach.
- What?

381
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,258
Can you turn that
off for one second?

382
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,430
Whoa.

383
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,511
What is that?

384
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,937
Uh...

385
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,521
(STAMMERS) it doesn't
make any sense.

386
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,816
I've taken
the pill religiously.
I've never missed one ever.

387
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,276
ZACH: Whoa, whoa, whoa...

388
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,371
You're pregnant?

389
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,374
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

390
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,666
We're having a baby.

391
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,705
- (CHUCKLES)
- Holy shit!

392
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,709
- (SHRIEKS)
- Oh, my God.
That's so amazing.

393
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,881
(LAUGHING)

394
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,013
I feel good
about this office.

395
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,389
- How about you?
- I feel good.

396
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,722
Except that says
three stages of pregnancy,
and there's four pictures.

397
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,388
Okay, so this isn't
a math office.

398
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,601
It's a doctor's office.

399
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,732
(CHUCKLES) I hope that
doctors can do math.

400
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,189
Well, the doctor didn't
make that sign, clearly.

401
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,820
Do you think the doctor made
the "Dirty Area" sign?

402
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,363
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

403
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,735
- Oh, hello.
BOTH: Hi.

404
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,572
Mr. and Mrs. McCall.
Hello, how are you?

405
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,826
I'm Zach.

406
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:00,903
I am Dr. Ludka.

407
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,447
Nice to finally meet.

408
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,873
Yes.

409
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,867
- Hello, lucky lady.
- Hi.

410
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,751
- How are you doing?
- I'm good, how are you?

411
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,412
Okay. You ready?

412
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,747
(INHALES DEEPLY) Yeah.

413
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,548
Okay, this is gonna
be quick and painless.

414
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,707
ZACH: Awesome.
- (CHUCKLES)

415
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,551
- Sorry.
- "Awesome."

416
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,713
You know you get a copy
of the ultrasound, right?

417
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,423
Oh, yeah, I just, um...

418
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,925
This is his thing.

419
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,468
- It's our thing.
- It's our thing.

420
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,605
We just want to film
a bunch of this so he/she,
whoever, can see it later.

421
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,561
- It's for the baby.
- Okay, sure.

422
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,767
- Is it okay?
- Oh, yeah, perfect.

423
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,982
- Okay.
- Make sure you
get my good side.

424
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,317
ZACH: Done. Right there.
SAMANTHA: Both sides.

425
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,737
This is gonna
be a little cold.

426
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,697
(ZACH CHUCKLES)

427
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,529
Mmm-hmm.

428
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,488
- A little gooey, huh?
- Yeah. Oh!

429
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,828
That's great.

430
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,618
Okay.

431
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,621
DR. LUDKA: Ah, there we go.
ZACH: Oh.

432
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,508
Can you see?
There's your uterus,
right there.

433
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,965
And there's the heartbeat.

434
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,633
(DR. LUDKA CHUCKLES)

435
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,305
Huh, um...

436
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,559
ZACH: What?

437
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,013
Oh, don't worry,
I'm just gonna make
a few adjustments.

438
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,522
SAMANTHA: Is it okay?

439
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,192
Uh...

440
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,109
Ah, there we go.

441
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,732
- So, you're about
seven weeks along.
ZACH: Ooh.

442
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,658
And everything
looks really good.

443
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,285
ZACH: Honeymoon baby.
- (CHUCKLES)

444
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,789
The pill is about
99 percent effective,

445
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,992
but, occasionally,
this happens.

446
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,659
Okay.

447
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,165
ZACH: She winked at me.
- I saw that.

448
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,251
- Because I got good sperm.
(DR. LUDKA LAUGHS)

449
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,461
- This is what you started.
- What? It's good,
strong sperm.

450
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,969
DR. LUDKA: I'm gonna
prescribe vitamin B...

451
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,846
- and iron, since
you're a vegetarian.
- Mmm-hmm.

452
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,803
ZACH: Yeah, I've been trying
to break her of that.

453
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,342
- It's for the baby.
- Mmm-hmm.

454
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,101
But, overall,
you're pretty healthy.

455
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,308
I'm expecting a pretty
smooth ride, here.

456
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,814
ZACH: Awesome.
- Great.

457
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,349
- Okay?
ZACH: Thank you.

458
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,108
DR. LUDKA:
One more thing.

459
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,607
ZACH: Ooh.

460
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,279
Congratulations.

461
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,524
The due date is March 30th.

462
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,034
ZACH: Hey,
he looks like you.
- He doesn't!

463
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,615
ZACH: A little jelly bean.

464
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:07,996
Ooh, will you hold this?

465
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,369
DR. LUDKA: (LAUGHS)
Oh, sure.

466
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,205
It's our first family video.

467
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,374
Oh, sweet.

468
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,876
That's awesome.

469
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,541
- Sorry. Thanks.
(ALL LAUGHING)

470
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,628
DR. LUDKA: All right,
I expect you guys back
in five weeks.

471
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,724
ZACH: I think
Maverick drank my wine.

472
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,800
(SAMANTHA CHUCKLES)

473
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,721
Aw, Mav,
he's such a lush.

474
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:36,734
ZACH: Hey, have your
ankles and toes

with the ankles.

Yes, they're swelling up.

477
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,528
I read in the baby book,
it says that those things
swell sometimes.

478
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:47,696
They do.
My entire thing is
swelling right now.

- Oh.
- Does it hurt?

No, I think my body
is being taken
over by hormones.

- Mmm.

Are you sure?

where it came from.

Excuse me.
Is she gonna be back
anytime soon?

She filled me in,
and I've studied your file.

by the time we deliver?

Yeah, can we talk to her?

I don't think
she's gonna be able
to come back.

Let's talk about
your symptoms.

be able to find out
if it's a boy or girl today.

needs a minute.

00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,608
Sorry, the nausea
hasn't really gotten better.

735
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,145
It actually seems like
it's gotten kind of worse.

Well, it's not
entirely unusual.

738
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:19,697
She's been
getting nosebleeds, too.
Are those...?

739
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,911
DR. DYLAN: Yeah, it can be.

740
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,744
She just doesn't seem
like herself lately.

741
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,039
Is there a history
of mental illness
in her family?

742
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,591
Uh, I don't know.

743
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:37,135
She took some meds
during college for anxiety.

I don't really know
what they were.

Um...

We don't really know
anything about her family.

747
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,269
Her parents were killed
in a car crash

748
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,225
and they had to cut
Sam out of her womb.

DR. DYLAN: Um,

755
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,289
I'm gonna do an amnio now,
just to rule out any issues.

Good. I was worried
about you.

it's just a little pressure.
