1
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:33,171
Attention, boils and ghouls,

2
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:37,270
it's time for Dr. Wolfenstein's

3
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:40,214
"Creature Feature Show."

4
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:41,716
Ah-hhh.

5
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:43,342
The doctor is in.

6
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:46,980
Don't scream. Don't move.

7
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:50,082
Stay tuned for Channel 68's

8
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,595
Halloween Eve movie marathon.

9
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:57,363
I'm your host, your ghost host

10
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,096
with the most,
Dr. Wolfenstein.

11
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,297
I will be with you

12
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:06,706
until the end.

13
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,784
Howdy folks.
Black Blood.

14
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:17,820
Violence.
Freaks of Nature.

15
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,855
Come on down to Captain Spaulding's

16
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,857
Museum of Monsters and Madmen.

17
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:24,825
See the Alligator Boy.

18
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:26,657
Ride my famous Murder Ride.

19
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,197
Most of all,
don't forget to take home

20
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:32,428
some of my tasty fried chicken.

21
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,930
It just tastes so damn good.

22
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:57,021
<i>...with a meat cleaver.</i>

23
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:03,059
<i>See it, hear it,
and actually feel it.</i>

24
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:09,362
<i>Coming after you
to rip your flesh apart.</i>

25
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:13,573
<i>Unbelievable but true.</i>

26
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,541
<i>See it, hear it,
and actually feel it.</i>

27
00:02:33,963 --> 00:02:37,592
Shit, I can't do nothin' with this.
I can't get rid of this.

28
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,158
It ain't worth nothin',
my name's all over it.

29
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:42,261
I was fixing it to trade it
to Jackie Cobb.

30
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:45,864
That retard that hangs out
at Molly's Fruit Stand?

31
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:47,910
- Yeah.
- For the life of me

32
00:02:47,977 --> 00:02:50,036
I cannot understand why
you hang out with that asshole.

33
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:51,944
He's one horny retard.

34
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:54,448
Well, ain't they all?
All they wanna do is eat and fuck.

35
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:57,577
If you knew him,
you might understand his urges.

36
00:02:57,653 --> 00:03:00,349
Worse than a rabid-ass baboon.

37
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:04,120
You know what his favorite thing is
next to whacking his weasel?

38
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:06,161
He takes a sharpened pencil

39
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,356
and sticks it in his eyeball
and twists it.

40
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:10,399
- What?
- He doesn't hurt himself though,

41
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:13,299
he kind of twists it
right next to his eyeball.

42
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:16,964
He'd been putting that pencil
someplace other than his eyeball.

43
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,497
He don't do nothin' like that.
Although, once he got caught

44
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,739
with a "Planet of the Apes" doll
stuck up his asshole.

45
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,178
Goddamn.

46
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,241
They had to take him
to the hospital.

47
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:32,253
Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck
halfway up his butt.

48
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,481
Couldn't get it out.

49
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:47,967
- Did you fix the toilet?
- Yes, I did,

50
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:51,495
and I don't want you stuffing any
goddamn paper towels down there.

51
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:53,906
I had to snake
the shit out that thing.

52
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:56,274
Here you go.

53
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:59,314
You bust that crapper
and I'm gonna bust your ass.

54
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:00,906
I hear ya.

55
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,494
Mary, fucking Moses,
ya'll get the fuck outta here.

56
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:25,268
Hold it, clowney.
Keep your paws where I can see them.

57
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:27,832
Don't move.
I'll blast a hole the size of

58
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,641
a Kansas City watermelon
through your ugly ass, Bozo face.

59
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:33,841
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

60
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,611
Go grab that other asshole
out of the shitter

61
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:38,176
- and drag his ass back in here.
- Right.

62
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:43,823
You miserable motherfu...
I ought to jump over this counter

63
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:45,861
and bash your fucking balls in.

64
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:48,590
Alright, Tippy,
hand over the cash box

65
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,690
and I might leave
your brains inside your skull.

66
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,065
I'll tell you what, Ski King,

67
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:56,604
why don't you just take
your mama home some chicken

68
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,539
and then I won't have to stuff
my boot all up in ya ass!

69
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,543
I don't like chicken!

70
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:03,374
And I hate clowns!

71
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:13,786
Put that shit down.
Put it down!

72
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:18,858
That is it!

73
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:22,364
I'm gonna count to 10 and you're
gonna hand over all the cash,

74
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:24,558
or I'm gonna splatter
your grease-paint mug

75
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,397
across the state line.

76
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,562
- One...
- Fuck yo mama.

77
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:30,572
- Two...
- Fuck yo sister.

78
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,232
What are we gonna do?

79
00:05:32,308 --> 00:05:34,105
I know you, you work
at the hardware store, right?

80
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,235
- Richard Wick, right?
- Shut your trap.

81
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:38,371
Quiet down, both of you!

82
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:40,347
- Three...
- Fuck yo grandma.

83
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,509
I remember now.
All the guys made fun of you.

84
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:45,486
- Called you Little Dick Wick.
- Shut up!

85
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,358
Stop singing, I hate that song.

86
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:53,861
Put your fucking mask back on.

87
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,532
Fuck it!

88
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:21,919
Most of all, fuck you!

89
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,319
<i>Goddamn motherfucker got
blood all over my best clown suit.</i>

90
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,149
How many want
to touch this afternoon?

91
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,242
Raise your hand if you want
God to touch you.

92
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,915
I'm gonna pray that God
will give you a divine touch...

93
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,516
...the US Department of Agriculture

94
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:40,755
is checking whether
state meat and poultry inspectors

95
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,765
are good enough to allow the
product to go on sale nationally.

96
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,266
The USDA has said...

97
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:47,427
Man, some of these
Manson chicks are really hot.

98
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:49,801
Shit, how are we
almost out of gas?

99
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:52,363
And this squeaky, right here,
now that's a girl you would date.

100
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:55,842
- Jerry, how much did you put in?
- I don't know? Two, three bucks.

101
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,038
Two, three bucks?
I told you to fill...

102
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:01,777
- Bill, feel me, am I made of money?
- Get off. Jesus Christ, Jerry.

103
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:05,048
Don't panic yourself there
way too much, caffeine guy.

104
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:07,146
I wouldn't be drinking
so much coffee

105
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:09,191
if you did your share
of the driving.

106
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,089
- You know I don't have nightvision.
- Oh, not this again.

107
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,253
Seriously, I can't even make out
the lines in the road.

108
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:15,297
If you wanna pull the car over,
I'll be more than happy

109
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:16,956
to kill us out
in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:19,899
Besides, there's a billboard
right there.

111
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:21,903
Captain Spaulding's Museum
of Monsters and Madmen.

112
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:24,064
Awesome, great!
Fried chicken and gasoline.

113
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,574
Next exit, there you go,
problem solved

114
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:29,839
and we didn't have to freak out.
It was a real big deal.

115
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,142
Dick.

116
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,079
Alright.

117
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:41,521
I'll pump the gas. Go inside
and see if it's worth checking out.

118
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,218
Okay, Mr. Cranky.

119
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:49,089
Holy...crap!

120
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:51,292
You gotta see this place.
It's boss.

121
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,335
- How boss?
- Really fucking boss.

122
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:55,563
Like, wake up the chicks
and break out the camera boss?

123
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,037
Hell, yeah.

124
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:06,146
Wakey, wakey!
Eggs and bacon.

125
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:08,183
Hey, sweetie, come on.

126
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,218
Grab Mary and get your stuff
and come on inside.

127
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:13,153
Bill and I found a kick-ass place.
Come on, move, move!

128
00:10:18,694 --> 00:10:20,685
Let's go.

129
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:23,129
Come on, Sleeping Beauty,
it's time to go to work.

130
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,335
What's in that case over there?

131
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:39,847
Hairless monkey.

132
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:42,816
Did you see the crocodile boy?

133
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,251
How'd you like to find
that in your pants?

134
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:50,816
- Excuse me, sir? Howdy.
- Hi.

135
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:53,885
I love this place. How long have
you been running this place?

136
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:57,160
Well, uhm...
How long's a piece of string?

137
00:10:58,701 --> 00:10:59,895
I don't know.

138
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,904
Too goddamn long,
that's how long.

139
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:05,668
Too goddamn long, that's right.

140
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,403
Right, I hear that,
but how long, actually?

141
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:11,708
Oh, shit, I don't know exactly.

142
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,739
I took over for my pa,
right after the Duke damned Oscar.

143
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:18,082
- Oh, you mean John Wayne.
- Hell, son.

144
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:20,246
How many dukes do you know about?

145
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:22,882
- Greatest American ever lived.
- Look at that.

146
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,552
"Circle up the wagons, pilgrims."

147
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:27,562
"Whatever you say, cowboy."

148
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:31,594
I'm not that much of a Western fan.

149
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,362
I like science-fiction.

150
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:35,369
Ah-hhh. Space boy.

151
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:39,635
I figured as much.

152
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,676
Let me ask you something.

153
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:45,077
How come you're asking
so many jackassy questions?

154
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:47,115
My friends and I,
we're driving across country

155
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:50,618
writing this book on off-beat
roadside attractions,

156
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:53,553
the crazy shit you see when
you're driving across the country.

157
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:56,682
I don't drive cross country.

158
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,727
But if you did.

159
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:00,091
But I don't.

160
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:04,292
Yeah, but supposing
for a second that you did.

161
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,298
You little dickens, you.

162
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:11,498
I know what your problem is.

163
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:13,234
What's that?

164
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:16,335
Ya'll think us folks from the
country's funny-like, don't you?

165
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:18,505
- Jerry...
- Well, saddle up the mule, ma.

166
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,947
Slide me some grits,
I's got to get me some education.

167
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:24,417
- Jerry...
- You asshole.

168
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:27,080
No, I'm really very interested,
I'm not trying to make fun.

169
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,989
Gotcha!

170
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:35,121
You are such a bad clown.

171
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:36,960
Oh, fuck me, Side Sally,

172
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:40,195
who the hell'd wanna read about
all this horseshit anyway?

173
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:41,668
You'd be surprised.

174
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:44,262
Son, look around.

175
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,433
Would I be surprised?

176
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:53,581
Finally. Great, great. Come on, we
paid for the tickets.

177
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,674
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.
- What tickets?

178
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,845
This isn't everything.
There is actually a murder ride.

179
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:01,788
A murder ride?
I don't want to go on a murder ride.

180
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,654
- Yes, you do wanna go on a...
- No, I don't.

181
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,456
Hey, how about
if we skip the murder ride?

182
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:08,291
Hey, how about if we go?

183
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:11,561
Anytime this year, people.
Tour is about to begin.

184
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,931
Okay, we'll see you inside
the murder ride, we'll be back. Bye.

185
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,733
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

186
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,363
children of all ages,

187
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,638
you are about to enter
the world of darkness,

188
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:25,976
a world where life
and death are meaningless,

189
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:29,074
and pain is God.

190
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:31,745
- Pain!
- Billy, let's go.

191
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,881
- Quit that, sport.
- Sorry, Captain Spaulding.

192
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:41,027
We gonna have a good time now.

193
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:43,257
On your right, you will see

194
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:48,167
the infamous
Albert...Fish.

195
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:52,702
Masochist, sadist,

196
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:55,744
child killer and most importantly,

197
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:57,335
cannibal.

198
00:13:57,413 --> 00:14:01,247
Mr. Fish, born 1870
and enjoyed spankings

199
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:03,375
with nail-studded paddles,

200
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:06,615
stuffing needles
deep into his groin.

201
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:10,454
- I have a question. How many...
- Hold all questions.

202
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:16,091
No, no, help.

203
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:23,766
Lizzie fucking Borden.

204
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,899
Now, one of our most famous crazies,

205
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:30,741
the psycho of Plainsfield,
Mr. Ed Gein.

206
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:32,576
Murderer, cannibal,

207
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:34,843
Mr. Gein used to take
great pleasure

208
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:39,217
of playing with
dead bodies of women,

209
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:43,122
especially, their sexual organs.

210
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:04,075
Now, one of our local heroes,

211
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:05,773
S. Quentin Quale,

212
00:15:05,848 --> 00:15:09,011
aka Dr. Satan.

213
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:11,018
Oh shit!

214
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:16,251
Murderer, torturer,
but most of all, master surgeon.

215
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:18,293
Mr. Quail was an intern

216
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,420
at Willows County Mental Hospital,

217
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:23,465
nicknamed Weeping Willows

218
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:26,501
for the never-ending cries of pain.

219
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:28,866
Through primitive brain surgery...

220
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:30,905
- Jerry, stop it.
- Mr. Quail believed

221
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,908
that he could create
a race of superhumans

222
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,534
from the mentally ill.

223
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:37,977
Vigilante justice prevailed.

224
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,911
They took his ass out and hung him.

225
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,947
And that infamous hanging tree

226
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:46,112
is no more than a stone's throw away

227
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:48,520
from where y'alls' ass
is now seated.

228
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,620
But the next day

229
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:55,822
his body was found
to be missing.

230
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:57,866
Until today

231
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:00,595
no trace of Dr. Satan

232
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,637
has ever been discovered.

233
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:06,432
But then, who knows?

234
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:12,478
Maybe he lives next door to you.

235
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,843
Tour's over.
Exit through the doors.

236
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:23,584
That was so bad-ass.

237
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:26,924
Dr. Satan. Ah-hhh,
Dr. Satan.

238
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:31,198
Maybe he lives next door to you.

239
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:33,791
Calm down, it was alright.

240
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,736
Do you think maybe we could go now?

241
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:39,171
I'm gonna go call my dad.
I'll be right back.

242
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:42,267
I love you.

243
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:43,777
What do you mean,
it was alright?

244
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:46,109
It was cool,
but it wasn't that great.

245
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:49,014
Dude, you don't have to play it
down in front of your chick.

246
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,075
- Oh.
- Thank you.

247
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:05,593
Don't move a muscle, an artery,

248
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,329
Or a vein.

249
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,405
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

250
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:12,940
- Wow, Denise.
- We stopped for gas

251
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:15,875
at this place
called Captain Spaulding's,

252
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:18,913
somewhere outside of Ruggsville.

253
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:22,917
It turned into this whole big thing,
so we're behind schedule.

254
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,282
Don't be too late.

255
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:28,119
I forgot to tell you that Halloween
falls on a school night

256
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,057
so they're
trick-or-treating tonight.

257
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,588
Your left hand shows your past;

258
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:38,030
your right hand shows your future.

259
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:44,472
Good evening.
I'm Lance Brockwell

260
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:48,031
and this is the 7:00 news.
And our top story tonight,

261
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,874
investigators still have no leads
to the strange disappearance

262
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:53,710
of the five cheerleaders
from Ruggsville High School.

263
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,773
Cindy Thompson, Karen Murphy,

264
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:59,048
Allison Cole, Valarie Green,
and Dawn Baker

265
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,919
were last seen four days ago
leaving a football game.

266
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:05,090
I know it seems stupid,
but I really wanna see this tree.

267
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,526
Do yourself a favor, son,
just forget about it.

268
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:10,224
Oh, come on,
I live for this shit.

269
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,927
Okay, alright,
I'll draw you a damn map.

270
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:15,993
- Thank you.
- I still say it's a waste of time.

271
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:19,234
You are here.
Go straight up this road.

272
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:21,503
Make the first right.
First left.

273
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:23,601
Come straight across and down.

274
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,647
Can't find it? Tough.

275
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:27,511
- Here's your map.
- Right on.

276
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:29,550
- Here's your complimentary chicken.
- Oh, wow.

277
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:31,882
Don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

278
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:33,978
You're gonna get
a great write-up for this.

279
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:49,737
Here's an idea, let's just skip it.
It's probably nothing anyway.

280
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:53,138
Christ, Jerry, Bill is right,
we can't see anything.

281
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,368
What's that?

282
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,068
Hitchhiker.

283
00:18:58,146 --> 00:19:01,138
- What? Should we stop?
- We can't leave her in the rain.

284
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:03,810
Stick her in the front
if you wanna pick her up so bad.

285
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:09,552
So, uh,

286
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:12,422
- where ya headed?
- I was just going home.

287
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:15,088
- Home, where's that?
- A couple miles up the road.

288
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:17,723
- So, you live around here?
- Yeah.

289
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,892
Do you know where
this Dr. Satan tree's at?

290
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:22,493
Yeah. You know where that's at?
It's right by my house.

291
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:24,402
- I can show you.
- Really?

292
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:27,169
- So, it is a real thing.
- Fuck you.

293
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:30,507
So, a tree?
Where's it at?

294
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:33,070
- What tree?
- Okay, this is crazy.

295
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:35,116
She obviously doesn't
know anything.

296
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:37,344
Oh, I know,
I'll show you where it's at.

297
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:41,321
Whatever you need to do, you do it.

298
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,288
There is no wrong.

299
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:46,453
If someone needs to be killed,
you kill 'em.

300
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:49,088
That's the way.

301
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,313
Fuck.

302
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:08,645
I think we blew a tire.

303
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:15,154
- Oh poop.
- Oh, hell.

304
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,852
At least we got that spare.

305
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,792
You filled it up
like I asked, right?

306
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:22,352
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:26,566
Okay, what if I forgot
to put it back in the trunk?

308
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:28,660
What would plan B entail?

309
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:32,434
- Jesus Christ, Jerry.
- Technically I did what you said.

310
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,975
Oh for fucking sake, Jerry,
what're we gonna do now?

311
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:37,773
I can't rightly
say if I know, me ladies.

312
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:39,677
Wait, I love this song.

313
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:45,415
Would you turn
the radio off, please?!

314
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,318
God!

315
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:49,289
We can walk to my house from here.

316
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:50,085
What?

317
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:53,127
My brother's got a tow truck.
He can come get your car.

318
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,425
- I'll go, it's my fault.
- Forget it, I'm going.

319
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:57,522
- No, Bill, I...
- You guys stay here.

320
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,362
There's no sense in everyone
getting drenched.

321
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,971
Returning to the news,
local authorities still have no lead

322
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,008
in the mysterious disappearance
of the five cheerleaders

323
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:08,872
from Ruggsville.
The girls were last seen

324
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:11,674
leaving a cheering competition...

325
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:13,043
It was loud enough
to wake the dead.

326
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,547
That's an idea.
What is?

327
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:18,552
Wouldn't it be dramatic? Supposing
the people inside were dead,

328
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,147
all stretched out with the lights
quietly burning about them.

329
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:24,317
I'm sure it would be very amusing.

330
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:28,226
Why you ask?
Why is not the question.

331
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:30,093
How?

332
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:33,396
Now, that is a question
worth examining.

333
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:35,936
How could I,

334
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,495
being born of such

335
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:40,666
conventional stock,

336
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:42,835
arrive a leader of the rebellion?

337
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:47,041
An escapist from a conformist world,
destined to find happiness

338
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:50,016
only in that which
cannot be explained.

339
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,451
I brought you here for a reason.

340
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:56,048
But unfortunately,
you and your sentimental minds

341
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:57,716
are doing me no good.

342
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,761
My brain is frozen,

343
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:02,456
locked.

344
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,522
I have to break free

345
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:08,592
from this culture
of mechanical reproductions

346
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,104
and the thick incrustations

347
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:12,901
dying on the surface.

348
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:14,942
Oh, Christ.

349
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:17,906
Fuck it.

350
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:36,760
These are all my dolls.

351
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:38,799
I used to chop their heads off
and their arms

352
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,801
and stick them up on the wall.

353
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:45,762
The door's locked,
I gotta go around.

354
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,638
Just wait here.

355
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:08,854
Jesus Christ!
Don't do that.

356
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,127
You scared the shit out of me.

357
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,930
You ain't seen nothing yet.

358
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:17,870
- Is your brother ready to go?
- Yeah, he already left.

359
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:20,305
- Come on, inside.
- What? He left?

360
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,967
Come on and get toasty.

361
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,909
Don't worry about it, he's fine.

362
00:23:28,984 --> 00:23:31,282
I just don't understand why...

363
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:35,514
What was that?

364
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:40,058
What? I didn't hear anything.

365
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,096
Turn the radio off.

366
00:23:42,163 --> 00:23:43,960
Now listen.

367
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:51,171
I still don't hear anything.

368
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:54,174
I swear to God,
I heard some weird...

369
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:57,268
Turn on the headlights,
see if something's out there.

370
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,549
Calm down, calm down.

371
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:12,455
Jesus H. Christ.

372
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:14,893
It's the fucking tow truck guy.

373
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,310
So,

374
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:30,742
you live alone here?

375
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:34,009
I mean,
just you and your brother?

376
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:36,676
Nah, there's a bunch of us
around somewhere.

377
00:24:36,751 --> 00:24:39,652
I think Otis is upstairs
messing around or something.

378
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,198
You gotta have the marshmallows.

379
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:53,894
That's what makes it fun.

380
00:24:53,968 --> 00:24:56,163
Yeah, I guess.

381
00:24:56,237 --> 00:24:58,797
You sure do a lot of guessing.

382
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,340
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

383
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:07,237
Wow.

384
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:09,283
Look at him.

385
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,251
He must've been going pretty fast
to smash through that wall.

386
00:25:15,423 --> 00:25:17,823
You sure are silly
for a guy with glasses.

387
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,053
- I like that.
- Okay, hey.

388
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,359
Need those to see, thank you.

389
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:25,456
How do I look?

390
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:27,501
Terrific, really.

391
00:25:31,606 --> 00:25:33,506
Tasty.

392
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,567
Ain't the only thing
tasty in this house.

393
00:25:51,226 --> 00:25:53,990
Okay, okay.

394
00:25:54,062 --> 00:25:56,030
I wonder what time...

395
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:58,327
- it's getting kind of late.
- Don't worry, sugar.

396
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:00,924
It ain't past my bedtime

397
00:26:01,002 --> 00:26:03,095
Are you flirting with me?

398
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:04,729
What? Oh, no.

399
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:11,406
Great! They're back.

400
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:13,379
Whoppie-fucking-do.

401
00:26:18,153 --> 00:26:20,417
Excuse me?

402
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,550
I gotta call my dad
and tell him we're gonna be late.

403
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,561
Can I use your phone, please?

404
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:28,561
Hello?

405
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,655
Ain't got one.

406
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,500
- Oh, hi.
- Goodness.

407
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:38,495
You really don't have a phone?

408
00:26:41,242 --> 00:26:42,504
No.

409
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:47,780
I once had one back in '57,

410
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:49,680
but...

411
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:55,216
I don't quite remember.
There's nobody round here.

412
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,818
I feel like jaw-flapping at no more.

413
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:03,091
Do you think the guy with the tow
truck could drive us to a phone?

414
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:06,395
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr.

415
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:09,630
But we all call him

416
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:13,697
- RJ.
- Makes sense.

417
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:16,903
What do they call you, sweetie?

418
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:19,469
I am Qualsnarg of the Crab Nebula.

419
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,478
But you humans can call me Jerry.

420
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:27,145
Jerry.

421
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,850
Baby, go on and see how RJ's doin'
with these nice folks' automobile.

422
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:39,425
Why don't you just all make
yourselves to home?

423
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,894
What brings you kids way out here?

424
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:46,702
Haven't you got something better
to do on Halloween

425
00:27:46,774 --> 00:27:48,708
than wander around
out in the sticks?

426
00:27:48,776 --> 00:27:50,801
I thought maybe
we'd take in a hoedown.

427
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:56,148
No, he's just joking.

428
00:27:57,452 --> 00:28:00,910
- You are?
- I'm sorry, I'm messing with you.

429
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:04,049
Shut up, dude.

430
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,990
Oh, I get it.

431
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:09,622
Y'all just think you're too good

432
00:28:09,697 --> 00:28:11,790
for the simple pleasures
of Halloween.

433
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:15,927
No, just a little too old.

434
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:19,440
Oh really? I hope something
changes your mind

435
00:28:19,507 --> 00:28:21,407
someday.

436
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:26,312
- Mama, Tiny's home.
- What about RJ?

437
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:28,110
He was gone before I seen him.

438
00:28:28,182 --> 00:28:31,549
But Tiny saw him and said he said
he was going down to the yard

439
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:33,780
to get a new wheel.

440
00:28:33,855 --> 00:28:36,153
How long is that gonna take?

441
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,954
Probably be back
in a couple of hours.

442
00:28:39,027 --> 00:28:41,723
A couple of hours? What?

443
00:28:41,796 --> 00:28:43,855
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?

444
00:28:48,703 --> 00:28:50,637
Tiny ain't got no car,

445
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:52,866
he ain't even got a bicycle.

446
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:58,570
Even though I know
that you think it is childish,

447
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:02,377
tonight is Halloween Eve,

448
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,974
and to us

449
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:06,919
it is special.

450
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:11,425
So you are all invited to dinner.

451
00:29:17,532 --> 00:29:20,126
I hope to Christ she don't expect
us to wear these things.

452
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:21,862
What ever it is, just do it.

453
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:24,496
The more we play along the faster
we'll get the hell out of here.

454
00:29:24,572 --> 00:29:27,598
Now is not the time to make waves.
Jerry.

455
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:30,128
You'll have to forgive Tiny.

456
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:32,365
He can't hear so much.

457
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:36,742
That poor baby.

458
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:39,780
It's his daddy's fault.

459
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:42,611
Earl wasn't a bad man,

460
00:30:42,683 --> 00:30:44,480
he never hit me
or nothing like that.

461
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:47,749
One day he just up
and went devil on us all.

462
00:30:47,822 --> 00:30:52,020
- What happened?
- He tried to burn down the house.

463
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:55,187
He said it was
possessed by the spirits.

464
00:30:55,263 --> 00:30:59,324
And Tiny was sleeping in the
basement where the fire started.

465
00:31:02,203 --> 00:31:05,468
But I don't think Earl
ever meant to harm us.

466
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:09,742
Tiny was badly burnt,
his ears were destroyed

467
00:31:09,811 --> 00:31:12,279
and most of his skin.

468
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:16,009
- Is that why he wears the mask?
- Yeah.

469
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,780
My baby boy gets
shy around new people,

470
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:22,721
but he'll warm up to you,

471
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,951
especially the girls.

472
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:30,387
He's a real lady-killer.

473
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:44,007
You're gonna miss
a good show tonight.

474
00:31:44,078 --> 00:31:46,069
That's your tough luck.

475
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,945
I thought you kids
were all about team spirit.

476
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:52,645
You ain't done fuck-all
to cheer me up since you got here.

477
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,813
Give me a B. Give me an A.

478
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:57,357
Give me a B. Give me a Y.

479
00:31:57,425 --> 00:32:00,952
What's that spell?
What's that spell?!

480
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:03,895
What's that spell?!

481
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,626
Baby.

482
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,861
You're damn right.

483
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:29,182
Okay now.
Everybody put on your masks.

484
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:33,819
Can't very well eat our desserts
with our everyday faces exposed.

485
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:35,453
Can we?

486
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,966
Gosh, kid, put it on.

487
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:43,359
She ain't gonna let
any of us touch dessert

488
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:46,406
unless you're wearing
this damn thing.

489
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:52,812
Mrs. Firefly?

490
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,849
Do you know anything
about the legend of Dr. Satan?

491
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:57,908
- Here we go.
- Shut up.

492
00:33:02,423 --> 00:33:05,221
I'm not much for gossip
and this and that,

493
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:07,261
- but I have heard...
- I know all about

494
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,489
what you wanna know all about.

495
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:11,259
Otis.

496
00:33:11,332 --> 00:33:13,425
I can't believe you decided

497
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:15,992
to come down and join us.

498
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:26,237
And you brought Little Wolf.

499
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:28,282
Oh, my baby.

500
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:32,212
Oh my God.

501
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:36,179
It's such a special night for me.

502
00:33:39,093 --> 00:33:41,789
I don't know

503
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:45,263
who told you your fairy fables
about Dr. Satan.

504
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,631
We heard it from a Captain Spaulding

505
00:33:47,702 --> 00:33:48,691
up the road at...

506
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:50,896
That old bitch hog don't know shit.

507
00:33:50,972 --> 00:33:54,408
Tells this cute little tattle-tales
to sell his junk,

508
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:57,467
but he don't sell
no Yankee boys no truth.

509
00:33:57,545 --> 00:34:00,105
Something happened, right? It had
to be based on some real incident.

510
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:03,947
Are you, Jimmy Olsen,
cub reporter for the Daily Asshole?

511
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:07,784
- Grampa, watch your language.
- I don't think you need to know.

512
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:10,247
Better you leave here
with your head still full

513
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:12,986
of kitty cats and puppy dogs.

514
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,929
- I really would like to know...
- Hey, he'd really like to know.

515
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:19,830
Enlighten him.

516
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,064
I bet you'd stick your head in fire
if I told ya you could see hell.

517
00:34:24,138 --> 00:34:26,231
Meanwhile, you're too stupid
to realize

518
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,332
you got a demon
sticking out your ass

519
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:31,401
singing, "Holy Miss Moley,"

520
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:34,380
"Got me a live one."

521
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,478
Can we change the subject, please?

522
00:34:40,721 --> 00:34:41,915
Dinner's over.

523
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:46,326
Ladies and germs,

524
00:34:46,394 --> 00:34:48,487
it's show time!

525
00:35:00,274 --> 00:35:01,605
Tell you a little story...

526
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:03,974
Eat your wife's pussy...

527
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:07,446
I mean jam your face in it!

528
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:11,345
...starts licking and chomping
on her pussy

529
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:13,614
and she's screamin'
and yellin' and she just...

530
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:15,280
Ah-hhh!

531
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:18,848
The old battleaxe at home's
liable to crush my balls!

532
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:23,293
Would you be quiet?

533
00:35:23,364 --> 00:35:26,231
You're gonna wake up grandma.

534
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:32,501
Bravo, man.

535
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:35,201
Hey, hey, hey, don't be moving now,
don't be moving.

536
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:38,677
We got something real special
for you men out there.

537
00:35:56,263 --> 00:35:59,721
Wow!

538
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:54,146
Jerry.

539
00:36:56,624 --> 00:37:00,355
Get off him.

540
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:04,762
I said get the fuck off him,
you stupid fucking whore!

541
00:37:04,832 --> 00:37:07,300
- Fucking slut!
- You shouldn't have done that.

542
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:09,336
Oh, really? Are you gonna
do something about it?

543
00:37:09,403 --> 00:37:11,166
- I'll do something, motherfucker.
- Yeah, come on.

544
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:13,729
I'll fucking cut your tits off
and shove them down your throat.

545
00:37:13,808 --> 00:37:15,742
- Baby, stop!
- Come on, Ma,

546
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,005
- this bitch has got it coming.
- No, I told you, remember?

547
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,108
- Car's done.
- Thank God.

548
00:37:23,184 --> 00:37:25,345
I suggest that you kids leave.

549
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:27,444
We're gone.

550
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:31,282
Fuck you!

551
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:36,124
- I love you, Mama.
- I know.

552
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:44,304
Lock the fucking doors!
Hurry up.

553
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:46,339
Jesus Christ, you think she
was really gonna cut you.

554
00:37:46,407 --> 00:37:49,171
Of course she was gonna cut me,
she's a fucking nut.

555
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:54,445
I knew she was crazy from
the second we picked her up.

556
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:56,540
Okay. That's that.

557
00:37:56,617 --> 00:37:59,518
Let's get out
of this fucking nuthouse.

558
00:38:11,098 --> 00:38:13,760
What're you doing?
Why are you stopping?

559
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,132
- I gotta open the gate!
- For Christ's sake, hurry up!

560
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:27,305
Oh, shit!

561
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:48,292
Somebody help him!

562
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:56,065
Oh shit!
What are they doing to him?

563
00:38:58,445 --> 00:39:00,879
Who's that?

564
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:02,813
Oh my God!

565
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:11,024
Shut the fucking door!
Oh, no!

566
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,710
Somebody help us!

567
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:38,251
Oh my God! Get away from us!

568
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,254
No, please.

569
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,792
Oh my God!

570
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:47,292
No-ooo!

571
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:48,919
Oh my God!

572
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:55,368
Help me! Help me!

573
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,429
<i>...rock and roll this morning
with some Led Zeppelin...</i>

574
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,338
<i>...kinda wild around
the radio station today,</i>

575
00:40:32,406 --> 00:40:33,805
<i>it being a holiday.</i>

576
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:36,135
<i>It's kinda like
a ghost town around here.</i>

577
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:39,402
<i>It's kinda nice though,
it's kinda kick back.</i>

578
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,448
<i>Maybe time to get away with stuff.</i>

579
00:40:49,223 --> 00:40:50,656
Huston.

580
00:40:50,724 --> 00:40:53,784
<i>Donald Willis.</i>

581
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:56,557
- Don Willis, how the hell are you?
<i>- Listen, Frank,</i>

582
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,928
I'm a little worried about Denise.

583
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,627
She called me last night
from the road near Ruggsville,

584
00:41:01,702 --> 00:41:04,500
a place called Spaulding's.

585
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:06,539
<i>Yeah, I know the joint.</i>

586
00:41:06,607 --> 00:41:09,838
She said she'd be here about 11:00,
but she never showed up.

587
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,879
I'll run a check on up there
by Spaulding's

588
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:15,915
and see if there's any accidents,
or road closings.

589
00:41:15,983 --> 00:41:19,043
It was raining like
a son of a bitch here last night.

590
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,246
They're probably just stuck
in the mud someplace.

591
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:45,271
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

592
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:48,712
I said, shut your fucking mouth!

593
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:56,122
Listen, you Malibu middleclass
Barbie piece of shit,

594
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,782
I'm trying to work here!

595
00:41:57,858 --> 00:42:00,588
Work! You ever work?

596
00:42:00,661 --> 00:42:02,424
Yeah, I'll bet you have.

597
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:05,522
Scooping ice cream to your shitheel
friends on summer break.

598
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,727
I ain't talking about
no goddamn white socks

599
00:42:08,802 --> 00:42:11,896
with Mickey Mouse on one side
and Donald Duck on the other.

600
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:14,440
I ain't readin'
no funny books, Mama.

601
00:42:14,508 --> 00:42:18,444
Our bodies come and go,
but this blood is forever.

602
00:42:21,615 --> 00:42:22,980
I'm gonna remove your gag,

603
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,850
but if you make so much
as a fucking peep

604
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,353
I'm gonna cut you like a pig

605
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:31,550
and make you eat your own
fucking intestines. You got me?

606
00:42:42,736 --> 00:42:45,933
Why are you doing this to me?

607
00:42:46,006 --> 00:42:49,567
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

608
00:42:49,643 --> 00:42:51,076
Messy up your day?

609
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:53,670
Where's Bill?

610
00:42:53,747 --> 00:42:56,409
- Where's Bill?
- Bill?

611
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:58,781
Is he okay?

612
00:42:58,852 --> 00:43:00,183
He's a good guy.

613
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:04,850
He's been a great help to me.
A real blessin'.

614
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:08,656
I couldn't have asked
for a better specimen.

615
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:11,387
You don't know

616
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:13,831
what kind of dry spell I've had,

617
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:16,461
total block, total block.

618
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:20,603
But Bill,

619
00:43:20,674 --> 00:43:22,471
he's okay.

620
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:25,911
Where is he?

621
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:50,970
Hi.

622
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:31,271
Where is he?
Can I see him?

623
00:44:31,345 --> 00:44:33,711
Can I see Bill, please?

624
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,873
Let's go see.

625
00:44:38,852 --> 00:44:41,719
Behold...

626
00:44:41,788 --> 00:44:44,222
- Fish-boy!
- Oh my God!

627
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:46,589
Oh my God, Bill.

628
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,924
No, no, this can't be real.
This can't be real.

629
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:51,760
This can't be real,
this can't be real.

630
00:44:51,832 --> 00:44:53,766
Oh, it's real.

631
00:44:53,834 --> 00:44:56,200
Real as I want it to be, Mama.

632
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,642
Fuck you, you fucking freak!

633
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:31,998
Well...

634
00:45:32,072 --> 00:45:34,472
Let's see if the nut that runs
this place can help us.

635
00:45:37,077 --> 00:45:39,671
Take a look at all this crap.

636
00:45:39,746 --> 00:45:43,204
I'd red flag anybody
running a joint like this.

637
00:45:44,418 --> 00:45:46,784
Sweet baby Jesus.

638
00:45:46,853 --> 00:45:49,651
Whoever's jerking off on that bell
better be gone when I come out,

639
00:45:49,723 --> 00:45:52,419
or I'm gonna rip your nuts off.

640
00:45:54,161 --> 00:45:57,597
Officers, officers,
what can I do for you?

641
00:45:57,664 --> 00:45:58,926
I ain't fired up the birds yet

642
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,990
if that's what you've been
ring-a-ding-dinging about.

643
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:04,504
I need you to answer some questions
about some missing kids.

644
00:46:04,571 --> 00:46:06,129
Oh, I don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

645
00:46:06,206 --> 00:46:08,834
I'm the kind of guy that
just minds his own business,

646
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:10,467
if you get what I'm saying.

647
00:46:10,544 --> 00:46:13,809
You seen this girl?
Say in the last 24 hours?

648
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:17,950
Yeah, yeah, a cute kid.

649
00:46:18,018 --> 00:46:19,986
Ain't my type though.

650
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:22,544
I like 'em with a little
more meat on 'em.

651
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:25,853
The bigger the cushion,
the sweeter the pushin'.

652
00:46:29,262 --> 00:46:31,230
Look, clown-ass,
just answer the damn question.

653
00:46:31,298 --> 00:46:32,959
We ain't interested
in your love life, alright?

654
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:35,467
Cut the crap, Spaulding
and get with the facts.

655
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:36,627
Huh?

656
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:39,831
What did you see?
Who was she with?

657
00:46:39,906 --> 00:46:41,874
- Where was she going?
- I don't know.

658
00:46:41,942 --> 00:46:44,604
She was with some stupid kids.
They's nosing around,

659
00:46:44,678 --> 00:46:46,703
asking a bunch
of stupid questions.

660
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,748
- Questions about what?
- I don't know.

661
00:46:48,815 --> 00:46:53,411
This and that. Mostly a bunch
of tired Dr. Satan bullshit.

662
00:46:54,454 --> 00:46:56,445
They caught a gander
at the display in the back

663
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:57,990
and they figured
they's gonna run out

664
00:46:58,058 --> 00:47:00,322
and solve
the great Deadwood mystery.

665
00:47:00,394 --> 00:47:02,157
And how'd they get that idea?

666
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:04,424
I wrote 'em a map.

667
00:47:04,498 --> 00:47:06,693
Out to the old farm road.

668
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:08,735
I figured, what the hell?
It wouldn't do no harm.

669
00:47:08,802 --> 00:47:11,566
'Sides, it's good
for my tourist trade.

670
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:15,267
You can shit 10 bricks
for all I care.

671
00:47:16,777 --> 00:47:18,404
What else?

672
00:47:19,246 --> 00:47:21,146
Nothin'.

673
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:23,614
Stupid-ass kids probably
got themselves

674
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:26,880
turned around ass-backwards
and got theyself lost.

675
00:47:26,953 --> 00:47:31,356
Is that all? And I want you
to think real hard.

676
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:38,463
Well, I don't rightly know.

677
00:47:38,532 --> 00:47:40,500
They wasn't here
long enough for me

678
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,558
to get up close
and personal with 'em,

679
00:47:42,636 --> 00:47:45,935
like I do most assholes
that come wandering in here.

680
00:47:46,006 --> 00:47:49,100
How about you write them same
directions out for me then?

681
00:47:49,176 --> 00:47:52,475
Alright, alright. Don't get all
"True Grit" on my ass.

682
00:47:52,546 --> 00:47:55,174
You can knock yourself
silly for all I care.

683
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,716
Enough talk!
Write.

684
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:03,745
I don't know where
that skunk ape sleeps.

685
00:48:03,824 --> 00:48:07,954
All I know is, that he had
impure relations with my wife.

686
00:48:09,196 --> 00:48:13,599
That's true, he performed lurid
acts upon me and my person.

687
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:15,601
Hold up the picture.

688
00:48:15,669 --> 00:48:17,500
I'm gonna kill that skunk ape.

689
00:50:08,415 --> 00:50:11,316
Please, Tiny.
Please let me go.

690
00:50:12,786 --> 00:50:14,754
Let me go.
Help me.

691
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:18,621
Please, God, please.

692
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,052
Thank you.
Thank you.

693
00:50:28,935 --> 00:50:30,926
I'm just gonna go now.

694
00:50:31,004 --> 00:50:34,167
I'm just gonna go home.

695
00:50:34,241 --> 00:50:36,675
I'm just gonna go home now.

696
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:40,208
I'm just gonna go home now.

697
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,408
I'm just gonna go now.

698
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:51,018
I'm just going home now.

699
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,753
Where the fuck do you think
you're getting to?

700
00:50:53,827 --> 00:50:55,795
No, no, no...

701
00:51:01,534 --> 00:51:03,764
Playtime is over.

702
00:51:26,993 --> 00:51:29,291
It matches.

703
00:51:29,362 --> 00:51:31,421
Call it in.

704
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:33,796
- I think we found 'em.
- Yeah.

705
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,744
Hey, poopie pants.
What's new?

706
00:51:50,216 --> 00:51:52,582
Where the fuck is Bill? Where's
Denise? You can't keep us here.

707
00:51:52,652 --> 00:51:55,348
Shut up!

708
00:51:55,422 --> 00:51:57,822
Wanna play a guessing game?

709
00:51:59,626 --> 00:52:02,527
Guess what number I'm thinking of.

710
00:52:02,595 --> 00:52:04,688
Eat shit and die.

711
00:52:08,635 --> 00:52:11,103
No, wait, please. Come on, stop it.
What do you want from me?

712
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,571
- What do you want from...
- Be quiet. I don't wanna slip.

713
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:20,470
Okay, one more.

714
00:52:20,547 --> 00:52:23,380
You get this right,
I'll let you go.

715
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,876
If you get it wrong,
you are fucked!

716
00:52:26,953 --> 00:52:29,979
Who's my favorite movie star?

717
00:52:30,056 --> 00:52:32,388
I don't know.

718
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:34,586
Marilyn Monroe.

719
00:52:35,795 --> 00:52:39,253
No, Betty Davis.
Sorry, you lose!

720
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,924
Ah-hhh!

721
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:47,865
Jesus, somebody
had themselves a field day

722
00:52:47,941 --> 00:52:49,909
beating the shit out this thing,
didn't they?

723
00:52:49,976 --> 00:52:52,240
Yeah.

724
00:52:52,312 --> 00:52:54,906
No mercy shown here.

725
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:57,541
Didn't find any bodies, did ya?

726
00:52:57,617 --> 00:53:01,713
- Not yet.
- Holy Christ.

727
00:53:01,788 --> 00:53:05,053
What could these kids have done
to bring this much hell down on 'em?

728
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:07,423
- I found something.
- What's that?

729
00:53:07,494 --> 00:53:08,461
Keys.

730
00:53:08,528 --> 00:53:11,429
Don't stand there like some
prize dog, Dick, open the trunk.

731
00:53:11,498 --> 00:53:13,762
- Yes, sir.
- Toss them here.

732
00:53:18,371 --> 00:53:21,534
- Oh, Goddamn.
- You got something, Georgie?

733
00:53:21,608 --> 00:53:22,939
Yeah.

734
00:53:23,276 --> 00:53:24,573
We found something.

735
00:53:24,644 --> 00:53:26,874
People come, people go,

736
00:53:26,946 --> 00:53:28,641
but how many ever stop
to take a look

737
00:53:28,715 --> 00:53:31,946
at the underbelly of the beast?

738
00:53:32,018 --> 00:53:35,112
I make 'em stop
and I make 'em look.

739
00:53:35,188 --> 00:53:37,782
Hope you like what you see.

740
00:53:37,857 --> 00:53:40,155
Hope you like what you see!

741
00:53:40,226 --> 00:53:44,219
Just hold it a minute, Grandpa.

742
00:53:44,297 --> 00:53:46,993
<i>At a time
like this, you're taking pictures?</i>

743
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:49,034
<i>I just couldn't help it.</i>

744
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:51,593
<i>You look so natural
sitting in that box.</i>

745
00:53:51,671 --> 00:53:56,267
Put me behind the wheel of that
bitch, I'll show you drivin'.

746
00:53:56,342 --> 00:54:01,177
You useless fuck. You couldn't
even get your big ass in that seat.

747
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:03,374
You ungrateful...

748
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,283
Don't start with me, Hugo.

749
00:54:11,724 --> 00:54:14,420
Get off the damn car,
this ain't your living room.

750
00:54:14,494 --> 00:54:16,826
Goddamn grease monkey.

751
00:54:19,532 --> 00:54:22,228
You sure this guy is supposed
to ride with us...in this car?

752
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:23,792
Mm-hmm.

753
00:54:26,272 --> 00:54:28,240
This doesn't seem right to me.

754
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:32,039
It ain't up to us, Chief said pick
him up and take him with us.

755
00:54:32,111 --> 00:54:34,477
Guy's an ex-cop,
figures he can be of some help.

756
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:37,482
I just hope he doesn't
get in my way, is all I'm sayin'.

757
00:54:44,757 --> 00:54:46,554
This must be him.

758
00:54:49,128 --> 00:54:51,460
- Mr. Willis?
- Yes, sir.

759
00:54:51,531 --> 00:54:54,125
- I'm Wydell, this is Nash.
- How you doin', sir?

760
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,192
Donald Willis.
Any leads?

761
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,465
We were on our way out
to check on a couple of farms

762
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:00,938
out on the edge of town.

763
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:02,872
That's about our only lead
up to this point.

764
00:55:02,942 --> 00:55:05,035
What about this body you found?

765
00:55:05,111 --> 00:55:07,136
You know about that?

766
00:55:07,213 --> 00:55:09,340
Local girl.
Karen Murphy.

767
00:55:09,415 --> 00:55:12,316
One of the cheerleaders
that went missing last week.

768
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:13,352
That's it?

769
00:55:13,419 --> 00:55:15,387
We know the kids
were on their way out

770
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,150
to a place the locals
call Deadwood.

771
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:20,021
They wanted to play Nancy Drew
with this local legend

772
00:55:20,093 --> 00:55:21,685
people call Dr. Satan.

773
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:24,093
- This is insane.
- Don't you worry about it.

774
00:55:24,163 --> 00:55:25,721
We'll find her, alright?

775
00:55:29,669 --> 00:55:32,297
My name is Lewis Dover

776
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:36,035
and I'm no rich man,
but I know the truth.

777
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:38,077
You don't have to go to hell.

778
00:55:38,144 --> 00:55:40,704
You're in hell...this is hell.

779
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,248
This is hell.
This is hell.

780
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:24,945
I'm gonna see if anybody's home.
You and Mr. Willis

781
00:56:25,024 --> 00:56:27,515
check around,
see if you see anything.

782
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:28,856
Come with me.

783
00:56:37,637 --> 00:56:40,105
I hate fucked up families!

784
00:56:40,173 --> 00:56:42,471
- It's just a dip.
- Otis!

785
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:45,443
Otis, come quick.
There's cops out there.

786
00:56:45,511 --> 00:56:47,502
- What? Damn!
- How many?

787
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:50,640
- Don't worry about it.
- I don't know. I only saw one.

788
00:56:50,717 --> 00:56:53,481
Fucking pigs always travel in packs.

789
00:56:53,553 --> 00:56:55,521
- Take this.
- What should I do?

790
00:56:55,588 --> 00:56:57,988
Go downstairs and play nice.

791
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:03,889
I'll go round back and take control
like I always fucking do.

792
00:57:06,332 --> 00:57:08,197
Goddamn.

793
00:57:08,267 --> 00:57:11,031
These packrats throw anything away?

794
00:57:11,104 --> 00:57:14,437
- I don't think so.
- Hold this thing.

795
00:57:14,507 --> 00:57:18,466
Hello? Hello?

796
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:25,714
You'd think these son of bitches
would have a yard sale, don't you?

797
00:57:25,785 --> 00:57:27,184
Yeah.

798
00:57:29,122 --> 00:57:31,454
Hello?

799
00:57:31,524 --> 00:57:33,856
Oh my God!

800
00:57:33,926 --> 00:57:36,759
- Oh my God!
- Calm down, Barney!

801
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:38,797
Don't even start
with that "Mayberry" shit.

802
00:57:38,865 --> 00:57:39,832
It's only a dog.

803
00:57:39,899 --> 00:57:41,799
I was bit by a cocker spaniel
when I was eight years old.

804
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:46,304
- Hello, Officer.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

805
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:48,670
I'm Lieutenant Wydell. I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

806
00:57:48,741 --> 00:57:52,871
Why, heck, I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

807
00:57:52,945 --> 00:57:54,913
I appreciate the cooperation, ma'am.

808
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:56,380
I'm looking for a missing girl.

809
00:57:56,449 --> 00:57:59,646
I'm serious. It was a big
cocker spaniel...big teeth.

810
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:02,347
It was my ex-girlfriend's.
Almost bit off my pinky toe.

811
00:58:02,422 --> 00:58:04,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

812
00:58:04,457 --> 00:58:06,425
Shh, you hear that?

813
00:58:06,492 --> 00:58:07,459
Yeah.

814
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,654
Yeah, I hear it. Where do
you think it's coming from?

815
00:58:09,729 --> 00:58:12,197
Out this way.

816
00:58:12,265 --> 00:58:14,961
Alright, hold on,
hold on one second here.

817
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,626
Hey, hey!

818
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,694
Sheriff's Department, open up.

819
00:58:18,771 --> 00:58:21,968
- No, I ain't seen her, sorry.
- Ma'am...

820
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,804
If I could just
come in for a minute.

821
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,538
I have some other pictures
I'd like you to look at.

822
00:58:26,612 --> 00:58:28,910
It might stir something up.

823
00:58:28,981 --> 00:58:30,972
No. I don't think so.

824
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,677
Ma'am.

825
00:58:32,752 --> 00:58:34,879
It'll only take a minute.

826
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,186
Oh, alright.

827
00:58:41,461 --> 00:58:44,191
I guess I can trust you,

828
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:46,060
being a man of the law.

829
00:58:46,132 --> 00:58:48,532
Yes, ma'am.

830
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:49,932
Thank you, ma'am.

831
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:21,997
Oh, this one looks familiar.
Is he on the TV?

832
00:59:22,068 --> 00:59:24,764
No, ma'am,
I don't believe he is.

833
00:59:28,374 --> 00:59:29,432
- Wydell?
- Excuse me, ma'am.

834
00:59:29,509 --> 00:59:32,239
- Wydell, over! Wydell, over!
- Wydell, over.

835
01:02:04,463 --> 01:02:07,728
Let me take a guess here.
Y'all havin' a Halloween Party.

836
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,791
What makes you think that,
big boy?

837
01:02:09,869 --> 01:02:13,566
You sure are buying a whole mess
of holy water for two people.

838
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:16,472
We like to get fucked up
and do fucked up shit.

839
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:19,477
- You know what I mean?
- I like to get fucked up too.

840
01:02:19,545 --> 01:02:22,673
- Do some fucked up shit.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

841
01:02:22,748 --> 01:02:25,717
How much we owe ya, goober?

842
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:29,414
Actually it's G. Ober,
for Gerry Ober,

843
01:02:29,488 --> 01:02:32,980
but the new guy, Romald in the back,
he drew in that other O

844
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:35,584
and made Goober.
Fucking asshole.

845
01:02:35,661 --> 01:02:38,152
Great story, Goober.
How much we owe ya?

846
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:41,131
The damage is quite severe.

847
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,260
- $185.
- That ain't gonna break my bank.

848
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:48,773
Here, keep the change and go
get yourself a new name, Goober.

849
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:51,435
Holy dog, I will, thank you.

850
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:56,243
You all drive safe. Thanks for
comin' in to Red Hot Pussy Liquor.

851
01:03:24,377 --> 01:03:26,675
Where's Otis? Where's Otis?

852
01:03:26,746 --> 01:03:28,907
He's comin'. He's got
something real special this year.

853
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:31,415
Otis, Otis, Otis...

854
01:04:03,482 --> 01:04:07,441
I'm the one who brings
the Christmas candy.

855
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,488
Now tell me,

856
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:11,523
who's your daddy?

857
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:17,689
I'm the one who brings
the devil's brandy.

858
01:04:17,763 --> 01:04:19,560
Who's your daddy?!

859
01:04:23,969 --> 01:04:26,529
I'm the one who beats you
when you're bad.

860
01:04:26,605 --> 01:04:30,371
- Who's your Daddy?!
- Who's your Daddy?!

861
01:04:37,483 --> 01:04:41,146
Come on, sweetie,
give the old man some sugar.

862
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:47,390
Daddy, Daddy.

863
01:04:50,396 --> 01:04:52,523
And I'm the one who loves ya

864
01:04:52,598 --> 01:04:54,190
when you're fucking dead.

865
01:04:55,634 --> 01:04:58,660
Who's your Daddy?!
Who's your Daddy?!

866
01:04:58,737 --> 01:05:01,399
Well, I say my little darlings.

867
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:05,241
Maybe it ain't a good idea to be
prancing around

868
01:05:05,311 --> 01:05:06,972
where you don't belong.

869
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:11,380
And you,
the great rusher of fools,

870
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,281
what was it that you were after?

871
01:05:13,352 --> 01:05:16,788
Come on, speak to me, boy.
I remember now.

872
01:05:16,856 --> 01:05:18,483
Dr. Satan.

873
01:05:18,557 --> 01:05:21,458
Goddamn it, everybody
got to know about Dr. Satan.

874
01:05:21,527 --> 01:05:24,018
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna do you a favor.

875
01:05:24,096 --> 01:05:26,189
I'm gonna let you
meet the old bastard.

876
01:05:28,567 --> 01:05:30,194
It's all true.

877
01:05:30,269 --> 01:05:33,864
The bogeyman is real
and you found him.

878
01:05:33,939 --> 01:05:37,238
<i>And you found him...</i>

879
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:41,867
Hey, happy boy,
step your ass up here.

880
01:06:42,908 --> 01:06:45,843
Take his gag out.
It's more fun with the screaming.

881
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:50,109
I like that too. That screaming
is much more exciting that way.

882
01:06:53,786 --> 01:06:55,845
Please don't kill us,
please don't kill us.

883
01:06:55,921 --> 01:06:57,912
Please don't kill us...
nah...please don't kill us.

884
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:01,289
Shut your mouth
and get your shit in the box.

885
01:07:03,529 --> 01:07:06,828
- Get in now.
- Wait, wait, wait...

886
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:09,060
I wanna say goodbye.

887
01:07:19,378 --> 01:07:20,902
Goodbye, sweetie.

888
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:23,847
We could've been great.

889
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:26,043
Just let us go, I swear to God
we won't tell anyone.

890
01:07:26,118 --> 01:07:30,555
- I swear...
- Honey, you know I can't do that.

891
01:07:31,824 --> 01:07:34,384
I swear to God,
we won't tell. I swear to God.

892
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,223
Ain't we just having a fucking hoot?

893
01:07:36,295 --> 01:07:38,354
Get your fucking ass up, boy.

894
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:41,422
Come on, we ain't got all night.

895
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,968
Where does she think
she's gonna run to?

896
01:07:44,036 --> 01:07:47,472
- She gonna run all the way home?
- No, let me get her.

897
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:48,938
Alright, go get her.

898
01:07:52,211 --> 01:07:56,170
Huntin' humans,
ain't nothin' but nothin'.

899
01:07:56,248 --> 01:07:58,716
They all run like
scared little rabbits.

900
01:08:01,487 --> 01:08:02,545
Run, rabbit, run.

901
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:05,121
Run, rabbit.

902
01:08:06,492 --> 01:08:08,790
Run, rabbit. Run, rabbit.

903
01:08:10,195 --> 01:08:11,787
Run, rabbit, run!

904
01:08:13,032 --> 01:08:14,226
Run, rabbit!

905
01:08:20,005 --> 01:08:21,973
<i>There once was a woman</i>

906
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:25,272
<i>who lived with her daughter
in a cabbage garden.</i>

907
01:08:25,344 --> 01:08:29,007
<i>Along came a rabbit
and ate up all the cabbages.</i>

908
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:32,983
<i>The woman said, "Go into the garden
and drive out the rabbit. "</i>

909
01:08:33,052 --> 01:08:35,247
<i>Mary.</i>

910
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:38,222
<i>Told you.
I'm gonna get you.</i>

911
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:40,349
<i>Mary.</i>

912
01:08:40,426 --> 01:08:41,950
<i>Mary...</i>

913
01:08:42,027 --> 01:08:45,861
<i>I'm gonna get you.
I'm coming to get you.</i>

914
01:09:16,829 --> 01:09:19,627
"Shoo, shoo," said the maiden.

915
01:09:24,336 --> 01:09:26,896
"Come, maiden," said the rabbit.

916
01:09:26,972 --> 01:09:31,068
"Sit on my tail and go with me
to my rabbit hutch."

917
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:43,349
No-ooo, no!

918
01:09:43,422 --> 01:09:47,415
No hanky-panky.
Rufus, put the lid on.

919
01:09:47,493 --> 01:09:49,518
No-ooo!

920
01:09:50,929 --> 01:09:53,295
No-ooo!

921
01:10:02,007 --> 01:10:03,406
Oh, no!

922
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:14,380
No!

923
01:10:14,453 --> 01:10:18,287
No, no, no!

924
01:10:18,357 --> 01:10:21,053
Stop! No!

925
01:10:32,704 --> 01:10:34,433
No!

926
01:10:42,748 --> 01:10:44,511
No-ooo!

927
01:10:46,685 --> 01:10:49,552
No, no-ooo!

928
01:11:13,278 --> 01:11:16,941
Bury me in a nameless grave.

929
01:11:26,892 --> 01:11:30,089
Bury me in a nameless grave.

930
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:33,996
Jerry, wake up, wake...

931
01:11:34,066 --> 01:11:35,624
Jerry, wake up, wake up, wake up.

932
01:11:40,606 --> 01:11:44,667
Bury me in a nameless grave.

933
01:11:54,253 --> 01:11:58,417
Bury me in a nameless grave.

934
01:12:02,394 --> 01:12:04,828
Oh my God!

935
01:12:18,744 --> 01:12:21,872
- No-ooo!
- Jerry!

936
01:12:21,947 --> 01:12:24,973
No, Jerry!

937
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:45,603
<i>Please! Help!</i>

938
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,439
<i>Help me!</i>

939
01:12:53,178 --> 01:12:55,703
<i>I can't see anything!</i>

940
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,041
Jerry? Is that you?

941
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:06,520
Jerry?

942
01:13:06,592 --> 01:13:10,892
Jerry? Thank God.

943
01:13:25,911 --> 01:13:27,970
Please help me.

944
01:14:52,064 --> 01:14:53,827
God!

945
01:17:01,059 --> 01:17:02,390
Jerry?

946
01:17:04,196 --> 01:17:08,462
Oh, God, no, no, no...

947
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:10,296
No!

948
01:17:23,949 --> 01:17:25,507
No-ooo!

949
01:17:25,584 --> 01:17:27,950
No!

950
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,317
God, no, no.

951
01:17:30,388 --> 01:17:32,083
No, no!

952
01:17:35,727 --> 01:17:36,921
No-ooo!

953
01:20:14,886 --> 01:20:16,410
Go away!

954
01:20:19,924 --> 01:20:22,154
Go away!

955
01:23:39,524 --> 01:23:42,618
Sweet baby Jesus, girl.
What the hell happened to you?

956
01:23:42,694 --> 01:23:45,561
I got away.

957
01:23:48,032 --> 01:23:50,000
I recognize you.

958
01:23:50,068 --> 01:23:52,798
There's a whole bunch of people
been looking for your ass.

959
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:56,203
- I gotta get to a doctor.
- Alright, alright.

960
01:23:56,274 --> 01:23:58,242
Just sit back and relax.

961
01:23:58,309 --> 01:24:00,539
I'll get you to a doctor.

962
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:06,216
Come on...that's it,
that's it.

963
01:24:06,284 --> 01:24:08,844
I'll get you there, yeah, yeah.

964
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:49,220
