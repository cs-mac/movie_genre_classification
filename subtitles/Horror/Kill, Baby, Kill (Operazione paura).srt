2
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,450
I thought you'd never get back.

3
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,570
There was a heck of a crowd on the piste.

4
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,410
So I see.

5
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,460
- Mission accomplished?
- Best Beluga.

6
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,090
Vodka - rather shaken - and one microchip.

7
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,580
Good. I'll make a signal to M.

8
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,590
Be a good girl, would you,
and put her on automatic.

9
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,140
And we could do with a couple of glasses.

10
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,610
They're in the overhead rack.

11
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,320
Commander Bond!

12
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,820
Call me James. It's five days to Alaska.

13
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:15,700
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!

51
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,230
- Thank goodness you're here, James.
- That's very nice, Moneypenny.

52
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,310
A little over the top for the office?

53
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,360
I've been trying to reach you all morning.
What have you been up to?

54
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,150
Rest and recreation, my darling.

55
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,530
The trip back from Siberia
took a lot out of me.

56
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,490
Your dedication when you're on the job
is most commendable, James.

57
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,960
<i>Omit the customary pleasantries,
Miss Moneypenny. We're pressed for time.</i>

58
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,500
I'll... fill you in later, Moneypenny.

59
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,870
Aahh!

60
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,140
- Minister.
- Commander.

61
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,340
Good morning, sir.

62
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,600
A new pet, Q?

63
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,100
If, 007, you'd ever bothered to read
any memos sent from my department,

64
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,940
you would realise this is a prototype
of a sophisticated surveillance machine.

65
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,610
Now we're all here
you can get on with the briefing, Q.

66
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,780
Very good, sir.

67
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,110
Gentlemen...

68
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,240
A silicon integrated circuit:

69
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,950
the essential part of all modern computers.

70
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,120
No lecture, Q.
We're all aware of the microchip.

71
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,330
Until recently, all microchips
were susceptible to damage

72
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,340
from the intense magnetic pulse
of a nuclear explosion.

73
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,720
- Magnetic pulse?
- Yes, Minister.

74
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,970
One burst in outer space over the UK
and everything with a microchip in it,

75
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:25,440
from the modern toaster to sophisticated
computers and our defense systems,

76
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,650
would be rendered useless.

77
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,440
We'd be paralyzed - at the Russians' mercy.

78
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,990
That is why a private defense
contractor came up with this:

79
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,820
a chip totally impervious
to magnetic pulse damage.

80
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,410
Now - if I place it on the micro-comparator

81
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,160
and compare it with
the chip Bond recovered

82
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,250
from the body of 003 in Siberia...

83
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,970
- When I bring the two images together...
- They're identical.

84
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,560
The KGB must have a pipeline
into that research company.

85
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,260
It would appear so.

86
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,600
Six months ago that company was
acquired by an Anglo-French combine:

87
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,480
Zorin Industries.

88
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,850
There has been a security
check of the plant?

89
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,980
A very extensive one. But we have no leads.

90
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,280
What about Zorin himself?

91
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,200
Max Zorin? impossible.
He's a leading French industrialist.

92
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,450
A staunch anti-communist with
influential friends in the government.

93
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,660
With due respect, Minister,

94
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,630
the leak did occur
after Zorin bought the company.

95
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,330
Precisely why I've initiated an investigation.

96
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,210
All right, but let's be discreet about it.

97
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,630
But of course, Minister.

98
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,300
You have exactly 35 minutes
to get properly dressed, 007.

99
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:51,360
<i>They round the turn.
Just under a mile to race from this point.</i>

100
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,900
Come on, Fluke! Move your Ar...

101
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,160
- Who is number one? The Grey with him?
- Oh, that's Pegasus. Zorin's horse.

102
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,950
With the cane. Max Zorin?

103
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:09,080
Yes. Born in Dresden.
Fled from East Germany in the sixties.

104
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,500
French passport.
Speaks at least five languages, no accent.

105
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,750
Now the talk of the City and the stock Exchange.

106
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,220
- The old rags-to-riches story.
- Made his first fortune in oil and gas.

107
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,810
Now a second in electronics and hi-tech.

108
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,430
Who's that with him under the hat?
With the red dress. A girlfriend?

109
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,020
Oh.

110
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,570
We're not sure about her.

111
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,230
American. She's never far from him.
Name's May Day.

112
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,400
And dressed for the occasion.

113
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,530
Come on, Fluke!
Get a wiggle on!

114
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,950
<i>Pegasus has come from
nowhere, and as they go for the line</i>

115
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,090
<i>it's Pegasus who storms clear
off Fluke and Cooper Girl.</i>

116
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,640
<i>First, number one; second,
number two; and third, number five.</i>

117
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,480
<i>First number one, Pegasus;
second number two, Fluke;</i>

118
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,940
<i>and third number five, Cooper Girl.</i>

119
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,280
Unbelievable! In all my years as a trainer

120
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,950
I've never seen a horse
run such a fast last furlong.

121
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,620
Sir Godfrey Tibbett. Our department.

122
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,750
- Many congratulations.
- Thank you.

123
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,970
- Lucky man, Zorin.
- Could be more than luck, Admiral.

124
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,210
- Fixed?
- Your guess is as good <i>as</i> mine.

125
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,300
The French Jockey Club have hired
a detective, Aubergine, to look into it.

126
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,600
Easy, Pegasus.

127
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,520
Calm down, Pegasus.

128
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,150
Easy. Steady, steady.

129
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,400
She must take a lot of vitamins.

130
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,830
Perhaps Pegasus does too.

131
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,950
I think I should meet with
this detective friend of yours.

132
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,750
Yes. Might have some interesting
information for us. Set it up, David.

133
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,300
Right you are.

134
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,670
Moneypenny - be a darling, would you,
and collect that for me.

135
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,510
- I'll buy you dinner when we get back.
- Pegasus!

136
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,360
Bollinger, '75.

137
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,700
I see you are a connoisseur, Monsieur Bond.

138
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,160
<i>- Then, Lafite Rothschild '59.
- Another excellent choice.</i>

139
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,870
I'm pleased you approve -
since you're paying the bill.

140
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,870
- Cheers.
- Santé, Monsieur Aubergine.

141
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,930
The Sureté has no information on Zorin
before he came over from East Germany?

142
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,800
Through a personal connection
I saw his dossier myself.

143
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,980
But even Sureté records
are sometimes incomplete!

144
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,060
<i>Et voici</i> maintenant the fabulous
Dominique and the enchanted papillons!

145
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,850
Perhaps we should add this
butterfly to our collection, no?

146
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:06,200
Tell me, why do Zorin's horses
beat others with superior bloodlines?

147
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,240
This is a mystery.

148
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,610
- Could he be using drugs?
- Nothing showed up in the tests.

149
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Later this month, Zorin will hold his
annual sales at his stud near Paris.

150
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,880
Security is formidable
but the key to this mystery is there.

151
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,850
And I, Achille Aubergine, intend to find it.

152
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,680
Uunnhh!

153
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,650
<i>- Qu'est-Ce qu'il y a?
- There's a fly in his soup.</i>

154
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,830
<i>Pardonnez-moi, monsieur.</i>

155
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,850
- Taxi!
- <i>Je Ne suis pas en service</i>

156
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,470
- Follow that parachute.
- Crazy English!

157
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,800
Out.

158
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,730
MY car!

159
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,610
My car! Ohh!

160
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,010
<i>Sens unique, fada!</i>

161
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,810
Congratulations.

162
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,080
So?

163
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,090
This operation was to be
conducted discreetly.

164
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,760
It took six million francs
in damages and penalties

165
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,100
for violating most of the Napoleonic Code.

166
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,060
Under the circumstances it was
more important to identify the assassin.

167
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,720
What did you learn from Aubergine
before his demise?

168
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,530
Only that Zorin is having a thoroughbred
sale at his stud not far from here.

169
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,230
I should be there.

170
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,320
- Can you help me, Sir Godfrey?
- I may be able to arrange an invitation.

171
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,280
It's a bit short notice...
but I might just be able to squeeze you in.

172
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,360
Thank you.

173
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,250
Sir Godfrey, your hat.

174
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,270
Mr St John Smith?

175
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,650
SIN-jun Smythe, my dear.

176
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,610
- My name is Scarpine. Head of security.
- How do you do.

177
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,610
- We have a room for you at the chateau.
- Oh, splendid.

178
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,200
By the way, the preview is in progress
at the main stables.

179
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,000
- Is that it?
- No, no, those are the servants' quarters.

180
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,960
The stables are over here.

181
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,790
Let me escort you there.

182
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,480
- Catalogue of the sales.
- Thank you.

183
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,230
Tell me - the lthacus colt. Is it here?

184
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,030
- You mean the full brother of Pegasus?
- Yes.

185
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,020
He's the outstanding horse of the sales.

186
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,900
He'll be shown last. We expect him
to fetch over three million dollars.

187
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,330
Sounds quite reasonable.

188
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,540
If you need any further assistance
please call me.

189
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,710
Thank you.

190
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,630
Steady! Steady, Pegasus, steady.

191
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,520
Keep him on a tight rein!

192
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,060
Steady now, Pegasus. Steady.

193
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,660
<i>- J'arrive dans un instant.
- Dépêche-toi.</i>

194
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,340
<i>We are now very proud to
present the full brother of Pegasus.</i>

195
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,760
<i>This colt is born in the purple.</i>

196
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,500
<i>Monsieur Smythe.</i>

197
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,130
Monsieur Zorin has been detained.

198
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,470
He's anxious to meet you at the
reception in the chateau gardens later.

199
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,090
I look forward to it.

200
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,100
- I wish you wouldn't keep wandering off.
- I'm sorry, sir.

201
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,560
Your driver may stay
in the servants' quarters.

202
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,940
I'm sure that'll be more than adequate.
What do you say, Tibbett?

203
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,110
Ahem!

204
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,710
- Welcome, sir. I'm Jenny Flex.
- Of course you are.

205
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,940
- I'll call a porter.
- Oh, no need. My man'll take care of it.

206
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,110
- Let me show you to your room.
- Thank you.

207
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,280
When you're ready, Tibbett.

208
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,870
Well, my dear, I take it you spend
a lot of time in the saddle.

209
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,660
- Yes, I love an early morning ride.
- I'm an early riser myself.

210
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,950
Come along, Tibbett. Stop wheezing.

211
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,600
Whew!

212
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Don't stand there panting, Tibbett.
Start unpacking.

213
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,980
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

214
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,990
- The reception is at six.
- Thank you, my dear.

215
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,330
Well, you heard what Miss Jenny Flex
said: there is a reception at six.

216
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,130
- Yes, sir.
- So I need a white jacket and a black tie.

217
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,800
Yes, sir.

218
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,170
- And if possible, a clean shirt.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,930
Oh, my Lord, Tibbett!
Look at the state of my clothes.

220
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,850
- How on earth do you pack my bags?
- Sorry, sir.

221
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,640
Mr Faras told his trainer
he'll go to a million for the lthacus colt.

222
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,150
- Good. Anything from St John Smythe?
- Nothing about the sale, sir.

223
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,200
<i>- But I'd hate to be his valet.
- You'll have to buck up your ideas.</i>

224
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,370
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't be so damned obsequious.

225
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,710
<i>Oh, my Lord.
What the devil's wrong with these shoes?</i>

226
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,010
<i>- Were they wiped over with an oily rag?
- Terribly sorry, sir.</i>

227
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,930
<i>You blasted well should be</i>

228
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,590
<i>I don't know how long
you expect to remain in my employ...</i>

229
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,900
- Well done, my good man.
- Must we keep this up when we're alone?

230
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,150
A successful cover becomes
almost second nature.

231
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,020
What's all this about Pegasus disappearing?

232
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,700
One minute he's in his stall-
the next, neither hide nor hair of him.

233
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,520
We should look into it.

234
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,330
Well, don't you concern yourself with that.

235
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,380
There's the man I saw at the Pegasus stable.

236
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,570
- Another wealthy owner?
- Who knows?

237
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,240
- But she'd bear closer inspection.
- We're on a mission.

238
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:07,660
Sir Godfrey, on a mission
I am expected to sacrifice myself.

239
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,120
Lovely pa"!!-

240
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,700
Enjoying our little party,
Monsieur... St John Smythe?

241
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,370
Immensely, immensely. SIN-jun Smythe.

242
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,450
Looks as though you'll have
a good turnout for the sale tomorrow.

243
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,150
May I introduce Miss Sutton?
Sheik Farouk.

244
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,560
- Welcome.
- Mr Zorin. Main Strike all set?

245
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,990
We'll know after the 22nd.

246
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,690
- Thank you.
- Enjoy yourself.

247
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,330
You were looking for something?

248
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,330
Yes, I... I was looking for the bar.

249
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,670
Come. I will show you.

250
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:12,300
Oh, by the way, the name is
St John Smythe. James St John Smythe.

251
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,480
Dr Carl Mortner. At your service.

252
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,150
- Hiya, doc!
- Good afternoon, Mr Conley.

253
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,690
Mr Conley, Mr Smythe.

254
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,110
Bob Conley.

255
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,370
- Are you a trainer?
- Horses? Hell, I can't even ride.

256
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,410
- I'm in the oil business.
- Oh. Texas?

257
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,080
Frisco. I handle Mr Zorin's
oil interests there.

258
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:39,540
Would you excuse us? Come on, honey.

259
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,620
Are you a doctor of medicine?

260
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,460
Oh, no, no.
I am Mr Zorin's breeding consultant.

261
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,970
Oh, really?
Then you can let me into a little secret.

262
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:56,550
How is it you succeed with breeding
bloodlines other experts think inferior?

263
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,600
Selective breeding is important.

264
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,230
But more important
is conditioning and a desire, ja?

265
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,690
Are you talking about
people or horses?

266
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,650
My principles apply equally
to human beings.

267
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,610
Mr St John Smythe.
Allow me to introduce myself.

268
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,410
Mr Zorin, it's a great pleasure.

269
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,410
- A groom asked if you'd go to the stables.
- Of course.

270
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,540
You will excuse me?

271
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,010
I must congratulate you, Mr Zorin.
Your stables are magnificent.

272
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,560
Built in the 16th century by a duke who
believed he'd be reincarnated as a horse.

273
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,680
Have thoroughbreds interested you long?

274
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,190
Oh, no. As a matter of fact I had a dotty
old aunt die and leave me some stables.

275
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,060
So I thought it might be rather fun
to breed and raise horses.

276
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:48,070
- I take it you ride?
- I'm happiest in the saddle.

277
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,690
A fellow-sportsman.

278
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,240
What about fishing?

279
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,740
Fly casting?

280
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:02,540
I'm neglecting my other guests. You'll find
the young ladies stimulating company.

281
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,460
I'm sure they are.

282
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:22,190
Hello. I thought you might
like to join the party.

283
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,650
By the way, the name is
James St John Smythe. I'm English.

284
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,190
Hmm. I never would have guessed.

285
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,570
Really?

286
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,150
<i>Monsieur.</i>

287
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,660
Well, are you buying or selling?

288
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,120
- Selling?
- Horses.

289
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:43,950
Oh.

290
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,010
No, I'm not interested in horses.

291
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,680
Well, you came to the wrong place,
didn't you?

292
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,840
May Day.

293
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,010
Get her away from him.

294
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,310
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.

295
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,520
Have Security keep a good eye on him.

296
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,690
You didn't say what part
of the States you come from, Miss...

297
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,150
No. I didn't.

298
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,440
I suppose you... travel a lot?

299
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,240
Your helicopter leaves in 20 minutes.

300
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,710
You're not staying the night? I was hoping
we'd spend the evening together.

301
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,330
Now I shall be all alone.

302
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,210
I doubt that.

303
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:31,130
- Well, let me walk you to the chopper.
- That won't be necessary.

304
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:36,050
- Someone will take care of you.
- You'll see to that personally, will you?

305
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,000
Shhh!

306
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,960
Are you looking for this?

307
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,130
Quite <i>a</i> letdown.

308
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,550
- St John Smythe?
- Sleeping like a baby.

309
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,370
That's a boy.

310
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,580
There we are.

311
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,350
It's interesting. He's had surgery.

312
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,740
Surgery? That is how Zorin won the race.

313
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,700
Mortner implanted one of
these microchips into Pegasus.

314
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,620
You see, these microchips are
programmed to control an injection

315
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,290
of additional natural horse steroids.

316
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,750
- To overcome fatigue during the race.
- How?

317
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,500
The injection itself, with that small needle,

318
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,000
is triggered by a remote-control transmitter

319
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,550
small enough to fit into
the tip of a jockey's whip

320
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,390
OF 8 cane.

321
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,420
The lights!

322
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,750
There's a world surplus of microchips
and Zorin is hoarding them!

323
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,520
<i>- Dis donc, on va voir ce qui Se passe?
- D'accord.</i>

324
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:40,020
- I'm afraid I wasn't much help.
- Don't worry. It's all wrapped up.

325
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,290
Keep your guard up higher.
And retain your balance.

326
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,940
- Aiiii!
- Oof!

327
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,560
- What now?
- We'd better get back.

328
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,930
The tape ran out five minutes ago.

329
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,360
I told you not to disturb us.

330
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,070
<i>It's important.
There's been intruders in the warehouse.</i>

331
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,450
Put Security on full alert.

332
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,750
Let's see where Mr St John Smythe is.

333
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,460
He was the man at the Eiffel Tower.

334
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,170
- We must find him.
- I'll get dressed.

335
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,810
May Day, where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

336
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,890
To take care of me personally.

337
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,540
I see you're a woman of very few words.

338
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,540
What's there to say?

339
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,480
- Is everything here?
- Ja, ja.

340
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,730
Except this.

341
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,990
It is in the wrong place.

342
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:21,040
Bring St John Smythe to my study
first thing in the morning.

343
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,540
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

344
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,670
I understand you wish to see me.

345
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:40,550
- You slept well?
- A little restless, but I got off eventually.

346
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,220
I have the Progeny Index on the computer:

347
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,810
a compilation of
thoroughbred bloodlines.

348
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,530
Might be helpful to you in selecting
your purchase this afternoon.

349
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,980
As I see it, you need a stallion. For breeding.

350
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,230
A stallion sounds right to me.

351
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,820
I find a computer indispensable.

352
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,340
I have a stallion.
Descended from that horse there.

353
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,760
Misty.

354
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,140
We have several horses
that might interest you.

355
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,450
Would you be interested
primarily in stamina?

356
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,650
- Or speed?
- Well, a little of both would be ideal.

357
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,490
I think I have just the horse for you.

358
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,920
It's time for my morning ride.

359
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,680
- Why don't you try him out?
- That sounds a very good idea.

360
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,140
- I shall get into some riding clothes.
- Good.

361
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,970
Half an hour, then. Scarpine will collect you.

362
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:08,180
Thank you.

363
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,280
Tibbett, get into town, call M
and ask him to put a trace on this cheque.

364
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,530
Be quick. If those guards we laid out
identify us we'll have to move fast.

365
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,620
What shall I say if they ask where I'm going?

366
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,410
Just tell them
you have to get the car washed.

367
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,200
Just going to town to get the car washed.

368
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:26,100
- Your mount, Mr St John Smythe.
- A beautiful beast.

369
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,840
A little spirited. What's his name?

370
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:32,640
Inferno.

371
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,470
<i>Merci.</i>

372
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,610
- Friends of yours?
- Exercise boys.

373
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:06,490
Jumping together is more realistic training.

374
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,820
Frankly, I prefer cross-country
to steeplechase.

375
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:15,790
As one sportsman to another,
I'll make you a proposition.

376
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,740
You can have that lthacus colt gratis
if you stay this course.

377
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,210
- And if I'm thrown?
- Then you lose.

378
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,220
You leave me little choice.

379
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,090
Splendid. Scarpine will start us.

380
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,960
Steady!

381
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,500
Keep going! Keep going!

382
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,080
Sir Godfrey. Let's get...

383
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,930
You lost, 007.

384
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:46,020
- Killing Tibbett was a mistake.
- I'm about to make the same one twice.

385
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,980
My department know I'm here.
They'll retaliate.

386
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,480
If you're the best they have,

387
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,410
they'll more likely try
to cover up your incompetence.

388
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,320
Don't count on it, Zorin.

389
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,080
- You amuse me, Mr Bond.
- Well, it's not mutual.

390
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,040
Other side.

391
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,420
Open up-

392
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,060
- Good morning, Comrade Zorin.
- General Gogol.

393
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:36,980
- This meeting is ill-advised.
- A calculated risk.

394
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,810
But necessary,
as you refuse to answer your control.

395
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,440
Come to the point, General.

396
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,290
You disregard procedure.

397
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:47,860
You did not request approval
before eliminating 007.

398
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:53,000
- Reprisals might jeopardize operations.
- You jeopardize mine!

399
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,800
Letting the British penetrate
the Siberian research center.

400
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,380
That was regrettable.

401
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,590
Your racing activities
attract unnecessary attention,

402
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:09,350
but more disturbing are your
unauthorized commercial ventures.

403
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:10,930
We cannot tolerate that.

404
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,100
The issue is irrelevant.
I've made new associations.

405
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,520
I no longer consider myself a KGB agent.

406
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,650
We trained you. Financed you. Huh!

407
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:27,620
What would you be without us?
A biological experiment. A freak.

408
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,080
Enough of this! Control yourselves!

409
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:49,260
You will come back to us, Comrade.
No one ever leaves the KGB.

410
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,760
Gentlemen.

411
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:58,980
For centuries alchemists
tried to make gold from base metals.

412
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:04,400
Today we make microchips
from silicon, which is common sand.

413
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,110
But far better than gold, hm?

414
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,870
For several years we've had
a profitable partnership:

415
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:17,700
you as manufacturers, while I passed on
to you industrial information

416
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:21,590
that made you competitive, successful.

417
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,880
We are now in the unique position
to form an international cartel

418
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:36,270
to control not only production
but distribution of these microchips.

419
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,110
There is one obstacle.

420
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,660
Silicon Valley.

421
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,750
Near San Francisco.

422
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:02,050
Over 250 plants employing
thousands of scientists, technicians.

423
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,720
This is the heartland of electronic
production in the United States,

424
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:10,340
which accounts for what-
80% of the world microchip market.

425
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,010
I propose to end

426
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,350
the domination of Silicon Valley

427
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:22,940
- and leave us in control of that market.
- What is it you propose?

428
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:26,310
Project Main Strike.

429
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,730
For which, each of you will pay me
one hundred million dollars.

430
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,370
A hundred million dollars?

431
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,950
Plus half our net income?

432
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,290
Under an exclusive
marketing agreement with me.

433
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:42,710
These are outrageous terms!

434
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,290
Perhaps a demonstration
would convince you.

435
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:51,210
- I want no part of it, thank you.
- As you wish. Humph!

436
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,720
The rest of our discussion
must of course be confidential.

437
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,850
- Would you wait outside?
- If you'd like me to, yes. Excuse me.

438
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,230
May Day will provide you with a drink.

439
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,070
This way.

440
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,810
Aaagghhh!

441
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,020
So, does anybody else want to drop out?

442
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,070
Wow!

443
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,070
What a view!

444
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,870
To a kill.

445
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,820
Five dollars.

446
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,030
Thank you.

447
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,580
- Looking for something special?
- Yes. Soft-shell crabs.

448
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,710
Might have some in the back.

449
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,880
I'll be a few minutes.

450
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:59,600
Chuck Lee, CIA.
It's a pleasure working with 007.

451
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:03,600
- Thanks. Now what about Zorin?
- He's in town. I can have him tailed.

452
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,060
No, not yet.

453
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,940
Conley is a geologist. Runs Zorin's
oil reclamation project in the East Bay.

454
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,410
Last job: chief engineer
in a South African gold mine.

455
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,370
Left in a hurry
after a cave-in killed 20 miners.

456
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,790
Zorin's kind of man!
What about the girl? And the cheque?

457
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,740
You know how many S Suttons
there are in the US?

458
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,410
We watch Zorin's account.
The cheque hasn't been cashed.

459
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,450
- Mortner?
- Got a real winner here.

460
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:34,550
His real name is Hans Glaub, a German
pioneer in the development of steroids.

461
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,010
That ties in with the horse injections.

462
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:43,090
In the war he used steroids on pregnant
women in the concentration camps

463
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,800
in an attempt to enhance intelligence.

464
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:49,110
- With any success?
- Virtually every mother aborted.

465
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:52,190
A handful of children
were produced with phenomenal lQs.

466
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,400
But there was a side-effect:
they were psychotics.

467
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,730
Why wasn't this Mortner or Glaub
tried by the War Crimes Commission?

468
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,870
The Russians grabbed him.
Set him up in a laboratory.

469
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:06,950
He spent years developing steroids for
their athletes, then vanished 15 years ago.

470
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,170
About the same time
Zorin came over to the West.

471
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,920
Could Zorin be one of the steroid kids?

472
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,600
He's definitely the right age,
and he's certainly psychotic.

473
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,100
What about his oil operations?

474
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,430
Mr O'Rourke!

475
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:24,810
Aye!

476
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,810
- Can you spare a minute?
- Sure thing.

477
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:33,570
The oil operation looks clean, except
for a problem with the crab fishermen.

478
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:37,480
Good morning.
Here's that reporter I told you about.

479
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,280
Mr O'Rourke.
I understand you have a problem.

480
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:44,740
That Zorin oil pumping station ruined
one of the best crab patches in the Bay.

481
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,070
Scared them away?

482
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,000
They didn't go nowhere.
They just disappeared.

483
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,340
Well, I'd like to look at
that oil pumping station.

484
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,460
That'll be tough. It's very heavily guarded.

485
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,990
We'll be testing new equipment shortly.
Keep a sharp lookout.

486
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:26,040
- I don't want anyone near this dock.
- Very good, sir.

487
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:30,330
- Valves <i>5</i> to 15 are open.
- What's the report from the wells?

488
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,250
<i>Valves open and ready to receive water.</i>

489
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:37,380
<i>Good. Open valves 16 to 25.</i>

490
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,930
<i>Valve 10 at half capacity, sir.</i>

491
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,800
<i>Give me an update on valve procedure
for the Main Strike program.</i>

492
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,130
<i>We'll have a field crew
check it out in the morning.</i>

493
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,620
- Valves to wells 26 to 30 open, sir.
- Right.

494
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,460
Activate pumping procedure.
50 per cent power.

495
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,170
Increase it.

496
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:23,880
Maximum.

497
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,800
The new seals are not fully tested.

498
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,680
Main Strike's in three days. Any delays,

499
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:33,060
I hold you responsible.

500
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,140
Yes, sir.

501
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,600
Bring it up to full. Slowly.

502
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,450
- Shut down! The propeller's jammed.
- Fix it.

503
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:57,980
You there! Get a man down there!

504
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,150
Let's go, move. Come on, you guys.
Gimme a hand.

505
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:06,860
- Get the alarms turned off.
- Yes, sir.

506
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:11,490
Hurry up, goddammit!
Clear that pump.

507
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,660
We're behind schedule.

508
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,870
Give it to me.

509
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:28,890
Ha!

510
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,550
Guard!

511
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,990
Tell Conley to resume pumping.

512
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,570
This is yours, I believe.

513
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,400
Defuse it.

514
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:34,110
Aaaggghhh!

515
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:19,950
Well!

516
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,540
- Pola Ivanoval
- James Bond!

517
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:26,710
- Check the beach area.
- Let's get out of here.

518
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,660
That feels wonderful!

519
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:01,490
Feels even better from where I'm sitting.

520
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:06,370
- Would you like it harder?
- James, you haven't changed.

521
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:08,670
Well, you have.

522
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,840
You're even lovelier.

523
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:17,880
James, that night in London
when I was with the Bolshoi...

524
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,800
What a performance!

525
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,060
In my dressing room later...

526
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:27,850
Did you know I was an agent
with orders to seduce you?

527
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:33,900
Why do you think I sent you
three dozen red roses?

528
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:38,200
Now that was a performance.

529
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,090
Quite a coincidence,
us running into one another!

530
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:00,470
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- Let's not talk shop.

531
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:02,720
Let's put on something more...

532
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,270
- inspirational.
- Why not?

533
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:25,740
<i>' Ohh!</i>

534
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,710
Are you all right?

535
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,960
The bubbles tickle my...

536
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,790
Tchaikovsky!

537
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,930
Détente can be beautiful.

538
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:42,260
<i>This is no time to be discussing politics.</i>

539
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:09,410
Pola?

540
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:10,710
Yes, darling?

541
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:15,800
You know something? Tomorrow
I shall buy you six dozen red roses.

542
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:19,630
How lovely, darling. I can't wait.

543
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,360
The tape?

544
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,590
<i>The Silicon Valley operation
must not be delayed.</i>

545
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:08,340
<i>Main Strike's in three days.
Any delays, I hold you responsible.</i>

546
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:13,150
<i>It's essential the remaining pipelines
are open on time.</i>

547
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,870
Our economy needs investors like Mr Zorin.

548
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,660
California welcomes him with open arms.

549
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,370
- May I quote you on that, Mr Howe?
- Certainly.

550
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:36,420
<i>Is there anything else I can tell
the Financial Times?</i>

551
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:42,640
Yes. My readers want to know why Zorin
is pumping sea water into his pipeline

552
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,380
instead of pumping oil out.

553
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:50,220
Sea water is used to test
the integrity of the pipeline.

554
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,140
It's a lot safer than oil.
Just in case there are any leaks.

555
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,570
Well, I... I didn't know that.

556
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,570
Well, thank you, Mr Howe.
That about wraps it up.

557
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,110
Would you come this way, please?

558
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,410
If you'd like any further information
just call me, Mr...

559
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:15,160
Stock. James Stock. Thank you, Mr Howe.

560
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,590
- Mr Howe!
- Stacey, what do you want?

561
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:23,420
I have some porosity tests
I want to show you.

562
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:26,970
- I can only spare a couple of minutes.
- OK.

563
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,930
Ahem!

564
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,100
Sorry.

565
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,590
Come out real slow.

566
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:23,390
Just another Zorin stooge, Mr...
whatever your name was.

567
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:26,480
Actually, it's James Stock.
London Financial Times.

568
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:29,940
You can, uh... You can tell the police which.

569
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,910
And you can tell them about the $5
million payoff you received from Zorin.

570
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35,690
I saw the cheque.

571
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:42,540
You cut the line.

572
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:45,790
Get back.

573
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,090
Sit down.

574
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,530
- What's this loaded with?
- Rock salt.

575
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:16,660
Now you tell me.

576
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:29,540
No!

577
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:43,100
The vase! No!

578
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:46,060
Take this.

579
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:50,270
Oh, hell!

580
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,360
Sorry, Granddad.

581
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,250
Hey, wait for me!

582
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,510
Thank you.

583
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,310
My pleasure.

584
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:25,730
All the king's horses and all his men
won't do much with that.

585
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:28,480
That's all right. It was Granddad's ashes.

586
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,850
But he always loved a good fight.

587
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:33,440
I'm Stacey. Sutton.

588
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:36,150
- Yes.
- And... you're a reporter.

589
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:38,480
- What was it?
- Stock. James Stock.

590
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:41,540
- Right.
- Yes, I'm researching an article on Zorin.

591
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:44,660
I used a friend's name
to get an invitation to the chateau.

592
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,030
I can tell you a few things about Zorin.

593
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,120
I'd like to hear them.

594
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,460
I have to feed him. Are you hungry?

595
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:56,290
- What are you serving? Whiskas?
- I only have leftovers in the fridge.

596
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,050
- I'm a pathetic cook.
- I'll lend a hand.

597
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:02,760
- You can cook?
- I've been known to dabble.

598
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:12,520
<i>E t voila! Quiche de cabinet.</i>

599
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,770
Sounds interesting. What is it?

600
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,700
An omelet.

601
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,820
Now, you were telling me
about your grandfather.

602
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:26,160
He left Sutton Oil to Dad <i>-</i> who expected
me, as the only child, to take it over.

603
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,290
- So at college I studied geology.
- And then what happened?

604
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:33,960
Zorin. He took over Sutton Oil
in a rigged proxy fight.

605
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:37,380
I fought him in the courts.
It's taken all I had.

606
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:40,430
All the cash, the furniture, everything.

607
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,720
So I took this job as state geologist

608
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,520
and I've just managed
to hold on to the house and my shares.

609
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:50,730
And that's what the $5 million were for?
Your shares?

610
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:54,890
Ten times more than they're worth. Just...

611
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:00,030
Just drop the lawsuit and shut my mouth.

612
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,650
I haven't accepted yet.

613
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:06,490
So Zorin sent along his gorillas
to help you make up your mind.

614
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:10,410
They have.

615
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:18,470
I'd sell everything and live in a tent
before I give up.

616
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,030
That was delicious.

617
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,280
And the way you handled those men.

618
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:51,420
Well, those...

619
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,660
baboons could come back.

620
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:57,000
I hope not.

621
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,550
Well, then, I'll...

622
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:06,550
check the windows and doors, and...

623
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,260
- Oh! Reconnect the telephone.
- The box is outside my bedroom window.

624
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,060
I think I should be able to find that.

625
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,420
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

626
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,130
Oh, I say! Breakfast out of bed.

627
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,890
- What's wrong with them?
- We had an earth tremor.

628
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,140
They're extremely sensitive
to seismic activity.

629
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:37,310
Let's see what
the Earthquake Center has on it.

630
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:43,650
Just a minor tremor. Measured 2.5
on the Richter scale. Location...

631
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:47,610
That's odd.
The epicenter’s near Zorin's oil field.

632
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:54,280
I told Howe yesterday that Zorin
was pumping sea water into his wells.

633
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,080
- Is there a connection?
- Sea water?

634
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,880
Those wells are in the Hayward fault.

635
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,250
- Are you sure?
- I checked it myself.

636
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,080
That's incredibly dangerous.

637
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,380
Howe has to stop Zorin now.

638
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,900
- What happened?
- I got fired.

639
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:29,360
- He fire... He fired me.
- All right. Calm down.

640
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,540
This evening we'll meet
a friend of mine from Washington.

641
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:36,860
Maybe, just maybe,
he'll come up with a few answers.

642
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:48,050
I wish we could be more specific about
Zorin's intentions before I go to the top.

643
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,710
Flooding a fault
could cause a major earthquake.

644
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:54,090
But what would Zorin have to gain?

645
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:59,890
On the tape Zorin mentioned Silicon Valley.
Could that be affected?

646
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:03,310
No, not severely.
Silicon Valley's too far away.

647
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:07,770
But if we knew how many wells were
involved... we might get a clearer picture.

648
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:11,700
That information's available at City Hall.

649
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:15,070
- I still have my security <i>pass.</i>
- Then let's go to City Hall.

650
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:18,750
- Let me go and get it.
- I'll tell Washington we need more help.

651
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:21,830
Don't waste any time. There's only 24 hours.

652
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,920
- Good evening, Jeff.
- Evening, ma'am.

653
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:23,350
- Won't be long.
- OK.

654
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:24,030
- Main Strike.
- Hey, I know that place.

655
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:29,540
That's an abandoned silver mine
by the San Andreas fault.

656
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:36,260
Alive and well, I see.
And still bungling in the dark.

657
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,340
Well, then,
why don't you enlighten me, Zorin?

658
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,720
You're out of your depth.

659
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:48,770
And you, Sutton. You should have
accepted my more than generous offer.

660
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:52,480
- You can take your offer and shove it.
- Don't bother, Stacey.

661
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,100
He's a psychopath.

662
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:57,570
You two have joined forces?

663
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:03,240
- That simplifies things.
- He's probably armed.

664
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,790
Stacey, I...

665
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,210
Mr Zorin.

666
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,380
Call the police, Mr Howe.

667
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:24,630
- What's going on?
- Tell them... there's been a break-in.

668
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,850
Ask them to get here as soon as possible.

669
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,270
You're being used, Mr Howe.

670
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,140
Do it.

671
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,200
<i>- Police
- Hello.</i>

672
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,610
We've had a break-in here.

673
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:44,620
- City Hall, office 306. Come at once.
- <i>Right</i> away.

674
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:49,290
- What have they done?
- You discharged her.

675
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:53,620
So she and her accomplice
came here to kill you.

676
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:58,000
Then they set fire to the office
to conceal the crime,

677
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,250
but they were trapped in the elevator.

678
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,350
And perished in the flames.

679
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:11,180
But that means I would have to be...

680
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,760
Dead.

681
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:20,230
That's rather neat. Don't you think?

682
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,450
Brilliant.
I'm almost speechless with admiration.

683
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:29,790
Intuitive improvisation
is the secret of genius.

684
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,500
Herr Doktor Mortner
will be proud of his creation.

685
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:50,940
Please.

686
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:57,180
Get back.

687
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,810
- Out.
- Let's go.

688
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,310
Get back!

689
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:22,560
Hold tight.

690
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:35,240
Come on, Stacey.

691
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,960
Give me your hand. Stretch!

692
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:40,590
Stretch I

693
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:47,800
Don't go away

694
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,020
James, don't leave me!

695
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,650
James!

696
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,770
Help me!

697
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,620
James!

698
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:15,450
Help me! Help me!

699
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:23,170
James!

700
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,510
I'll be right with you.

701
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,850
Help! Help!

702
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:42,310
- It is the City Hall.
- I'll call the fire department.

703
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:50,940
Try and come this side of the girder.

704
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:53,320
- Catch this.
- I can't reach it!

705
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,490
Come on. Catch!

706
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:58,700
Now... push!

707
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:22,190
Go on.

708
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:27,560
Good girl. You're nearly there.

709
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,060
Go on, stretch!

710
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:51,510
Get this TV crew outta here, will ya?

711
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,010
Come on. Get outta my way.

712
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:08,610
All we know is that there are
people trapped inside of City Hall.

713
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,820
Come on. Back off, will ya?

714
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:58,940
Let us through, goddammit.

715
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:20,420
Give her some air.
Comin' through. Out of the way, please.

716
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,980
Stacey. Stacey, you're safe.

717
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,480
Let me through.
Let me through, goddammit.

718
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:31,900
I wanna talk to you.

719
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:35,360
Captain. If you can get to
Howe's office you'll find him dead.

720
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,690
We found him - and this gun. This yours?

721
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:40,150
- Yes, thanks.
- Turn around.

722
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,960
If you check with Chuck Lee of the CIA,
he'll inform you who I am.

723
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:46,780
- We found his body in Chinatown.
- What?

724
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,920
- You're under arrest.
- Wait.

725
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:52,630
<i>This is James Stock
of the London Financial Times.</i>

726
01:33:52,710 --> 01:33:55,300
Actually I'm with the British Secret Service.

727
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,590
The name is Bond. James Bond.

728
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,010
- Is he?
- Are you?

729
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:01,180
Yes.

730
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,380
And I'm Dick Tracy
and you're still under arrest.

731
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:09,350
Get in here.

732
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:22,580
Hey, where's that guy goin'?
That ladder's unlocked.

733
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,460
Is that true what you said
about the British secret service?

734
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:29,750
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

735
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:36,420
My real name is Bond. James Bond.
You must take my word for it.

736
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,030
Put your hand on this.

737
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:03,580
The wheel! Take over. Put your foot on here.

738
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:09,450
James, where are you going?

739
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:15,580
<i>To all units. Intercept
murder suspect in stolen fire truck.</i>

740
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:18,670
He may be armed and he's sure dangerous.

741
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,680
- Pull away you idiots.
- I can't. The fenders are locked!

742
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:45,440
- I told you, they're locked!
- Oh, my God, watch out!

743
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,380
Ohhh!

744
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,010
- Jeez!
- Turn!

745
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:12,800
Not this way. That way!

746
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:14,020
Shit!

747
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,320
Ohhhh!

748
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:28,990
- Swing me back!
- Oh, jeez!

749
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:50,310
Drive on!

750
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,320
- I think I can get him.
- Go for it!

751
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,670
That should keep them on the wrong track.

752
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:32,600
Hello.

753
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:36,260
Raise the bridge? Right now?

754
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:39,060
Yes, sir!

755
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:42,820
I got him. Oh, jeez, I got him!

756
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,110
Keep going, keep going!

757
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:17,970
Oh, my God!

758
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:29,150
Hey, watch out! Get out of the way!

759
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:34,280
Jesus!

760
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:39,170
Oh, mother! I... I...

761
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:45,670
Holy shit!

762
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,340
Move it!

763
01:38:57,590 --> 01:38:59,270
Harris...

764
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:01,560
Forget about that sergeant promotion.

765
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:05,940
You'll have to pay for this vehicle.
100 bucks a month out of your paycheck.

766
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:16,610
Oh, no!

767
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:25,080
Wake up. We're there.

768
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,380
There's a lot of activity
for an abandoned mine.

769
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,510
That truckload of explosives
should last them for months.

770
01:39:34,130 --> 01:39:35,680
Here comes next year's supply.

771
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:38,050
Get down.

772
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,360
- Where's the fire?
- On your rear end.

773
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:03,080
Give me <i>a</i> hand.

774
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:11,510
Hey!

775
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:13,010
Gerry...

776
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,270
- It's the rules. Hard hat area.
- Thanks.

777
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:23,440
Follow the signs.

778
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,570
Move it. You're late!

779
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,870
You two, come here.

780
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:40,950
Give us a hand unloading this.

781
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:42,580
OK, leave it there.

782
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:46,790
Get a coffee over at the hut.
Come back in 20 minutes.

783
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:51,460
It's women's lib.
They're taking over the Teamsters.

784
01:40:54,710 --> 01:40:58,140
OK, get this stuff movin'!
We're an hour late.

785
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:12,150
I should take a closer look at that mine.

786
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:14,980
Ahem!

787
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,280
What's stopping you?

788
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:24,250
That's a good idea of yours.
Pity you couldn't find one that fits.

789
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:33,330
Why walk when you can ride?

790
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,260
Keep it coming, keep it coming.

791
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:39,170
OK, let's go.

792
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:44,470
Will you keep still!

793
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:46,900
Do you know what I'm sitting on?

794
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:51,440
I'm trying not to think about it.

795
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:09,830
<i>Stand clear. Stand clear.</i>

796
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:17,170
<i>All personnel not on essential duties,
leave underground area immediately.</i>

797
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,390
<i>Standby crew, we need you up here.</i>

798
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:35,690
<i>Ready to unload.</i>

799
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:43,240
<i>OK, stand clear.</i>

800
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:49,080
<i>Let's go, standby crew.</i>

801
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:55,040
<i>Break off. Stand clear.</i>

802
01:43:05,550 --> 01:43:09,770
<i>Standby forward. Bring the gag
up here and clear these barriers away.</i>

803
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:17,850
Come on, let's go.
We haven't got all day.

804
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,980
Clear the safety barrier.

805
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:30,280
Come on, move!

806
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:34,500
Hey, on the crane!
Swing the cradle over here.

807
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:37,790
Take it off. Take it off.

808
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,870
Bring it over. Bring it over. Easy.

809
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:04,700
Good, good.

810
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:16,040
- You found anything?
- Yes. I think I have.

811
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:20,920
Good.

812
01:44:21,670 --> 01:44:23,170
Good. Hold 'em.

813
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:37,860
OK, get those wedges in there tight!

814
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:55,410
Come on,
lay the head down here. OK?

815
01:44:55,990 --> 01:45:00,840
The San Andreas Lake is right above us.
Lots of seepage. Could ﬂood any minute.

816
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:05,220
Finish shoring up the roof.
I'll send the lug back.

817
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:07,100
OK.

818
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:09,720
Bring up some timber, on the double!

819
01:45:17,970 --> 01:45:19,730
He'll kill millions.

820
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:24,450
These green lights - they're Zorin's oil wells.

821
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:28,740
The ones he's been using to pump
sea water into the Hayward fault.

822
01:45:29,150 --> 01:45:31,450
What are these tunnels for
under these lakes?

823
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:35,960
These lead straight into this section
of the San Andreas fault.

824
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:41,760
Zorin just has to blast through the
bottom of these lakes to flood the fault.

825
01:45:42,290 --> 01:45:46,470
- And create a... double earthquake?
- Yes. Except...

826
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:50,640
Except right beneath us
is the key geological lock

827
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:53,560
that keeps the faults from moving at once.

828
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,180
Hey, let's go!

829
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:15,240
All those explosives.
Would they be enough to break the lock?

830
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:17,530
Of course!

831
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:22,130
If they go off, both faults move at once.

832
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:26,210
Silicon Valley and everything in it
submerged for ever.

833
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:30,800
If it happened at the peak of
the spring tide for maximum effect...

834
01:46:36,220 --> 01:46:39,440
That's today at 9.41. In less than an hour!

835
01:46:39,970 --> 01:46:43,100
- We have to go and warn people.
- Wait!

836
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,280
Stand back.

837
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:55,160
Jump!

838
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:06,460
Get him.

839
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:19,510
- Get 'em back to work.
- You men, get back to work.

840
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:24,230
It's Bond.

841
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:27,070
Close up the entrance. Nobody gets out.

842
01:47:29,150 --> 01:47:30,360
Hold it!

843
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:32,450
In.

844
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:43,160
Aagghh!

845
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:44,500
Come on.

846
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:50,050
- Did you pass anyone back there?
- No. I saw no one.

847
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,180
- Now which way?
- The map.

848
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:05,640
There's a draught from up there.

849
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,320
- It must be a ventilation shaft.
- Wait!

850
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,290
That must lead to the fault.
The water from the lakes!

851
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:23,370
Yes. And it'll be flooding any moment.

852
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:27,960
Come on.

853
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,010
You two, that way.

854
01:49:03,490 --> 01:49:05,410
Give me your hand.

855
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:29,530
It's time to flood the fault.

856
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:36,950
But... May Day. And my men.

857
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:39,360
Yeah. A convenient coincidence.

858
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:42,500
Mr Zorin, those men are loyal to you.

859
01:49:50,910 --> 01:49:51,960
Hurry!

860
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:56,170
- Get help. Quick!
- Get a doctor.

861
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:09,520
Aauugghh!

862
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:36,170
Come on, run for your life!

863
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:50,560
Give me some spare clips.

864
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:32,470
Keep climbing!

865
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:49,410
Keep going!

866
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:05,130
James!

867
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,300
Good. Right on schedule.

868
01:52:54,550 --> 01:52:55,850
Let's go.

869
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:34,390
And I thought that creep loved me!

870
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:37,520
You're not the only one he double-crossed.

871
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:56,910
All outboard valves fully locked, sir.

872
01:54:18,970 --> 01:54:20,600
The water level's dropping.

873
01:54:28,270 --> 01:54:29,740
Pump pressure good.

874
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:43,870
Jenny!

875
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:47,330
Come on. There's nothing
you can do for them now.

876
01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:58,850
Up and away!

877
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:39,220
Silicon Valley. Perfect!

878
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:42,310
Hold position here.

879
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:48,240
Only minutes more, Carl.
Nothing can stop it now.

880
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:53,110
The greatest cataclysm in history.

881
01:55:53,690 --> 01:55:57,040
And all attributed to natural causes.

882
01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:00,820
Exactly.

883
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:05,040
We must hurry.

884
01:56:07,410 --> 01:56:09,710
I have to get down
and defuse that detonator.

885
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:12,340
You can't. The time has been booby trapped.

886
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,050
If you tamper with it we're going to blow up.

887
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:18,430
Then we have to bring
the whole thing up. But how?

888
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:21,180
Get on the rig. I'll lower you down.

889
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:22,480
Get on!

890
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:50,380
Keep going!

891
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:52,080
Come on. Come on.

892
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,140
OK, hold it there.

893
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:05,600
Take it up!

894
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,940
- Get on!
- It's too heavy. Go!

895
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:10,280
Get on, dammit!

896
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:15,780
OK, go!

897
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:41,300
Keep going!

898
01:57:58,150 --> 01:57:59,650
That's it.

899
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,410
Swing it over to the truck.

900
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:09,450
Easy. Gently!

901
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,670
Right, lower it.

902
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,380
Take her up.

903
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:25,720
We've only seconds before this blows.
If it does, that powder keg goes with it.

904
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,190
The handbrake slipped.

905
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:47,210
Push! Push!

906
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:53,380
- Jump!
- I have to hold the brake off.

907
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:54,630
Jump!

908
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:57,330
Get Zorin for me!

909
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,500
May Day, jump!

910
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:03,890
Only seconds to go.

911
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:06,300
May Day, jump!

912
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,810
May Day!

913
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:42,760
James.

914
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:45,390
James!

915
01:59:46,130 --> 01:59:47,480
James!

916
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:01,820
Stacey, behind you! Get down!

917
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:05,070
James!

918
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:14,380
Come on, get in. Get up here!

919
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:20,130
The ship's nose is heavy.
He must be on the mooring rope.

920
02:01:08,630 --> 02:01:09,800
Ohhh!

921
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:35,040
This'll hurt him more than me.

922
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:19,410
More! More power.

923
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:29,670
More. Do it!

924
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:47,440
Full throttle!

925
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,120
Ohhh!

926
02:02:57,780 --> 02:02:59,380
Right rudder. Do it!

927
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:12,760
Stop it!

928
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:15,010
Get her off. Get her off!

929
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:18,760
- Stop it! Are you crazy?
- Get her off. Get away!

930
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:37,500
Go get him.

931
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:41,080
Go!

932
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:54,060
Stacey, jump!

933
02:03:59,180 --> 02:04:01,350
Get a foothold!

934
02:05:05,410 --> 02:05:08,380
Max! Max!

935
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:16,420
Aaaggghh!

936
02:05:20,590 --> 02:05:22,760
James! James!

937
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:25,850
Stacey, give me your hand.

938
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:29,780
Get under the pipe.

939
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:39,610
OK, stay there.

940
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:54,040
James, look out!

941
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:08,430
Stacey, hold tight!

942
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:23,910
- Stacey, are you there?
- You betcha!

943
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:41,170
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Yes.

944
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:45,840
There's never a cab when you want one.

945
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:51,180
The Order of Lenin, for Comrade Bond.

946
02:06:51,310 --> 02:06:54,280
The first time ever awarded
to a non-Soviet citizen.

947
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:59,280
I'd have expected the KGB to celebrate
if Silicon Valley had been destroyed.

948
02:07:00,530 --> 02:07:02,870
On the contrary, Admiral.

949
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:07,870
Where would Russian
research be without it?

950
02:07:11,830 --> 02:07:14,550
Is Commander Bond here?
I'd like to thank him personally.

951
02:07:15,370 --> 02:07:19,220
<i>Sadly he's missing.
We are continuing our search,</i>

952
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:21,550
<i>but must presume the worst.</i>

953
02:08:02,670 --> 02:08:06,170
A bit of soap here...
and a little soap there!

954
02:08:06,260 --> 02:08:09,390
- Oh, drat! I've dropped the soap.
- I'll get it. Whoo!

955
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:12,440
That is not the soap.

956
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:23,860
<i>- Hello?
- Grandfather calling Q.</i>

957
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:26,870
<i>- What's the position?
- 007 alive.</i>

958
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:31,950
- Where <i>is</i> he? What's he doing?
- Just cleaning up a few details.

959
02:08:32,870 --> 02:08:34,960
<i>Oh, James...</i>

960
02:08:36,950 --> 02:08:39,580
Mmm!

961
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:01,860
<i>Meeting you</i>

962
02:09:02,060 --> 02:09:05,440
<i>With a view to a kill</i>

963
02:09:07,490 --> 02:09:11,580
<i>Face to face in secret places</i>

964
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:13,750
<i>Feel the chill</i>

965
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:25,090
<i>Nightfall covers me</i>

966
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:29,300
<i>But you know the plans I'm making</i>

967
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:33,010
<i>Still oversee</i>

968
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:38,480
<i>Could it be the whole earth opening wide?</i>

969
02:09:40,850 --> 02:09:42,570
<i>A sacred why</i>

970
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:46,610
<i>A mystery gaping inside</i>

971
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:50,740
<i>The weekends why</i>

972
02:09:51,200 --> 02:09:55,370
<i>But can we dance into the fire?</i>

973
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:00,080
<i>That fatal kiss is all we need</i>

974
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:03,010
<i>Dance into the fire</i>

975
02:10:03,790 --> 02:10:07,720
<i>To fatal sounds of broken dreams</i>

976
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:10,720
<i>Dance into the fire</i>

977
02:10:11,550 --> 02:10:15,430
<i>That fatal kiss is all we need</i>

978
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:18,520
<i>Dance into the fire</i>

979
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:21,280
<i>When all we see</i>

980
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:25,560
<i>ls the view to a kill</i>

981
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:39,370
<i>Dance into the fire</i>

982
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:42,340
<i>When all we see</i>

983
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:46,590
<i>ls the view to a kill</i>
