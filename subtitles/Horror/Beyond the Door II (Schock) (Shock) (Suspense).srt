1
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,890
You must declare all items.

2
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,190
Undeclared items will be confiscated.

3
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,510
Cho, declare the ginseng to customs.

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,770
Why, Pop? They make us pay 50 bucks in 
duty.

5
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,860
- I know. - What if I just hide it in my 
pants?

6
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,100
- They'll never know. - Brilliant, Fei-
Hong.

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,270
Better yet, why don't we have the master 
hold onto it?

8
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,490
They'll never search him, because he's 
too respectable.

9
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,370
- What do you think? - Ha ha ha! Very 
good idea.

10
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,690
- You're hopeless... both of you. - Bad 
idea.

11
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,160
I'll not hear any more of your nonsense.

12
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,830
I just don't understand why we have to 
pay duties-

13
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,410
on everything we buy?

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,570
I don't care what you say. Just listen 
to me.

15
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,540
Avoid trouble. Pay the duties, that's it.

16
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,580
I know best.


17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,710
Back, back.

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,680
Back. Make way. Let the ambassador 
through.

19
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,250
What's going on?

20
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,850
Now watch it. It's the ambassador, and 
he deserves respect.

21
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,350
He's treated like royalty.

22
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,060
He doesn't have to pay any duties. How 
about that one?

23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,560
Wow. He's a lucky one.

24
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,030
No pushing. Don't push.

25
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,480
Everybody back.

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,650
Let these people through!

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,860
Ay!

28
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,230
Oh, no. Hey, are you all right?

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,120
Let's go. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,990
What happened?

31
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,820
- Shut up. Someone push him. - Huh?

32
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,870
Please, sir, I apologise.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,820
Listen, Fei-Hong.

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,670
- Why did you give him our ginseng? - So 
we don't have to pay tax.

35
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,460
Once we get on the train, I'll look for 
the box.

36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,760
- Ah, what a terrific idea. - What's 
that?

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,880
You could throw me down again and I'll 
hide some more.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,080
Here I go. Here I go.

39
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,260
Aah!

40
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,970
Ooh.

41
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,930
He must've tripped. Look at you. You're 
so clumsy.

42
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,090
Come on, get up.

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,180
File in!

44
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,970
Wow, what a crowd. Why don't you go get 
a seat-

45
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,310
and I'll pay the taxes?

46
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,800
All right, son. I'll see you on board.

47
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,640
If you have nothing to declare,

48
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,360
begin boarding right now.

49
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,110
Here, Fei-Hong, take this.

50
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,120
Got it.

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,620
Come on.

52
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,530
Fei-Hong, great.

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,870
Easy, easy.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,040
Be careful. You'll crush everything.

55
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,340
That's good.

56
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,840
Hold it.

57
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,880
Hey, where are you going? Stop!

58
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,760
Come back! Fei-Hong!

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,800
Fei-Hong, let him go!

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,310
Fei-Hong, forget about him!

61
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,550
Come back here. Come back.

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,890
Fei-Hong,

63
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,690
now, let me remind you.

64
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,100
A hero lives but a few seconds.

65
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,520
A master holds onto his life.

66
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,820
But he stole your wallet.

67
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,780
And I took it back.

68
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,890
That's not the issue.

69
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,640
The point is, the stronger man knows...

70
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,240
It's more important to forgive than it 
is to fight.

71
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,240
That's right.

72
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,490
What was I thinking?

73
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,090
Uhh.

74
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,550
Your turn.

75
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,930
How about this?

76
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,350
Hey, you know better than that.

77
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,550
But there's no other move.

78
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,930
Try it again.

79
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,840
Try it again.

80
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,090
Hey, look at the white crane.

81
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,480
Wow. Have you ever seen one like that?

82
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,190
It's still your play.

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,530
Come on.

84
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,060
Can we start over?

85
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,270
You still have a chance.

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,700
Where? I don't see it.

87
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,770
It's not fair. You always win.

88
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,410
Ready?

89
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,770
Oh, God!

90
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,240
Damn it!

91
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,360
Uhh...

92
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,280
Are you OK?

93
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,210

Oh...

94
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,340
I bet that hurt.

95
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,050
I'm sorry, sir.

96
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,870
- Is this yours? - I'm afraid so.

97
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,590
Be more careful.

98
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,010
Shh.

99
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,550
Yes, sir.

100
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,510
Ready?

101
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,880
Ready.

102
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,000
Fei-Hong, what's this?

103
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,090
We call it cheating.

104
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,770
You've only got 10 minutes, so hurry up.

105
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,420
Come on, we ain't got all day!

106
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,500
Oh, the ginseng... time to find it.

107
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,840
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,470
Father, forget about this.

109
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,170
Let me go find something you're really 
going to like.

110
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,830
Ha ha. I don't think I'm ready to eat,

111
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,930
but I thank you.

112
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,640
Come on, how about a nice roasted 
chicken?

113
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,640
We can find him one.

114
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,850
How about it, huh?

115
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,590
Look, I can see you two want to look 
around a bit.

116
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,060
It's OK. I'll be fine here.

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,130
- Go on. - Come on.

118
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,510
Hey-

119
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,980
you two stay out of trouble, you hear me?

120
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,480
You make sure you come right back.

121
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Pardon me.

122
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,560
Excuse me.

123
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,110
Pardon me.

124
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,020
Sorry, sorry.

125
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,910
God, do you believe the smell of this 
place?

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,400
I think I'm going to be sick.

127
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,830
God.

128
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,790
Hey, this way.

129
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,120
Wow.

130
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,420
The vegetation's much nicer.

131
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,010
Yes, I see.

132
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,370
It's making me hungry.

133
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,300
Maybe we could grab a roll.

134
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,590

Hey!

135
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,140
What are you doing here?

136
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,340
- Nothing. - Nothing.

137
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,520
You think you have reservations?

138
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,940
Yeah, yeah, we do.

139
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,940
Go on back.

140
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,940
Check inside.

141
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,190
I've had enough. Go on.

142
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,110
One more time, and you're off the train.

143
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,310
So what do we do now?

144
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,320
I got an idea.

145
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,490
Now what?

146
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,790
Just watch me.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,110
Go!

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,130
Go away! Go away!

149
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,880
Look out!

150
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,870
They've gone wild!

151
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,760
Here. Hold this.

152
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,350
- Stop him!

153
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,310
Fire! Fire!

154
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,220
Aah!

155
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,480
Sorry, sir. Huh?

156
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,520
Wait.

157
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,570
Hey!

158
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
He...

159
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,620
I'm sure he came this way.

160
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,380
Hey, stop!

161
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,590
Hey, you!

162
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,640
Where you going? - Where you 
going?

163
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,220
Hey, you.

164
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,460
Wait. Why you hit...

165
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,850
- I kill you! - Oh!

166
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,310
There. Traitor.

167
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,810
A what?

168
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,690
Hot tea, sir?

169
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,490
Hot tea for sale.

170
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,530
Thank you.

171
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,450
You leave me alone!

172
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,710
Yaah!

173
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,440
Next time, I cut your throat...

174
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,370
Traitor.

175
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,370
You.

176

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,120
Hey, listen!

177
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,920
I'm not a traitor, you hear me? You...

178
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,120
Then what are we fighting about?

179
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,160
Don't play games. You hit me.

180
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,170
Yaah!

181
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,460
Where'd he go?

182
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,620
Hey!

183
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,920
Hmm.

184
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,180
Back again? Why don't you give up?

185
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,980
Oh, no, old man. Apologise.

186
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,400
What did you say?

187
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,350
How dare you call me a traitor?

188
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,530

OK. Sorry.

189
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,270
Fine, but I still owe you one.

190
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,740
Here.

191
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,150
Hey, show respect.

192
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
Stand still.

193
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,560
Respect to you?

194
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,570
You must be kidding me.

195
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,870
Let's make this fair.

196
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,000
Huhh.

197
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,580
Ready?

198
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,560
Ah, drunken boxing.

199
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,520
That's right. I'm the master.

200
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,060
You think so?

201
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,150
Again.

202
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,940
Come on.

203
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,020
- Let's go. - You come.

204
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,820
You know-

205
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,100
a kid like you isn't worth my time.

206
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,400
I show you!


207
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,310
Tiger Slash At Bear!

208
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,610
Quail!

209
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,940
Huh?

210
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,130
What do you call that one?

211
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,750
Ha. It's called Turtle Holding Wild Bear.

212
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,120
Catch the Bouquet!

213
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,210
Eagle Catch the Rabbit!

214
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,430
Down the Hatch!

215
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,760
- Hmm. - Drunk Plays the Flute?

219
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,900
Uhh.

220
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,070
And this one?

221
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,820
Nursing a Hangover.

222
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,860
OK-

223
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,150
stand up.

224
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,950
Your kung fu is pretty good.

225
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,330
Young man, you're not too bad yourself,

226
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,530
but that drunken boxing wasn't...

227
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,250
Impressed?

228
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,210
Basically, it's slow, and you have no 
power.

229
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,950
It's pathetic.

230
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,000
What?

231
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,840
I can defeat any kung fu. I show you 
power.

232
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,050
That's nice, but you're out of time.

233
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,550
Time? I'm young and strong.

234
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,550
I've got lots of time.

235
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,090
But your train's leaving over there.

236
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,750
Nice try, old man, but now you're going 
to get it.

237
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,470
Ay. All right, kid.

238
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,760
Come back here!

239
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,880
Oh, no, the train!

240
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,140
Wait for me!

241
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,940
Come on, give me your hand.

242
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,830
Hey, thanks a lot.

243
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,870
Get what you were after?

244
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,460
Good fortune to you!

245
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,960
Ah, the ginseng.

246
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,630
Ah.

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,170
Ginseng?


248
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,090
All right, everyone here get up.

249
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,590
Gather your luggage for inspection.

250
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,140
Everyone, now. Come on.

251
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,340
You.

252
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,940
Wake up.

253
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,270
Good morning.

254
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,390
What are you doing?

255
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,890
Something has been stolen,

256
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,230
and we're going to find it.

257
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,970
Guard,-

258
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,990
-search them.

259
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,610
All right, what is all that?

260
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,740
You, take it out.

261
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,690
Hurry up.

262
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,410
Cho, open this. Fei-Hong.

263
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,440
Let me see.

264
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,910
Bear claw.

265
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,690
What else? Come on.

266
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,830
Green toad.

267
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,250
Next.

268
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,280
Deer horn, ginseng...

269
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,880
What's that? The one you dropped.

270
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,990
Open that.

271
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,370
This one?

272
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,740
What's that?

273
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,120
Dried yak.

274
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,590
OK, next. - Shit.

275
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,790
Now the other box. Come on.

276
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,800
Let me see the other box.

277
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,470
Acorn.

278
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,540
Not that... that.

279
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,960
Let me see that one.

280
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,100
Not that one. The one over there.

281
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,210
Which one?

282
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,640
On the seat... between you.

283
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,010
This? No, no, no. That one.

284
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,560
He means the ginseng.

285
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,850
He wasn't hiding it.

286
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,560
Well, then open it up.

287
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,440
What are you waiting for?

288
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,440
Open that box!

289
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,440
Right now!

290
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,640
Excuse me, sir-

291
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,310
these gentlemen are clearly physicians 
from Hunan.

292
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,280
Why don't you give them a break, huh?

293
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,350
I don't give breaks. I give orders.

294
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,990
Show me your papers.

295
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,530
Come on, let's see them.

296
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,540
Here.

297
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,290
Sir, my apologies.

298
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,040
Shh.

299
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,130
Sir.

300
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,490
He's with Counterintelligence.

301
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,840
He's with the central government.

302
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,670
Better not challenge his authority.

303
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,870
All right, next car.

304
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,590
- Search up there. - Next car.

305
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,180
I'm amazed they would think

306
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,510
we would steal anything.

307
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,220
It is such an insult.

308
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,220
Yeah.

309
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,930
Put that away.

310
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,060
Do you all realise what this means?

311
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,110
They certainly won't buy the rest of the 
shipment-

312
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,650
without it.

313
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,070
You know, I'm truly astounded

314
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,910
at the incompetence of all of you.

315
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,950
You severely damaged my reputation

316
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,980
with the British Museum of Art.

317
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,190
They've asked me to deliver

318
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,290
the jade seal of the emperor,

319
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,200
and I have every intention

320
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,250
of fulfilling that request.

321
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,910
I don't care how you do it.

322
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,420
I want it back.

323
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,590
Yes, sir.

324
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,340
We think we know who the thief is, sir.

325
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,470
Get him.

326
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,500
Yes, sir.

327
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,580
John-

328
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
we're having a bit of trouble

329
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,920
with the workers at the steel factory.

330
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,470
I trust you'll deal with it.

331
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,510
Of course, sir.

332
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,430
I know just what to do in this situation.

333
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,310
I promise you'll have no more trouble.

334
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,400
Let's make sure.

335
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,340
Yes, sir.

336
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,860
Uhh!

337
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,700
Ancestors be blessed.

338
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,860
Ha!

339
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,240
It's grand slam.

340
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,410
Aw...

341
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,660
Ha ha ha!

342
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,960
Let's go, let's go. Come on, come on, 
pay up, pay up.

343
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,870
Quickly. We haven't got all day.

344
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,460
Go and see who is at the door.

345
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,880
Come on.

346
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,930
Money. Ha ha ha! That's the way.

347
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,930
More. Now your turn.

348
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,340
Come on.

349
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,390
She wins every turn.

350
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,970
Madam?

351
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,090
The master is back.

352
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,590
Yeah, yeah, the master.

353
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,390
Oh, God, it's my husband!

354
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,470
Hi.

355
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,730
Hello.

356
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,230
What took you so long?

357
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,770
I was in the kitchen.

358
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,360
Uhh. Unh.

359
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,940
Stand back.

360
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,520
Here.

361
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,900
Miss me?

362
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,330
What are you all doing?

363
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,650
Oh, it's you. I'm so glad you're home.

364
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,750
How was your trip?

365
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,410
Is everything all right?

366
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,580
All right?

367
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,120
Um... oh.

368
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,200
Hmm.

369
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,670
More mah-jongg?

370
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,710
Quiet!

371
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,830
How many times have I asked you

372
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,580
not to see patients while I'm away?

373
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,620
You know it's illegal.

374
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,510
Oh, now, I know I'm not supposed to,

375
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,850
and I tried to wait, but I had no idea

376
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,760
when you would return. Besides, if you 
were me,

377
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,500
I know you would've done the same thing.

378
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,850
Wow. I bet you won a lot.

379
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,350
Not now.

380
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,770
Perhaps I should examine them.

381
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,430
Uh, oh, it's a female problem.

382
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,940
I can handle it.

383
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,140
Fei-Hong, would you prepare my altar for 
me?

384
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,490
All right.

385
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,810
You should wash your hands.

386
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,350
Stop it.

387
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,560
We'll need the altar ladder over here, 
please.

388
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
Did you remember to water the plants?

389
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,160
- Oh, yes. - Excellent.

390
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,540
Thank you.

391
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,500
Hey, Mom, whose money?

392
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,140
Wow.

393
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,760
- Son. - Huh?

394
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,790
What was that?

395
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,710
I didn't hear anything.

396
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,890
The altar.

397
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,090
Hmm.

398
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,810
Oh, thanks for coming.

399
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,800
My share. Gimme.

400
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,150
Go. Go.

401
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,900
Hey-

402
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
show a little respect.

403
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,200
Now, remember your treatment

404
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,740
next Friday, ladies.

405
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,320
Bring money. Ha ha ha.

406
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,790
Hello, Mrs. Wong.

407
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,580
How are you? Has Master Wong returned?

408
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,950
Yes. He's inside.

409
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,950
Any news about my ginseng?

410
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,920
Did he get it?

411
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,170
Let's ask him. Come in.

412
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,170
Oh, thank you.

413
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,670
Mr. Chan has come for his ginseng.

414
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,170
Ah, Mr. Chan, I'm...

415
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,910
Why are you here so soon?

416
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,010
Fei-Hong.

417
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,470
- The ginseng's in the back. - I know.

418
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,880
- Let me get it. - Go on.

419
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,090
It's beautiful. I brought you a whole 
root.

420
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
Wait till you see it.

421
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,600
It's just in back. Some tea?

422
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,840
Ah, you are so kind.

423
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,670
Yes. Please have a seat. I'll be right 
back.

424
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,880
Thank you.

425
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,140
I'm getting out of here.


426
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,640
Where are you going? You got to help me 
out.

427
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,730
When the master finds out, he'll kill me.

428
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,730
He will not.

429
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,930
Fei-Hong.

430
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,050
What are you doing?

431
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,230
Stepma, come here.

432
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,860
I don't know what to do.

433
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,140
We're in such trouble.

434
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,490
I lost the ginseng on the train.

435
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,200
What? What did you do now?

436
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,230
What'd she say?

437
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,610
OK, OK, OK. Shh.

438
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,980
Please. You got to help us out.

439
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,330
Fei-Hong!

440
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,330
Yes, Dad!

441
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,910
You just go out and serve him tea.

442
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,370
I'll think of something.

443
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,200
I'll leave it up to you two. Coming!

444
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,280
Oh, madam, what should we do about this?

445
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,330
You see that door behind me?

446
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,330
You mean...

447
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,880
- In the cabinet. - Sure.

448
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,080
- There's a black box. - Oh, yeah?

449
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,120
Look inside it.

450
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,550
Ah, another ginseng. I can't believe it!

451
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,050
Strychnine.

452
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,300
- What for? - For you.

453
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,290
Oh, no, madam, please don't tease me 
this way!

454
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,300
Who's teasing?

455
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,430
I have your tea, Mr. Chan.

456
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,980
Thank you very much, son.

457
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,980
Enjoy it.

458
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,440
Go, go.

459
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,600
Father, you must be very hot.

460
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,160
- Let me help you. - Mr. Chan.

461
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,160
Hmm?

462
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,780
Wow.

463
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,320
It's real.

464
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,280
Now, Mr. Chan, I know you have never seen

465
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,610
a specimen as beautiful as this, have 
you?

466
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,450
Oh, and let me tell you... wait till you 
see

467
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,790
what happens to you when you take it.

468
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,110
Why, women won't believe the difference

469
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,670
in your performance, and you will owe it

470
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,660
all to the master.

471
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,830
What are you doing with that rutabaga?

472
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,960
Ohh.

473
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,590
Rutabaga?

474
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,550
This is a rutabaga?

475
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:27,800
You mean it isn't ginseng?

476
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
- No. - Silly of me.

477
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,010
Of course it isn't ginseng. What I meant 
to tell you

478
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,500
was that you should stay away from 
rutabagas-

479
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,180
especially big rutabagas like this one-

480
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,550
while you're taking ginseng.

481
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,630
It causes gas and neutralises the effect

482
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,350
or something like that.

483
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,900
Excuse me.

484
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,180
Mr. Chan...

485
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,520
I'm glad she remembered to tell you 
about that.

486
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,700
You know, most people don't realise

487
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,110
that when you use ginseng

488
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,780
you should avoid the use of rutabaga,

489
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,450
because they're not a good mix.

490
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,820
Rutabaga, shmutabaga.

491
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,830
Stop that, Fei-Hong!

492
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,870
Hi. Back so soon?

493
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,610
Oh, Lord. Now what?

494
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,960
Good luck, now.

495
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,210
You think this looks like ginseng?

496
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,580
Oh, yeah, it looks just like it.

497
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,580
Where did you find it?

498
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,200
Father's bonsai tree.

499
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,670
What a great idea. Just blame it on Cho.

500
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,580
- OK. - Aah!

501
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,540
I'll try to keep your father distracted.

502
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,800
What do you think of this?

503
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,180
Boy, that looks great.

504
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,180
Great. I'm a genius.

505
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,390
Excuse me. May I have a word?

506
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,190
Just a second.

507
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,980
Of course. I can wait.

508
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,440
What is it, dear?

509
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,860
- Come. - What?

510
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,570
Come on. Just one minute.

511
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,450
Can't this wait? I'm busy right now.

512
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,480
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait

513
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,700
any longer to tell you.

514
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,160
Fei-Hong is all grown up now.

515
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,780
Someday, he will leave our house.

516
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,620
- What? - Oh, you know-

517
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,740
how cute he was when he was little.

518
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,330
But why is it wet?

519
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,400
Let me tell you. I'm glad you asked.

520
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,400
Because it was just picked this morning.

521
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,920
You're really going to enjoy the potency

522
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,920
of this one.

523
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,870
It's really powerful.

524
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,040
You just need a little bit.

525
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,170
A little brother around here could take 
his place.

526
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,370
We can talk about this later.

527
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,460
Don't be rude.

528
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,590
Please, or I will never forgive you.

529
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,500
You shouldn't talk that way to me.


530
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,140
Well, you never let me talk.

531
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,470
Honey, not now. Mr. Chan...

532
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,470
Don't you turn your back on me.

533
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,260
OK. Roll it up tight

534
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,430
to keep it nice and fresh

535
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,930
and keep it close to your heart...

536
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,100
Like that.

537
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,190
Remember what I told you and have a nice 
day.

538
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,190
Right.

539
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,350
Yes. I really do think

540
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,350
we need to talk about this now.

541
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,400
Master Wong? Thanks for the ginseng.

542
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,260
Ah. Everything is all right?

543
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,820
Just fine.

544
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,980
- I'll keep it inside. - He liked it.

545
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,350
Let me see you out.

546
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,480
Let Fei-Hong do it.

547
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,140
I can show you. Please, this way.

548
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,860
- Bye-bye, now. - Goodbye, Mr. Chan.

549
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,410
Anyway, as I was saying

550
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,570
before Mr. Chan interrupted us,

551
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,080
it's time you thought about this.

552
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,080
I don't know what you're trying to tell 
me.

553
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,620
Mother, Mr. Chan's gone.

554
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,620
Oh, thank God.

555
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,950
What's this all about?

556
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,320
Look, if you don't want to talk about 
this

557
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,920
right now, I understand.

558
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You've had a really long trip,

559
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,030
and you should get some rest.

560
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,160
Come on. Let's sit down.

561
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,500
Yes, Father. Please take a rest.

562
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,170
It's a good idea.

563
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,380
I better start taking better care of 
myself.

564
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,040
I need to realise I'm not getting any 
younger.

565
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,540
Well? Why do you make that look?

566
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,220
Because I'm afraid he'll find the tree.

567
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,220
Don't be silly. Throw the pot away.

568
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,340
That's not all.

569
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,380
What?

570
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,300
What happens when Mr. Chan drinks the tea

571
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,430
made from those roots?

572
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,980
Ho ho ho! So he will get a little dizzy.

573
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,220
He's going to have the time of his 
life.

574
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,190
I wish I could say the same.

575
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,560
All right, all right. That's it for 
me.

576
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,850
See you tomorrow.

577
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,320
Hey, thanks for bringing it down.

578
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,120
Ho Sang, she's cooling down.

579
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,080
Can you give me some more fire?

580
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,200
Just give me one minute.

581
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,030
Stand back.

582
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,130
That was great. Thanks for the light.

583
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,800
Almost quitting time.

584
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,840
After this, I ought to.

585
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,210
That's it!

586
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,850
See you tomorrow.

587
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,610
Hey!

588
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,360
Get them back to work.

589
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,560
But why?

590
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,900
Go!

591
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,480
I'm the new foreman here. Now ring the 
bell.

592
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,070
Go on.

593
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,700
Yes, sir.

594
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,450
Hey, Ho Sang,

595
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,410
what the hell you doing now?

596
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,080
Yeah, what are you, out of your mind?

597
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,580
Sorry.

598
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,870
I was just told that we have a new 
foreman here.

599
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,500
New foreman?

600
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,700
Well-

601
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,180
we seem to have fallen behind this month,

602
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,140
so everybody works the night shift

603
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,420
for one month.

604
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,340
What? Extra shifts?

605
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,760
Hey, hold on.

606
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,440
So, let's say we work

607
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,430
all those overtime hours for you-

608
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,800
then we need overtime pay.

609
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,980
Quiet.

610
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,610
You give us no choice.

611
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,240
You either work the overtime,

612
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,740
or we close the steel mill down,

613
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,640
and you'll all be without jobs.

614
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,900
Now, you can take it or leave it.

615
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,910
Mr. Smith, you can't blackmail us anymore.

616
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,110
We worked hard for you,

617
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,660
and now we've had enough!

618
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,750
We quit!

619
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,170
Hold it!

620
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,290
Nobody is to leave.

621
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,240
You'll stay and work.

622
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,370
Do you understand that?

623
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,250
You can take my job,

624
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,590
but you can't run my life!

625
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,870
You think you can make us?

626
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,680
Who you think you are? Let's go!

627
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,850
Don't move!

628
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,300
You're in our way!

629
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,730
All of you, right now! Get back to work!

630
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,480
Strike breaker!

631
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,150
That's enough!

632
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,860
Aah!

633
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,760
Aah!

634
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,230
Free him!

635
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,600
Ahh! Ohh!

636
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,030
Get him!

637
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,280
Aah!

638
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,570
Everyone up! Back to work!

639
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,990
Great!

640
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,210
You see? He's very persuasive.

641
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,750
They're going to get right back to work.

642
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,080
Ha ha ha!

643
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,750
Huhh!

644
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,340
No, again.

645
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,500
- Ki-yah! - Huhh!

646
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,870
Ki-yah!

647
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,550
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

648
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,010
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

649
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,220
Ki-yah!

650
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,420
Ki-yah!

651
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,750
Ki-yah!

652
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,640
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

653
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,630
Black Tiger Slash! Ha! Ki-yah!

654
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,180
Ki-yah!

655
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,590
OK, now! Clean!

656
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,310
It's bloody impossible to sleep with all 
this noise.

657
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,640
Why don't we just buy it and have it 
bulldozed?

658
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,230
You know that we've been through this 
before.

659
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,740
Mr. Wong refuses to sell.

660
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,850
It's ruining my life,

661
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,770
so why don't you go and do something 
about it?

662
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,900
Yes, sir.

663
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,340
I'll catch you later!

664
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,740
Hey, Fun, you're working too hard.

665
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,160
You need husband to run that snake stand,
 huh?

666
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,630
Perfect job for me, huh?

667
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,960
Ha ha ha ha!

668
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,250
A husband, huh?

669
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,960
Yeah. I bet you'd be running away

670
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,640
from these snakes all day.

671
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,800
Come on, now.

672
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,710
Why would I want to pay some lazy man

673
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,180
when I can do it better, huh?



674
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,890
You know, you make good point.

675
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,630
But seriously now, Fun,

676
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,940
you know, you don't have man around,

677
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,510
so I worry about your safety.

678
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,930
Hey, Fun, I've been thinking...

679
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,940
Let me teach you kung fu.

680
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,930
How about drunken boxing?

681
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,320
Where did you get that idea?

682
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,910
No one does that.

683
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,190
If you really want to fight,

684
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,360
I teach you the Choy Li Fu boxing style.

685
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,190
Oh, wise man speak.

686
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,360
What you looking at?

687
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,410
Get back to work.

688
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,460
We've got customers waiting.

689
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,710
They need the help now.

690
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,870
Yellowtail!

691
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,590
Yellowtail? OK.

692
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,950
Drunken boxing.

693
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,700
What does she know anyway?

694
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,910
Hey, Chang Tsan.

695
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,340
Huh?

696
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,340
What, Fei-Hong?

697
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,720
A fillet of salmon

698
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,330
and a pound of fish marrow, OK?

699
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,050
Hey, where are you going?

700
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,550
Really soft skin,

701
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,670
but the meat is tougher.

702
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:25,390
Hey, Fun, I'm going to need a few things,
 OK?

703
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,140
- Ohh! - Hi.

704
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,150
Oh, it's getting away.

705
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,440
Oh! Ha ha ha!

706
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,650
One pheasant and two orders of har gow.

707
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,320
Ah, that would've been my choice.

708
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,390
I've been waiting for a long time.

709
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,860
- Here. - Thank you.

710
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,360
You want this or not?

711
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,070
I got a customer waiting.

712
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,270
Oh, yeah. I'll be right there.

713
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,530
Oh, Fei-Hong.

714
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,770
I hear drunken boxing is the best.

715
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,150
Would you be able to teach me?

716
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,330
How about it?

717
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,910
Of course. Anytime.

718
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,160
Hey!

719
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,960
How about I bone it for you, eh?

720
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,380
Oh, no. That's all right.

721
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,570
How about later with that?

722
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,170
We're discussing drunken boxing.

723
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,660
Fei-Hong, when do you think you could 
teach me?

724
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,800
Anytime would be fine. You just let me 
know.

725
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,220
Fun, you need real instructor

726
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,760
to learn how to fight.

727
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,340
Maybe Chang Tsan can give you a lesson.

728
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,010
He doesn't teach the style I like.

729
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,260
It's for fighting.

730
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,010
Drunken master just for show.

731
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,730
You cannot win fight that way.

732
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,020
Forget him. He's jealous.

733
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,010
I like your style.

734
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,260
Fei-Hong, time to admit it.

735
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,520
Your drunken boxing is no match for Choy 
Li Fu.

736
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,600
Isn't that right? You agree?

737
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,240
Yeah! Right! That's right.

738
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,740
Master much better.

739
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,770
He knows.

740
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,280
Depends on who's fighting.

741
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,820
What do you say to a challenge, then?

742
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,780
Out of my way.

743
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,000
My Choy Li Fu, your drunken boxing.

744
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,660
And if I lose, you can have your fish

745
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,500
and anything else you want no charge, on 
me.

746
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,170
Listen-

747
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,670
you can learn from Fei-Hong.

748
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,820
I don't need your help.

749
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,920
I appreciate the offer,

750
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,260
but there's too many people here,

751
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,410
and somebody could get hurt.

752
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,670
No way, Fei-Hong. You're going to fight 
this time.

753
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,500
Attention, everybody!

754
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,390
Listen!

755
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,680
I'm Chang Tsan, and this is Wong Fei- 
Hong.

756
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,850
It's your lucky day.

757
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,170
I have challenged him to a fight.

758
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,190
Come on.

759
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,220
I'll hold this.

760
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,390
Remember, it's an exhibition match,

761
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,900
so go on.

762
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,980
Hah! Hah! Hi! Hyah!

763
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,480
Oh.

764
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,330
Drunken boxing.

765
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,660
Haah!

766
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,900
Ah!

767
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,570
OK, OK, that's enough.

768
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,450
All right, that's enough. The winner is 
Fei-Hong.

769
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,020
No. Really, it was a draw.

770
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,020
I think Chang Tsan would agree.

771
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,150
It's not over yet.

772
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,040
Fei-Hong!

773
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,290
Yeah, I'm coming! It's my stepma.

774
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,120
- Come on! - I got to go. Thank 
you, Fun.

775
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,200
See you tomorrow.

776
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,200
- Fish. - Why, thank you.

777
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,670
What do I owe you for this?

778
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
You can have it.

779
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,580
Thanks a lot.

780
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,420
Thank you. Excuse me.

781
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,640
Everyone saw it was a draw, right?

782
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,630
OK, OK, show over.

783
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,520
Don't tell me you were fighting for food 
again.

784
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,520
Me? No way.

785
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
You know your father will kill you

786
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,850
if he hears about it.

787
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,060
How can I replace the ginseng?

788
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,480
Pawn my diamond necklace, that's how.

789
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,510
But, why?

790
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,640
We'll be in big trouble

791
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,860
if Mr. Chan decides to brew that tree 
root.

792
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,950
You would do that?

793
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,020
Just remember, you owe me one.

794
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,030
Yeah.

795
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,910
Hey, that's the guy we're looking for.

796
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,030
Stay close to him while I go and get the 
boss, OK?

797
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,370
Yes, sir.

798
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,500
 Stop here.

799
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,830
Ah, OK, here's the money.

800
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,200
I'm sure they're high quality.

801
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,210
She got them from her husband.

802
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,250
Look, I'm late already. Let's go, OK?

803
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,960
So, was the drought very serious?

804
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,250
In that province,

805
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,250
rice and grain were scarce before there 
was a drought.

806
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,750
With no rainfall, there will be no 
harvest,

807
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,090
and that is serious.

808
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,350
We must act now.

809
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,600
It's so bad.

810
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,100
They're so poor that some families

811
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,890
have to share a single pair of pants.

812
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,560
Wow. Who gets to wear them?



813
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,550
If you have job, you wear the pants.

814
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,520
Oh, wow.

815
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,770
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

816
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,230
It's all right. How are you?

817
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,350
Good to see you.

818
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,230
Fei-Hong, don't you think we should be 
going?

819
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,810
Aren't you meeting my wife for tea?

820
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,310
Oh, no, not mah-jongg again.

821
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,440
How can you say that?

822
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,450
It's our fund-raising meeting,

823
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,360
and you were supposed to remind me.

824
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,160
Oh, I almost forgot. We'd better be 
going.

825
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,580
Ah. You don't want to keep them waiting.

826
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,580
You should go.

827
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,530
Of course. You're right.

828
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,820
- Bye. - Goodbye.

829
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,830
Good day.

830
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,830
No mah-jongg!

831
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,900
Yes, sir.

832
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,960
This guy over here.

833
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,800
Go tell John.

834
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,120
It's been called to our attention

835
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,590
that Master Wong needs us to lend him 
some money.

836
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,970
Oh, no, no, no. That's not for me.

837
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,430
I'm sure I speak for everyone.

838
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,430
We'll just take up a collection.

839
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,460


Did you hear what I said?

840
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,380
I don't personally need any of your 
money.

841
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,470
It's for the drought victims.

842
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,470
But your wife...

843
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,220
Look, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

844
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,310
This could happen to you.

845
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,810
I say if Mr. Wong needs money...

846
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,720
Nothing right now.

847
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,730
You sure?

848
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,730
You better not have said anything,

849
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,070
you understand?

850
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,480
I won't tell a soul.

851
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,150
Besides, she's the one that talks a lot.

852
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,740
Like you don't?

853
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,700
How dare you say that? I only told my 
sister...

854
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,490
Qu doesn't even know I came here.

855
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,730
Whoa, ladies, somebody has been talking.

856
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,950
They always lie to me. Look at their 
faces.

857
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,540
Now, that's enough.

858
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,610
Can't we just take a look?

859
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,740
Let's see.

860
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,750
There.

861
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,900
Hey, careful!

862
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,660
Oh, so beautiful.

863
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,250
Oh, don't handle it like that.

864
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,620
And I'm only borrowing the money.

865
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,090
You're going to have to give it back to 
me.

866
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,250
I know, I know. I understand.

867
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,630
Come on. Show it to us.

868
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,640
Here.

869
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,220
So, did you get it?

870
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,510
No. I haven't actually seen it,

871
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,140
but I'm sure they have it.

872
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,050
Well, we can't waste any more time.

873
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,310
Grab the seal, and we'll meet you out 
front.

874
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,050
OK, grab it, and I'll see you outside.

875
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,140
Oh, you're so lucky.

876
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,570
You're lucky.

877
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,360
Ah, it's so beautiful on you.

878
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,860
Hey, wait!

879
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,190
The necklace is gone.

880
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,870
You've got to learn to speak up.

881
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,770
Stop him!

882
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,410
Stop him!

883
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,000
Stop! Come on!

884
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,540
Let's go!

885
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,710
Huh?

886
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,630
Leave it.

887
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,580
Fei-Hong!

888
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,680
It's over there!

889
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,760
He went that way! Go!

890
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,960
Excuse me!

891
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,050
Excuse me!

892
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,060
You better run.

893
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,690
Fei-Hong, you're my hero!

894
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,970
Oh, you are a hero.

895
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,180
Hey, Fei-Hong.

896
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,200
You see that?

897
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,940
Atta way.

898
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,160
What's this?

899
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,270
You bumped me.

900
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,570
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

901
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,910
No. That's not good enough.

902
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,250
Did I miss something?

903
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,540
Get on your knees and bow... right now.

904
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,620
What? You must be out of your mind.

905
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,660
Leave him alone.

906
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,910
You were in on it. I saw the whole thing.

907
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,510
Why don't you mind your own business, 
bitch?



908
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,410
Hey, who you calling bitch?

909
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,760
I can't let him get away with that.

910
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,180
And who the hell do you think you are

911
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,760
strutting around here like a peacock

912
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,340
in that bad English suit of yours?

913
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,890
I think I should kick your ass.

914
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,850
Oh, yeah?

915
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,050
Wait! Uhh!

916
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,170
Uhh.

917
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:08,270
Mom, are you all right?

918
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,260
Go away.

919
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,390
I want this guy. I can taste it.


920
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,190
Hey, hey, take it easy. You'll be OK.

921
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,770
Oh, she wants to fight?

922
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,940
We'll take the two of you.

923
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,260
What? You're going to start this again?

924
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,900
What'd you say?

925
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,180
I said, kick his ass!

926
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
You want me to go kick...

927
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,320
You will, or I will.

928
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,320
All right.

929
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,780
Oh, what happened?

930
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,810
I'm all right.

931
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,330
He's a very good fighter.

932
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,460
The necklace is inside. It's going to be 
ruined!

933
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,490
The necklace?

934
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,790
Fei-Hong! Over here, Fei- Hong!

935
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,420
Here.

936

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,390
Where'd he learn to do that?

937
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,930
Po Chi Lam.

938
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,670
He does drunken boxing, doesn't he?

939
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,020
Oh, well, then, maybe he'll give us

940
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,980
an exhibition on drunken boxing.

941
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,340
All right.

942
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,440
Whatever you want. Fei-Hong! Come here!

943
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,480
All right-

944
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,150
time for drunken boxing.

945
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,490
What about Father?

946
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,520
I'll take care of him.

947
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,150
Besides, it will be great publicity

948
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,150
for the school.

949
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,320
Your dad will be happy.

950
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,280
OK.

951
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,780
Drunken boxing!

952
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,280
All right, what are you scared of?

953
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,620
Four of you guys can't beat one?

954
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,880
Get him!

955
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,380
Waah!

956
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,310
What is that, huh?

957
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,310
It's drunken boxing.

958
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,310
Oh.

959
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,270
Come on, now. What do you think?

960
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:58,270
Well, can he do more?

961
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,640
Of course he can. Yeah.

962
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,640
Hey, you're a bunch of fools.

963
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,020
Come on.

964
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,390
Oh. Let's go.

965
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,430
Wait for us.

966
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,400
Take as much as you can carry.

967
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,350
OK.

968
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,650
Hey, who's going to pay for that?

969
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,200
Master Wong's charge account.

970
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,200
All right, then.

971
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,000
Hey, where'd they go?

972
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,030
Over there, I think.

973
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,860
- Let's go. - Wait for us! Hurry, ladies!

974
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,090
What are they doing?

975
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,300
What's that?

976
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,800
Don't know.

977
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,500
Oh! I'm going to call the police.

978
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,680
Don't do that.

979
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,840
Fei-Hong, I brought you some help.

980
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:37,840
But Father will kill me.

981
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,800
You can blame it all on me.

982
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,840
You're going to lose if you don't,

983
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,850
so just go ahead.

984
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,180
Yeah.

985
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,260
Here you go... another bottle.


986
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,060
Aah!

987
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,480
Two at once?

988
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,640
Do you think that's a good idea?

989
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,020
Don't worry. It gives him power.

990
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,480
Yaah!

991
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,380
Ow!

992
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,630
Ow!

993
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,090
Uhh!

994
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,430
Ohh!

995
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,270
Are you all right?

996
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,180
What?

997
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,190
One more drink would be helpful.

998
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,900
Here is the very last bottle.

999
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,490
Yii!

1000
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,520
You, get up!

1001
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,620
Ow! What the hell was that?

1002
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,460
What does it mean

1003
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,570
when there's a picture of a skull?

1004
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,210
Oh. Good stuff.

1005
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,600
The last one really hit the spot.

1006
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,600
Whoo!

1007
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,760
Monkey Drinks Master's Wine.

1008
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,890
That was Crazy Corkscrew

1009
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,020
Open Wine Bottle.

1010
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,740
White Tiger Washes Face.

1011
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,120
Turn the Barrel!

1012
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,660
What's wrong? You have a hangover?

1013
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,080
Kill him!

1014
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,900
Do you like Drunken Monkey?

1015
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,250
Ee-hee!

1016
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,840
Ay!

1017
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,630
Ah, Eagle Carries Wine Bottle.

1018
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,660
Got you now!

1019
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,340
Attack! Waterfall!

1020
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,880
That one there, I showed him.

1021
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,380
Here is Peter Piper Playing the Flute.

1022
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,890
Mmm! Ooh! Ha ha ha!

1023
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,130
Oh, that's a good one.

1024
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,720
Down the Hatch!

1025
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,100
Wheelbarrow.

1026
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,780
Ahh!

1027
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,450
Drunken Maid Flirting With the Master.

1028
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,780
- Aah! - Snake Eyes.

1029
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,840
Ohh!

1030
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,710
And this one?

1031
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,670
Uh, Gypsy Wine.

1032
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,170
It's called Gypsy what?

1033
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,630
Just watch.

1034
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,050
Aah!

1035
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,340
Uncle Stirs the Barrel.

1036
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,550
Come back!

1037
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:17,560
Fei-Hong!

1038
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:18,590
He can't even stand up straight!

1039
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,720
Find some more wine.

1040
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:20,730
Of course.

1041
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,730
Aah!

1042
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,690
Master Wong! What's going on here?

1043
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,350
Those men are attacking Fei-Hong!

1044
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,150
Hold this. Fei-Hong!

1045
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,770
Fei-Hong!

1046
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,280
Smash Bottle Against the Wall!

1047
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,160
Oh, no!

1048
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,240
Fei-Hong!

1049
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,120
- Ha ha! - Have you been drinking?

1050
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,670
You stop it right now!

1051
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,290
Down the Hatch!

1052
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,090
What are you doing?

1053
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,970
Uh, Father?

1054
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,100
Ohh...

1055
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,720
Ha ha! You have the cutest little nose.

1056
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,390
Look how well they get along.

1057
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,850
How are you, Dad?

1058
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,150
Fighting again!

1059
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,690
Fighting? OK.

1060
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,510
You should have been here.

1061
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,350
Fei-Hong defeated all five of those 
gangsters.

1062
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,240
What was this all about?

1063
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,740
They tried to steal the diamond necklace

1064
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,990
that Ling sold to me.

1065
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,610
What?

1066
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,860
You sold your diamond necklace?

1067
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,450
Why didn't you tell us Po Chi Lam needed 
more money?

1068
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,650
We would have helped you. You know we're 
all friends here.

1069
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,580
No. The school doesn't need money.

1070
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,990
Here, you can take charge of the funds 
we raised.

1071
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,590
Stop that! Fei-Hong!

1072
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,130
- Hi. - Hello, Madam Wong.

1073
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,500
I said stop it!

1074
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,330
No, please, Master Wong, don't hurt him!

1075
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,340
He's drunk!

1076
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,330
Mom, fetch me another bottle.

1077
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:48,630
Go home now!

1078
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,050
Now!

1079
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,100
Yes, dear.

1080
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,770
Do as he says. All right.

1081
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,970
See you.

1082
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,730
 Go home now, Daddy 

1083
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:06,680
Go on. Follow him!

1084
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,150
Losers.

1085
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,740
You didn't do any better.

1086
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,490
And what were you trying to do?

1087
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,400
You've ruined the school's reputation!

1088
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,610
They think we're broke!

1089
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,080
And you, you idiot, what have I told you

1090
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,910
about drunken boxing and fighting in the 
streets?

1091
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,790
Now, tell me, is everything here so bad

1092
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,110
you have to sell your diamonds?

1093
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,950
Come on! Do you really think

1094
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,580
I would have sold something

1095
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:29,040
that's precious to us? I would never!

1096
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,340
Don't lie to me!

1097
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,410
How much money did you lose playing mah-
jongg?

1098
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,700
Well, how much?

1099
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,510
I always win at mah-jongg.

1100
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,930
You don't know what you're talking about.

1101
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,470
Besides, who are you going to believe,

1102
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,500
me or friends?

1103
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,890
Stepma, I believe you.

1104
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,880
Shut up!

1105
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,220
Did you hear what I told you? Shut up!

1106
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,770
You disobeyed me!

1107
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,300
I said absolutely no fighting and no 
drinking.

1108
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,860
And above all, no drunken boxing!

1109
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,820
You even fought with me, your own father!

1110
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,900
You disgraced your family name!

1111
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,810
Wait! Wait! Hold on!

1112
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,820
Would you stop hitting him?

1113
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,240
He was just defending me!

1114
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,780
They tried to break my jaw.

1115
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,370
I guess that's something you don't care 
about.

1116
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,700
Damn you, woman! It was forbidden!

1117
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,830
They could have killed him. Don't you 
care about that?

1118
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,790
Oh, sure. Like it matters.

1119
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,910
You're beating him worse than those guys 
ever did.

1120
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,800
You're driving me insane!

1121
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,540
I can't believe this!

1122
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,290
What's this?

1123
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,300
Oh, my God!

1124
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:40,640
What has happened to my 300- year-old 
bonsai?

1125
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,350
Damn it! I forgot to throw it out!

1126
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,850
Mr. Cho!

1127
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,810
Aah!

1128
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,770
What went wrong?

1129
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,230
You know this garden is your 
responsibility

1130
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,390
and I expect an answer! Well?

1131
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:54,640
Just hold on!

1132
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,030
You shouldn't blame everything on him 
that way,

1133
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,120
because I was actually the one who did 
it.

1134
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,540
I was practising my kung fu

1135
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,190
and then I tripped over that statue 
right over there.

1136
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,450
Luckily, the tree was there to grab.

1137
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,200
God only knows, I could have gotten 
killed,

1138
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,590
but I see now you don't care. Oh, well.

1139
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:13,990
You know that's not it, Ling.

1140
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,800
I am so sick and tired of your deception!

1141
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,590
If you're going to hit me, just go on.

1142
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:23,840
You know, that's not a bad idea.

1143
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,260
It's time you showed me respect.

1144
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,930
That's not gonna work this time!

1145
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,360
You've been hurting me so I won't cause 
any more trouble.

1146
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,900
You're driving me out of my mind!

1147
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,530
Aah!

1148
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:46,020
Hit me! Hit me all right!

1149
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,110
Over the head! Kill me!

1150
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,020
Kill me and the little one inside me!

1151
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,190
Little one?

1152
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,320
Is that so?

1153
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:53,950
We're going to have a baby?


1154
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,820
Why didn't you tell me?

1155
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:59,570
- Never! - Come inside.

1156
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,710
You told me to get on my knees, so here 
I am!

1157
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:05,490
On my knees! It doesn't matter if I'm 
pregnant!

1158
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:08,790
Mom has a little baby!

1159
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,700
I apologise. I wouldn't hit you.

1160
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,680
Get away! You said enough!

1161
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,080
Ling, no! You will hurt the baby!

1162
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,590
- Then put me down! - OK.

1163
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,800
Leave me alone, I said!

1164
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,460
No! You have to stop this!

1165
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,100
All right, I will.

1166
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,220
Are you all right?

1167
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,730
There's no way I'll forgive you!

1168
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,230
What are you doing?

1169
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,860
This is all my fault. Please be careful.

1170
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,320
Get Madam a chair! Quickly!

1171
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,190
What are you waiting for?

1172
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,650
I'm begging you, Ling.

1173
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,530
Sit over there, you'll be all right.

1174
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,240
- Aah! - Ling!

1175
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,110
Oh! Sorry.

1176
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,370
Ling, I'm so sorry.

1177
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,620
How dare you?!

1178
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,660
Oh, it was an accident, Ling.

1179
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,660
Let me help you.

1180
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,910
You did it on purpose.

1181
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,290
Now, of course I didn't.

1182
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:54,490
Don't lie. Haven't you done enough?

1183
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,620
Is the baby all right?

1184
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,170
Stop it!

1185
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:00,090
Eee. Ooh. Ugh.

1186
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,550
It's fine.

1187
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:03,590
Good. Are you comfortable?

1188
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,050
Master Wong, Mrs.. Chan is here.

1189
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,010
She has a bit of a problem.

1190
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,590
You stay right here. I'll be right back.

1191
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,800
Congratulations, Father. I'm really 
proud of you.

1192
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,640
Thank you.

1193
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,350
Ah, Mrs. Chan, it's such a pleasure.

1194
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,570
Dr. Wong, uh, this really isn't ginseng.

1195
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,030
I showed it to another doctor

1196
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,070
and he says it's poisonous.

1197
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,200
Now, I'm not sure where you got it,

1198
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,940
but you've surely been misled.

1199
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,410
It has made my husband deathly ill.

1200
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:36,410
Mrs. Thank God he only brewed half 
of it.

1201
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:39,070
You owe me, and you're going to have to

1202
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,120
take the blame for this mess. Now!

1203
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,320
Mm-hmm.

1204
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,920
Forgive me. Uncle Ho, get the snake 
extract.

1205
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,830
I can assure you he will recover

1206
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,090
if you give him this.

1207
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:53,130
Ah, Dr. Wong, oh, this is wonderful.

1208
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,830
I promise I won't tell anyone.

1209
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,970
It must have been a mistake.

1210
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,430
Good day, madam.

1211
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,750
Mrs. Good day.

1212
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,220
Well?

1213
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,600
Mmm.

1214
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,710
Get over here, Cho!

1215
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,190
What's this?

1216
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:15,020
He did it! Fei-Hong!

1217
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,690
How could you do such a thing?

1218
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,270
Are you out of your mind?

1219
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,040
You are destroying my reputation!

1220
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,950
Here you go, Father. You dropped your 
bonsai tree.

1221
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,960
That's it! I'm gonna kill you!

1222
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,760
Ruin me! Drunk!

1223
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,210
Wait, Wong, don't! Aah!

1224
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,050
Hurt my friends! That's it!

1225
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:50,890
Just listen! It was stolen off the train

1226
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:52,710
and he couldn't get it back!

1227
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,470
Oh, shit. What am I saying?

1228
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,510
See, he was trying to save you some tax.

1229
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,980
How would he have known the ginseng 
would be stolen?

1230
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,970
The ginseng was stolen?

1231
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,300
Even so, he still lied to me!

1232
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,610
No! Not acceptable!

1233
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,110
You shouldn't defend him!

1234
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,350
He's a thief and a drunk. Just stay out 
of it!

1235
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,320
I'm thirsty.

1236
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,430
Oh, yeah?

1237
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,860
You like some wine? Just stay right 
there.

1238
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:27,120
I'll give you some wine. Come on, open 
up.

1239
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,000
Come on, drink!

1240
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,510
Stop it, Wong! Stop!

1241
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,170
No more! What are you doing?

1242
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:46,420
Aaah!

1243
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,640
You're going to fight me now?

1244
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,630
I disown you!

1245
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:54,010
You are not my son!

1246
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,430
Now, get out!

1247
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,100
You better do as I say!

1248
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:02,360
Get out!

1249
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,200
Come on! Get out of here!

1250
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,120
Stop it! That's enough!

1251
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,400
You're going to kill him!

1252
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,380
That's enough, Wong!

1253
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,340
Fei-Hong! Fei-Hong!

1254
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,420
Please, don't! Please!

1255
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:32,340
You're killing him, Wong, can't you see?

1256
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,340
I don't care! I want him out!

1257
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:37,550
Father!

1258
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,350
Up! Get out of here!

1259
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:43,060
Aah!

1260
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,860
That was self-defence! He didn't mean to 
do it!

1261
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,280
Tell your father you're sorry!

1262
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,180
Out!

1263
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,860
Now!

1264
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,200
Fei-Hong! Come back!

1265
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,490
After him, Cho! Don't let him go!

1266
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,320
Cho!

1267
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,290
That way.

1268
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,660
Oh, yes.

1269
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,340
How many you want?

1270
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,540
Excuse me, sir. Where can I find 
the herbal shop?

1271
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,670
Right down on left.

1272
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,220
Thank you. Here you go.

1273
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,180
Hello. Beer, please.

1274
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,810
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

1275
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,310
I've never seen you drink so much.

1276
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,340
You know your father's going to be

1277
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,980
very angry with you, Fei-Hong.

1278
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,610
Let's not talk about this.

1279
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:42,430
Bring me another drink.

1280
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,610
Keep it coming.

1281
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,770
Ah, no way. That's it for tonight.

1282
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,280
Ahh.

1283
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,360
Excuse me, miss?

1284
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,520
I want a song here.


1285
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,280
Something I should sing?

1286
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,900
The Ocean's Crying, but I sing it.

1287
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,780
You play for me now?

1288
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,420
OK.

1289
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:10,460
Mmm.

1290
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,700
 I am so sent down 

1291
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,090
 I was so happy and now 

1292
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,210
 I'm all alone with no home 

1293
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,100
 What can I do? 

1294
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:26,060
 If not for the wine 

1295
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:30,440
 I'd be hurting all the time 

1296
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,900
 If only I could go home 

1297
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:38,520
 Father, listen to me now 

1298
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:41,770
 What can I do to make it up 

1299
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,030
 To make you proud 

1300
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,230
 Make you proud 

1301
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:52,030
 I only tried to help 

1302
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,670
 When I saw the bonsai tree 

1303
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,870
 I thought I was so smart 

1304
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,160
 Why did you... 

1305
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,490
There he is, right over there.

1306
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,130
He doesn't look so bad.

1307
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,630
Oh, yes, he is.

1308
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,470
He's real tough. A fighter.

1309
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:10,180
Well, let's just see about this.

1310
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,170
 I still love you 

1311
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,840
 No matter what you... 

1312
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,170
Party's over. I suggest you go.

1313
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:19,430
 No matter what you do 

1314
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,150
What? You stop that!

1315
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:23,270
 Love you 

1316
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:24,820
You shut up! Listen to me!

1317
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,310
The rest of you, go on home!

1318
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,570
Go on! Get out of here!

1319
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,560
Yeah. You gotta leave.

1320
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,070
Go on. Move!

1321
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,560
Let's get out of the way.

1322
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:38,080
What happened to the music?

1323
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,450
- Oh! - Aah!

1324
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,710
Are you the drunken boxer?

1325
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:52,240
Sure. I'm pretty drunk,

1326
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,700
but I don't know about boxing.

1327
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,700
He's just faking.

1328
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,420
Hyah!

1329
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,930
Come on. What's the matter with 
you?

1330
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,630
Get up and fight me!

1331
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,930
That's Fei-Hong.

1332
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,730
Out of my way! What are you doing?

1333
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,730
Hey.

1334
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:19,230
It's none of your goddam business.

1335
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,270
Aah!

1336
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:26,280
Get him out!

1337
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,030
What's going on? Is this some kind of 
joke?

1338
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,070
No! You should have seen him!

1339
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,240
He couldn't be stopped. Ask anyone.

1340
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,150
I'll stop him.

1341
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,460
We finished him!

1342
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,430
Ha ha! Why you kick me?

1343
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:53,550
Look at you. Get up and fight me! Come 
on!

1344
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,390
Get this drunk out of my sight!

1345
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,210
Go! Go on! Kill him!

1346
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,470
No, wait. Not yet.

1347
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,840
Don't kill him, teach him a lesson.

1348
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,680
All right, you've had it now.

1349
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:07,020
Careful, he's tricky!

1350
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,610
Fei-Hong.

1351
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:12,980
He's hurt bad, yeah.

1352
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:14,980
Girl: Come.

1353
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:17,900
Ooh, that's bad. Let's go.

1354
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,190
Oh, God.

1355

00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,450
Fei-Hong!

1356
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:27,820
Up there!

1357
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:28,860
Wang!

1358
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,870
Get him! Cut him down!

1359
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:48,280
Fei-Hong, don't be ashamed.

1360
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:52,760
When we were kids, we used to go naked 
all the time.

1361
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,050
I should have found you sooner.

1362
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:58,500
You'll be OK. Just give it some time.

1363
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,920
By the way...

1364
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,220
I have some good news, too.

1365
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:07,890
Just listen to me. Guess what.

1366
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,760
Every woman in town wants to be your 
wife.

1367
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:12,550
It's the truth.

1368
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,680
Hey, all right. Come on.

1369
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:17,600
Dry your eyes.

1370
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,570
Father...

1371
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:20,650
I know.

1372
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,900
I have a good reason to forbid drunken 
boxing.

1373
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:29,250
Those who practice it frequently wind up 
as alcoholics.

1374
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,740
Not if one uses restraint and self- 
discipline.

1375
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,900
But that's more difficult than you might 
think.

1376
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It's true that alcohol can make 
the body loose

1377
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,580
and its pain threshold higher,

1378
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,920
but it's difficult to drink the proper 
amount.

1379
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:45,220
Many drunken boxers become nothing more

1380
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,260
than drunken fools.

1381
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,220
The odds of bringing shame and disgrace

1382
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,420
upon oneself and one's family is just 
too great.

1383
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:55,090
It also reminds me there is an ancient 
proverb

1384
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:58,050
that equates the drinking of alcohol 
with water-

1385
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:01,430
"Boats can float on water," or so it 
says,

1386
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,400
"but they can sink in it, too."

1387
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,020
Now, that's a profound lesson.

1388
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,510
I have only one question.

1389
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,530
What?

1390
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,150
Whose boat are we talking about?

1391
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,840
I will never drink again.

1392
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:42,090
Ah, there, there, Fei-Hong.

1393
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,920
I'm glad to see that you're OK now.


1394
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:45,970
Come on, let's get up and thank all your 
friends here

1395
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,960
for helping you. Go on.

1396
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,020
Ho Sang: Fei-Hong, you OK?

1397
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,770
Thank you.

1398
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,150
You OK?

1399
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,610
You should...

1400
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,980
Don't ever give up. You'll be 
better now.

1401
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:00,470
Everybody makes mistakes.

1402
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:01,940
How's the baby today?

1403
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,850
He's just fine. Let him be.

1404
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,440
Oh. All right.

1405
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,380
Sorry, we are closed now.

1406
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,660
Where's Fei-Hong?

1407
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,700
Excuse me?

1408
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,000
Is he here?

1409
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,830
He might be. What for?

1410
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,470
It's private.

1411
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,340
May I come in?

1412
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:39,840
Well, in that case...

1413
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,880
I know who sent you.

1414
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,150
What was that for? Keep your distance.

1415
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:49,400
That's enough. I want you to leave.

1416
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,070
Hmm.

1417
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,120
You know, you're not bad.

1418
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,240
Huh? It's you!

1419
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,290
You!

1420
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,340
Fei-Hong, hold him for me!

1421
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,380
Unh!

1422
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,800
Help.

1423
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:28,430
Father, help!

1424
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,260
- Help him! - That's enough!

1425
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:32,310
Hurting me! Aah!

1426
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:34,270
Fei-Hong, are you all right?

1427
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,900
Yeah, I was just pretending.

1428
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:36,980
Fei-Hong, who is that?

1429
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:43,990
Hey!

1430
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:45,780
Fei-Hong, hold it!

1431
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,740
We have you surrounded!

1432
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,240
I'm talking to you.

1433
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,060
Yeah. Would you stop?

1434
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,560
Me?

1435
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:53,860
Please, sir, I hope you can 
forgive us.

1436
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,580
I am Wong Kei-Ying. I apologise.

1437
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:59,450
You are very famous. Meeting you is an 
honour.

1438
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,830
I am Fu Wen-Chi.

1439
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,740
Fu Wen-Chi?

1440
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:05,540
Our most decorated Manchu officer.

1441
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:07,370
Is it true?

1442
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,040
Yes, it is.

1443
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,410
It's an honour. Welcome.

1444
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:12,330
- Right this way. - Thank you.

1445
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,420
Good evening.

1446
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,800
I guess that man is someone important.

1447
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:18,880
Trust me, if he was important,

1448
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,300
he wouldn't be hitting women, would he?

1449
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:22,310
Oh.

1450
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:23,930
Think about it.

1451
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:24,930
What?

1452
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,760
Keep searching. We have to find it.

1453
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,020
Look in the parlour when you're done.

1454
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,020
Yes, ma'am.

1455
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,860
You have no idea where you left it?

1456
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,230
No, I don't.

1457
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,720
Where could it be?

1458
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:36,530
Cho might know.

1459
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,520
Hey!

1460
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:40,810
Something's wrong?

1461
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,660
Oh, it's hot tonight. I can't stand it.

1462
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,950
She's quite a handful.

1463
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:50,070
Oh, think I'll get some ice.

1464
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,240
Cho, where's the jade box I had?

1465
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:53,360
What?

1466
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,000
Where did you put it?

1467
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,540
I don't know.

1468
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:57,540
What is that?

1469
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:59,370
Ground garlic.

1470
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,510
I mean there in your hand.

1471
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,580
We found it!

1472
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,010
Fei-Hong, where are you going?

1473
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,890
- Mom! - I'm not finished with that.

1474
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,100
Fu: When you surprised me in the baggage 
car,

1475
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,800
I was trying to get back thejade seal

1476
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,210
that Ambassador Morley had stolen.

1477
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,350
I wound up with your ginseng instead.

1478
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,230
Tell me something,

1479
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:21,610
there must be a hundred jade seals in 
our museum.

1480
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,800
Is this one so special?

1481
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,820
Fei-Hong, they all are special.

1482
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,610
Think about this.

1483
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,650
Today they plunder a seal.

1484
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,640
It seems small.

1485
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:34,230
Tomorrow they take another, and the next 
thing you know,

1486
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,160
the Great Wall is gone. And what's next?

1487
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,650
Our children must travel abroad just to 
see their history.

1488
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,920
So, don't you see that you and I

1489
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,920
are the only possible defence

1490
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
from governments trying to strip us of 
our culture?

1491
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:53,340
So, I hope you can help me do this,

1492
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:57,430
if only for the future generations of 
our people.

1493
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:01,040
All right. I'll be honoured to help.

1494
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,790
Thank you, Fei-Hong.

1495
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:08,100
It's awfully quiet all of a sudden.

1496
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,100
Where is everyone?

1497
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,980
Yeah. There's no one here.

1498
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:13,690
I'll go take a look.

1499
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,230
What the...


1500
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,980
Yaah!

1501
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:26,160
- Aah! - Aah!

1502
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,730
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

1503
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,400
Uh-oh.

1504
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,240
What do we do?

1505
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,610
Follow me.

1506
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,580
Here I go!

1507
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:50,750
Get him!

1508
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:24,660
Huh?

1509
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,240
All right, lift it!

1510
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,500
Fu: Here, Fei-Hong!

1511
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:48,340
Let's go!

1512
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:05,610
- Aah! - Aah!

1513
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,820
Oh, they started.

1514
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,780
Oh, I see the fun's begun.

1515
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,490
Sounds great.

1516
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:14,440
When you have the Ax Gang, you're sure 
to get the job done.

1517
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,190
That's what we're paying for.

1518
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:24,780
Fei-Hong, here!

1519
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,880
Hai!

1520
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:09,500
Unh!

1521
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:15,780
- Huh? - Fu: Fei-Hong!

1522
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,090
Oh, my God! No!

1523
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,460
Aah!

1524
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,510
Hai! Yaah!

1525
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:42,110
Fei-Hong! Your shirt, take it off!

1526
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,650
OK!


1527
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,560
- Quickly, now, go! - This way!

1528
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:34,940
Go! Go! Move it!

1529
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:41,730
Run! Go on!

1530
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:52,120
What's this? What's going on?

1531
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,320
Don't get involved.

1532
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,240
Get on out of here.

1533
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,610
Now. Go on.

1534
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:58,630
Help.

1535
01:09:58,710 --> 01:10:00,170
That's Fu Wen-Chi!

1536
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:02,630
Unh!

1537
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,290
Ow! That hurt!

1538
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:16,890
- Hey! -

1539
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,510
Fu Wen-Chi!

1540
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:22,690
- There! - Master Fu!

1541
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:25,230
Huh? Come on! Let's go!

1542
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:28,150
Master Fu!

1543
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:31,520
- Get behind! - Help! Help!

1544
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:35,610
- Aah! - Easy, easy!

1545
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,160
Try to stop the bleeding.

1546
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,410
Don't die!

1547
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:39,980
Hold on! Master Fu!

1548
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,820
We'll go for a doctor! You'll be all 
right!

1549
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,610
The royal seal...

1550
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,070
I know. We'll get it.

1551
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,280
Don't worry. I'll find it.

1552
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:49,250
The embassy. Go quickly.

1553
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:50,740
- What do I do? - Tonight.

1554
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,780
Hold on, Master. My father will take 
care of you.

1555
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,420
I promise. Don't give up!

1556
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:00,500
No, Master Fu! Come on!

1557
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:07,340
What are you thinking?

1558
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,340
Nothing!

1559
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,710
May I give you a light?

1560
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:43,570
Hold this, please. Thanks very much.

1561
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,710
There you are.

1562
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,630
Carry on.

1563
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,260
Pick it up. What's wrong with you?

1564
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,070
- Chang Tsan? - Fei-Hong?

1565
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,670
Come on! You almost killed me!

1566
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,460
What are you doing here?

1567
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:34,660
Me? What are you doing here? Come on.

1568
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,800
I got him.

1569
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:41,760
So, where's the seal?

1570
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,090
How should I know? Let's go.

1571
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:45,170
Here.

1572
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:46,640
Thanks.

1573
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:50,710
Anybody see you?

1574
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:53,640
No. I can't see. You got a light?

1575
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,170
Of course. Hold it.

1576
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,310
Down.

1577
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:31,550
Ambassador: Looking for something?

1578
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,970
Is this what brought you here?

1579
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,290
Kneel!

1580
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:40,050
Ambassador: I hope you don't mind.

1581
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:43,090
We've taken the liberty to document your 
stay

1582
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:46,050
at our magnificent embassy.

1583
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,480
Please do enjoy our hospitality.

1584
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,880
You can go straight to hell!

1585
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,240
That's enough! Over!

1586
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,820
A winner.

1587
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,120
That'll be all, gentlemen.


1588
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,080
We'll continue the plan as scheduled.

1589
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,190
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1590
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:14,780
Thank you.

1591
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,880
Things have worked out rather well

1592
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,760
now that we have the jade seal back

1593
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,620
and a way to acquire Po Chi Lam.

1594
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,750
That's right. I've already sent

1595
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,510
the embassy photographs of Fei-Hong and 
his friend

1596
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,060
to Master Wong.

1597
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:36,430
He'll sell just like I told you.

1598
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,600
He has no choice.

1599
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,350
Make sure he understands, John,

1600
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,010
that we expect him to vacate the Po Chi 
Lam immediately,

1601
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,650
or we'll plan to execute Fei-Hong.

1602
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:47,110
Oh!

1603
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,770
Damn those boys!

1604
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:51,100
Don't they understand there's nothing we 
can do?

1605
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,770
As an embassy, they're exempt from the 
laws of China.

1606
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,690
Maybe we can reason with them. I'll go.

1607
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:58,240
Sit down! You know what they want-

1608
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,570
the rights to Po Chi Lam!

1609
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:02,540
They just wanted to return the seal.

1610
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:03,900
They aren't the criminals.

1611
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,490
- You spoiled him! - You disowned him!

1612
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,490
- This is all your fault! - This is all 
your fault!

1613
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,290
You're impossible.

1614
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,250
And you're his father.

1615
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,050
We're running out of time. We've got to 
do something.

1616
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:15,000
You're right.

1617
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,160
I refuse.

1618
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,630
How can I?

1619
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,750
You know this land has been in our 
family for centuries.

1620
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,170
There has always been a school here.

1621
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:26,930
What would you do, just give it up?

1622
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:29,420
I'll never do it.

1623
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,480
Oh, really? What would his mother have 
done?

1624
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,840
I bet I know!

1625
01:15:36,610 --> 01:15:40,730
Sister, I need your wisdom

1626
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,140
more than ever.

1627
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,560
What can we do for Fei-Hong?

1628
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:48,110
Can you help us?

1629
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,420
Release them.

1630
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,410
You may let them go.

1631
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,550
You OK?

1632
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:16,390
Just go on.

1633
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:18,180
Tsan.

1634
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:19,140
I'm grateful.

1635
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:22,140
Are you hurt? OK.

1636
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,230

Stepmom.

1637
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:24,940
Just look at you.

1638
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:27,970
I'm gonna be all right.

1639
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:29,520
Madam Wong.

1640
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:31,180
Are you OK, Master?

1641
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,100
Some bruises, but I'll be fine.

1642
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:34,690
So, what will we do now?

1643
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:35,890
What do you mean?

1644
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:38,280
Master Wong has sold the school to the 
embassy.

1645
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,160
He did what?!

1646
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,270
How could that be?

1647
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,520
Don't you see? They made him sell it.

1648
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,530
He had to or they would kill you both.

1649
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,940
You're just lucky to be alive.

1650
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:51,710
Fei-Hong, this fight is over.

1651
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,840
We can't do this anymore.

1652
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,580
I hope you know your father has 
sacrificed everything.

1653
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:59,450
I wish that they had killed me.

1654
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:02,540
Now, Fei-Hong, that is enough.

1655
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:05,640
Life's changes are like a moving river.

1656
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,470
What's here today is gone tomorrow

1657
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:10,800
and tomorrow brings a whole new journey.

1658
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,970
Let's move forward and live.

1659
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:21,890
So, when will the ship be leaving?

1660
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,100
This Tuesday.

1661
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:25,440
Hmm. And everything's ready?

1662
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:27,570
Yes, sir. Ready and waiting, sir.

1663
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:28,780
Good, good.

1664
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,410
I want to close down the factory, lay 
off the workers,

1665
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,450
and transport the shipment to Hong Kong.

1666
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:34,910
Pick it up.

1667
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:36,730
Yes, sir.

1668
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:44,000
First we work overtime!

1669
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,210
We refuse, then they beat us!

1670
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,170
Chin: And now they think they can fire 
all of us

1671
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:49,450
just like that!

1672
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:52,760
So, are you guys going to let him get 
away with that?

1673
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,580
What do you say, huh?

1674
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,000
Chang Tsan, what's going on?

1675
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:59,250
They closed the mill, and you know what?

1676
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,810
It was English ambassador

1677
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:03,670
who was in charge of doing it.

1678
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:06,010
Sounds like trouble. I don't think I can 
help you.

1679
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,850
Oh, sure. You didn't lose your job.

1680
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:11,020
Well, I'm not gonna let them push us 
around.

1681
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:12,510
Yeah. As soon as they finished the last 
shipment,

1682
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:14,100
they fired all the men.

1683
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:17,150
And you think they have something to do 
with it?

1684
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:19,700
I don't know, but I'm going to find out 
for sure.

1685
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,570
Let me think what it could be.

1686
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,400
We should check the office.

1687
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:26,860
Fei-Hong, could that be it?

1688
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:28,780
Well, we know they're up to something.

1689
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:31,110
- Find a way into the factory. - OK.

1690
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:32,700
Then we'll find a way to stop them.

1691
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,610
Let's go.

1692
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:49,130
Chin: What... What's this?

1693
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,470
My God! Look what they're doing!

1694
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:54,880
Well, we've got to stop them.

1695
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:56,090
I'll tell Fei-Hong.

1696
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:57,100
Hurry, Ho Sang!

1697
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,020
In a hurry?

1698
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,220
Sorry.

1699
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:04,190
Aah!

1700
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:05,890
Let go!

1701
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:08,430
Aah!

1702
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:18,940
Unh!

1703
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:30,580
Chin: Go get help!

1704
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:38,210
Ho Sang, this way!

1705
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:40,040
No. I've got to tell Fei-Hong.

1706
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:44,130
Get out of here!

1707
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,220
Get them!

1708
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,270
Bring Fei-Hong!

1709
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,470
Go now!

1710
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,930
Yaah!

1711
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,570
Yaah!

1712
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,190
Shit!

1713
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:14,750
Madam, they're coming out.

1714
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:17,400
All right, keep it down.

1715
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,960
Then we can organise.

1716
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,950
A good idea. Good day.

1717
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,210
Goodbye. Have a safe trip.

1718
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,760
Take care of the baby.

1719
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,880
I will.

1720
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:28,510
Fei-Hong?

1721
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,540
Yes, Father?

1722
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:31,180
Don't get up. Keep working.

1723
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,510
Are you almost through with that?

1724
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:34,420
Almost finished.

1725
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:36,470
Then start another one.

1726
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,050
I'll make sure he does. It's my 
responsibility.

1727
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,880
He's not allowed to leave. You 
understand me?

1728
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,310
Perfectly.

1729
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:43,730
All right. Good.

1730
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,440
You know, dear,

1731
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,650
I've been thinking about names for the 
baby.

1732
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:51,780
If we were to have a boy, he could be 
Wong Tei-Pau.

1733
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,820
If it's a girl, Wong Pei.

1734
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,390
Nice. Both names are fine.

1735
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:57,610
But do we really need to pick one now?

1736
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:58,610
What if I'm early?

1737
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,030
That shouldn't be a problem

1738
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:01,650
if you take it easy till I get back.

1739
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:02,660
Of course.


1740
01:21:02,740 --> 01:21:04,650
- Fei-Hong? - Yes?

1741
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:05,660
Water the plants.

1742
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,150
I will!

1743
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,460
Hold on! I've got to go.

1744
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,360
Remember, get lots of rest.

1745
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:13,200
We'll be fine. Don't worry.

1746
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,280
Fei-Hong and I will be just fine.

1747
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:16,700
Go! We don't have any time to spare!

1748
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,550
Hurry!

1749
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,670
We've got to get Chin out of there.

1750
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,390
I hope he's still alive.

1751
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:26,880
What can we do?

1752
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:28,930
I'm going to stop them. I'm going to do 
what I can!

1753
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:31,640
I gave my promise to Fu and Chin!

1754
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,010
What do you think?

1755
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,020
Let's go.

1756
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,860
Hey, wait, where are you going?

1757
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:38,850
I'm going to battle!

1758
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:39,970
But...

1759
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,860
Wait, madam, you can't go in your 
condition.

1760
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:45,480
What condition? Come on, I'm only 
pregnant.

1761
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:48,990
Oh, madam, please. Think about the baby.

1762
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,820
What if something were to happen?

1763
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:53,690
You're right. Go ahead without me, then.

1764
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,360
I'll go get my students. Meet me at the 
mill.

1765
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,280
Right. I'll gather up the men.

1766
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:00,450
Oh, thanks, Fei-Hong.

1767
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,990
You're with us, right? Yeah, OK.

1768
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,630
Will you be all right, madam?

1769
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:07,340
- I'll be fine. - Good.

1770
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:08,830
But what if Father finds out?

1771
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,220
Oh, go on. Who cares now what your 
father thinks?

1772
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,710
Only make me proud.

1773
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:14,710
I will. OK.

1774
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,050
- Oh! Fei-Hong! - Yeah?

1775
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,510
Something for good luck.

1776
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,550
I can use it.

1777
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:29,300
We demand justice! We demand 
justice!

1778
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:33,350
We demand justice! We demand justice!

1779
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:37,110
Guards: Get back! Get back!

1780
01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:04,080
You step aside now!

1781
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,470
We demand justice! We know what you have 
in there!

1782
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:07,960
Back off!

1783
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:09,140
Those antiques are not yours,

1784
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:10,100
and we won't let them out of China!

1785
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,670
You have no right to them.

1786
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,890
Is that right?

1787
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:21,150
Charge!

1788
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,180
No! No guns!

1789
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,400
Kill them all!

1790
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:57,720
Fei-Hong, you've got to rescue jade now.

1791
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,670
- Get back! - Stand back!

1792
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:33,540
Unh! Come on!

1793
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,700
- Yaah! - Wait!

1794
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,290
Come on!

1795
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:59,730
One hand!

1796
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,740
Here's water!

1797
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,200
Thanks.

1798
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,920
- No! - Yaah!

1799
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,210
Wait!

1800
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,180
You gotta find jade.

1801
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:39,550
Let's go!

1802
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,310
Yeah. Let's go.

1803
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:45,980
Boss! Boss! Boss!

1804
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:47,890
Boss!

1805
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:49,800
Boss! Boss!

1806
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,360
What happened?

1807
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,180
That drunken guy is here! We got to do 
something!

1808
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,100
All right, get him!

1809
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,160
Won't this be fun.

1810
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,960
Wait!

1811
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:18,340
Do you realise what you're doing?

1812
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:21,000
You're helping them steal our history, 
our culture.

1813
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:24,420
You mean these?

1814
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:26,000
They're of no use to anyone.

1815
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:28,170
If they want to buy them, I'll gladly 
sell.

1816
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:29,250
I won't let you do it.

1817
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:32,300
And what are you gonna do about it?

1818
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:35,560
Listen here, nothing's gonna stand in my 
way,

1819
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,850
so why don't you just go home to Daddy?

1820
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:39,390
I've heard enough.

1821
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,720
Oh? Well, that makes two of us.

1822
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:42,760
Henry?

1823
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:46,190
Don't waste time. Just get it over with.

1824
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,140
Do it.

1825
01:27:48,610 --> 01:27:49,700
You hear me?

1826
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:22,310
Unh!

1827
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:24,310
Sorry.

1828
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:00,300
Ha ha ha! Do something.

1829
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:31,110
Catch! Ha ha ha!

1830
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:40,230
What are you gonna do now? Ha ha 
ha!

1831
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,910
Help him!

1832
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:56,300
Hey!

1833
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:32,320
Drunken boxing, huh?

1834
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:34,780
Well, what do you say?

1835
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:38,920
Come on!

1836
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:02,300
Ooh!

1837
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,470
You OK?

1838
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,100
Aah!

1839
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:54,640
Yaah!

1840
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:05,570
Now it's over!

1841
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,950
Give me another rod!

1842
01:33:20,050 --> 01:33:21,540
What's this?

1843
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:24,410
"A boat can float in water, but also 
sink in it"?

1844
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:26,920
Ahh, a bit of Daddy's wisdom.

1845
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:32,640
Here, finish him off!

1846
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:35,510
All right, this is it!

1847
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,980
Aah!

1848
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,230
Gah!

1849
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,080
Yaah!

1850
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:25,100
Just perfect!

1851
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:28,510
How about it?

1852
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:55,050
Raah!

1853
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:19,790
Hee hee hee!

1854
01:38:27,290 --> 01:38:30,050
Yaah!

1855
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,090
Hmm.

1856
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,560
On behalf of the governor, I want to 
thank Fei-Hong

1857
01:39:00,650 --> 01:39:02,530
for his role in returning the stolen 
antiquities

1858
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:04,690
and on the arrest of the ambassador.

1859
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:05,700
Thank you, sir.

1860
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:06,780
None of this could have happened

1861
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:08,200
without the support of his loving father.

1862
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,690
Ah, well, we need more fathers

1863
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:12,750
who treat their sons like that.

1864
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:16,170
You should be very proud of him.

1865
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:17,420
So, where is he?

1866
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,590
Fei-Hong is still feeling some of the 
after-effects

1867
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:22,380
of all that he's been through.

1868
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,840
We hope he'll soon be on his feet.

1869
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,880
I'm sure that he will come see you as 
soon as he can.

1870
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:29,930
Oh, and he better. I've got a job for 
that boy.

1871
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:32,340
I am certain he will be most pleased.

1872
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:35,460
Smile! Count to 3! 1... 2...

1873
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
