{5202}{5247}- Just hold my hand.|- There we go.|- The l.V. set?
{5250}{5362}- Have you had Lamaze?|- Uh, well, I haven't even|signed up for the course yet.
{5365}{5420}I'm only two months along.
{5422}{5507}- That's the epidural talking.|- She hasn't had an epidural.
{5510}{5607}What are you babbling about?|It's-- It's too soon.
{5610}{5677}- It's too soon, Brian.|- Here he comes.
{5680}{5737}Okay, guys. Calm down.
{5742}{5817}- Take it easy.|Calm down, everybody. Calm down.|- And now a deep breath.
{5820}{5897}It's too early for contractions.
{5900}{5962}- Hold tight. Hold my hand, honey.|Hold my hand.|- All right.
{5965}{6022}- Let's just relax.|- That's right.
{6025}{6087}- Okay. Okay.|- Christ.|- Wait, wait.
{6090}{6142}- Wait, wait.|- You said, "Come back next week." Huh?
{6145}{6190}- Yeah.|- You said it was just fluid retention.
{6192}{6237}"Go home. Have fun."
{6240}{6315}- Yeah, I'm not having fun.|- Yeah, you gotta breathe.
{6320}{6405}Sonogram's fine, Doctor,|for a full-term pregnancy.
{6407}{6470}- Doc, what's going on?|- Okay, it's really important|that you relax and breathe.
{6475}{6517}- She's fully dilated.|- It's gonna be all right.
{6522}{6575}- Now you're gonna push.|- Push, okay? Yes.|- No. It's too soon.
{6577}{6650}- Push hard. Push. Hold it. Hold it.|- Push. Push. Push.

{6802}{6865}- One more. Deep breath.|- And out.|- Push.
{6867}{6945}Push.
{7242}{7307}Look at that.|You've got a baby.
{7345}{7415}It's a beautiful,|beautiful boy.
{7462}{7527}Hey there, bud.
{7555}{7605}Hi.
{7640}{7717}- Don't rust up on me now.|- I'm sorry.
{7820}{7862}We'll call him Jack.
{7865}{7950}What you gonna be|when you grow up
{7952}{8035}What you gonna do|when your time is up
{8037}{8117}What you gonna say|when things go wrong
{8120}{8182}What you gonna do|when it's all over
{8185}{8252}There's a road
{8257}{8342}Long and windin'
{8347}{8402}The lights are blindin'
{8442}{8512}But it gets there
{8517}{8592}Don't give up
{8595}{8677}Don't look back
{8680}{8767}There's a silver linin'
{8770}{8832}It's out there somewhere
{8882}{8962}Everybody wants an answer
{8965}{9045}Everybody needs a friend
{9047}{9122}We all need a shining star
{9125}{9202}On which we can depend
{9207}{9270}So tonight we're gonna wish
{9272}{9312}Upon a star
{9317}{9392}We never wished upon before
{9395}{9450}What you gonna be|when you grow up
{9452}{9537}- To find what you're lookin' for|- What you gonna do when your time is up
{9540}{9610}There'll be times
{9615}{9707}In your life
{9710}{9820}Yeah, when you'll|be dancing and shit
{9822}{9872}But you ain't gettin' it
{9875}{9945}Don't get disillusioned
{9950}{10042}No, don't expect too much
{10045}{10132}'Cause if what you have|is all you can get
{10135}{10222}Just keep on tryin'|It just ain't happened yet
{10225}{10317}Everybody wants to be a winner
{10320}{10400}Everybody has a dream
{10402}{10475}We all need a shining star
{10480}{10557}When things ain't what they seem
{10562}{10665}So tonight we're gonna|wish upon a star
{10670}{10757}We never wished upon before
{10890}{10945}I'm sorry this|has taken so long.
{10947}{11042}Like you, we're puzzled|by your son's premature birth.
{11045}{11172}This is Dr Lin. He's an|infant disorder specialist from Cornell.
{11175}{11292}I want to assure you both that|there is nothing debilitating|about your son's condition.
{11295}{11357}He's totally healthy|and normal in appearance...
{11362}{11415}alert and quite happy.
{11420}{11490}However, his cells are|developing at what we feel...
{11492}{11545}is four times the normal rate.
{11547}{11627}Even though your son was only|ten weeks old when he was born...
{11630}{11737}physically he was nine months|and ready to leave your womb.
{11740}{11830}Nature has given us all|an internal clock.
{11835}{11937}It meters out lifespan,|controls our growth.
{11942}{11997}Your son's internal clock...
{12002}{12087}seems to be ticking|faster than usual.
{12090}{12167}- But he's healthy?|- Absolutely.
{12227}{12325}I'm sorry.|I still don't understand.
{12330}{12380}I've never heard|anything like this before.
{12382}{12450}Well, quite frankly,|neither have we.
{12452}{12520}There are other aging syndromes|that we know of.
{12522}{12592}Progeria, for example, which is|very devastating to the child, but--
{12595}{12682}Jack's cells are replicating|at an unheard of rate.
{12687}{12752}Is he gonna age like this|the rest of his life?
{12757}{12815}Well, sir, this is|only speculation...
{12817}{12910}but, uh, we feel that|at age one...
{12915}{13010}your son may be physically|around age four.
{13015}{13062}And if this continues|throughout his life...
{13065}{13157}by the time he reaches|age ten, well, he could--
{13160}{13245}Appear to be|an ordinary, full-grown...
{13247}{13297}40-year-old man.
{13300}{13365}Are you serious?
{13505}{13572}That's where he lives, right|down the street my whole life...
{13575}{13655}and I didn't even know about it.
{13657}{13732}I don't believe any of it.|He's lying.
{13735}{13827}Yeah. He's not a monster.|There's no such thing.
{13830}{13927}I'm telling you.|He's our age, but he looks 40.
{13930}{14017}All hairy and everything.|He's like a freak or something.
{14020}{14097}Just like in that one movie.
{14102}{14187}- Which movie?|- Duh! The one--
{14190}{14275}- Sorry.|- The one with the freak in it.|What did I just say?
{14280}{14335}Oh. Oh, yeah, l-l saw that one.
{14337}{14410}You didn't see it. His mom wouldn't|let him see it 'cause he has nightmares.
{14412}{14522}- I mean you no harm.|- Why haven't we ever seen him then?
{14525}{14590}I heard he's got|all kinds of toys too.
{14595}{14637}His parents buy him everything.
{14640}{14720}If he's our age,|why ain't he in school?
{14722}{14817}Because he's dangerous.|He's huge enough to hurt other kids.
{14820}{14887}That's why they keep him locked up.
{14890}{14942}Friend.
{14947}{15015}- What do you see?|- Nothing.
{15080}{15145}A teacher comes|to his house every day.
{15307}{15387}Jack, you're not paying attention.
{15390}{15482}- Jack, you're not paying attention.|- Don't be afraid.
{15485}{15532}I saw him in the store|with his mom.
{15535}{15635}I thought it was her husband at first,|but he's like a giant boy.
{15637}{15715}- He shaves and stuff.|- There's no such thing as giants.
{15720}{15785}Well, how'd he get like that?
{15787}{15832}Maybe his mom took drugs.
{15835}{15905}Maybe it was that fertility junk,|and she was gonna have quintuplets...
{15907}{16005}but just turned into|one big baby.
{16007}{16125}- Doof.|- Oh, he sleeps up there.
{16127}{16217}He's a monstrosity.|That's why they hide him.
{16220}{16282}No wonder they keep him|outta school.
{16285}{16332}Maybe they got him chained up.
{16335}{16390}Maybe they only let him loose|once a day to eat.
{16395}{16450}Is that like a big pile|of bones in his backyard?
{16452}{16532}- Where? Uh, what?|l-l don't see anything.|- Look!
{16537}{16577}Look!
{16620}{16670}Look out!
{16697}{16755}Come on, Louis!
{16760}{16807}- We gotta-- We gotta get outta here!|- Oh, gross!
{16810}{16880}Come on, Louis!|He's watching you! Come on!
{16910}{16970}Come on!
{17492}{17560}Ow. Ow.
{17562}{17625}- What happened? What'd you do?|Where does it hurt?|- Ow!
{17630}{17712}- My knee.|- Let me see.
{17760}{17825}Well, it's not bleeding. Okay.
{17827}{17890}- It's not?|- I can fix it for you.|- Okay.
{17895}{17950}- I'll bite it.|- No, no. No, don't bite it.|- Oh, yeah.
{17952}{18002}- I really do. I have to bite it.|- Don't.
{18007}{18052}- Yeah?|- It'll get infected.|- Oh, okay.
{18055}{18122}But this leg has got to come off.|I'll get your father's saw.
{18127}{18190}No, no. No, no, don't get that.
{18242}{18320}I saw-- I saw your butt.
{18322}{18400}- Yeah, you did.|- Sorry.
{18402}{18457}Let's see.
{18535}{18580}- What do you hear?|- Nothing. It's okay.
{18582}{18642}- How about the toes?|- The toes are okay. I can feel that.
{18645}{18682}- Here?|- I can feel that.|- How about that?
{18685}{18745}- That's o-- That's--|- Yeah? That's much better?
{18790}{18837}Oh, go--
{18877}{18917}- Now--|- That feels good now.
{18920}{18972}- I told you about those laces, champ.|- Yeah.
{18977}{19067}- Hmm?|- Yeah.|- Okay.|- You did. Sorry.
{19265}{19322}- So, where were we?|- History.
{19325}{19395}History. Okay.
{19397}{19482}So, by the time he was 18...
{19487}{19600}the young Alexander|had already conquered|most of the Greek city states...
{19602}{19670}and some feel that|he had learned everything...
{19675}{19747}from his tutor, Aristotle.
{19802}{19855}Jack.
{19885}{19952}- Jack.|- Hmm?
{19955}{20015}- What did I just say?|- Aristotle.
{20057}{20112}- Where's Aristotle?|- Book.
{20115}{20212}- Where's Jack?|- Outside.
{20310}{20350}I think what you have|set up here is wonderful.
{20355}{20425}I'm not trying to take|anything away from that.
{20427}{20472}I know you're not.
{20475}{20572}But to say that Jack should start|going to public school is crazy.
{20615}{20692}Yeah, but because|a person is different...
{20695}{20747}you can't make|an outcast of him.
{20750}{20800}But we'll talk to the principal.
{20802}{20855}The principal will prepare|the students.
{20860}{20942}Mr Woodruff,|he's got a 5:00 shadow.
{20945}{21045}I don't think he can fit in.|I wish he could.
{21047}{21092}But nobody said|it would be easy.
{21095}{21222}Jack's developed defence mechanisms just|like any child with a shortcoming does.
{21225}{21282}I appreciate what|you're trying to do...
{21285}{21390}but Brian and l,|we've seen how people react.
{21392}{21437}We've been through this before.
{21442}{21532}I just don't want Jack...
{21535}{21592}to have to face that.
{21645}{21727}Look at his eyes.
{21730}{21780}His child's eyes.
{21837}{21917}Look at his eyes|when he sees other children.
{21990}{22065}His life moves faster than ours,|and he wants to lead a full life...
{22067}{22157}and I don't think you|ought to let it pass him by.
{22160}{22217}It's not fair.
{22497}{22550}- Marco.|- Polo.
{22770}{22825}I've found you now.
{22885}{22930}- Got ya!|- Gotta touch me!
{23052}{23112}Would you two|knock it off up there!
{23115}{23167}"You better knock it off up there!"
{23375}{23432}- Marco.|- Polo.
{23565}{23637}Gotcha! You're it!
{23640}{23725}Oh, honey. Are you okay?
{23727}{23782}Yeah, I'm okay.
{23852}{23942}You know, if something's wrong,|Jackie, you can tell me.
{23945}{24010}Mr Woodruff mentioned|something today.
{24082}{24162}What, honey? Huh?
{24165}{24230}You can tell me.
{24300}{24365}Mom, am I a giant?
{24367}{24430}No, of course not!
{24500}{24602}- Where did you hear that?|- Is that why I don't go to school?
{24605}{24727}Honey, I've told you.|It's lots of things.
{24730}{24787}What things?
{24840}{24887}We'll talk about this, okay?
{24890}{24945}When?
{24950}{25002}-Well, not right now. It's time for bed.|-Time for bed.
{25005}{25060}- Brush your teeth. Put down the lid.|- Brush your teeth. Put down the lid.
{25115}{25175}Good night, Mom.
{25475}{25545}Woodruff doesn't know|what he's talking about.
{25547}{25602}If he doesn't know what|he's talking about, then why|are we paying him all this money...
{25607}{25662}to tutor Jack?
{25665}{25792}I blame him, filling Jack's head|with all these ideas of going to school.
{25795}{25842}Imagine that.
{25845}{25925}A teacher wanting a kid|to go to school, hmm?
{25957}{26025}Where do they get such ideas?
{26027}{26085}That's how we do it?
{26090}{26147}Just throw him into school?
{26150}{26230}- Mm-hmm.|- You know how children are.
{26265}{26320}They make fun of|the fat kid and...
{26322}{26400}the kid who wears glasses.
{26402}{26492}What do you think they're gonna do|to a six-foot, hairy kid?
{26807}{26857}Mom, Dad.
{26860}{26922}Jackie? You okay, honey?
{26927}{26975}- Something wrong?|- Oh, I'm okay.
{26977}{27070}Just can't sleep.|I had a scary dream.
{27072}{27122}Can I sleep in here?
{27127}{27180}Uh, yeah. Of course, buddy.
{27182}{27227}Stimpy too?
{27230}{27280}- Sure.|- Okay.
{27282}{27335}Oh. Hey. Easy.
{27337}{27390}Okay.
{27665}{27725}Hey, come on. Come on.|Come on. Come on.
{27727}{27782}- Jackie. Go to sleep.|- Okay.
{27835}{27885}- Good night, Mom.|- Good night, sweetie.
{27887}{27942}Good night, Dad.
{28197}{28262}You sure he's ready for school?
{28295}{28342}Jackie'll be fine.
{28412}{28497}It's the rest of the world|I'm worried about.
{28940}{29000}Taking a look at traffic|approaching the Bay Bridge, not too bad.
{29002}{29057}The metering lights have been|switched on at the toll plaza.
{29062}{29125}The wait begins right about|the Oakland army base right now.
{29127}{29187}Marin County is under fog,|but the driving's at the speed limit...
{29190}{29255}down and across the Golden Gate Bridge|as you make your way into the city.
{29257}{29292}That's traffic.|Back to you, Rick.
{29295}{29350}Hey, it's Rick the Lip with you|on the "Z" Morning Zoo.
{29355}{29422}Another beautiful one out there|in the city by the bay.
{29427}{29485}And guess what.|We're still here.
{29487}{29542}How about that little wake-up call|that happened this morning at 5:00?
{29547}{29597}- Only 3.2 on the Richter scale,|but I tell you what...|- 3.2!
{29600}{29682}it was a big fat 10|on the scared-the-hell-outta-me scale.
{29687}{29757}- Didn't scare me!|- This man hasn't shaken|so much since I was single.
{29760}{29812}Hey, hey, you got someplace|to be at 7:00?
{29815}{29855}- Yeah, Rick, I gotta be at school!|- You're kidding. You're late.
{29860}{29915}- 7:05.|- I'm late?|- Get yourself outta bed.
{29920}{29957}- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!|- You got a whole day out there|waitin' for ya.
{29962}{30022}- Go! Yeah!|- I'm livin' it. Let's go!|- I'm livin' it, too, Rick!
{30025}{30070}- Let's do it, people.|- I'm gettin' to it, Rick!
{30075}{30117}Misunderstood|Got an--
{30122}{30177}I hate that song.
{30182}{30242}- There you go. Easy.|- Dad, let me do this on my own, okay?
{30245}{30292}- Well, just--|- Watch.|- Okay, okay, okay.
{30295}{30352}But ta-- Take it easy.|Take it easy.
{30355}{30392}- And--|- Okay.|- Okay.|- Okay, okay.
{30395}{30435}- Dad, l-- Dad, Dad.|- Okay. Okay, just--|Okay, hold it. Hold it.
{30440}{30507}- Let me help you. Oh!|- Ow! Dad!
{30510}{30592}- Here. Oops. Put this little Kleenex--|- Okay, put that there.
{30627}{30665}- Ah. Okay.|- Okay. Thank you.
{30667}{30702}Let me just get|that last little part there.
{30707}{30752}- Yeah, just finish up...|- Okay.|- and come on down.
{30755}{30802}- Okay.|- Hurry up.
{31272}{31342}- You psyched?|- Psyched.|- Okay.
{31425}{31507}Oh, wow.|Look at all those kids.
{31510}{31590}- Just remember, you can come|home anytime you want to.|- Uh-huh.
{31595}{31630}- Okay?|- Yeah.|- Okay.
{31632}{31687}I'm okay. Thanks, Dad.
{31862}{31930}Hold it, Jack!
{31932}{32032}Come here. Let me get this.|Okay. Here we go.
{32202}{32280}- Come on.|- I pledge allegiance to the flag...

{63447}{63487}- Oh.|- He just came a couple of weeks ago.
{63490}{63592}- I told him you were coming.|- Oh, well, hello, Mr Powell.
{63597}{63665}My name is Delores,|but my friends call me D.D.
{63667}{63752}So tell me, what happened|to Principal McGee?|I just talked to him on the phone.
{63757}{63857}I don't know what happened|to Mr McGee. Mr Powell?
{63970}{64032}- He got diarrhoea.|- Diarrhoea?
{64035}{64102}Yeah, he got diarrhoea.
{64105}{64147}Uh, and he-- he spewed.
{64150}{64227}Threw up. Yeah, he had--|And, uh, he had the squirts.
{64230}{64297}- He had diarrhoea.|- Oh, boy, that's more|than I needed to know.

{64372}{64485}- He had a bellyache.|- Oh, my God, appendicitis.|Oh, that's too bad.
{64487}{64570}Well, honey, listen. I swiped you|a chocolate mousse from the restaurant.
{64572}{64650}So go sit down and eat it|while I talk to the principal.
{64655}{64765}- No, let me stay, Mom.|- Oh, sweetie, please don't|bust my chops over everything.
{64767}{64865}Go sit down. Oh, God, you see?|That's what I'm talking about.
{64870}{64980}He-- He doesn't listen. I mean, I don't|know whether it's all kids or just him.
{64982}{65032}- Am I right?|- What'd you say?
{65035}{65102}I said kids don't listen.|Am I right?
{65105}{65182}- Don't listen. No.|- Yeah. Well, that's what I thought.
{65185}{65262}Of course, you could say|the same thing about men too.
{65267}{65382}- Probably your wife does all the time.|- Oh, no.
{65387}{65442}- Aren't you married?|- Married?
{65445}{65500}- No, I'm not married.|- I'm divorced, myself.
{65502}{65582}And that's another thing, you know.|Ever since my husband left us...
{65585}{65642}he's got such|a chip on his shoulder.
{65645}{65702}Potato or corn?
{65730}{65775}Anyway, uh, you know.
{65780}{65845}He's-- He's starting|to get interested in girls.
{65847}{65897}I found some dirty magazines|under his bed.
{65902}{65990}Wh-What am I supposed to do about that?|What? l-l don't know what to do.
{65992}{66052}Uh, it's a tough age.
{66055}{66120}I know. I mean,|l-l-l-- I remember.
{66122}{66177}I mean, I re--|I'm remembering now.
{66180}{66272}- It's a tough age.|- Uch!|- Rough, tough age.
{66275}{66335}- Feh.|- Feh.
{66340}{66387}So, tell me, meanwhile,|how is he doin'?
{66390}{66457}'Cause last September|he was failing out miserably.

{66570}{66632}- He's on a roll, really.|- Really?

{66860}{66927}the smartest kid|in the whole school.
{66930}{67005}Yeah. If not, maybe|the smartest kid I've ever met.
{67007}{67102}Oh, my God! I can't believe|I'm finally getting a good report.
{67107}{67162}It makes me so happy.
{67165}{67240}I mean, I can't believe|you're telling me this.
{67242}{67305}'Cause you know, this means|that maybe he's happy...
{67310}{67410}and I made the right decision|about moving us out here.
{67440}{67480}Listen, you know...
{67482}{67532}if you want to have|lunch or something...
{67535}{67662}we can talk about Louie and, you know,|just kind of shoot the breeze.
{67667}{67752}- What do you think?|- Don't.|- Oh.

{68620}{68705}And I'm gonna give Mr Powell|my number at work...
{68707}{68805}so that you can call me|and let me know how he's doing.
{68807}{68865}Can stay on top of things.

{99625}{99707}You're a very|nice young man, yes.

{99892}{99952}that you might want|to go to the dance with me.
{99985}{100047}It'd be really, really fun.

{103527}{103595}Well, not exactly.
{103597}{103720}This is a form|of arteriosclerosis or angina.

{117180}{117272}- Kid.|- They haven't seen her since, I guess.
{117317}{117377}Bet you could crack walnuts|on her ass too.
{117640}{117717}- Hey, go for it, big Jack.|- Hi, boys.|- Hi, D.D.
{117857}{117922}Oh!
{117925}{118007}Principal Powell!
{118010}{118095}I'm so surprised|to see you here.
{118097}{118202}Oh, what a nice surprise.|I can't believe it!
{118205}{118292}Nice to see you.|It's nice to see someone I know.
{118295}{118435}Oh, well, that's a nice thing to say.|How're you doing?
{118437}{118510}- I can't believe you're here.|- Me too.
{118512}{118617}Believe me, that wasn't|the first matchbook I ever passed out.
{118687}{118820}Mmm. Ooh. That looks like fun.|Wanna go dance?
{118822}{118867}Okay.
{118912}{118967}Oh.
{118970}{119062}Mmm. So gallant.|You man, you.
{119065}{119140}Shoo-doo, shoo-be-doo

{119232}{119300}Shoo-doo, shoo-be-doo
{119305}{119367}Shoo-doo, shoo-be-whoa
{119370}{119500}In the still of the night
{119500}{119547}- I like you.|- I held you
{119550}{119640}- You're so different|from a lot of the men I know.|- Held you tight
{119645}{119712}And do you know|who else likes you?
{119717}{119832}My Louie. He's a great|judge of character.
{119835}{119887}I don't know where|he gets it from.
{119940}{120035}Because, of course, he hates|everybody that I usually go for.
{120057}{120117}I like a burly guy.
{120120}{120192}Uh-oh, honey.
{120195}{120245}Mmm.
{120247}{120322}I got a good feeling|about you, mister.
{120327}{120452}The stars were bright above|I remember
{120477}{120552}I'll hope
{120557}{120655}And I'll pray
{120657}{120762}To keep your precious love
{120765}{120840}- What's the matter?|- I gotta go.|- Why?
{120845}{120900}Why?
{120905}{121015}-Your Louie's mom. I gotta go.|-That's what makes it so perfect, honey.
{121017}{121095}I'm Louie's mom,|and you're Louie's principal.
{121097}{121147}In the still of the night
{121212}{121275}- Hey, watch it!|- Hey! Hey! Watch it!|- Whoa! You!
{121277}{121332}That's the second time tonight.|What, are you stupid?
{121392}{121420}- All right, all right.|- Whoa, whoa!|- Leave him alone!
{121422}{121480}Where are you goin', man?|I want an apology!
{121482}{121560}- I'm sorry.|- No, no, no. That's not|going to be good enough.
{121562}{121635}- "Sorry."|- Well, I said I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
{121637}{121700}Jeez, what is it with you?|What? Are you totally hyper|or something? Too much sugar?
{121702}{121737}What? Do you think|you're pretty smart?
{121740}{121787}Yeah, I do good in everything|except social studies.
{121790}{121867}Studies? How'd you like|to study my fist?
{121872}{121932}Hey, hey, hey!|Leave him alone, asshole!
{121935}{121987}- Come on, Mr Powell.|Let's just get out of--|- What's the matter, man?
{121990}{122060}- You gotta let your girlfriend|here stand up for you?|- Come on. Just let's go.
{122062}{122092}- You know what your problem is, mister?|- Ignore him.
{122097}{122172}- You got the "Zackly" disease.|- What's that?
{122175}{122242}That's where you mouth smells|"zackly" Iike your butt!
{122245}{122297}Where'd you get that from?|Louis? He always says that.
{122300}{122360}- Come on. Let's just go.|- And you're a loser!|- Oh, yeah?
{122362}{122430}- Losers say "what."|- What?|- Loser!
{122432}{122490}- Rubber, glue, sticks to you! Got him!|- What are you doing?
{122492}{122540}This guy's very tough!|Stop with this! Let's go!
{122542}{122632}- I'm a loser, but|you're a son of a bitch!|- I can't believe you said that!
{122637}{122707}You cussed!|Oh, you said the "B" word!
{122710}{122792}Oh, you're gonna get in|so much trouble! You really are!
{122795}{122837}Trouble?
{122877}{122920}- Here's some trouble!|- Come on, Principal Powell!
{122977}{123027}Oh, my God!|Are you okay?
{123030}{123090}Hey, you all right?
{123092}{123137}You okay?
{123205}{123262}- Paulie!|- Huh?|- Paulie!
{123265}{123352}Oh, don't worry about it.|Happens all the time.
{123427}{123502}Mr Powell, put your feet|on the marks on the floor.
{123505}{123612}Now look up at the camera.|Hold the plaque chin high.
{123650}{123700}Now turn to your right.
{123810}{123877}Jack Powell.
{123880}{123932}Your bail's posted, pal.
{124000}{124045}Come on.
{124272}{124372}Let's get your stuff here|and you can go.
{124375}{124425}You've got a library card...
{124430}{124462}a pocket knife...
{124465}{124542}Spider-Man watch,|Pez dispenser.
{124545}{124592}Where's my Pog?
{124595}{124662}It was the slammer.
{124770}{124822}Is my mom here?
{124825}{124910}Oh! Oh, Mr Powell!|Are you okay?
{124945}{125002}Hey, buddy boy.|Hey, kid!
{125005}{125097}They were pretty shocked to hear|they arrested the principal,|but they let you go.
{125465}{125575}- Sorry about tonight.|- Oh, that's okay.
{125640}{125705}Mmm, boy.
{125707}{125800}You've got eyes|just like Louis.
{125802}{125850}So young-looking.
{125877}{125937}You know, that's|the strangest thing.
{125972}{126027}What kind|of eye cream do you use...
{126030}{126112}and can I have about a quart?
{126160}{126255}Well, it's been a long night.
{126257}{126332}I'm going to let you|out of my chariot.
{126335}{126412}- Gotta be going.|- Thanks for taking me home.
{126690}{126745}Good night, Mr Powell.
{128290}{128335}- Hey, Mr Woodruff.|- Hey, kid.|- Hi!
{128340}{128402}- Hi, Mr Woodruff.|- How ya doin', fellas?
{128467}{128570}- How's the tree house comin'?|- Looks like my room.|You know what that looks like.
{128572}{128652}We're just hangin',|tryin' to catch Jack.
{128655}{128727}Jack's still a little tired,|boys, and he's sleeping.
{128730}{128850}- I'll tell him you came by.|- Give me some skin, boys.
{128852}{128907}I'll take this up|to Jack for you.
{128910}{128992}Bye, Mr Woodruff.|Bye, Mrs Powell.
{129020}{129075}Thank you for coming.
{129115}{129172}He's been in his room|for two-and-a-half weeks.
{129177}{129235}Maybe you could|talk to him.
{129237}{129282}He's very confused.
{129285}{129402}I think he's realized|how fragile his life is.
{129405}{129480}You know,|maybe I'm not the answer.
{129485}{129580}- Maybe he needs|to go back to school--|- He can't go back to school.
{129582}{129632}That's what started this|in the first place.
{129637}{129717}We can't risk|his health again.
{129720}{129815}Jack, Mr. Woodruff's here|to see you.
{129880}{129937}Here, give me this.|Thank you.
{129995}{130040}Jack, honey.
{130045}{130112}Mr Woodruff's here to see you.
{130615}{130705}So why don't you want me|to teach you any more?
{130740}{130850}Why do I have to learn stuff|I'm never gonna use?
{130852}{130892}That isn't why|I'm teaching you, Jack.
{130895}{130977}I'm teaching you so you'll learn|something new, interesting.
{130980}{131035}That's all.
{131037}{131082}I don't care any more.
{131290}{131377}- Is he sick?|- No, I don't think so.
{131380}{131447}- Then what's wrong with him?|- Yeah, what's wrong with him?
{131452}{131525}- He's aging.|- Is he coming back?
{131565}{131645}- I wish he'd come back.|- So do l.
{131650}{131752}- Yeah, so do l.|- Hey, we all do.|- Yeah.
{132032}{132082}What are you doing?
{132085}{132187}- Going home.|- You be back tomorrow?
{132192}{132265}- This is yours.|- You can't quit.
{132270}{132322}I don't consider|myself quitting.
{132327}{132425}I consider myself|losing a student.
{132427}{132505}You know why I like|to teach children, Jack?
{132507}{132602}So I don't get so wrapped up|in being an adult.
{132605}{132707}So I can remember|that there are other things...
{132710}{132792}that are important in life.
{132797}{132855}Like riding a bike...
{132857}{132987}playing in a tree house,|splashing water with good shoes on.
{133102}{133222}And you, my friend,|were my most special student.
{133225}{133352}And, until recently, you were|everything I ever wanted in a student.
{133355}{133475}You were a shooting star|amongst ordinary stars.
{133480}{133522}Have you even seen|a shooting star, Jack?
{133550}{133597}- No.|- Oh, it's--
{133600}{133670}It's wonderful.|It passes quickly...
{133672}{133752}but while it's here,|it just lights up the whole sky.
{133757}{133832}It's the most beautiful thing|you'd ever want to see.
{133835}{133920}So beautiful|that the other stars...
{133922}{133962}stop...
{133965}{134012}and watch.
{134095}{134182}- You almost never see one.|- Why?
{134185}{134252}Because they're very rare,|quite rare.
{134277}{134322}But I saw one.
{134375}{134420}I did.
{134575}{134642}I just want to be|a regular star.
{134722}{134842}Jack, you'll never|be regular.
{134845}{134917}You're spectacular.
{135110}{135167}Mr Woodruff?
{135977}{136032}Eureka.
{136127}{136182}Yo, Mrs Powell!
{136187}{136222}Hey, Mrs Powell!
{136262}{136302}Hey, Jack's mother!
{136305}{136372}Jack's mother!
{136375}{136420}Mrs Powell!
{136677}{136752}Hey, can Jack|come out and play?
{136755}{136807}I'm sorry, Louis.|He can't.
{136810}{136892}But why don't you try again|in a couple of days?
{136990}{137062}Hey, Jack's mother?
{137090}{137160}- Mrs Powell?|- Mrs Powell!
{137240}{137305}Can Jack come out and play?
{137355}{137402}He doesn't want to.
{137757}{137825}Hey, Jack's mother!
{137830}{137912}Jack's mother!
{137915}{137975}Hey, Jack's mother!
{137980}{138042}Can Jack come out and play?
{138047}{138105}Girls, I'm sorry.|He doesn't want to.
{138110}{138172}Can we at least see him|so we'll know that he's alive?
{138365}{138422}- I told you!|- No, I told you!|- I told you.
{138425}{138482}I said she wasn't|gonna let us see him--
{138485}{138532}- No!|- And you said, "Yes, she is. Let's go!"
{138535}{138580}And I said,|"No, he feels too bad."
{138585}{138630}That's not true!
{138632}{138710}- And you said--|- I told you--|- Of course, as always, you say--
{138712}{138762}I said that--
{138840}{138907}- Hey, Jack's mother!|- I know. I know.
{138912}{139000}- Can Jack come out and play?|- Yeah, can he come out and play?
{139002}{139072}- You are not going to go away, are you?|- Hey, Jack's mother!
{139077}{139182}- I know what you're doing.|- Yo, Jack! Come on out, man!
{139185}{139257}- Yeah, come on out!|- Kids, I'm sorry.
{139260}{139355}I know he misses you, but|he just doesn't want to come out today.
{139357}{139465}- Hey, guys.|- Try again some other time.|- What's up, Victor?
{139470}{139517}Mario, Eric!
{139567}{139627}Hurry up. Come on!
{139630}{139705}Hey, Jack! Come out and play!
{139792}{139857}Come on, Jack!|Come on out right now! Come on!
{139860}{139922}Why won't you come out|and play with us?
{139960}{140027}Come on, Jack.|Just like old times! Come on, Jack!
{140032}{140110}- We're all here to see you!|- I miss you at the court, Jack!
{140342}{140402}Shoo! Go away!
{140617}{140675}Go on!
{140792}{140862}Can Jack come out to play?
{142590}{142655}Mom, Dad.
{142660}{142715}I'm going to school.
{142812}{142895}Mom, please say it's okay.
{142940}{143032}Well, you better hurry up.|You don't want to be late.
{143100}{143167}- Thanks.|- Wait.
{143170}{143215}- Uh--|- A peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
{143217}{143292}- Okay.|- Uh, Principal McGee, please.|- Gotta turn in my assignment.
{143297}{143375}"When I grow up, I want|to put on about 250 pounds...
{143377}{143470}and be a rapper like Heavy D,|except Heavy E.
{143475}{143520}I want to go to China and, uh...
{143522}{143585}film a music video|called 'Chubby.'
{143727}{143790}Then, I might wanna be|a part-time boxer...
{143792}{143877}or maybe a kickboxer|so I can kick some butt."
{143880}{143917}Louis.
{144025}{144132}"I want to be just like|my best friend when I grow up.
{144135}{144210}He's only 10,|but he looks much older.
{144255}{144347}He's like the perfect grown-up,|because on the inside...
{144350}{144417}he's still just a kid.
{144420}{144562}He's not afraid to learn things|or try things...
{144565}{144650}or to meet new people|the way most grown-ups are.
{144652}{144735}It's like he's looking at|everything for the first time...
{144740}{144787}because he is.
{144790}{144867}And most grown-ups|aren't like that.
{144870}{144977}Most grown-ups just want|to go to work and make money...
{144980}{145037}and show off|for the neighbours.
{145040}{145145}And more than anything,|he knows how to be a great friend...
{145147}{145212}- more than most people|who look like adults."|- It's Jack.
{145215}{145277}- Jack's here!|- It's Jack!
{145305}{145392}Jack! It's so good|to have you back.
{145395}{145447}- Sorry I'm late.|- That's okay.
{145450}{145550}- Hi, Jack.|- Hi, Louie.|- Your seat's waiting for you.
{145552}{145602}- We were just in the middle|of Louis' essay.|- Hey, Jack.
{145605}{145672}- Welcome back.|- Hey, buddy.
{145900}{145957}Louis, you may continue.
{145982}{146027}"More than anything...
{146030}{146097}he knows how to be|a great friend...
{146100}{146190}more than most people|who look like adults.
{146195}{146272}So I may not know what|I want to be when I grow up...
{146275}{146342}and right now|I really don't care...
{146345}{146397}but I do know|who I want to be like.
{146437}{146502}I want to be like the giant...
{146530}{146580}the big guy...
{146582}{146657}my best friend...
{146660}{146722}Jack."
{146762}{146812}Thank you.
{146902}{146960}Good job, Louis.
{146962}{147007}Very good, Louis.
{147010}{147075}That was wonderful, Louis.
{147132}{147192}Yeah, Louis.|That was wonderful.
{147240}{147322}Okay, class.|Let's begin our lesson today.
{147405}{147457}Turn to page 173.

{148760}{148827}- Please yourself.|- Okay, I will.|- Do that.
{148955}{148995}I'll take her out, Brian.
{148997}{149030}Oh!
{150017}{150077}Ladies and gentlemen,|it is my honour to introduce...
{150080}{150192}this year's valedictorian,|Jack Charles Powell.
{150792}{150852}Thank you, Aristotle.
{150955}{150985}Sorry.
{151230}{151290}Yo, Jack! Go get 'em!
{151330}{151377}I got it, Eric.
{151382}{151452}I'm cool.
{151455}{151490}My speech.
{151545}{151602}I don't have|very much time these days...
{151605}{151690}so I'll make it quick,|like my life.
{151787}{151895}You know, as we come to the end|of this phase of our life...
{151900}{152022}we find ourselves trying|to remember the good times...
{152025}{152107}and trying to forget|the bad times.
{152110}{152202}We find ourselves|thinking about the future...
{152207}{152332}and start to worry, thinking,|"What am I gonna do?
