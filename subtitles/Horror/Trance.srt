1
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,376
19 million, it's against you, sir.
20 million pounds.

2
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,920
20. Here's the bid at 20 million.

3
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,048
21 million. Back in the aisle.

4
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,551
<i>There is a painting, it's by Rembrandt.</i>

5
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>'Storm On The Sea Of Galilee', it's called...</i>

6
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,223
<i>...and he's in it.</i>

7
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,435
<i>Old Rembrandt, he's in the painting.</i>

8
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,564
<i>He's in there, right in the middle of
the storm, looking straight out at you.</i>

9
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>But...you can't see him.</i>

10
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,862
<i>And the reason you can't see him
is because the painting has been stolen.</i>

11
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,740
<i>Lots of paintings have been stolen.
They're still missing.</i>

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,743
'Pride Of Lions' showing here on my left.
Thank you.

13
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,079
I start the bidding here
at a thousand guineas.

14
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,624
<i>It used to be anyone could steal a painting.</i>

15
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,043
<i>There was no need for a gun.</i>

16
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,047
<i>All it took was a bit of muscle
and some nerve.</i>

17
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,132
<i>And that...</i>

18
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,636
<i>...was that.</i>

19
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,642
<i>But not anymore. Those days are gone.</i>

20
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:45,438
<i>A business can't function taking big hits
like that. So now we have procedures...</i>

21
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,941
<i>...and precautions and security measures.</i>

22
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>Now we have a policy.</i>

23
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:56,157
<i>We have bag searches and magnetic alarms
and silent scanners...</i>

24
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,576
<i>...and X-ray machines and cameras.</i>

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>Also we have drills.
And the first thing they tell us is...</i>

26
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,916
Do not be a hero.

27
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,962
This is a robbery!

28
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,467
Now no piece of art is worth a human life.

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,140
<i>It's a sound piece of advice, that.
No piece of art is worth a human life.</i>

30
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,185
<i>But...</i>

31
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,479
<i>...in the event of an event...</i>

32
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,442
<i>...or situation we are to remove
the most valuable item...</i>

33
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,319
<i>...or items and take them
to a place of safety.</i>

34
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,948
<i>I.E., the fast-drop slot...</i>

35
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,325
<i>...in a time delay vault.</i>

36
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,661
That's about all you can do really.

37
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,831
Come and enjoy the auction.

38
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,835
<i>I mean, if you wanna let people in,
if you want them to bid...</i>

39
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:53,006
<i>And when you're trying to flog the star
of the show for 25 million sterling...</i>

40
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,800
<i>...you definitely want them to bid.</i>

41
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,179
Â£650,000.

42
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,683
Sold to paddle 88.
Congratulations, madam.

43
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,810
Ladies and gentlemen...

44
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,355
...there will now be a brief interval.

45
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,984
When we reconvene,
our head auctioneer, Francis Lemaitre...

46
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:17,030
...will lead the auction
for Goya's 'Witches In The Air'.

47
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,698
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,704
<i>So we notify the cops
about big ticket sales...</i>

49
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,708
<i>...and we even keep half a dozen
Ukrainian ex-naval commandos...</i>

50
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:33,004
<i>...in a van outside,
just in case it all kicks off. Or so they say.</i>

51
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,883
Simon, are you coming? I'm about to start.

52
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,012
Yeah.

53
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,223
Here we go.

54
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,187
<i>So, what happens, of course, is that
just as we up our game, the villains up theirs.</i>

55
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,234
<i>They don't just turn up on spec anymore.
We have precautions, they have plans.</i>

56
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,863
<i>They do research, they do recces.
They learn about our cameras and scanners...</i>

57
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:03,243
<i>...and Ukrainian ex-naval commandos
but some things don't change.</i>

58
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,705
It still takes muscle and it still takes nerve.

59
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,917
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to Delancy's.

60
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:16,798
We are extremely honored to be selling
Francisco de Goya's wonderful work...

61
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,758
...of 'Witches In The Air'.

62
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,136
Goya, the father of modern art...

63
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,097
...and the first great painter
of the human mind.

64
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:28,268
Let's start the bidding at 5 million pounds.

65
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,603
Thank you, sir. 5 million pounds.
An opening bid.

66
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,773
5 million, 500 thousand. 6 million.

67
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,614
In the center here at 10 million pounds.

68
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,075
11 million on the aisle.

69
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,786
12 million. 13 million.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,627
17 million. Thank you, sir. 18 million.

71
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,758
19 million. Bad luck. 20?

72
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,097
21 million pounds. Take your time.

73
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,599
22 million. Thank you.

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,914
Telephone bidder now.
26 million. 26 on the telephone.

75
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,166
27 to the lady on the aisle.

76
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,626
-Small one?
-Small one.

77
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,087
27 million, 500 thousand I'll take.

78
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,591
Last chance. Hammer's coming down.

79
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,345
I'm selling for 27 million,
500 thousand pounds.

80
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,931
Sold. Paddle number 104.

81
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,851
Get down! Get down!

82
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,315
Gas. Gas!

83
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,527
Everybody out now!

84
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,699
Everybody get out the building now!
Come on!

85
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,709
Gas attack.

86
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,211
<i>Gas attack, gas attack.</i>

87
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,404
<i>Attention please. Attention please.</i>

88
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,407
<i>Please evacuate the building.</i>

89
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,076
<i>Please do not use the elevators.</i>

90
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,372
<i>Make your way
to the nearest emergency exit.</i>

91
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,502
<i>So when it happens, as one day it must...</i>

92
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,880
...it is imperative not to panic.

93
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,924
<i>Follow the drill and let the training kick in.</i>

94
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,427
<i>If circumstances allow...</i>

95
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,096
...if, remember only if...

96
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,391
<i>...in the event of an event...</i>

97
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,560
<i>...or situation...</i>

98
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,230
<i>...we are to remove, where possible,
the most valuable item or items...</i>

99
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,441
<i>...and take them to a place of safety.</i>

100
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,276
Stop right there.

101
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,447
Step back.

102
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,785
Remember, do not be a hero.

103
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,536
Put it down.

104
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,459
No piece of art is worth a human life.

105
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,893
No, no, no...

106
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,021
Don't.

107
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,116
Fucking idiot!

108
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,076
Riz, let's go.

109
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,056
Afternoon, Sister.

110
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,517
And how are you feeling?

111
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,686
Fine.

112
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,147
Been up?

113
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,901
-Walking?
-Yeah. Walking and everything.

114
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,736
You know who you are?

115
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,239
Yeah, I think so.

116
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,200
How do you feel about going home?

117
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,205
Jolly good! Right, come on, troops, let's go.

118
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:00,804
Thanks.

119
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,072
Oh, fuck off!

120
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,741
Fuck's sake.

121
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,698
Hello?

122
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,451
<i>Hey, Simon. Franck wants to see you.</i>

123
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,346
Where is it?

124
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,641
I don't know. I'm sorry, Franck.

125
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,978
You must have taken it.
You must have put it somewhere.

126
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,648
-Yeah, I must have. I know I...
-Well, did you or did you not?

127
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,651
I can't remember! I got hit on the head!

128
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,320
That you remember?

129
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:44,407
Yeah, I got a big fucking scar
on my head to remind me, don't I?

130
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,576
What did you expect?

131
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:50,830
You assaulted me. I had a shotgun.
Simon, the plan was simple.

132
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,751
All you needed to do was take the painting
and bring it to me.

133
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,503
I know, I...

134
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,214
So, where is it?

135
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,093
I don't know, I can't remember.
I can't remember.

136
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,679
I'm sorry, I can't remember.

137
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,846
Franck!

138
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:10,600
Amnesia's bollocks.
Everyone knows amnesia is bollocks.

139
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,394
No, it's not.

140
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,707
It's not going to work.

141
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,044
-What do you mean?
-He cannot remember.

142
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,380
How did you work that out?

143
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,843
Look at him. Any man who knew
would have told you by now.

144
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:51,850
Hey.

145
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,188
You know what?

146
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,692
I ought to kill you.

147
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,736
Why don't you?

148
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:07,032
Finish the job and put me out of my misery.

149
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,075
And then...

150
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,412
...you can find your own fucking painting.

151
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,043
Riz.

152
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,254
Give him some food.

153
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:27,302
<i>Well, his brain is intact on a gross level.
On a smaller scale, who's to say?</i>

154
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,138
What I'm saying is we don't know.
The memories may come back, they may not.

155
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,098
All you can do is wait and see.

156
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:36,102
-Isn't there something you can do?
-For memory? Nothing. Except time.

157
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,063
Some sort of medicine?

158
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:43,443
-There's no drug therapy for amnesia.
-What about other sorts of therapy?

159
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,237
Here.

160
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,198
Pick one.

161
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,872
Hypnosis?

162
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,209
He said it might work.

163
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:04,089
What am I gonna tell him?
I stole a painting and now I've lost it?

164
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,425
-You know, you make something up.
-What if that doesn't work?

165
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,302
Doesn't work?

166
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,096
Simon...

167
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,015
Doesn't work?!

168
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,060
Okay, okay.

169
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,405
That one.

170
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,075
-Why her?
-I don't know. I like the name.

171
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,161
Right.

172
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,836
You walk across a wide open space.

173
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,173
Exactly the sort of place
which might once have made you panic.

174
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:52,012
You are in Cape Canaveral
and you are Head of Mission Control.

175
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,849
The rocket is ready to launch
and although you are excited...

176
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,727
...you will not prematurely
release the rocket.

177
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,272
And now you watch as the spider
leaves its web...

178
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,734
...and crawls slowly across the floor
towards you.

179
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,738
There is 30,000 feet of air
between you and the ground...

180
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,033
...and the sound of those
perfectly functioning jet engines...

181
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:16,244
...is making you feel calm
because you know...

182
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,371
...that you are not hungry...

183
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:23,209
...and that these are feelings
of stress and loneliness...

184
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:28,465
...and that you will see the ball cross
the green and disappear into the hole.

185
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:44,481
Okay, my name is not Simon Newton.
My name is David Maxwell.

186
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,275
I cannot find my car keys.

187
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,278
Please stop doing that.
Stop hitting it. Say your name.

188
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,446
Okay.

189
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,698
-My name is David Maxwell.
-Yeah, set.

190
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,077
Seriously, what if I say too much?

191
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,870
We wake you up.

192
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,769
<i>Mr. Maxwell?</i>

193
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,980
<i>Mr. Maxwell?</i>

194
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,778
<i>-Mr. Maxwell?
-That's me. I'm sorry.</i>

195
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,284
Something the matter?

196
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,994
Of course not.

197
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,289
-I'm Elizabeth Lamb.
-I'm... Mr. Maxwell.

198
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,541
Please.

199
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,625
Okay.

200
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,674
<i>You've come to find your car keys?</i>

201
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,842
<i>Yep.</i>

202
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,593
<i>They're just in here.</i>

203
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,140
-I wish.
-Hang up your coat.

204
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,641
Have a seat.

205
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,815
Have you ever been hypnotized before?

206
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,317
No. Um...

207
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:17,240
No. No, at least not that I can remember.

208
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:22,162
I suppose you've spent some time trying
to remember where you put these keys?

209
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,623
I've tried everything.
I just keep coming up against a brick wall.

210
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,959
Of course. So...

211
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,755
...I don't want you to do the work today.

212
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,675
I want you... to sit back.

213
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,850
And I want you to close your eyes.

214
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,186
We're starting, right.

215
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,314
I want you to think about someone else.

216
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,275
Someone who could do it for you.

217
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,152
<i>Another man.</i>

218
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,197
<i>Like you but not you.</i>

219
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,618
I want you to focus on him.
Let him take over.

220
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,829
<i>Is he there?</i>

221
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,041
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Is he under already?

222
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,043
<i>Do you wanna give him a name?</i>

223
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,461
Simon.

224
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,004
<i>Simon Newton.</i>

225
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,131
-Get him out of there.
-No, no.

226
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,885
<i>Right, Simon. Welcome to the session.</i>

227
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,555
Thanks. It's really nice to be here.

228
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,353
Now I want you to relax, Simon.

229
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,564
I like your voice.

230
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,069
And now your mind is starting to think.

231
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,825
So think about those keys.
And you now can feel them in your hand.

232
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:46,413
The shape. The metal.

233
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,082
And you can see the color.

234
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,167
Blue.

235
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,921
They are on a blue key-ring.

236
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:59,551
And your mind starts to think about
the last time you remember them.

237
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,055
<i>I'm trying to walk...</i>

238
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,518
<i>...and they're in my pocket.</i>

239
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,271
<i>And I want you to picture them
in your pocket...</i>

240
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:15,400
<i>...exactly as they were
before you lifted them out...</i>

241
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,278
...and you placed them somewhere.

242
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,572
A safe place...

243
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:25,785
<i>...that, when the time is right, you will be able
to reach for them and they will be there.</i>

244
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,872
Where did you say they were?

245
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,751
In the wardrobe.

246
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,384
<i>What's in the wardrobe, Simon?</i>

247
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,636
The...

248
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,227
I'm sorry about that.

249
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,229
Was I hypnotized?

250
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,609
No, you were just finding your car keys.

251
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,077
Let me fucking get in through there.

252
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:19,756
Really sorry. I kept thinking about the painting.
She just kept saying "keys".

253
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,175
Well, that's it, then, it can't be done.

254
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:26,012
She got his name in 30 seconds.

255
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,264
And she found the car keys.

256
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,684
Whatever is in his head, she can find.

257
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,936
What am I supposed to say,
that I lost my keys again?

258
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,691
You're the clever boy. You got us into this
so now you think of something to get us out.

259
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,319
And you make it work.

260
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,399
Hey! Fucking pedestrians!

261
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,571
St. Pancras please.

262
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,776
You must think I'm stalking you.

263
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,113
No, I just think you've put yourself
under a lot of pressure.

264
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:13,870
To be honest, I'm not here to look
for my keys. I found them, thank you.

265
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,581
I'm looking for something a bit more...

266
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,918
...personal. And...

267
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,128
...I can't tell you what it is.

268
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,798
It's not porn. I promise.

269
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:27,926
<i>And I just really need to find this thing.</i>

270
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:32,222
<i>Hypnosis is the perfect tool.
I don't need to know what it is.</i>

271
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:42,982
<i>So I'd like you to close your eyes
and imagine you're in an elevator.</i>

272
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,737
<i>A wide elevator with velvet walls
and thick carpets.</i>

273
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,115
<i>And as the doors close...</i>

274
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,784
<i>...your eyelids become heavier.</i>

275
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:58,164
<i>And as your eyes become heavier
and the elevator begins to go down...</i>

276
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:02,669
<i>...you realize that this is the elevator
of relaxation.</i>

277
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:08,508
<i>And now you're on the third floor
going down...</i>

278
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:12,178
<i>...and you could get out
but you want to go on...</i>

279
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,305
<i>...deeper.</i>

280
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,182
<i>Deeper.</i>

281
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,519
<i>Deeper into relaxation.</i>

282
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:25,483
<i>And you feel that perhaps
you'll never want to get out.</i>

283
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,777
<i>It's so safe here.</i>

284
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,320
<i>So comfortable.</i>

285
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,032
<i>So relaxed.</i>

286
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:36,661
I don't wanna talk to Simon anymore.

287
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:41,041
I wanna talk to the men who are listening.
The men who hurt him.

288
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,751
Oh, fuck.

289
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,908
<i>You feel safe?</i>

290
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:19,204
<i>-Safe?
-Yes.</i>

291
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,833
<i>I don't think you'll hurt me.</i>

292
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,711
<i>You're right. Absolutely.</i>

293
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:31,508
<i>It would be irrational.
And yet we are like that, aren't we?</i>

294
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:35,512
<i>All of us sometimes stupid. Irrational.</i>

295
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,808
<i>It's fear, I think. Fear of the unknown.</i>

296
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,271
<i>There are four of us
but we are frightened of you.</i>

297
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,983
You don't need to be.

298
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,611
I'm so glad to hear that.

299
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,616
Simon is an unusual subject.

300
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:00,704
He floats in and out of trance very easily.

301
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,122
But...

302
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,874
...he's got a lot on his mind.

303
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,877
Fear. Resentment. Anger.

304
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,423
Why do you think he did it?

305
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,510
-Greed, most likely.
-Does he strike you as greedy?

306
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,138
Everyone is--sooner or later.

307
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:22,058
Simon wanted the painting, that's it.

308
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,727
For himself?

309
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:26,730
Well, it's not like he did it for someone else.

310
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,481
Quite sure of that, are you?

311
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,817
Please don't.

312
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,905
So, can you do it?

313
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,408
Hypnotherapy will work.

314
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:39,617
But?

315
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:44,080
Only if it's a partnership.

316
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,957
Very well.

317
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,626
The finder's fee is 3%.

318
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,378
It's not enough.

319
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:52,839
See what I mean?

320
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:58,219
It's not about the money.
I have to have equal status in the group...

321
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,722
...otherwise Simon won't respect me.

322
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,353
If you wanna make progress...

323
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:10,857
...you really have to move beyond
getting one over on people, Franck.

324
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:20,575
Hypnotherapy is a means of altering
unwanted or dysfunctional behavior.

325
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,661
The unwanted behavior in Simon's case
is forgetting.

326
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:27,707
-You mean he's doing it deliberately?
-Not in the sense that you mean, Dominic.

327
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:31,419
We keep secrets from lots of people, but
most of all we keep them from ourselves.

328
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,880
And we call that forgetting.

329
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:39,427
Now, Simon...

330
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:43,723
...I'd like you to close your eyes.

331
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,062
Okay, okay.

332
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:53,650
I'd like you to think about being at home.

333
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:58,029
Home is a place where you feel secure.

334
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:00,657
In control.

335
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:06,579
You are feeling refreshed and positive.

336
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,877
<i>And when the doorbell rings...</i>

337
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,880
<i>...you feel a rush of enthusiasm.</i>

338
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:18,883
-Hello?<i>
-Parcel for Simon Newton, please.</i>

339
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,095
Er... coming.

340
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:29,728
<i>Hey, Mr. Postman. Thank you very much.</i>

341
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,522
<i>You are excited...</i>

342
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,277
<i>...but you stay calm...</i>

343
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,781
<i>...because you know that
this is no ordinary package.</i>

344
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,784
<i>Inside this package...</i>

345
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:48,288
...is the memory that
you have been waiting for.

346
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:53,293
And you know that when you open it up
you will find what you did that day...

347
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,671
...what you did with the painting.
And now...

348
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,882
...taking your time...

349
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:01,217
...you open it.

350
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,142
Now you're not going to rush...

351
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,689
...because it's a big step
even to have got this far.

352
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,151
Slowly...

353
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,405
...so as not to upset the contents...

354
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,491
...you open it.

355
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,407
-Franck. May I?
-Yeah.

356
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,925
Are you okay?

357
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:25,385
Fine.

358
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:29,097
How did you meet them?

359
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:30,223
Riz...

360
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,727
...I used to buy drugs from Riz.

361
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:38,273
That was it really.
Well, the thing is, I needed money.

362
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:39,524
What for?

363
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,609
Gambling debt.

364
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,738
I was--I am...

365
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,198
...addicted...

366
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,369
...to gambling.

367
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:58,752
I was really good at it, you know.

368
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,925
<i>I wasn't quite good enough, though.</i>

369
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:08,762
<i>And not really good enough
isn't really good at all.</i>

370
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:10,597
<i>Not at that level.</i>

371
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:14,309
I tried to give it up.
I tried everything I could to kick it.

372
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:17,437
-I should have tried hypnotism.
-You should.

373
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:19,147
Maybe next time?

374
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,859
<i>Anyway, I did what all bad gamblers do...</i>

375
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:27,113
<i>...I borrowed more and played
for higher and higher stakes hoping...</i>

376
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,115
<i>...that my luck would change.</i>

377
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,658
And when that didn't happen...

378
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,913
<i>...I panicked.</i>

379
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,668
<i>To various people...</i>

380
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:45,298
...in various ways
I am in for money I don't have.

381
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:46,925
Never will.

382
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,136
<i>This painting came in.</i>

383
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:53,556
<i>-This fucking painting.</i>
-Are you a gambling man, Simon?

384
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,977
Because I'll wager you,
anything you care to name...

385
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:01,606
...that I can flog this in the autumn sale
for over 25 million.

386
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,066
Sterling.

387
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:09,239
<i>And I know it sounds ridiculous, an inside job,
but it just seemed like the answer.</i>

388
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:13,618
I didn't know any criminals so I thought
Riz might. He brought me here.

389
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:19,749
<i>He introduced me to Franck.</i>

390
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:31,011
<i>Franck cleared my debt
in return for the painting.</i>

391
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:34,681
<i>I owe him a lot of money.</i>

392
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:39,686
And I don't know what I'm going to do.

393
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,441
<i>He's afraid that once he's remembered,
you'll kill him.</i>

394
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:46,526
<i>-That's ridiculous.
-Is it?</i>

395
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,613
Let's talk about killing.
Have you ever killed anyone, Dominic?

396
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:55,201
Well, yeah, in Iraq. Loads, obviously.

397
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:58,830
But that's artillery, isn't it?
You never get to see exactly who you've...

398
00:33:58,955 --> 00:33:59,956
Nate.

399
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,960
-Killed anyone?
-Define 'killed'.

400
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:07,339
That's exactly why he won't open up.

401
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:11,343
His behavior isn't dysfunctional,
it's entirely logical.

402
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:13,887
It's straightforward self-preservation.

403
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:17,807
Why do you think he cheated you
in the first place?

404
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:19,893
So what do you suggest?

405
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,937
How do we make him feel more secure?

406
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,523
In an ideal world he'd kill you all.

407
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,276
-That would do it, right?
-Ideal.

408
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:30,028
Most likely.

409
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:35,116
Okay. But supposing, for the sake
of argument, we don't go for that.

410
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:36,576
Then what?

411
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:41,790
He needs to see you weak and exposed
to whatever it is you fear the most.

412
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,250
Nonsense.  Not gonna happen.

413
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,252
He needs to know that you're vulnerable.

414
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,755
-If you're suggesting what I think...
-I'm a professional.

415
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,635
-I'm not going to put you on the stage.
-The answer is definitely 'no'.

416
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:58,765
Now the next voice you hear--
will be Simon's.

417
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:02,268
And he is going to say the word
that I have prepared for you.

418
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,938
And when he speaks that word...

419
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,900
...you will descend
into your very own world of fear...

420
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,946
...from which only he can bring you back.

421
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,625
Strawberry.

422
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:58,575
Simon.

423
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,752
Simon, say it!

424
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:10,211
Strawberry.

425
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,679
That was incredible.

426
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,183
Are you all right?

427
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,601
Yeah. Why?

428
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,855
He doesn't know.

429
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,025
Oh, I'm sorry, man.

430
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,562
Shall I scrub your back?

431
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,443
How did you...?

432
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,570
Well, I used to...

433
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,656
...I used to, you know...

434
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,410
So...

435
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:29,624
...we got enough, I think,
to make our boy feel secure.

436
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:31,918
-Safe to remember, all that.
-I think so.

437
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,255
Now we progress. I like that, it's good.

438
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,298
Soon we'll have the painting.

439
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,260
And what about poor old Nate?

440
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:43,847
Does he still fall to pieces
at every mention of the little berry?

441
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,811
No. Sustained post hypnotic suggestion
is more difficult.

442
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:53,356
More difficult, but you can do it, right?

443
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:56,317
Not to everyone, of course.

444
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,489
5%? Correct me if I'm wrong.
5% of the population?

445
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:05,368
Yes. Can be described
as extremely suggestible.

446
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,495
Wow, 5%.

447
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:09,664
Who'd have thought?

448
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:13,251
And what can you make them do?

449
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:16,963
Well, I'm just asking. I'm interested.

450
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,635
All right.

451
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:27,682
Well, let's see, if you had the right person...

452
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,103
...if you get a hold of them, dig right in...

453
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,939
...if you get them under your spell...

454
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:40,737
...if you work hard --and take your time...

455
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,240
...and do it right...

456
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:49,120
...you can make them want to do...

457
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,122
...almost...

458
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:53,541
...anything.

459
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,830
<i>There you are...</i>

460
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:34,082
<i>...in an open-top car...</i>

461
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:38,211
<i>...driving through the French countryside
with a beautiful young woman.</i>

462
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:41,423
<i>And the radio plays some forgotten song...</i>

463
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:46,219
...and the sun burns the back of your heads
in the warm wind...

464
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:49,472
<i>...and with every mile you travel...</i>

465
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:54,436
<i>...all your problems seem so far away
and so long ago.</i>

466
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:05,739
<i>And soon a field of sunflowers gives way
to a low building...</i>

467
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:08,033
<i>...of stone and tile.</i>

468
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,744
<i>The girl's dress, her calves...</i>

469
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:16,207
<i>...leads you through a corridor
to a vast room of paintings.</i>

470
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:18,585
Caravaggio's 'Adoration'.

471
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,050
Cezanne.

472
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,888
Vermeer's 'Concert'.

473
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:32,682
Van Gogh.

474
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,894
Modigliani.

475
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,065
Manet. Degas.

476
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:45,403
And Rembrandt himself.

477
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:56,122
'The Storm On The Sea Of Galilee'.

478
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,709
These are the lost paintings...

479
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:04,923
...all the stolen and destroyed,
but now together...

480
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:07,676
...authenticated, safe.

481
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:13,139
<i>She takes your hand
and leads you into a final room.</i>

482
00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:21,231
<i>And it's in here...</i>

483
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:24,901
<i>...in this magical safe place...</i>

484
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:28,029
<i>...that you feel ready.</i>

485
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:30,949
<i>And you reach into the package...</i>

486
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:34,411
<i>...and you lift out your memory.</i>

487
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:38,707
<i>The memory of what happened that day.
The memory of what you did.</i>

488
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:42,210
And now...

489
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,879
...safe and relaxed...

490
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,965
...you decide to watch.

491
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:50,176
You decide to remember.

492
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:54,681
<i>...fifty thousand pounds.</i>

493
00:41:58,393 --> 00:42:00,311
<i>Sold to paddle 88.</i>

494
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:03,064
I remember that day.

495
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:07,068
<i>I remember. I take the painting.</i>

496
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,990
<i>I carry it in front of me.</i>

497
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,079
<i>And I cut the canvas free
with a razor blade.</i>

498
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:25,378
<i>I conceal the painting.</i>

499
00:42:27,088 --> 00:42:28,840
-I carry on.
-Remember...

500
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:31,843
...no piece of art is worth a human life.
Sound advice that.

501
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:34,137
And I try to remember it.
You see if you can.

502
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:36,097
<i>I discard the razor blade.</i>

503
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:40,685
We are to take the most valuable item,
or items, to a place of safe...

504
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,729
-Franck?!
-Stay back.

505
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,192
Put it down.

506
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:55,158
Simon...

507
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:56,659
<i>He's about to look.</i>

508
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,621
I can't let him.

509
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,089
Don't.

510
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:17,097
From a safe distance...

511
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:20,183
...you see that you have been hit.

512
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:23,645
Simon?!

513
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:26,606
Simon!

514
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:29,317
But you continue to watch.

515
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,696
You continue to remember.

516
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:48,795
I still have it.

517
00:43:50,755 --> 00:43:53,425
I wake up and I still have the painting.

518
00:43:56,761 --> 00:43:59,180
<i>I get up and I go outside. There's a noise.</i>

519
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:03,601
<i>I have to walk away. I cannot stay here,
not with this painting.</i>

520
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:07,731
I feel my heart vibrating.

521
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:13,028
<i>My phone vibrating.</i>

522
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,905
I look at it.

523
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:24,164
<i>The car nearly kills me.</i>

524
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,499
She's in the car.

525
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:27,917
Who is?

526
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:31,338
You are!

527
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,842
Oh my God. Are you all right?

528
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:37,385
Elizabeth?

529
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,930
I'm not Elizabeth.
Shall I call an ambulance?

530
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:42,515
I remember.

531
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,060
I remember everything.

532
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:47,062
Look, why don't I take you to hospital?

533
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:48,188
<i>Yeah.</i>

534
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:54,277
Elizabeth?

535
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:00,533
-Shall I help you with your seat belt?
-Why did you lie to me?

536
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:02,243
What?

537
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:04,454
You made me forget.

538
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,545
-He's got it on him.
-Look, he's got it on him.

539
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:15,882
Okay, maybe I oughta just--
call for that ambulance.

540
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:19,386
Open your jacket. Who called you?

541
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,221
I'm sorry. Will you let me go, please?

542
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:22,806
<i>Tell him where you left it!</i>

543
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,308
<i>I don't want you to go.</i>

544
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:27,727
-Never mind her!
-Forget about her!

545
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,562
Open his jacket!

546
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:35,568
What are you gonna do
with the fucking painting?!

547
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:37,487
Just get him to tell us where he put it.

548
00:45:38,571 --> 00:45:40,573
Tell us where you left it!

549
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:36,880
<i>Simon, can you hear me?</i>

550
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:39,215
Yes, I can hear you.

551
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:41,634
<i>Good. Can you see the blue screen?</i>

552
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:42,802
Yes.

553
00:46:44,512 --> 00:46:46,556
<i>I'm going to show you some images...</i>

554
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:50,977
...while we scan the response generated
in your brain by each one.

555
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:06,242
<i>The images will continue to run but you can
override that by thinking of a particular one.</i>

556
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:11,039
<i>And every 10 seconds the least chosen image
will be discarded until there is only one left.</i>

557
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:14,876
<i>However, every time you think of this one...</i>

558
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:17,671
<i>...you will receive an electric shock.</i>

559
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:21,883
<i>And the more you select it
the higher the voltage.</i>

560
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:24,094
<i>Do you understand?</i>

561
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:25,345
Yeah.

562
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:30,517
Hello.

563
00:47:31,726 --> 00:47:35,063
I slept on the sofa. I was worried about you.

564
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,406
I had this dream.

565
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:47,200
Wasn't a dream.

566
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,542
I am so...

567
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,461
...so, so sorry.

568
00:47:59,212 --> 00:48:01,214
<i>What is a person, Franck?</i>

569
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:05,260
Not my line of work.

570
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,137
It's fine.

571
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:10,098
Being obsessed with someone is fine?

572
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:11,266
No.

573
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,601
But to have feelings...

574
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:16,104
...yes.

575
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:19,065
What we are...

576
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:23,820
...is the sum of everything
we've ever said, done and felt...

577
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:28,908
...all wrapped up in one unique thread
which is constantly being revised and remembered.

578
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:34,622
So to be yourself you have to constantly
remember yourself.

579
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:37,417
It's a full-time job but that's how it works.

580
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:41,755
When you hit him on the head
you broke the thread.

581
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:43,506
He's fixing it...

582
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:46,009
...with false memories, with fantasies.

583
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:48,595
There's a space to fill so...

584
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:51,431
...he fills it with me.

585
00:48:51,598 --> 00:48:53,683
He's in love with you?

586
00:48:53,808 --> 00:48:55,643
We call it transference.

587
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:59,773
I don't know what to say...

588
00:49:00,774 --> 00:49:01,775
...now.

589
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:05,779
Okay. But where is the painting?

590
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:08,114
The same place it's always been.

591
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:10,867
Yes, but now you are the problem.

592
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:12,035
Yes.

593
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:15,288
But I may also be the solution.

594
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:18,375
When in doubt --try something traditional.

595
00:49:20,627 --> 00:49:23,129
Traditional? Okay. Right, how's this?

596
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,382
How would you...

597
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:29,135
...like to, with me, go out somewhere?

598
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:31,513
What, you're gonna screw him, is that it?

599
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,475
You'll fuck him
just to get him to remember?

600
00:49:35,642 --> 00:49:38,728
It's not conventional practice,
but under the circumstances...

601
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:43,525
-Pick me up at 8.
-Where would you like to go?

602
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,236
You choose. I don't care.

603
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:48,154
Coffee's on.

604
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:55,829
-Okay, but you wear a wire.
-Don't be ridiculous.

605
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,878
You can keep the rest. Thanks, man.

606
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:06,506
<i>I don't like the idea
of you being alone with him.</i>

607
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:08,675
<i>I'm not wild about it myself, Franck.</i>

608
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:12,429
So if you can see any other way
to deal with this obsession...

609
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:14,681
...I'd love to hear it.

610
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:34,868
I'm glad I had you choose the place.
It's nice.

611
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:37,620
It is. I haven't been here in a while.

612
00:50:37,746 --> 00:50:39,414
Thank you very much.

613
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:42,459
-So what do you recommend?
-I...

614
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:46,963
...usually have the steak, which is a lie.

615
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:50,967
I don't usually have the steak. I...

616
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:53,428
...I've never been here before.

617
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:55,972
Simon. You need therapy.

618
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,101
I've been feeling a little confused lately.

619
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,937
I just imagined I'd been here before.

620
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,982
I could have sworn that
I'd met that waiter before.

621
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,780
-And then what happens?
-I give him what he wants...

622
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:13,990
<i>...he's mine.</i>

623
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:17,327
<i>And after that, he gives me what I want...</i>

624
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:21,331
-...what we want.
-Just like that?

625
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:25,502
He isn't really receiving electric shocks.

626
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,758
He only believes he is.

627
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:56,825
<i>Just here. If you just pull in here
on the left, thank you.</i>

628
00:51:58,034 --> 00:52:00,453
This is, this is me, actually.

629
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:02,497
Okay?

630
00:52:04,332 --> 00:52:06,334
-It's all right.
-Okay. Have a good night.

631
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:20,140
<i>There's a problem. He's jealous.</i>

632
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:21,266
<i>Jealous?</i>

633
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:26,062
Of me? That's so cute. And that's why
he doesn't wanna sleep with you.

634
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:29,691
It's complicated
but that's what he said. Yes.

635
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:34,779
-I really wonder how he gets that.
-Ask yourself.

636
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:37,824
Because now it's my fault?

637
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:40,035
I'm not assigning blame, Franck.

638
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,788
But you are always. You can't do it
because of this, because of that.

639
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:47,208
There is always something
but it's never your fault, right?

640
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:49,502
"It's a partnership, Franck."

641
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:53,006
"He's got to respect me, Franck."
"We've gotta make him feel safe."

642
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:55,050
"We've gotta show him our fear."

643
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:58,511
"In an ideal world, Franck, he'd kill us all."

644
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:03,266
In an ideal world, Elizabeth,
you'd go hypnotize the guy.

645
00:53:03,391 --> 00:53:07,896
You'd bring me back the painting
and you'd stop wasting my fucking time.

646
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,029
Wait.

647
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:17,924
Jesus!

648
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,723
-Fucking hell.<i>
-Simon, it's Nate. We need to talk.</i>

649
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,600
Come up.

650
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:03,261
I must remember never to forget...

651
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:06,431
...that you're a criminal.

652
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:22,655
You got a boyfriend?

653
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:24,449
Now you ask?

654
00:55:26,326 --> 00:55:27,327
No.

655
00:55:27,827 --> 00:55:29,454
I'm single.

656
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,040
How is that possible?

657
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:36,169
I was in a relationship...

658
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,172
...he was violent...

659
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:41,883
...so now I'm not.

660
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:45,387
Got his address?

661
00:55:46,846 --> 00:55:48,682
That's very kind...

662
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:51,184
...but 'no, thank you'.

663
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,561
You should get even.

664
00:55:53,895 --> 00:55:55,563
Get a little angry.

665
00:55:56,856 --> 00:55:59,192
To be angry is to be a victim.

666
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:01,319
I've moved on.

667
00:56:02,737 --> 00:56:05,073
That's the only real victory.

668
00:56:10,662 --> 00:56:12,997
So why are you doing this, then?

669
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:16,418
Because it makes a change.

670
00:56:18,878 --> 00:56:22,090
If you had to deal
with morbid obesity and...

671
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:24,509
...panic attacks...

672
00:56:26,761 --> 00:56:28,930
...you'd see the attraction.

673
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:36,896
Can I tell you something?

674
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:44,904
I'd rather not.

675
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:19,147
<i>When the sandman blows your eyes</i>

676
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:22,317
<i>Who'll be there?</i>

677
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:40,960
Hey.

678
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:46,007
Listen, I...

679
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,510
...I...

680
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:52,347
...can you...

681
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:55,392
Can you see me again?

682
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,396
It's not exactly what I wanted to say, but...

683
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:02,732
I mean, you know...

684
00:58:05,902 --> 00:58:08,655
Yeah. I think so.

685
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:12,200
Good.

686
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:17,539
Be careful.

687
00:58:23,753 --> 00:58:27,007
<i>And as the image grows closer
and clearer...</i>

688
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:29,592
...you find you are watching
what he did to you.

689
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:34,848
You are watching the terrible things
that he did. But, with every blow...

690
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:37,600
...that you watch rain down upon you...

691
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:43,064
...you become only more determined
than ever.

692
00:58:43,857 --> 00:58:46,526
<i>You know that it's possible...</i>

693
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,612
<i>...to change your life and move on.</i>

694
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:52,365
That you will not let this define you.

695
00:58:52,782 --> 00:58:56,536
You will not let yourself
be violated by the memory...

696
00:58:56,786 --> 00:58:59,456
...as you are violated by the act.

697
00:59:24,439 --> 00:59:25,440
Simon?

698
00:59:27,233 --> 00:59:30,570
-This all part of your plan, yeah?
-What are you talking about?

699
00:59:30,737 --> 00:59:31,988
The two of you.

700
00:59:32,113 --> 00:59:35,158
Planning it together. Gonna get it out of me
and then dump me.

701
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:39,621
-Simon, will you calm down, please.
-How long have you been fucking Franck?

702
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:44,000
-Where did that come from?
-It's true, though, isn't it?

703
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,420
-You know it isn't.
-Why would Nate lie about something like that?

704
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:50,840
Because he wants Franck out.
He wants the painting for himself.

705
00:59:50,965 --> 00:59:53,009
I don't fucking believe you!

706
00:59:53,134 --> 00:59:57,806
Don't believe what? The existence of greed
in human beings? Grow up!

707
00:59:58,598 --> 01:00:01,685
For the past week, you've made
every kind of excuse not to touch me...

708
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:05,814
...and now that the moment's come,
you resort to some insane fantasy...

709
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:18,660
Wait.

710
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:20,662
Wait.

711
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:24,541
I know what you want.

712
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:27,210
There's something I have to do.

713
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,461
How did you know?

714
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:53,963
You told me.

715
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:56,925
Close your eyes.

716
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:04,891
<i>Simon.</i>

717
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:11,398
<i>Relax.</i>

718
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:45,640
-You know where it is now?
-Maybe.

719
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:47,809
Told her yet?

720
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:53,773
-You wanna talk?
-Yeah, it's about time.

721
01:03:08,538 --> 01:03:09,539
So...

722
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,041
...Simon...

723
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,961
...we're all here.
Do you wanna talk us through it?

724
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,132
-Yeah.
-Good.

725
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:23,345
Yeah, I really do. I...

726
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:32,312
-I'm sorry, I just feel a bit nervous.
-Come on, it's all right.

727
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:35,565
Okay. Do you mind if I use your...

728
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:38,234
-Yeah, please, please...
-I'll just be a minute.

729
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:20,235
-So how long's this gonna take?
-It's all right. I told him to wait.

730
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:22,529
He'll lie. I bet you anything he lies.

731
01:04:22,612 --> 01:04:24,364
He'd better fucking not.

732
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:27,242
Don't worry, if it turns out he's lying,
we just kill him.

733
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:30,286
Hang on, we're gonna kill him anyway,
aren't we?

734
01:04:30,912 --> 01:04:32,372
There's that.

735
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:46,219
Fuck!

736
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:52,726
Fuck.

737
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:02,152
-Hello?<i>
-It's me.</i>

738
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:04,070
Simon?

739
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:07,574
<i>-Where are you?</i>
-I'm at Franck's house.

740
01:05:07,657 --> 01:05:09,492
Jesus. What are you doing there?

741
01:05:09,617 --> 01:05:12,245
-Elizabeth, they're going to kill me.<i>
-No.</i>

742
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:15,248
You were right. This is what
they always planned to do.

743
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:18,918
<i>Don't you see, this is why
I had to hide the painting.</i>

744
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:20,920
Simon, calm down.

745
01:05:21,921 --> 01:05:24,924
-Where are you now?<i>
-In the hallway. The doors are locked.</i>

746
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,761
All the doors are locked.

747
01:05:27,844 --> 01:05:30,180
Go upstairs to Franck's bedroom.

748
01:05:33,975 --> 01:05:35,643
<i>There's a pool...</i>

749
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:37,937
<i>...and a hallway.</i>

750
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:44,194
<i>-Do you see the bedside table?</i>
-Yes.

751
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:45,945
<i>Open the drawer.</i>

752
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:49,115
<i>No, the lower one.</i>

753
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,620
<i>-Is there a gun?</i>
-Yes.

754
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:55,789
-Do you think you can use it?<i>
-I don't know.</i>

755
01:05:55,872 --> 01:05:57,874
I've never used one before.

756
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,877
<i>-Do you want me to call the police?</i>
-No, no...

757
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:11,971
No, it's better this way.

758
01:06:17,894 --> 01:06:18,895
Elizabeth?

759
01:06:19,729 --> 01:06:20,730
<i>Yes?</i>

760
01:06:22,732 --> 01:06:25,068
I have something to tell you.

761
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,239
Are you ready?

762
01:06:32,742 --> 01:06:34,035
I remember.

763
01:06:35,203 --> 01:06:37,372
<i>I remember where I put it.</i>

764
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:42,377
-You don't have to tell me.<i>
-No, no. I do.</i>

765
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,339
<i>I might never see you again.</i>

766
01:06:48,049 --> 01:06:51,219
I need to tell you where it is.

767
01:06:57,934 --> 01:06:59,269
<i>Tell me now.</i>

768
01:07:00,061 --> 01:07:04,607
It's in a red Alfa Romeo in the underground
car park in Marble Arch.

769
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:07,861
<i>I love you, Simon.</i>

770
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:09,571
I love you, too.

771
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:34,095
Please, Simon.

772
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:37,640
Calm down, you've got it all wrong.
It's not what you think.

773
01:07:43,229 --> 01:07:46,941
She's using you, Simon.
She's using you like she used us.

774
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:06,920
She has been using you
from the start, Simon.

775
01:09:03,476 --> 01:09:04,477
Elizabeth?

776
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:10,775
Elizabeth?

777
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:36,259
So where has she gone? Huh?

778
01:09:36,384 --> 01:09:38,928
Don't let her get away. Not after all this.

779
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:40,722
I know, Franck.

780
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:46,311
-I know what you were going to do to me.
-She put that there. It's not real.

781
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:49,647
She's not coming back, Simon.
Once she gets it, she's gone!

782
01:09:50,065 --> 01:09:52,567
If I wanted to kill you, why aren't you dead?

783
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:55,570
Because she loves me. And I love her!

784
01:10:02,994 --> 01:10:05,246
That's what she thinks of you.

785
01:10:05,789 --> 01:10:10,251
It's my gun. It's empty.
She took it from my apartment.

786
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:17,717
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

787
01:10:21,012 --> 01:10:22,931
I got this.

788
01:10:24,849 --> 01:10:25,850
So...

789
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:27,852
...who knows?

790
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:30,522
-She does.
-You leave her alone.

791
01:10:38,029 --> 01:10:40,031
He found it the first time.

792
01:10:40,156 --> 01:10:42,367
The first time he came to see me.

793
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:43,910
Remember?

794
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:46,830
You thought you'd just found your car keys.

795
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:50,500
<i>But you were right, it's in there.</i>

796
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,878
-It's in the car.
-I took it to pieces. It's not in there.

797
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:58,383
No, it's not in his car. In the other car.

798
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:00,552
The red one.

799
01:11:02,137 --> 01:11:05,348
-Where is it?
-Please, I can show you.

800
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:06,474
I can show you.

801
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:09,853
Get him dressed.

802
01:11:15,358 --> 01:11:18,570
Go and get it. And take him with you.

803
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:21,698
-What is this?
-You're lucky you're still in, Franck.

804
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:23,116
Go and get it.

805
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:28,163
Bring it back here
and we'll keep an eye on her. Promise.

806
01:11:34,544 --> 01:11:36,046
Say something.

807
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:45,430
Allow the mushy shit.

808
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:48,183
Doesn't give up, does she?

809
01:11:56,941 --> 01:11:58,610
Go and get it, boss.

810
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:01,696
Like he says, you're lucky you're still in.

811
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:29,766
-Drink?
-Yeah. Cheers, mate.

812
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:48,284
Franck.

813
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,048
You see what she gave to me, Franck.

814
01:13:03,174 --> 01:13:05,343
That's what she thinks of me.

815
01:13:25,613 --> 01:13:27,282
Oh my God!

816
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:34,372
-Allow me, bruv, I didn't touch her.
-Wait, wait.

817
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:35,498
Fuck!

818
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:44,382
You knew.

819
01:13:53,808 --> 01:13:54,809
You...

820
01:13:54,934 --> 01:13:56,394
Help me!

821
01:13:57,228 --> 01:13:58,813
...you knew...

822
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:03,068
...what I would like...

823
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,278
...didn't you?

824
01:14:08,698 --> 01:14:10,950
Help me. Help me.

825
01:14:17,582 --> 01:14:20,085
-Okay.
-Get down the stairs. Get down the stairs!

826
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:23,880
No, no, no...

827
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:25,340
Please?

828
01:14:26,174 --> 01:14:27,384
Please don't.

829
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,220
He can help us. Simon?

830
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:32,514
Please.

831
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:34,265
-You go.
-Okay.

832
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:46,152
It's really silly of me.
I've been out of the country. And...

833
01:14:46,277 --> 01:14:49,906
...I'm such an idiot. Everything's a mess
and I can't find the ticket...

834
01:14:49,989 --> 01:14:51,741
...but I really need the car.

835
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:54,786
Â£1,848.

836
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:57,997
Not a mistake I'll make again.

837
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:27,610
Not here.

838
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:31,865
Franck knows a good place.
Don't you, Franck?

839
01:15:32,365 --> 01:15:34,200
You can drive. On you go.

840
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,620
You, too. You sit in the back.

841
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:54,512
Tie your hand on to the wheel. Tie it tight.

842
01:16:01,519 --> 01:16:03,855
Tighter than that. Here you go.

843
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:21,498
I would like to know what happened.

844
01:16:22,248 --> 01:16:24,751
It's all inside my head, isn't it?

845
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:28,338
There's something hidden...

846
01:16:29,547 --> 01:16:31,216
...inside me.

847
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:35,220
-What is it?
-It's a memory.

848
01:16:36,096 --> 01:16:37,764
A memory?

849
01:16:38,014 --> 01:16:39,432
Suppressed?

850
01:16:42,268 --> 01:16:44,104
-Yeah.
-Simon...

851
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:49,067
...maybe there are some things
it's better never to remember.

852
01:16:49,275 --> 01:16:50,276
Don't!

853
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:55,031
Franck, you're alive because I allow it,
but I can change my mind.

854
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:57,117
I have free will.

855
01:16:57,242 --> 01:16:58,952
-Don't I?
-Yeah, yeah.

856
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:01,121
-Don't I?!
-Yes.

857
01:17:01,246 --> 01:17:02,914
All right, then.

858
01:17:03,623 --> 01:17:05,875
All right, then, let's see if I do.

859
01:17:08,586 --> 01:17:10,422
You take me to it.

860
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:14,134
So...

861
01:17:15,635 --> 01:17:18,096
...it's a year and a half earlier.

862
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,268
You wanna stop gambling. That's all.

863
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:28,773
All in.

864
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:32,110
<i>You select a hypnotherapist at random.</i>

865
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:34,404
<i>And so you go to meet her.</i>

866
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:39,075
-Simon Newton.
-Thank you very much.

867
01:17:39,909 --> 01:17:40,910
Hello.

868
01:17:42,996 --> 01:17:44,789
-I'm Elizabeth Lamb.
-Hello, there.

869
01:17:44,914 --> 01:17:47,000
-Nice to meet you.
-Simon Newton. Hello.

870
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,419
-Have a seat.
-Thank you very much.

871
01:17:51,296 --> 01:17:54,591
So...what would you like to talk about?

872
01:17:54,674 --> 01:18:00,263
Now I have a moderate problem
with online gambling.

873
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:05,185
I still have enough money
to pay for dinner and things, though.

874
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:08,688
<i>You get along well.
There is an immediate rapport.</i>

875
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:11,149
And so treatment begins.

876
01:18:11,816 --> 01:18:17,364
<i>But your addiction is hard to crack
and repeated sessions are required.</i>

877
01:18:17,489 --> 01:18:20,158
Cheers. We should do this with alcohol.

878
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:25,205
<i>You grow close to the therapist.</i>

879
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:28,375
I miss you when I'm not here.

880
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:30,210
<i>Too close.</i>

881
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:34,673
And so you begin an affair.

882
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:40,053
A strongly sexual affair.

883
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:42,722
You stay there.

884
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:44,891
<i>She knows that it's wrong.</i>

885
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:49,896
<i>She shouldn't do this,
not with a client. But she does.</i>

886
01:18:50,063 --> 01:18:54,484
If you look at the Sistine Chapel,
there's tons of flesh but there's no hair.

887
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:58,571
The hair serves to remind us
of our biology. Our origin.

888
01:18:58,697 --> 01:19:02,575
But without it
there's a perfection, untainted.

889
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:07,414
Anyway, art moved on, as it must, it has to.
But, actually, no, it was Goya's fault.

890
01:19:07,747 --> 01:19:12,419
'The Naked Maja'.
After that, it's always there, the hair.

891
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:14,004
Yeah, that's the lady.

892
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:17,424
That's modern art. No perfection anymore.

893
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:19,426
Hey.

894
01:19:24,764 --> 01:19:26,474
Okay, I get it.

895
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,770
<i>She will do anything for you.</i>

896
01:19:32,897 --> 01:19:34,733
<i>You fall in love...</i>

897
01:19:35,442 --> 01:19:37,610
<i>...with a kind of perfection.</i>

898
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:40,113
<i>The kind you like.</i>

899
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:42,949
-You're an elephant?
-No, I'm not an elephant.

900
01:19:43,074 --> 01:19:47,454
No, it's the Goya. It's 'The Witches In The Air'
that I was telling you about.

901
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,461
<i>But then you become possessive.</i>

902
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:58,965
<i>Suspicious. Night and day...</i>

903
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:03,094
...you fear that you will lose her.
It torments you.

904
01:20:05,597 --> 01:20:07,599
<i>And you become jealous.</i>

905
01:20:08,266 --> 01:20:10,352
-Who are you texting?
-Sorry, work.

906
01:20:10,477 --> 01:20:12,979
<i>You start to believe that
you depend upon her.</i>

907
01:20:13,813 --> 01:20:16,316
<i>That without her you will die.</i>

908
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:21,321
<i>You start to hate her
as much as you love her.</i>

909
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:24,532
And then one evening...

910
01:20:24,657 --> 01:20:27,619
<i>...after you've accused her
of looking at another man...</i>

911
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:29,371
You keep your mouth shut!

912
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:32,957
Why don't you just sit down.
Don't they make a beautiful couple?

913
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:36,127
You can just look at him now.
Just feast your fucking eyes!

914
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,880
-Elizabeth.
-No, I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

915
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,182
<i>She knows she has to get out.</i>

916
01:20:50,183 --> 01:20:54,145
She has to break it off
but you won't let her go.

917
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:55,814
You persist.

918
01:20:56,690 --> 01:21:01,986
<i>You apologize. You write long letters
vowing never to do it again.</i>

919
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:04,364
<i>You weep, you call.</i>

920
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:06,074
She is frightened.

921
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:08,243
I need to talk to you for 2 minutes.

922
01:21:08,493 --> 01:21:10,704
<i>-Really frightened now.</i>
-Please let me come in.

923
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:13,665
<i>And she knows if this goes on...</i>

924
01:21:14,874 --> 01:21:17,168
...there can be only one outcome.

925
01:21:17,877 --> 01:21:19,713
Hi. How are you doing?

926
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:24,718
I just need you to let me apologize
and see that you accept that.

927
01:21:24,843 --> 01:21:29,514
I need to see that in your eyes
and then I'll leave you alone. I promise.

928
01:21:29,931 --> 01:21:31,558
<i>In the end...</i>

929
01:21:33,226 --> 01:21:36,396
<i>...she knows that you will kill her.</i>

930
01:21:37,063 --> 01:21:40,233
Please, stop! Simon, you're hurting me.

931
01:21:40,358 --> 01:21:42,569
-It's okay.
-No, it's not okay.

932
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:45,613
<i>The police are not interested.</i>

933
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:50,076
<i>Lawyers advise her to change her name,
to leave the country...</i>

934
01:21:50,201 --> 01:21:52,203
<i>...but she will not do this.</i>

935
01:21:54,706 --> 01:21:57,542
<i>She will not be a victim twice over.</i>

936
01:22:00,253 --> 01:22:02,630
<i>Instead, she will take control.</i>

937
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,759
So she perverts the therapy...

938
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:08,762
<i>...you've insisted on continuing.</i>

939
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:10,472
Simon...

940
01:22:12,599 --> 01:22:15,226
...it's not the gambling that
you want to forget.

941
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,228
It's me.

942
01:22:19,272 --> 01:22:21,441
You want to forget me.

943
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:24,778
You made me forget?

944
01:22:26,279 --> 01:22:28,448
She makes you want to forget.

945
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,285
You're forgetting me.

946
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:36,331
You're forgetting us.

947
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:40,293
And you feel so much more relaxed.
So much more free.

948
01:22:40,418 --> 01:22:41,419
Leave.

949
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:47,133
<i>And gradually-- day by day...</i>

950
01:22:48,259 --> 01:22:51,137
...week by week you do.

951
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,932
You call less often.

952
01:22:54,974 --> 01:22:57,602
The passions subside.

953
01:22:58,478 --> 01:23:00,647
<i>You're late for therapy.</i>

954
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:04,984
<i>Then one day you don't come at all.</i>

955
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:09,989
<i>At last you have suppressed the memory
of me.</i>

956
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,163
But you knew.

957
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:23,461
<i>You knew I'd come back...</i>

958
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:25,296
<i>...one day.</i>

959
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:29,843
<i>Your memory is not destroyed.</i>

960
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:32,220
<i>It is locked in a cage.</i>

961
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:35,348
<i>And with enough...</i>

962
01:23:35,473 --> 01:23:36,808
<i>...force...</i>

963
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:39,811
<i>...enough violence...</i>

964
01:23:40,311 --> 01:23:42,647
<i>...the lock can be broken.</i>

965
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:51,906
It comes back, the memory.

966
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:54,325
Not completely.

967
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:58,538
<i>Not entirely, but enough to drive you...</i>

968
01:23:58,705 --> 01:24:01,374
...to make you feel you have been cheated.

969
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:05,211
Enough to make you angry.

970
01:24:05,378 --> 01:24:06,379
Franck!

971
01:24:16,222 --> 01:24:18,058
What did she look like?

972
01:24:20,685 --> 01:24:21,686
You.

973
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:24,731
God, are you all right?

974
01:24:25,231 --> 01:24:26,274
Elizabeth.

975
01:24:26,691 --> 01:24:28,443
No, I'm not Elizabeth.

976
01:24:28,568 --> 01:24:30,445
Shall I call for an ambulance?

977
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,197
I remember.

978
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:36,701
-I remember everything.
-Why don't I take you to hospital?

979
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:40,872
As the memory comes back...

980
01:24:40,955 --> 01:24:41,998
Okay?

981
01:24:42,415 --> 01:24:45,293
-Shall I help you with your seat belt?
-Why did you lie to me?

982
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:48,129
-What?
-You made me forget.

983
01:24:50,757 --> 01:24:53,093
Okay, maybe I should just call
for that ambulance.

984
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:56,596
-Will you let go of me, please?
-I don't want you to go.

985
01:24:57,305 --> 01:24:58,932
I don't want you to go.

986
01:24:59,391 --> 01:25:00,642
And then...

987
01:25:00,767 --> 01:25:03,561
Look, I'm sorry,
whoever Elizabeth is, she isn't me.

988
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:51,484
<i>A few months later you came back.</i>

989
01:25:53,611 --> 01:25:55,196
Mr. Maxwell?

990
01:25:57,323 --> 01:25:58,950
Mr. Maxwell?

991
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,369
That's...

992
01:26:02,495 --> 01:26:03,997
...that's me.

993
01:26:09,502 --> 01:26:11,296
Is something the matter?

994
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:16,009
Of course not.

995
01:26:16,301 --> 01:26:18,970
I'm Elizabeth...Lamb.

996
01:26:19,554 --> 01:26:23,641
<i>You've come to find your car keys.
Well, they're just right in here.</i>

997
01:26:23,725 --> 01:26:24,726
Stop.

998
01:26:28,813 --> 01:26:30,982
Can you give her the keys, Franck?

999
01:26:44,537 --> 01:26:46,206
It's in the back.

1000
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:27,122
Is it there, Elizabeth?

1001
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,919
Elizabeth, is it there?!

1002
01:27:50,895 --> 01:27:52,564
I'm sorry.

1003
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:22,010
I don't want it.

1004
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:26,598
I don't know that I ever really did.

1005
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:35,148
Maybe you can tell me sometime.

1006
01:28:47,452 --> 01:28:48,453
No!

1007
01:28:59,172 --> 01:29:00,340
No.

1008
01:29:00,423 --> 01:29:02,842
No, no, no...

1009
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,557
Simon, you don't have to do this.

1010
01:29:10,225 --> 01:29:14,354
I want... to forget that you did all this.

1011
01:29:26,032 --> 01:29:27,033
No.

1012
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,051
Please!

1013
01:31:10,011 --> 01:31:11,554
Bring it to me.

1014
01:31:37,997 --> 01:31:39,374
Stop, please!

1015
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:19,205
Are you okay?

1016
01:32:20,123 --> 01:32:21,124
No!

1017
01:32:30,133 --> 01:32:31,176
Hey!

1018
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:39,392
Shall I tell you something?

1019
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:47,025
I'd rather not.

1020
01:32:53,782 --> 01:32:55,784
There's a parcel for Le Pere.

1021
01:32:57,077 --> 01:32:58,411
Thank you.

1022
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:15,762
<i>Hello, Franck.</i>

1023
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:18,431
<i>It looks good...</i>

1024
01:33:19,265 --> 01:33:20,934
<i>...don't you think?</i>

1025
01:33:21,184 --> 01:33:22,936
<i>Hanging on the wall.</i>

1026
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:27,816
<i>I thought it might make me
think too much of him, but...</i>

1027
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:31,361
<i>...instead I think of you.</i>

1028
01:33:31,986 --> 01:33:35,323
<i>You want me to send it back, don't you?</i>

1029
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:38,702
<i>Or sell it...</i>

1030
01:33:38,827 --> 01:33:41,454
<i>...and divide the money.</i>

1031
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:43,665
<i>But...</i>

1032
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:47,627
<i>...you know I can't do that.</i>

1033
01:33:49,879 --> 01:33:52,298
<i>Not when it means so much to me.</i>

1034
01:33:53,508 --> 01:33:56,011
<i>Not when I've worked so hard for it.</i>

1035
01:33:56,511 --> 01:33:59,472
<i>Simon, you're forgetting me.</i>

1036
01:34:01,307 --> 01:34:03,351
You're forgetting us.

1037
01:34:03,476 --> 01:34:06,187
Even when you have forgotten
the one you love...

1038
01:34:06,855 --> 01:34:08,648
<i>...you will gamble...</i>

1039
01:34:09,065 --> 01:34:11,484
<i>...lie, cheat...</i>

1040
01:34:12,235 --> 01:34:13,737
...and steal.

1041
01:34:14,362 --> 01:34:15,363
Sold!

1042
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:17,741
Steal for her a painting.

1043
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:20,702
<i>Simon, a painting...</i>

1044
01:34:21,327 --> 01:34:23,204
<i>...for the woman you hurt.</i>

1045
01:34:23,872 --> 01:34:26,332
For the woman you left behind.

1046
01:34:41,848 --> 01:34:45,560
<i>Now perhaps, some day, you'll find me.</i>

1047
01:34:46,686 --> 01:34:48,313
<i>I hope that you do.</i>

1048
01:34:49,356 --> 01:34:52,233
<i>But, if it's all too much...</i>

1049
01:34:52,859 --> 01:34:55,362
<i>...if you wish that we'd never met...</i>

1050
01:34:57,405 --> 01:34:59,574
<i>...that it had never happened...</i>

1051
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,535
<i>...I can make it go away, Franck.</i>

1052
01:35:02,702 --> 01:35:05,163
<i>All you have to do is touch the screen.</i>

1053
01:35:05,413 --> 01:35:07,207
<i>Press right here...</i>

1054
01:35:09,709 --> 01:35:12,337
<i>...and follow my voice.</i>

1055
01:35:12,587 --> 01:35:14,756
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

1056
01:35:14,881 --> 01:35:18,093
<i>Do you want to remember...or...</i>

1057
01:35:18,385 --> 01:35:18,093
<i>...do you want to forget?</i>
