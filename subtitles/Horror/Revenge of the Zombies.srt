00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:24,216
Davvers! Davvers! Stop! Cut it!

3
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,032
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

4
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,549
What is it? Roman stuff?

5
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:36,666
Can't be Roman.
They didn't have kings.

6
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,067
They had emperors and shit.

7
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:41,071
My mate was on a site last year,
said they found a load of Roman coins.

8
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,341
That was worth tons.

9
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:45,591
- It's not fucking Roman, you muppet!
- But it might have other stuff.

10
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,591
- Yeah, like what?
- Gold and stuff.

11
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,341
Ugh... Stinks down here.

12
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:05,507
- [FARTS] Does now.
- Argh... Davvers!

13
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,674
- Whoa...
- Bloody hell.

14
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:12,791
It's a graveyard.

15
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,174
It's a plague pit, more like!

16
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:17,841
We can't nick stuff from a graveyard.

17
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,674
- Can we?
- I don't care.

18
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:22,757
They're dead already, ain't they?

19
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,966
What was that?

20
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:34,007
Probably just wind or sumthin'.

21
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,132
Jesus! Don't do that!

22
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,591
That was classic. Your face...

23
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,407
We better go...
tell the boss what we found.

24
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,257
What? What's the matter?
You scared of a few skeletons?

25
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:54,049
Wooah! Wooo!
I'm a ghost. Wooooo!

26
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:55,850
God, you're such a pansy!

27
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,007
Piss off!

28
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:03,924
- Um, be... behind ya...
- Yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

29
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:06,049
- Like I'm gonna fall for that one.
- No, seriously. Mate! Behind ya!

30
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:09,632
Get it off me!

31
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,132

32
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,924
- You paid cash?
- Yeah.

33
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:09,049
Used a false name?

34
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,466
Yes, just like you said.

35
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:13,799
Where the fuck did you get it, mate?
A bomb site?

36
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,299
Why can't we use our car anyway?

37
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,966
'Cause they'll trace it
back to us, won't they?

38
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,299
This is clean.

39
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:23,091
If this even starts at all.
Have you tried it?

40
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:24,716
No.

41
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:37,799
Okay, Andy, two problems here, uh...
One, it doesn't start.

42
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,466
And two, there's a dirty,
filthy, cummy sock... in there.

43
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:48,549
Say, let's see what happens.

44
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,466
Oh, yeah!

45
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,507
Come on, let's go
and magic us a full breakfast, yeah?

46
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,206
Look, I'm just saying,

47
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,702
I don't want the van to conk out on us
in the middle of a job, that's all.

48
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:04,916
B-elax, we'll be fine.

49
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,091
Yeah, you say that 'cause
you're a jammy git.

50
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,674
If you fell off that
building right there,

51
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:10,174
and landed into a thimble full of shit,

52
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:13,091
you'd come out smelling of roses,
with frayed birds on your arms.

53
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:15,382
Yeah, that's 'cause
I'm engaging my ideas.

54
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:16,383
That's talent, that is.

55
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,216
A talent for getting us into trouble.

56
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,732
When have I ever got us into trouble?

57
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:20,657
Yeah, I'll take you all on!

58
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:23,358
And so will my fucking brother!
You dirty pikeys!

59
00:06:23,658 --> 00:06:26,282
You do not want to mess with
me and my fucking brother!

60
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:28,049
- Fucking what?
- Terry!

61
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:31,049
Yeah, well, they were asking for it.
I had to stick up for meself.

62
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,482
Look, all I'm saying is that
you've got to be really careful about...

63
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:34,966
Jesus Christ!

64
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,766
- All right, Mickey?
- Hello, mate.

65
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:47,007
Why wouldn't I be all right, huh?

66
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,882
You saying I'm some sort of
nutter or sumthin'?

67
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:52,299
No, I was...just saying...

68
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,549
- He's joking.
- Your face...

69
00:06:57,592 --> 00:06:59,382
So, we still on for 2 o'clock or what?

70
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,632
Yeah, that we are.
We are still on for 2 o'clock.

71
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,841
I mean, you've heard what happens
when people mess me about.

72
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:10,466
Fucking mug! You... fucking mug!...

73
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,182
We heard about that, yeah, yeah.

74
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:13,132
Good.

75
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,549
So, don't mess me about.

76
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,299
Beautiful motor this is, gents.

77
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,216
Oh, cheers, mate, yeah.
It's a nice one, yeah, yeah...

78
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,674
Top of the range, this is, right? Yeah.

79
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:26,674
RIGHT!

80
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,132
Be lucky, yeah?

81
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,466
Right.

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,716
He's just dented my
fucking car with his head.

83
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:41,007
He's got a steel plate in there.
Iraq war injury.

84
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,841
Buried in there to remove part
of his brain or something.

85
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:46,424
The part that stops him from
being a fucking psychopath.

86
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,382
"Be lucky".

87
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:52,007
Mate, he's the man for the job.

88
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:54,174
- Yeah, you sure?
- He's the man.

89
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,216
Eddie, I told you
not to call this number.

90
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:00,317
It'll leave a record.

91
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,442
They're on to us.
I'll need to move the cash.

92
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,569
Can you get it ready?
I'll send someone over to pick it up.

93
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,691
What? All of it?

94
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:09,116
- But there's two and a half...
- Listen! They're sending inspectors.

95
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:10,567
I want it all out of the way.

96
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:13,749
- You'll have the forms ready?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:21,632
Davvers! Greg!
Got a job for ya!

98
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:27,924
Davvers! Greg!
Where are you, you pair of tits?

99
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:42,216
Oi! Get the fuck out of it,
you two-bob toe-rags.

100
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:46,007
I told you! You come 'round here again,
I'm gonna slap the shit out of ya!

101
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:47,716
Well, now it's time to pay the piper.

102
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:49,716
Hey, listen, old man.
You need to behave yourself,

103
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:51,966
before me and my boys fuck
you up, do ya understand?

104
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,372
Leave it out, Ray.
You're driving away all my customers!

105
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:59,382
You're supposed to take your pills!
Not sell up to these mugs!

106
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,466
Well, I've got to earn a crust, don't I?

107
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,716
Here you are, lads, gather 'round.

108
00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:11,257
I've got anything here, look.
I've got codeine, sleeping pills...

109
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,716
Here they are,
slower than the army!

110
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:14,932
All right, granddad?

111
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:17,591
Don't call me granddad!
I have told you, it makes me sound old!

112
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,882
- But you are old.
- Yes? How's that for old, eh?

113
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:22,457
You're late again!

114
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:24,958
The Macguire genes
must have passed youse two by.

115
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:28,424
Your mum and dad will be spinning
in their graves, God rest their souls.

116
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,674
Yeah, they were cremated though,
weren't they, granddad?

117
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:33,099
- Don't give me none of your back-chat!
- All right.

118
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,841
Now, come on! There's people in
there waiting for their dinners!

119
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,299
All right.

120
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:59,549
- Hello...
- All right, how're you doing?

121
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:02,341
It's high time youse two
got a proper job.

122
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:03,757
This is a proper job.

123
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:06,174
When I was 15,
I lied about my age,

124
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:09,216
so's I could sign up,
and fight the fuckin' Nazis.

125
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:14,424
Argh! I've heard of you Nazi mugs!
Let's fucking have it!

126
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,174
What are youse two fighting?
Traffic?

127
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:19,049
We do okay.

128
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,957
Okay? Let me mark your card, sunshine.

129
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:28,216
Delivering 'Meals on Wheels' to old-age
pensioners ain't a lifetime profession.

130
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,116
Look atcha!

131
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:33,017
You're about as much use,
as an ashtray on a motorbike!

132
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,849
Leave 'em alone, Ray!

133
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:38,450
They're doing the best they can.
Aren't you, boys?

134
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:39,591
Yes, Doreen.

135
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:44,632
Um, I was wondering,
my window, the catch keeps slipping,

136
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:48,299
and I was wondering if one of you
big, strong boys could come and...

137
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,841
ooh... force it open?

138
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,666
I think Andy is big and strong.

139
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:55,517
He's up for fixing a window,
aren't you, Andy?

140
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,299
Oh, Andy.
Dunno what I'd do without'cha?

141
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:01,949
Oh... See you later.

142
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,257
See you later, Doreen.
Say "bye", Andy.

143
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,257
Bye, Doreen.

144
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:08,424
- Yeah, mate, mate,
- Mate, mate, mate...

145
00:11:08,425 --> 00:11:10,591
You're gonna get lucky today,
I tell you what.

146
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:13,274
Bit of experience might that be,
so go on in.

147
00:11:13,383 --> 00:11:16,224
Every time.
Every fucking time.

148
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:23,549
I know you're gonna be knocking
this place down in a few weeks time,

149
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,049
but do you feel the need to rub it in?

150
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,191
There's people here
about to have their dinner.

151
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:30,192
You yuppie twat!

152
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,382
Look, I really need to get
these measurements, okay?

153
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:36,007
If you don't sling your
hook in 5 seconds time,

154
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,907
I'm gonna ram that fucking
clipboard so far up your "Aries",

155
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:41,824
you're gonna have to shove your
pen up your nose to write on it!

156
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,841
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
- All right... All right! All right!

157
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,841
There you go.

158
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,382
All right, Ray?
Is it okay if I sit with you?

159
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,299
You sit where you like, sweetheart.

160
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:04,891
So, where they sending you
when this place closes?

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,416
Oh, some place up north.
Bradford, I suppose.

162
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:10,591
Somewhere full of northern monkeys.

163
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,341
- It's nice up north.
- I wouldn't know.

164
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:16,781
I've never been further north
than Walthamstow dog track,

165
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,341
and that's far enough for me.

166
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:19,841
Do you want this one,
or do you want that one?

167
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,632
Oh, you take that one.
You help yourself.

168
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,091
Are you going to the concert today?

169
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,366
What else am I gonna do
while I'm in here?

170
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,949
Sit around, waiting
for the Grim Reaper to come, and...

171
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:32,006
put us all out of our misery?

172
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:34,257
Got any fillet steak?

173
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:35,507
Just what you see, mate.

174
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,799
Mate? Are you being disrespectful, son?

175
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,674
No, Darryl.

176
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,091
Mr. Cooper is what you call me.

177
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:45,466
You want to be careful what you say,
I could have you killed.

178
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:49,424
All your gangster mates are dead.
How're you gonna get someone killed?

179
00:12:49,558 --> 00:12:51,382
Advertise in 'Exchange and Mart'?

180
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:55,132
I could have you done and all.
I know people, I do.

181
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:56,866
But go on, hurry up!

182
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:59,187
Me stomach thinks
me "apples and pears" been cut.

183
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,591
Your stairs have been cut?

184
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:02,257
No, me "apples and pears"; me throat.

185
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:03,716
"Apples and pears" means stairs.

186
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:06,007
Take no notice of him,
he gets everything boxed up.

187
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:08,799
"Apples and pears"; cares.
"Cares and woes"; nose.

188
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,757
"Nose in me boat"; throat.

189
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:11,966
Don't you talk English?

190
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,091
Makes sense to me, Eric.
There you are.

191
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:28,091
They don't get better than that ever.

192
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,924
Lunch, Hamish.

193
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:34,257
- Come on!
- Oh, all right.

194
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,924
I'd rather have a nap...

195
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:43,174
- with you.
- Oi! You cheeky bugger.

196
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,116
Yeah, I wouldn't worry.

197
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:51,299
They're gonna tear the place down
in a couple of weeks.

198
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:54,716
Yeah. Okay.
Speak to them. Bye.

199
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,382
Do you really think we can do this?

200
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,549
Ain't got a choice, mate.
I mean, look at this idiot.

201
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,599
If we don't do anything, this guy is
gonna knock down granddad's care home.

202
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,132
What would mum and dad have done?

203
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:20,466
Life's gonna throw a lot at you,
'cause of who you are, where you're from.

204
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:23,924
See, some people don't respect us,
the working class.

205
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:28,382
But don't you dare, ever,
let anyone put you down, all right?

206
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:31,341
You can be anything you want,

207
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:35,287
long as you work hard,
stick together as a family,

208
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,266
and always stand up
for what's right, yeah?

209
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,899
Now, look,
we've gotta pop out for a minute,

210
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,099
so you two behave yourselves, all right?

211
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:46,466
Here you go.

212
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:54,507
- You ready, Shirl?
- Ready.

213
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:59,924
Come on, you fucking pigs!

214
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:02,341
Come on! You'll never take us alive!

215
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:06,057
Probably not the best role models
for the current situation, Andrew.

216
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,799
I think they'd be all right with it.

217
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:17,216
<i>An East London building site
has been shut down,</i>

218
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,216
<i>after several workers were injured,
earlier today.</i>

219
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:23,132
<i>Police have not revealed
the details of the accident,</i>

220
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:25,174
<i>but a Department of
Health spokesperson...</i>

221
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,466
Right, let's get the van
and pick up the others.

222
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:32,091
I think maybe we should have picked
something easier than a bank.

223
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:35,091
Nah, we'll be fine.
Davey will look after us.

224
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:54,924
You getting in, then?

225
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:56,882
Yeah, yeah, just keeping a low profile.

226
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,299
We ain't done anything yet, mate.

227
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,966
Yeah, well, it's just,
tricks of the trade and all that.

228
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,841
All right, now, my guy on the inside,

229
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:13,124
he said that they were
upgrading their security.

230
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,175
So, today, there's no security shots.

231
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:17,676
But the alarms are on
and they are working.

232
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:19,382
Did you get the outfits?

233
00:16:19,383 --> 00:16:20,882
Yeah, I blagged them
from the building site.

234
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:21,716
Sweet.

235
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:32,757
You're late, as usual.

236
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,132
Yeah, nice to see you too.

237
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,424
- All right, Kate?
- Katy, not Kate, Katy.

238
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:38,024
All right,
keep your "Alans" (knickers) on.

239
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:40,033
Excuse me for expecting
someone in my own family

240
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:42,034
to remember my fucking name.

241
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:43,035
Christ.

242
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,716
- They let you out then?
- Yeah.

243
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,717
Lost your virginity yet?

244
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,799
Davey Tuppence?
Are you having a laugh?

245
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,757
He's our expert.

246
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:58,466
Expert?
What sort of an expert gets caught?

247
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:01,716
Now, you've got to be really tough
to do this sort of work.

248
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:04,174
- Really?
- Yeah, double tough.

249
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:07,632
Do you, uh, wanna see some of my scars?

250
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,007
- Yeah, yeah, I'd love to.
- Of course you do, babe.

251
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:12,174
Oh, bollocks.

252
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,932
It's the best we could do
at short notice, all right?

253
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,946
You said, it'd just be the three of us.
In and out, no complications.

254
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:19,382
Yes, no complications.

255
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:22,007
But we need as much help as possible
to make sure things go smoothly.

256
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,507
That's why I'm here.

257
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,041
- Which one is Mickey's?
- Mental Mickey?

258
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,299
Oh, this just gets better and better.

259
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:35,399
He's the only person that we knew
that had access to guns, all right?

260
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:38,257
You said no shooting.
We can't afford to get caught with guns.

261
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,724
They're just for show. All right?

262
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:43,362
He's not mental.

263
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:47,663
He's just got a few...
anger management issues, that's all.

264
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:49,749
Issues? He's a fucking psycho!

265
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:53,216
I heard he pulled a geezer's spine out
and wore it as a belt.

266
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,841
Great, I feel much better now.

267
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:04,716
All right, mate.

268
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,299
Here he comes.

269
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,049
Oi! Princess, move.

270
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:25,591
See you brought me a bird, then?

271
00:18:25,592 --> 00:18:27,924
Who the fuck are you calling a bird,
you prick?

272
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:30,299
Fuck are you calling a prick,
you shitter?

273
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:35,007
- Whoa! Easy... easy...
- Katy is our cousin. She's a locksmith.

274
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:38,049
And this is Davey Tuppence.

275
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:40,334
- Yeah, I've heard of him.
- Got a bit of a reputation, don't I?

276
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:42,491
I heard you're a bit of a muppet, bruv.

277
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,674
It's a good job
I'm sorting out the shooters, eh?

278
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:49,975
Be a "pinion" (?)
and try and ease.

279
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:53,007
Ah, beautiful.

280
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,341
Now this... is my baby.

281
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:59,924
It's a Remington 870 Express
12-gauge pump-action shotgun...

282
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:01,674
with a tactical pistol grip.

283
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:04,466
Takes eight 3-inch magnum shells.

284
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:06,841
Her name's Tracy.

285
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,257
She's pretty.

286
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,299
Fucking hell.

287
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,757
Now, let's go fuck up
some fuckers, yeah?

288
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:56,257
Ooh, there's something funny
going on at the building site.

289
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:01,407
Katy, don't look at me like that,
for fuck's sake.

290
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,532
Yes, I should have told you
about the guns, all right?

291
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,699
But I can drop you off, if you want.

292
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,949
No chance. I ain't leaving you two
alone with these divs.

293
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,949
Someone's got to keep you alive.

294
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,032
Shit!

295
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,816
Rats.

296
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:19,157
Lots of rats.

297
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,607
I wonder where they're going.

298
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,132
Down to the pub for a pint.

299
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,149
Who gives a fuck?
Just drive through 'em, Ter.

300
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,659
Mate, they're just gonna
clog up the wheels.

301
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,669
There's no point,
we've got plenty of time, all right?

302
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,907
Now listen,
you all know what you're doing, yeah?

303
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:31,957
- Yeah.
- Right, perfect.

304
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:34,116
Now listen to this.
This is the most important part, Mickey.

305
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:35,832
No shooting.

306
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,066
If it takes longer than 3 minutes,
then we just get out of there.

307
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:41,216
- Shouldn't we be wearing disguises?
- Ha ha, sorted it...right.

308
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,141
- What's that?
- Well, it's a moustache.

309
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,907
I can see it's a fucking moustache.
Are you expecting me to wear one?

310
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,074
Well, why not?

311
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:54,657
Put your glasses on, pull your hat down.
No one will know the difference.

312
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,366
I've got tits, you teat!

313
00:20:56,592 --> 00:21:01,224
Well, in fairness,
they're not...that big,

314
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,825
so you'll probably be all right.

315
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,116
Last chance to call it off.

316
00:21:33,817 --> 00:21:35,166
Nah, come on, let's go.

317
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:46,616
Now, when we get in there,
I'll make the announcement, right?

318
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:49,166
And then, you'll make as much
fucking noise as possible, you know.

319
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:52,566
- Really put a frightness on 'em.
- Yeah, that's music to my ears, Tuppence.

320
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:53,949
Come on.

321
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:58,532
You need your own deposit slips.
It's bank policy.

322
00:21:58,547 --> 00:22:02,241
Look, I just... You know me.
You know my account.

323
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:04,074
Why are you making this difficult, Clive?

324
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:05,949
I wish I could help,
but my hands are tied.

325
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,491
I suggest you go back to your...
bedsit, rifle through your drawers...

326
00:22:10,492 --> 00:22:12,241
How dare you? How dare you?

327
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:14,391
Come on, Davey, say something.

328
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:17,449
- Let's just fucking shoot everyone.
- Let's start with you, eh?

329
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:22,282
Are you here for the money, then?

330
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,816
Yes, we are here about the money, um...

331
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:28,066
And we don't want any
trouble, all right?

332
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,024
Oh, no, no, it's no trouble at all.
I assure you.

333
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:32,399
Would you like to come this way?

334
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:37,699
- What's going on?
- I have no fucking idea.

335
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:47,532
I wasn't expecting so many of you,
but, um, a couple of you can sit down.

336
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,324
Now, if I could just see your forms,
we can get you that money.

337
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:56,366
- Forms?
- The C114 and the 27B/6.

338
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:02,491
You are from Heartman Construction,
aren't you?

339
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,782
Yep.

340
00:23:05,193 --> 00:23:08,032
Right, it's just that Eddie
said you'd have the forms.

341
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,282
He said he'd bring them later...

342
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:13,574
Okay, well, I can't release
the money without the forms.

343
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,657
All right, stop the Lilly Law, will ya?

344
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:17,616
We ain't got your
fucking forms, all right?

345
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:21,407
But, I've got this, you soppy bitch.
Now, where's the fucking money?

346
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:23,532
I'll give you the money,
just please don't hurt me.

347
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,866
- Get up!
- Not you, Davey.

348
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,324
Look for about ten grey security bags,

349
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:33,474
should be a couple of hundred
grand in there easy.

350
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:40,532
Move.

351
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,574
Right, so,
if we take two bags each, then, uh...

352
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,236
- What's all of this?
- Two and a half million.

353
00:24:07,543 --> 00:24:10,782
All of Heartman Construction's
payroll and profit.

354
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:12,657
Fuck me.

355
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,358
Granddad's gonna kill us.

356
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:17,991
It's too much.
Old Bill will never stop chasing us.

357
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:18,649
Too much?

358
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:21,050
You having a fucking "giraffe" (laugh)?
We can retire on this.

359
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:22,707
Retire?
You don't even have a fucking job.

360
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:24,116
This is my fucking job!

361
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,657
I mean... we're here, you know,
might as well take it.

362
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,274
Let's do it.

363
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:34,866
Andy.

364
00:24:58,367 --> 00:24:59,199
Jesus!

365
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,741
We're gonna go down in history.
Easiest armed robbery ever.

366
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,699
<i>Drop your weapons,
and get down on the ground!</i>

367
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:10,924
<i>On the ground! Now!</i>

368
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:19,491
Come on, you fucking slags!

369
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:21,707
Get down!

370
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:33,282
Stop shooting, Mickey!

371
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:37,574
They were gonna fucking nick us, right!
We ain't got time for a pussy fallback!

372
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,861
Can't we just say, it was a mistake and
we didn't mean it. No hard feelings.

373
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:42,032
Well, it doesn't fucking work like that,
does it, Andy?

374
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,199
Ain't there a back door?

375
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,399
Shit, we're trapped.

376
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,699
No, we ain't marked off yet.

377
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:52,282
- Everybody, get down! This is a robbery!
- Everybody, get down! This is a robbery!

378
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:53,032
Shut up!

379
00:25:53,075 --> 00:25:56,641
Fill up them security bags,
before I blow your fucking head off!

380
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:58,999
You want more? There's two and
a half million quid outside!

381
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,199
These are easier to carry.
We gotta run now!

382
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:02,699
- Ter.
- What? Mickey! What?

383
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:04,466
I'm gonna get us out of here!

384
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:06,866
Fucking hell, mate!
I don't fucking think so!

385
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:08,616
You lost your fucking marbles?
Give that back!

386
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:10,616
Fuck off, mate! You let this off,
we're all fucking dead!

387
00:26:10,623 --> 00:26:12,815
Just back off
and let me think for a second!

388
00:26:12,817 --> 00:26:15,866
<i>Come out with your hands on your head,
and you won't be harmed!</i>

389
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,199
Suck my fucking chocolate stick!

390
00:26:49,383 --> 00:26:51,157
Fucking hell!

391
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:53,991
Are you all right?
Oh, my God!

392
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:55,241
What's going on?

393
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,491
Everybody out the front door!
Everybody out!

394
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:02,866
What are you doing?

395
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:06,574
Outside! Outside!

396
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:10,199
Have some of this, twinkle toes.

397
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,824
Peggy! Peggy!
Come on!

398
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,074
Tuppence, you're the expert,
go and have a look.

399
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:29,116
I'm not looking. You look.

400
00:27:29,158 --> 00:27:30,907
- Andy, go and have a look.
- What?

401
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:32,716
I can't see through this glass, mate.

402
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:37,532
Out of the way, wankers, move.
I'll sort this out.

403
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,657
Ow! Ow!
Get off me, you big dickbag!

404
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:42,657
Don't try any funny shit.

405
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:44,616
What the fuck are you doing?
We're not taking any hostages!

406
00:27:44,617 --> 00:27:45,449
No, it's a bad idea.

407
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:46,657
Maybe you ain't,

408
00:27:46,992 --> 00:27:50,616
but I am. Up!

409
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,741
I'm no use as a hostage.
I have a heart condition.

410
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,457
I can drop dead if I get stressed.

411
00:27:54,575 --> 00:27:56,407
Stay calm then, you muppet.

412
00:27:58,117 --> 00:28:01,949
Right! We're coming out!
And we've got hostages! Move!

413
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,199
Might as well follow him now.

414
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,032
- 1...2...3...
- Wait.

415
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:12,833
..4!

416
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,741
And that can fuck right off!

417
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,199
- Mickey!
- What's going on?

418
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:47,857
- Zombies.
- Are you sure?

419
00:28:52,408 --> 00:28:53,824
Pretty sure.

420
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,157
He's eating a foot!

421
00:28:58,233 --> 00:28:59,866
It's fucking disgusting.

422
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:04,282
Fuck this. All right, grab the money.
Grab the money!

423
00:29:08,283 --> 00:29:10,366
All right, let's get into the van!

424
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:17,782
Andy, come on, hurry up!
Put the bags in the back!

425
00:29:22,575 --> 00:29:23,324
Come on.

426
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:26,824
Please! Don't leave me
here with these things!

427
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:28,349
Andy, get in the van!

428
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,246
Andy, get in here!

429
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:34,191
What're you doing?
Jesus fucking Christ!

430
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:36,241
Well, I couldn't just leave her,
could I?

431
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,324
- Drive!
- I can't start the fucking van!

432
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:42,599
Unbelievable.

433
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:05,157
How are you?

434
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,074
She's dead!

435
00:30:08,825 --> 00:30:10,199
What's going on?
What's going on?

436
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,699
- She's dead!
- Fucking get rid of her then!

437
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:16,616
Hands off me, you mental bitch!

438
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,157
Mental, do something!

439
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:31,116
Say hello to Tracy, you shitbag!

440
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:36,657
Yes!

441
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:39,532
Sorry, Terry, I put her in.
That's my bad.

442
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:41,991
Mickey, don't ever fire
that gun indoors again!

443
00:30:41,992 --> 00:30:46,157
You see that, Tuppence? Told you, mate!
Nobody messes with my Tracy.

444
00:30:49,525 --> 00:30:51,449
What the fuck was that?

445
00:30:52,075 --> 00:30:54,999
Why didn't you check to make sure
they didn't put a dye pack in?

446
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:55,991
What's a dye pack?

447
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:58,199
The thing that just exploded.
That's a dye pack!

448
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:00,449
Calm down! We'll be there in a minute!

449
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:14,949
Let's lock the bleeding doors!

450
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,741
Where do we go now? Upstairs?

451
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:20,324
- No, we'll be fucked, up there! Um...
- Oh... Where?

452
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:22,449
- Back door!
- Back door, right.

453
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:26,116
Come on, let's go.

454
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:45,949
We can't go that way either.

455
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,157
Peggy, kick it.

456
00:31:56,325 --> 00:31:58,407
The bastards are everywhere.

457
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:03,449
Eric, shut that door!
Darryl, drum those shut!

458
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,032
Doreen, lock that back door!
Close everything!

459
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,782
All right, Tuppence, here you go.
Close the gate. Go on, son.

460
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:32,741
All right, Andy, Katy, grab the bags!
You two muppets, in there!

461
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:39,824
Aah! I've got a gun.

462
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:43,324
A little slow.

463
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,116
Is that as fast as they go?

464
00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:49,574
I thought they ran really quick.

465
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:52,849
Mate, they're dead. They're not
exactly gonna sprint, are they?

466
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,699
Fine, come on then, you fucking muppet!

467
00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:04,574
Oh yeah, hard guy, are ya?
Have some of this then, you prick!

468
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,449
That's how you do it.

469
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,532
Owww! He fucking bit me!

470
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:17,949
You've gotta get them in the head.

471
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,657
Shut up. How'd you even know that?

472
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:21,157
Everyone knows that.

473
00:33:25,117 --> 00:33:25,907
Come here.

474
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:41,157
Is that even actually possible?

475
00:33:42,325 --> 00:33:43,816
You'll pull my fucking skin off.

476
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:45,824
Can't exactly leave it there, can ya?

477
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:49,699
- Oh...
- What? Whoa, there's another one!

478
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,407
What the fuck?

479
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:08,366
- Oh!
- Oh, rot!

480
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:13,366
Come here, little fella.

481
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:14,657
Easy, mate, come on.

482
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:17,532
Is it all right? Awww...

483
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:22,699
Oi! You little shit.

484
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:30,657
No, too much!
Too fucking much in one day, surely!

485
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:33,074
Never liked kids anyway.

486
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:37,241
Okay, get in!

487
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,616
Right, Andy, Tuppence,
put the bags there and there!

488
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:43,449
Katy! Get on the phone and try
and get a hold of anyone, all right?

489
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:45,391
- Get in the chair!
- Sit down.

490
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:46,481
Don't move.

491
00:34:47,575 --> 00:34:49,574
Mickey, you all right, mate?
Your arm looks a little bit dodgy.

492
00:34:49,617 --> 00:34:51,616
Yeah, bruv.
Fucking good as gold, bruv.

493
00:34:52,408 --> 00:34:55,282
So, no shooting and no hostages.
Job well done, boys.

494
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:58,949
Don't blame me trickle, yeah?
The pigs come! I improvised!

495
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,532
- Thank fuck you're here, eh?
- Easy.

496
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:01,574
- Fuck you.
- Relax.

497
00:35:02,658 --> 00:35:04,866
So... shall we jump in the car
and head off then?

498
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:07,582
No, no, no, we can't just go running off
until we know exactly what's happened,

499
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:09,699
all right?
This...wasn't exactly part of the plan.

500
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,449
Nothing... shit reception.
Worse than New Year's eve.

501
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,824
- Shit!
- Have you tried the radio?

502
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:19,366
- What?
- The radio.

503
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:21,157
We ain't got a radio.

504
00:35:22,408 --> 00:35:24,407
Yeah, you have a radio in the van.

505
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,324
No, she's right.
You was listening to Dido.

506
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:31,032
Yeah, all right,
I'll go check it out, um...

507
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:32,491
- I'll come with ya.
- Yeah.

508
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,782
You, keep an eye on them.
Watch Mr. Bean, all right?

509
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,241
Mental's been bitten.
He's gonna turn into one of those things.

510
00:35:52,242 --> 00:35:53,366
Yeah, he's still alive though.

511
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,732
Doesn't matter.
His arm's going grey. He's gonna turn.

512
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:56,866
He's a fucking liability.

513
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:58,741
- What're you saying?
- He needs to be shot.

514
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,532
Fucking hell, Katy!
You're a bit eager to shoot people.

515
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:02,699
Look, I don't want to shoot people,

516
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,324
but I'll happily shoot
somebody who's already dead.

517
00:36:04,325 --> 00:36:05,407
He's not fucking dead!

518
00:36:05,408 --> 00:36:07,616
Fine! Don't say I didn't
warn you when he turns.

519
00:36:09,242 --> 00:36:11,691
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

520
00:36:11,692 --> 00:36:15,116
<i>There is a viral infection concentrated
on the East End of London,</i>

521
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:16,949
<i>and spreading fast through the capital.</i>

522
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,449
<i>The army have sealed off the East End
to try and contain the virus...</i>

523
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:25,782
- What are you up to later?
- What?

524
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,907
Well, you fancy maybe coming
to get a drink with me or something.

525
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:33,241
Are you out of your mind?
You just kidnapped me.

526
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:35,991
You've threatened me with guns.
You've put me in danger.

527
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:37,457
Yeah, sorry about that.

528
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:39,658
I mean some girls
are into that sort of thing.

529
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:44,532
Not you, obviously.
Uh, I just mean...

530
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:46,141
- Some girls.
- No!

531
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:49,241
- Davey, probably not.
- Sorry.

532
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:00,749
Cheers, mate.

533
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,866
I'm keeping track of all this,
so I can write a report for the police.

534
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:06,141
I'm memorising your faces.

535
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,866
Put a sock in it, you little cretin!

536
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,407
Hey, I'm doing this
for your benefit too, you know?

537
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:11,949
Why don't we just let them go.

538
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,282
Shut it, Davey!

539
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:17,899
Davey, is that your name? Right.
I made a note of that.

540
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:19,699
Oh, great. Thanks, Mickey.

541
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,824
Mickey. Right. Another name.

542
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,807
You're remembering everything, are ya?

543
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,491
Yes, every tiny detail.

544
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,949
Well, don't forget this then.
Keep your fucking airhole shut!

545
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,991
- Well, what is it?
- Yeah, zombies.

546
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:40,866
Shitloads of 'em.

547
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:42,616
Yeah, some kind of
mutated virus or something.

548
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,907
I don't know when it started,
but it's spreading fast.

549
00:37:44,908 --> 00:37:47,366
Maybe... it's something in the water.

550
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:50,074
- Christ, Andy!
- It's not fucking water.

551
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:52,449
They're gonna seal off the East End
to see if they can contain it.

552
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,949
Told everyone to just stay indoors.

553
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:55,949
Yes, and whatever you do, do not
let 'em fucking bite you, all right?

554
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,866
'Cause that's where it starts.

555
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:02,782
We've got a problem.

556
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:05,574
We've come this far 'cause we've got
guns and we're strong, all right?

557
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,949
But what about granddad?

558
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,949
He can handle anything.
He was in the war.

559
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,107
I know that, mate. But I think
this is a little bit different.

560
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:14,108
You know what i mean?

561
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,366
I think... I think even granddad's
gonna have a tough time with this one.

562
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:19,666
We have to go there.Keep him safe
till all of this gets sorted.

563
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,116
Yep.

564
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:25,157
Okay, they can't get in.
But, we can't get out.

565
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:28,282
Now, we're just gonna have to stay here,
until we think of sumthin'.

566
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:30,699
Or the bowzers just bash
the bloody doors down.

567
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:33,866
Don't say that.
We'll work something out.

568
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,866
Look, what the bloody hell are they?

569
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:37,991
It's obvious, innit?
They're vampires!

570
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:41,407
Then what we need is crucifixes, silver,

571
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,616
garlic, holy water, and Chrisopher Lee.

572
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,674
Oh, shut up, you soppy tart.

573
00:38:46,676 --> 00:38:49,675
Those things out there...
are fucking zombies!

574
00:39:01,975 --> 00:39:04,491
It's probably not as bad as it looks.

575
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:07,657
I think it probably is, mate.

576
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:14,824
We are going to be all right,
aren't we, Ray?

577
00:39:14,908 --> 00:39:16,324
Yeah, of course we are, sweetheart.

578
00:39:16,408 --> 00:39:21,824
Listen. If one of 'em bites me,
you will sort me out, won't you?

579
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:25,157
Yeah, I'll promise, really.
But, uh... it won't come to that.

580
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:27,116
Thanks, Ray.

581
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:31,241
Same goes for me.
If one of them fuckers bites me...

582
00:39:32,283 --> 00:39:33,616
you finish me off.

583
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:37,082
You joking?
I'll kill you stone fucking dead.

584
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,074
Eh?

585
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:42,366
We're in enough trouble without
you turning into one of them as well.

586
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:44,616
Yeah.

587
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:54,157
Don't worry about it.
Just a little scratch.

588
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:57,032
Won't kill me, bruv.

589
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,157
Honestly, Mickey.
Maybe you need to get to a hospital.

590
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:02,991
Maybe you should shut
your fucking mouth. How about that?

591
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,691
Please, we've done everything
you asked us.

592
00:40:06,693 --> 00:40:08,492
You don't need us any more.

593
00:40:09,117 --> 00:40:11,199
She's right. We should let them go.

594
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:12,407
Fuck off!

595
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,708
We just "half-inched" (pinched)
2 million quid.

596
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,449
As soon as we let them go,
they'll snitch on us.

597
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,324
Oh, no, we won't say a word.

598
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:19,532
I will.
I'll tell 'em everything.

599
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,991
Jesus, Clive! Shut up! Christ!

600
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,949
Fine, just me then.
I won't say a word.

601
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:29,741
Look, the world
is clearly going to shit.

602
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:32,532
Do you think I care about
your poxy little robbery?

603
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:37,824
My sister's ill,
I need to check up on her.

604
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:39,616
I don't expect you lot to understand.

605
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:42,074
You clearly don't care about
anything other than yourselves.

606
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:46,407
Why'd you say that for?
Have we said anything nasty to you?

607
00:40:46,742 --> 00:40:47,616
You kidnapped me!

608
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:49,366
Do you know why we're doing this?

609
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,699
No, and I don't care.

610
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:55,441
They're closing down
our granddad's old people's home.

611
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:57,191
He's lived in the East End all his life.

612
00:40:57,233 --> 00:41:00,316
We're doing this so he can
stay here with his friends.

613
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:10,449
I, uh... All I just need
is to clear me debts.

614
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,116
Lost all me rent money on racehorse.

615
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,241
What? I thought we were sharing.

616
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:26,074
I know it's hard to believe. But we've
actually never robbed anything before.

617
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,324
Huh, no shit.

618
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:30,199
When we was young,
our mum and dad died and...

619
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,032
granddad raised us so...
you know... we owe him.

620
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,324
Why didn't you just save up?

621
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:36,116
We did, for six months.

622
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:38,657
And then someone broke into
our flat and nicked it.

623
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:39,691
You think that's funny, do ya?

624
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:40,782
It's pathetic.

625
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:45,532
Sorry to break up
you lot's fucking little orgy.

626
00:41:46,158 --> 00:41:48,657
You're getting too pally
pally for my liking.

627
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,282
You're telling them too much about us.

628
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:56,457
All right, Andy, I want you
to light up the car, all right?

629
00:41:56,669 --> 00:41:58,158
What you doing?

630
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:01,324
- Gimme my keys.
- Nah.

631
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:02,857
Gimme my fucking keys!

632
00:42:02,858 --> 00:42:06,157
Think I'll hang on to these, in case
you try to run off with my money.

633
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:09,032
But it's not
that I don't trust you, Ter.

634
00:42:09,733 --> 00:42:12,282
It's that I don't fucking trust you.

635
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,107
Yeah, think I'mma shove 'em over there.

636
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:19,774
Don't make us go with him.

637
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,649
- Get up now!
- I'm up, I'm up.

638
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,282
- Guys, come on.
- Move!

639
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,024
- Moving.
- Take it easy.

640
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:31,816
You can't just let him take 'em.

641
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:34,941
What the fuck are we gonna do?

642
00:42:34,942 --> 00:42:36,407
He ain't got much longer,
you know that, right?

643
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:38,357
He's fucking lost his mind,
he's gonna kill someone.

644
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:40,907
So what are we gonna do?
He's gonna turn any minute, right?

645
00:42:46,442 --> 00:42:47,899
Wait.

646
00:42:49,825 --> 00:42:51,024
In there.

647
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,491
Fucking mag mug!

648
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,741
- Now, get in.
- Yup, okay.

649
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:35,616
You should be safe in there now...
probably...

650
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:42,199
I can't believe they got Hamish.
He's only 83.

651
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,574
Oh, I'm so glad I didn't see it.

652
00:43:44,575 --> 00:43:47,491
Did anyone actually see Hamish
in the room when it happened?

653
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:51,699
He went out in the garden to have a kip,
but I never saw him come back in.

654
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,032
Fuck!
He must have slept right through it.

655
00:44:07,242 --> 00:44:08,874
There're zombies everywhere.

656
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,532
Yeah, but they ain't bite him yet.

657
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:14,491
Hamish! Wake up!

658
00:44:15,742 --> 00:44:17,741
Wake up! You silly old fucker!

659
00:44:25,283 --> 00:44:27,157
What are you all doing in there?

660
00:44:27,325 --> 00:44:29,241
Don't talk, they'll hear you.

661
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:32,866
I'm sorry, I... I can't hear.
You'll have to speak up!

662
00:44:33,242 --> 00:44:34,241
Shut up!

663
00:44:34,743 --> 00:44:37,642
Come to the back door.
We'll let you in.

664
00:44:38,325 --> 00:44:40,407
Pardon?

665
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:44,591
There're zombies everywhere.

666
00:44:44,593 --> 00:44:47,592
Come to the back door,
and we'll let you in.

667
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:49,491
Run! Now!

668
00:44:49,492 --> 00:44:51,491
Oh, it doesnt' work.
I can't hear you.

669
00:44:51,492 --> 00:44:55,782
You'll have to... hold on.
I'll... I'll come over there.

670
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:02,324
He's Mutt'n'Jeff,
deaf as a fucking post!

671
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,407
He'd move a bit quicker
if it was dinner time.

672
00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:11,032
Hamish, there's a zombie
right behind you! Move! Right now!

673
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:14,991
Zombie, eh? Zombie?
What are you going on about?

674
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:18,199
Oh, my, oh.
Oh, it's a zombie, oh.

675
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,657
RUUUUUN!

676
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,616
Why're you going so fast? Ey-oh!

677
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:33,949
Fuck!

678
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:44,157
Zombies, oh, no, oh, oh, oh, eh, eh.

679
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,532
You don't look very well.

680
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:23,699
- Me?
- No, Clive. Him.

681
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,491
Why don't I come over there
and untie you.

682
00:46:28,492 --> 00:46:30,907
I'll show you how fucking well I am.

683
00:46:34,783 --> 00:46:35,741
Look, I'm serious, um...

684
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:40,916
Why don't you untie us, and...
and we'll take you to a hospital, huh?

685
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,124
Ain't going nowhere.

686
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:48,532
I said I'm fine.

687
00:47:09,925 --> 00:47:12,074
Get out of it!

688
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:20,574
He's not gonna make it.

689
00:47:20,617 --> 00:47:22,991
We've got to help him, somehow.

690
00:47:26,408 --> 00:47:28,907
Sumthin''s gotta be done!
I'm gonna go and get him!

691
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,491
Eric, gonna have to
borrow your wheels, mate.

692
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,657
Oh, be careful! You're gonna break
me "trouble-and-strife" (wife)!

693
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,741
Shall I come with you?

694
00:47:35,742 --> 00:47:38,241
Peggy, youse guys keep
the back door clear.

695
00:47:38,243 --> 00:47:40,042
I'll bring him back in.

696
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:42,366
Come on, Eric.

697
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:53,532
Take care of this one, Peggy!

698
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,407
Hamish!

699
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:08,866
And you can fuck off and all.

700
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:12,574
Hamish, get in.

701
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:16,566
Bring your frame with ya.

702
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:13,707
- Yeah, I'll cover you from here.
- Come with me, mate.

703
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,224
- I'll cover you from here.
- Andy?

704
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:22,691
- Take your time, mate.
- Sorry, mate.

705
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:24,316
I've been waiting for bloody...

706
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:25,866
Fuck! Get off! Get off!

707
00:49:26,399 --> 00:49:27,791
Here, I'll shoot it!
I'll shoot it!

708
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:30,366
Terry! Quick!

709
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,824
You all right, mate?
Did he bite ya?

710
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:50,199
- No, mate.
- Yeah?

711
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,400
It's sweet.

712
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,241
All right, let's close this.

713
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,574
Oh, great, another one.

714
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:02,907
Fucking hell, that is mingin'.

715
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:03,699
Use your gun.

716
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,524
Nah, I'm gonna dig a garden
in it's face.

717
00:50:05,527 --> 00:50:07,282
Might be it's better to shoot it.

718
00:50:07,283 --> 00:50:08,324
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

719
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:14,582
How'd you fucking turn it on?

720
00:50:14,593 --> 00:50:15,532
Safety catch!

721
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:18,449
- Where?
- Oh, for fuck's sake, there!

722
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,074
- Otherwise it ain't gonna work.
- Thanks.

723
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:25,907
Can you get free, Clive?

724
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,866
- No, it's too tight.
- Oh, great.

725
00:50:29,533 --> 00:50:31,199
Hang on, I can get loose.

726
00:50:31,242 --> 00:50:34,032
Oh, oh, great,
let me see, let me see.

727
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:35,907
- I'm doing a knot.
- Twizzle, twizzle.

728
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,324
Let me have a look. Let me have a look.

729
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,832
- Oh, that's it, that's it.
- Chew the knot.

730
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:40,824
Oh, okay, let me try and bite it.

731
00:50:40,825 --> 00:50:42,699
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

732
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,157
- Okay, a little bit to the left.
- Yeah.

733
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:47,699
Oh... you can do it.
You can do...

734
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:57,532
Oh, shit! He's turned! Oh, shit!

735
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:06,366
Uh... Clive...

736
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,282
- Help us! For God's sake!
- Help!

737
00:51:13,667 --> 00:51:15,324
Oh, fuck.
The hostages.

738
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:16,506
Quick! Get back in here!

739
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:18,032
We're tied up, you fucking idiots!

740
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,466
Right, in that case,
Tuppence, block that door.

741
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,467
You two, come with me.

742
00:51:29,033 --> 00:51:31,949
- Right! Untie 'em!
- He's turned! Shoot him!

743
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,657
Right, you're with me, sunshine!
Come here!

744
00:51:36,817 --> 00:51:37,699
Sit down!

745
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:41,782
- Shoot him!
- I did!

746
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:42,991
Shoot him again then!

747
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,949
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
There's a metal plate in his head!

748
00:51:50,959 --> 00:51:51,907
Well, think of something else!

749
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,241
Grab him! Grab him!

750
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,491
Right, you can have this back, mate!

751
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,699
Go on! Go on!

752
00:52:02,825 --> 00:52:05,032
Sorry, mate.
Go on!

753
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:20,699
- Ter! You all right?
- Yeah.

754
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,449
I blocked the window.
They can't get through.

755
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:24,366
Great.

756
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,116
Oh, bollocks!

757
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,532
Get back! Put your hands up!

758
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:30,157
Oh, leave it out, mate.

759
00:52:30,158 --> 00:52:34,074
Shut up! I'm in charge now.
And we're all going to the police.

760
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:37,366
Don't be stupid.
We've got bigger problems now.

761
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:40,074
I don't care!
They're all going to prison!

762
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:41,907
Mate, you might want to turn around.

763
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,207
There's a couple of zombies
creeping up behind ya.

764
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:48,074
Oh, really?
Do you honestly think I'm that stupid?

765
00:52:48,608 --> 00:52:51,149
Well... yeah.

766
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:56,107
Davey!

767
00:52:56,983 --> 00:52:59,741
Please! Get 'em off me!
I have a heart condition!

768
00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:06,591
Shit!

769
00:53:08,092 --> 00:53:10,274
You're all right, mate.
We'll get you to a hospital.

770
00:53:11,999 --> 00:53:13,782
- This way!
- Clive!

771
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:18,574
I'm fucked up, admit it.

772
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:21,366
No, no, don't be daft.
You're good as gold, mate. Good as gold.

773
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,657
Was it... Was it all right
that way we did the robbery?

774
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,282
Yeah, no, yeah, yeah, no, textbook.

775
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,907
At least... At least, it looks that way.

776
00:53:29,908 --> 00:53:33,466
Yeah, mate. As soon as we get all this
sorted, we'll be down at a pub, mate.

777
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:34,991
We'll be raising.

778
00:53:35,408 --> 00:53:36,282
Davey...

779
00:53:38,742 --> 00:53:39,616
Davey...

780
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:42,366
I'm sorry, Andy.

781
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:46,241
He's gone.

782
00:53:52,325 --> 00:53:54,032
We're going to the old folks' home now.

783
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:55,907
We're gonna save granddad
and his pals, all right?

784
00:53:57,492 --> 00:53:58,907
Sweetheart.

785
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:03,157
Go on, take it. Go on.

786
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:07,999
Now, you can either come with us, or we
can drop you off on the way, all right?

787
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:11,824
Well, my sister's in Marland.
Could you get me there?

788
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:13,491
All right.

789
00:54:14,658 --> 00:54:16,199
Rest in peace, Tuppence.

790
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:22,741
Giddy up.

791
00:54:31,908 --> 00:54:32,907
Piss off!

792
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:38,741
We'll be okay, Ray.
We'll make it.

793
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,641
Yeah, no thanks to me.

794
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:42,742
Look at me, I'm bloody useless.
I can't do anything.

795
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,149
Oh, don't talk bollocks, Ray.

796
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:47,740
You got us here.
You rescued Hamish.

797
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,032
We wouldn't have been here but for you.

798
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:51,699
I didn't rescue Hamish.

799
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:53,940
I just got him stuck in here
with the rest of us.

800
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,366
And now we're surrounded on all sides!

801
00:54:57,825 --> 00:54:59,574
If these fucking things get in...

802
00:54:59,575 --> 00:55:01,741
Then we'll give 'em as good as we get!

803
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,741
I've got the one with the specs.

804
00:55:26,283 --> 00:55:28,699
Hey! No! No! Easy, easy,
take this, take this, all right?

805
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:41,366
- Get in the car!
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

806
00:55:45,117 --> 00:55:47,074
Mental's got the fucking keys! Shit!

807
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,232
I'll go get 'em.

808
00:55:48,233 --> 00:55:50,241
- No, Andy, you don't need to!
- Andy, don't! It's too dangerous!

809
00:55:50,242 --> 00:55:51,407
I'll be fine!

810
00:56:00,242 --> 00:56:02,949
Hello... Uh... Okay...

811
00:56:04,825 --> 00:56:09,407
Eww... Go away... You queer thing.

812
00:56:19,825 --> 00:56:21,907
- You all right?
- Yeah...

813
00:56:54,742 --> 00:56:55,741
What are you doing here?

814
00:56:55,742 --> 00:56:57,616
Saving your arse
as per fucking usual, mate.

815
00:56:57,618 --> 00:56:59,117
What, you think I'm gonna let you die?

816
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,349
Oh, piss off, you muppets!

817
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:02,940
I'll take you all on
and so will my fucking brother!

818
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,991
Fucking stop saying that.
Come on.

819
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:07,491
You better take to save your bullets.

820
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,907
Yeah, but you've already
done a few, mate.

821
00:57:09,908 --> 00:57:11,824
It's not a competition, Andy!

822
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:14,949
You can't just go running
in there on your own, bruv.

823
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,491
Well, it worked out fine, didn't it?

824
00:57:16,617 --> 00:57:17,657
Yeah, this time, eh?

825
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:19,741
- Fuck off.
- Fuck off!

826
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:26,174
Ta-da! We've got the keys.

827
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:27,874
I don't need keys.

828
00:57:27,879 --> 00:57:29,949
That's why you
brought me along, remember?

829
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:34,907
Oi! Get off my car!
It's a 5 series!

830
00:57:43,242 --> 00:57:45,866
What are we gonna do?
They gonna break in.

831
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,116
Well, lets get tawed up,

832
00:57:47,117 --> 00:57:50,241
open the doors and take some
of these bastards down with us!

833
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:52,324
Are you seriously suggesting
that we let 'em all in,

834
00:57:52,325 --> 00:57:56,699
and fight 'em off with a few packs of
corn flakes, and a dodgy egg whisk?

835
00:57:56,825 --> 00:57:58,949
Yeah! And this.

836
00:58:00,075 --> 00:58:03,541
Yeah, but there's only one of them, and
there's a lot of Trafalgars out there!

837
00:58:03,558 --> 00:58:05,657
Eric, Eric, what is a Trafalgar?

838
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,024
Trafalgar is a zombie.
It's rhyming slang innit?

839
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:09,116
How is it?

840
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,699
Well, Trafalgar Square; fox and hare;
hairy Greek; five-day week;

841
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,741
weak and feeble; pins and needles;
needle and stitch; Abercrombie and Fitch

842
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:21,782
Abercrombie... Zombie!

843
00:58:22,492 --> 00:58:24,866
- Innit?
- Oh, Lord.

844
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:27,241
All right, well, how about it?

845
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:30,824
Why don't we go out there and face them?
Go down fighting? What do you think?

846
00:58:31,158 --> 00:58:34,824
But, somebody might come.
Somebody might rescue us.

847
00:58:34,908 --> 00:58:37,199
Nobody cares. We're on our own.

848
00:58:37,242 --> 00:58:40,866
We're old-age pensioners!
We gotta take care of ourselves!

849
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:55,824
Looks like they've already
sealed off the East End.

850
00:58:55,825 --> 00:58:56,657
We'll be fine.

851
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:02,407
They'll sort this out, won't they?
The army?

852
00:59:04,617 --> 00:59:08,782
- Yeah, 'course they will.
- Yeah, maybe.

853
00:59:12,742 --> 00:59:13,574
Maybe.

854
00:59:32,283 --> 00:59:35,741
Wait!
Be careful! Shit!

855
00:59:42,217 --> 00:59:44,949
Everyone's been evacuated
to the Hinzman RAF base.

856
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,657
- So if she's alive, she'll be there.
- Right.

857
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:59,282
- I'll check inside.
- Wait, I'll go with ya.

858
00:59:59,492 --> 01:00:00,949
- Going in?
- Yeah.

859
01:00:07,558 --> 01:00:09,116
Jen.

860
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,991
Maybe she got out okay.

861
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:19,949
Okay.

862
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,324
- You ready?
- Yeah.

863
01:00:26,658 --> 01:00:30,366
Jen. Oh, no.

864
01:00:32,408 --> 01:00:34,199
Look, let me take care of it.

865
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,282
No, no, um,
they might find a cure, sir.

866
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:55,032
Well? Did you find her?

867
01:00:55,033 --> 01:00:57,949
- Uh, no, no, she wasn't, um...
- She, uh, she wasn't there, mate.

868
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:58,991
She wasn't there.

869
01:01:04,867 --> 01:01:06,949
- Fuck!
- What?

870
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,199
Leprechauns! What do you think?

871
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:29,332
I don't believe this.

872
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:31,733
Even when they're zombies,
they can't stand each other.

873
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:38,241
This is just
the weirdest day of my life.

874
01:01:46,358 --> 01:01:47,449
Quick.

875
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:06,074
Hit the road, Ter.

876
01:02:07,275 --> 01:02:08,907
It's pointless.

877
01:02:09,408 --> 01:02:10,574
If they've already taken over this area,

878
01:02:10,585 --> 01:02:12,566
they're bound to have gotten
to the old folks' home by now.

879
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:13,449
You can't give up.

880
01:02:13,451 --> 01:02:15,107
If we're hunky-dory,
so will granddad.

881
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,107
Oh, yeah?

882
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,216
And where is that
gonna happen exactly, Andy?

883
01:02:18,218 --> 01:02:19,797
Lucky fucking Andy world?

884
01:02:19,817 --> 01:02:22,524
Grow up!
This place is going to shit!

885
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,774
Can we just go?

886
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:26,191
I can't do this.

887
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:27,999
Yes, you can.
Of course, you can.

888
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,407
You know, I would've died about
ten times today if it wasn't for you.

889
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:33,032
I'm only lucky 'cause
you're always there to sort me out.

890
01:02:33,075 --> 01:02:35,407
We can do this... together.

891
01:02:35,408 --> 01:02:37,832
Yeah, you... you helped me get to my
sister's house, just like you promised.

892
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:40,416
The least I can do is help
you get to your granddad.

893
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:43,324
I mean, we haven't even got
any bullets left. How...

894
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:46,949
We've gotta pass
Mental's lock-up, don't we?

895
01:02:47,408 --> 01:02:48,491
Yeah, I guess so.

896
01:02:48,692 --> 01:02:50,574
His lock-up, where all his guns are.

897
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,449
Worthing Nora!

898
01:03:11,525 --> 01:03:12,824
Fuck me.

899
01:03:16,367 --> 01:03:17,532
Right.

900
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:23,366
- Right, Ter, tool up!
- What about this?

901
01:03:23,617 --> 01:03:26,199
How about something a little
easier to handle, eh, Andy?

902
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,532
- Fair enough.
- Come on in.

903
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,407
- Put that in.
- Bullets.

904
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:40,657
Slick.

905
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:42,741
Nice.

906
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:46,324
Go! Go! Come on!

907
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,141
Guys... are you sure we've got enough?

908
01:03:52,142 --> 01:03:53,491
Yes, come on.

909
01:03:54,492 --> 01:03:56,032
- Shit!
- What?

910
01:03:56,034 --> 01:03:59,074
The old folks. We're never gonna
fit 'em all in the car! Shit!

911
01:03:59,492 --> 01:04:01,074
We need another van.

912
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,741
- Katy.
- Yeah.

913
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,241
- Can you hot-wire anything?
- 'Course. Why?

914
01:04:25,283 --> 01:04:29,949
Fucking hell! Ha ha ha! Yes! Hah! Wooo!

915
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:42,491
- Why've we stopped?
- There's a red light.

916
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:44,899
There's no other fucking traffic,
you plum.

917
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,857
Just drive!

918
01:04:45,992 --> 01:04:48,282
Just be a rebel for once in your life,
Terrence, please.

919
01:04:48,617 --> 01:04:51,991
Well, for fuck's sake!
Excuse me for obeying highway code!

920
01:04:55,742 --> 01:04:58,282
Get off our bus, you fucking mug!

921
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:04,241
No ticket.

922
01:05:09,567 --> 01:05:11,282
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

923
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:12,449
Yep, all right.

924
01:05:35,825 --> 01:05:37,032
Well, look, they might be all right.

925
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,782
They probably locked themselves
in the basement or sumthin'.

926
01:05:39,783 --> 01:05:41,241
I don't think there is a basement, mate.

927
01:05:41,255 --> 01:05:42,699
We need to make a diversion.

928
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,741
Well, leave that to me.

929
01:05:43,742 --> 01:05:45,449
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Okay.

930
01:05:46,033 --> 01:05:48,366
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- There's loads... There's loads...

931
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:51,757
Now, take this.
If we're longer than ten minutes...

932
01:05:51,758 --> 01:05:53,699
- Then fucking wait longer.
- Will do.

933
01:05:56,825 --> 01:05:59,616
Hey, guys!
Come here, you big losers!

934
01:06:00,158 --> 01:06:02,449
Woo-oo! Come on!

935
01:06:03,908 --> 01:06:05,491
Go, go, go, go!

936
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:10,616
Let's go!

937
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,241
Come on! Over here!

938
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:53,532
There are too many of 'em.
Ain't there a safer way in?

939
01:06:55,033 --> 01:06:55,949
The skylight.

940
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,532
- Yeah, go, go, go!
- Okay.

941
01:07:05,783 --> 01:07:08,491
- I'll do it.
- Right, work your magic, girl.

942
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:10,074
- You see anything?
- No.

943
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:18,157
- Think you got twisted, luv.
- Yeah, fuck off.

944
01:07:20,058 --> 01:07:20,857
Done.

945
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:23,949
Careful.

946
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:28,490
Go fuck yourselves,
you zombie bastards!

947
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,907
Jesus Christ!

948
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,374
Terry, what are you doing here?

949
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:36,824
We came to to save you, then you try
and use my face as a chopping board.

950
01:07:36,825 --> 01:07:39,207
Well, I thought you was
a fucking zombie, didn't I?

951
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,166
Hello, sweetheart.

952
01:07:40,168 --> 01:07:42,367
What, they dragged you along
with them too?

953
01:07:42,369 --> 01:07:43,199
I volunteered.

954
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,199
Yeah, all right.
Let's get reacquainted later.

955
01:07:45,201 --> 01:07:47,600
We need all of youse to climb up here
so we can go down the fire escape.

956
01:07:47,602 --> 01:07:48,366
All right, let's go.

957
01:07:48,367 --> 01:07:50,199
You're having a "tin bath" (laugh),
aintcha?

958
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,332
Eric is a "raspberry ripple" (cripple).

959
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:56,241
Darryl's got his bad leg, and
Hamish is on his third hip replacement.

960
01:07:56,283 --> 01:07:59,907
Okay, is there anyone down there
that has not had a hip replacement?

961
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,282
I ain't. Now come down here,
and we'll talk about it.

962
01:08:08,283 --> 01:08:09,032
All right.

963
01:08:11,742 --> 01:08:15,282
- Oh, Andy! Andy!
- All right, Doreen?

964
01:08:16,867 --> 01:08:18,832
All right, all right.
Where do we go from here?

965
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:19,999
- Out the front door.
- Yep.

966
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,332
Oh, fuck's sake,
we've been saved, everyone.

967
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,624
Laurel and fucking Hardy here
has come to rescue us.

968
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:30,382
You haven't seen out in the home yet.
There's hundreds of zombies out there.

969
01:08:30,383 --> 01:08:32,249
Well, outside we've got
a double-decker bus,

970
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,332
so if we can all get set there,
we're laughing, all right?

971
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:36,740
Yeah, well, we got a knife,
we got a few forks,

972
01:08:36,742 --> 01:08:39,032
and a fucking
"alligator lopper" over there.

973
01:08:39,033 --> 01:08:40,782
And... we got this.

974
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:47,824
Boys, boys, boys.
Now you're talking my language.

975
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,116
Right, who wants this?

976
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:53,241
Uzi 9 millimetre.

977
01:08:54,658 --> 01:08:58,199
Remember, finger off the trigger,
till you're ready to shoot.

978
01:08:58,558 --> 01:09:00,616
- Thank you, thank you very much.
- No problem.

979
01:09:04,242 --> 01:09:05,991
Peggy, would you fancy something
like this? I mean, is it...

980
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:15,207
Wow!

981
01:09:15,218 --> 01:09:16,949
All right, so you know
what to do with this, yeah?

982
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:17,866
Of course I do.

983
01:09:19,492 --> 01:09:22,991
- Sorry.
- Just be fucking careful, will ya?

984
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,907
- Eric!
- Sorry.

985
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:32,991
Et voila, I call her "The Bitch".

986
01:09:35,558 --> 01:09:37,074
- You ready?
- Yep.

987
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:39,449
Let's do this.

988
01:09:43,325 --> 01:09:44,866
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

989
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,741
You gotta shoot them in the head.

990
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,157
- We know where to fucking shoot 'em!
- All right.

991
01:10:31,367 --> 01:10:32,741
That was it?

992
01:10:41,075 --> 01:10:44,532
Oh, well d... Marvellous!

993
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:58,449
Darryl, where're you going?
What're you doing? Come on.

994
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,949
Ey! Ey, look!

995
01:11:08,915 --> 01:11:10,949
Wrong leg, silly bullets.

996
01:11:17,942 --> 01:11:20,607
Bastard!
Had enough, have ya?

997
01:11:21,108 --> 01:11:23,199
Yeah, well, I think he's dead.
Come on.

998
01:11:23,275 --> 01:11:26,324
- Could I put me leg on?
- All right.

999
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,282
Hello, Natasha.

1000
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:47,241
Sorry, lover.
I don't really fancy you anymore.

1001
01:11:54,508 --> 01:11:56,741
- That was really sad.
- Yeah.

1002
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:20,366
Push me, somebody.
This bastard is mine.

1003
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:22,699
I've got your back, bro!

1004
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,116
Eat lead, zombie!

1005
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,357
Come on.

1006
01:12:38,117 --> 01:12:40,782
"Gordon Bennett" (God blind me)!
There's tons of the bastards.

1007
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,991
- Yes! Yes!
- I'm coming!

1008
01:12:52,992 --> 01:12:54,032
Now, you're gonna get it!

1009
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,699
Come on, you can do it, boy.

1010
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,657
Your time has come, mister.
Yeah!

1011
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:12,074
Come on, Doreen.
Get in.

1012
01:13:14,492 --> 01:13:16,324
Bugger, this is... unbelievable!

1013
01:13:17,183 --> 01:13:18,116
Here we go, Hamish.

1014
01:13:20,617 --> 01:13:23,032
Go! Go! Go!
Get in the bus! Get in the bus!

1015
01:13:31,617 --> 01:13:35,191
Andy, do we need all these bags?
What, are these guns too?

1016
01:13:37,142 --> 01:13:40,666
- Hello. Are you a friend of the boys?
- Oh, um, I'm Emma.

1017
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:44,032
Um, no, I just met the boys
at the robbery this morning, so...

1018
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:45,949
Robbery?

1019
01:13:47,492 --> 01:13:49,766
Funny story, actually. Um...

1020
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:52,357
we found out
that the care home was closing down,

1021
01:13:52,367 --> 01:13:54,649
and, you know, we...
we didn't want you to go up north...

1022
01:13:54,692 --> 01:13:55,774
And?

1023
01:13:56,825 --> 01:13:58,991
Well, we wanted to look after you so...

1024
01:13:59,825 --> 01:14:04,657
we sort of, uhm... robbed the bank.

1025
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:14,949
You robbed the bank?

1026
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:18,491
After all I've tried to teach you
about working for a living?

1027
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,282
After what happened to your mum
and dad, God rest their souls?

1028
01:14:26,108 --> 01:14:27,657
How much did you get?

1029
01:14:28,992 --> 01:14:30,241
Two and a half million.

1030
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:34,241
Well, that was really stupid.

1031
01:14:34,242 --> 01:14:35,532
Two and a half million.

1032
01:14:35,867 --> 01:14:37,866
It was irresponsible and wrong.

1033
01:14:37,868 --> 01:14:40,367
But you definitely
got the Macguire genes in you.

1034
01:14:42,808 --> 01:14:43,924
You're not angry?

1035
01:14:43,926 --> 01:14:47,699
Look, you risked prison to make sure
me and this lot were taken care of.

1036
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,032
You risked your lives
to come and save us.

1037
01:14:52,992 --> 01:14:54,657
I'm impressed.

1038
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,824
Cheers.

1039
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,949
But if you ever do it again,

1040
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:00,807
I shall knock seven shades of shit
out of the barrier!

1041
01:15:00,808 --> 01:15:01,941
We won't, granddad.

1042
01:15:01,952 --> 01:15:04,199
And don't fucking call me granddad!

1043
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,207
Terry, come on!

1044
01:15:06,209 --> 01:15:08,408
Get your toe down!
Let's get out of here!

1045
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:09,609
All right, here we go.

1046
01:15:32,567 --> 01:15:35,032
Fuck! I broke the gearbox.

1047
01:15:35,075 --> 01:15:37,907
Jesus Christ! I take it back!
You're a pair of idiots!

1048
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:41,282
We're near the river.
Maybe you can find a boat.

1049
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,032
Good idea! Let's get to the docks.

1050
01:15:57,783 --> 01:15:59,157
Go! Go! Go!

1051
01:16:02,908 --> 01:16:04,157
You can't have some at all!

1052
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:15,824
- Come on, Hamish!
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

1053
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:23,782
Doing well... Doing brilliant...

1054
01:16:26,858 --> 01:16:28,199
Keep up!

1055
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:30,866
Go! Get on the boat!

1056
01:16:32,542 --> 01:16:34,324
Hamish, come on, mate.
Hang on!

1057
01:16:39,225 --> 01:16:41,241
Not much further.

1058
01:16:42,825 --> 01:16:44,366
Fucking die!

1059
01:16:45,158 --> 01:16:47,541
- Come on, Hamish!
- Just got to get over there, okay?

1060
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,074
Get the boat started!

1061
01:17:02,376 --> 01:17:03,875
Take the bag!

1062
01:17:05,858 --> 01:17:07,274
Hamish, you're nearly there, bruv!

1063
01:17:07,275 --> 01:17:08,324
Christ, where's the key?

1064
01:17:08,367 --> 01:17:09,841
Come on, Hamish, sprint!

1065
01:17:09,843 --> 01:17:11,142
Stay!... Down!

1066
01:17:14,408 --> 01:17:15,366
Come on, Hammy.

1067
01:17:15,992 --> 01:17:18,199
- You all right, guys?
- Yes, come on!

1068
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,449
Get on the boat! Get on the boat!

1069
01:17:23,908 --> 01:17:25,157
Oh, there it is!

1070
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,866
We can't go!
We're still chained!

1071
01:17:48,742 --> 01:17:49,491
Fuck.

1072
01:17:51,075 --> 01:17:54,907
Oh, fucking hell! You want sumthin' done,
do it your fucking self!

1073
01:17:57,158 --> 01:18:00,032
Youse two!
Look after Katy... and Peggy!

1074
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:03,524
And get a fucking job,
or I'll come back and fucking haunt ya!

1075
01:18:03,526 --> 01:18:05,324
- What're you doing?
- Granddad!

1076
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:09,449
- Granddad!
- Go, granddad!

1077
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:17,866
- Granddad!
- Granddad!

1078
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,824
Go away! Fuck off!

1079
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,299
Fuck off!

1080
01:18:31,801 --> 01:18:33,300
Don't fucking shoot him!

1081
01:18:35,242 --> 01:18:38,407
You're free! You're free! You're free!

1082
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,866
Right.

1083
01:18:58,075 --> 01:18:59,548
- Andy!
- Andy!

1084
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:02,324
Oi! I'll take the fucking lot of ya!

1085
01:19:02,555 --> 01:19:04,024
And so will his brother!

1086
01:19:04,025 --> 01:19:05,116
And so will their cousin!

1087
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:06,907
This is for our granddad, you shits!

1088
01:19:26,492 --> 01:19:27,724
Come on!

1089
01:19:31,117 --> 01:19:33,115
I told you not to call me granddad!

1090
01:19:33,128 --> 01:19:34,616
Come on!

1091
01:19:45,783 --> 01:19:47,699
- Katy, I'm out!
- Here!

1092
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,074
Katy!

1093
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,866
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Not you again?

1094
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:07,366
Oh, Ray!

1095
01:21:09,075 --> 01:21:10,407
Oh, that is disgusting.

1096
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:16,199
All right, granddad.
All right, that'll do.

1097
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:20,699
- Oh, Andy. Oh, my baby. Oh...
- Oh, cheers. Cheers, Doreen, yeah.

1098
01:21:28,367 --> 01:21:30,532
Do you think they will sort this out?

1099
01:21:32,908 --> 01:21:34,324
They can't just leave it.

1100
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:36,325
I mean, we grew up here.
It's part of our history.

1101
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:38,949
East End's been through far worse, Katy.

1102
01:21:39,025 --> 01:21:41,532
It'll bounce back. Always has.

1103
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,474
Do you know why?
'Cause we're strong.

1104
01:21:43,476 --> 01:21:44,366
Well said!

1105
01:21:44,668 --> 01:21:48,397
And if it comes to it,
I shall round up every nutter,

1106
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:50,824
from Bermondsey to Canning Town,

1107
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:55,241
and we'll fucking sort this out,
the way we have done for centuries,

1108
01:21:55,325 --> 01:21:56,657
through the ages.

1109
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,782
We will look them in the eye.
We'll face them square on.

1110
01:21:59,783 --> 01:22:03,699
We'll fight them, and we'll win.
We shall prevail!

1111
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,366
Hurray! Yeah!

1112
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:08,032
Oi! Zombies!

1113
01:22:08,533 --> 01:22:11,366
Get the fuck out of my East End!
