1
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,245
- I don't know if I wanna do this.
- Relax, Laine, it's fun.

2
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,012
First, the rules.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,119
You can never, ever play alone.

4
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:47,947
You can never play in a graveyard.
And you always have to say goodbye.

5
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:52,529
To start, you circle the board
once for each player.

6
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:56,796
Then we say, "As friends we gather,
hearts are true."

7
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,535
"As friends we gather, hearts are true."

8
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,895
"Spirits near, we call to you."

9
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,241
"Spirits near, we call to you."

10
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,010
Is someone here with us?

11
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,379
Debbie, cut it out!

12
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:20,518
If a ghost is here, you can see them
through the planchette.

13
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:24,758
It's the eye to the other side.

14
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,826
If someone is here with us,
make yourself known.

15
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,615
What are you guys doing?

16
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,610
Get out of here, Sarah!

17
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,047
Calm down. It's only a game.

18
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:31,927
Goodbye.

19
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,125
- Laine, hey.
- Deb. Where are you?

20
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,728
I'm here. I've been here.

21
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,736
It's just been a little rough this week.

22
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,999
You've gotta tell me what's been going on.
And don't think you're bailing on me again.

23
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,113
- We're gonna be late for the game.
- Ugh. Oh, yeah.

24
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,105
You know, I don't think I'm coming.

25
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,211
Oh, well. I'm not leaving
until I get to talk to you.

26
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:31,744
Fine.

27
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,785
I'll be right out, just give me a sec.

28
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,010
What's going on?

29
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,036
- Are you sick?
- No.

30
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,439
- Did you and Pete have a fight?
- No, nothing like that.

31
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,140
Then what is it?

32
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,514
- Nothing.
- Debbie, tell me.

33
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,550
I just don't wanna go out tonight.

34
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,622
No secrets between us, remember?

35
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,020
Remember that game we used to play,
where you ask questions about the future?

36
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,592
- The Ouija board.
- Yeah.

37
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,893
A couple of weeks ago, I played it.

38
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:24,133
Just messing around and...

39
00:04:28,634 --> 00:04:30,636
I don't know. I don't know.

40
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,112
That is just a game.

41
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,183
You know you've always
been like this, right?

42
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,113
- Like what?
- Just a total and complete spaz.

43
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,051
You're right, I'm being crazy.

44
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,320
Look, I don't even have to go to the
basketball game. We always lose.

45
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,189
- I'm just gonna come in with you...
- No, don't.

46
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,632
I mean, my folks are gonna
be home any minute,

47
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,531
and I'm just being dramatic,
and everything is fine.

48
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,110
Are you sure you don't wanna come?

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,503
I have leftovers inside,
I'm gonna rock it out,

50
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,405
but I will see you in the morning,
that's for sure.

51
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,573
- Okay. Do you want me to order for you?
- Mmm-hmm.

52
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:09,142
- Pancakes with the works?
- Mmm-hmm.

53
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,414
Okay.

54
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,887
- I miss you.
- I miss you already.

55
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,518
No.

56
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,753
Laine, hey. Sorry I'm late.
I have a surprise for you.

57
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,192
Check this out.

58
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,884
Oh, you have a map.

59
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,853
Yep. This is the place
I was telling you about.

60
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,921
It's up the coast, away from everyone.

61
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,790
- We can make camp right about here.
- Yeah.

62
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,801
Hike down to the beach anytime we want.

63
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,527
It's the first time
I'm hearing it as "we."

64
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,368
I want you to come with.

65
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,632
But I thought this was your
big camping trip with the guys.

66
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,336
I know, but I started thinking about it
and I realized I'd miss you too much.

67
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,719
Okay, so you're surfing all day.
What do I do?

68
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:09,208
I'm gonna teach you. By the end of
the week, you'll be one with the waves.

69
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,616
- It's gonna be awesome.
- Oh, my God, no.

70
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,044
- I promise. Come on.
- Mmm-mmm.

71
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,488
You can forget about the world
for a while, leave it all behind.

72
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,849
I can't wait to see you
run this past my dad.

73
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,819
I got that covered, too. Tell him
it's the senior trip. Fully chaperoned.

74
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,155
- Good luck with that.
- What? I can be persuasive.

75
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,557
- Really?
- Yeah. I've been told this.

76
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,729
- By who?
- You. Every day.

77
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,568
Okay, very cute. Break it up, you two.

78
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:32,365
- Hello.
- Hey.

79
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,866
Hey, Iz. Little more bean juice.

80
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,001
Uh-huh.

81
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,271
Where's Debbie?

82
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:41,182
- Oh, I think she's running late.
- Mmm.

83
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:45,283
So, what time are we hitting
that party tonight?

84
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,986
- I think we're passing.
- Yeah. We might watch a movie or something.

85
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,816
- No, come on, you guys can't.
- Yeah.

86
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,520
Laine's making you bail on me.

87
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,298
You're a big girl, Iz.
There's nothing wrong with flying solo.

88
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,424
Yeah, me showing up alone,
that's not really a good look for me.

89
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,461
- Not everybody has, you know, this.
- What's this?

90
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,730
Your perfect couple situation.

91
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,132
Look at her acting like
she's not the one

92
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,000
who breaks up with every guy
she goes out with.

93
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,977
I can't help it, I'm a picky bitch.

94
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,237
God!

95
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,413
What's up?

96
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,083
I gotta go. It's my dad.

97
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,257
Let me guess, your sister?

98
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:26,791
Yep. Causing chaos wherever she goes.
I'm sorry, guys. Come on.

99
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:41,634
- What's going on?
- I'm so sorry.

100
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,837
Nona wanted to be here for you.
Laine, sit down. We need to talk.

101
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,672
I don't wanna sit down.
Just tell me what's going on.

102
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,040
Laine, sit down.

103
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,975
I don't wanna sit down!
Someone tell me what's going on!

104
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,213
It's about Debbie.

105
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,348
Nona, can I talk to you?

106
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,449
Uh-huh.

107
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,959
I don't think I can go in.

108
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,758
This doesn't seem real.
She should still be here.

109
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,362
She's still here.

110
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,271
She's right here.

111
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,897
Here.

112
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,806
I just don't understand.

113
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,541
None of us can.

114
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,977
She told me that she'd
see us the next morning.

115
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,879
Why would she say
that if she was going to...

116
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,652
We'll never know.

117
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,354
I wish she would have talked to us
about whatever it was.

118
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,094
I know what the police say,
but I can't believe she'd ever...

119
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:27,139
And that Carol found her like that,
it's just horrible.

120
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,842
They're packed and coming
to stay with me.

121
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,149
Can't be in this house another night.

122
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,522
Pete.

123
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,190
Laine.

124
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,029
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

125
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,305
I brought flowers.

126
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,331
Debbie liked this kind.

127
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,745
They're really pretty. Do you
want me to put them in some water?

128
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,637
No. I'll find her mom.

129
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,444
I should give them to her.

130
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,951
Laine.

131
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,524
- You were everything to her.
- Mrs. G.

132
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,203
I'm sorry. I just...

133
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,373
I just wanted to be in her room.

134
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,469
It's okay.

135
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,843
The hours you two spent in here.

136
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:41,974
Hmm.

137
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,754
And by fifth grade,
you'd picked out your college.

138
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,418
She used to draw pictures of...

139
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,930
of what our dorms would look like.

140
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,689
Everything was purple.

141
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,860
Yeah, I remember that.

142
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,300
Her purple phase.

143
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,934
Thank you for watching
the house while we're gone.

144
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,280
I don't know when we'll be back.

145
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,506
Here.

146
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,588
I put these things together for you.

147
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,986
She'd want you to have them.

148
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,018
Always remember her.

149
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:31,166
No, that's it,
that's the one. Look!

150
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,303
Let me see your bootyshake!

151
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,394
See? It's good!

152
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,063
Ladies, I need you
to keep it down in there.

153
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,733
We do have other customers.

154
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,503
We were a lot cooler than
we're making this seem.

155
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,305
Right. Pete says,
"How are you gonna dance?"

156
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,041
- Look at my girls!
- I'm glad I have it now!

157
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,477
- Oh, my God, I need to see you.
- I'm gonna cry!

158
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,815
- Aw, my girls! Look at you!
- Jeez.

159
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,283
- You need to pull that up a little.
- Booty-tooch.

160
00:16:58,383 --> 00:16:59,384
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God!

161
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,497
Why are you always pulling up my dress?

162
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:04,323
Whether or not you have
any sort of affection inside of you

163
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,458
that you want to give to your boyfriend...

164
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,895
- You don't think I have any affection?
- I mean, right now, I don't know.

165
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,002
You're gonna love me for doing that.

166
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,708
Mmm, why?

167
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,451
Really, Sarah?

168
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:59,646
After everything that happened today,
you have to do this?

169
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,481
- Do what?
- Sneak out.

170
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,857
Make things so hard, all the time.

171
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:09,456
Look, I just wanna get out of here
and forget this shitty day, all right?

172
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,329
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you're not going anywhere.

173
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:15,428
Mom is not around.
She hasn't been for a while.

174
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,903
And you don't need to be her, okay?

175
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,233
It's not your job to
hover over me all the time.

176
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,673
I wish I didn't have to.

177
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,244
Well, then just don't care so much.
It's way easier.

178
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,178
- Okay, Dad, here's your flight confirmation.
- Ah...

179
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,581
Once the permits get approved,
I'll be back.

180
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,816
- It might be a few days, though. Okay?
- Okay.

181
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,818
Nona knows I'm leaving,
so call her if you need anything.

182
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,959
Yeah, I got it covered, Dad.
Don't worry. Bye.

183
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,660
Have a safe trip.

184
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,598
I'll text you when I get there.

185
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,616
We have class in a half hour.
How long is this gonna take?

186
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,452
Um, Mrs. G just wants me to check
a few things. So, two minutes.

187
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,553
Sure.

188
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,166
Oh, and can you go around back
and check the pool cover?

189
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,861
Yeah, I got it.

190
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,601
Hello?

191
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,648
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

192
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,684
It's me. Are you ready to go?

193
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,092
I didn't even hear you come up.

194
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:01,453
What is that?

195
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:06,161
Just something Debbie and I
used to do ages ago.

196
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:09,203
- It was a joke, right?
- We pretended it was real.

197
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,397
We asked it questions like,
"Do I have a secret admirer?"

198
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,765
"Will we be friends forever?"

199
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:14,969
Things like that.

200
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,236
And one of you was just pushing it?

201
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:20,270
Yes.

202
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,850
I didn't know she had one.

203
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,516
I have so many questions.

204
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,191
If I had just stayed. I was right here.
If I hadn't have left her, you know...

205
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,817
Laine,

206
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,820
it's not your fault.

207
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,725
You just don't know when it's gonna be
the last time you get to talk to someone.

208
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,000
I never even got to say goodbye.

209
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,336
I know.

210
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,319
Pete.

211
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,064
- Hey.
- Hey.

212
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,161
Can you talk?

213
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,125
Yeah, sure.

214
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,226
Okay.

215
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,497
I haven't gotten a chance
to check in with you yet.

216
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,042
Are you doing okay?

217
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,409
I guess.

218
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,703
I can't bring myself
to erase her voicemails.

219
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,283
I keep listening to them
and it's like she's here, you know?

220
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,416
Leaving me messages, making plans.

221
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,677
Before Debbie died,

222
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:34,450
did you notice anything
going on with her?

223
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,816
Like what?

224
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,986
Acting different.

225
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,454
Yeah, she seemed worried
about something.

226
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,256
Did she ever say what it was?

227
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,393
It just kind of started out of nowhere.

228
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,734
I didn't know what was going on.
I'd text her, she'd blow me off.

229
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,741
I thought maybe she wanted to
break up with me or something.

230
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,170
A few days ago, I went to
her house to try to talk to her.

231
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,743
- She didn't even want me to come inside.
- She did the same thing with me.

232
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,452
- Why are you asking me all this?
- I guess I'm just not ready to let her go.

233
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,488
Neither am I.

234
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,805
I don't know. When I'm in the house,
it just feels strange.

235
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:26,898
- You miss Debbie. We all do.
- No, this is different.

236
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,767
I can't explain it.
It's like she's there.

237
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,037
Laine, listen.
Everyone's still in shock, okay?

238
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,740
But those things you were telling me
the other day about feeling guilty,

239
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,478
you don't have to keep
doing this to yourself.

240
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,513
Do you ever feel like even after
someone you love has died,

241
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,684
there's still a way
you can talk to them?

242
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,556
But you can't do that. She's gone.

243
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,955
The board. Isn't that what
you're supposed to do with it?

244
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,001
Yesterday, you said it was just a game.

245
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,927
If we play the game and nothing happens,
then I'll never bring it up again.

246
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:59,174
But I really wanna try,
so will you guys just do this with me?

247
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,200
Sarah?

248
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,068
I'm heading out. I'll be an hour.

249
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,167
Sarah!

250
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,598
- Yeah?
- I'm going out. I'll be back in a bit.

251
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,105
Hour. Yeah, cool. Got it.

252
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,656
Hey! Get out of here!

253
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,249
What the hell, Laine?

254
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,618
For a minute there,
I actually had a little faith in you.

255
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,755
- We hang out. What's wrong with that?
- What's wrong with that is that you're a kid

256
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,890
and that guy is too old for you!

257
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,892
All right. Since you can't be left alone,
you're coming with me.

258
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,432
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Get your stuff. I'll be in the car.

259
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,636
I don't wanna be in this house.
It feels wrong.

260
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,405
Look, this is where Debbie died.

261
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,644
We have to play here.

262
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,144
It's okay.

263
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,583
We're all together.

264
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,892
So, where are we gonna do this?

265
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:07,597
In there.

266
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,630
I'm gonna go and get the board.

267
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,683
How are you even supposed to talk
to someone using a board game?

268
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,782
I mean, like, "Yo, can you hear me?

269
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,988
"Signal's real bad.
I only got, like, one bar in here."

270
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:38,459
Your sister wants to do this.
So, just zip it and go along.

271
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,328
Hmm.

272
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,507
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus!

273
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,052
- Pete.
- It's okay.

274
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,711
It's just me. I heard you
come in through the front.

275
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,680
What the hell are you doing, man?

276
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,219
I have a spare key for the back.
I come in that way all the time.

277
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,271
- So, let's play.
- Wait.

278
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,606
There's a few rules first.

279
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,109
Like, you're never supposed
to play in a graveyard,

280
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,390
never play alone,
and always say goodbye.

281
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,717
Can we just do this?

282
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,760
I don't even think
I believe in these things,

283
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,756
but I still don't wanna touch it.

284
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:47,234
Come on. They sell them in toy stores.

285
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,609
Circle the board, once for each of us.

286
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,560
And then you say these words.

287
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,490
"As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

288
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,866
"Spirits near, we call to you."

289
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,869
If there's a presence here,
please make yourself known.

290
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,205
Is there a presence here among us?

291
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,847
This is a joke.

292
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,290
Come on, you guys. Who's doing that?

293
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,136
- Sarah, cut it out!
- I'm not pushing it.

294
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,202
Is there something you wanna tell us?

295
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,714
H-I...

296
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,493
It spelled, "Hi, friend."

297
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:25,924
Hi, friend.

298
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,498
When I was here yesterday, was that you?

299
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,567
Oh.

300
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,310
Who is this?

301
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,647
Debbie.

302
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,186
Sarah, if that's you pretending to be Debbie,
then that's really messed up.

303
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,649
- I swear it's not me, all right.
- Okay, this is freaking me out.

304
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:01,870
- Let's just stop it now.
- I'm sorry. Just put your hand back, please.

305
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,241
Debbie,

306
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,508
was there something I could have done?

307
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,283
Was there some way
we could have helped you?

308
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,891
If there's anything you wanna
tell us about why you did...

309
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,430
If you did this to yourself...

310
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,090
Did you really do this?

311
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:44,937
Guys, calm down. It's an old house.

312
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,409
Laine, keep going.

313
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:54,279
- Debbie, I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

314
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,722
We all do.

315
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,451
If you can hear us, we just...

316
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,896
I don't know, we just wanted
a chance to say goodbye.

317
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,678
- Laine!
- Iz.

318
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:31,684
It's not even real, okay?
It's just a game.

319
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,431
It's all the lights. They're all out.

320
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,970
So, be honest.
Was it you moving the planchette?

321
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,871
No.

322
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:30,043
- You?
- No. No way.

323
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,643
For all we know, it was Laine.

324
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,214
Maybe it was really
something she needed.

325
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,487
Might not have even known
she was doing it.

326
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,638
Is it Debbie? Did she do this?

327
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,179
- Where are you going?
- Just a second.

328
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:38,443
- Deb, is that you?
- Laine, please stop, okay? It's not her.

329
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,387
What if it is? What if she's
trying to tell me something?

330
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,399
Oh, my God!

331
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,274
- What happened? Are you okay?
- What was that?

332
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,541
I saw a reflection in the mirror,
and then someone pushed me from behind.

333
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,338
Can we just get out of here, please?

334
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,910
Come on.

335
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,767
- Why are you bringing that home?
- It was hers. I want it here.

336
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,231
What?

337
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,167
It's just that you need to believe
that was really Debbie.

338
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:39,237
You were there. It was weird, right?

339
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,145
Yeah, it was weird.

340
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,448
But I don't know if it means anything.

341
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,879
But what if it's her?
What if she wants to tell me something?

342
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:52,026
You wanted us to play, we did.
And now we can leave it alone.

343
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,694
Laine, you said goodbye to her.

344
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,800
I know you'll find the moment
when you're ready, but...

345
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,661
I think you can start to move on.

346
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,063
- Good night.
- Good night.

347
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,082
I couldn't sleep last night.

348
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,817
We don't have to talk about it.

349
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:03,321
I had all these weird dreams.
I keep thinking about being in her house.

350
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,828
Iz, I know you didn't wanna be there.

351
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:11,295
You did it for me. So, thank you.

352
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,806
I owe you.

353
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,237
Let's just forget the whole deal, yeah?

354
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,212
- Yeah.
- Okay.

355
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,065
Nona, what are you doing?

356
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,510
You should never touch these things.
You used it, didn't you?

357
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:53,032
It was just once.

358
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,241
Promise me, Laine. Do not go
seeking answers from the dead.

359
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,542
Get rid of the board.

360
00:37:58,642 --> 00:38:01,482
Yeah, I will. Mmm, I promise, Nona.

361
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,212
Who is that?

362
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,655
- Good night, Hank. See you tomorrow.
- Uh-huh.

363
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,820
Oh, hey, can you grab the
garbage on your way out?

364
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,495
Thank you.

365
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,760
Hi, Isabelle.

366
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,365
Where?

367
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,025
No, no, it doesn't sound crazy at all.

368
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,462
I'll pick you up.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

369
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,037
This idea of messages from the board

370
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,405
is nothing more than
our unconscious minds.

371
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:50,774
It's known as the ideomotor effect.

372
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:55,149
Involuntary motor muscles kick in
which drive the movement of the planchette.

373
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,082
We're simply telling ourselves
what we wanna believe.

374
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:18,636
Sarah?

375
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,881
- Was that you?
- No, I thought it was you.

376
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,318
Dad, you home?

377
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:36,553
Dad!

378
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,623
Go!

379
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,611
Do you have your phone?

380
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:01,779
- No.
- No?

381
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,480
Shh. It's outside.

382
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,382
Okay, just be quiet, just be quiet.

383
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:21,331
Sarah, stay back, okay?

384
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,929
Isabelle was shaking
when I picked her up last night.

385
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:55,675
I called this morning to check in.
She doesn't even wanna leave the house.

386
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,768
And I saw it, too.

387
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:01,305
"Hi friend." Carved right into my desk.

388
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:03,043
Did we all see it?

389
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,316
Debbie's trying to reach us.

390
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:13,884
- What could she want?
- If we wanna know, we gotta ask her.

391
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,176
I think we should say
the words together.

392
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,505
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

393
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:38,018
Spirits near, we call to you.

394
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,225
If there's a presence here,
make yourself known.

395
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,995
Debbie, we're all here for you.
We all got your messages. We're here.

396
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,441
Can you show us a sign?

397
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,088
Are you here?

398
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,608
Come on, guys.

399
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,291
You didn't kill yourself, did you?

400
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,157
I knew it.

401
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:03,201
Debbie, if you didn't do this, who did?

402
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,438
Did someone hurt you? Did someone...

403
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,802
Who did it? Who hurt you?

404
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,214
Debbie, why won't you answer us?

405
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:24,482
I have a question.

406
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,731
On our first real date
away from everybody else,

407
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,225
we told everybody we went to the fair,

408
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,737
but where did we really go?

409
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,418
We went to the lookout.

410
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,474
By the point, in the canyon.

411
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,629
Do you remember that?

412
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,247
What I said to you?

413
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,223
This isn't Debbie.

414
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,087
What do you mean?

415
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:07,733
I never took her there. Not once.

416
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,363
Is this you, Debbie?

417
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:14,934
Then who the hell is this?

418
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:17,367
"D."

419
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:22,844
"Z."

420
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,085
Is this who we were
talking to the other night?

421
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,185
Oh, my God.
Were we ever talking to Debbie?

422
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,356
Laine, we can stop.

423
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,103
When Debbie played the Ouija,
did she make contact with you?

424
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:46,866
D.Z., where are you?

425
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,769
The chair.

426
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,461
I don't see anything.

427
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,331
Guys, I think we should get out of...

428
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,103
"Run"?

429
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,945
- "She's coming."
- Who's coming?

430
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,017
"Mother."

431
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,140
- Sarah, wait!
- What happened in there, Laine?

432
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,420
It doesn't matter,
because we're not playing anymore.

433
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,578
Okay? We're walking away from
the board, the whole thing.

434
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:11,181
Debbie played, and now she's dead.

435
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:15,260
Look, what if we made the same mistake?
What if we broke some sort of rule?

436
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,221
Hey.

437
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,226
Hey. We're finished with this, okay?

438
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,807
Operation Clean House.

439
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,510
I get to clean

440
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:41,906
the attic!

441
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,244
God.

442
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,715
All right. Attic done.
I did the best I could. Um...

443
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,515
I'm not gonna lie, that was not fun.

444
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,925
However, I did find something.

445
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,996
Along with a lot of old junk
from the previous owners.

446
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,919
Ta-da! It's cool, right? Oh.

447
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,570
- They go together.
- She found it in her house.

448
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,600
Do I like my find?

449
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,801
Oh.

450
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,041
Yes. Am I cleaning the attic again? No.

451
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,855
Answer my question. I'm waiting.

452
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,761
"R."

453
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,493
She played alone?

454
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,731
"H-I-F-R-I-E-N-D." Whoa.

455
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,274
"Hi, friend."

456
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:38,053
As you know, our community has been
devastated the last few weeks.

457
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:42,286
First with Debbie, and now, Isabelle.

458
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,490
I wanted to talk to
each of you because...

459
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,733
I just wanna make sure
you and your friends are okay.

460
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:53,230
When you lose someone close to you,
there's always help available.

461
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,841
We care about you.

462
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,228
Now, um...

463
00:53:57,328 --> 00:54:00,482
there's a lot of very,
very helpful information in here

464
00:54:00,582 --> 00:54:04,117
about dealing with loss
and moving forward.

465
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,546
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

466
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:11,219
- Laine, we're only trying to help you.
- You can't.

467
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,817
I'm not even sure who can.

468
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,953
Trevor.

469
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,194
We need to talk. All of us.

470
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:24,661
You made us play. Now, Isabelle's dead.

471
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,063
I know, and I'll never forgive myself.

472
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:30,039
This thing, it's haunting us,

473
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:34,043
wherever we go,
watching everything we do.

474
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,545
It's coming for all of us.
So, who's next?

475
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:44,281
Hey.

476
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,949
- Look, back there with Trevor...
- He's right.

477
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:49,730
Hey, I need you. It's just us now.

478
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,929
What does this spirit wanna do with us?

479
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:56,893
It's angry. When Debbie played,
she woke something up in her house.

480
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,536
Okay?

481
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,967
Pete, please. I need your help.

482
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,759
I think that's where Debbie found it.

483
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,979
Laine, are you all right?

484
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:03,254
- Laine!
- I'm coming!

485
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:13,627
Pete.

486
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,164
Pete, grab this.

487
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,332
It's heavy. Okay.

488
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,600
Laine!

489
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,080
Hey, this is the family.

490
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,150
For some reason,
they're still connected to the house.

491
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,353
From the look of these photos, I'd say
this is the late '40s, the early '50s.

492
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,122
Is there a way to get any records?

493
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,066
I don't know.
Property archives or something?

494
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,534
I can try.

495
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,895
We need to find out who they are.

496
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,448
Laine, you should come look at this.

497
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,924
I found this old article.

498
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,090
Doris Zander.

499
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,900
D.Z. This is her.

500
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,476
Pete, listen. Doris Zander.

501
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,401
She used to live in
Debbie's house with her mother.

502
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,373
D.Z. was a missing girl.
They never found her.

503
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,380
They suspected the mother had something
to do with her disappearance.

504
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,922
So, who is the other girl
in the pictures with them?

505
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,762
Doris had a sister.

506
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,500
And she might still be alive.

507
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:39,911
May I help you?

508
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:42,846
I'm here for visiting hours.

509
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:07,802
Thank you.

510
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,236
They told me my niece was here to visit.

511
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,713
I don't have a niece.

512
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:19,112
My name is Laine. I'm here to
ask about your sister, Doris.

513
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,078
Doris.

514
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,757
My best friend, Debbie,
lived in your old house.

515
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:29,418
She's not alive anymore.

516
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,561
And this is gonna sound
really strange but...

517
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,862
but I think I know why.

518
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,269
I believe there's a
presence in that house.

519
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,646
I wouldn't be surprised
if there's more than one.

520
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,981
I found pictures of you and your sister.

521
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,144
You found pictures?
You found my family photos?

522
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,913
Yeah. I can bring them to you,
or send them, if you like.

523
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,815
Please bring them.

524
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:03,686
I haven't seen my sister's face
in a very long time.

525
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:07,197
At least not her real face.

526
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:16,034
I believe I saw her.
Me and my friends. And her lips,

527
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,809
they were stitched shut.

528
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:23,010
Mother did that to her.

529
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,195
My mother practiced mediumship.

530
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,387
And if practice makes perfect,
let me tell you,

531
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:41,624
she was pretty damn good,
depending on your point of view.

532
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:46,231
She conducted seances,
she used spirit boards. Anything.

533
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:50,033
A bit reckless, actually.
Doris loved my mother.

534
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:54,378
She wanted to help.
She was fascinated by it all.

535
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:59,442
And when the seances got bigger
and my mother really made connections,

536
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:03,079
she needed a vessel.
A vessel to give them a voice.

537
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:06,023
- Who?
- The spirits.

538
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,186
She used Doris.

539
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,496
And then something
went wrong with Mother.

540
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:17,493
Chasing the dead and living in all
those shadows, something snapped.

541
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:20,435
She couldn't turn it off.
She couldn't break the connection.

542
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:24,038
Mother was consumed by them.

543
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:26,042
She was insane.

544
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,140
So, she did that to Doris.

545
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:35,088
To her lips. To stop them from talking.

546
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,424
And then Doris went missing?

547
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,022
Missing.

548
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:45,531
She never left the house, did she?

549
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,459
No. No, she didn't.

550
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,499
Mother wasn't herself. She killed Doris.

551
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:58,401
And after that, I did what I
needed to do to stop Mother.

552
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:03,180
That's why I'm here.

553
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,114
But that doesn't mean Mother is gone.

554
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,418
- How did you see her?
- What?

555
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:18,321
You said you saw her.

556
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:21,424
You said you saw her lips.
How did you see her?

557
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,859
You wouldn't have been able
to see her. Not unless you...

558
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:27,373
Look, I just wanna stop whatever it is
that is happening. My friends are dying.

559
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,333
No, you opened up a channel.

560
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,909
You made a connection. With what?

561
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:38,207
- A spirit board, I bet.
- Yeah.

562
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:41,644
You played in a graveyard,
and now she's awake again.

563
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,755
Both of them. Mother, too.

564
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,918
And if you could see them...

565
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:49,118
- Just through the planchette.
- Not for long.

566
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,319
They're getting stronger.

567
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,952
The points of connection. In your case,
it's the body and the board.

568
01:04:56,052 --> 01:05:00,663
The link is between them.
The energy is growing,

569
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:03,175
and it is hard to stop.

570
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,638
Mother used to have a secret room.

571
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:12,117
She sealed it up, after Doris,
down in the basement.

572
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:16,012
Don't go alone.
Mother will try to stop you.

573
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:17,513
What do I have to do?

574
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:20,516
You need to cut
the stitches from her mouth.

575
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:25,725
And if it works, you have to pray
that Doris can deal with Mother.

576
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:30,669
It's supposed to be somewhere here.
Pete, grab this.

577
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,136
This is crazy, Laine.

578
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,710
We should just leave.
We shouldn't be here.

579
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,048
What?

580
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,919
The shadow.

581
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,986
Trevor!

582
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:01,094
Trevor!

583
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:07,071
Pete! Trevor! Pete!

584
01:06:12,968 --> 01:06:15,571
Laine! Keep going!

585
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,382
Sarah, I need your help!

586
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,330
Laine!

587
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,766
Stay there. I found her.

588
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:57,106
No, no, no, not now.

589
01:07:57,273 --> 01:08:00,113
Come on. Stop. Come on!

590
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:13,626
Come on.

591
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:41,517
Come on.

592
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:44,120
No!

593
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,925
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

594
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,521
Where's Laine?

595
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,747
Okay, to our future selves,

596
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:21,723
I hope we look back on this, and, um...

597
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,452
- No, it looks so good.
- My boobs look huge.

598
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,487
Okay, turn around.
What does it look like in the back?

599
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:27,291
Hold on. Let me see.

600
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,857
You look so beautiful!

601
01:10:28,957 --> 01:10:30,059
- I know.
- Thank you.

602
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,895
Oh, my babies. Look at my angels.

603
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:41,914
I miss you, Debbie. All the time.

604
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,131
Debbie?

605
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:19,768
Ms. Zander.

606
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:23,439
Oh. My tenacious little niece.

607
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,374
I did everything you said.

608
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:28,177
We found the body, I cut the stitches,
she sent Mother away.

609
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,052
But it didn't work. Why didn't it work?

610
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,554
Mother must have come back, because my
friend Pete, another friend, is dead.

611
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:41,590
She's free.

612
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,696
You lied to me.

613
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:52,477
Your mother didn't try to hurt us.
She tried to stop us.

614
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:57,397
Your mother wasn't
the one that was evil.

615
01:12:57,497 --> 01:13:01,417
- It was...
- I told her that I would help her.

616
01:13:04,112 --> 01:13:05,989
I heard the voices, too.

617
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:10,120
They tell you the most wonderful,

618
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,976
awful things.

619
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:18,397
You're gonna hear them, too,
little girl.

620
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:23,970
You'll hear them soon enough
because she's coming to get you, too.

621
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,636
- I always told her. I told her.
- Ms. Zander.

622
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:30,939
She's gonna be nice to me.
She knows I was gonna help her

623
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,242
- and now she's gonna be nice to me.
- Calm down. You have to calm down.

624
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,444
She's gonna keep her promises!

625
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,256
She's gonna keep her promises!

626
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:39,849
No! No!

627
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:47,030
You have to break the connection
or it will keep coming back for you.

628
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,758
- I'll burn the board.
- That won't be enough.

629
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,804
A spirit this strong
could bring it back.

630
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:56,098
A connection, once made to a spirit,
is very difficult to break.

631
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:00,065
The board is just the conduit.
You have to sever the connection

632
01:14:00,165 --> 01:14:01,514
- on both sides.
- How?

633
01:14:01,614 --> 01:14:05,541
Your connection is through the board
and that little girl's body.

634
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:09,081
The spirit lives through both of them,
so you must destroy them both.

635
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:12,891
- What? Destroy the body?
- And the board. And you must hurry.

636
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:15,586
- I'll call Trevor.
- Thank you.

637
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,708
- Trevor.
- Sarah?

638
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:36,580
We're back here.

639
01:14:37,305 --> 01:14:38,479
Wait up!

640
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,528
Sarah?

641
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:01,196
Laine?

642
01:15:24,886 --> 01:15:26,593
Trevor's already here.

643
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:35,366
Trevor!

644
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:40,942
Where is he?

645
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:31,486
Trevor?

646
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,808
No!

647
01:16:58,346 --> 01:17:00,116
Laine, what do we do?

648
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,293
Laine!

649
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,822
Go get the board.

650
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,753
- We need the body, too.
- Let's burn this damn thing...

651
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:36,687
- Laine!
- Sarah!

652
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,021
Sarah!

653
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:51,700
Ah!

654
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:08,250
Hey!

655
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:20,328
As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

656
01:18:20,428 --> 01:18:22,101
Spirits near, we call to you.

657
01:18:23,798 --> 01:18:25,700
Doris, I'm playing alone!
You have to play!

658
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:57,198
Ow!

659
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:46,111
Hey.

660
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:51,313
- Feeling any better?
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

661
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:54,049
I just miss them.

662
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,953
All the time.

663
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:58,021
Yeah, me too.

664
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,489
I guess you never really feel like
you get to say goodbye

665
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:04,160
and maybe that's okay.

666
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,665
Oh, well... Maybe there are no goodbyes.

667
01:21:09,597 --> 01:21:11,299
Not really.

668
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:19,345
I keep wondering about that night.

669
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:23,585
That poor little girl.

670
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:29,524
All of those dark spirits
that were in her.

671
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:33,527
Where do you think they went?
