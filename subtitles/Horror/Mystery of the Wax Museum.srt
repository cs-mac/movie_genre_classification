1
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,998
Well, my friend,
this is an unexpected pleasure.

2
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,421
- Come in.
- Thank you.

3
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:28,007
How do you do?

4
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,430
I wouldn't disturb you,
but the friend I spoke to you about...

5
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:36,892
is leaving town tomorrow to supervise
some new excavations in Egypt.

6
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:39,937
He was most anxious
to see your collection before going away.

7
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,856
- May I present Mr. Galatalin.
- Why, this is a great pleasure.

8
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,567
I've heard so much about you.

9
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,860
How do you do?

10
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:47,486
Follow me, gentlemen.

11
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,202
My children would become conceited
that so distinguished a critic...

12
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:56,788
has thought them
interesting enough to review.

13
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:09,218
Splendid.

14
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,512
Joan of Arc. Beautiful.

15
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:14,432
It's a pity to race through
such an exhibition.

16
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:16,685
And here is Voltaire.

17
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:24,068
One might almost expect him to speak.

18
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,988
I wonder what he'd say
after all these years.

19
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,739
You would be astonished.

20
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:32,952
He is more difficult now, to those
in authority, than even the records show.

21
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:36,373
He is a very stubborn person, I assure you.

22
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:38,166
- Stubborn?
- Unbelievably.

23
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,419
For days I argued with this fellow...

24
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,546
before getting him just as I wanted.

25
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:44,590
But always, I triumphed.

26
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,760
And few people triumphed
over Monsieur Voltaire.

27
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:51,180
And here, gentlemen....

28
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,766
Here is something that pleases me...

29
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:56,853
although of no historic importance.

30
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,606
It was done because
I love to model children.

31
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:02,401
Note, gentlemen,
the line of the shoulder and--

32
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:05,988
You have no right to hide such genius
in a side-street museum.

33
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,657
You are very gracious.

34
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,285
These things have some merit,
I suspect, but this....

35
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:14,122
Will you come this way,
gentlemen, please?

36
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,128
This, I'm convinced, is fine.

37
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:22,256
- Marie Antoinette?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,008
Beautiful composition.

39
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:27,303
Even those delicate veins
and the texture of that flesh.

40
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:30,181
I never saw anything more exquisite.

41
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:33,852
But, tell me, where did you begin
to model in wax?

42
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,813
In my native country, at first, as a hobby.

43
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:40,317
- He has a great reputation as a sculptor.
- You are very kind, sir.

44
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:42,653
However, I was commissioned
to come to England...

45
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:45,739
and with the completion of my work,
I turned my mind to these...

46
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:48,784
because it seemed to satisfy me more.

47
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:52,830
I felt I could reproduce the warmth
and flesh and blood of life...

48
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:56,000
far more better in wax than in cold stone.

49
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,128
If you will grant me the privilege...

50
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:01,632
I'd like to submit your work
to the Royal Academy when I get back.

51
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:02,883
Royal--

52
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:08,222
You will have won
the undying gratitude of all of us.

53
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,350
Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?

54
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:14,604
I regret that I have not the time
to give to your exhibition now...

55
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,439
but I'll worry you more when I get back.

56
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:19,985
It will always afford me
the greatest pleasure to welcome you.

57
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:24,823
I must apologize again for coming
and disturbing you at this late hour.

58
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,493
It was a great pleasure, I assure you.

59
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,247
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

60
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,583
- And I'm very grateful to you.
- Not at all.

61
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,002
Thank you for your visit
and your encouragement.

62
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,380
- Good night, lvan.
- Good night.

63
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:04,491
My masterpiece, my Marie Antoinette.

64
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:07,953
You heard what this man,
who is very celebrated, said of you?

65
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:13,126
Yes, of course. You would say that.

66
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:16,713
You always told me so, of course.

67
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:22,135
Hello, there!

68
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:24,763
Hello.

69
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,933
What are you doing here so late?

70
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:31,103
I came for some books. I'm trying
to straighten out the accounts.

71
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:33,940
I don't hope to impress you
but we haven't a farthing.

72
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,483
That is unfortunate.

73
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:38,028
You're right, it's unfortunate.

74
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,780
*15,000 it's cost me,
and you say it's unfortunate...

75
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:43,241
as though I spilled soup on my vest.

76
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:47,288
Your money may be very well invested,
one never knows.

77
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:49,457
Something important may come of all this.

78
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,292
Something has got to come of all this.

79
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,753
- The rent on this place isn't paid.
- ls that a fact?

80
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,797
No, I'm lying to amuse myself.

81
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:59,884
Now, look here. I have an idea
that will get us out of all this.

82
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:03,513
You and I have absolutely no money,
but we have got this.

83
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:07,101
- Fire insurance.
- Yes, insurance. That's our way out.

84
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:10,187
You know that a fire in this place
will give us *10,000?

85
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,439
A fire?

86
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,900
Is this your idea of humor, my friend?

87
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,861
I want the money back
that I've thrown into this rubbish heap.

88
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,530
You're asking to burn these people?

89
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:21,032
- You are asking to destroy all--
- I'm not asking you.

90
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:23,118
- I'm telling you.
- You think I'll permit this?

91
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,328
You've got to permit it.

92
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,663
Whose fault is it
if people don't come here?

93
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:29,166
Yours. All this artistic nonsense.

94
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,128
The museum at Walston Lane
does well enough.

95
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:35,131
And why? Because they have
Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare...

96
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:36,215
the Mad Butcher...

97
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:39,844
the Demon Barber of Fleet Street,
things that people pay to see!

98
00:07:39,928 --> 00:07:41,388
And they are welcome to them.

99
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:43,932
To perpetuate such scoundrels
is to celebrate their crimes.

100
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:46,226
What do think I'm in this for?

101
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,396
A match. A cigar stub, even...

102
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,650
and you and I have *10,000
to divide between us.

103
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,277
You are insane.

104
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,738
No, I'm not insane. Not at all.

105
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,327
Let me show you
how easily it can be done.

106
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:09,919
Wait, you!

107
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:47,863
Anything new, Doc?

108
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:49,781
Nothing we didn't tell you this afternoon.

109
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,117
The coroner confirmed our opinion.
It was suicide.

110
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,787
Gee, that'll make a swell story. Come on.

111
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,946
Hello, is that you, Tim?

112
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,408
I'm sorry, but I've got to have that tonight.
I've got to have it.

113
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:11,078
No, I tell you, I need it right away.

114
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:14,790
Who's on the gate down there?

115
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:17,209
Joe? Then you can get it out, all right.

116
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,295
I'll send a truck right down there.

117
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,214
The harness bull's okay.

118
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:23,550
I straightened it out this afternoon.

119
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:47,534
New Year's Eve ain't what it used to be.

120
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:49,870
This is only the second one tonight.

121
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,372
Times sure are tough.

122
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,874
What happened to this one?

123
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:57,378
Husband slapped her full of lumps.
Said she talked too much.

124
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,176
What's that?

125
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,805
Embalming fluid. It makes them jump.

126
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,061
Ain't that just like a woman?
Always has to have the last word.

127
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:37,384
As I live and breath
and wear spats, the prince.

128
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:40,262
You've been doing experiments
with Scotch and soda again?

129
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:42,932
Where did you get that news item?
From a little bird?

130
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,225
Have a pleasant vacation?

131
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:46,227
Charming. More delightful people crippled.

132
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:47,770
That's fine.

133
00:16:47,812 --> 00:16:49,814
Consider yourself crippled financially.

134
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:52,609
See if you can jar your friends loose
for enough to eat.

135
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:53,652
Meaning what?

136
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:55,904
You're a sure bet
to place in the bread line.

137
00:16:55,988 --> 00:16:58,616
There's no room on this rag
for the purely ornamental.

138
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:01,452
You're easy on the eyes
and pretty conceited about it.

139
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:03,496
Is mama's dumpling getting tough?

140
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm through clowning, Florence.
You're all washed up. Get out!

141
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,085
What do you mean? It's New Year's!

142
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:11,463
We still get out a newspaper.
Ever thought of that?

143
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:15,133
- ls it my fault if nothing happens?
- What do you mean, nothing happens?

144
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,136
Look down there!

145
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:19,680
Out of that insane mob,
you say nothing happens?

146
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:21,932
There's a story
in every person down there.

147
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:26,145
Do I circulate among them and say
"Would you tell me the story of your life?"

148
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:28,690
Getting newspaper stories
is none of our business.

149
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,358
You're through. Get out.

150
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:31,985
Go on, get out.

151
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:34,821
You're fired unless you bring a story
for the next edition!

152
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:37,699
Even if it's only
a new recipe for spaghetti!

153
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:30,673
I thought I told you to keep out of here.

154
00:18:30,924 --> 00:18:33,051
I won't bother you, but I'm all in.

155
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:34,469
My nerves are all shot.

156
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,805
Your nerves aren't the only things
that'll be shot.

157
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:38,891
You've been smoking again.

158
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:42,394
Give him a bag.

159
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:46,524
Thanks.

160
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:49,152
Come on.

161
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,696
And understand this...

162
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,865
you get nothing
until you show me something.

163
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:56,576
The next time you talk
out of turn you'll have bad luck.

164
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:57,995
- Understand?
- Thanks.

165
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,442
Happy New Year!

166
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:28,152
Hey, Miss Dempsey.

167
00:19:28,403 --> 00:19:32,115
Wonder how they'll settle the heavyweight
argument while you're around.

168
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:38,497
Hello, sweetheart. How's your sex life?

169
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:42,251
So you're in again.

170
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,587
Hey, Jim, call out the riot squad.

171
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,256
- How's every little old thing?
- Fine.

172
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,676
You're the first reporter here in two hours.

173
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:54,055
- You people been seeing the old year out?
- I'm people which the old year saw out.

174
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:55,766
- I'm fired.
- No kidding.

175
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:58,477
I gotta make news if I have to bite a dog.
Hey, Kelly.

176
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:01,397
Oh, my gosh, even he walked out on me.

177
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:04,275
I've got a story for you.
You know the Joan Gale girl?

178
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:07,487
She committed suicide yesterday.
I read about it last year.

179
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:10,490
Yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide.

180
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:13,368
- She may have been murdered.
- No kidding? Any suspects?

181
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:16,163
- You know George Winton?
- Old Howard Winton's cub?

182
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:18,540
- That's him.
- They don't suspect him?

183
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:21,126
Don't they?
He's down at the Tombs right now.

184
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,712
- lf you're stringing me, old timer....
- Why should l?

185
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:26,507
- They were sweeties till last month.
- What does that prove?

186
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:29,552
Nothing. Only she may have tried
to blackmail him.

187
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:31,554
You know, such things have happened.

188
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:35,016
Anyway, he was in her apartment
a few hours before she was found dead.

189
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:39,104
- Saved, one job.
- The press room for yours.

190
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:42,441
- Wait till I give you the rest of the dirt.
- Make it snappy.

191
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:45,695
They've ordered an autopsy over
at Bellevue immediately. Go there.

192
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:47,697
- Don't give this to anyone else.
- It's yours.

193
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:48,865
Thanks!

194
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,745
Fresh kid!

195
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:07,468
- Feeling tough?
- Rotten.

196
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:09,554
]That's too bad, sister.

197
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:12,682
I have a case of jitters
that will cop the Pulitzer Prize.

198
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:16,102
If they don't hurry up,
they'll have another corpse on their hands.

199
00:21:19,273 --> 00:21:21,734
Bring in number seven. The Gale girl.

200
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:25,070
She's a very interesting case.

201
00:21:25,154 --> 00:21:29,325
When I was called, the girl had been dead
for possibly three or four hours.

202
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:33,204
My examination clearly showed
that she died of laudanum poisoning.

203
00:21:33,288 --> 00:21:36,416
I thought at first it might have been
an accident. An overdose.

204
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:40,087
Her eyes indicated
that she used narcotics frequently.

205
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:42,589
- What was the police theory?
- Suicide.

206
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:44,174
- Leave any message?
- No.

207
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,594
That's why I thought it was an accident.

208
00:21:46,802 --> 00:21:48,888
- Are you in charge of the case?
- Yes, sir.

209
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,598
Who got the information about Winton?

210
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,559
Everyone knew they were living together.

211
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:54,853
But he was playing around
with some other twist.

212
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:58,106
Winton was in bad though
because he left before she folded up.

213
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,403
If she committed suicide with laudanum
she probably took it in its true form...

214
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:04,947
and we'll find it in that
or very close to that state.

215
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:07,450
If someone gave it to her,
it would be diluted.

216
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:11,162
- But how could he give it to her?
- ln a cup of coffee or a glass of whiskey.

217
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:13,456
- That's possible.
- The Gale body is gone.

218
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,083
- What are you talking about?
- Absurd!

219
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,127
What do you mean? The body is gone?

220
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,254
Just that. It's vanished.
Gone. Disappeared.

221
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,048
You mean to say someone stole the body?

222
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,301
We found the slab empty
and the window to the alley was open.

223
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,469
Come on.

224
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,647
Boy, and he asked for a story.
Is his face red!

225
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:37,858
Bryant, 2626.

226
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,321
- Hello.
- Hello, slug.

227
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,323
Kill that Winton story for this.

228
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,784
Joan Gale's body was....
Not John Brown's.

229
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,996
Joan Gale's body was snatched
from the morgue two minutes ago.

230
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:51,748
I'm here now.

231
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,667
Yeah, there were nine or ten witnesses.

232
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:57,337
No, they didn't talk. They're pretty stiff.

233
00:22:57,587 --> 00:22:59,506
No, dope, not drunk. Dead.

234
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:03,510
Get out of the Tombs and get to Winton.
I'll have Harry write the first flash.

235
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:06,180
A cow does that, and gives milk besides.

236
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:09,183
Send Harry in.

237
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:27,787
- How do you do? I'm from the Express.
- Yeah?

238
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:29,830
I don't want to talk to you.

239
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:33,251
I know you people. You'll try to crucify me
for something I didn't do.

240
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:35,545
Anything you print about me,
you've got to prove.

241
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:37,964
You know you're innocent
till you're proven guilty.

242
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:40,258
That's fine.
But while I'm proving my innocence...

243
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:43,262
you people will uncover
every petty kid trick I ever did.

244
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:45,764
You'll write editorials
about every cocktail I drank.

245
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:48,058
Anything that any normal person
might have done...

246
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:50,019
will have a sinister meaning if I did it.

247
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:53,356
It'll be a lot easier if you come clean.
Let's get down to cases.

248
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:56,234
- When did you see this girl last?
- ln the afternoon before--

249
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:59,696
- Why didn't you tell that to the police?
- They didn't give me a chance.

250
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,741
We had a couple of drinks.
She was all right. She seemed happy.

251
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:04,493
Do you remember what she said?
What did you talk about?

252
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,121
She laughed
and she said we were being very silly...

253
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:10,750
that we didn't care for each other anymore
but we needn't hate each other.

254
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,211
- Said she wanted us to be friends.
- Was that all?

255
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:15,713
No. We planned a trip.
I was sending her to Bermuda.

256
00:24:15,797 --> 00:24:17,424
- You weren't going with her?
- No.

257
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:21,219
- Why didn't I take her away somewhere?
- Let's get back to the case in hand.

258
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:24,473
They ordered an autopsy
and found her body had been stolen.

259
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:25,557
No.

260
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:28,102
What are you trying to do to me?

261
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:31,230
- You're working with the police--
- I'm trying to help you...

262
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:33,274
if you're on the square and I think you are.

263
00:24:33,316 --> 00:24:36,986
- Why are you telling me a crazy lie, then?
- That happens to be the truth.

264
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:40,448
- But who'd steal her body?
- That's what they'll ask you.

265
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:42,784
- Come on, time's up.
- Be right with you.

266
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:45,829
Keep a stiff upper lip, kid.
I think you'll come out okay.

267
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:52,420
Go ahead, I'm listening.

268
00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:54,547
The whole thing sounded
on the up and up to me.

269
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,592
Poor guy's too scared to lie.
I think he's getting a raw deal.

270
00:24:57,675 --> 00:25:00,512
Ain't that a shame.
Nice little chap, wouldn't harm a fly.

271
00:25:00,595 --> 00:25:02,514
Everyone picking on the poor little fellow.

272
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:04,975
If he was unknown,
they wouldn't have pinched him.

273
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:06,977
He's George Winton
and they're playing it up.

274
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:09,396
It's a Roman holiday for every editor
in New York.

275
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,773
Why the goose pimples?

276
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:13,860
If he was someone like me,
you'd be trying to hang him.

277
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:16,404
I wouldn't be trying, beloved,
I would hang him.

278
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,324
All that gaga
about that body disappearing....

279
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:22,411
Eight bodies have been stolen in New York
in the last 18 months.

280
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:25,080
Isn't it more reasonable
to hook this up from that angle?

281
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:27,291
And ruin a perfectly good story?
Don't be silly.

282
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:29,460
I think this kid's entitled to a break.

283
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:32,838
- He's getting it. He's front page.
- You give me a pain.

284
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:34,632
I'm glad to hear it.

285
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:37,343
Since when did you start crusading
for justice?

286
00:25:37,427 --> 00:25:40,597
This mug with all the money
has had two or three nasty affairs.

287
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,350
He's kept out of print,
because his grandfather was smart.

288
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,352
He couldn't have stolen the body from jail.

289
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:48,230
Don't think he'd be sap enough
to do the job himself, do you?

290
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:49,565
I hope they give him the works.

291
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,443
Even if he didn't kill her,
he's responsible for her death...

292
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:55,071
and they can fry him any time
without making me sore.

293
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,907
- I won't work on it from that angle.
- You won't?

294
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:00,702
You were pretty tough about
Judge Ramsey, a while ago.

295
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:01,995
They didn't prove anything against him.

296
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:04,456
Except that he disappeared
when things got too hot.

297
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:06,542
Or was killed by someone afraid of him.

298
00:26:06,792 --> 00:26:10,004
- He took a run-out powder.
- That's got nothing to do with this case.

299
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:12,381
- Can I handle this my way?
- You cannot.

300
00:26:12,423 --> 00:26:14,717
I'm still editor of this newspaper.

301
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:17,720
You said I was fired. Well, I quit!

302
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:20,390
- Give the assignment to somebody else.
- Wait a minute.

303
00:26:20,473 --> 00:26:22,017
No, I'm through!

304
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:24,394
Come here, sob sister.

305
00:26:25,562 --> 00:26:27,523
All right. Go ahead.

306
00:26:27,981 --> 00:26:29,233
Do it your own way.

307
00:26:29,316 --> 00:26:31,944
On the square,
if you'd seen that kid down there...

308
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:35,615
I'm not holding for him,
maybe he is a dirty pup, but he's scared...

309
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:37,867
and so kind of dumb and worthless.

310
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,078
If he is, we'll give him away
as a bridge prize.

311
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,372
Come on, beat it.
It's 5:. 00. You need some sleep.

312
00:26:42,455 --> 00:26:45,626
- There's another point.
- Sleep on it. We'll get it tomorrow.

313
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,044
Here's your portrait.

314
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:51,757
- Which one is me? The horse?
- Get out of here.

315
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,544
If my curiosity is not too great...

316
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:28,589
would you mind telling me
what animal you are designing?

317
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:31,133
One of the Athenian girls
for the bacchanal.

318
00:27:31,175 --> 00:27:34,971
It would be interesting to know
where and when you studied anatomy.

319
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:38,308
It doesn't seem so bad to me.
What is wrong with it?

320
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:39,893
Anatomy.

321
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:41,978
Heaven forgive you.

322
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:44,815
You must have studied
with a sideshow of .

323
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,650
I'm sorry, sir. I'll change it.

324
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,611
The reason I wanted to work with you
was to learn about that.

325
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:51,280
And this fellow.

326
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:54,617
Look what this cobbler is doing.

327
00:28:00,665 --> 00:28:02,125
What is this?

328
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,670
Are you so beautiful that you make
everything in your own likeness?

329
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:09,800
It's a mercy of Providence
that this fellow cannot hear.

330
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,388
Anatomy.

331
00:28:15,431 --> 00:28:17,350
A great sculptor.

332
00:28:18,393 --> 00:28:19,644
And I am barred.

333
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:24,566
Look.

334
00:28:25,692 --> 00:28:27,444
Look at these claws.

335
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,864
If I had those hands of yours...

336
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:34,118
I would show you the meaning
of what you are trying to do.

337
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:37,497
All those beautiful things
that were destroyed...

338
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:40,542
I could restore.

339
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:47,674
It is a cruel irony
that you people without souls...

340
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,219
should have hands.

341
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:53,305
But go on, go back to work.

342
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,934
It is useless and hopeless
to talk to such people.

343
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:05,068
Who is it?

344
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,862
Got it? Is it completed?

345
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,115
Yes, sir, it's ready,
but it's pretty heavy and I'll need help.

346
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:14,370
Come in here. Help Professor Darcy.

347
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:15,579
And hurry.

348
00:29:17,081 --> 00:29:19,834
The figure has yet to be mounted
and dressed.

349
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:26,299
And now, my friend,
you are to see something...

350
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:29,011
that one truly can describe as art.

351
00:29:29,595 --> 00:29:33,516
Professor Darcy doesn't try to keep
freedom and sketchiness in his work.

352
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:37,770
He is an artist.
His figures are realistic, lifelike.

353
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:42,317
He works at home, hours when
such people as you are loafing.

354
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:49,616
- Shall we open it?
- Yes.

355
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:25,155
Exquisite. Almost as beautiful
as the original.

356
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,534
Someday I hope to have you restore
Marie Antoinette.

357
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:31,537
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.

358
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,039
Take her in. Dress her for the opening.

359
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,260
I think I'll have something to tell you soon.

360
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,431
You have done well,
and I too have something for you.

361
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:50,849
Thanks.

362
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:12,581
Hello?

363
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:15,876
Hello! I was just thinking about you.

364
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:18,963
Yeah, I was, too.

365
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:21,466
No, I haven't forgotten.

366
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:24,719
I won't have much time,
we'll have to eat someplace close.

367
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:28,598
Let's go to that little Bohemian place.

368
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:31,518
- All right, I'll meet you in the lobby.
- At 12:00.

369
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:33,020
Bye.

370
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:36,106
Who was it? Penny ante?

371
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,234
- Why?
- I just wondered.

372
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:40,778
Did he invite you to lunch,
or did you invite him?

373
00:31:40,862 --> 00:31:43,740
I don't want to offend you
but it's none of your business.

374
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:47,244
- I don't interfere in any of your affairs.
- I don't have any affairs.

375
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:50,580
- What do you mean?
- I don't think you could have a real affair.

376
00:31:50,872 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't think you could care for anyone.

377
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:56,378
I've been in love so many times,
my heart's calloused.

378
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:58,130
But I never had one with dough.

379
00:31:58,214 --> 00:32:01,801
This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way
to spend a pleasant afternoon.

380
00:32:02,844 --> 00:32:04,345
I don't agree with you.

381
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,140
All right, you raise the kids,
I'll raise the roof.

382
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:10,143
I'd rather die shaking cocktails
and bankers...

383
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:12,354
than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.

384
00:32:12,688 --> 00:32:13,814
Would you?

385
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:16,942
He can look like a gorilla
and have no manners...

386
00:32:16,984 --> 00:32:19,487
but he must have dough, plenty of dough.

387
00:32:22,156 --> 00:32:23,908
You think money is the only requisite.

388
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:26,536
It just happens that the poor people
are happier.

389
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:30,540
Then marry Ralph.
You'll be the happiest couple in the world.

390
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:32,709
I wish you wouldn't be
so sarcastic about him.

391
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:34,586
He's the sweetest kid I know.

392
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:38,257
What are you laughing at?

393
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,885
I just imagined you telling
a landlady some day...

394
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:43,638
you didn't have the rent,
but Ralph was awfully sweet.

395
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:46,808
I haven't noticed
any multi-millionaires running after you.

396
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,978
I met one last night.
All the money this side of Peoria.

397
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,314
- Did you? Where?
- ln the can.

398
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:56,235
The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy,
of the Park Avenue Wintons.

399
00:33:12,836 --> 00:33:14,671
- Discharge?
- Yeah.

400
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,973
How are you, Mr. Winton?

401
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:28,019
When I say I'm happier to see you
than I ever was to see anyone...

402
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:29,354
it comes from the heart.

403
00:33:29,437 --> 00:33:31,815
- How are you, Mr. Gates?
- Splendid, my boy.

404
00:33:31,898 --> 00:33:33,984
- What have you been up to?
- Not a thing.

405
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,445
- I hope your father accepts that.
- ls Dad here?

406
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,781
No. We talked to him long distance today.

407
00:33:38,864 --> 00:33:41,200
- Was he pretty sore?
- He wasn't exactly overjoyed.

408
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:42,326
What did he say?

409
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,039
He said to get you out of trouble,
then hire someone to punch your head off.

410
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:47,957
- Have you had lunch?
- No.

411
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,001
Come on, we'll get something to eat.

412
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:11,733
- Hello, Florence, how are you?
- Fine. Thanks.

413
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,069
I'm awfully sorry,
I've got to disappoint you.

414
00:34:14,194 --> 00:34:16,321
Don't worry. She'll get used to it.

415
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:18,657
Disappoint me? Why?

416
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:20,868
I won't be able to go to lunch with you.

417
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:22,078
What's happened?

418
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,914
The old man is awfully anxious
to open on schedule.

419
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:27,417
All of the advertising
announced it for tonight.

420
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:37,075
What are you doing here?
There are no visitors allowed.

421
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,037
- You'll have to leave.
- I'm from the Express.

422
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,165
I don't care where you're from.
I said, "No visitors allowed."

423
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:45,334
You might get some good publicity,
if you'll--

424
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:48,004
We're opening tonight.
You shall have the pleasure then.

425
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:50,048
You don't understand, if you....

426
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,050
Ralph.

427
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,803
Are you going to stay out there all day?

428
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,514
The old man's pretty peppery.
I'll see you tonight.

429
00:35:57,598 --> 00:35:58,599
All right.

430
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:02,144
I'm awfully sorry.
I was just explaining about....

431
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:15,075
- What's the matter, sir?
- Nothing at all, my boy.

432
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:18,495
I should like to meet your friend.

433
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,539
Why, certainly, sir.

434
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:25,169
Charlotte, Mr. Igor wants to meet you.

435
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:26,921
Why, certainly.

436
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,513
Mr. Igor, may I present my fiancée,
Miss Duncan.

437
00:36:34,763 --> 00:36:37,266
- Charlotte, Mr. Igor.
- I'm delighted to meet you.

438
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:39,435
- Professor Darcy.
- How do you do?

439
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:42,521
If you will forgive this poor,
crippled stump, my dear...

440
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:44,982
I am very happy to know you.

441
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:48,778
You'd be amused if I were to tell you
that I knew you before you were born.

442
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:52,616
Before this terrible thing
happened to me...

443
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,243
I made a very beautiful statue.

444
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:57,204
And, my child...

445
00:36:57,746 --> 00:37:00,708
you are that figure come to life.

446
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:02,668
How?

447
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:05,963
I wonder, sometime, would you pose
for one of my sculptors...

448
00:37:06,047 --> 00:37:08,257
who does really excellent work?

449
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:10,552
Why, yes, I'd love to.

450
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:12,220
Thank you.

451
00:37:45,172 --> 00:37:46,966
...see you tonight at the opening.

452
00:37:47,008 --> 00:37:50,094
- Of course, I plan to come.
- You'd be welcome at any time.

453
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:51,471
I crave nourishment.

454
00:37:51,554 --> 00:37:54,724
Come on, moonstruck. Let's get going.
So long, see you in jail.

455
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:57,436
- Good-bye, Mr. Igor.
- Good-bye. I'll see you tonight.

456
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,192
I assume I shall have the privilege
of having her pose for me.

457
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:06,195
- That was my plan.
- Thank you.

458
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,116
I'm going to leave you.
I've got to get to the office.

459
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,702
- But what about lunch?
- I'll have it for supper.

460
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:24,298
Hello, light of my life!

461
00:38:24,381 --> 00:38:26,801
Well, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?

462
00:38:26,884 --> 00:38:29,429
I want to see the original pictures
of Joan Gale.

463
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:33,516
Dig into the morgue and send up
all the art you have on Joan Gale.

464
00:38:34,184 --> 00:38:35,852
Why so mysterious? Spill it.

465
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:38,313
So you can tell me I'm wrong?
Don't be silly.

466
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,536
- Thanks.
- Okay.

467
00:38:51,703 --> 00:38:53,747
I am right! I know I'm right.

468
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,957
No one would suspect it.
You don't sound right.

469
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,043
If you wisecrack while I'm talking,
I'll crown you.

470
00:38:58,126 --> 00:38:59,878
Go ahead, wise guy. Spill it.

471
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,256
There's a wax museum opening
on 14th Street.

472
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,216
Don't that call for an extra.

473
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,010
I asked you to keep it shut.

474
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,930
You can't blame a guy
for getting breathless with that scoop.

475
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,099
You poor baboon, you can guess the rest.

476
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,309
Wait a minute.
No kidding. What's your idea?

477
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,604
I got a look at that dump a while ago...

478
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,690
and if they don't have a wax figure
of Joan Gale, then I'm crazy.

479
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:19,775
- We'll grant that.
- What?

480
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,443
What of it? Where do we go from there?

481
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,487
Does this mean anything to you?

482
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,740
Joan Gale's body was swiped
from the morgue.

483
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:28,117
Did you ever hear of such a thing
as a death mask?

484
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:29,869
I used to be married to one.

485
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:32,413
And it came to life and divorced you.
I know that.

486
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:35,750
My idea is this: Somebody swipes
the body, takes the impression...

487
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:39,171
makes a mold, produces a wax figure,
peddles it to the old skate there.

488
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:41,465
Work that up into a comic strip
and syndicate it.

489
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,008
- You go to....
- What's that?

490
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:44,093
Let it go.

491
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,721
Come down to earth.
Would they dare to do that?

492
00:39:46,804 --> 00:39:48,931
Wouldn't they know
it would be recognized?

493
00:39:49,015 --> 00:39:50,641
Shake your head, you'll be all right.

494
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:52,602
All right, mastermind.

495
00:39:55,355 --> 00:39:58,191
Something's cockeyed about that joint,
I'll find out what.

496
00:39:58,275 --> 00:40:00,986
By the way, another pet theory
of yours just blew up.

497
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:03,072
- What?
- That innocent Judge Ramsey...

498
00:40:03,155 --> 00:40:06,701
that you were sure got bumped off,
has been located in South America.

499
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:08,244
- No kidding?
- Almost certain.

500
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:12,081
I'll still bet I'm right,
and let you write your own ticket.

501
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:20,883
- That settles everything.
- Yup, everything settled.

502
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:21,925
Good.

503
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:26,055
- I'm glad they didn't hold you.
- There's no case against me.

504
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,683
A clumsy thing,
but nothing to worry about.

505
00:40:28,766 --> 00:40:32,353
- lf I can do anything for you....
- I know I can always depend on you.

506
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:35,774
- What do you think is the best time?
- I'll let you know.

507
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:37,692
- So long.
- See you later.

508
00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:39,820
- I hope, soon.
- Good-bye.

509
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,541
Hello?

510
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:55,044
Don't swoon. This is the voice of
the New York Express broadcasting.

511
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:56,838
I'm awful glad you phoned.

512
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:59,883
Thank you for trying
to cheer me up last night.

513
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:03,721
If you're grateful, you can prove it.
And do yourself a good turn too.

514
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:07,099
About 8:30 p. m., you be in your car at....

515
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:26,036
Good evening.

516
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:33,044
The history of these figures
becomes more interesting, perhaps...

517
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:36,131
when I tell you
that the originals were destroyed...

518
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:38,550
twelve years ago, in London, in a fire...

519
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:42,262
and were reproduced only after years
of arduous toil.

520
00:41:42,888 --> 00:41:47,476
To reproduce the figures destroyed,
I had to train men for years...

521
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,021
to do the work that I could no longer do.

522
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:52,774
The results, you see here tonight.

523
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:58,405
Ladies and gentlemen, here is
one of the classic examples of chivalry.

524
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:02,200
Sir Walter Raleigh,
spreading his cloak in the mud...

525
00:42:02,326 --> 00:42:04,912
so that Queen Elizabeth
might walk dry-shod.

526
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:10,251
This group represents
His Royal Highness, Le Duc D'Angouleme...

527
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:12,086
Ieader of the French nobility...

528
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,632
praying before the remains of the victims
of the Battle of Quiberon.

529
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:19,427
And next, we see
the ill-starred Maximilian...

530
00:42:19,678 --> 00:42:22,723
established as Emperor of Mexico
by Napoleon lll.

531
00:42:23,056 --> 00:42:25,434
Upon the conclusion
of the American Civil War...

532
00:42:25,517 --> 00:42:27,937
Napoleon withdrew his military support...

533
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,315
Ieaving Maximilian to the mercy
of his rebellious subjects.

534
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:35,445
The figure lying in the bath is Marat...

535
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:38,990
one of the most bloodthirsty
leaders of the French Revolution.

536
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:42,452
He perished at the hands
of his mistress Charlotte Corday...

537
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:46,290
who was inspired to the deed
by her fanatical devotion to her country.

538
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:50,753
This my friends, is Napoleon,
Emperor of the French...

539
00:42:50,836 --> 00:42:54,173
whose overwhelming ambition
swept him to world power.

540
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:58,136
Here we see him after his banishment
to St. Helena by the English.

541
00:42:58,303 --> 00:43:02,516
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
on the right here...

542
00:43:03,392 --> 00:43:06,311
we have a figure of Peter the Great.

543
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:08,939
- Hello, Ralph.
- Hello.

544
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:10,483
- Are we late?
- No.

545
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:13,569
- Pretty dress, have I seen it before?
- Yes, I think so.

546
00:43:13,653 --> 00:43:17,073
- Thank goodness that's settled.
- Pay no attention to her.

547
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:19,701
I'm so excited to see all these things.

548
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:42,309
- Mr. Igor.
- Yes?

549
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:48,148
You're sure of that? You're quite sure?

550
00:43:48,315 --> 00:43:51,360
- I'd know him anywhere.
- Keep track of him.

551
00:43:51,902 --> 00:43:54,280
This is the most important thing
of my life.

552
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:55,657
That'd be easy.

553
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:57,534
I wish....

554
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,836
- My little Marie Antoinette.
- Good evening, Mr. Igor.

555
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,340
- It's kind of you to be present.
- All these things are beautiful.

556
00:44:11,424 --> 00:44:12,383
They are.

557
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:16,721
- Too bad the audience was so poor.
- I wouldn't be too disappointed, Mr. Igor.

558
00:44:16,763 --> 00:44:19,641
The people are tired from the festivities.

559
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,601
My boy, I think you're right.

560
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:23,687
Everybody is tired out tonight.

561
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:27,065
And now that I've seen my doors open
in a new country...

562
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:30,194
I begin to realize I'm a little tired myself.

563
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:33,739
- Call that fellow in, I'll close up for tonight.
- Yes, sir.

564
00:44:35,908 --> 00:44:37,911
I might have felt a little discouraged.

565
00:44:37,994 --> 00:44:41,039
But now, everything seems
just as it should be.

566
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:46,086
You know, to find even one person who
appreciates my beautiful children here...

567
00:44:46,295 --> 00:44:48,756
- changes everything for me.
- I'm glad.

568
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,093
You're very beautiful.

569
00:44:52,677 --> 00:44:53,761
Thank you.

570
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:29,216
You must come sometime in the morning
when there is no crowd about...

571
00:45:29,883 --> 00:45:32,052
and I can give you more of my time.

572
00:45:33,804 --> 00:45:36,724
Good evening, Mr. Igor.
I've just been admiring your works.

573
00:45:36,808 --> 00:45:39,352
Properly lighted,
they're even more impressive.

574
00:45:39,435 --> 00:45:44,024
Yes. At first I despaired of ever achieving
the same results I did abroad...

575
00:45:44,357 --> 00:45:46,360
and then lighting came to my rescue.

576
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,737
I was particularly interested in that group.

577
00:45:48,821 --> 00:45:53,200
Yes, that one is very fine. Its grim tragedy
seems to fascinate everyone.

578
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:58,206
- Yes, and that other one, that Joan of Arc.
- That was the most recently completed.

579
00:45:58,373 --> 00:46:00,583
- lt arrived this morning.
- You did that yourself?

580
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:05,005
No. Never since these hands were burned
have I created anything.

581
00:46:05,046 --> 00:46:08,133
- I only direct the work of others.
- Who did it?

582
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:09,635
Professor Darcy.

583
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:13,848
- He has been my hands for years.
- You are very generous, Mr. Igor.

584
00:46:13,931 --> 00:46:17,852
But I don't deserve any credit.
I only carried out your instructions.

585
00:46:18,227 --> 00:46:19,354
Good night.

586
00:46:31,992 --> 00:46:34,245
It's getting late. I better be going.

587
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:36,038
- Good night.
- Good night.

588
00:46:36,247 --> 00:46:38,041
- Shall we go?
- All right.

589
00:46:38,124 --> 00:46:40,376
Thank you for coming.
Good night, my dear.

590
00:46:40,418 --> 00:46:42,253
- Good night.
- Ready, Florence?

591
00:46:42,337 --> 00:46:44,840
You two go without me. I've got a date.

592
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:46,717
No fouling in the clinches!

593
00:46:55,017 --> 00:46:56,978
Winton!

594
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:05,570
Follow that man down the street!
And no questions.

595
00:47:05,654 --> 00:47:07,656
We're on the trail of hot news.

596
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:46,239
- What's this all about?
- I might as well tell you.

597
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,159
That man is connected
with the robbery at the morgue.

598
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:52,246
I don't want anything
to do with this matter.

599
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:55,916
- Even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
- Not even then.

600
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,088
The police should handle this. If you've
suspicions we'll go to the police.

601
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:03,466
And let every rag in town
grab a red-hot story?

602
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,012
- Drive me around the corner and wait.
- I don't want to mix in this.

603
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:10,098
Then you can go to a warm place,
and I don't mean California.

604
00:48:10,182 --> 00:48:13,811
- All right. What do you want me to do?
- I told you what to do.

605
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:17,899
Drive out of sight of the house.
I want to get a closer look at the place.

606
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:24,489
That's nonsense.

607
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:28,243
- I figure you're yellow.
- No, I'm not.

608
00:48:28,368 --> 00:48:31,955
- I feel that someone's been watching me.
- Nobody's watching you.

609
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:34,416
You're yellow and your nerves are shot.

610
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,044
I'll do nothing to help you
until it's delivered.

611
00:48:37,128 --> 00:48:39,797
- Get that through your head.
- All right.

612
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:42,383
- I'll phone.
- Not on this phone, you fool.

613
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:44,219
Go outside and call.

614
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,304
All right.

615
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,949
Well, buddy, what's the stall?

616
00:51:39,742 --> 00:51:42,537
- I'm waiting for someone.
- Yeah, for who?

617
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:46,040
- I don't think it concerns you.
- Cut out the bluffing.

618
00:51:46,124 --> 00:51:50,170
We've been following you,
and you've done very suspicious things.

619
00:51:50,253 --> 00:51:52,714
- Now, what are you doing here?
- What have I done?

620
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:55,843
You had a visitor at your apartment
this afternoon.

621
00:51:55,926 --> 00:51:58,929
Not the kind of a person
I'd expect you to entertain.

622
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:01,432
Winton!

623
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:08,732
- Hello, Express.
- I found the body!

624
00:52:08,815 --> 00:52:11,485
- What are you talking about?
- The body of Joan Gale!

625
00:52:11,568 --> 00:52:13,153
Trying to outsmart the police?

626
00:52:13,236 --> 00:52:16,824
The body of Joan Gale is packed in the box
in the basement!

627
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:25,458
- Are you giving me this straight?
- Take a look for yourself.

628
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:26,918
Let's take a look.

629
00:52:29,462 --> 00:52:30,839
You, stop!

630
00:52:30,964 --> 00:52:34,384
You cover the house, I'll get the other bird.
Come on.

631
00:52:50,986 --> 00:52:52,279
Open this door.

632
00:52:55,866 --> 00:52:57,117
Take it easy.

633
00:52:58,035 --> 00:53:00,996
- It's down there in the basement.
- Wait a minute.

634
00:53:05,835 --> 00:53:08,046
You boys go upstairs.

635
00:53:20,184 --> 00:53:23,271
- It's not here, it's in the basement.
- Keep quiet.

636
00:53:23,354 --> 00:53:25,064
Let's have a little light.

637
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:29,319
- See what's in there.
- Yes, sir.

638
00:53:30,904 --> 00:53:33,490
Can you give me a description
of this person you saw?

639
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:36,994
Not a very good one, I guess.
It wasn't like anything human.

640
00:53:37,202 --> 00:53:39,371
It hobbled and swayed like a monkey.

641
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:43,167
And the face, from the glimpse I got
of it was like an African war mask.

642
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:45,253
- You mean he was colored?
- I don't know.

643
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:48,173
But he made Frankenstein look like a lily!

644
00:53:49,048 --> 00:53:51,509
- Nothing in there.
- ls there a rear entrance?

645
00:53:51,551 --> 00:53:53,970
- I couldn't find any.
- Let's take a look.

646
00:53:57,141 --> 00:53:59,143
Look, that's the basement.

647
00:54:01,812 --> 00:54:05,441
- You find anything upstairs?
- Just a lot of paper and junk.

648
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:09,737
See if you can find a back entrance.
Let's take a look at the basement.

649
00:54:09,821 --> 00:54:11,197
Just a minute, you.

650
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,245
- This is the place.
- Shut up!

651
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,206
Come out of there.

652
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:21,083
There's no one in here.

653
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:26,964
There he is now.

654
00:54:34,931 --> 00:54:36,391
Turn on that light.

655
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:42,189
There it is. You'll find
the body of Joan Gale in this box.

656
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:45,568
- Get that hatchet and open this.
- Yes, sir.

657
00:54:54,286 --> 00:54:57,664
- I don't want to see it.
- Stay where you are.

658
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,417
What I wouldn't give for a slug of gin.

659
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,111
So that's your corpse?

660
00:55:25,194 --> 00:55:26,946
Of all the things!

661
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:30,950
There's your corpse.

662
00:55:38,375 --> 00:55:41,253
I've done nothing.
You've no right to arrest me!

663
00:55:41,754 --> 00:55:44,090
- What's the charge against me?
- Shut up.

664
00:55:44,256 --> 00:55:45,383
Here it is.

665
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:49,095
Come here.

666
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:53,099
Come on, spill it.
Who is it that owns this layout?

667
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:56,603
- I don't know.
- You don't know anything about it?

668
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,273
No, sir. I just know
there was man named Worth.

669
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,358
- Worth?
- Yes, that was his name.

670
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:05,321
That's my bootlegger's name!
A heavyset fellow, with a broken nose?

671
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,240
Yes, that was the man.

672
00:56:07,532 --> 00:56:11,035
I hope he delivered the stuff
I paid him for this afternoon.

673
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,580
I told you it was a bootlegger
you saw at my place.

674
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:15,499
- Take this fellow in.
- I've done nothing.

675
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:18,961
- I even refused to deliver stuff for him.
- Come on, let's go.

676
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:21,296
Are you trying to give us
the runaround here?

677
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,133
I want two of you boys
to work the outside.

678
00:56:24,175 --> 00:56:26,010
Don't let anybody in or out.

679
00:56:31,057 --> 00:56:33,351
Florence, I don't want to leave her--

680
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:35,896
What're you doing? Put it back!

681
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:38,982
No, this is my percentage.
You guys are going to get yours.

682
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,150
I found this dump.

683
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:42,152
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

684
00:57:11,684 --> 00:57:14,729
- Junkie?
- Yes, peddling.

685
00:57:15,313 --> 00:57:17,023
Hold up your hands.

686
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:25,491
A classy turnip. Must have dipped it.

687
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:28,661
They tell me
your managing editor is poison.

688
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:31,205
It takes a sturdy person to look at him.

689
00:57:31,956 --> 00:57:35,418
The season's best catch is waiting.
I guess I'll breeze.

690
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:37,879
Wait a minute.

691
00:57:39,298 --> 00:57:41,550
You want to talk to that junkie, Captain?

692
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:44,678
No, it's all right.
Lock him up. He'll talk soon.

693
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:47,223
- What do you think this is?
- What?

694
00:57:47,473 --> 00:57:50,727
- Looks like a watch.
- Yes, but do you know whose watch?

695
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:54,939
- We don't know anything about it.
- Judge Ramsey's. That's all.

696
00:58:02,072 --> 00:58:05,034
- Where did you get it?
- Took it off the junkie.

697
00:58:05,451 --> 00:58:07,203
Well, I'll be....

698
00:58:09,914 --> 00:58:13,334
- Bring him in. Here's your chance.
- Oh, boy!

699
00:58:15,629 --> 00:58:16,588
Come in.

700
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:22,219
That yours?

701
00:59:25,704 --> 00:59:28,541
Wait. Get me to the office and step on it.

702
00:59:42,556 --> 00:59:45,100
- You like taking chances, don't you?
- Why?

703
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:48,187
- You go in for dangerous things.
- Darned if I don't!

704
00:59:48,604 --> 00:59:51,440
Slow down!
I said the office, not the cemetery!

705
00:59:51,774 --> 00:59:55,445
I never knew there were women like you
in the world. You're game and decent.

706
00:59:55,528 --> 00:59:59,658
And so determined to live that I'll take
a taxi if you don't watch where you go.

707
00:59:59,825 --> 01:00:02,536
I've only known you 24 hours,
but I'm in love with you.

708
01:00:02,578 --> 01:00:04,705
Doesn't usually take that long.
I forgive you.

709
01:00:04,747 --> 01:00:06,582
You were in a tough spot when we met.

710
01:00:06,624 --> 01:00:09,627
- No, I'm crazy about you.
- That's what caused it?

711
01:00:10,962 --> 01:00:14,382
You don't believe me. You think
I'm just talking. Will you marry me?

712
01:00:14,465 --> 01:00:17,761
- How much money have you got?
- Heaven knows. A lot.

713
01:00:17,802 --> 01:00:20,972
That being the case, I'll take it up
with the board of directors.

714
01:00:21,056 --> 01:00:22,933
Listen, aviator. Here we are.

715
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:29,857
Hold everything, I'll be right back.

716
01:00:36,114 --> 01:00:38,783
- Mitt me, kid. I've got a classic.
- You here again...

717
01:00:38,867 --> 01:00:41,036
Iike an evil spirit to mar my happiness.

718
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,580
I've got a story,
but I won't tell you what it is.

719
01:00:43,622 --> 01:00:46,583
- Every time I tell you, it goes haywire.
- What do you mean?

720
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:50,129
You start out after murderers and
bring back three-for-a-dime bootleggers.

721
01:00:50,212 --> 01:00:52,965
You start out to solve murders
and break up crap games.

722
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:56,010
You're stupendous. I'm for you.
You're wonderful.

723
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:59,306
You're always razzing everything I do,
but this time I'm in.

724
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:02,726
Go on, girl. Tell your troubles to a cop.
I don't feel like talking.

725
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:04,311
Is there any art on Judge Ramsey?

726
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:07,731
Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey
of stealing the body.

727
01:01:07,982 --> 01:01:10,526
I'm gonna make you eat dirt,
you soap bubble.

728
01:01:10,609 --> 01:01:13,488
I'm gonna make you beg for somebody
to help you let go!

729
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:15,865
You may be the world to your mother
but you're a....

730
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:23,832
Let's get them some coffee, they've been
in there with that junkie all night.

731
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,001
Go on, talk.

732
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,922
You found that watch in a taxicab
three months ago. Is that right?

733
01:01:30,172 --> 01:01:33,384
Yes, sir. I got in the cab
and it was laying there on the floor.

734
01:01:33,468 --> 01:01:36,095
Where were you going
when you got in that cab?

735
01:01:36,846 --> 01:01:38,848
I don't remember. Not very far.

736
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:42,561
- You remember what day that was?
- No, sir. About three months ago.

737
01:01:42,644 --> 01:01:45,522
- Remember what kind of a cab it was?
- No, sir, just a cab.

738
01:01:45,564 --> 01:01:49,568
- Didn't happen to be going to Worth's?
- No, sir. I'm sure it wasn't there.

739
01:01:49,652 --> 01:01:53,656
You used to go to Worth's place a lot.
What makes you sure it wasn't there?

740
01:01:53,739 --> 01:01:56,743
Well, maybe, it was. I don't remember.

741
01:01:58,411 --> 01:02:02,040
You've got to do something for me.
I can't stand it anymore.

742
01:02:02,082 --> 01:02:04,209
I can't! Please.

743
01:02:13,135 --> 01:02:15,722
He's beginning to break.
He'll talk pretty soon.

744
01:02:15,805 --> 01:02:18,975
I think we got him, Chief.
He's been begging all night.

745
01:02:19,642 --> 01:02:22,270
I never saw a junkie hold out so long.

746
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:49,383
Ralph?

747
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,710
I beg your pardon. Is Ralph here?

748
01:03:39,062 --> 01:03:40,814
I was looking for Ralph.

749
01:03:48,113 --> 01:03:49,114
No!

750
01:03:49,573 --> 01:03:51,992
Mr. Igor, I'm so glad you're here.

751
01:03:52,576 --> 01:03:55,621
I don't know why
but I was a little bit afraid.

752
01:03:55,663 --> 01:03:58,666
Afraid? Poor Hugo is quite harmless.

753
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:03,588
My little friend, you've honored me
by accepting my invitation of last night.

754
01:04:03,672 --> 01:04:05,966
No, I wanted to speak to Ralph.

755
01:04:06,466 --> 01:04:10,220
We had a silly little argument last night,
and I said something unkind--

756
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,890
Oh, you children. You happy children.

757
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,561
You've quarreled,
and now you'll be friends again.

758
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,605
That's exactly as it should be.

759
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,858
Never let any stupid misunderstanding
come between you.

760
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,362
- lt was really all my fault.
- Let him think it was his fault.

761
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:30,159
You must be stern with him before you
forgive him, especially if it was your fault.

762
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,123
Now I understand
why he was so gloomy this morning.

763
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:39,043
- Then he's here?
- Yes, down in the workroom.

764
01:04:39,419 --> 01:04:42,839
- I'll call him for you.
- No, please, don't bother.

765
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:47,219
- I think it'd be better if I surprise him.
- As you wish, my child.

766
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:51,015
- Just go straight ahead.
- All right, thanks.

767
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:19,379
Ralph?

768
01:06:15,356 --> 01:06:16,941
Ralph, are you there?

769
01:07:02,824 --> 01:07:04,659
What's the matter, my child?

770
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:07,871
Are you frightened?

771
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:10,749
I thought you said Ralph was here.

772
01:07:10,832 --> 01:07:14,545
I came to tell you that I was mistaken.
I've sent Otto to find him.

773
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:20,593
I hope this little glimpse behind the scenes
will interest you.

774
01:07:20,676 --> 01:07:23,179
This is the birthplace of all my creations.

775
01:07:24,347 --> 01:07:25,724
Let me show you.

776
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:28,935
I don't want to put you
to the trouble, Mr. Igor.

777
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:31,522
No trouble at all, my child.

778
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:35,609
This is the strange, vicarious pleasure
that remains for me.

779
01:07:35,943 --> 01:07:38,738
To see others enjoy the beauty
I used to create.

780
01:07:41,115 --> 01:07:44,285
- My footing is none too secure.
- Please, let me help you.

781
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:45,704
Help me, my dear...

782
01:07:46,746 --> 01:07:49,249
you'll help me to give back to the world...

783
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:51,126
my masterpiece.

784
01:08:00,303 --> 01:08:01,637
Marie Antoinette.

785
01:08:06,893 --> 01:08:07,894
No!

786
01:08:17,613 --> 01:08:19,615
Hey, you. Wait a minute.

787
01:08:20,157 --> 01:08:23,953
- You can't park here. Get it out of here.
- Okay, brother.

788
01:08:24,037 --> 01:08:28,291
- I have to park the car. I'll be right back.
- Make it snappy, I might need you.

789
01:08:39,553 --> 01:08:41,639
- Hey, Ralph!
- Hello, Florence.

790
01:08:41,722 --> 01:08:44,475
- Gee, am I glad to see you.
- First time you've said that.

791
01:08:44,517 --> 01:08:46,728
- Have you got a key?
- I just came down to open up.

792
01:08:46,811 --> 01:08:49,231
- What are you doing here?
- After news, as usual.

793
01:08:49,314 --> 01:08:51,984
What are the chances for me
to slip in and look around?

794
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:54,236
You better wait
until the old man gets here.

795
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,616
I'll tell you a secret. I like the old gent.
I'm doing a special Sunday magazine--

796
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:01,327
- I don't think I can--
- lt might help him a whole lot.

797
01:09:01,369 --> 01:09:05,206
The old man was depressed at the opening
last night. This might cheer him up.

798
01:09:06,332 --> 01:09:07,292
Hurry up.

799
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,961
Thanks.

800
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:41,287
All right. I'll talk. I'll tell you what I know!

801
01:09:41,454 --> 01:09:44,248
Ramsey was murdered
because he looked like Voltaire.

802
01:09:44,332 --> 01:09:46,876
Do you hear?
Because he looked like Voltaire.

803
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:51,339
You want to know what became of him!
He's a statue. A silly wax statue.

804
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:54,301
You killed him!
Come on with the rest of it.

805
01:09:55,219 --> 01:09:57,888
No, I did not.
It was lgor at the Wax Museum.

806
01:09:57,972 --> 01:10:00,224
You were in on it. You worked for him.

807
01:10:00,307 --> 01:10:03,060
The only thing I did
was keep track of a man named Worth.

808
01:10:03,144 --> 01:10:06,064
- He runs the place where you arrested me.
- You lie!

809
01:10:06,356 --> 01:10:09,192
No. It was lgor at the Wax Museum.

810
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:11,528
You'll find your judge embalmed in wax!

811
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:14,490
He's a statue of Voltaire,
with the other corpses!

812
01:10:14,656 --> 01:10:18,202
I tell you, the whole place is a morgue.
Do you hear? A morgue.

813
01:10:19,662 --> 01:10:22,498
My child, why are you so pitifully afraid?

814
01:10:22,707 --> 01:10:26,211
Immortality has been the dream,
the inspiration of mankind for ages.

815
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:28,755
I am going to give you immortality.

816
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:31,216
Please, I haven't done anything
to hurt you.

817
01:10:31,258 --> 01:10:34,720
I have no desire to hurt you.
You will always be beautiful.

818
01:10:34,761 --> 01:10:39,225
Think, my child, in a thousand years,
you will be as lovely as you are now.

819
01:10:39,308 --> 01:10:40,643
- Come.
- No!

820
01:10:41,102 --> 01:10:43,104
Let me go!

821
01:11:00,331 --> 01:11:01,749
Your face...

822
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,544
was of wax.

823
01:11:05,545 --> 01:11:08,173
- You fiend.
- My Marie Antoinette.

824
01:11:09,716 --> 01:11:12,803
- You must not say that to me.
- You fiend!

825
01:11:13,387 --> 01:11:17,224
There was a fiend, of that you can be sure.
There was a fiend.

826
01:11:17,433 --> 01:11:19,643
And this is what he did to me.

827
01:11:27,944 --> 01:11:30,071
You did this.

828
01:11:32,157 --> 01:11:35,619
For 12 years, 12 awful years...

829
01:11:36,411 --> 01:11:38,747
this terrible living dead man...

830
01:11:39,248 --> 01:11:42,418
with these burned hands and face
has searched for the fiend.

831
01:11:42,501 --> 01:11:44,337
Now the account is closed.

832
01:11:49,008 --> 01:11:50,385
He is here!

833
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:04,275
Charlotte!

834
01:13:32,662 --> 01:13:34,664
Don't be afraid, my dear.

835
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:37,751
In a few minutes,
the container will have filled with wax.

836
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:41,630
And when it overflows,
your beauty will be preserved forever.

837
01:14:03,988 --> 01:14:06,032
Here, go down there quickly.

838
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:17,336
- I'm getting out of here.
- We'll go down there and help them.

839
01:14:17,377 --> 01:14:19,797
- What can I do?
- I don't know, we must do something!

840
01:14:40,694 --> 01:14:42,446
Come on, boys. This is it.

841
01:14:42,529 --> 01:14:44,365
They're down there. Quick!

842
01:14:55,377 --> 01:14:56,878
Through the center.

843
01:15:03,052 --> 01:15:04,261
Try it again.

844
01:15:14,773 --> 01:15:16,274
Stop where you are!

845
01:16:22,387 --> 01:16:24,098
Take them away!

846
01:16:26,434 --> 01:16:30,480
- You've got the other papers bleeding.
- Now I'm going to scramble this egg.

847
01:16:37,404 --> 01:16:41,533
- Now, Poison lvy, was that a story?
- You had a million dollars worth of luck.

848
01:16:41,617 --> 01:16:45,538
Listen, stupid, could I do anything
that would meet with your approval?

849
01:16:45,621 --> 01:16:49,083
You could. Cut out this crazy business
and act like a lady. Marry me.

850
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:51,461
- Marry you?
- That's what I said.

851
01:16:58,635 --> 01:17:01,179
I'm gonna get even with you,
you dirty stiff.

852
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,848
I'll do it.
