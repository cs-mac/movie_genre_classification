00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,357
Dr. Weiss says
that it's perfectly normal

2
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,356
to dream about it again
from time to time.

3
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,070
I mean, after all,
dreams are one way

4
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,740
that our minds deal
with frightening experiences.

5
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,782
I know.

6
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,153
See, what's why Valerie-

7
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,413
That's why Dr. Weiss says

8
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:38,037
that your sister has problems,
you see.

9
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,326
She's never been able
to release her-

10
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,252
I know.
He told me all about it.

11
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,127
Thanks.

12
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,388
Do you want me
to make an appointment?

13
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,306
Maybe you should talk to him.

14
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,508
Morn, I'm okay.

15
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,013
It was just
the same old dream.

16
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,497
<i>Courtney, you're
gonna be late for school.</i>

17
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,746
Coming!

18
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,306
Are you sure you're all right?

19
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,807
Mom, I'm fine.

20
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,142
I really am.

21
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,720
You be careful now, okay?

22
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,646
Remember I love you.

23
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,808
I love you, too.

00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,233

A dead bird.

31
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,738
Ugh. You are so weird sometimes.

32
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,700
Is your mom still buggin' you
about your makeup and stuff?

33
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,962
She just picks
on the weirdest little things.

34
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,547
Man, sometimes I wish
she would just-

35
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,167
Fall into a black hole?

36
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,626
Yeah.

37
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,884

Matt Arbicost.
Isn't he the one you like?

51
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,442
Well, yeah, we had lunch
a couple of times.

52
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,317
Oh, God. Talk to him, Courtney.
He likes you.

53
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,656
He told Darcy Williams
he thought you were cute.

54
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,617
- Really?
- Yes! Hi, Matt.

Hi. How's it going"?

Fine. How are you?

All right for a school day.
You doing anything after class?

Um-.

59

We're practicing with our band.

Sheila Barrington,

You should come over.
It's a lot of fun.

And last night,
he was in bed with me.

I think you should have
some juice, have some toast,

and you'll feel a lot better
after you eat something.

Last night, in my dream,
he killed Valerie.

I could feel him breathe on me.

429
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,209
You know, I read
a doctor's report once

430
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,666
about something called
subconscious projection.

431
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:19,511
He kissed me and it was real.

432
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,387
Courtney, it's the kind
of dream you have

433
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,714
when you drink too much.

434

00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:17,038
Courtney should go see a shrink
if she can't loosen up.

645
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,407
Would you guys chill out?
Please?

646
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,122
<i>God.</i>

647
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,720
I'm not crazy.

648
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,517
I'm not. I saw it.

649
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,265
And I heard him laughing.

650
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,270
He's in this house somewhere.

651
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:54,071
Courtney, it's okay.
I believe you saw something.

652
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,162
Have any of you heard anything

653
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,244
or seen anybody else strange
around here?

654
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,199
No.

655
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,543
Only Courtney.

656
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,245
Very funny.

657
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,631
Now, where is Sally?

658
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,835
I've looked all over for her
and I don't know where she is.

659
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,882
Great, man.

660
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,008
Oh, fuck you.

661
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,183
She probably
just went to the store.

662
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,430
All the cars are still here, T.J.

663
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,846
This is getting too stupid.

664
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,519
For once in your life, T.J.,
won't you just shut up?

665
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:26,686
God.

666
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,895
I mean, maybe, just maybe...

667
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,105
there is a psycho
running around here.

668
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,820
Courtney, why don't you
go lie down?

669
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,281
Okay?

670
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,656
I'm gonna go call the cops.

671
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,163
Oh, God. Anybody got any tranqs?

672
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,382
Who turned on
the trash compactor?

673
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,300
Well, I don't know. It was-

674
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,090
It was on when we came in here.

675
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,756
Probably just some old bones.

676
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,977
<i>Now, let me
get this straight.</i>

677
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,110
You saw Sally's face
explode in the bathroom,

678
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:16,025
but you haven't seen her since,
dead or alive.

679
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,236
And you think that she's
in the trash compactor,

680
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,243
but you're afraid to look,
right?

681
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,707
Yes.

682
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,623
When did this happen?

683
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,339
Uh, about three hours ago.

684
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:32,756
Did you see her?

685
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,047
Was her face intact?

686
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,920
Well, the last time I saw her
was about two o'clock,

687
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,301
but she was okay then.

688
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,139
No!

689
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,437
Go away, you're supposed
to be dead.

690
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,061
Is this Sally Burns?

691
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:52,526
Yes.

692
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,570
Christ, where have you been?

693
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:58,358
Uh, I just went to the store
to get some more Oxy 10

694
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,286
and, well,
I- I met this outrageous guy.

695
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:08,327
He was such a babe and, um, I-

696
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,999
Did I do something wrong?

697
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,005
You freaked out your
little friends here.

698
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:16,505
And you wasted about 200 dollars
of the taxpayers' money,

699
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,503
but you didn't do
anything wrong.

700
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:19,962
Ladies and gentlemen,

701
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,849
I don't know what kind of drugs
this one is on and I don't care,

702
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,597
because I don't wanna have
to deal with

703
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,138
her mother and father
and the fancy lawyers.

704
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,765
But I'll tell you brats
somethin':

705
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:34,812
If you jerk my chain in my town
I'll rip your lungs out.

706
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,399
Come on, Krueger.
Denny's is holding our booth.

707
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,233
I'm on my way.

708
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,487
Y'all have a nice day.

709
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,459
- What is the matter with-?
- I don't know. Courtney just-

710
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,792
Courtney needs some time alone.

711
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:03,556
I'm sorry. I'm- I'm sorry.
I must be just goin' crazy.

712
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,600
Do you wanna go home?

713
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,519
No, right now I just-

714
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,847
I'm so tired I just don't wanna
do anything.

715
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:11,851
Okay?

716
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,022
Matt, we're gonna go get
something to eat. Okay?

717
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:16,569
Yeah, we're starved too, huh?

718
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,362
All right.

719
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,235
I think we need to stay here.

720
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,442
- Let's go.
- Come on.

721
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,074
<i>H'</i>

722
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,452
Ready for a surprise dessert?

723
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,250
<i>Dessert?</i>

724
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,215
Happy Birthday, Courtney.

725
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,542
<i>Wow!</i>

726
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:41,840
I'd sing Happy Birthday to you

727
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,379
but my singing
would gross you out.

728
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,136
It's beautiful.

729
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,555
Thank you.

730
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,145
Gotta take a big breath.

731
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,599
No, I'm just gonna look at it
for a while.

732
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:55,899
It's too pretty.

733
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:59,145
Aren't you gonna make a wish?

734
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,071
I've already got my wish.

735
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,001
Hey. Hey, this is supposed
to cheer you up.

736
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,339
Matt, I don't know if I'm
going crazy or what.

737
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,167
You must think I am
the weirdest person

738
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,501
in the whole world.

739
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:27,382
No. No, I think you're a very
sensitive person,

740
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,767
but something bad happened
to you when you were little

741
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,058
and all the excitement
from your crazy friends

742
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,684
brought it back
a little while today.

743
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,146
You know what happened
at the Cravens'?

744
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,101
Yeah.

745
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,358
The Cravens are really
good friends with my parents.

746
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,782
And I know you and your sister
helped kill the murderer

747
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,108
and that's a really heavy trip.

748
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,027
Yeah, and he's dead.

749
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,074
Isn't he?

750
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,447
Yeah, they're dead.

751
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,763
I know, I know.

752
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,801
Hey, I have musical ability.

753
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,223
T.J., show them-

754
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,191

00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:42,899
Does it?

00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,276

I don't know.

792
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,936
I was dreamin' about him

00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,351
and then all of a sudden
he was there killing Matt.

I know, I know, I know.
It's okay.

795
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,607
He was there and he was real.

00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:57,693
All right, that's it.

797
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,027
