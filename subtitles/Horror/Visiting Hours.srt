00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,244
Janet Macklyn was discovered with
contusions, a mild concussion, a

2
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,368
ruptured eardrum.

3
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,589
Wouldn't you say that these were
indications that she was a battered

4
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,252
wife?

5
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,047
-Or someone made to look that way.
-By whom?

6
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,339
Herself.

7
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,384
In other words, she
shot her husband and

8
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,507
then threw herself down
the stairs to make

9
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,099
it look like self defense.

10
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,259
Perhaps.

11
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,096
You're a very gifted
lawyer, Mr. Holstrom.

12
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,305
Thank you.

13
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,024
Only a very gifted lawyer
could convince

14
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,394
a jury that Janet Macklyn, without

15
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:27,899
provocation, assaulted and severely
crippled her husband for life.

16
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,656
Ms. Ballin, try to imagine
yourself in court.

not that abridged

18
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,289

19
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,534
I have read the complete text.

20
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,996
And isn't it a hard fact

21
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,215
that Janet Macklyn's husband
could have attacked her first?

22
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,677
Her counsel pleaded self
defense and lost the case.

23
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,766
Her counsel was a 26-year-old public
defender fresh out of law school.

24
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,929
He passed the bar.

25
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,057
Last year, this was his
second case, but when

26
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,305
What the hell's she doing?

May I warn you that you are just
on this side of being libelous?

30
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,610
-Jesus Christ.
-Wouldn't you say that it would be

31
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,701
more ethical to move the
trial to a different town?

Would you be prepared to discuss the
case next week with her new lawyer?

35
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,660
I didn't know she had one.

36
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,788
Yes, as of 3:15 this
afternoon, William

37
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,086
Craff Davies has accepted this case.

38
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,303
A fund has been started for
her defense, to which, uh,

39
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,048
I, for one, would be the
first to contribute.

40
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,138
Are you nuts? Huh?

41
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,937
-Listen, I feel good about what I did.
-You put that bastard on trial.

42
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,434
He should be on trial.

43
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,186
Your job is not to take sides.

44

What is my job? All
that I did-- All that I

45
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,029
did was to give somebody

[QUIET CONVERSATION]

636
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:38,209
You love to talk, talk, talk.
Well, you're going to listen.

637
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:41,330
You're gonna listen to me.
You wanted me to make it?

638
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:48,129
You never listen. You're talking all
the time. You're gonna listen to me.

639
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,681
Feel me? Feel this? Huh?

640
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:58,271
Oh. No, you don't.

641

[SHOUTING]

642
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:26,082
What is all this?

643
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:27,875
Where is he?

644
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:29,669
Oh, hasn't he been
put through enough?

645
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,462
-Where's your warrant?
-Where is he?

646
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:34,506
-We'll take care of this.
-He hurt himself.

647
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:36,470
We had to call an ambulance.

648
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:36,883
What?

649
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,134
Yeah. They took him to
County General Hospital.

650
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:43,762
Come on! Let's go, let's go!

651
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:26,396
We've got fractured ribs. I
need a chest X-ray, now.

652
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:28,810
It's locked up tighter than
the Vatican down there.

653
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:29,807
Not even any cops.

654
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:31,935
Well get Grayson to open
it. She needs X-rays.

655
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:32,902
Okay, let's go.

656
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,985
Technician's having coffee.
Get him, fast.

657
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:27,073
I saw them sealing off
the second floor.

658
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:29,451
They must be working
their way down.

659
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:40,503
No!

660
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:46,559
No!

661
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,003
Hey. What are you doing here?

662
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:03,587
Get help. Call a security guard. Go.

663
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:51,843
Here.

664
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:55,897
Here.
