1
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:27,492
I can't hold her much longer.
She's taking on too much water.

2
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:33,288
- What is going on back there?
- Keep your pants on, Murphy.

3
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:40,044
We blew the starboard engine.
Port engine's way too hot.

4
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:43,213
- Hold on.
- Shorten the tow or cut her loose.

5
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:44,381
Epps...

6
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:48,509
<i>... get off my damn tugboat.
We don't have much time.</i>

7
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,472
<i>Move it, Epps. If she sinks,
she's taking us with her.</i>

8
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,103
Got a punch in the port floater.

9
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:05,272
<i>- Five minutes before she floods.
- Less than that!</i>

10
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:07,983
Get back here.
We're cutting her loose.

11
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,734
- Cut her loose.
- That's it. Get back here.

12
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:12,695
Come on! You heard the man!

13
00:06:12,945 --> 00:06:18,866
Took us three months to get her off
the bottom. I will not lose her now!

14
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:21,994
Goddamn it, Epps!
You can't fix everything!

15
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:25,204
Christ!

16
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,504
<i>- For the last time, get back here!
- She's taking on too much water!</i>

17
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,468
<i>Why do you always have to break
my balls? I said get back here!</i>

18
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:51,184
<i>Do you want me to come down there
and kick your ass? Because I'll do it.</i>

19
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:59,565
Here's to the best damn
salvage crew in the business!

20
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:03,276
- We did it, guys!
- Yeah, look at that!

21
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:07,863
All right. Nice work.

22
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:12,909
- Here's to the fucking sea!
- To the sea.

23
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:17,954
To a job well done.

24
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:23,000
Mr. Murphy? I'm Jack Ferriman. I was
wondering if I could buy you a drink.

25
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,836
He doesn't drink.

26
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:32,049
Could I talk to you alone?

27
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:37,595
You talk to me, you talk to my crew.
That's the way it is.

28
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:42,349
I fly the Arctic Weather Patrol flights
out of Mackenzie Bay.

29
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,103
Last month I was out in the middle
of the Strait when I came across this.

30
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:51,773
Congratulations. You found a boat.

31
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:55,275
In the middle of the ocean,
of all places.

32
00:07:55,526 --> 00:07:58,612
I tried for radio contact
and got nothing...

33
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:01,823
...so I figured she had to be adrift.

34
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:03,574
In the Bering Strait?

35
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:07,160
That's miles from shipping lanes.
Did you alert the Coast Guard?

36
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,372
It's international waters,
so they noted it and that's it.

37
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:12,998
You get a name?

38
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:17,585
No, I put it out of my head until
two days ago when I saw it again.

39
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:21,171
What are we talking about?
What kind of tonnage?

40
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:25,466
Big. Huge.
Could be military.

41
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:29,344
Let's say that we're
a little bit interested.

42
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:31,847
What's in it for you?

43
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:35,850
I want 20% finder's fee,
whatever she's worth.

44
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,980
- Have you told anyone else about this?
- Not a living soul.

45
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:47,734
- Give us a minute, will you?
- Okay.

46
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:50,653
So? What do you think, Murph?

47
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:53,738
Who knows? Could be full of shit.

48
00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:58,200
I do know one thing. I've seen strange
things happen in the Strait.

49
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,495
I know something else:
Sea gives you an opportunity, take it.

50
00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:07,708
That's at least a week out of our way.
We've been out for six months already.

51
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:12,253
I got a fiancée waiting, remember?
I'm getting married in a month.

52
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:16,631
Plan was to go back to Anchorage.
Starboard diesel needs an overhaul.

53
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:21,219
- In our business, the only plan is:
- There is no plan.

54
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:26,556
If you don't want to go, that's fine.
Let's tell him we'll get somebody else.

55
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:32,895
Wait a minute. Let's not be hasty.
What's a ship like that worth?

56
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:34,229
Who knows?

57
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,066
Millions? Thousands? Could be nothing.
Depends on a lot of things.

58
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:43,069
- Mainly, if we have the right to salvage.
- Pretty big "if".

59
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,072
- What's the split?
- We split it even, six ways.

60
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:50,784
- Even split?
- Beats me paying you overtime.

61
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:53,870
I'm good.

62
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,164
I'm in.

63
00:09:57,206 --> 00:10:00,291
Greer? What do you say?

64
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,419
All right.

65
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:09,673
Hey, Ferriman! Can you come over here?

66
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:16,554
So this is the way it works.
10% instead of your 20% finder's fee.

67
00:10:19,348 --> 00:10:22,893
I can't let you take advantage of me
like that.

68
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:27,480
That's the way it is.
Take it or leave it.

69
00:10:32,609 --> 00:10:36,362
Fine. But I go with you.

70
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,696
Not on my boat, you don't.

71
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:42,992
Think I'd tell you where a fortune
might be without insurance?

72
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,620
There are five other boats
that would jump at this.

73
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,415
I come with you.
So you take it or leave it.

74
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,942
Things are dull!

75
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:30,155
She'll love it. What do you think?

76
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:34,825
Too much off the sides, but I can
come up with something she'll love.

77
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:38,244
- Shave that yourself.
- Don't want to help me out?

78
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:45,125
Who the fuck are you kidding? Everybody
knows you Navy boys take it up the ass.

79
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:07,642
- Enjoying the ride, Jack?
- No, sir.

80
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:23,572
Not the same as flying planes
over ice sheets, is it?

81
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:27,116
- What's the appeal?
- I could ask you the same thing.

82
00:12:27,366 --> 00:12:31,912
What's a nice girl doing in a dump
like this instead of raising a family?

83
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:35,748
I own a third of Murphy's operation.
I'm not that nice.

84
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:40,001
And these monkeys are my family.

85
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,545
<i>Santos to Murphy. Come in.</i>

86
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,300
- Yeah?
- I think you should get up here.

87
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,012
<i>- What is it?
- I think you should see this!</i>

88
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,599
It was there a second ago!
Ten miles to the northwest.

89
00:12:58,849 --> 00:13:02,478
Would you turn off that fucking music?

90
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:06,272
I'm telling you, there must be a glitch.
I saw it with my own eyes.

91
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:11,777
- Glitch, my ass. There's nothing there.
- Give me a look at this.

92
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:17,823
There it is! Right in front of you!
Tell me you don't see nothing.

93
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:23,119
Do you see what I'm saying?
Do you see what I'm saying to you?

94
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:29,916
<i>- Dodge, could you get on the bow light?
- All right, Murph.</i>

95
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:37,755
- It's there, right?
- There's something there.

96
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:47,888
Hey, Murph, what's up?

97
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:51,808
<i>Vessel at position 7-5 north...</i>

98
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:55,186
...this is "Arctic Warrior".

99
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:58,147
<i>Come in.</i>

100
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:04,110
This is tugboat "Arctic Warrior".
Do you read me?

101
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:06,486
This is "Arctic Warrior".

102
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:09,947
<i>Do you read me? Come in.</i>

103
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:31,840
Shit!

104
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,280
- Now do you believe me?
- Holy shit!

105
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,618
An ocean liner?
Where did that come from?

106
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:16,626
It's the "Antonia Graza".

107
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,669
Jesus Christ.

108
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,298
<i>This is civilian tugboat "Arctic Warrior".
Is there anyone aboard?</i>

109
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,510
<i>This is civilian tugboat "Arctic Warrior".
Is there anyone aboard?</i>

110
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,014
This is "Arctic Warrior".
Can you read us?

111
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:40,770
- You know her, Murphy?
- Only in my dreams.

112
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:49,777
Christ, she's beautiful.

113
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:57,032
Italian liners couldn't compete for speed,
so they built floating art palaces instead.

114
00:15:57,282 --> 00:16:02,161
She was reported missing May 21,
1962, off the coast of Labrador.

115
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:07,791
Funny thing is, there was no distress
signal. She just disappeared.

116
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:14,714
Ever since, every captain's been looking
for her, hoping she hasn't gone down.

117
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:17,882
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

118
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:23,262
Under the law of the sea, she's ours.
Let's not keep a lady waiting.

119
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:28,558
Santos, bring us alongside. Fire up
the crane. We got business to do.

120
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:34,353
When we get onboard, stay together. We
don't know what kind of shape she's in.

121
00:16:34,603 --> 00:16:38,315
<i>- Take us up, Greer.
- Aye, aye, captain.</i>

122
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:44,945
Hey, Murphy, please remember to keep
all channels open. Thank you.

123
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:49,490
They won't let me go.

124
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:53,869
Safety first.
That's why you go last, Jack.

125
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:56,913
Can you sit down?
I'm trying to keep this steady.

126
00:16:57,164 --> 00:17:00,249
- I just want...
- Sit down! Get out of the way!

127
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:03,293
Okay.

128
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,006
She's had some battering over
the last 40 years, you can tell.

129
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:13,134
<i>Stand by. Setting you down topside.</i>

130
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,763
She's still a beaut.

131
00:17:17,013 --> 00:17:20,265
Unbelievable.

132
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:23,225
You better stay alert. Watch your step.

133
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,771
40 years of rust can turn
deck plates into quicksand.

134
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,857
We'll make our way in at the fore,
then check the bridge. This way. Careful.

135
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:37,820
<i>- Forward mast is history.
- Epps and Murphy, are they a couple?</i>

136
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:42,699
Hell, no. She's like a daughter to him.
He'd be lost without her.

137
00:17:42,949 --> 00:17:46,786
Superstructure's in decent shape.
No sign of damage.

138
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:53,875
<i>- Lifeboats are gone, stern to bow.
- Life preserver lockers are all empty.</i>

139
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,710
Sure no survivors ever
turned up, Murph?

140
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,756
Sure as we're walking on
the "Graza", Dodge. This way.

141
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,976
Let's go.

142
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:28,820
Jesus. She's no fiddler's green.

143
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,114
<i>You're wrong, Munder. She's beautiful.</i>

144
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:37,159
Whoever was on here originally
sure left in a hurry.

145
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:41,496
Murphy, come in.

146
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:58,634
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard. I'm Julie.

147
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:03,388
I'll be your hostess this evening.

148
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:09,393
Have some respect, okay?

149
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:19,151
Check out all those champagne bottles.

150
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:22,112
Looks like we missed
one hell of a party.

151
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:26,532
- And one hell of a hangover.
- Shut up!

152
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:55,930
- Shut up!
- Let's find the bridge.

153
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,516
- Such a manly man.
- What?

154
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,768
- You all right?
- Shut up!

155
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:06,146
Come on, Mary, let's go.

156
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:13,027
Murph, how many passengers
did she carry?

157
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:17,864
Over 600. The créme de la créme
of society from all over Europe.

158
00:20:18,114 --> 00:20:19,866
Crew of 500 from Italy.

159
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:24,286
Talk to me. How's everything going?

160
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:33,794
Okay, good. This companionway
should get us to the bridge.

161
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:38,047
Here, Epps, hold this.

162
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,604
What's going on?

163
00:20:57,854 --> 00:21:00,606
- After you.
- No, after you.

164
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:04,150
No, no. After me.

165
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:07,529
Tough guy.

166
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:23,541
Don't let go!

167
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:28,044
- Pull! Pull!
- Please, Epps!

168
00:21:29,963 --> 00:21:32,007
Please, Epps, don't let go!

169
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:36,385
- Give me your hand.
- Pull us up!

170
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:42,681
Oh, God!

171
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:50,146
I told you to watch your fucking step!

172
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:55,608
- Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus.
- From now on, you let me lead. Okay?

173
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:58,027
Let's go.

174
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:04,115
- I think I just shit my pants.
- No, you always smell that way.

175
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:53,780
Compass is dead.

176
00:22:57,783 --> 00:22:59,825
Helm's not responding, either.

177
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:06,957
Fuel tanks are empty. She must've rode
on full throttle till she was bone-dry.

178
00:23:08,707 --> 00:23:11,835
Epps!

179
00:23:15,588 --> 00:23:20,926
I'm looking for the ship's log.
Let's get this documentation back...

180
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:23,719
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

181
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,931
- You sure?
- Yeah.

182
00:23:27,181 --> 00:23:30,809
Let's get to it.

183
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,313
Hey, check this out.

184
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:43,026
- It's a watch. Congratulations, buddy.
- No. Look again, you moron.

185
00:23:43,277 --> 00:23:48,614
It's a digital watch. Do the math. They
didn't have digital watches in 1962.

186
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:53,618
So we're not the first people to board
this ship. But she's ours now.

187
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:59,832
Let's get some sleep, tow her at dawn.
Let's hope there's no more surprises.

188
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:02,709
Amen to that.

189
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:10,215
Oh, God.

190
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:18,555
Epps, can I get some tea?

191
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:24,101
Any sign of what might've happened?
How she got here?

192
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:27,186
That's the $64 million question,
isn't it?

193
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:30,314
Ever hear of a ship called
the "Marie Celeste"?

194
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:35,443
Twin-masted brigantine out of
Charleston during the Civil War.

195
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:38,946
She was bound for London
with a cargo of cotton.

196
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:41,448
Thanks.

197
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:46,118
Two months after she set sail, she was
sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.

198
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:50,079
She was doing 12 knots an hour
in a stiff breeze.

199
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:56,793
Something wasn't quite right. They
didn't know what so they went onboard.

200
00:24:57,044 --> 00:25:00,755
You know what they found?

201
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,965
Nothing.

202
00:25:04,215 --> 00:25:08,677
No passengers. No crew. No captain.

203
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:11,055
No sign of distress.

204
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:17,518
59 days after the last log entry, it had
traveled 4500 miles across the ocean...

205
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:25,441
...past the Rock of Gibraltar and into
the Mediterranean Sea at full sail.

206
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,859
And nobody at the helm.

207
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:32,405
- What do you make of that?
- A ghost ship.

208
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,576
Hey, you smell that?
I smell bullshit.

209
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:43,080
- Been on the sea a lot longer than you.
- I know.

210
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,833
Seen things that
you can't even imagine.

211
00:25:48,084 --> 00:25:52,837
<i>Maritime history is full of
Marie Celestes.</i>

212
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:55,674
So, what's our plan?

213
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:59,677
I think we should do what we came
to do. Tie her up, tug her in.

214
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:05,348
You think our little tug
will pull this entire ocean liner?

215
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:07,516
Not with the problems we got.

216
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,894
We could set her at anchor
and come back with two or three tugs.

217
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:14,730
No, some Russian trawler
will come along.

218
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:18,900
I've already looked for her anchors,
anyway. They're gone.

219
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:22,069
- What do you think?
- Get the engines working...

220
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,447
...it could take us two weeks
minimum to tow a vessel this size.

221
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:32,536
For my share of what she's worth,
I'd drag her back to Anchorage myself.

222
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,462
Don't let go!

223
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:51,009
Help me! Don't let go!

224
00:26:51,217 --> 00:26:57,014
- Thought you might want a jacket.
- Thanks.

225
00:27:07,397 --> 00:27:08,772
Boy, do I miss that.

226
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:14,527
You okay? You seem quiet
since you came back.

227
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:20,240
I think I saw something
I couldn't possibly have seen.

228
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,784
- Like what?
- No, it's crazy.

229
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:26,787
I'm curious. Tell me.

230
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,584
I think I saw a little girl.

231
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:36,045
On...

232
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:39,505
On the... The boat?

233
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:44,551
Yeah. Looking right at me.

234
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,762
And then what happened?

235
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:49,555
Nothing. She disappeared.

236
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:54,309
Sometimes, when I'd be flying
for hours on end...

237
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,853
...I'd think I'd see stuff too.

238
00:27:58,103 --> 00:28:03,942
It'd be there one second
and gone the next. Like a dream.

239
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,486
Thanks.

240
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:11,198
- See you in the a.m.
- Okay.

241
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:14,617
Good night.

242
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:20,455
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

243
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:45,808
She's got a big hole.
She's sinking.

244
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:51,271
- This is where the damage is. See?
- Breach in the hull, about 10 by 20...

245
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:56,441
...torn to the port collision bulkhead.
- Did it hit an iceberg?

246
00:28:56,692 --> 00:29:00,444
No, you don't need an iceberg
to rupture a hull.

247
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:04,114
- She's been hit recently.
- About a week ago, I'd say.

248
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:05,866
This is where we are.

249
00:29:06,116 --> 00:29:09,660
The problem's this group of islands.
Nothing spectacular...

250
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,204
...just rocks,
a couple thousand seals.

251
00:29:12,454 --> 00:29:16,249
The "Antonia Graza"'s caught here
in this strong current loop...

252
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:20,878
...and slowly she's been pushed towards
those rocks. Last time she hit them.

253
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:23,629
- What about next time?
- Won't be one.

254
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,758
We've got three days to fix it.
That's if the weather holds.

255
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:29,885
Why can't we tow it like it is?

256
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:33,220
It'd be like towing a car
with four flat tires.

257
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:40,351
- It's a bump in the road. We can fix it.
- Murph, bump in the road?

258
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:44,479
The breach we can probably patch
if we can get to the inside.

259
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:50,151
We'll weld shut the flooded compartments,
pump out the water up to the aft peak.

260
00:29:50,401 --> 00:29:53,236
On top of that, the rudder's jammed.

261
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:58,073
We jerry-rig it, set a 38-degree
current drift to clear the island chain.

262
00:29:58,324 --> 00:30:01,160
What does all that mean?

263
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,537
I just... That's a lot
of work for three days.

264
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:09,082
But with the gear we've got onboard
and what's on that ship, we can try.

265
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,584
We can do it, right?

266
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:15,546
With the gear we've got onboard,
I can't fix our engine.

267
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:18,840
Quit bitching and overhaul
the starboard engine.

268
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,093
- So that's the plan?
- Just do it.

269
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:29,891
- I'll call it in.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

270
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:32,518
- Maritime law states...
- I know.

271
00:30:32,768 --> 00:30:38,981
We just don't want any
unexpected guests. Just leave it.

272
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:41,858
Your call, captain.

273
00:30:45,152 --> 00:30:48,572
All right, you know the drill.
We do a complete recon.

274
00:30:48,822 --> 00:30:52,242
Make sure we've got no problems
before we get to work.

275
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:55,118
- Stay with me, Greer. Don't wander.
- Okay.

276
00:30:55,369 --> 00:30:57,871
Dodge, Munder, go to the port
collision bulkhead.

277
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:01,707
Jack and I'll work back from the fore.
Call if you need anything.

278
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:05,293
- How about a pizza?
- You're so funny.

279
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:10,297
The only plan in this business is that
there is no plan. What is that?

280
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:17,595
What these people talking crazy for?
That's not even good English.

281
00:31:17,762 --> 00:31:19,471
Hang in there, okay, "preciosa"?

282
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:24,976
Because someday he'll find
some other genius to fix his boat.

283
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:30,605
You want to play like that?

284
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:33,774
It's still sweet, though.

285
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:37,736
Light coming up.

286
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,785
You were right. She is beautiful.

287
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:49,662
She sure is.

288
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:35,032
Epps, we're heading for
the main engine room. Epps?

289
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:01,928
All right, "capitano".

290
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,695
Oh, shit.

291
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:13,032
We're gonna have to dive
to get to that tear.

292
00:35:13,282 --> 00:35:18,244
Epps, the engine room
is totally flooded.

293
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:22,247
Epps, can you hear me?

294
00:35:27,627 --> 00:35:30,337
Wait!

295
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,964
What happened? You okay?

296
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:39,511
What are you doing down there?
Did you hurt yourself?

297
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,042
What are you doing?

298
00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:24,380
The whole bottom's riddled with them.

299
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,090
Looks like someone
used it for target practice.

300
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,802
- That's the happy version.
- What's the not-so-happy version?

301
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:33,637
There were people in there.

302
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,848
I saw that little girl again.

303
00:36:36,097 --> 00:36:40,017
What? Where?

304
00:36:40,268 --> 00:36:44,354
- I must be losing my goddamn mind.
- Well, did she say anything?

305
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:48,816
Forget it. Come on.

306
00:37:14,003 --> 00:37:16,421
Murphy, come in.

307
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:20,340
Dodge! Anybody!

308
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:23,135
Shit.

309
00:37:25,636 --> 00:37:29,514
I think she's fucking with us.

310
00:38:11,924 --> 00:38:16,219
Looks like central laundry.

311
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,475
This vent connects to the forward hold.
We need to see if it's flooded.

312
00:38:24,725 --> 00:38:29,687
- I may need help shutting it.
- You sure we need to...?

313
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:48,577
Murphy, where the hell are you?

314
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:52,163
- How long have they been here?
- A month, maybe less.

315
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,499
- What are we gonna do?
- Get off this boat!

316
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:58,085
- But the ship...
- If it sinks, it sinks.

317
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:00,336
You're right.

318
00:39:00,586 --> 00:39:04,215
Stinks.

319
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:06,842
- What the hell?
- We came through there.

320
00:39:07,092 --> 00:39:10,386
No shit!

321
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:16,099
Come on!

322
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:22,062
This way. Come on, Jack.

323
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:40,243
What the...?

324
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:49,500
When'd you start
wearing lipstick, Epps?

325
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:53,045
Epps?

326
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:57,716
"Francesca."

327
00:39:57,965 --> 00:40:00,217
Nice titties.

328
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:07,265
Not that you can hold a candle
to the future Mrs. Greer, though.

329
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:25,279
Come on, Jack. Stop dragging ass!
What's your problem?

330
00:40:29,115 --> 00:40:30,867
What's this?

331
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:35,871
Forget it. Let's go! Jack!

332
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:39,665
'58 Jaguar X150. I've dreamt
about this car since I was a kid.

333
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:45,796
We have to get out of here now.
Do you understand? Now.

334
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:56,011
There's something moving in there.

335
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:12,608
Fuck!

336
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:16,986
Oh, my God!
I hate rats!

337
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:20,239
What?

338
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:23,617
Oh, my God! Look at this!

339
00:41:23,867 --> 00:41:25,535
I have to get Murphy.

340
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:28,830
Murphy!

341
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,085
Is someone trying to call me?

342
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:39,003
Dodge! Munder!

343
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:41,756
<i>Maureen...</i>

344
00:41:42,006 --> 00:41:44,091
Who's Maureen?

345
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:48,178
It's my first name.

346
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,764
<i>- It's cold...
- He said "cold"?</i>

347
00:41:52,014 --> 00:41:55,517
The galley.

348
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:08,027
<i>- It's cold.
- Please help us.</i>

349
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:15,408
Don't go in there.

350
00:42:52,312 --> 00:42:56,398
You fucking assholes!
Fuck you!

351
00:42:56,648 --> 00:42:58,484
Take it easy!

352
00:42:58,734 --> 00:43:02,945
You were fucking with us. We fucked
with you. Why aren't you laughing?

353
00:43:03,196 --> 00:43:07,741
Wanna hear something funnier? We
found dead guys in the laundry room.

354
00:43:07,991 --> 00:43:13,162
And this in the cargo hold.

355
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,507
Need some help, skipper?

356
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:33,387
I'm sorry.

357
00:43:49,691 --> 00:43:51,359
- Jesus.
- Oh, man.

358
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:55,237
Holy shit!

359
00:43:58,198 --> 00:44:00,616
Yeah!

360
00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:03,618
We're rich!

361
00:44:03,868 --> 00:44:08,414
- You son of a bitch!
- Rich!

362
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:14,210
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move this shit out!

363
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,213
One. Two. Three...

364
00:44:34,268 --> 00:44:36,769
How much you figure it's worth, boss?

365
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,149
There's a lot of gold. Hard to know.
Two, 300 million, maybe. Maybe more.

366
00:44:42,399 --> 00:44:44,109
- Jesus.
- I don't know.

367
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:47,695
Lock boxes with half of Fort Knox
in them? They gotta be insured.

368
00:44:47,945 --> 00:44:51,364
No way somebody will let
this much gold float away.

369
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:54,993
Well, the markings have been
filed down.

370
00:44:55,243 --> 00:45:00,247
- What does that mean?
- Someone didn't want this traceable.

371
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,539
It's stolen.

372
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:06,418
It may have to do with the reason
this ship disappeared when it did.

373
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:10,047
Wait. If the gold's got
something to do with 1962...

374
00:45:10,297 --> 00:45:14,675
...what about the bodies? They can't be
more than three weeks old.

375
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:19,679
Somebody's gotta say it, and it might as
well be me. This ship is fucked up.

376
00:45:19,929 --> 00:45:25,099
Earlier I could swear I heard
a woman singing. It's like she was...

377
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:29,520
- Like she was coming on to me.
- Oh, no!

378
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:35,399
It was the sexiest voice
I ever heard, man.

379
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:41,821
- She got any backup singers?
- Whatever you're on, get me some!

380
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:46,033
Maybe you're not quite
ready to get married, Greer.

381
00:45:46,283 --> 00:45:47,910
- Fuck you.
- Okay, guys.

382
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,828
- What about the Coast Guard?
- No.

383
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:57,209
You call the Coast Guard... What if
the gold did turn out to be stolen?

384
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:02,213
Under maritime law, anything
found in international waters...

385
00:46:02,463 --> 00:46:06,091
...belongs to the finder. Okay?
That is the law.

386
00:46:06,341 --> 00:46:08,926
- Right.
- Finders keepers.

387
00:46:09,176 --> 00:46:11,970
If we're gonna do this,
I say we do it now.

388
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:16,432
Get our boat going, grab the gold
and get the hell out of here.

389
00:46:16,683 --> 00:46:20,018
We leave the boat, take the gold.
Who's with me?

390
00:46:20,268 --> 00:46:23,771
I'm with the gold, man.

391
00:46:24,021 --> 00:46:25,815
Gold.

392
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:29,401
The gold.

393
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:34,697
- Epps?
- I just want to get off this boat.

394
00:46:34,947 --> 00:46:38,366
Okay. Let's go to work.

395
00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:45,122
<i>Okay. "Warrior" is in position, Murph.
Can we please get the hell out of here?</i>

396
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:50,042
Yeah, "preciosa"! Smell that money!
100 million. You hear what I'm saying?

397
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:53,586
100 million!

398
00:46:54,129 --> 00:46:56,213
Greer? Get those engines going.

399
00:46:56,463 --> 00:46:58,257
<i>I'm bringing the gold down.</i>

400
00:46:58,507 --> 00:47:00,801
Yes, sir, captain, sir.

401
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:06,305
<i>Hey, Santos. Hurry your ass up, "vato".
We almost got the gold.</i>

402
00:47:06,555 --> 00:47:12,059
I wanna see these gauges rocking,
because you just had an overhaul.

403
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:16,563
And you, I want you
to give me some too.

404
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:22,359
Let's do this!

405
00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:24,862
<i>Hey, yo, Greer! Fire it up!</i>

406
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:29,990
We're going to haul ass.
Bring it on! We'll be so fucking rich!

407
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,200
Stop!

408
00:47:32,451 --> 00:47:35,661
Stop! You don't know
what you're doing!

409
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:39,123
We're good to go, skipper.

410
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:45,127
Don't start the boats! He'll...

411
00:47:45,169 --> 00:47:46,920
Shit!

412
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:50,256
Greer!

413
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:55,177
Greer! What the hell just happened?

414
00:47:55,427 --> 00:47:59,847
Jesus Christ! Fire on deck!

415
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:13,566
Santos! Greer! Munder!

416
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:30,246
I got you.

417
00:48:30,497 --> 00:48:36,126
- Epps! I got Munder!
- Greer!

418
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:38,670
Come on!

419
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:44,549
Santos!
Santos, answer me!

420
00:49:03,856 --> 00:49:09,611
I don't know what happened.
The engine room just blew.

421
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:13,823
Maybe Santos rushed the engines,
didn't seal up the gaskets right...

422
00:49:14,073 --> 00:49:18,952
Jack, did you find anything out about
this ship before you sent us out here?

423
00:49:19,202 --> 00:49:23,122
No, but I... Look, we've got
the gold, and we are still alive.

424
00:49:23,372 --> 00:49:25,999
- Tell that to Santos, asshole!
- Ease up!

425
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:28,001
This is bullshit!

426
00:49:28,251 --> 00:49:30,377
Santos came here out of free will...

427
00:49:30,627 --> 00:49:33,422
...just like us.
- What does that mean?

428
00:49:33,672 --> 00:49:35,798
- Enough!
- Santos is dead because of you!

429
00:49:36,048 --> 00:49:40,302
Come on! It's not gonna
bring him back.

430
00:49:58,525 --> 00:50:03,237
Murph, it's not your fault.
You know that.

431
00:50:13,828 --> 00:50:17,290
How is he?

432
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:22,586
Here's the plan. We're professional
salvors with a fortune onboard.

433
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:26,005
I say we do what we do best:
Fix this rust bucket.

434
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:28,757
Control her drift. Clear those islands.

435
00:50:29,007 --> 00:50:31,509
We can survive long enough
to get picked up.

436
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,720
Why is this a question?
We have the materials.

437
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:40,516
Why don't we build a raft and leave?
There is something wrong with this boat!

438
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,186
- If we stay here, we may not survive.
- You want to build a raft?

439
00:50:44,436 --> 00:50:47,021
- I want to build a raft.
- Even with the "Warrior"...

440
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:51,442
...we were stretching to do this
in three days. We can't do this.

441
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:54,110
You're the best spot-welder I know.

442
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:57,821
We can do it right now,
but I need you.

443
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:04,744
Fine. But there's no way we're doing
a major patch-and-pump in the dark.

444
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:07,371
Even with the lights we have,
it'd be like going in blind.

445
00:51:07,621 --> 00:51:12,708
Okay, fine. We'll chill tonight
and go in the a.m.

446
00:51:14,502 --> 00:51:16,753
Greer? What do you say?

447
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:20,839
Now you want to know what
the first mate has to say?

448
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:25,302
I say go to hell, Epps. You're not
qualified to get us off this ship.

449
00:51:25,551 --> 00:51:28,763
Had Murphy let me do it my way,
we wouldn't be in this.

450
00:51:29,013 --> 00:51:32,933
- And the Coast Guard...
- So it's everybody else's fault, right?

451
00:51:33,183 --> 00:51:36,394
They'd be here and we'd
be on our way home, millionaires.

452
00:51:36,644 --> 00:51:38,771
That's bullshit.

453
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:42,023
Grow up, asshole.

454
00:51:42,023 --> 00:51:46,318
Fucking bitch! Keep fucking talking.
Say another word!

455
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:50,363
Say another word!

456
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,946
Here it is. Katie. B-deck.

457
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:45,157
You were alone.

458
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,370
<i>100-to-1, somebody poisoned
the passengers to get the gold.</i>

459
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:55,373
<i>Okay, Sherlock, if they were poisoned,
why are these cans safe?</i>

460
00:52:55,624 --> 00:52:59,543
They're still sealed.
It's been sealed for 40 years. It's safe.

461
00:52:59,793 --> 00:53:04,547
Okay, shoot for it. Loser goes first.

462
00:53:05,006 --> 00:53:08,008
- Paper beats rock.
- Come on, man, best of three.

463
00:53:08,258 --> 00:53:11,260
- Bullshit. You lost.
- Where's your empathy?

464
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:17,474
Winners do not empathize
with losers. Bon appétit.

465
00:53:25,647 --> 00:53:27,732
I screwed up.

466
00:53:27,982 --> 00:53:29,901
I should've called it in.

467
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:34,321
Damn! I knew better!

468
00:53:34,571 --> 00:53:39,158
I'll make it home to you, baby.
I swear.

469
00:53:40,242 --> 00:53:43,828
What the hell are you looking at?

470
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,711
- That's all right.
- No way.

471
00:53:53,962 --> 00:53:57,172
No, really. It's good.
Look, I'm not kidding.

472
00:53:57,422 --> 00:54:02,051
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. It's good!

473
00:54:03,886 --> 00:54:06,263
- You gotta try that!
- That's good!

474
00:54:06,513 --> 00:54:08,682
That's great!

475
00:54:08,931 --> 00:54:12,101
Katie?

476
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:21,275
Katie?

477
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:42,208
Can I tell you something else?
We get back...

478
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:48,045
...I'm gonna take my money
and I'm gonna buy you a bathtub.

479
00:54:48,296 --> 00:54:52,507
I'll get you a lifetime supply
of titty magazines and toilet paper!

480
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:56,803
I already beat you to it, bro!

481
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:03,766
There's something on your...

482
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,742
Katie?

483
00:58:27,929 --> 00:58:31,306
Who, me?

484
00:58:35,267 --> 00:58:39,145
Francesca, I know
all of this isn't real.

485
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:44,024
So I'm just gonna go with it, okay?

486
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:50,488
Can't cheat on your fiancée
with a dead girl, right?

487
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:20,762
Her parents.

488
00:59:22,012 --> 00:59:25,432
Please.

489
00:59:25,891 --> 00:59:29,811
Don't close it.

490
00:59:31,562 --> 00:59:35,399
Haven't seen them for years.

491
00:59:35,649 --> 00:59:38,317
They moved to New York.

492
00:59:38,568 --> 00:59:42,863
I was on my way to join them.

493
00:59:43,155 --> 00:59:46,115
But they're dead now.

494
00:59:46,866 --> 00:59:49,493
- How would you know?
- When you're like this...

495
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:53,121
...you know these things.

496
00:59:53,454 --> 00:59:56,623
My mother...

497
00:59:56,707 --> 00:59:59,834
...she made me this dress.

498
01:00:00,084 --> 01:00:02,795
Do you like it?

499
01:00:06,548 --> 01:00:10,259
You remind me of her.

500
01:00:10,301 --> 01:00:14,096
I don't think so.

501
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:20,225
Well, here. You should have this back.

502
01:00:25,396 --> 01:00:30,275
Oh, God, you really are
a fucking ghost.

503
01:00:33,569 --> 01:00:37,239
Where are you going?

504
01:00:48,998 --> 01:00:54,836
Santos was my goddamn responsibility.

505
01:01:06,304 --> 01:01:10,516
- The "Lorelei".
- She was adrift. We rescued her.

506
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:15,478
I've heard the story of the "Lorelei".

507
01:01:15,603 --> 01:01:20,106
I didn't know the "Graza" was involved.

508
01:01:21,107 --> 01:01:25,152
The gold was onboard the "Lorelei"?

509
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:30,990
It says here "May 19, 1962".

510
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:36,327
That's two days before
your ship disappeared.

511
01:01:36,953 --> 01:01:42,082
There were no survivors
onboard the "Lorelei".

512
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:51,005
Jesus Christ!

513
01:01:54,676 --> 01:01:58,303
Where you going?

514
01:02:17,068 --> 01:02:20,320
Most spirits are free
to be with their families.

515
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:25,032
So why aren't you with yours?

516
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:31,288
- We're all trapped here.
- Who?

517
01:02:31,538 --> 01:02:34,123
My shipmates and I.

518
01:02:34,373 --> 01:02:37,126
Even the ones who aren't marked.

519
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:38,626
Marked?

520
01:02:38,877 --> 01:02:40,962
Katie, what do you mean?

521
01:02:41,212 --> 01:02:44,548
When the boat's full...

522
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:47,092
What? You can tell me.

523
01:02:47,342 --> 01:02:53,764
When he has all the souls he needs
and has filled his quota...

524
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:57,058
...we'll all be ferried...

525
01:02:57,309 --> 01:02:59,810
...to...

526
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:03,271
What is it? What's wrong?

527
01:03:03,897 --> 01:03:07,150
- What is it?
- He doesn't want me talking to you.

528
01:03:07,399 --> 01:03:10,027
- He who?
- But I'm not like the others!

529
01:03:10,277 --> 01:03:11,862
You need to tell me.

530
01:03:12,111 --> 01:03:16,365
You must go at once.
Leave the ship while you still can!

531
01:03:16,616 --> 01:03:19,993
Katie, what is it?

532
01:03:20,202 --> 01:03:24,997
Katie! Katie?

533
01:03:25,247 --> 01:03:27,415
Epps?

534
01:03:27,665 --> 01:03:29,626
Come on!

535
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:32,920
We have to leave.

536
01:03:34,171 --> 01:03:37,507
Where you going, Murphy?

537
01:03:39,509 --> 01:03:42,511
What's the matter? It's me.

538
01:03:42,761 --> 01:03:44,429
Santos.

539
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:49,683
It's no fun lying
at the bottom of the ocean.

540
01:03:51,768 --> 01:03:56,522
No lights at the end of the tunnel.
Not for me, Murph.

541
01:03:56,772 --> 01:04:01,109
No 10,000 virgins at the pearly gates.

542
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:06,279
Because of the plan, I'm trapped
on this dreamboat of yours.

543
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:12,493
So you know what?
You're coming along for the ride.

544
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:36,512
No!

545
01:04:43,351 --> 01:04:45,978
Murphy?

546
01:04:55,819 --> 01:04:59,572
You all right, Murph?

547
01:05:00,322 --> 01:05:03,199
You okay?

548
01:05:05,827 --> 01:05:09,580
- What's the matter, Murph?
- It's me!

549
01:05:15,168 --> 01:05:20,714
- It's me!
- Do it, come on. It'll make you feel good.

550
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:29,220
Come on!

551
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:38,519
- Come on!
- Hey!

552
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:49,236
Oh, God.
Epps, you okay?

553
01:05:52,238 --> 01:05:55,783
- Keep him in the aquarium.
- No, listen. He was drunk.

554
01:05:56,033 --> 01:05:58,827
He didn't know what he was doing.

555
01:05:59,078 --> 01:06:03,664
Look, he just tried to kill you.
He stays in there.

556
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:07,959
Let's go find Greer.

557
01:06:17,592 --> 01:06:19,802
Any sign of him?

558
01:06:20,052 --> 01:06:21,470
No, we looked all over.

559
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,264
Man's pissed off.
Seems to happen on this boat.

560
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:28,851
- Least we weren't around 40 years ago.
- The passengers were poisoned...

561
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:33,271
...to get to the gold? Isn't that...?
- Extreme? Maybe, but if the shoe fits...

562
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:36,524
Next thing you know,
we'll be trying to kill each other.

563
01:06:36,774 --> 01:06:40,693
- What's with the heart?
- Found it. Belonged to this little girl.

564
01:06:40,944 --> 01:06:44,446
- What girl?
- She told me to get off this boat.

565
01:06:44,696 --> 01:06:48,158
- She's talking to you now?
- What are you talking about?

566
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:51,702
- You're seeing ghosts, Epps?
- Just forget it.

567
01:06:51,953 --> 01:06:53,912
So the ship's got a few kinks.

568
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:58,165
Let's stick with Munder's specs
and try to fix the ship.

569
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:01,669
No way five people and the gold
will fit on any raft.

570
01:07:01,919 --> 01:07:05,380
Murphy's not going anywhere,
and we're not leaving him here.

571
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:11,218
We stick with the plan. Fix the boat.
Let's get going. Come on.

572
01:07:20,183 --> 01:07:22,852
<i>That's the collision bulkhead hatch.</i>

573
01:07:23,102 --> 01:07:26,605
<i>- Wheel's busted. It won't open.
- Arming the C4.</i>

574
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:27,856
<i>- Dodge?
- I'm good.</i>

575
01:07:28,106 --> 01:07:29,441
<i>- Munder?
- I'm good.</i>

576
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:33,152
<i>Contact.</i>

577
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:39,407
<i>- There's the tear, portside.
- Looks bigger from here.</i>

578
01:07:39,657 --> 01:07:43,827
<i>- I'll shut her up.
- No problem.</i>

579
01:07:44,911 --> 01:07:50,833
<i>- Munder, rudder's fixed. You all right?
- I'm good.</i>

580
01:07:51,082 --> 01:07:55,878
<i>- What do you think, Dodge?
- She'll hold.</i>

581
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:01,674
<i>- We're set with the pumps.
- Start them up.</i>

582
01:08:01,924 --> 01:08:04,886
Copy that, Epps.
One and two, kicking in.

583
01:08:05,136 --> 01:08:08,680
- I give it 12 hours till she's bone-dry.
- Both on full.

584
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:11,974
<i>Get ready, Epps. Here it comes.</i>

585
01:08:12,224 --> 01:08:15,101
<i>Great work, guys.</i>

586
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:36,619
Damn. Current's faster than I thought.

587
01:08:37,036 --> 01:08:43,291
If we control her drift, headed in this
direction, we should clear those islands.

588
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:46,377
We'll keep it afloat
until we get picked up.

589
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:49,796
Son of a bitch.
We may just get out of this yet.

590
01:08:50,046 --> 01:08:51,172
Kazillionaires.

591
01:08:51,422 --> 01:08:54,132
Check on the bridge
when you're done here.

592
01:08:54,383 --> 01:08:58,469
I'll see if I can find Greer
down below.

593
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:05,141
Greer?

594
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:23,322
Katie?

595
01:09:34,331 --> 01:09:38,167
Greer? Jesus!

596
01:09:44,297 --> 01:09:46,882
- Shit.
- Number two's clogged. Who's going?

597
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:50,720
You go.

598
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:54,556
Shit. Every single time!

599
01:09:56,181 --> 01:09:58,642
Oh, my God.

600
01:09:58,892 --> 01:10:02,311
Come with me.

601
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,064
I want to show you something.

602
01:14:27,438 --> 01:14:28,982
No!

603
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:31,650
Come on! No!

604
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,027
Come on!

605
01:14:35,278 --> 01:14:40,115
You can't die on me!

606
01:15:32,823 --> 01:15:35,534
Dodge. Murphy's dead.

607
01:15:35,784 --> 01:15:38,119
- What?
- We have to get off this boat.

608
01:15:38,369 --> 01:15:42,456
There's a reason you, me and Munder are
still alive. That's why he came after us.

609
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:48,210
- To fix his ship.
- I just saw Murphy. What's happening?

610
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,964
I don't know.

611
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,967
I want you and Dodge
on the rudder.

612
01:15:56,217 --> 01:15:58,719
- But you just said...
- Listen to me.

613
01:15:58,969 --> 01:16:04,933
I'll get Munder, we'll see if the welds
are holding. Stay here till we get back.

614
01:16:05,183 --> 01:16:09,102
I do not want you out of
each other's sight. Take this.

615
01:16:09,353 --> 01:16:12,855
Take it.

616
01:16:13,314 --> 01:16:17,776
- Be careful down there.
- I will.

617
01:17:10,985 --> 01:17:14,570
- That's it, then. We made it.
- For now.

618
01:17:14,821 --> 01:17:17,824
- I'll check on Epps.
- No, she said to wait here.

619
01:17:18,074 --> 01:17:23,077
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, she said to wait! So wait.

620
01:17:35,337 --> 01:17:36,964
You disgust me.

621
01:17:37,214 --> 01:17:39,924
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

622
01:17:40,174 --> 01:17:44,177
You're a pathetic excuse for a man.
She says, "Jump", and you jump.

623
01:17:44,428 --> 01:17:49,140
You're disgusting.
I don't have time for this.

624
01:17:53,518 --> 01:17:58,147
- Who the hell are you?
- The question is, who are you?

625
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:01,691
You worship her, yet you've
never had the balls to tell her...

626
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:04,944
...because you're a weak,
cowardly child.

627
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:12,325
However, if you'll kindly step out of
my way, I'll make your dream a reality.

628
01:18:12,575 --> 01:18:17,621
You know, Dodge, if you kill somebody,
you go to hell.

629
01:18:18,455 --> 01:18:23,542
Well, you live for her.
You willing to die for her?

630
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:09,495
I shot Ferriman. He's dead.

631
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,456
Yeah? Don't be so sure, Dodge.

632
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:16,459
- What are you doing?
- Trip's over. I'm sinking the boat.

633
01:19:16,709 --> 01:19:19,253
- It's taken its last victim.
- That'll kill us.

634
01:19:19,503 --> 01:19:22,130
- We'll have to take our chances.
- What about the gold?

635
01:19:22,381 --> 01:19:26,676
Fucking kidding? We're not getting the
gold off this boat. Nobody ever does.

636
01:19:26,926 --> 01:19:29,135
Wait, wait. Wait!

637
01:19:29,386 --> 01:19:33,055
That gold can give us everything
we ever wanted.

638
01:19:33,305 --> 01:19:36,809
We could have our own boat.
The two of us.

639
01:19:37,059 --> 01:19:40,228
We could have a life together.
You and me.

640
01:19:40,478 --> 01:19:45,148
What are you talking about?
Dodge, we gotta get out of here. Now.

641
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:49,485
Well, I can't let you do that.

642
01:19:55,574 --> 01:19:59,034
So that's it, huh?

643
01:19:59,368 --> 01:20:01,953
All right. Okay.

644
01:20:02,203 --> 01:20:06,124
You win. All right.

645
01:20:07,457 --> 01:20:09,543
Fucking bitch!

646
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:12,336
All right, you win! Go ahead, do it!

647
01:20:12,587 --> 01:20:14,839
Go ahead. Blow it up!

648
01:20:15,089 --> 01:20:18,008
Kill us all!

649
01:20:19,092 --> 01:20:25,306
Hey, Dodge. Why haven't you
asked me where Munder is?

650
01:20:30,934 --> 01:20:35,022
Well, I suppose that's because...

651
01:20:35,272 --> 01:20:37,231
...I already know.

652
01:20:37,481 --> 01:20:41,067
- You won't pull that trigger, Maureen.
- Try me.

653
01:20:41,318 --> 01:20:46,113
Dodge made the same mistake.
He's dead.

654
01:20:46,614 --> 01:20:48,365
Katie told you, didn't she?

655
01:20:48,616 --> 01:20:52,744
Souls without sin can't be marked.
Makes them tough to control.

656
01:20:52,994 --> 01:20:56,330
But as long as I keep the boat afloat,
we'll all go down together.

657
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:59,957
- What the fuck are you?
- I'm a salvager.

658
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:05,045
Just like you.
You collect ships, I collect souls.

659
01:21:05,295 --> 01:21:08,798
And when I fill my quota,
I send a boatload home.

660
01:21:09,048 --> 01:21:12,760
This will make management happy.
You see, it's a job.

661
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:15,553
Given to me after a lifetime of sin.

662
01:21:15,803 --> 01:21:21,725
So if I lose this ship, management won't
be happy, which is not a good thing.

663
01:21:21,975 --> 01:21:26,103
I'm not getting through to you.
I'm asking for an exchange.

664
01:21:26,354 --> 01:21:28,563
This ship for your life.

665
01:21:28,813 --> 01:21:30,982
I want my crew back.

666
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:35,402
Sorry. Once a passenger's marked,
they're mine.

667
01:21:35,653 --> 01:21:39,572
Then I guess it's over.

668
01:21:47,745 --> 01:21:51,499
All you had to do was fix the ship!

669
01:21:54,167 --> 01:21:57,003
I gave you a great opportunity.

670
01:21:57,253 --> 01:22:01,006
All you had to do was take it.

671
01:22:04,342 --> 01:22:08,679
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

672
01:25:31,006 --> 01:25:35,384
Careful. Hang in there, ma'am.

673
01:26:00,612 --> 01:26:03,472
No!
