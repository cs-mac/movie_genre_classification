1
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:04,922
You'll be spending
a lot of time in here.

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:06,840
This is gonna be your room.

3
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:10,427
There's some kind of animal being
de-liced or something.

4
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:13,097
Compression chamber.
That's your crib.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,891
It's hermetically sealed.

6
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:18,936
And this is your paint color.

7
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:22,439
- What color is that, hon?
- Jamaica Bay Blue.

8
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:25,693
Jamaica! And there you are.

9
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,778
- Hi.
- Yes, hi.

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,946
And there's your dad,

11
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:31,365
who's playing with his new toy
instead of helping me paint.

12
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,867
Sorry. I can help.

13
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,036
- Yeah? Come on.
- If I wasn't...

14
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:37,121
If I wasn't filming I would help.

15
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,206
Go and get the other ladder.

16
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,625
Yeah, you should have
a real ladder. That's... You know.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,043
All right, that's a...

18
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:44,712
- Who's that?
- It's my sister.

19
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:45,963
She's here to check out the nursery.

20
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:49,717
- Daniel, this is gorgeous.
- Yeah?

21
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,136
This is so gorgeous.
I love it. I love the blue.

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,138
I'm glad y'all went with that.
It's much better than the green.

23
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:55,973
- How are you feeling?
- All right.

24
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,391
You know, I think I'm okay.

25
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,143
- How is he?
- He's doing so good.

26
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:00,811
He's kicking and, like, swimming.

27
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,062
- I feel like he's swimming.
- Hey, little fella!

28
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,230
- What did you say?
- It's Hunter.

29
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,565
- No! Tyler. It's Tyler.
- I like that.

30
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,150
- It's Tyler Hunter.
- It's...

31
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:08,068
I like... I like both.
I don't wanna choose.

32
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,070
- I'm not gonna get into this.
- You have to. Come on.

33
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,740
In preparation for the big move,
I have a couple of boxes in my car

34
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:16,076
that I would
love to throw in your basement.

35
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:18,078
Please?

36
00:01:18,163 --> 00:01:19,747
- This is the last box.
- Really?

37
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,957
Probably.

38
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:24,168
Oh, God!

39
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:29,006
So, a little bit nervous?

40
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,841
No, I'm excited.

41
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,342
I spend all my time
over at Micah's anyway.

42
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,929
VHS? That is old school.

43
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:38,265
Do we have a VCR?

44
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,601
I didn't even know
you had this much stuff.

45
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:43,520
Somehow I ended up with it
after Grandma Lois died.

46
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,773
I haven't even gone through it.

47
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:48,442
- How come you got it?
- I don't know. You can have it.

48
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:49,777
Nobody ever gives me anything.

49
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,612
So who's gonna get the top bunk?

50
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:53,781
We're not 12.

51
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:56,200
We can get a VCR for free.

52
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,286
You know, I don't remember these at all.

53
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,829
You guys didn't go Beta, huh?

54
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,212
That's fine, okay?
I'm just gonna tape over an old one.

55
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,379
Can you get Abby out of here, please?

56
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:10,547
She's gonna get cut on the glass!

57
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,133
We just got back and the whole
place is pretty much destroyed.

58
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:14,718
Nothing seems to be actually missing.

59
00:02:14,803 --> 00:02:15,969
It's just, everything's really...

60
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,387
That's what she's telling me.

61
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:18,722
Just make sure
we document everything.

62
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:19,848
Don't touch anything.

63
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,648
This is our basement.

64
00:02:27,732 --> 00:02:29,066
I don't see anything really broken.

65
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,736
I don't see that box of tapes
that Katie brought over.

66
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:35,405
Looks like that's the
only thing that's missing.

67
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,333
All right and there she is.

68
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,836
The mother of the birthday girl,
my girlfriend...

69
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,254
Chocolate, chocolate, rainbow stuff.

70
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,339
- That is a good-looking cake.
- Which is exactly what she wanted.

71
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:56,552
Beautiful. Just beautiful. And you're
beautiful. I don't know how you do it.

72
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,222
Are you okay?

73
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,602
Watch your backs!

74
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,693
Watch your hair. Good job.

75
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,697
All right, and here's the birthday girl.

76
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,781
I found some.

77
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:21,952
She looks pretty unhappy.
Something's going on.

78
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,787
We got the young one.
Under the trampoline.

79
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:25,956
- Twenty bites and that's about all.
- Twenty bites?

80
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,541
That's what my mother
used to make me do.

81
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,126
That's a lot of cake on that plate.

82
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,961
Hey, Julie. Go get Kristi.

83
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:35,966
Say hi, Kristi!

84
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,092
Hi.

85
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,220
Kristi's a little shy.

86
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,889
That's cute. They love each other.

87
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:45,601
It's Grandma.
Happy, happy, happy birthday.

88
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:49,479
Never forget the day you were born.
I held you in my arms

89
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:52,399
and you made me laugh and cry
at the same time. You were so cute.

90
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,318
Serious piece of equipment,
so be careful.

91
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,403
How do you shoot
those weddings with this thing?

92
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,656
- It must hurt your back.
- It's something...

93
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,408
You have to work certain parts of your...

94
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,827
I've only been here for a few months...

95
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,455
But thank you
for welcoming me into your family.

96
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,582
I...

97
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,084
- I just... I love you, and I love...
- Dennis, my shoulder.

98
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:12,336
...you so much. Happy birthday.

99
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:13,503
- Okay, take this thing now.
- All right.

100
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:16,089
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

101
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,721
Katie, take it easy.
Take it easy. It's dead.

102
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:23,805
You're a little monster.

103
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:29,019
- All right, all right, I got my camera.
- Here, let me help you, 'cause I don't...

104
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:30,354
- I want to see the tooth full throttle.
- Okay, all right.

105
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,521
This thing's coming out today.

106
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,857
- Is it okay if I push it a little?
- No, no, don't push it.

107
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,108
- Lower lip.
- Want some juice, babe?

108
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:36,276
- Down.
- Here.

109
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,361
Now...

110
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:38,779
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, orange juice.

111
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:41,698
That is... That is a good one!

112
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,285
- All right.
- Let's see this. Open up.

113
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,663
Don't push it with your tongue.
Let's see.

114
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:49,623
It's ready.

115
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,458
- I think it might be...
- It's ready.

116
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:54,628
You're gonna get a newjob as a dentist.

117
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,130
Thank you. You think I'm good?

118
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,800
Wrap it in a tissue, put it in your pocket,

119
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,135
and bring it home for...

120
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,054
- The Tooth Fairy.
- The Tooth Fairy, that's right.

121
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,222
And we'll put it
under your pillow, tonight.

122
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,473
Wow. You like the Tooth Fairy, right?

123
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:07,641
We love the Tooth Fairy.

124
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:08,809
Why does he need a bowl?

125
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,060
Because he wants to eat.

126
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,144
He's hungry?

127
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,230
Kristi, Toby isn't real.

128
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:16,316
- Hey. It doesn't matter.
- Yes, he is.

129
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:35,419
My assistant Randy is currently
43 minutes late.

130
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,963
And this isn't the first time,
he's always late.

131
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,549
So, today we're gonna

132
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:44,511
play a little prank and see
if we can teach him a lesson.

133
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,770
- Come on around the front door.
- Come on, just open the garage.

134
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:56,481
Randy, I need your help, man.
Come around the front door.

135
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:57,566
Okay, okay.

136
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,735
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

137
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:03,280
- Where were you? What happened?
- Sorry I'm late. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

138
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,781
- Hey.
- I got blocked in.

139
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,032
- I'm really sorry.
- That's all right, man.

140
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:09,327
I had a leak in the house.
I was hoping you'd get here sooner.

141
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:12,038
I had a leak in the ceiling here.

142
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,832
- Really?
- Yeah. Here, push this up here.

143
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,875
It didn't rain last night.

144
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,959
Hold this for a second. I need your help.

145
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,670
It's been going like crazy.
And I don't know what to do,

146
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:20,380
- so I got that pole there.
- Why is it white?

147
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,257
- What?
- Why is it white?

148
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,927
I don't know. I think it's maybe
something with the paint on this.

149
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,638
Anyway, I gotta get some spackle.
I'll be back.

150
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:30,432
- Wait, you just want me to...
- Hang on.

151
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,642
- You want me to wait here and hold it?
- Thanks, Randy.

152
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:36,271
Wait, Dennis.
I'm just supposed to wait here? Dennis.

153
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,315
Dennis!

154
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,275
- Hey.
- Okay, girls, that's far enough.

155
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,154
Hey. No. Why don't you come on in
and hand me that ladder?

156
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
No.

157
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,907
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

158
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,618
You know you don't have to listen to
him. He's not even your real dad.

159
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:50,827
Who wants to go jump
on the trampoline?

160
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,496
- I do!
- Oh, come on.

161
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,914
- I have a new trick to show you.
- Okay.

162
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,749
Guys, come on.

163
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,167
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Ready for a surprise?

164
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,543
It better be a ladder.

165
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,587
We were playing outside.
What did we find, guys?

166
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,506
- A spider.
- Dennis.

167
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,174
- We've got a cute little spider.
- Dennis!

168
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,259
- Come on, man.
- Okay. Yeah?

169
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,345
- Do it, do it, do it, do it!
- All right.

170
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,805
Run!

171
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:14,559
- It wasn't even a spider.
- That really hurt. That really hurt.

172
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,023
- Hi.
- Big day today, right?

173
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,149
- Yep.
- What's today?

174
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,567
- Picture day.
- Picture day!

175
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:23,693
- Dennis, you're still in.
- Sorry.

176
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,487
- I was finishing my hair!
- This picture's for Grandma.

177
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:26,863
Smile.

178
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:29,991
All right!

179
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:31,535
- Okay...
- Kristi, come on!

180
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,161
Here it goes.

181
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,373
All right.

182
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,208
Cheese.

183
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:43,505
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- No, no, no. Seriously, like...

184
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,091
- Randy?
- Yeah.

185
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,928
Where did you find this girl?

186
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,098
I don't know. I didn't see her
at all throughout any of the wedding...

187
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:59,354
- That's because I'm so happy...
- "So happy for you."

188
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:00,814
I love my job, man.

189
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,316
- I should've got her number.
- Probably could've.

190
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,903
Randy, this is great stuff.
I can't use any of this, but it's great.

191
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,425
Jule?

192
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,236
Julie?

193
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,947
There it goes again.

194
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,039
Hello?

195
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:00,290
Julie?

196
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,642
I like this song!

197
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,020
Not bad.

198
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,357
That's pretty good.

199
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,111
Teddy? Did you fall down?

200
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,842
What was that?

201
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:12,505
- Hey.
- Hey.

202
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,340
What you doing?

203
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,842
Nothing. I was just looking around.

204
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,844
What... What...
You guys just get home?

205
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,012
Yeah.

206
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,514
- It was girls' day.
- I know. How was it?

207
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,516
- Was it fun?
- Great.

208
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:27,103
You just really snuck up on me there.

209
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,607
All right. It's time.

210
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,609
- Don't film this.
- Why not?

211
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:35,111
It's illegal.

212
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:36,613
Don't laugh.

213
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,532
We haven't even started smoking it,
and you're already paranoid.

214
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,451
It's illegal.
What if my kids find me? I'm a mother.

215
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,369
- Now relax.
- Seriously, Dennis.

216
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,537
Seriously, Julie.

217
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,956
Let's get really serious. Seriously.

218
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,041
- Shut up.
- Let's be serious.

219
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,002
- All right.
- Real, real, real big, big...

220
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,004
That was big.

221
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,674
Julie, do the voice.

222
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,802
Dennis.

223
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:00,970
What voice?

224
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,890
This voice?

225
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:10,355
Dennis, I can't believe
you're filming me smoke marijuana.

226
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,487
God, you're so beautiful.

227
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,822
Shut up.

228
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:23,660
I want to film us having sex.

229
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:28,790
Is that perverted?

230
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,335
- Is that weird?
- I don't know.

231
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,047
Was that a yes?

232
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,134
Okay.

233
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,011
- Really?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,186
Hey, there, pretty lady.

235
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:53,773
Stop. I don't know.

236
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:56,860
You sure... You sure you're up for this?

237
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,027
No.

238
00:12:58,154 --> 00:12:59,404
You know what? Don't answer that.

239
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,906
Hurry up, before I change my mind.

240
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,033
Okay, sorry.

241
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:07,996
All right.

242
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,588
What are you doing? What was that?

243
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:17,755
It's porno music.

244
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,842
Great. Classy.

245
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:26,598
Good start.

246
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,391
Good, right?

247
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,395
- All right.
- I don't know.

248
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,505
Relax. Just relax.

249
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,424
Don't worry about it.

250
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,639
Hey.

251
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,599
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- Relax.

252
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:29,911
- Yeah, what is that?
- I don't know.

253
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:46,844
It's an earthquake.

254
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,597
- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!

255
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,850
The girls. The girls!

256
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:55,019
Come on! Dennis!

257
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,261
Dennis. Oh, my God, I look so fat.

258
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,429
You don't look fat.

259
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,222
- Look at the size of me on top of you.
- You look beautiful.

260
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,349
You look like you can't breathe
'cause I'm sitting on top of you.

261
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,851
I want another shot
at doing one of these.

262
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,269
- Watch this.
- Dennis, you have to erase this.

263
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,770
Julie, watch, watch, watch.

264
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,522
- See that?
- What?

265
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,107
Did you see that in the corner?

266
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,818
Yeah, I see, like, dust.

267
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,778
- Dirt falling.
- No, Julie.

268
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:46,988
There's something there.

269
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,906
- You are crazy.
- There was something there.

270
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:50,033
Wait, you can see something there.

271
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,200
It's very cute,
but you're going a little crazy.

272
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:54,412
You're like one of those people
that see things, like in their food.

273
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,456
Like when people think
they see the Virgin Mary in their toast.

274
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,623
- That's you right now.
- That's hilarious.

275
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,917
This has to be erased
and this has to be erased.

276
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:02,170
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.

277
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:05,131
I'm late. I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.

278
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,842
You know,
you're going to regret saying that.

279
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:08,968
Doubt it.

280
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:11,179
I don't think you can go a day
without having sex, personally.

281
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,638
Don't dare me.

282
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,224
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.

283
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,311
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.

284
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,855
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.

285
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,398
I know, it's my car!

286
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,775
I got the earthquake.

287
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,693
- Did you really?
- On tape.

288
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:26,944
It's scary, right? Is that Julie?

289
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,112
It's nothing, it's nothing.

290
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,614
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?

291
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,949
Yeah. I got...
This weird thing happened after...

292
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,117
She let you make a sex tape?

293
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,161
Yeah, but it got interrupted
by the earthquake.

294
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,829
I wouldn't have let
anything interrupt that.

295
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,040
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?

296
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,167
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.

297
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,543
Check this out. Ready?

298
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,337
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.

299
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,463
Okay.

300
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:46,589
I'm gonna take the color out.

301
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,467
It looks like dust is falling on something.

302
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,260
It looks like a figure, right?

303
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:52,553
- You see that?
- Yeah.

304
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,305
Did you catch that?

305
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,681
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?

306
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,183
- It moved, right?
- What was that?

307
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,851
I don't know. Check it out.

308
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,395
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.

309
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,106
You know, I've been hearing
these noises in the girls' room lately.

310
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,525
I don't know. I feel like it's...

311
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,984
Something weird's going on.

312
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,320
- Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.

313
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,699
Hey, I wanted to talk to you...

314
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,826
Dennis!

315
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:15,952
Sorry! Sorry.

316
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Oh, my God!

317
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,246
Sorry.

318
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,289
You mind if I set up
a couple cameras around the house?

319
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,208
I'm not going to talk to you right now.

320
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,293
Okay, I'll... I'll take that as a yes?

321
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,130
- I hate you!
- Okay. Love you, too.

322
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,716
How long do the tapes last?

323
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,051
About six hours each.

324
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:34,178
So you have to change
them every six hours?

325
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,513
Yes.

326
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,724
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?

327
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,935
- Okay. Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...

328
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,645
Keep going.

329
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,022
- Can I see it?
- Sure.

330
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,233
Here. Come here. See it?

331
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,401
Yeah.

332
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,403
Pretty cool, right?

333
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,321
So, what are you trying to see?

334
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,240
Anything unusual or strange.

335
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,242
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.

336
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,910
- Kristi?
- Yeah?

337
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,579
Don't touch the camera or anything.

338
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,164
Katie, just leave it alone.

339
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,255
- Dennis.
- What?

340
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,506
Really?

341
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,759
Don't you think
you're overreacting a little?

342
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,052
This is a new house.

343
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,221
It shouldn't be making these noises.

344
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,349
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.

345
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:23,895
No...

346
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,482
This is not gonna work here.

347
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,942
Like, what do you think
you're gonna catch?

348
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,028
Whatever's in our house.

349
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,657
Right, 'cause there's
something here watching us.

350
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,204
Well, there's definitely something.

351
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,458
I... I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.

352
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,126
Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.

353
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,294
I feel a camera.

354
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:52,006
The earthquake, and all those...

355
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,258
I don't know,
stuff that's been happening and...

356
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,219
I don't know, I just...

357
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,596
No, it's totally normal.

358
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,435
Bye, camera.

359
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,523
Good night, camera.

360
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,420
Yeah?

361
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,465
Yeah, probably.

362
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,552
In their bedroom.

363
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,305
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.

364
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,641
It's okay.

365
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,937
Why?

366
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,986
Yeah, kind of.

367
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,821
He's very sweet.

368
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,796
Yeah, I saw that.

369
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,007
I watched some of the tapes
on the camera

370
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,385
and I saw you
talking to somebody late last night.

371
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:05,181
If you saw me talking to somebody,
it would be Toby.

372
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,975
Toby's your friend?

373
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,644
Yes. He's my friend.

374
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,854
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?

375
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,105
Secrets.

376
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,524
He's big?

377
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,526
So, is he old, like Grandma,

378
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,570
or is he young, like you?

379
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,199
He's old, like Grandma.

380
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,284
And what does he look like?

381
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,037
Is he tall? Is he fat?

382
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,914
He's tall. He's tall.

383
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,917
Don't call him fat.

384
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,128
Kristi, when you say that
if you tell one of your secrets

385
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:39,340
that you'll be in trouble with Toby,
what does that mean?

386
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,842
Well, I won't be safe.

387
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,971
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?

388
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,098
No.

389
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,142
But I won't be safe.

390
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,520
That means, I will be, like...

391
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,232
Be in very, very big trouble.

392
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,484
Big trouble.

393
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,735
- You saw her.
- That's how it is.

394
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,237
It was like he was actually there, right?

395
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,363
I know.

396
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,865
Because that's how active
kids' imaginations are.

397
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,991
It's crazy.

398
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,326
I mean, imagination is one thing.

399
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,036
She got up in the middle of the night.

400
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,580
I mean, it's a little odd
that she got up in the middle...

401
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,166
You haven't been around kids
for that long. They do weird things.

402
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,919
They... Katie used to get up
in the middle of the night

403
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,629
and she used to sleep on the toilet.

404
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:19,922
What?

405
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,173
Okay? I'm serious.

406
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,299
Really?

407
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:26,011
Yes. Toby is a phase and he's going to
be gone in a couple weeks.

408
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,138
I know it.

409
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,848
How many hours of footage
do you have?

410
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,976
This is the job, man. I got two cameras,

411
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,437
six hours each. Twelve hours.

412
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,939
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah. Got to do it, man.

413
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,066
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.

414
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:41,193
Yes. Now, please,
I'm trying to concentrate.

415
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,196
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.

416
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,781
- Hey, Julie.
- ...going?

417
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,032
Good.

418
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:50,369
You want to step into my office
and do some work with me or...

419
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,455
No. You find anything?

420
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,666
Yes, actually. We did find something.

421
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,545
We found that
your family sleeps all night.

422
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,713
Very funny, Randy.

423
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,131
- Keep up the good work.
- Okay.

424
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,049
I love you with all of my heart and soul.

425
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,801
I love you, too.

426
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,179
It should either be called
Back to the Past...

427
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,430
Present. Back to the Present.

428
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:10,723
- No, no.
- End of story.

429
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,641
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.

430
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,685
Let's Get Back to the Present, maybe.

431
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,562
But Back to the Past...

432
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:17,688
Back to the Present.

433
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,818
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

434
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,532
- Was that... That's it.
- What the hell?

435
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,658
It's happening again.

436
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,035
Come on.

437
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,336
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

438
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,349
It's in your closet.

439
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,438
Are you getting that?

440
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,564
Open it.

441
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,733
- Are you getting it?
- Yeah, I'm gettin' it.

442
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,716
Holy shit!

443
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,928
Holy shit! That's not funny.

444
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,265
- Oh, my God. You're both crazy.
- I got you guys so bad.

445
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,642
- I got you.
- You're both crazy.

446
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,936
I got you good.
I got you, too. Are you okay?

447
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:40,479
Just go ahead
and take your crap right there,

448
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,481
'cause I nearly crapped my pants.

449
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,525
Holy fuck!
You almost gave me a heart attack.

450
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,193
Oh, my God, get away!

451
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,987
- Get away from me.
- Are you okay?

452
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,238
Get away. I hate you.

453
00:24:56,413 --> 00:25:00,624
Wow. Look at that tent.

454
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,668
Gosh. I like this tent.

455
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,212
"...and disguised his voice to sound
like Little Red Riding Hood.

456
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:08,173
"The poor old woman, before she could
even scream, the wolf gobbled her up."

457
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,135
Hello. Hey, guys.

458
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,720
- How you doing?
- Good.

459
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,513
- Good.
- That's a little bright.

460
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:15,639
I'm sorry.

461
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,684
- Guys? I got you a little...
- Give it to me.

462
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,686
Hey, guys. Don't tell Mom, okay?

463
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,062
- Okay.
- All right.

464
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:23,439
What are you guys doing?

465
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,649
You'll see.
We've got a little surprise for you.

466
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:28,444
- One, two, three!
- ...two, three!

467
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,155
Come here.

468
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,033
Here, tickle torture,
tickle torture, tickle torture!

469
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,162
That's enough.
You guys are locked in the dungeon.

470
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,663
All right. Good night, girls. I love you.

471
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,498
- Love you, Dennis.
- Love you.

472
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,504
Dennis. Dennis.

473
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,964
- What?
- Listen.

474
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,842
What?

475
00:27:14,926 --> 00:27:17,136
I think the girls came inside.

476
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,889
I'll go check on them. I got it.

477
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:38,574
Girls?

478
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:08,687
Dennis.

479
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:12,775
Dennis?

480
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,760
Don't do that to me.

481
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:40,969
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- You scared me.

482
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,807
Did you check on them?

483
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,190
Why is this door locked?
Did you lock this?

484
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,949
What's the matter?

485
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,450
We're just checking on you guys.

486
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:04,701
Move that light.

487
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,120
We're gonna move inside, okay?

488
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:08,038
- I want to stay here.
- Why?

489
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,706
I'm sorry. It's gonna be fun inside,
too, though.

490
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,083
Come on. Get your stuff.
We're gonna camp inside.

491
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,292
- Mommy. Why?
- What?

492
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,418
Dennis, will you film me?

493
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:14,962
- Yep.
- I wanna show you something.

494
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:18,882
You know Spud Webb?
One, two, three, slam dunk!

495
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,717
Very impressive. Very good.

496
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:22,010
Thank you. Thank you.

497
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,179
Katie, are you sure you didn't sneak
into the house last night?

498
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,597
My gosh, I pinky swear,

499
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:26,807
- I did not go into the house.
- Okay.

500
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,517
You wanna do me a favor?
Can you tell your mom that?

501
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,104
Where's Dennis?

502
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,481
He's out, buying more tapes.

503
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,193
With your credit card?

504
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,529
Mom.

505
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:43,782
He doesn't have any money.

506
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,492
That is not true.

507
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:47,161
The girls love him.

508
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:51,456
I mean, they just about think
he's the coolest guy ever.

509
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,960
I mean, I really, really do like him.
I mean that.

510
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,838
It's just that the girls miss their father.

511
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,381
I don't know.

512
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:03,177
I wish he were
a little more financially secure.

513
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,179
He is financially secure, Mom.
He has a job.

514
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:07,514
- He shoots wedding videos.
- No. That's... No.

515
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,267
He has his own business.

516
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,643
You know? It's a whole different thing.

517
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:13,270
My God, Mom. I just told you,

518
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,314
I don't want to have any more kids.

519
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,983
I'm not gonna get pregnant.

520
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,401
You always said
you wanted a big family.

521
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,322
I changed my mind, okay?
I have two beautiful girls.

522
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:24,823
You always wanted a son.

523
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,243
I'm happy with the way things are.
Let's go.

524
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,719
What the...

525
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,556
Fuck.

526
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:56,099
This is great. Hang on.

527
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:59,061
That's great! Katie, that's great.
You're doing really good.

528
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,687
- Thank you.
- Let her go, Jule.

529
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,564
Dennis, I totally believe in this shit.

530
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,358
Randy, watch the language.

531
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:05,650
All right, nice and slow.

532
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,861
My brother saw one once.

533
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,071
- Really?
- Yeah.

534
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,197
What's Bloody Mary?

535
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,407
You don't know what Bloody Mary is?

536
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,701
It's where you go in the bathroom

537
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:17,454
and you say "Bloody Mary" three times
in the mirror and then you see a ghost.

538
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:18,663
Dennis, I wanna play Bloody Mary.

539
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,123
Nothing, don't worry. It's okay.

540
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,249
You say Bloody Mary three times.

541
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,417
I want to play!
I want to see a ghost.

542
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:25,337
I'm just saying you're missing
half of the stuff in the house

543
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,546
without cameras down there.

544
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:28,048
I know. You don't have to tell me.

545
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,926
Like put it up in the corner, like,
rack it up in the corner or something?

546
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,637
It just doesn't work. It just...

547
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,972
It's not a wide enough angle.

548
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:38,100
And I don't even...
They don't even make lenses that wide.

549
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,268
Mirrors.

550
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,436
You could use mirrors.

551
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,984
- This thing is so cool.
- Pretty cool, right?

552
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,820
It's awesome. Wow!

553
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:54,783
Look, you got it
balanced out and everything, too.

554
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:56,952
What is that?

555
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,370
I got to work out some kinks.

556
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,126
Oh, man.

557
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,465
- Hi.
- Hey.

558
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,717
What is that?

559
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,177
Check it out.

560
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:15,720
My new thing.

561
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,014
- It's pretty cool, right?
- Yeah.

562
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:21,601
- What... What is it?
- I took your fan...

563
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:24,855
And basically, took apart...

564
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,983
Basically, the oscillator
on your fan allows me to see

565
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,985
both in the living room
and in the kitchen.

566
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,487
Cool. Wait, what? You broke my fan?

567
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,365
I can put it back together.

568
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,992
Okay, MacGyver.

569
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,911
It's cool, right?

570
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:41,621
This way I can...

571
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,322
Kristi, what are you doing?

572
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,785
- Nothing.
- Go back to bed. It's really late.

573
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:59,884
Hey, babe, what are you doing up here?

574
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,470
Painting.

575
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,725
Don't you want to play outside?

576
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,602
Not really.

577
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,021
How about your friend Toby?
Do you still talk to him?

578
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:12,188
Yeah.

579
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:15,609
Did he wake you up?

580
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,444
No.

581
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:19,154
Did he tell you to come downstairs?

582
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,280
No.

583
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:25,035
You know you can tell me, right?

584
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,287
He told me not to talk about it.

585
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,956
Why don't you just ask him yourself?

586
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,375
He's standing right next to you.

587
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,135
I don't see him.

588
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,304
He's there.

589
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,930
Hey, thanks for getting these, man.

590
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,057
Yeah, of course.

591
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:49,434
- This is good stuff.
- Thanks.

592
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:50,977
- Randy...
- Yeah?

593
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:52,687
Did you check this out?

594
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,731
No, I don't have a library card.

595
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,691
You stole these?

596
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:58,526
I didn't steal them, Dennis.

597
00:37:58,611 --> 00:38:00,195
You told me to get the books,
I got you the books.

598
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,863
It's what a library is. It's for borrowing.

599
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,073
That's what "library"
means in Spanish...

600
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:05,450
It means, "Borrow book store."

601
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:08,495
Malevolent Entities. What is this one?

602
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,373
I don't know.
I looked through it for a second.

603
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,666
It had some creepy pictures...

604
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,542
This stuff is creepy.

605
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,419
Hey.

606
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:18,922
It's your sister and her friends.

607
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,175
Is that a joke?
What, was that supposed to be funny?

608
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,301
Playing field hockey.

609
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:27,055
Says, "Kids are susceptible
to spiritual contact."

610
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:29,391
Okay. And?

611
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,726
Well, the whole thing
with Kristi and her imaginary friend.

612
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:34,020
Remember, I was telling you
the crazy stuff started happening

613
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:35,939
only when she started talking
to her imaginary friend.

614
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:38,316
I mean, it must want something.
That's what...

615
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:40,318
You know, that's what the book says.

616
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:43,446
They don't just stick around
for no reason. It wants something.

617
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:44,864
What does it want?

618
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,409
Well, the book says
it feeds off of your fear.

619
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,710
Hey, Kristi.

620
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,212
- Kristi.
- Yeah?

621
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:00,964
- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.

622
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,133
Here. What are you doing?

623
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,969
- Playing with my soccer ball?
- Yeah.

624
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:08,138
Kristi, that's mine. Kristi!

625
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,768
Kristi, come on. Kristi, come help me.

626
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:15,019
What are we doing?

627
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:17,439
- We're gonna play Bloody Mary.
- Why?

628
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:19,149
Because I wanna try to catch the ghost.

629
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,650
Okay. I think it's on.

630
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:24,279
So, how you play is you say
"Bloody Mary" three times into the mirror

631
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:27,198
and then her dead body's
supposed to appear

632
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,617
- in the mirror and try to kill you.
- Stop! Stop!

633
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,494
Stop, Katie.

634
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:35,123
So, now what do we do?

635
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,083
We have to say "Bloody Mary".

636
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:43,548
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

637
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:44,716
Bloody Mary.

638
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,136
- Kristi, I said three times, not four.
- Sorry.

639
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,557
- I'm scared, Katie.
- We have to be quiet.

640
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,561
- Guys...
- My gosh, Mom! You scared me.

641
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:59,314
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. We're just playing a game.

642
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,734
Okay. Grandma just got here.
Go say hi.

643
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,611
- You moved his camera?
- Yeah.

644
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:06,112
- Is it taping?
- I'll pick it up, I promise.

645
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:07,906
Yeah. We gotta move it
before he comes home

646
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,783
'cause he's gonna be mad.

647
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,659
- You guys wanna go to the pool?
- Yeah.

648
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:12,994
You wanna go to the pool, Grandma?

649
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:29,631
God damn it.

650
00:42:58,035 --> 00:43:00,244
- Mom?
- Oh, my God.

651
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:01,913
Are you okay? Holy shit.

652
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:04,374
Mommy, what happened?

653
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,584
- Stay upstairs. Stay upstairs.
- What happened?

654
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:07,752
Don't come down here.

655
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:09,504
- There's glass on the floor. Stay there.
- Are you hurt?

656
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:14,509
I have no idea, I have no idea.

657
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:20,139
Looks fine, right? It didn't even break.

658
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,017
That's good.

659
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:24,811
- What happened?
- It just fell. I didn't...

660
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:26,312
What do you mean, what happened?
I was in there.

661
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,441
- Hi, Kristi.
- Hey.

662
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,860
- Say hi to the camera.
- Hey.

663
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:34,821
- Can I join you guys?
- Sure.

664
00:43:34,905 --> 00:43:36,155
- I can?
- Yeah.

665
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,782
Okay, great.

666
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,450
I'm gonna set my camera here, okay?

667
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:41,327
- Okay.
- Just keep it out of the way.

668
00:43:41,412 --> 00:43:43,871
Wait. Why are you filming this?

669
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:47,750
It's just like,
I'm testing out my, like, new camera

670
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:50,461
and, you know, no reason.

671
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:52,630
Don't sit there. That's Toby's spot.

672
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:56,008
Sorry. Is Toby sitting there right now?

673
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:57,385
Okay. Sorry.

674
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,886
Sorry, Toby.

675
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:05,351
Does Teddy need help with his tea?
He looks thirsty.

676
00:44:05,436 --> 00:44:07,061
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Teddy.

677
00:44:07,146 --> 00:44:09,021
Here. He can't reach 'em.

678
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:10,231
Okay.

679
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:15,403
Wow. He was thirsty. See, I told you.

680
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,948
And she keeps falling.

681
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:20,700
Poke.

682
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:24,370
So, Kristi, what was the last thing
that Toby said to you?

683
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:26,414
Like...

684
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:30,084
- Anything?
- Yeah.

685
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:31,961
- No?
- Secrets.

686
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:34,964
Secrets. Regular stuff. In her sink?

687
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,591
Yeah. Sorry.

688
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:38,384
That... Did you... Did you...

689
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:40,636
Did he say something just now?

690
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,098
No, I just put my hand on him.

691
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,018
And he didn't like that.

692
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,020
He doesn't like that, when you...

693
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,438
No.

694
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:53,191
Sorry, Toby. It was a mistake, right?

695
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:54,859
Yeah.

696
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:58,738
- What?
- Nothing.

697
00:44:58,822 --> 00:45:00,031
- What?
- Never mind.

698
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:01,866
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.

699
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,034
It's okay, you can tell me.

700
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:07,538
Kristi, why is Dennis's camera here?

701
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:10,374
Because me and Toby
were having a little tea party

702
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:11,626
and he was filming us.

703
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,795
- I'm not!
- Yes, you are, Kristi.

704
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:16,339
Only babies have imaginary friends.

705
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:19,217
He is real.

706
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:21,636
Hey, Kristi! Kristi's such a baby! Baby!

707
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,929
Katie, stop it!

708
00:45:23,013 --> 00:45:24,138
Well, you're being a baby!

709
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:25,264
Only babies have imaginary friends.

710
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:27,725
No, I'm not! He's right in there.

711
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,145
In there? Toby, come out!

712
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,356
Toby, come out!

713
00:45:35,651 --> 00:45:37,151
Toby!

714
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:41,489
Okay, I'm gonna go in.

715
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,157
Katie, you shouldn't do that.

716
00:45:43,659 --> 00:45:45,201
Katie! Don't go in there.

717
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:48,913
- You shouldn't do that.
- Well, I am.

718
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,792
Toby, come out.

719
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:55,795
Toby...

720
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:57,338
Katie.

721
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,799
Kristi! What are you doing?

722
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,217
Open the door!

723
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:03,094
You shouldn't do that.

724
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:05,137
Kristi, open this door!

725
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:06,472
- It's not me!
- Kristi!

726
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:07,640
- Girls!
- Open the door!

727
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:10,393
- What is this yelling? What is going on?
- I'm not doing that.

728
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:12,311
Stop fighting right this second.

729
00:46:12,396 --> 00:46:13,437
Why's Dennis's camera on the floor?

730
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:14,689
She locked me in there.

731
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,232
- Katie, you can't touch his stuff.
- Kristi, why...

732
00:46:16,525 --> 00:46:17,483
Stop fighting right this second.

733
00:46:17,568 --> 00:46:19,068
- Mom, she locked me in there!
- I don't want to hear it.

734
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:20,778
- Come on, come on.
- Then who locked me in there?

735
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:21,821
Toby did.

736
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:23,447
Yeah, like Toby locked me in there.

737
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:47,680
She's gonna be here any minute.

738
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,390
See? There she is.

739
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:51,976
Mommy, Lisa's here!

740
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,644
Okay!

741
00:46:57,274 --> 00:47:00,276
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi! How are you?

742
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,736
Good.

743
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:05,031
- I wanna show you something upstairs.
- Hi, Lisa.

744
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:06,449
Wait, what are you showing me?

745
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,075
I got some new beads for my birthday.

746
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,453
Beads! Let's see 'em.

747
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:12,246
Hi, Kristi. How are you?

748
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:13,372
Hey.

749
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:15,791
What's that?

750
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:17,335
Don't mind this.

751
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:19,879
You know Dennis and his cameras,
he just puts them...

752
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,005
Just ignore it.

753
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,173
8:30 bedtime?

754
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:23,716
No, no, no, 10:00.

755
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,134
- 8:30. Nice try.
- Mommy, please.

756
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:26,260
9:30?

757
00:47:26,345 --> 00:47:27,595
- 9:00.
- 9:45.

758
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,431
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, guys. Love you.

759
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,350
Look, it made a triangle.

760
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:39,065
- You ready?
- Yeah.

761
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:41,108
- Good night, girls!
- Good night.

762
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,569
- See you later.
- Bye, Julie. Bye, Dennis.

763
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:50,743
Are you tired?

764
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,578
- Not really.
- No?

765
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,497
Can you tell us a story?

766
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:57,249
Sure. What kind of story?

767
00:47:57,376 --> 00:47:58,668
A ghost story.

768
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:01,087
Ghost story? With a ghost.

769
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:03,756
Okay, let's think.

770
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,763
I'm a ghost!

771
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:13,057
Hello, Dennis! You found the ghost.

772
00:48:14,768 --> 00:48:16,185
Comin' to get you.

773
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:18,938
Got you!

774
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,613
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, sweetie.

775
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:21,792
Hi, Dennis.

776
00:52:57,259 --> 00:52:58,676
- Hi.
- Hey!

777
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,843
Hi!

778
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:02,346
- How'd it go?
- Fine, it was good.

779
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,348
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they were great.

780
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,016
The girls were...
Give you any trouble, or...

781
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:07,851
No, no, no, no, it was good.

782
00:53:07,936 --> 00:53:09,770
But my mom's meeting me,
so if I could just...

783
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,855
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, give her some money.

784
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,107
Here you go.

785
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:14,191
Thank you.

786
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:15,276
You're sure everything was good?

787
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,360
Yeah, no. Thank you, guys.

788
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:17,903
- Okay.
- Bye.

789
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:23,450
Okay, bye. Thanks.

790
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:29,373
I don't know.

791
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:30,457
- That was weird.
- Yeah.

792
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:32,913
It's so high.

793
00:55:45,093 --> 00:55:46,301
Promise?

794
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:49,221
Okay.

795
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,039
What are you doing?

796
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:19,710
- Nothing.
- Why are you up?

797
00:56:21,171 --> 00:56:22,463
Why are you up?

798
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:24,465
Nothing.

799
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:30,929
Kristi, go to bed. It's late.

800
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:42,774
- Is that the babysitter?
- Yeah, that's Lisa.

801
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:44,026
How come I never met her?

802
00:56:44,152 --> 00:56:45,194
I'll put in a good word.

803
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,196
- See the sheet?
- Yeah.

804
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,655
Watch this.

805
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:53,827
- Gone.
- Holy fuck.

806
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:56,997
Am I... Am I right?

807
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,374
Holy...

808
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,876
- Did you see that?
- ...fuck!

809
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:05,631
I'm not crazy, right? I'm not crazy.

810
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,383
That just happened.

811
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:09,968
Holy!

812
00:57:10,053 --> 00:57:11,136
What the fuck is that?

813
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:12,554
I don't know.

814
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,890
- What is that?
- I don't know.

815
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:16,225
I'm telling you, it's...

816
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:18,227
And she didn't say anything at all?

817
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:20,229
She left the room, like...

818
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:22,064
Did you show Julie?

819
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:26,401
No, man. What, are you kidding?
She would flip out.

820
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,403
She would go nuts, and, you know,

821
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:31,073
she'd make me take
the cameras down, and I can't do that.

822
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:32,741
I really want to figure out
what this thing wants.

823
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:34,409
Got to keep taping this shit,
though, man.

824
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,078
I know. I am.

825
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:37,746
- You got to keep taping this shit.
- I know.

826
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:39,331
She got blown in the face.

827
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:40,874
Yeah, yeah.

828
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:13,342
No.

829
00:59:14,844 --> 00:59:17,346
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

830
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:19,681
I'm going to bed.

831
00:59:44,207 --> 00:59:45,290
What the...

832
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:56,051
What the fuck?

833
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,560
Hey, how's she feeling?

834
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:08,897
We need to go to the doctor
'cause she's burning up.

835
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:10,524
Oh, no.

836
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:12,567
- Yeah, she's really...
- She's really that bad?

837
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:13,902
- Yeah, it's bad.
- All right.

838
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:15,153
It's like, I've taken it a couple times.

839
01:00:15,238 --> 01:00:16,905
Do you want me to go with you or...

840
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:19,157
Well, I mean, I don't know.
Who's gonna watch Katie?

841
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:20,367
I can call Randy.

842
01:00:25,915 --> 01:00:27,082
- Hey, man.
- Hey, hey.

843
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:28,583
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problemo.

844
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:30,168
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi!

845
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:31,336
Randy, thank you so much.

846
01:00:31,421 --> 01:00:33,171
We're gonna be
at the hospital for a little bit.

847
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:34,339
Okay.

848
01:00:34,424 --> 01:00:35,674
Anything you guys want...

849
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:37,259
- I know where everything is.
- Okay, great.

850
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:38,510
- Yeah.
- All right.

851
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:39,678
Bye! Love you. Bye, Kristi!

852
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:41,430
You have everything?
You have papers and insurance?

853
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:42,597
Yeah, I have it.

854
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:43,765
- Thanks a lot.
- Love you. Bye.

855
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,517
- I'll lock the door.
- Okay, thanks.

856
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:46,601
- Thanks again.
- I'll lock it.

857
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:48,854
All right, be good, Katie. See you.

858
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,775
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.

859
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,110
So what's wrong with Kristi?

860
01:00:55,236 --> 01:00:57,195
It's like a really high fever
or something like that.

861
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,698
Is it contagious?

862
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:01,616
I don't think so. I haven't gotten sick.

863
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,118
Okay, good.

864
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,373
What do you want to do?

865
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:09,958
Can we play Bloody Mary?

866
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:12,210
I have no idea what you're talking about.

867
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:13,378
Seriously?

868
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:15,464
I really don't think
this is a good idea, Katie.

869
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,048
You made a promise.
You have to do it.

870
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:19,134
- Can't we just play, like, doll house...
- Get the camera!

871
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,969
...or somethin'?

872
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,430
Sorry, Dennis. Not my idea.

873
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:25,891
Come on.

874
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,476
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

875
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:29,311
So you say, "Bloody Mary" three times.

876
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:30,896
And then you wait a little bit

877
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,230
and then you turn the lights back on

878
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:33,815
and then you're supposed
to see her body in the mirror

879
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,066
and she's gonna try to kill you.

880
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:37,068
Try and kill you. Good game.

881
01:01:37,153 --> 01:01:38,236
Yep.

882
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:39,654
I don't know why you wanna play this.

883
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:41,406
One of us is gonna be dead
by the end of it.

884
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:43,325
I guess it's a one-time game.
Okay, let's do it.

885
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:52,000
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

886
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,134
Randy!

887
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:03,345
Nothing happened.

888
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:04,846
You turned the light on too soon.

889
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:06,181
Come on, Katie. This is stupid.

890
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:08,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave!

891
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:11,353
Let's just go play doll house
or something.

892
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,771
No, you didn't do it right.

893
01:02:12,855 --> 01:02:14,022
What did I not do right?

894
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:16,274
You need to keep the light off longer.

895
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:18,026
Okay. Okay.

896
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:20,195
All right. You wanna play Bloody Mary?

897
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:22,197
- Let's play Bloody Mary.
- Okay, ready?

898
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,698
You're not gonna
see anybody play Bloody Mary

899
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:26,326
like I'm about to play Bloody Mary.

900
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:34,543
- Bloody Mary.
- Bloody Mary.

901
01:02:44,637 --> 01:02:46,471
Okay, can I turn it on now?

902
01:02:47,014 --> 01:02:48,890
- Quiet.
- Sorry. Sorry.

903
01:02:53,354 --> 01:02:55,021
How about now?

904
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:58,316
Wait, wait.

905
01:02:58,401 --> 01:03:00,694
- What?
- Did you hear that?

906
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:05,073
What was that?

907
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,075
I know. I heard it, too.

908
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:14,207
Holy shit!

909
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:18,503
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?

910
01:03:18,588 --> 01:03:20,338
Huh?

911
01:03:20,423 --> 01:03:21,506
Are you okay?

912
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:22,674
Yeah.

913
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,676
- Does it hurt?
- No.

914
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,220
I just scratched myself or something.

915
01:03:29,098 --> 01:03:30,181
Did you hear that?

916
01:03:30,266 --> 01:03:31,349
Yeah.

917
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:33,560
It's okay. Nothing...

918
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:36,688
Close the door. It's okay. It's all right.

919
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:38,106
It's all right. It's okay.

920
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:40,775
I don't want to die! Randy, I'm scared!

921
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:44,279
Holy shit! It's okay!

922
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:46,364
Randy, I'm scared!

923
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:47,449
Holy fuck!

924
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:58,543
You okay? You okay?

925
01:03:58,628 --> 01:03:59,711
Oh, my God.

926
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:01,046
It's all right.

927
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:03,465
Dear God. Please, God.

928
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:05,050
Please, God, be with me.

929
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:08,470
It's okay! It's okay!

930
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:10,055
I don't want to play this.

931
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:11,473
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

932
01:04:11,557 --> 01:04:14,059
I'm fine. I'm fine.

933
01:04:14,143 --> 01:04:15,310
Stay here.

934
01:04:15,436 --> 01:04:16,978
I don't wanna play anymore.

935
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:18,438
It's okay, it's okay.

936
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:23,985
It's okay.

937
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,959
Holy fuck!

938
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:43,630
Okay.

939
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:45,256
- Nothing happened.
- You okay?

940
01:04:45,341 --> 01:04:46,508
Nothing. You're fine.

941
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:48,093
- I wanna get out of here.
- It's okay, all right.

942
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:50,345
We're gonna get out of here.

943
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:52,347
Come on, Randy! Come on, Randy!

944
01:04:54,183 --> 01:04:55,684
Stay here.

945
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,980
Dear Lord, be with me,
please, be with me.

946
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:24,629
- Randy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
- It's okay.

947
01:05:24,714 --> 01:05:26,297
- Come here, come here.
- I'm sorry!

948
01:05:26,382 --> 01:05:27,799
It's okay. Huh?

949
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:30,051
- Please, please, don't tell.
- It's okay, it's just like an earthquake.

950
01:05:30,136 --> 01:05:31,845
I'm not gonna tell. I'm not gonna tell.

951
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:33,388
It's all right. It's okay.

952
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:34,556
I wanna go downstairs!

953
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:35,974
Yeah, let's go downstairs.

954
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:37,392
Fuck.

955
01:05:49,864 --> 01:05:52,574
Randy, Randy,
where are you going, man? Relax.

956
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:54,075
Randy, Randy, take it easy.

957
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:56,911
Randy. What... What are you doing?

958
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,831
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm getting all my stuff.

959
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:01,583
What... What are you
getting your stuff for, man?

960
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:02,834
- Relax. Sit down.
- Dennis.

961
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:04,502
Get the camera out of my face.

962
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:07,422
I told you,
I felt something in the room with us

963
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:09,674
and then I felt a claw
dig into my side, okay?

964
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:10,759
Okay, okay.
When you say "something..."

965
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:11,926
Great interview.

966
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:13,928
- No, Dennis, I'm done. Fuck.
- When you say...

967
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:15,597
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home!

968
01:06:15,723 --> 01:06:17,599
Look at the fuckin' books.
This isn't, you know,

969
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:19,768
Casper, the fuckin' friendly ghost
you're chasing, man.

970
01:06:19,894 --> 01:06:21,436
- I'm sorry you got hurt.
- This thing is dangerous!

971
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,605
- I'm sorry you got hurt, okay?
- Jesus fucking Christ!

972
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:26,608
I'm sorry, but... What are you
gonna do? You're just gonna quit?

973
01:06:26,734 --> 01:06:28,276
You're acting ridiculous. Relax!

974
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:29,527
Dennis, no, you're acting ridiculous

975
01:06:29,612 --> 01:06:30,695
if you're not gonna get the fuck out.

976
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:32,781
You have to tell Julie, okay?

977
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:35,450
Just watch the fucking tape, Dennis!

978
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:01,976
- What's up?
- Hey.

979
01:07:02,102 --> 01:07:03,394
What?

980
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:06,481
I need to talk to you.

981
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:08,566
- Okay.
- All right, sit down.

982
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:12,320
Here. Sit down, Jule.
Okay, where do I begin?

983
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:14,322
...from the '30s. Look at the necklaces.

984
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:17,242
That's crazy. Yeah?

985
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:19,410
It's the same symbol.

986
01:07:19,495 --> 01:07:22,163
Isn't that the same symbol
from the girls' room?

987
01:07:22,248 --> 01:07:24,833
All right? These...
These women, they were...

988
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:26,584
- Oh, my God.
- ...part of a coven.

989
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:28,336
You're really something.

990
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,505
I... I... I really need to...
To tell you this, okay?

991
01:07:30,631 --> 01:07:32,131
Kristi!

992
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:35,301
You'd better run!

993
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:45,603
You sound crazy. Do you know that?

994
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:46,688
Hang on a second, all right?

995
01:07:46,814 --> 01:07:48,022
Do you know how crazy
you're starting to sound?

996
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:49,440
Would you just give me
a second to explain?

997
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:50,859
They would have these ceremonies

998
01:07:50,985 --> 01:07:53,194
and they would wait till the girls
were old enough to get pregnant

999
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,530
and then they would... They would...
They would take their sons.

1000
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:56,698
Right.

1001
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:58,950
And then they would brainwash them
and they didn't remember a thing.

1002
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:00,535
That explains it.
Dennis, I'm not listening to...

1003
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:01,870
Mom?

1004
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,052
- I need to show you something.
- It's all you do!

1005
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:19,220
There's shit...

1006
01:08:19,305 --> 01:08:20,388
You don't even spend
any time with us anymore.

1007
01:08:20,472 --> 01:08:22,056
You just sit here
and play with this shit all day long.

1008
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:23,892
- Could you just wait one second?
- It's like you're obsessed!

1009
01:08:24,018 --> 01:08:25,226
Just wait one second.
I need to show you this, okay?

1010
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:26,394
No, I can't. I can't wait.

1011
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,562
- No, no, no...
- I can't wait! I can't!

1012
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:28,646
- Why not?
- Because...

1013
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:29,814
Because Kristi's upset all the time...

1014
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:31,399
- Mommy?
- What the fuck? I don't...

1015
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:33,067
What? What? What?

1016
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:34,652
Toby pulled my hair.

1017
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:35,820
- What happened?
- Who?

1018
01:08:35,905 --> 01:08:37,572
Toby pulled my hair.

1019
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:38,740
This is your fault.

1020
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:40,825
Okay? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

1021
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,702
Hey... I didn't...

1022
01:08:44,413 --> 01:08:46,915
No more cameras.
No more ghosts. This ends tomorrow.

1023
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:49,876
Julie, I...
You gotta watch the fucking tape.

1024
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:51,539
Kristi.

1025
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:53,666
Wake up!

1026
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:58,880
Katie, go back to sleep.

1027
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:03,718
What was that?

1028
01:11:11,852 --> 01:11:13,394
What's happening?

1029
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:17,523
Kristi!

1030
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:19,525
Toby's here.

1031
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:25,990
I'm scared! Mom! Mommy!

1032
01:11:26,075 --> 01:11:27,325
- Mommy!
- Stop screaming!

1033
01:11:27,409 --> 01:11:29,660
It's okay! Just ignore it!

1034
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:31,412
Just ignore it!

1035
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:41,214
Mom!

1036
01:11:46,053 --> 01:11:47,178
Kristi!

1037
01:11:48,097 --> 01:11:50,264
Kristi, help me!

1038
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:53,101
Kristi!
Please... Please... Please help me!

1039
01:11:58,774 --> 01:11:59,857
Katie!

1040
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:03,694
Let her go! Let her go!

1041
01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:07,365
Toby, stop! Stop, Toby!

1042
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,203
I'll do it.

1043
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:13,871
Just let her go!

1044
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:26,551
I'm scared. I want Mommy!

1045
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:39,397
...to Grandma's house.

1046
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:40,648
No, we're not going
to Grandma's house, okay?

1047
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:41,816
Why?

1048
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,734
We're not going to Grandma's
because there's no Toby, sweetie.

1049
01:12:43,819 --> 01:12:45,820
- Yes, there...
- There's no Toby and there's no ghost.

1050
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:47,572
Hey, don't run away from me.

1051
01:12:47,656 --> 01:12:50,658
Hey. There's no ghost
and that's the end of it.

1052
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:53,161
I don't want to hear any more
of this talk, okay?

1053
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:54,328
Okay?

1054
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:05,173
- What'd she say?
- She said no.

1055
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:08,342
No. No. Mom, we're not coming over.

1056
01:13:09,303 --> 01:13:11,512
Okay? We're staying right here.

1057
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:16,267
Because I need
to get things back to normal.

1058
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,687
All right, Mom, I gotta go.
Someone's at the door, okay?

1059
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:22,023
I'll call you back. Yeah, okay.

1060
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:38,456
Hello?

1061
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,458
Weird.

1062
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,523
Dennis!

1063
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:07,652
Dennis! Dennis, get the girls!
We're getting out of here!

1064
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:14,492
Girls, wake up, we're here.
Wake up. We're here.

1065
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:17,662
Yay, we're here.

1066
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:18,955
There's Grandma.

1067
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:20,998
Mommy, I'm tired.

1068
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:27,630
Go park by the garage.

1069
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:36,305
Oh, God.

1070
01:14:37,516 --> 01:14:39,058
Are you okay?

1071
01:14:39,393 --> 01:14:40,685
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.

1072
01:14:40,769 --> 01:14:43,604
Hi, honey. Come on, go.
You go with your mom.

1073
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:46,774
I've got your sister. Come on. Come on.

1074
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:48,025
Mommy.

1075
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:51,737
Sleepy girl is what she is.

1076
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:54,365
Go on in the house. I've got apple pie

1077
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:58,494
and I've got... You want water, I know.

1078
01:14:58,578 --> 01:14:59,620
How're we doing?

1079
01:14:59,705 --> 01:15:01,038
Put the camera down
and come and eat some pie.

1080
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:02,164
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

1081
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:03,624
It makes me feel better to do something.

1082
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:05,293
- Okay. Okay.
- Feel useful.

1083
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:06,419
Are you okay?

1084
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:08,087
- How's it going, kiddo?
- What is going on?

1085
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:09,463
- Good.
- How you feeling?

1086
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:12,967
...not talk about it right now.
We can talk about it when...

1087
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:14,635
Just... Let's just drop it.

1088
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:22,268
- Hey, Kristi?
- What?

1089
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:25,730
Don't touch the painting, okay?
It's okay, I'm not mad.

1090
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,107
Do you like it?

1091
01:15:30,277 --> 01:15:31,444
What's the matter?

1092
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:34,071
Kristi! Come and get your pie!

1093
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,503
Hey, guys.

1094
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:52,131
What's going on?
You playing some dress-up?

1095
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:54,300
Doesn't she make a beautiful bride?

1096
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:55,926
- Very.
- Do you want to put this on her?

1097
01:15:56,011 --> 01:15:57,053
Beautiful.

1098
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:58,637
Try that.

1099
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,184
So, who's the lucky guy?

1100
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:04,352
Toby.

1101
01:16:04,436 --> 01:16:05,478
Wait. What did she say?

1102
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:07,271
- Let's go. It's bedtime, girls. Let's go.
- Just having fun.

1103
01:16:07,356 --> 01:16:08,397
- Julie...
- Mom.

1104
01:16:08,482 --> 01:16:10,566
Come on. I don't want to hear
Toby's name ever again. Okay?

1105
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:11,692
Julie, it's just pretend.

1106
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:12,818
That's it. He's done.
He's not in our lives.

1107
01:16:12,903 --> 01:16:13,944
- He's real. Toby is...
- Let's go.

1108
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:15,071
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Kristi...

1109
01:16:15,197 --> 01:16:16,238
Can you take them to bed, please?
Let's go.

1110
01:16:16,323 --> 01:16:17,406
Come on, sweetheart.

1111
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:18,532
Take Grandma's stuff off
and let's go to bed.

1112
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:20,242
Dennis and I are gonna be
right next door, okay?

1113
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:21,786
We're gonna leave
a light on and everything,

1114
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,246
so you can find us,
and everything's gonna be...

1115
01:16:24,331 --> 01:16:26,248
Gonna be fine, okay?
I love you so much.

1116
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:27,249
Love you.

1117
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:28,334
- Good night, guys.
- I love you so much.

1118
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:49,021
When are you gonna stop taping us?

1119
01:16:49,106 --> 01:16:51,232
Not until this thing's over.

1120
01:16:59,116 --> 01:17:01,117
When's your mom
gonna let us sleep in the same bed?

1121
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:05,996
I can't stop thinking about it. I can't.

1122
01:17:06,081 --> 01:17:07,289
I know.

1123
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:11,544
Just close your eyes
and try to get to sleep.

1124
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:14,505
Come here.

1125
01:17:15,841 --> 01:17:18,509
We can share a pillow, too. That's fine.

1126
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:15,733
Julie.

1127
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:20,905
Do you hear that?

1128
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:22,406
Like cars?

1129
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,493
- Sorry...
- It's my mom.

1130
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:30,247
She's always up at night.
She can't sleep.

1131
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:34,835
Oh, my God, she's so loud.

1132
01:18:36,004 --> 01:18:37,880
Do you want me to go check on her?

1133
01:18:37,964 --> 01:18:41,133
She's gonna wake the girls up.
I'll be right back.

1134
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:06,492
Julie?

1135
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,647
Julie!

1136
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:22,151
Girls?

1137
01:20:31,286 --> 01:20:32,453
Julie?

1138
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:38,083
Hey, Julie!

1139
01:21:17,457 --> 01:21:18,624
Hello?

1140
01:21:29,803 --> 01:21:31,261
What the fuck?

1141
01:21:35,392 --> 01:21:36,558
Julie?

1142
01:21:39,437 --> 01:21:40,562
Lois?

1143
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:00,582
What?

1144
01:22:12,804 --> 01:22:14,304
What the fuck?

1145
01:22:18,268 --> 01:22:19,435
Julie!

1146
01:23:17,243 --> 01:23:19,453
What the fuck?

1147
01:23:25,919 --> 01:23:27,878
Fuck. Oh, my God.

1148
01:23:32,008 --> 01:23:33,175
Julie!

1149
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:47,356
Julie?

1150
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:51,610
What's wrong?

1151
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:08,794
Fuck. Fuck.

1152
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:10,045
Julie?

1153
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,589
Get up.

1154
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:15,133
Mommy?

1155
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:20,013
Oh, Kristi! No, Kristi!

1156
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:22,558
- Dennis?
- Come here, come on. Let's go, Kristi.

1157
01:24:22,642 --> 01:24:24,643
What happened to Mommy?
Is she okay?

1158
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:27,396
Oh, shit. Come here.
Go, go.

1159
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,939
Dennis, I'm scared.

1160
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:30,148
It's okay. No, Kristi, don't talk.

1161
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:31,400
Is Mommy okay?

1162
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:32,818
Quiet, okay?

1163
01:24:32,902 --> 01:24:35,571
Be quiet.
Just don't, okay? Just quiet, okay?

1164
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:43,537
It's okay.

1165
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:57,968
Kristi, please, please, be quiet.

1166
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,851
I'm gonna go check, okay?

1167
01:25:05,935 --> 01:25:07,436
Stay here.

1168
01:25:14,903 --> 01:25:16,028
Come on, Kristi.

1169
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:17,195
What was that?

1170
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,656
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

1171
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,586
Come on, let's go.

1172
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,421
I'm scared.

1173
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:36,965
We're gonna get out of here.

1174
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:39,843
Up. Okay.

1175
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,599
We're gonna be okay.

1176
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:47,935
I don't know.

1177
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:52,981
Katie!

1178
01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:55,108
Katie, get away from there!

1179
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:57,569
Kristi, listen to me,
stay right here, okay?

1180
01:25:57,654 --> 01:25:59,321
Don't move, okay?

1181
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:18,131
Katie?

1182
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:07,199
Come on, Toby.

1183
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:13,288
Let's get ready.
