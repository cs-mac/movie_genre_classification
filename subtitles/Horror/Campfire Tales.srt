1
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,053
Hey, all you lovebirds
out there...

2
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:36,112
Rockin' Rob's telling you
to listen to this one...

3
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:39,489
from inside home, sweet home.
No joke, kids.

4
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:41,926
Police are still searching
for Willie "The Hook" Peters...

5
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:44,954
who escaped yesterday from
Burke State Mental Hospital...

6
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:49,059
so stay safe and stay cool
with this next hot tune.

7
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:52,003
# Oh, well #

8
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:54,097
# I'm #

9
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,405
# Uhh, sittin' here, la la #

10
00:00:56,443 --> 00:00:59,606
# Waitin' for my ya ya, uh-huh #

11
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:01,443
#  Uh-huh #

12
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:03,210
#  A-sittin' here, la la #

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,515
#  Waitin' for my ya ya, uh-huh #

14
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:08,282
#  Uh-huh #

15
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:09,686
#  It may sound funny #

16
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:13,386
#  But I don't believe
she's comin', uh-huh #

17
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:15,690
#  Uh-huh #

18
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:17,890
#  Baby, hurry,
don't make me worry #

19
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:20,399
-I'm a virgin.
-You are?

20
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:22,060
#  Uh-huh #

21
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:23,933
#  Oh, yeah, baby, hurry #

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,201
#  Don't make me worry, uh-huh #

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,332
#  Uh-huh #

24
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,501
Stop.

25
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:30,669
#  You know that I love you #

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,975
#  Oh, how I love you, uh-huh #

27
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:35,811
#  Uh-huh #

28
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:37,714
#  A-sittin' here, la la #

29
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:41,346
#  Waitin' for my ya ya,
uh-huh, uh-huh #

30
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:42,685
What? What's the matter?

31
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:44,713
#  A-sittin' here, la la #

32
00:01:44,758 --> 00:01:46,783
Nothing, nothing.

33
00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:48,158
Nothing.

34
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,457
Nothing.

35
00:01:49,496 --> 00:01:50,895
Nothing.

36
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:54,833
#  But I don't believe
she's comin', uh-huh #

37
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:56,358
Just a second.
Let's take this off.

38
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:58,132
No. No.

39
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:00,537
Unzip this. Come on. Just do it.

40
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:02,166
No. No!

41
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,177
Don't. Don't.

42
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,406
What gives, Jenny?
I thought you liked me.

43
00:02:06,446 --> 00:02:09,711
Look, I thought
I saw someone out there.

44
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:10,909
#  It may sound funny #

45
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:12,816
Come on, Jenny,
I know you don't want to do it.

46
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:15,014
You don't have to make excuses
about it, though.

47
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:18,718
I'm serious, Eddie.
I saw someone.

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,158
What if it's that guy
with the hook hand?

49
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,362
OK.

50
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,394
All right,
well, forget about it.

51
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,703
They're not--
Nobody's lookin', all right?

52
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,175
Come on, don't worry about it.

53
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,973
#  Baby, hurry #

54
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:42,311
#  Don't make me worry, uh-huh #

55
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,442
Unh. Unh.

56
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:48,181
There! I saw someone.

57
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:51,122
Well, I don't see anything,
all right? Now, come on.

58
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:52,556
#  And, oh, how I love you #

59
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:53,923
There! There was a flash!

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,518
Look,
there's nobody out there, OK?

61
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:57,860
Eddie, listen,
I want to get out of here.

62
00:02:57,898 --> 00:02:59,263
OK, how about just, you know--

63
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:00,561
No, no, no.

64
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,660
-A handjob?
-What? No!

65
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:07,104
Get--No! You take me home!
Take me home!

66
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,471
What are you doing?

67
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:10,874
Eddie! Drive, Eddie! Go!

68
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:12,242
All right. Cool it, will ya?

69
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:15,077
I just want to go. Take me home!

70
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,911
-Go!
-Right!

71
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:23,612
#  Mama said
there'll be days like this #

72
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:26,421
#  There'll be days like this,
Mama said #

73
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,949
#  Mama said, Mama said #

74
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:30,622
#  Mama said
there'll be days like this #

75
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:31,790
#  There'll be days
like this... #

76
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:33,890
This doesn't look like my house.

77
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:35,959
Just one burger, all right?

78
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:37,492
Tch.

79
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:41,232
#  Everything was going fine #

80
00:03:41,274 --> 00:03:43,902
#  I met a little boy
named Billy Joe #

81
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:45,809
Chicks, man.

82
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:48,814
Eddie? Eddie?

83
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:50,975
-What?
-I'll have a milkshake.

84
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:53,781
#  There'll be days like this,
my mama said #

85
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,310
#  Mama said, mama said #

86
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:57,118
Oh, my God.

87
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,426
Why didn't the guy get
one of those fake hands?

88
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:11,437
God, man, I don't know.

89
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:13,268
They didn't have them
back then.

90
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,365
Like you know.

91
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:17,569
Slow down, baby.

92
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,340
It's under control, Lauren.
Relax.

93
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,711
We should've
stayed on the highway.

94
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:23,079
Ohh, we don't need no highway.

95
00:04:23,116 --> 00:04:25,744
We take the back ways, man.
This is the scenic route.

96
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:27,252
Would you get
your boyfriend in line?

97
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:29,016
Just chill out.
Enjoy the ride.

98
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,147
I shouldn't have come.

99
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,021
Whoo hoo! Ha ha ha!

100
00:04:32,058 --> 00:04:35,050
Man, this is the best car, man!

101
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:39,264
Well, would you drive like
a decent human being?

102
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:42,925
Cliff, watch it.

103
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:45,028
Watch. Watch, watch, watch,
watch, watch, watch.

104
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:47,665
Whoo hoo! Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

105
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:50,005
-Knock it off.
-It's not funny, Cliff.

106
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:51,840
Aw, come on, Lauren,
lighten up.

107
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:52,867
Come here.

108
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:55,142
Cut it out
and watch the road.

109
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:58,082
-Not in front of my brother.
-You guys are gross.

110
00:04:58,118 --> 00:05:00,313
Me? I'm not doing anything.

111
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,615
Would you get on
the right side of the road?

112
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:02,814
Come on, man!

113
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:05,620
Nobody else out here.
It's just us.

114
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:07,717
Cliff! Cliff, watch it!

115
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:24,869
-Are you sure you're OK?
-Yeah, I said I'm fine.

116
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,071
OK.

117
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:36,921
Oh, man. I'm sorry, you guys.

118
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:38,685
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

119
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,955
I know. I know.

120
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:43,622
Oh, God, you're bleeding.

121
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:51,794
Need a hand?

122
00:05:51,838 --> 00:05:53,135
Fuck off.

123
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:57,910
Well, obviously
she's feeling OK.

124
00:05:57,944 --> 00:06:01,107
Thank God
we didn't hit that car.

125
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:03,274
They came out of nowhere.

126
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:04,943
They came out of nowhere?

127
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:06,713
You were the one
that was all over the road.

128
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:14,026
Oh, my God.

129
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,187
I can't believe this.

130
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:20,165
Oh, my God,
my brother's gonna kill me, man.

131
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:26,064
Listen,
I'm really worried about Eric.

132
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:28,404
He looks really shaken up.

133
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:35,279
Hey, you OK?

134
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:37,078
-Yeah.
-Huh?

135
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:39,278
Want to help me
start these flares?

136
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,479
OK.

137
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,389
All right.

138
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:54,930
They didn't even stop.

139
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:57,163
Probably thought we were crazy.

140
00:06:58,438 --> 00:06:59,598
Uhh.

141
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:07,571
Let's just start walking.

142
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:09,605
-Where?
-You can start walking, OK?

143
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,947
I can't leave
my brother's car here.

144
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:14,818
If you had just stayed
on the highway like I said...

145
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:16,446
we wouldn't be here
freezing our asses off...

146
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:17,649
in the middle of nowhere.

147
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,624
Why do you have to be
such a pain in the ass?

148
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:21,149
Why do you have to be
such an idiot?

149
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:22,718
Fuck you.

150
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:25,060
Oh, God, would you guys
please stop it? Please?

151
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:27,157
Eric, where are you going?

152
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:32,102
-You guys, come look at this.
-Give me the flashlight.

153
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:44,549
Oh, my God.

154
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:46,484
Looks like
it must have been a church.

155
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,817
God, this place is creepy.

156
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,654
It's just a building, Alex.

157
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:00,360
Wow, this looks like
early nineteenth century.

158
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,130
I'd say...

159
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,467
1837.

160
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:09,198
How can you tell?

161
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,037
Well, it says it right there.

162
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:19,742
See, it's not that bad, man.

163
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:21,583
We're all OK, you know?

164
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:25,521
We saw a great concert.

165
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:26,684
Right?

166
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:28,216
It was pretty awesome.

167
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:30,195
There you go, buddy.

168
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,629
You wear that T-shirt
tomorrow to school...

169
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:32,961
you're gonna be the man.

170
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:35,695
Guys, maybe we should
go back up to the road.

171
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:38,761
That way, if a car comes,
then they can call for help.

172
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:41,672
Yeah, right before they kill us.

173
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,335
We're OK.

174
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:46,038
If a car comes, they're
gonna stop at the flares...

175
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,274
and we'll hear 'em.

176
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:50,179
You want to build a fire?

177
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:56,948
Nice.

178
00:08:58,324 --> 00:08:59,484
Ohh.

179
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,359
Don't burn the article
about the concert.

180
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,455
What's the matter?

181
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:11,961
Holy shit.

182
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:13,267
What?

183
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,972
Two people were hacked to death
around here.

184
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:19,672
Yeah, right.

185
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,275
Let me see that for a second.

186
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:27,813
Oh, this is sick.

187
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:29,014
What?

188
00:09:30,356 --> 00:09:32,221
"Police speculate
that the murder weapon...

189
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:35,625
was an ice pick
or possibly even a meat hook."

190
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:36,993
They say they have a suspect...

191
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,463
but they haven't made
an arrest yet.

192
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:43,398
That's pretty freaky shit.

193
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:46,065
Ohh.

194
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:51,639
Hey, you OK, Eric?

195
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:54,442
What? Yeah.

196
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,449
You're lookin' a little scared
over there.

197
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,345
No. I'm not scared at all.

198
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:07,092
Well, uh...

199
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:12,025
I think that's just 'cause...

200
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:14,192
you know,
you're with me right now.

201
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:17,933
If you were alone, I mean...

202
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,961
you'd be shitting in your pants.

203
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:24,500
I mean, you'd be...

204
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:27,104
seeing and hearing things...

205
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:30,047
that weren't even here,
you know?

206
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,415
You'd feel like
you were being watched.

207
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:41,423
Every sound would seem louder
than it really was, you know?

208
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,053
Dee!

209
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:45,724
You are such an asshole.
You're not gonna scare us.

210
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,963
Really?

211
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:55,004
You know,
if I did want to scare you...

212
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,032
I'd tell you
about Rick and Valerie.

213
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:59,738
-Cliff.
-You'd tell her about who?

214
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,804
He's asking.

215
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:03,110
Yeah, tell me.

216
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:08,011
Come on, tell me.

217
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:09,544
I'm not scared.

218
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,850
Go ahead.

219
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:16,384
All right.

220
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:21,197
Rick and Valerie were these
newlyweds from Long lsland.

221
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:26,171
They decided to honeymoon,
road-tripping to Vegas.

222
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:27,934
They were gonna stop
along the way...

223
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:29,669
and see all the sights.

224
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:33,008
So they rented this big ass RV,
and they were off.

225
00:11:33,546 --> 00:11:36,947
#  I have kissed your lips #

226
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,008
#  A thousand times #

227
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:42,020
#  And more times
than I can count #

228
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,045
#  I have called you mine #

229
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,526
#  You have stood by me #

230
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,222
#  In my darkest hour #

231
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:53,255
#  And, oh, how happy #

232
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:56,029
#  You have made me #

233
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,730
#  Oh, how happy #

234
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:00,068
#  You have made me #

235
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:01,164
Come on, everybody.

236
00:12:01,207 --> 00:12:04,005
#  Oh, how happy #

237
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,637
#  You have made me #

238
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,805
#  Oh... #

239
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:11,943
#  Oh, how happy
you have made me #

240
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:14,316
Ooh. I think
this is where we turn off.

241
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,651
Oh, I'm turned off already.

242
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:19,157
Do we have to go?

243
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:22,423
Valerie.
History took place here.

244
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:25,625
You know, we could never
be back this way again.

245
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:27,758
Promise?

246
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,360
Oh, now, that pains me.

247
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:37,400
You know, that's not a positive
way to start a marriage.

248
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:39,274
Besides, I want you
to look me in the eye...

249
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:42,145
and I want you to tell me that
you have absolutely no desire...

250
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:43,478
to see Clayton's Caverns.

251
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:44,915
Which eye?

252
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:48,478
Ha ha ha ha. Smart ass.

253
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:49,818
Either one.

254
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:55,920
I have absolutely no desire
to see Clayton's Caverns.

255
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:00,092
Whoo.

256
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:02,362
You know something?

257
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:03,993
I want you to read
page sixty-two.

258
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:05,162
I've read it already.

259
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:07,263
I want you to look
at page sixty-two.

260
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:08,739
I read it already.

261
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:10,867
For me?

262
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,073
1922, twelve pioneers
got trapped in the pass...

263
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:16,911
and only three survived
by eating the other nine.

264
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:20,179
Right. See?

265
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:22,983
Valerie, it's second only
to the Donner Party Trail.

266
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:25,923
-Oh, Ricky Ricks!
-What?

267
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,518
Well, it's dark outside already.

268
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:30,358
Besides, I don't know
what you think...

269
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:32,091
we're gonna see out there.

270
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:36,158
Dead bodies
strewn along the rocks?

271
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:38,227
Well, what would you rather do?

272
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:43,835
Mm-mm-mm.

273
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:46,840
Oh, you devil.

274
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,445
I don't know.

275
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:54,545
Oh, you are a bad girl.
You are so bad.

276
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:56,646
I'm gonna punish you, bad girl.

277
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,418
Oh! OK.

278
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,391
Promise?

279
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:23,007
Mmm.

280
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,914
Maybe next time
we'll make it to the bed.

281
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,509
Mmm.

282
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:28,850
I hope twenty years from now...

283
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:31,220
we'll still be knocking it out
on the floor.

284
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:33,122
Twenty years from now?

285
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,457
I hope
we're knocking it out anywhere.

286
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,962
I think
there's somebody out there.

287
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:51,676
Here. Put this on.

288
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:58,208
Aw, shit.

289
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,912
-You all right?
-I just twisted my ankle.

290
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:08,325
Stay here.

291
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:11,026
Can I help you?

292
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,198
Honey, wait inside.

293
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:23,401
No.

294
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,276
We have money.

295
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:34,617
I ain't after your money.

296
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:45,356
That's just a crow.

297
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:48,299
Crows don't squawk at night...

298
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:51,803
unless they're stirred.

299
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:01,913
You know where the highway's at?

300
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:05,507
Yeah. I go straight ahead...

301
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:08,452
I get to the lake,
and I make a left.

302
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,955
No, no. You make a right.

303
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,788
You'll hit the highway
in about four miles.

304
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:15,851
Thank you.

305
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:20,332
And don't stop for anything
till you get to the highway.

306
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,534
Now go...

307
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:26,965
and pray
they don't get you first.

308
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:29,372
-Who doesn't get us?
-Valerie.

309
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:34,004
When the moon's full...

310
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:36,014
they come out to hunt.

311
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,618
Now, you listen, boy.

312
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:44,948
A while back...

313
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,891
my wife's car
broke down out here.

314
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:52,155
We never found her.

315
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:54,692
Sorry.

316
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:57,428
Yeah.

317
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:03,138
They must have heard
my truck comin'.

318
00:17:04,543 --> 00:17:07,205
You're lucky
you still got your skin on.

319
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:10,047
What do you mean?

320
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:15,076
There's tracks circling
all around your vehicle.

321
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:18,950
Now, I wasn't the only one here.

322
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:23,819
Now go.

323
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:25,888
All right,
come on, baby, let's go.

324
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,866
And no matter what,
y'all stay inside.

325
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:33,599
If they stop you...

326
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:36,802
you lock your doors
and wait for sunup.

327
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:41,371
Ain't nobody ever seen them
in the day.

328
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:46,448
I guess we better--we better
get moving along, then.

329
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:50,019
Thank you.

330
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,216
How bizarre was that?

331
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:25,986
"When the moon is full,
they come out to hunt."

332
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:31,096
Thought that was the Wolfman.

333
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,032
He seemed so...concerned.

334
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:37,900
Valerie, he's a Peeping Tom.
All right?

335
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:40,667
Who knows how long he was
out there jangling his keys?

336
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:43,732
What about all those footprints?

337
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:45,539
The guy made 'em.

338
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:47,273
What about his wife
disappearing?

339
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,610
If I were that guy's wife,
I would disappear, too, right?

340
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,485
Oh, man, what now?

341
00:18:57,957 --> 00:19:00,255
-Aw, shit!
-What?

342
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:02,351
It can't be empty.
I just filled it up.

343
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:04,385
Well, maybe there's a leak.

344
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:11,664
Rick, he said to stay in here
no matter what.

345
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:14,571
Give me a break.

346
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:45,263
Oh, easy, Cole.

347
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:47,636
Easy. Easy.

348
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:57,606
I'll take you with me!

349
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:07,354
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want;,

350
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:08,985
"He maketh me lie down
in green pastures.

351
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:10,689
"He restoreth my soul.

352
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:13,254
"He leadeth me
in paths of righteousness...

353
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,926
"for His name's sake.

354
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:16,992
"Yea, though I walk
through the valley...

355
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,833
"of the shadow of death...

356
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:20,361
"l will fear no evil;

357
00:20:20,406 --> 00:20:23,341
for thou art with me."

358
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,053
God damn it!

359
00:20:42,995 --> 00:20:45,156
That son of a bitch
siphoned our tank.

360
00:20:45,197 --> 00:20:46,357
What?

361
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,962
No more.

362
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:57,006
Hear me?

363
00:21:16,695 --> 00:21:18,686
Aah! Aah! Aah!

364
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:24,128
Aah! Aah!

365
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:41,949
Oh, Jesus. We should
run out of gas more often.

366
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:44,478
#  I've learned #

367
00:21:44,523 --> 00:21:46,991
#  Love is a thrill #

368
00:21:47,026 --> 00:21:49,494
#  A little bit of lipstick #

369
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:51,553
#  A little bit of frill #

370
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:53,895
#  I know... #

371
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:59,836
Oh, God. You make me crazy.

372
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:05,839
#  Love at first sight #

373
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:08,244
#  Blows you all away #

374
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,373
#  Hold onto the wheel #

375
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,281
#  Love is here to stay #

376
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:14,877
#  Love grows large #

377
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,219
#  Blossoms like a flower #

378
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:20,748
#  To die in the night #

379
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:23,261
#  To be born again #

380
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:35,701
Whoo!

381
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:43,213
I just had great sex! Ha ha!

382
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:46,308
Get back in here!
What are you, crazy?

383
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:47,511
Whoo!

384
00:22:49,354 --> 00:22:51,948
-Crazy about you.
-Aah.

385
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,016
-What's the matter, baby?
-My ankle.

386
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,393
-You all right?
-Yeah. It's OK.

387
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,897
Come here, sit down.

388
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:04,802
Let me see that.

389
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,031
Valerie, that's really swollen.

390
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:13,607
No, it's OK, Ricky.

391
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:27,717
There's got to be a first-aid
kit in here somewhere.

392
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:36,095
Jesus. I could catch
a fuckin' marlin...

393
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:38,126
but God forbid we cut ourselves.

394
00:23:40,906 --> 00:23:42,066
Screw it.

395
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:45,836
I'm gonna go to that store
by the turnoff.

396
00:23:45,878 --> 00:23:48,210
-I saw a pump out front.
-But, Rick--

397
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:50,579
Honey,
I'm gonna fill up the can.

398
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:52,277
I'm gonna get you to a doctor.

399
00:23:52,317 --> 00:23:54,785
They got to be closed by now.

400
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:58,823
So I knock on the door.

401
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:01,451
I'm sure there's some hick
sleeping in the back.

402
00:24:01,493 --> 00:24:03,893
What if that guy's
still out there?

403
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:09,426
Valerie...

404
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:11,834
that guy is long gone by now.

405
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:17,431
I'm not gonna let you lie here
uncomfortable all night...

406
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:20,070
especially on your honeymoon.

407
00:24:21,647 --> 00:24:23,945
I'm gonna be back in an hour...

408
00:24:23,982 --> 00:24:25,677
and then
we're gonna get out of here.

409
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:31,681
All right?

410
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:32,883
OK?

411
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:40,123
OK, honey.

412
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:47,170
-Hurry.
-I will. Don't worry.

413
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:59,911
Look, uh, if it makes you feel
any better...

414
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:01,886
you can lock the door
after I leave, all right?

415
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,820
And we'll have
a secret code, OK?

416
00:25:03,855 --> 00:25:05,982
You don't open it until
you hear me go like this...

417
00:25:08,427 --> 00:25:10,292
OK?

418
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:12,422
-OK.
-All right.

419
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:15,995
Ricky Ricks?

420
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:19,594
Uh, can you bring me some M&M's?

421
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,107
-With peanuts?
-Mm-hmm.

422
00:25:24,142 --> 00:25:26,337
I'll see what I can do.

423
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,242
Thank you.

424
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:51,061
Sss.

425
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:54,368
I love you.

426
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:57,933
I love you, too.

427
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:25,336
Where the fuck
am I gonna find M&M's?

428
00:26:32,411 --> 00:26:34,879
God, I hate
having an imagination.

429
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:13,111
Hello?

430
00:27:19,624 --> 00:27:20,818
Mister?

431
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:25,457
You in there?

432
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,700
Mister?

433
00:27:49,654 --> 00:27:50,814
Mister?

434
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:55,590
Are you all right?

435
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:59,027
Aah! Son of a--

436
00:28:28,894 --> 00:28:30,054
Valerie!

437
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:33,528
Aah! Aah!

438
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:38,667
Aah!

439
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:02,689
#  Oh, how happy #

440
00:29:02,727 --> 00:29:05,423
#  You have made me #

441
00:29:05,464 --> 00:29:08,592
#  Oh, how happy #

442
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:10,225
#  You have made me #

443
00:29:10,268 --> 00:29:13,294
#  I have kissed your lips #

444
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,367
Valerie!

445
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:20,542
Valerie!

446
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,877
Valerie!

447
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,152
Valerie!

448
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:36,794
Valerie!

449
00:29:45,036 --> 00:29:47,527
#  Oh, how happy #

450
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:49,699
#  You have made me #

451
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:52,266
#  Our years together #

452
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,971
#  We have had-- #

453
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:01,712
Rick?

454
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:06,220
Rick, is that you?

455
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:11,155
Rick?

456
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:16,896
Jesus.

457
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,661
Rick, come on, this isn't funny.

458
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,100
Aah!

459
00:30:58,243 --> 00:31:00,768
Aah! Aah!

460
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:19,396
Aah!

461
00:31:19,431 --> 00:31:22,059
Aah!

462
00:32:34,773 --> 00:32:36,172
-Aah!
-Aah!

463
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:40,541
-Aah!
-Aah! Aah!

464
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,374
Aah!

465
00:33:24,723 --> 00:33:26,953
Get away from me!

466
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:34,455
Leave me alone!

467
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:37,730
Aah! Aah! Rick! Rick!

468
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,671
Rick!

469
00:33:47,712 --> 00:33:50,306
Rick! Rick!

470
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:29,214
Hello?

471
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:32,747
Is anyone in there?

472
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:39,755
This is Deputy Munson
from the sheriff's department.

473
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:42,390
Are they gone?

474
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:45,899
Yes, ma'am.

475
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,131
You alone in there?

476
00:34:52,744 --> 00:34:53,904
Yes.

477
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:05,955
Are you injured, miss?

478
00:35:08,426 --> 00:35:10,485
I think I'm OK.

479
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:15,633
Can you stand up
and come to the door?

480
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,740
Can you step down, please?

481
00:35:31,282 --> 00:35:33,113
Good.

482
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:35,016
Oh, my husband
just went to get gas.

483
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:36,281
He should be back any minute.

484
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:39,017
Ma'am,
we're gonna walk to my car now.

485
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:40,684
Oh, no.
I have to wait for my husband.

486
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:42,590
Why don't you come with me
to the car...

487
00:35:42,627 --> 00:35:45,960
and we can sort everything out
at the sheriff's station.

488
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:49,692
Please, let's just keep moving.

489
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:51,429
W-wait. Just--please.

490
00:35:52,637 --> 00:35:54,696
Keep your eyes straight ahead.

491
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:56,604
Keep walking to the car.

492
00:36:03,715 --> 00:36:06,980
Aah! Aah!

493
00:36:07,018 --> 00:36:09,452
Aah! Aah!

494
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:11,648
She screamed so loud...

495
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:14,317
that she drowned out the sound
of her husband's wedding ring...

496
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:16,327
scraping across the roof.

497
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:24,730
Ugh.

498
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,737
Well, I know one thing--

499
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:29,467
I'm not driving to Las Vegas
on my honeymoon.

500
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:33,677
I don't think you have to worry
about a honeymoon.

501
00:36:36,114 --> 00:36:38,878
That story's not true,
though, right?

502
00:36:38,917 --> 00:36:40,384
Nah, it is, man.
I know a couple of guys...

503
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:41,908
that lived in the town
it happened.

504
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,390
What's so funny?

505
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:49,416
I just remembered something.

506
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:51,656
What?

507
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:53,596
Do you remember
when Dad went to Las Vegas...

508
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:55,258
and I had
that really bad nosebleed?

509
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,767
No.

510
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:58,325
You were, like, I don't know,
five or six...

511
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:00,633
and it was really late.
You were sleeping...

512
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:01,798
and I was laying in Mom's bed...

513
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,272
and she just didn't know
what to do.

514
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,935
You know, she tried everything,
and nothing worked...

515
00:37:04,976 --> 00:37:06,273
so she called Grandma...

516
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:09,109
and I guess
we must have woken you up...

517
00:37:09,147 --> 00:37:11,377
because you were
standing in the doorway...

518
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:15,853
when the blood just started
pouring out of my nose.

519
00:37:16,888 --> 00:37:18,355
This is funny to you?

520
00:37:18,389 --> 00:37:19,651
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

521
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:22,717
So when mom saw it,
she dropped the phone...

522
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,751
and just fell backwards.
She fainted.

523
00:37:24,796 --> 00:37:27,060
And then
you went over to the phone...

524
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:30,625
and you said,
"Grandma, Mom's dead...

525
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:32,795
and Lauren's bleeding to death
in bed."

526
00:37:32,837 --> 00:37:34,828
And then you just
hung up the phone.

527
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:55,719
-Hey.
-Hey.

528
00:37:57,128 --> 00:37:58,789
It's all right, Lauren.

529
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,492
It's OK, Lauren.
We're gonna be all right.

530
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:06,562
It'll be like, um...
another funny story.

531
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:13,169
What the hell was that?

532
00:38:14,245 --> 00:38:15,405
What?

533
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:29,183
Cliff,
would you please not do this?

534
00:38:29,227 --> 00:38:32,253
Oh, you're not scared,
are you, Cliffy?

535
00:38:32,296 --> 00:38:35,265
You guys didn't hear that?

536
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:43,771
You think the flares
are still burning?

537
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,241
Yeah. We stacked them...

538
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:50,475
so they should burn
for, like, uh, a half hour.

539
00:38:51,516 --> 00:38:55,077
Oh, man. Fuck.

540
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,555
Aw, shit.
I forgot to feed Dante.

541
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:01,581
Don't worry about it. I filled
his bowl before we left.

542
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:03,526
He's fine.

543
00:39:03,561 --> 00:39:04,687
Really.

544
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:07,095
Yeah,
he's safe and sound at home.

545
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:10,225
Hey, that reminds me
of another story.

546
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:11,963
You guys want to hear it?

547
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:16,038
How about you, sweet cheeks?

548
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:24,380
All right, this is about a girl,
a little girl--Amanda.

549
00:39:24,415 --> 00:39:27,009
It was the day before
her twelfth birthday.

550
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:29,676
She couldn't wait to get home.

551
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,950
I don't care if you were joking.

552
00:40:08,993 --> 00:40:12,861
No, you embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

553
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:14,762
Well, maybe you should
have thought of that...

554
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:16,790
before you pissed me off.

555
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:20,100
Dad!

556
00:40:20,138 --> 00:40:21,605
In the kitchen.

557
00:40:24,408 --> 00:40:26,205
Did you get it?

558
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:29,811
Your birthday's tomorrow.

559
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:32,611
Oh, can't I please
have my bike tonight?

560
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:35,448
Bike. That would have been
a good idea.

561
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:36,817
Dad.

562
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:41,114
Hey, Odin. Come here, boy.

563
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,353
Is Mom home yet?

564
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:43,883
-Not yet.
-Come here.

565
00:40:43,928 --> 00:40:46,556
Oh, what a good puppy.

566
00:40:46,597 --> 00:40:48,155
Oh, come here, boy.

567
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:51,892
Uhh, uhh, yeah, uhh.

568
00:40:51,936 --> 00:40:55,963
Listen, thanks for sticking
around with Amanda, Katherine.

569
00:40:56,007 --> 00:40:58,066
You didn't wear that to school,
did you?

570
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:00,373
I did today.

571
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:02,379
-There she is.
-Sorry I'm late.

572
00:41:02,413 --> 00:41:03,539
-Hi.
-Hi, girls.

573
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:04,878
Mom, did Dad buy my bike?

574
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:07,111
Uh, Mandy, you're gonna
spoil your appetite.

575
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:08,743
Mom.

576
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:10,811
Sorry. Amanda, you're gonna
spoil your appetite.

577
00:41:10,855 --> 00:41:13,050
Katherine, you're wearing
that top we got. Looks cute.

578
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,284
-Uh, hi.
-I know, I know.

579
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:15,587
I'll be down in a minute.

580
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:17,457
-Better hurry.
-OK.

581
00:41:17,495 --> 00:41:20,487
Oh, you guys hungry?
What do you guys want to order?

582
00:41:20,531 --> 00:41:22,658
Uh, daddy, why don't you
just leave me the money...

583
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,668
and I can order us something?

584
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:25,964
Mm-hmm.

585
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:29,535
Here. Here.

586
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:32,509
Oh, I don't think
this is gonna be enough...

587
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:34,534
especially if we order Chinese.

588
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:37,571
You're like a sieve, Katherine.
Here's another ten.

589
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:44,916
Here's your split.

590
00:41:44,956 --> 00:41:48,585
I'm going out tonight.
Don't tell anybody, OK?

591
00:42:01,739 --> 00:42:03,832
#  I'm waiting #

592
00:42:03,874 --> 00:42:04,966
#  For something
to come through #

593
00:42:05,009 --> 00:42:07,603
Oh, come on.

594
00:42:07,645 --> 00:42:10,341
-Amanda.
-Come in.

595
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,278
Hi, Mom. You look awesome.

596
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:15,717
Oh, thanks, honey.

597
00:42:15,753 --> 00:42:17,311
So, is there anything
you want to warn me about...

598
00:42:17,355 --> 00:42:20,552
before I see your teachers
tonight?

599
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:24,755
Oh. Actually,
you know Mr. Blackman?

600
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,057
Mm-hmm.

601
00:42:26,097 --> 00:42:28,395
He caught me smoking
in the bathroom.

602
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:31,265
-What?
-I'm just kidding, mom.

603
00:42:31,302 --> 00:42:32,894
Oh.

604
00:42:32,937 --> 00:42:37,397
-I love you.
-Oh, I love you, too.

605
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:40,171
We're going out to dinner after,
so I'll see you in the morning.

606
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:43,305
-Don't work too hard.
-I won't.

607
00:42:43,347 --> 00:42:45,542
Oh, and, honey,
Odin's been digging again...

608
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,107
so if he goes back outside
tonight...

609
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:48,914
make sure you wipe off his paws
when he comes in.

610
00:42:48,953 --> 00:42:50,147
I will.

611
00:42:58,162 --> 00:43:00,357
#  No breathing #

612
00:43:00,398 --> 00:43:03,424
#  Your sweet melody #

613
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:06,832
#  No boy talk #

614
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:14,573
#  I'm waiting #

615
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:17,206
#  With nothin' to do #

616
00:43:18,616 --> 00:43:21,585
#  I'm waiting #

617
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:23,109
#  Just a-waiting on... #

618
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:13,262
OK, come on. Come on.

619
00:44:13,304 --> 00:44:15,602
Oh, you're so silly, dog.

620
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:20,605
Come on. Odin.

621
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:21,838
Amanda!

622
00:44:23,848 --> 00:44:25,110
What do you want?

623
00:44:25,149 --> 00:44:28,983
If you touch my blow-dryer
again, you're dead.

624
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:34,850
Dina and l
are going out tonight.

625
00:44:34,892 --> 00:44:37,486
If you tell Mom and Dad,
you're dead.

626
00:44:37,528 --> 00:44:38,722
If you go in my room--

627
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:41,197
Let me guess--I'm dead.

628
00:44:41,232 --> 00:44:43,496
Exactly.

629
00:44:49,407 --> 00:44:52,035
More. Oh, you're my big boy.

630
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:54,169
What are you lookin' at?

631
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:06,045
I can't wait
till my party tomorrow.

632
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:10,821
Yeah, we're gonna have
a D.J. and everything.

633
00:45:12,563 --> 00:45:14,656
Of course I invited Lisa.

634
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,028
All of the Lisas.

635
00:45:19,537 --> 00:45:22,404
Oh, damn it.
I'll call you back, OK?

636
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,777
You go in the bushes and get it.

637
00:45:28,279 --> 00:45:30,577
Flattery will get you nowhere.

638
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:06,142
I told you, I'm going out.

639
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,378
It's none of your business
where.

640
00:46:24,435 --> 00:46:25,732
Amanda!

641
00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:27,202
Out here!

642
00:46:33,677 --> 00:46:36,737
No. Amanda!

643
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,338
No.

644
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:40,441
We'll discuss this later.

645
00:46:40,484 --> 00:46:42,543
I told you, I'm going out.

646
00:46:42,586 --> 00:46:45,953
If I wanted to tell you where,
I would have.

647
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,618
Jesus, you stink.

648
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:51,355
No. No, I wasn't talking to you.

649
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:53,363
I've got to go now.
OK, good-bye.

650
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:56,594
Good-bye. I'm hanging up now.
Good-bye.

651
00:46:56,634 --> 00:46:58,329
I'll be back
before Mom and Dad get home.

652
00:46:58,369 --> 00:46:59,768
Remember what I said.

653
00:46:59,803 --> 00:47:01,566
I won't say anything.

654
00:47:01,605 --> 00:47:04,335
I'll see you when you're twelve.

655
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:06,866
I hope you get your bike.

656
00:47:16,353 --> 00:47:18,184
Are you digging again?

657
00:47:20,024 --> 00:47:21,719
Come on, Odie. Out.

658
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:41,901
So, this is
what you were digging up.

659
00:47:49,353 --> 00:47:51,947
It's just
a pair of old clippers.

660
00:48:14,511 --> 00:48:15,671
Come on, Odin.

661
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,378
Come on, Odin.

662
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,755
Stay. Come here. Come here.

663
00:48:30,194 --> 00:48:31,752
Oh, good boy.

664
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:34,962
Come on.

665
00:51:54,598 --> 00:51:55,758
Night, Odin.

666
00:51:56,733 --> 00:51:57,893
Odie.

667
00:52:45,616 --> 00:52:47,277
Odin?

668
00:52:55,225 --> 00:52:56,556
Odin?

669
00:54:48,672 --> 00:54:50,537
Odin?

670
00:54:51,742 --> 00:54:53,403
Are you in here?

671
00:54:54,945 --> 00:54:56,378
Odin?

672
00:55:34,618 --> 00:55:36,108
Yes!

673
00:55:39,322 --> 00:55:40,914
Aah!

674
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,229
Is that you, Odin?

675
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:25,059
Hey, I've been looking all over
for you. Everything OK?

676
00:56:25,102 --> 00:56:27,866
I was fine until
you scared the shit out of me!

677
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:30,269
Little brat.

678
00:56:32,676 --> 00:56:34,769
There you are.

679
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:37,507
Yeah, you better hide.

680
00:56:52,262 --> 00:56:54,457
I told you before.

681
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:56,591
Flattery will get you nowhere.

682
00:57:11,148 --> 00:57:13,742
Aah!

683
00:57:13,783 --> 00:57:16,843
Katherine! Call 911!
There's a man under my bed!

684
00:57:18,622 --> 00:57:20,453
You've got to be kidding me.

685
00:57:35,472 --> 00:57:38,032
And by the time
the cops got there...

686
00:57:38,074 --> 00:57:41,134
the guy
was out her window and gone.

687
00:57:41,178 --> 00:57:42,440
And they say
that they're still...

688
00:57:42,479 --> 00:57:44,140
surfing the net
looking for this guy.

689
00:57:44,181 --> 00:57:46,672
So, you ever get
in a chat room, Eric...

690
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:50,550
and "Jessica" comes on-line,
you get out quick.

691
00:57:50,587 --> 00:57:51,849
Oh, God.

692
00:57:54,357 --> 00:57:57,224
I gotta pee.
You want to come with me?

693
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,319
Yeah. Let's go.

694
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:02,024
Don't let the crows get you.

695
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:04,260
Ha ha.

696
00:58:10,774 --> 00:58:12,833
Why are you so hard on Cliff?

697
00:58:12,876 --> 00:58:14,138
I am not that hard on him.

698
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:15,405
Yeah, you are, Alex.

699
00:58:15,445 --> 00:58:17,504
Oh, can't you tell
he's just joking?

700
00:58:17,547 --> 00:58:19,412
God, Lauren, you're so clueless.

701
00:58:19,449 --> 00:58:21,417
What, two days ago,
you were whining about...

702
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:24,215
how he wouldn't meet you
at Tracy's party, and...

703
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:25,551
And what?

704
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:29,020
And it seems like
you don't have time anymore...

705
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:31,050
for anyone except Cliff.

706
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:32,755
You know, that's bullshit.

707
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:35,497
Wait.

708
00:58:37,567 --> 00:58:38,693
How about this weekend...

709
00:58:38,735 --> 00:58:40,532
just you and me
do something together?

710
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:42,561
No guys?

711
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:44,471
No guys.

712
00:58:44,507 --> 00:58:47,203
OK.

713
00:58:47,244 --> 00:58:49,235
And about Cliff?

714
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:51,975
I really wish you would
just give him a chance.

715
00:58:52,015 --> 00:58:54,984
You should see how sweet
and sensitive he can be.

716
00:58:55,018 --> 00:58:57,248
So, you got hair
on your balls yet?

717
00:58:58,588 --> 00:58:59,816
What?

718
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,487
You're so immature.

719
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:07,921
I guess that means no.

720
00:59:08,999 --> 00:59:10,626
Fuck you.

721
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:13,534
Look, it's no big deal,
you know, if you don't.

722
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:15,731
Thank you.

723
00:59:17,607 --> 00:59:19,006
Lauren, just go already.

724
00:59:19,042 --> 00:59:20,942
Ohh!

725
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:23,309
God, I hope
I don't get poison ivy.

726
00:59:35,692 --> 00:59:38,525
Ha ha ha!

727
00:59:38,561 --> 00:59:40,552
Hey, what was that?
What was that?

728
00:59:40,597 --> 00:59:41,791
What?

729
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:44,160
You didn't see that?

730
00:59:45,602 --> 00:59:46,762
Cut the shit, Cliff.
It's not funny anymore.

731
00:59:46,803 --> 00:59:47,929
No, man, come on.

732
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:50,371
Look, I think there's someone
out there with a flashlight.

733
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:59,440
Look, let's just--
let's get back to the fire.

734
01:00:05,622 --> 01:00:08,147
Oh, you guys are such assholes.

735
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:09,317
You guys
should have seen yourselves.

736
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,485
You looked pretty hilarious.

737
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,620
Nice cheeks, Alex.

738
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:18,527
Don't worry. You'll get yours...

739
01:00:18,568 --> 01:00:20,297
when you least expect it.

740
01:00:22,105 --> 01:00:23,663
OK.

741
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:25,698
Hey, Lauren, can I get
under the blanket with you guys?

742
01:00:25,742 --> 01:00:27,141
'Cause I'm pretty cold.

743
01:00:27,177 --> 01:00:30,044
Yeah, come on. Come on.

744
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,411
Ooh!

745
01:00:32,849 --> 01:00:35,841
Gosh, we've got to keep
our minds off the cold.

746
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:38,911
Cliff, why don't you tell us
another one of your stories?

747
01:00:38,955 --> 01:00:40,752
Ooh, I got a great one for you.

748
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,190
All right, OK.

749
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:45,387
It's about this guy...

750
01:00:45,428 --> 01:00:48,397
and he's cruising cross-country
on his motorcycle.

751
01:00:48,431 --> 01:00:52,595
Thing was, he didn't know
what he was looking for.

752
01:00:52,635 --> 01:00:55,502
But he knew he was getting
closer with every mile.

753
01:01:02,278 --> 01:01:05,975
#  Old man Jack was sitting
on a stump beside the fire #

754
01:01:06,015 --> 01:01:09,007
#  Got real curious, he put
his hand inside the fire #

755
01:01:09,052 --> 01:01:11,577
#  He was seeing things,
flashes of light #

756
01:01:11,621 --> 01:01:13,521
#  Faces from his past #

757
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:15,922
#  Swallowed by the first friends
he followed #

758
01:01:15,959 --> 01:01:18,120
#  To the stars #

759
01:01:19,996 --> 01:01:22,829
#  Stars are the circuits
on the switchboard #

760
01:01:22,866 --> 01:01:24,458
#  Called the night #

761
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:26,935
#  Welcome to the mystery
that starts another life #

762
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:28,938
#  He was trembling and amazed #

763
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:30,997
#  When his feet
first left the ground #

764
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,032
#  Broke the break of day
and watched Jack walk #

765
01:01:34,077 --> 01:01:35,544
#  Without a sound #

766
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,345
Shit.

767
01:02:34,237 --> 01:02:35,932
Fuck. Terrific.

768
01:02:54,023 --> 01:02:56,617
Hello? Is there anyone home?

769
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:12,036
Hello?

770
01:03:17,981 --> 01:03:20,472
Look, I was just wondering
if I could use your phone.

771
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:27,553
Thank God.

772
01:03:33,096 --> 01:03:35,189
Hi. Hi.

773
01:03:40,937 --> 01:03:45,340
I'm riding my bike
cross-country, and, uh...

774
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:47,570
it gave out on me, and...

775
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,135
I left it down near the road.

776
01:03:56,152 --> 01:04:00,919
Oh, it's just my saddlebag.
Just some essentials.

777
01:04:00,957 --> 01:04:03,221
No weapons
or anything sharp or...

778
01:04:06,729 --> 01:04:08,492
Thanks.

779
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:11,261
This is really nice of you,
letting me in like this and all.

780
01:04:11,301 --> 01:04:12,928
Me being a stranger.

781
01:04:14,437 --> 01:04:16,701
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

782
01:04:19,042 --> 01:04:20,509
Thank you.

783
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:25,309
Do you have a phone I could use?

784
01:04:25,348 --> 01:04:27,373
I have a calling card.

785
01:04:28,918 --> 01:04:30,385
No. Well, I guess
you don't have to choose...

786
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:32,752
between MCl and AT&T then, huh?

787
01:04:36,693 --> 01:04:39,992
Uh...cat got your tongue?

788
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:44,398
You can't speak.

789
01:04:49,505 --> 01:04:52,133
Uh...I'm sorry.

790
01:04:52,175 --> 01:04:54,268
I didn't realize, and, uh...

791
01:05:15,698 --> 01:05:18,223
By the way, my name's Scott.

792
01:05:18,267 --> 01:05:20,098
Scott Anderson.

793
01:05:36,786 --> 01:05:39,550
"Heather Wallace."

794
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:42,422
You got a beautiful smile,
Heather Wallace.

795
01:05:43,493 --> 01:05:47,224
Well, thank you. It's fluoride.

796
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:15,888
So, do you, uh...

797
01:06:15,925 --> 01:06:17,859
do you live here
with your parents?

798
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:22,754
Just one.

799
01:06:24,634 --> 01:06:26,602
Is it your mother?

800
01:06:28,604 --> 01:06:30,504
It's your father.

801
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:34,067
Um, is he around?

802
01:06:43,553 --> 01:06:45,544
He's...dancing?

803
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:50,754
Um, he's--OK, he's not dancing.

804
01:06:50,793 --> 01:06:54,024
Let's see. He's--he's rowing.

805
01:06:54,063 --> 01:06:58,830
No. He's--he's boxing.
He's not a boxer, is he?

806
01:06:58,868 --> 01:07:03,202
Uh, he's--he's horseback riding.

807
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:04,934
He's horseback riding.

808
01:07:04,974 --> 01:07:06,965
All right. In the rain.

809
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:25,488
"Driving the herd."
He's a real cowboy.

810
01:07:28,431 --> 01:07:32,128
Now, would that be
a local herd...

811
01:07:32,168 --> 01:07:35,399
or would that be a faraway herd?

812
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:41,475
Faraway herd.

813
01:07:46,415 --> 01:07:48,679
I like your necklace.
It's beautiful.

814
01:07:59,395 --> 01:08:01,693
Is there anything
I can help you with?

815
01:08:11,207 --> 01:08:12,367
Water.

816
01:08:14,277 --> 01:08:16,370
From the well, right?

817
01:09:12,535 --> 01:09:15,766
I just--I felt trapped...

818
01:09:15,938 --> 01:09:20,398
so I figured I'd just
hop on my bike and, like, ride.

819
01:09:20,443 --> 01:09:23,640
You know, I think everyone
at least once in their life...

820
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,079
should know what it's like
to be completely free.

821
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:36,390
Looks like it's not going
to stop for a while.

822
01:10:16,866 --> 01:10:18,629
Shit.

823
01:10:45,061 --> 01:10:47,962
Oh, I didn't mean
to startle you.

824
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:50,693
That music
just sounded so familiar.

825
01:10:50,733 --> 01:10:52,530
I'm sorry. Good night.

826
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:02,943
Hey.

827
01:11:03,946 --> 01:11:07,074
Look, l, uh,
feel really silly...

828
01:11:07,116 --> 01:11:09,584
and I don't want you
to think that...

829
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:18,683
This whole thing,
it's like a dream.

830
01:11:18,728 --> 01:11:20,923
The storm, finding you here...

831
01:11:20,963 --> 01:11:23,523
it's like it was all supposed
to happen or something.

832
01:12:00,736 --> 01:12:02,363
What?

833
01:12:04,807 --> 01:12:06,934
Hey...

834
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:08,443
what did I do?

835
01:12:12,615 --> 01:12:15,516
I'm sorry. Like, we can--
we can just lie here...

836
01:12:15,551 --> 01:12:17,451
if it'll make you
more comfortable.

837
01:12:57,159 --> 01:13:00,720
You lie to me like a whore,
I'll treat you like a whore!

838
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:05,299
No, Papa, don't!

839
01:13:08,604 --> 01:13:11,004
Oh, God, what have I done?

840
01:13:19,982 --> 01:13:21,449
Oh, you scared
the crap out of me.

841
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:23,452
What the hell's going on
down there?

842
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:28,516
I saw someone outside.

843
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,025
What is it?

844
01:13:47,076 --> 01:13:50,170
Ghosts? You gotta be kidding me.

845
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:54,178
This happened here before.

846
01:13:55,818 --> 01:13:58,013
Why do you stay here?
You can leave, you know.

847
01:13:58,053 --> 01:13:59,179
You can come with me, Heather.

848
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:01,985
I'm not sure where I'm going,
but we can leave together.

849
01:14:06,195 --> 01:14:08,891
Now grab some stuff
and let's get out of here.

850
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:25,673
-You goddamn tramp!
-Heather?

851
01:14:25,714 --> 01:14:28,046
Get down here! Now!

852
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,574
What the hell
are you doing in my house?

853
01:14:30,619 --> 01:14:33,349
Papa, we didn't do anything!

854
01:14:33,389 --> 01:14:36,552
You lie to me like a whore,
I'll treat you like a whore!

855
01:14:40,162 --> 01:14:41,720
Heather!

856
01:14:42,932 --> 01:14:45,127
Aaaahh!

857
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:46,191
Papa!

858
01:15:01,617 --> 01:15:03,346
God, what have I done?

859
01:15:15,598 --> 01:15:18,192
Oh, my God, Heather!

860
01:15:18,234 --> 01:15:20,600
I thought he--you're all right.

861
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:25,464
You don't want to go in there!

862
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,646
No shit.

863
01:15:39,688 --> 01:15:43,715
Goddamn tramp!
Get down here! Now!

864
01:15:43,759 --> 01:15:46,887
Don't move from this spot.
Please.

865
01:15:51,133 --> 01:15:52,259
Oh, Christ.

866
01:15:52,301 --> 01:15:54,929
What the hell
are you doing in my house?

867
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:57,097
Look, I don't know
who you are or what you are.

868
01:15:57,139 --> 01:16:00,165
You ruined my daughter,
you son of a bitch.

869
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,705
It's not what you think!

870
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:09,349
Yaah!

871
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:21,528
Aah!

872
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:24,859
Come on, let's go!

873
01:16:30,272 --> 01:16:31,364
Let's just get out of here!

874
01:16:35,611 --> 01:16:37,579
No, Papa, don't!

875
01:16:45,154 --> 01:16:46,451
Shit.

876
01:16:57,666 --> 01:17:02,035
Goddamn tramp!
Get down here! Now!

877
01:17:43,312 --> 01:17:45,644
What's happening to me?

878
01:17:52,421 --> 01:17:55,254
No! No! No! No!

879
01:17:59,495 --> 01:18:01,463
And he just sat there...

880
01:18:01,497 --> 01:18:05,524
staring at her head in his lap.

881
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:08,400
The rest of her body
is just slumped on the grass.

882
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:11,638
So, she was a ghost all along?

883
01:18:11,673 --> 01:18:14,972
Yeah, but neither of them
knew it till the end.

884
01:18:17,346 --> 01:18:18,472
Not bad, huh?

885
01:18:18,514 --> 01:18:20,141
No. Not bad at all.

886
01:18:23,152 --> 01:18:25,950
What's wrong?

887
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:30,053
Hey, the police are here.

888
01:18:30,092 --> 01:18:32,925
Whoo hoo! Ha ha ha!

889
01:18:32,961 --> 01:18:34,360
Whoo hoo hoo!

890
01:18:38,267 --> 01:18:39,495
Hey, guys!

891
01:18:47,242 --> 01:18:48,607
Lauren!

892
01:19:00,556 --> 01:19:02,615
Ha.

893
01:19:02,658 --> 01:19:04,387
OK, guys.

894
01:19:14,736 --> 01:19:15,964
We have alcohol on the breath...

895
01:19:16,004 --> 01:19:18,768
head trauma, and
possible myocardial contusion.

896
01:19:18,807 --> 01:19:21,571
We gotta get him to the hospital
right now.

897
01:19:35,457 --> 01:19:38,085
I need to fly a medevac in
right away.

898
01:19:38,126 --> 01:19:39,457
They came out of nowhere.

899
01:19:39,495 --> 01:19:40,985
They were just weaving
all over the road.

900
01:19:41,029 --> 01:19:43,327
I have to swerve
to get out of the guy's way...

901
01:19:43,365 --> 01:19:45,731
and then he just veers
right off the road.

902
01:19:45,767 --> 01:19:49,498
Hey, can you not do that?

903
01:19:59,882 --> 01:20:03,045
Hey, sarge...
I got open containers.

904
01:20:03,085 --> 01:20:04,245
Great.

905
01:20:05,921 --> 01:20:08,389
We got V-tach.
Charge the paddles.

906
01:20:16,031 --> 01:20:17,555
Charging two hundred.

907
01:20:17,599 --> 01:20:19,760
Two hundred. Clear!

908
01:20:21,503 --> 01:20:23,403
Still V-tach.
Charging three hundred.

909
01:20:23,438 --> 01:20:25,133
Three hundred. Clear!

910
01:21:02,678 --> 01:21:04,475
I'm sorry.

911
01:21:15,424 --> 01:21:16,857
Charging three sixty.

912
01:21:16,892 --> 01:21:18,052
Three sixty.

913
01:21:19,061 --> 01:21:20,358
Clear!

914
01:21:22,898 --> 01:21:24,559
We have flatline.

915
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:29,131
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

916
01:21:29,171 --> 01:21:30,399
He's gone.

917
01:21:45,187 --> 01:21:48,714
Call in the code.
Time of death is 1 :21 a.m.

918
01:22:47,716 --> 01:22:49,308
Back up!

919
01:22:51,219 --> 01:22:53,084
Fuckin' moron.
