00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:37,508
<i>No!</i>

2
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:38,926
<i>No!</i>

3
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:42,080
<i>Please, let me go, Jimmy!</i>

4
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:44,549
<i>You're not going anywhere. You're
staying here with me, ain't ya?!</i>

5
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,651
<i>Get back here!</i>

6
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:47,419
<i>Damn it, I said get back in here!</i>

7
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:50,474
<i>- You're very high.
- Oh, I'm high?</i>

8
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:52,074
<i>- You're scaring me.
- Oh, really?</i>

9
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:55,677
<i>Please, I'll take Dale, and
we'll stay at my mom's.</i>

10
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:57,295
<i>We'll let you sleep it off!</i>

11
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,714
<i>No, you're not. You're not going anywhere, bitch!</i>

12
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:02,384
<i>You always run away, you're
always runnin' somewhere.</i>

13
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:03,752
I know it's worse this time.

14
00:01:22,388 --> 00:01:24,722
You wanna go watch?

15
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:30,796
Suit yourself.

16
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:39,371
Stay here.

17
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:47,896
<i>...That little freak? That little piece of shit?!</i>

18
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:50,365
<i>I ain't even certain he's mine! Is he?</i>

19
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:52,968
<i>Is-is that little fucking freak mine?!</i>

20
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:56,104
<i>Did you fuck around on me?!</i>

21
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:00,475
<i>Who you been fucking around with?</i>

22
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:18,026
<i>You're hurting me!</i>

23
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,587
Help me.

24
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:29,955
<i>Come here.</i>

25
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:47,122
Put-put the knife down!

26
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:49,207
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the fucking ground!

27
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:51,676
- Drop the knife!
- Drop the knife!

28
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:53,795
Get on the ground!

29
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:55,030
Get on the ground!

30
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:57,432
- Get on the ground!
- Freeze!

31
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:58,934
Go, go, go!

32
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:00,152
Go!

33
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:03,755
Hey, kid, what's your name?

34
00:03:03,856 --> 00:03:06,523
- Dale.
- Dale, you OK? Is your mom inside?

35
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,326
Stay here.

36
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:14,366
<i>Reno PD, entering premises.</i>

37
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,463
Police, coming in.

38
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:43,911
Stay there.

39
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:47,814
This is unit 610. Code 999.
Shots fired, requesting backup.

40
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,906
Did you hear that bang, mama?

41
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:14,076
I think they got him.

42
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:17,079
It's gonna be alright now.

43
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:21,649
Mama?

44
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,555
Shit.

45
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,801
Well, this is a disaster.

46
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:05,370
What are you doing up? I was
gonna make you breakfast in bed.

47
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:07,438
Well, you've gotta get it on the plate first.

48
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,074
Ha-ha-ha.

49
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:13,378
Besides, I haven't quite worked
up an appetite yet, anyway.

50
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,347
Um, well, what about pancakes?

51
00:06:16,448 --> 00:06:18,884
You can lick butter and syrup off me.

52
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:20,418
- Oh...
- I like it.

53
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,956
Um, did you notice, uh, someone new
just moved in across the street?

54
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:28,292
Really? That's what you're
thinking about right now?

55
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:31,229
Yeah, thought we could go introduce
ourselves before I go to work.

56
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,264
OK.

57
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:35,533
What?

58
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:36,902
Nothing.

59
00:06:37,303 --> 00:06:39,637
I just-I don't have time right now.

60
00:06:39,638 --> 00:06:42,473
Oh, but you have time to meet the new neighbor.

61
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:44,574
- Sarah...
- Look, it's fine.

62
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:46,577
It's fine. I'll be down in a sec.

63
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:48,213
- OK.
- OK.

64
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:01,475
<i>He's home, right?</i>

65
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:06,397
<i>I think that's his car in the driveway.</i>

66
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:22,579
Hi, uh, we live across the street. Thought
we'd come and introduce ourselves.

67
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,233
I'm Josh... and, uh, this is my wife, Sarah.

68
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,401
Hi.

69
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:29,988
Dale.

70
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,739
Dale.

71
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,575
Are these for me?

72
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:36,144
Yeah, welcome to the hood.

73
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:37,762
Did you make them?

74
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:40,181
No, I'd be lying if I said I did.

75
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,768
So you didn't make them?

76
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:46,204
No, they're from a packet.

77
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:51,025
It's the thought that counts.

78
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:54,996
Great house you got here.

79
00:07:55,097 --> 00:07:58,099
Probably... rented it for a steal, huh?

80
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,535
With the, uh, economy and... and all.

81
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:05,807
Is everything OK?

82
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:07,491
Sorry.

83
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:10,578
It's just that you-you remind me of someone.

84
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,150
So, what is it that you do, Josh?

85
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:18,586
Croupier over on the... I work on the strip.

86
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,923
Yeah, no, Sarah's the brains
in, uh, this relationship.

87
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:25,675
Yeah. She's, uh, just finished grad school
and is working on her dissertation,

88
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:29,931
the, uh, Sociological Effects of Internet
Pornography on Modern Relationships.

89
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:31,449
Or, something like that.

90
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,635
Yeah, she's, uh, going for her doctorate in social
science and already has an offer from UNLV.

91
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:40,224
You know what, Josh? Maybe we should
let Dale go, don't you think?

92
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:41,375
Right, of course.

93
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:43,528
Sorry, listen to me. Umm...

94
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,597
Anyway, great to meet you, Dale,
and, uh, we'll... see you around.

95
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:50,584
Nice to meet you.

96
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:09,120
<i>Oh, my God, Leslie.</i>

97
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:11,956
I can feel him kicking.

98
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,258
How do you know it's a him?

99
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,411
Oh, no girl could be that cruel.

100
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,100
I know what you're thinking, smart ass.

101
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:25,270
I didn't say anything.

102
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:29,438
OK, wait, so... what was it, again? You've
slept with two guys since your divorce?

103
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:33,792
One was black, one was Korean, so when this one
comes out, it won't take a genius to do the math.

104
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:35,246
Right, right.

105
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:40,314
Black, Korean, it is all extremes with you. One
was probably too big, one was probably too small.

106
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:44,272
Yeah! No shit! That Korean
was hung like an elephant.

107
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,835
He'll come around. You'll see.

108
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:59,370
I know, I just...

109
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:02,723
I don't know, I want him to
be ready, too, you know?

110
00:10:04,126 --> 00:10:05,259
Oh, my God.

111
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,427
Buster!

112
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:07,629
Buster, come here!

113
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,847
That scares the shit out of me every time.

114
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:13,133
Best watch dog a girl could
ever have, aren't you, buddy?

115
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:16,218
- Do you want some more tea?
- No, I should get this one home.

116
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:18,239
Right, and yeah, I should get some work done.

117
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,991
But it's Sunday, a day of rest.

118
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:23,411
Mmm, I'll rest when I'm dead.

119
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,293
Hi, Sarah.

120
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:41,712
It's, uh, Dale.

121
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,132
Oh, of course, Dale. I'm sorry.

122
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:47,418
I'm a little out of it today.

123
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,970
So, how long have you been working here?

124
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,941
Um, I just transferred from the other Super A.

125
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:56,660
72.80.

126
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:03,067
Let me help you out to your car.

127
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,052
Dale, this really isn't necessary.

128
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,921
Oh, that's your car, right?

129
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:09,557
Yeah.

130
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,559
Oh, here, let me get it for you.

131
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,294
Thank you.

132
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:21,536
This is really nice of you.

133
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:27,308
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Please.

134
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:29,711
- I'm your neighbor, not a stranger.
- Just take it.

135
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:30,811
No, no, no.

136
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:33,380
I'm your neighbor, not a stranger.

137
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:35,950
OK, thank you.

138
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:42,223
- Shoot.
- Oh, Dale?

139
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:44,992
I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.

140
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,561
Thank you. Bye.

141
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,939
- And river...
- Whoo-hoo.

142
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:00,441
She's a winner.

143
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:01,592
Sorry, sucker.

144
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:03,577
You're on a roll.

145
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:05,263
You're my lucky charm.

146
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:06,965
Thank you.

147
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,550
And that's my cue.

148
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:11,469
Uh-oh. Can I buy you a drink?

149
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,821
Uh, it's a casino, Helen. Drinks are free.

150
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:15,590
So am I.

151
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:18,509
Bye, Helen. All yours.

152
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:26,017
What's that, your retirement fund?

153
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:29,487
Yeah, fucking day shift.
Welfare checks only, please.

154
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:32,223
I know, man. Hey, you wanna grab lunch?

155
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:34,208
I got the, uh, I got the good stuff.

156
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:36,660
C'mon, Johnny, you know I
can't do that shit anymore.

157
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:40,114
Besides, I, um, I got another
one of those appointments.

158
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:42,683
Wow. Wow, OK.

159
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:44,986
Well, you're a determined son
of a bitch, I'll give you that.

160
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:48,003
- Shot for luck?
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, come on.

161
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:49,390
On the house.

162
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:51,476
Thank you.

163
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:10,010
<i>You do wanna have a baby with me, don't you?</i>

164
00:13:10,111 --> 00:13:13,531
I mean, starting a family, it's a big deal.

165
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:18,819
I-I guess I just need a little more time.

166
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,138
It's-it's only been, like,
the last couple of months

167
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,676
since your accident that we've...
even talked about it.

168
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,281
<i>I got a second shot, babe.</i>

169
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:32,817
I don't wanna waste any more time.

170
00:13:32,918 --> 00:13:36,003
I want to make every moment count.

171
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:39,907
So, let's go skydiving.

172
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:24,234
Hello?

173
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:25,770
<i>Hey, babe, it's me.</i>

174
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:26,937
Shouldn't you be home?

175
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:28,105
I know, I'm sorry,

176
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:29,223
I haven't been able to call 'til now.

177
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:32,658
Um, I am gonna rest up here for a
couple of hours and take another shift.

178
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:34,261
Really?

179
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:36,197
Yeah, I mean, I wanna take
as many as I can right now.

180
00:14:36,298 --> 00:14:37,565
You know...

181
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,367
<i>Night shifts mean bigger tips. I get it.</i>

182
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:42,669
I mean, I don't like it, but I get it.

183
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,839
Look, as soon as I'm finished with this God damn
thesis, I will start contributing again, I swear.

184
00:14:47,859 --> 00:14:50,728
No, it's... it's not that. I mean...

185
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:53,998
I think it's time we started
to save for the future.

186
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:57,935
<i>I mean, who knows what that may bring, right?</i>

187
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:02,788
Uh, yeah. OK, listen, hon, I gotta go. Umm...
You sure you're alright with this?

188
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:04,976
Yeah, no, I'm fine, of course.

189
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:07,026
<i>- Go.
- OK, I'll see you in the morning.</i>

190
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:08,513
Love you.

191
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:35,321
<i>- There you are.
- Hello.</i>

192
00:15:35,324 --> 00:15:36,674
<i>I'm glad you made it. How you doin'?</i>

193
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,392
<i>- Good, how are you?
- I'm good.</i>

194
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:41,829
<i>Look at you. You are just gorgeous.</i>

195
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,432
<i>And when I saw you in that club the other day,</i>

196
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:47,468
<i>I just had-I just had to have you...</i>

197
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,859
<i>Great ass...</i>

198
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:10,074
Dale, what a pleasant surprise.

199
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:11,976
Really?

200
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:14,695
How can I help you?

201
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:19,500
Ta-da! All gone.

202
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:21,351
The cookies.

203
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:22,986
They were delicious.

204
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:24,572
I'm glad you enjoyed them.

205
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:27,842
Well, at first, I was a little
upset because they're not homemade...

206
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,344
because homemade's better, right?

207
00:16:30,445 --> 00:16:36,533
But then I took my first bite, and
I... I didn't stop until I finished.

208
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:39,419
Well, I better get back...

209
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:45,493
Right.

210
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:48,112
You have things to do.

211
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:52,650
- Good night.
- Oh, just, uh, one more thing?

212
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:55,686
Wh-what was the brand, again?

213
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,622
Uh...of the cookies?

214
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:01,709
Um... Rainbridge Farm.

215
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,828
Right, Rainbridge Farm.

216
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:06,797
I'm gonna pick some of those up at work tomorrow.

217
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:10,017
OK. Good night, Dale.

218
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:30,588
To the extent that the consumption
of Internet pornography

219
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:33,541
is a factor subverting family life,

220
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:37,462
it harms not only those affected
immediately by the user,

221
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:40,247
but also by the wider society,

222
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:45,085
as well, as empirical research
testifies, to the relationship

223
00:17:45,186 --> 00:17:54,895
between family stability and the desirable
individual and social outcomes.

224
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:58,709
It was awful.

225
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,778
I mean, I woke up hyperventilating, disoriented.

226
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:05,449
My heart was racing like a million miles a minute.

227
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:08,719
Pavor nocturnus.

228
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,721
Excuse me?

229
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:13,391
Night terrors.

230
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:16,510
They're most common with kids,
but not uncommon with adults,

231
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:20,798
especially those experiencing stress
or a recent traumatic episode.

232
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,719
I'd say you fit into both
categories, don't you think?

233
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,991
Look, they're not dangerous, but
what you do during them can be.

234
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:32,793
Using kitchen appliances, walking into things.

235
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:35,412
I mean, people have been known to
jump out of windows in their sleep.

236
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:39,066
Wow, I guess I should feel lucky
all I did was change my top.

237
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:44,905
I remember... a while back, I was
experiencing something similar.

238
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,124
Waking at odd hours,

239
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:50,894
panicking with this strange feeling.

240
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:53,864
Anyway, my therapist thought it probably
had something to do with my divorce.

241
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:57,568
I was feeling unsafe, unprotected.

242
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:00,287
That is why I adopted Buster.

243
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,039
And?

244
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,775
He must've been right. I've felt fine ever since.

245
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:07,494
Are you saying that's how I feel?

246
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:10,097
Unprotected?

247
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:15,869
I'm saying you want something
Josh may not wanna give you.

248
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,556
And your subconscious may be reacting to that.

249
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:24,528
This should relax you.

250
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:26,080
One before bed.

251
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,915
Thank you.

252
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:36,517
Oh, Jesus, babe.

253
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:38,669
Babe, you scared me.

254
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:43,440
You alright?

255
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:48,513
I don't know.

256
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:56,270
There. Better?

257
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:57,437
Thank you.

258
00:21:57,438 --> 00:21:59,757
So, you saw Leslie about these things?

259
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,925
These, um... what did you call them?

260
00:22:01,993 --> 00:22:05,262
- Night terrors.
- Ooh, sounds ominous.

261
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:07,114
She said they're not dangerous,

262
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:11,369
but it's what you can do to yourself
while you're asleep that can be.

263
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,287
Like spilling wine on your clothes and
taking them off? Yeah, pretty lethal.

264
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,307
I don't think it was wine, Josh.

265
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:21,410
OK, OK, I'm sorry. Umm... What else?

266
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:26,183
When I woke up... I smelled cleaning products.

267
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:31,187
- OK, well, um, I'm gonna call in sick tonight.
- No, you don't have to do that.

268
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:33,090
I know I don't have to do it. I want to.

269
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:39,413
Who is it?

270
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:40,848
Uhh... work.

271
00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:47,818
So, uh, I'm gonna tell them that I'm not
coming in tonight, and you just relax.

272
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:02,019
Hello?

273
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,422
Yes, speaking.

274
00:23:05,023 --> 00:23:09,025
Oh! Oh, you-you have the results already.
Yeah, that was-that was quick.

275
00:23:09,227 --> 00:23:12,529
Uh, no. No, now's a-now's a good time.

276
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:23,624
Uh-huh.

277
00:23:29,296 --> 00:23:31,498
So, so that's it, then.

278
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:37,203
No, thank you.

279
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:53,170
You OK?

280
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:55,605
Yeah, I'm just tired is all.

281
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:57,590
Uhh, tell me about it.

282
00:23:57,691 --> 00:24:00,227
So, why don't you stop work and join me?

283
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:02,495
Mmm, give me a half hour.

284
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:04,965
I'm kind of on a roll at the moment.

285
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:07,601
Alright, see you soon.

286

Oh, Jesus.

302
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:05,161
What time is it?

303
00:27:05,262 --> 00:27:10,150
What's going... what's going on?

304
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:11,518
What is going on?

305
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:13,703

What, honey?

309

Honey?

310
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:25,764
Honey, honey, it's OK, it's OK. It's fine, OK?

311
00:27:25,884 --> 00:27:27,000
- It's fine.
- I think I...

312
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:29,452
I remember th... I thought I...

313
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:32,172
- Didn't I have... I remember...
- What?

314
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:35,859
- God, I can't fucking remember!
- Hey, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah!

315
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,027
You're really freaking me out now, OK?
Just... please, just calm down.

316
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:41,530
Calm down, calm down. Looks like nothing miss...

317
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:44,468
Come on, OK?

318
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:48,305
What happened?

319
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:50,473
How did my phone get cracked?

320
00:27:50,574 --> 00:27:51,875
What is happening?!

321
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:53,177
There's nothing...

322
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:55,778
- What's happening?!
- there's nothing wrong, OK? It's fine.

323
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:59,747
It's fine. God, it's fine.

324
00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:01,752
Baby...

325
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:10,043
It's been two weeks, Les.

326
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:12,696
Passing out, waking up,

327
00:28:12,963 --> 00:28:17,200
having flashes of nightmares
I can't fully remember.

328
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:18,484
We could try changing pills.

329
00:28:18,585 --> 00:28:20,904
No, no, no more pills.

330
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,208
What's the point, anyway?

331
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,530
At least my place is clean.

332
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,098
What?

333
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:36,436
When I... wake up, it smells like
I've been cleaning in my sleep.

334
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:39,622
What?

335
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,460
Nothing.

336
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:46,979
Look, why don't you record yourself?

337
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:48,664
- What?
- Set up a camera.

338
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:51,534
Get a better sense of what
you're doing in your sleep.

339
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:53,486
Monitor your patterns.

340
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:57,107
Can I show you something?

341
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:00,610
Um, sure.

342
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:03,430
I haven't even shown this to Josh.

343
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:08,752
Look.

344
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,020
At what?

345
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:11,488
Exactly.

346
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:16,026
My scar... where my head hit the steering wheel...

347
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:17,661
It's gone.

348
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:20,697
Like it never existed.

349
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,058
Scars fade, Sarah.

350
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:32,358
Really?

351
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,929
They fade completely and after only 3 months?

352
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,616
No.

353
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:43,002
What is happening to me?

354
00:29:45,673 --> 00:29:47,857
Jesus Christ, that damn dog.

355
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:48,975
Sorry.

356
00:29:49,143 --> 00:29:51,628
Buster, come here.

357
00:30:22,176 --> 00:30:24,743
Wait-wait-wait. Not yet, not yet.
Now, ready, ready, ready?

358
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:26,846
- OK, OK.
- Open.

359
00:30:26,948 --> 00:30:31,617
Oh, my fucking God. How did you get this?

360
00:30:31,718 --> 00:30:35,488
Oh, I made a few calls, called in a few favors.

361
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:38,358
- Hmm.
- This is ours for a week.

362
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,060
A week? Yeah.

363
00:30:40,161 --> 00:30:43,129
Wait, how did you do that? What
are we gonna do in a week?

364
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,231
Um...

365
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,967
Everything.

366
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:48,969
Oh, everything.

367
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,770
Yeah.

368
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:52,905
Everything.

369
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:40,153
Hi.

370
00:31:40,337 --> 00:31:42,372
Hi.

371
00:31:42,473 --> 00:31:44,558
Did you sleep well?

372
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:47,527
Like the dead.

373
00:31:47,628 --> 00:31:50,013
No night terrors?

374
00:31:50,114 --> 00:31:51,798
No.

375
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:56,019
Oh, must be the change of scenery, then.

376
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:59,873
Mmm-hmm... I could stay here forever.

377
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:04,010
Housekeeping.

378
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:06,696
Or until she comes.

379
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,051
Come back in a week.

380
00:32:23,414 --> 00:32:25,164
It was the best, Leslie.

381
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:27,484
A week of pampering, laying by the pool,

382
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:29,919
and finally, some peaceful sleeping.

383
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,023
I guess I was just stressed
out after all, you know?

384
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:41,297
Shit, Leslie, let me call you back.

385
00:33:43,377 --> 00:33:45,244
Oh, God.

386
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:53,920
I am so not in the mood.

387
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:56,255
Please don't come over, please
don't come over. Please don't...

388
00:33:56,356 --> 00:33:58,591
Oh, shit.

389
00:33:58,693 --> 00:34:00,310
Hey, Dale.

390
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:02,579
Hi, Sarah.

391
00:34:03,597 --> 00:34:05,915
Can I help you with something?

392
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:08,451
Where have you been?

393
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:09,836
Excuse me?

394
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:13,740
This last week, where have you been?

395
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:18,428
That's none of your business.

396
00:34:18,529 --> 00:34:22,648
Sorry, I was just worried about you.

397
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,118
Is everything OK?

398
00:34:25,252 --> 00:34:29,222
Everything's fine, thank you.

399
00:34:29,323 --> 00:34:32,975
Good... good.

400
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:36,162
Is there anything else?

401
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,998
Oh, no, sorry.

402
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:44,287
I'll see you later, Sarah.

403
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:41,597
Shoot, Dale.

404
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:44,267
You'd forget your head if it wasn't screwed on.

405
00:39:54,265 --> 00:39:56,566
<i>- Shoot.
- Oh, Dale.</i>

406
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:59,301
<i>I'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on.</i>

407
00:40:17,938 --> 00:40:19,405
What?

408
00:41:03,183 --> 00:41:06,552
OK... look to the left.

409
00:41:09,806 --> 00:41:10,806
Good.

410
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:13,442
To the right.

411
00:41:13,544 --> 00:41:15,161
Looks fine.

412
00:41:15,662 --> 00:41:18,931
And there's no sign of a wound.

413
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:21,651
- Do you have a headache?
- No.

414
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:25,621
- So, this wasn't a night terror, but a...
- I don't know.

415
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:27,689
- A black out?
- I don't know, I don't know, I...

416
00:41:27,757 --> 00:41:29,141
Take your time.

417
00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:31,759
I don't-I don't fucking know, Les. I mean, I-I-I...

418
00:41:31,845 --> 00:41:34,663
I think I went to go out for a run and then...

419
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:38,584
I don't know, I'm waking up on
the couch in the other room.

420
00:41:38,585 --> 00:41:42,985
- Do you remember falling over?
- Look, even if I did, how did I end up there?

421
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:46,558
Oh, my God, oh, my God. Not again.

422
00:41:54,434 --> 00:41:58,237
I'd come and hold you hair back,
but I'm a sympathetic vomiter.

423
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,075
Sarah, you OK?

424
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,848
What the fuck is going on?

425
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:11,768
A repercussion from the car accident, maybe?

426
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:16,055
Let's see the neurologist again, get an MRI.

427
00:42:16,156 --> 00:42:17,974
Just give me a moment.

428
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:19,709
Yeah.

429
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:51,039
Here, this'll calm your nerves.

430
00:42:52,692 --> 00:42:54,693
I'm pregnant.

431
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:02,518
You don't seem too thrilled.

432
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:06,122
I just can't believe it.

433
00:43:06,223 --> 00:43:08,491
That's how I first felt.

434
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:12,996
Congratulations.

435
00:43:13,097 --> 00:43:14,998
I guess so.

436
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:16,299
You guess so?

437
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,235
Come on, this is what you wanted, right?

438
00:43:19,336 --> 00:43:22,538
Hey, I'm sure Josh'll be over the moon.

439
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,507
Give me a call when you feel better.

440
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:27,743
I'll do a blood test to confirm the good news.

441
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,817
Hey, Dale.

442
00:43:40,924 --> 00:43:43,393
Hi, Sarah.

443
00:43:43,894 --> 00:43:49,262
Look, I... I know this may seem weird,
but... have you been home all day?

444
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,068
Did you see me go for a run or anything?

445
00:43:53,603 --> 00:43:55,654
You didn't see me fall?

446
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,458
Are you OK?

447
00:44:00,844 --> 00:44:02,144
I don't know.

448
00:44:02,245 --> 00:44:03,396
Dale?

449
00:44:03,497 --> 00:44:05,398
Oh, hello, Dr. Dell.

450
00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:07,266
You two know each other?

451
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:12,053
Dale used to deliver my groceries until, uhh...

452
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:14,607
Why did you stop?

453
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,893
I don't like dogs.

454
00:44:16,994 --> 00:44:20,062
Ah, Buster.

455
00:44:20,163 --> 00:44:22,231
Sorry to bother you, Dale.

456
00:44:22,332 --> 00:44:24,133
Bye, Dale.

457
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,854
Just go in and tell him.

458
00:44:52,963 --> 00:44:56,530
I often get told there's a hot babe waiting for
me at the bar, but none of them are this smokin'.

459
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:59,501
Oh, I think we can do much better than that.

460
00:44:59,502 --> 00:45:02,438
Johnny, uh, something a little
stronger for my lady friend, here.

461
00:45:02,439 --> 00:45:05,458
- I can't, Josh.
- Oh, come on, Tequila.

462
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,043
I already tried, bud.

463
00:45:07,144 --> 00:45:08,845
Josh...

464
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,180
I can't.

465
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,583
Wha...

466
00:45:14,684 --> 00:45:16,786
are you?

467
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:26,461
See you soon, Paul.

468
00:45:26,962 --> 00:45:30,032
It's alright, babe. I'll see myself out.

469
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:31,801
Are you sure you're OK?

470
00:45:31,902 --> 00:45:33,803
Yeah, yeah, just, uh...

471
00:45:33,904 --> 00:45:35,504
surprised.

472
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:38,672
- Yeah, well, that's what happens when a man...
- Yeah, I get how it works.

473
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:40,475
I love you so much.

474
00:45:40,576 --> 00:45:42,111
I'll see you at home.

475
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:51,369
Shot of whiskey.

476
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,722
Listen, listen, man,

477
00:45:52,723 --> 00:45:55,522
- I know what you're thinking...
- Just...

478
00:46:07,403 --> 00:46:09,471
Just keep 'em coming.

479
00:46:38,067 --> 00:46:39,668
Josh?

480
00:46:52,883 --> 00:46:54,149
Oops, sorry.

481
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,619
Jesus Christ, Josh.

482
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,954
What, you didn't hear me calling out?

483
00:47:00,073 --> 00:47:01,823
I mean, what are you even doing home?

484
00:47:03,744 --> 00:47:06,011
Did something happen at work?

485
00:47:07,947 --> 00:47:09,282
Talk to me.

486
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:13,669
OK, fine, well can you at least
clean up the broken glass?

487
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:24,562
In, uh, in college, like everyone else,
I was-I was, up for some extra cash.

488
00:47:25,815 --> 00:47:28,316
Some buddies of mine were...

489
00:47:28,418 --> 00:47:31,136
getting beer money by donating their...

490
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:36,959
So, I gave it a shot.

491
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:41,564
But I was politely turned away.

492
00:47:41,665 --> 00:47:44,733
Apparently, my, uh, count was...

493
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:48,004
zero.

494
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:58,680
I've-I've wanted so badly to tell you.

495
00:47:59,782 --> 00:48:03,902
You know, at the... when we were
staying at the casino and...

496
00:48:04,003 --> 00:48:06,923
well, since we've been married.

497
00:48:07,024 --> 00:48:09,691
And I-I've seen every fucking specialist around,

498
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:11,894
but the diagnosis is always the same:

499
00:48:11,995 --> 00:48:15,097
"Hey, sorry, kid, you're shootin' blanks."

500
00:48:15,198 --> 00:48:18,467
But, you can't be.

501
00:48:18,568 --> 00:48:23,306
Oh, well... there's the thing.

502
00:48:23,407 --> 00:48:25,808
I'm sterile, and you're pregnant.

503
00:48:25,892 --> 00:48:30,062
Now, I'm no Einstein, but you
know, I can add that one up.

504
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:34,815
I don't wanna know whose it is or how
long it's been going on. I just, I-I...

505
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:38,086
Wait! Wait, what is going on?

506
00:48:38,087 --> 00:48:41,488
Well, that's what I'd like to know,
Sarah, but I really don't wanna hear it.

507
00:48:41,524 --> 00:48:44,091
- What, you're leaving me?!
- Well, what did you expect?!

508
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:45,361
Sarah!

509
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:49,830
Wha-wh... what, do you want me to sit around and
rejoice the fact that you're cheating on me?

510
00:48:49,832 --> 00:48:54,600
- I... I could never cheat on you.
- Oh, well, then what is this, huh? What?

511
00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:56,571
I-immaculate conception?

512
00:48:56,672 --> 00:49:00,340
- Josh, don't go.
- No, no, I should've expected this.

513
00:49:00,577 --> 00:49:04,579
Yeah, what with you sitting around
watching that nasty shit all day.

514
00:49:09,185 --> 00:49:11,853
Look, OK, you're drunk, you can't drive.

515
00:49:11,954 --> 00:49:14,523
Oh, I'm gonna drink a shitload more...

516
00:49:14,624 --> 00:49:16,192
until I pass out...

517
00:49:16,293 --> 00:49:19,662
hopefully wake up, and all this
is some fucking nightmare.

518
00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:22,264
What the fuck is happening?!

519
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:26,068
You got what you wanted.

520
00:49:26,169 --> 00:49:28,103
That's what's happening.

521
00:49:28,204 --> 00:49:30,005
No, Josh, Josh, please!

522
00:49:30,022 --> 00:49:31,156
Leave me alone.

523
00:50:41,077 --> 00:50:44,994
<i>Alright, you've reached Josh McClaren. Uh,
leave a message, and I'll get back to you.</i>

524
00:50:53,723 --> 00:50:55,073
Josh?

525
00:50:55,074 --> 00:50:58,624
- It's me. I'm coming over.
- No, please, I'm fine.

526
00:50:58,711 --> 00:51:01,512
<i>You're not. You sounded terrible today.
You shouldn't be alone.</i>

527
00:51:01,581 --> 00:51:03,949
Look, I'm not gonna be much company.

528
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:05,768
Never thought you were.

529
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:07,118
<i>See you soon.</i>

530
00:51:15,195 --> 00:51:18,280
OK, in ya go. That's it.

531
00:51:18,347 --> 00:51:22,418
How many of those pills did you have?

532
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,787
Good, Buster, you stay there.

533
00:51:24,854 --> 00:51:27,323
OK, in ya go.

534
00:51:27,424 --> 00:51:29,090
There you go.

535
00:51:33,062 --> 00:51:35,931
- We'll be right here, OK?
- Thank you.

536
00:51:36,032 --> 00:51:39,700
- That's it, just relax.
- OK.

537
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,838
You good, Buster?

538
00:52:49,673 --> 00:52:51,991
Jesus, Buster.

539
00:52:53,676 --> 00:52:55,728
Sarah, it's OK, go back to sleep.

540
00:52:56,963 --> 00:52:59,448
Buster, come here.

541
00:53:06,739 --> 00:53:08,106
Buster.

542
00:53:14,363 --> 00:53:15,847
Buster, shh!

543
00:53:17,934 --> 00:53:20,636
Buster, come on, seriously?

544
00:53:20,737 --> 00:53:22,237
Shh!

545
00:53:24,941 --> 00:53:29,311
Buster... Josh, is that you? It's Leslie.

546
00:53:31,648 --> 00:53:33,181
Buster!

547
00:53:33,899 --> 00:53:35,399
Buster?!

548
00:53:40,256 --> 00:53:41,840
Come, buddy.

549
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:44,076
Buster.

550
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:45,961
Buster!

551
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,267
Buster?!

552
00:53:56,839 --> 00:53:58,523
Come on, come on, buddy.

553
00:54:14,357 --> 00:54:16,091
Leslie?

554
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:19,594
Leslie?

555
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:50,992
Is that Buster?

556
00:54:53,479 --> 00:54:54,729
Buster, Buster!

557
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:56,047
Come here, buddy. Come here.

558
00:54:56,148 --> 00:54:58,667
Why is the door open? Buster!

559
00:54:58,734 --> 00:55:00,335
Buster, come in, buddy.

560
00:55:01,303 --> 00:55:02,537
Buster!

561
00:55:04,698 --> 00:55:05,998
Buster!

562
00:55:14,717 --> 00:55:16,435
Sarah!

563
00:55:18,437 --> 00:55:20,021
What?

564
00:55:36,972 --> 00:55:38,473
Sarah?

565
00:55:39,942 --> 00:55:42,277
There's a beautiful baby boy waiting to meet you.

566
00:55:42,378 --> 00:55:44,179
Thank you.

567
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:49,218
Hey. Congratulations!

568
00:55:53,388 --> 00:55:57,058
Let me take a look at the little man.

569
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:05,100
I guess I don't know who the father is, after all.

570
00:56:15,745 --> 00:56:17,095
Beer?

571
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,814
I gotta go to work, man.

572
00:56:18,915 --> 00:56:21,866
Come on, you're a bartender,
you're not a brain surgeon.

573
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:28,273
I thought you were gonna go home last night.

574
00:56:28,674 --> 00:56:30,475
Didn't know what to say.

575
00:56:30,576 --> 00:56:35,530
Well, "let's talk" is usually
a good place to start.

576
00:56:35,631 --> 00:56:37,966
Shit, man, stop being such a pussy.

577
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:40,769
Yeah, she's your wife, for Christ sake.

578
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:44,087
I mean, even that ought to entitle
her to a-a civil hearing.

579
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:46,356
Uh, pretty sure you lose that right
when you fuck someone else.

580
00:56:46,358 --> 00:56:48,793
Oh, come-come on. Seriously? Get
off your high horse, alright?

581
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:51,095
'Cause it's not like you've
been honest with her, is it?

582
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,683
Look, man...

583
00:56:54,818 --> 00:56:58,553
I might just be some
cocktail-slinging stoner, right?

584
00:56:58,654 --> 00:57:00,889
But even I believe good
things happen to good people.

585
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:03,558
Now, you thought you were shooting blanks, right?

586
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:07,329
It only takes one little swimmer to make a baby.

587
00:57:09,065 --> 00:57:13,065
You let Sarah go without a fight,
you're more of a fuck-up than I am.

588
00:57:13,152 --> 00:57:15,053
Think about that.

589
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:19,907
Go ahead, go take a shower, change
out of that stinking uniform,

590
00:57:20,008 --> 00:57:23,778
and please, hey, please, at least give her a call.

591
00:57:41,764 --> 00:57:42,798
Hello?

592
00:57:42,899 --> 00:57:43,948
It's me.

593
00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:46,751
Hey, uh, how are you?

594
00:57:46,752 --> 00:57:48,536
I wanna leave already.

595
00:57:48,637 --> 00:57:51,206
For a doctor, I really hate hospitals.

596
00:57:51,307 --> 00:57:52,674
How's the little one?

597
00:57:52,775 --> 00:57:54,175
<i>He's good.</i>

598
00:57:56,445 --> 00:57:58,363
I think you should stay at my place tonight.

599
00:57:58,464 --> 00:58:00,247
<i>- I can't.
- Please.</i>

600
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,036
I don't know what's going on, but I sure as

601
00:58:04,037 --> 00:58:05,603
hell don't think you should
be at your place on your own.

602
00:58:05,704 --> 00:58:09,274
<i>Exactly. I don't know what's going
on, and I need to find out, Les.</i>

603
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:12,144
I... I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

604
00:58:18,234 --> 00:58:19,818
<i>Just like the last time...</i>

605
00:59:16,993 --> 00:59:19,094
<i>Shh.</i>

606
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:21,696
<i>Shh, it'll be just like last time.</i>

607
00:59:34,376 --> 00:59:36,844
<i>You didn't like my other music...</i>

608
00:59:36,945 --> 00:59:39,431
<i>so maybe this will relax you.</i>

609
00:59:47,706 --> 00:59:49,524
Dale?

610
00:59:53,011 --> 00:59:55,329
<i>Would you like to dance?</i>

611
01:00:17,152 --> 01:00:18,453
<i>Rainbridge Farms.</i>

612
01:00:18,554 --> 01:00:20,838
<i>You introduced me to these, remember?</i>

613
01:01:42,521 --> 01:01:44,806
<i>Can't stay long tonight.</i>

614
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:50,011
<i>But I can't wait to see you again tomorrow.</i>

615
01:02:20,443 --> 01:02:24,813
<i>I really love our time together.</i>

616
01:02:24,914 --> 01:02:26,914
<i>I think you're the one.</i>

617
01:02:39,461 --> 01:02:40,995
I'm dead?

618
01:02:41,096 --> 01:02:42,430
I'm dead?

619
01:02:42,531 --> 01:02:44,048
I'm fucking dead?

620
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:47,636
He killed me?

621
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,887
He killed me?

622
01:04:13,188 --> 01:04:15,023
Impossible.

623
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:18,026
He killed you.

624
01:04:19,194 --> 01:04:20,929
I just saw him kill you.

625
01:04:20,996 --> 01:04:22,046
What is this?

626
01:04:22,047 --> 01:04:26,316
- This is what's been happening since he moved in.
- You've gotta go to the police.

627
01:04:26,351 --> 01:04:27,434
And tell them what?

628
01:04:27,436 --> 01:04:29,587
My fucking neighbor is killing me?

629
01:04:29,688 --> 01:04:31,156
You've got it all on tape.

630
01:04:31,257 --> 01:04:34,659
But I'm alive, Leslie. If I go to the
police, they're gonna think it's fake.

631
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:39,930
That it's a joke, that I doctored
it somehow, it's special effects.

632
01:04:40,431 --> 01:04:43,217
I'm a hundred percent normal.

633
01:04:43,218 --> 01:04:45,653
Perfectly healthy.

634
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:48,757
No signs of trauma, anywhere.

635
01:04:50,593 --> 01:04:53,361
He breathed into me.

636
01:04:53,462 --> 01:04:56,280
He just breathed into me.

637
01:04:56,681 --> 01:04:59,434
And it all went away.

638
01:05:00,285 --> 01:05:02,253
Every cut...

639
01:05:02,354 --> 01:05:05,407
every scar.

640
01:05:05,508 --> 01:05:07,441
Let me show you something.

641
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:11,278
I did multiple searches trying to
figure out what the fuck was going on.

642
01:05:11,279 --> 01:05:14,265
Dale plus bring back the dead,
Dale plus resurrection,

643
01:05:14,283 --> 01:05:17,134
Dale plus back to life.

644
01:05:17,236 --> 01:05:19,204
And then I found this.

645
01:05:21,023 --> 01:05:23,908
This is what the first cop on the scene said.

646
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,363
"I saw her body. It was everywhere.

647
01:05:29,464 --> 01:05:31,750
"It made me sick.

648
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:34,818
"There's no way she could've been alive.

649
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,940
It's like she was somehow brought back to life."

650
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:42,960
And the only other person in the house...

651
01:05:43,061 --> 01:05:46,164
was the woman's 14-year-old son.

652
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:50,301
Dale.

653
01:05:50,385 --> 01:05:52,537
And then I found this.

654
01:05:54,856 --> 01:05:58,976
She's a patient at the Nevada
State Mental Institution.

655
01:06:00,096 --> 01:06:01,212
Jesus, Sarah, what are you doing?

656
01:06:01,313 --> 01:06:03,864
I'm gonna find out who the fuck my neighbor is.

657
01:06:03,865 --> 01:06:05,600
Be careful, OK?

658
01:06:05,617 --> 01:06:06,717
Please.

659
01:06:06,819 --> 01:06:10,071
You have a baby to think about, remember?

660
01:06:10,172 --> 01:06:13,023
It's not Josh's.

661
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:32,042
<i>Remember... a while back, I was
experiencing something similar.</i>

662
01:06:32,143 --> 01:06:37,832
<i>Waking at odd hours... panicking
with this strange feeling.</i>

663
01:06:37,933 --> 01:06:40,184
<i>That is why I adopted Buster.</i>

664
01:06:40,285 --> 01:06:43,521
<i>Dale used to deliver my groceries until...</i>

665
01:06:43,622 --> 01:06:45,556
<i>Why did you stop?</i>

666
01:06:46,224 --> 01:06:48,376
<i>I don't like dogs.</i>

667
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:13,851
- I heard you the first ten times.
- I'm sorry, I'm just a little...

668
01:07:13,852 --> 01:07:16,120
look, I-I need to see Eileen Wallace.

669
01:07:17,473 --> 01:07:18,673
Excuse me?

670
01:07:18,757 --> 01:07:19,873
Eileen Wallace. It's urgent.

671
01:07:19,975 --> 01:07:22,043
Do you have an appointment?

672
01:07:22,144 --> 01:07:24,510
- No, I was just hoping...
- Not without an appointment.

673
01:07:24,513 --> 01:07:28,580
Look, fuck the appointment, OK? I need to see
her, and I'm not gonna leave here until I do.

674
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:41,545
Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you, Dr.
Simmons, but, um, I have a, um...

675
01:07:41,546 --> 01:07:43,598
Sarah, Sarah McClaren.

676
01:07:43,699 --> 01:07:47,735
Sarah McClaren. She's here to see Ms. Wallace.

677
01:07:49,888 --> 01:07:51,505
About what?

678
01:07:53,225 --> 01:07:54,726
Her son.

679
01:07:55,944 --> 01:07:58,279
This is highly irregular, Mrs. McClaren, but...

680
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:00,081
it was her decision.

681
01:08:00,182 --> 01:08:03,684
I told her what you look like,
and she agreed to talk to you.

682
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,821
So, I see you do one thing to upset her,

683
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:11,259
I'll have you outta there so
fast, it'll make your head spin.

684
01:08:15,063 --> 01:08:16,364
Ready?

685
01:08:22,771 --> 01:08:26,173
Mrs. McClaren, this is Eileen.

686
01:08:28,811 --> 01:08:30,378
Ten minutes.

687
01:08:46,562 --> 01:08:49,130
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Wallace.

688
01:08:52,368 --> 01:08:55,603
I wouldn't think so.

689
01:08:55,704 --> 01:08:58,355
Not under such...

690
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:01,308
circumstances.

691
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:05,446
Dr. Simmons told me what you look like.

692
01:09:08,284 --> 01:09:10,518
Pretty.

693
01:09:10,619 --> 01:09:12,420
Blonde.

694
01:09:15,641 --> 01:09:20,612
Dale... has a type, you see.

695
01:09:20,713 --> 01:09:24,381
I guess it reminds him of me.

696
01:09:24,483 --> 01:09:29,237
He recently moved across from us, and...

697
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:34,024
I have proof he's been coming into our house.

698
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:36,210
Murdering you?

699
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:44,835
It's what he does...

700
01:09:46,805 --> 01:09:50,074
Ever since he was 14 years old.

701
01:09:50,175 --> 01:09:54,828
Since he first discovered his gift.

702
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,886
<i>The night my husband killed me...</i>

703
01:10:02,987 --> 01:10:05,022
<i>You hear that bang, mama?</i>

704
01:10:05,123 --> 01:10:08,125
<i>I think they got him.</i>

705
01:10:08,226 --> 01:10:11,028
<i>It's gonna be alright now.</i>

706
01:10:13,898 --> 01:10:16,166
<i>Mama?</i>

707
01:10:42,478 --> 01:10:43,744
<i>Kid?</i>

708
01:10:43,845 --> 01:10:46,714
<i>Dale, come on, man. Where you at?</i>

709
01:10:46,815 --> 01:10:49,867
<i>Dale? What the fuck?</i>

710
01:10:50,885 --> 01:10:52,253
<i>Kid, get down!</i>

711
01:10:52,354 --> 01:10:54,005
<i>Get away from the boy!</i>

712
01:10:54,789 --> 01:10:56,607
<i>Get the fuck away from the boy!</i>

713
01:10:57,275 --> 01:11:00,310
<i>It's OK, this is my mom.</i>

714
01:11:04,366 --> 01:11:06,283
I couldn't remember a thing.

715
01:11:06,384 --> 01:11:07,735
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

716
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:15,276
Later... at the hospital, once I was
told I was perfectly healthy...

717
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:20,381
Dale told me he just breathed into my mouth...

718
01:11:20,482 --> 01:11:23,250
like he saw on TV.

719
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:28,088
After that...

720
01:11:28,873 --> 01:11:31,025
he became obsessed...

721
01:11:31,126 --> 01:11:33,427
with his ability.

722
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:35,663
<i>He's not right.</i>

723
01:11:35,764 --> 01:11:38,065
<i>He's not right in the head.</i>

724
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:40,368
<i>He's got the Holy Spirit in him.</i>

725
01:11:40,469 --> 01:11:42,303
<i>But look what he does with it...</i>

726
01:11:42,404 --> 01:11:44,937
<i>Mama... please.</i>

727
01:11:45,073 --> 01:11:51,977
<i>I find... knives and clothes in
his room, with blood on them.</i>

728
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:56,279
<i>- Would you keep your voice down?
- You see? You see? You're afraid of him, too.</i>

729
01:11:56,351 --> 01:11:58,035
<i>Stop talking this way, mama.</i>

730
01:11:58,136 --> 01:12:00,387
<i>Dale is not evil.</i>

731
01:12:00,488 --> 01:12:02,857
<i>He's just a boy.</i>

732
01:12:02,958 --> 01:12:06,344
<i>And God help us all when he becomes a man.</i>

733
01:12:27,483 --> 01:12:29,484
<i>Come back to me.</i>

734
01:12:50,806 --> 01:12:54,742
Nothing, no one was safe.

735
01:13:17,816 --> 01:13:19,167
<i>No!</i>

736
01:13:19,868 --> 01:13:21,151
<i>Dale!</i>

737
01:13:21,152 --> 01:13:22,720
<i>Stop that!</i>

738
01:13:22,821 --> 01:13:24,956
<i>You stop that right now!</i>

739
01:13:25,057 --> 01:13:28,192
<i>You have got to stop doing this!</i>

740
01:13:28,194 --> 01:13:31,812
<i>Why? I always bring them back.</i>

741
01:13:33,331 --> 01:13:34,715
<i>Back off, mama!</i>

742
01:13:35,466 --> 01:13:37,885
<i>You want me to start killing you?</i>

743
01:13:43,842 --> 01:13:46,293
<i>Bring her back.</i>

744
01:13:46,394 --> 01:13:49,013
<i>Please?</i>

745
01:13:49,114 --> 01:13:51,965
<i>It's time for you to bring her back.</i>

746
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:54,335
<i>Make me cookies first.</i>

747
01:13:55,754 --> 01:13:56,971
<i>Now!</i>

748
01:14:07,499 --> 01:14:10,451
<i>Bring her back now, Dale.</i>

749
01:14:11,702 --> 01:14:13,437
<i>For mama.</i>

750
01:14:16,641 --> 01:14:18,675
<i>You promised.</i>

751
01:14:28,053 --> 01:14:31,322
I couldn't take it anymore.

752
01:14:34,843 --> 01:14:39,179
I couldn't live knowing that Dale came from me...

753
01:14:41,099 --> 01:14:43,800
that I was somehow responsible...

754
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:47,404
for creating a monster.

755
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:05,189
But whatever I did to get away...

756
01:15:07,142 --> 01:15:10,261
he always brought me back.

757
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:21,505
<i>Come back to me.</i>

758
01:15:33,551 --> 01:15:34,952
<i>No.</i>

759
01:15:35,053 --> 01:15:37,538
<i>No!</i>

760
01:15:37,639 --> 01:15:40,190
<i>No!</i>

761
01:15:44,529 --> 01:15:48,248
<i>Why do you wanna leave me, mama?</i>

762
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:50,818
<i>I need you, I love you.</i>

763
01:15:51,903 --> 01:15:53,621
<i>You can kill yourself again and again,</i>

764
01:15:53,722 --> 01:15:56,307
<i>but I will always bring you back!</i>

765
01:15:59,995 --> 01:16:01,896
<i>You can't leave me.</i>

766
01:16:01,997 --> 01:16:03,130
I knew what I had to do.

767
01:16:03,231 --> 01:16:05,666
<i>Please, you can't ever leave me.</i>

768
01:16:05,767 --> 01:16:10,888
After all, desperate times
call for drastic measures.

769
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:25,335
<i>Mrs. Wallace, Mrs. Wallace.</i>

770
01:16:25,436 --> 01:16:27,270
<i>Mrs. Wallace, Mrs. Wallace, you need a...</i>

771
01:16:27,371 --> 01:16:30,124
<i>- Put that down, Mrs. Wallace!
- Put it down, Mrs. Wallace!</i>

772
01:16:30,225 --> 01:16:31,575
<i>- No! Don't do this!
- Get back!</i>

773
01:16:31,676 --> 01:16:33,777
<i>- Mrs. Wallace!
- Don't do that, Mrs. Wallace!</i>

774
01:16:43,538 --> 01:16:47,725
If I didn't die that day...

775
01:16:47,825 --> 01:16:50,861
I was hoping for the next best thing...

776
01:16:53,214 --> 01:16:55,482
to end up here...

777
01:16:56,601 --> 01:16:59,836
where he could no longer get to me.

778
01:16:59,971 --> 01:17:04,007
But it seems there was only one way to
stop him, so why didn't you just...

779
01:17:04,109 --> 01:17:05,675
Kill him?

780
01:17:07,095 --> 01:17:10,998
You must not have kids, or you
would know the answer to that.

781
01:17:14,036 --> 01:17:18,255
Dale... never really grew up.

782
01:17:18,356 --> 01:17:21,474
Once he discovered what he could do...

783
01:17:21,576 --> 01:17:27,998
he never... developed... socially.

784
01:17:28,099 --> 01:17:30,434
Why would he?

785
01:17:30,535 --> 01:17:34,037
He used his gift to get the girls.

786
01:17:38,276 --> 01:17:41,044
Killing...

787
01:17:41,146 --> 01:17:44,848
and bringing you back...

788
01:17:44,949 --> 01:17:48,102
that's how he connects.

789
01:17:49,036 --> 01:17:51,839
That's how he loves.

790
01:17:51,856 --> 01:17:54,941
If this has been going on for a while...

791
01:17:56,344 --> 01:18:00,096
you must be very special to him.

792
01:18:00,198 --> 01:18:02,249
But how...

793
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:05,452
how does he do what he does?

794
01:18:06,788 --> 01:18:10,390
That is one of life's cruel ironies.

795
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,194
I mean...

796
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:21,184
why would God give a Christ-like
gift to the very devil himself?

797
01:18:23,154 --> 01:18:26,107
I know where you can get a gun.

798
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:28,508
You find him in your home again...

799
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:32,579
you do what you have to do to stop him.

800
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,232
Please.

801
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,668
Promise me you'll stop him.

802
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:35,376
<i>- Shit.
- Alright, you've reached Josh McClaren.</i>

803
01:19:35,394 --> 01:19:36,876
<i>Uh, leave a message and I'll get back to you.</i>

804
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:40,478
Josh, Josh, it's me. Listen, I need to see you, OK?

805
01:19:40,548 --> 01:19:42,082
I know what's been going on.

806
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:44,818
I have proof, and I just visited...

807
01:19:44,919 --> 01:19:47,871
just listen, don't leave
Johnny's, and call me back, OK?

808
01:19:47,921 --> 01:19:51,791
don't go home! Please, whatever
you do, don't go home!

809
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:53,026
Fuck!

810
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:12,929
Sarah?

811
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:22,839
Sarah?

812
01:20:26,077 --> 01:20:27,744
Sarah?

813
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:32,666
Sarah?

814
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,135
Josh?

815
01:21:58,135 --> 01:21:59,754
Josh?

816
01:22:34,339 --> 01:22:36,406
No, no, no!

817
01:22:36,507 --> 01:22:38,609
Josh, no!

818
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:42,360
No, no, stay with me! Oh, stay with me!

819
01:22:52,473 --> 01:22:54,691
Hi, Sarah.

820
01:22:57,278 --> 01:22:59,362
Welcome home.

821
01:23:00,998 --> 01:23:03,366
Y-y-y-you wanna shoot me, too?

822
01:23:03,468 --> 01:23:05,485
That's not fair.

823
01:23:05,586 --> 01:23:07,570
It's not like you can bring me back.

824
01:23:07,755 --> 01:23:09,423
Dale, can you please...

825
01:23:09,524 --> 01:23:11,558
Please bring him back?

826
01:23:12,627 --> 01:23:14,594
But I didn't kill him, Sarah.

827
01:23:14,596 --> 01:23:16,663
- You did.
- Bring him back!

828
01:23:16,764 --> 01:23:18,798
No, I won't! Do you hear me?!

829
01:23:18,799 --> 01:23:21,601
Never, ever! He doesn't deserve you!

830
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:28,625
It's better-it's better this way.

831
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:31,227
I heard you two fighting the other night.

832
01:23:32,347 --> 01:23:34,665
I was here.

833
01:23:34,766 --> 01:23:36,166
He's mean.

834
01:23:36,267 --> 01:23:40,020
He left you. He doesn't wanna
take care of you any more.

835
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:46,259
I don't wanna kill you again, Sarah.

836
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:49,279
I'm just so tired from all of the...

837
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:52,766
the cleaning.

838
01:23:52,867 --> 01:23:53,900
But don't get me wrong.

839
01:23:54,001 --> 01:23:57,170
I still want us to be together.

840
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:01,007
I want us to be together...

841
01:24:01,776 --> 01:24:04,144
as a family.

842
01:24:13,154 --> 01:24:15,772
Do you wanna be normal, Dale?

843
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:21,328
You promise?

844
01:24:31,689 --> 01:24:33,724
Are you hungry?

845
01:24:45,319 --> 01:24:46,619
Homemade.

846
01:24:46,821 --> 01:24:49,423
Just the way you like them.

847
01:24:51,825 --> 01:24:54,161
Oh, this is nice.

848
01:24:57,398 --> 01:24:58,999
To us?

849
01:25:00,184 --> 01:25:02,202
Yeah, to us.

850
01:25:07,975 --> 01:25:10,243
I don't have to use this, do I?

851
01:25:10,345 --> 01:25:13,430
Not if you don't want to.

852
01:25:26,627 --> 01:25:29,512
- Try not to eat too many.
- Why?

853
01:25:29,614 --> 01:25:32,949
I don't want you ruining your appetite.

854
01:25:50,251 --> 01:25:52,502
Let's go upstairs.

855
01:26:00,828 --> 01:26:03,296
Wha-what are we doing?

856
01:26:03,397 --> 01:26:05,131
What do you think?

857
01:26:08,485 --> 01:26:09,502
But...

858
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:11,538
But what?

859
01:26:12,657 --> 01:26:15,008
You want to, don't you?

860
01:26:15,109 --> 01:26:16,877
You want it to be normal, right?

861
01:26:16,978 --> 01:26:19,379
Yeah, of course, but...

862
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:24,484
normally, you can't remember anything afterwards.

863
01:26:24,486 --> 01:26:26,853
I want to remember, Dale.

864
01:26:27,038 --> 01:26:30,690
I want to remember everything
that happens between us.

865
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:34,628
That's what being a real couple is all about.

866
01:26:34,729 --> 01:26:36,713
Trust me.

867
01:26:38,433 --> 01:26:42,469
- What if you think that I'm really...
- Oh, shh.

868
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:45,171
You're gonna be perfect.

869
01:26:46,774 --> 01:26:49,209
Do you like the way I look, Dale?

870
01:26:51,228 --> 01:26:53,496
Do you like my eyes?

871
01:26:58,769 --> 01:27:00,887
My lips?

872
01:27:02,673 --> 01:27:04,074
My hair?

873
01:27:08,713 --> 01:27:10,297
My breasts?

874
01:27:11,882 --> 01:27:15,102
Yeah, they're the best.

875
01:27:17,805 --> 01:27:20,373
Kiss me, Dale.

876
01:27:20,474 --> 01:27:22,142
Kiss me, Dale.

877
01:27:22,994 --> 01:27:24,644
Kiss me, now!

878
01:27:31,302 --> 01:27:33,102
You're tricking me.

879
01:27:51,739 --> 01:27:53,189
Get up.

880
01:27:53,291 --> 01:27:55,492
Ahh!

881
01:28:05,919 --> 01:28:08,171
Come back to me!

882
01:28:55,519 --> 01:28:57,704
Liar, liar, liar!

883
01:28:59,273 --> 01:29:01,558
You're just like mama!

884
01:29:01,659 --> 01:29:04,794
You wanna leave me, too.

885
01:29:04,895 --> 01:29:07,163
Well, you're not going to.

886
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,852
'Cause I'm gonna leave you first!

887
01:29:17,241 --> 01:29:19,159
What the fuck is going on?!

888
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:21,444
Come here.

889
01:29:45,519 --> 01:29:49,372
I think it's time you both die...

890
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:51,691
for the last time.

891
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,902
Come back to me.
