1
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:43,562
Your mother is dead.

2
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,837
I did not know that she had passed.

3
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:49,242
How could you?

4
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,668
If I had known that she
had been sick, I'd...

5
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:01,004
You would've done what?

6
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:04,856
You would've come home
if you knew she was dying?

7
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:09,429
But you couldn't come home when she
was living, when she was full of hope?

8
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:23,176
How did she pass?

9
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,350
In my arms,

10
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,554
lying beside me in bed.

11
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:36,290
Weeping.

12
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:40,326
Calling out your name.

13
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,771
Is it your plan to stay a while?

14
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:51,405
Not sure yet.

15
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:56,642
You don't wear guns.

16
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,485
I put them away. I'm done with that.

17
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,420
What is that supposed to mean?

18
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:13,360
It means I don't know if a man
can get away from who he is.

19
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:16,629
And you think you know who I am?

20
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:19,199
I thought I did.

21
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,262
I'll be back. I have to go into town.

22
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,598
I'll go with ya.

23
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,786
Morning, Reverend.

24
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:58,290
And I'll be right with you, sir,
just as soon as I...

25
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,161
- Lord sakes! John Henry, is that you?
- Hello, Mr. Parsons.

26
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:08,443
Lord almighty, John Henry. I ain't
seen you since you went off to war.

27
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:12,272
I asked the saloon to order some
sipping cider from Cheyenne for me.

28
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:15,208
Would you see if it's arrived please?

29
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,709
Mr. Parsons.

30
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:21,614
Must do your heart good
to see the boy again.

31
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:24,284
I have a list.

32
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,297
Reverend Clayton sent me
to pick up his cider.

33
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:41,201
- And who are you?
- His son, John Henry.

34
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:51,726
Well, well, well.

35
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,877
If it ain't John Henry Clayton.

36
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:00,686
I heard a lot about you.

37
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,790
Name's Frank Tillman.

38
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,506
Maybe you heard of me?

39
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:08,643
Can't say as I have.

40
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:13,966
Well, I killed 4 men.

41
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:17,917
Still don't ring a bell.

42
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,611
How come you ain't wearing a gun?

43
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:28,663
You go and...

44
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:31,799
get religion or something?

45
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,118
Git!

46
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:35,187
Stop pestering our guests.

47
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,586
Git.

48
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:51,871
My name is Dave Turner.

49
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:54,673
Some call me Gentleman Dave.

50
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:58,417
Yeah... I heard of you.

51
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:04,750
You're gonna have to forgive
my compatriots.

52
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,453
Boredom often gets the best of 'em.

53
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:10,244
I had the good fortune

54
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:15,160
of watching you rid this world
of Big Jim Westfield

55
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,364
down in Coldwell County a few years back.

56
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:21,971
Most impressive.

57
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:27,006
May I ask what brings you to Fowler?

58
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:35,982
I'm only trying to ascertain
the nature of our relationship.

59
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,191
I'm hoping there won't be any trouble.

60
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,324
Not from me.

61
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,184
I don't recall things being so prosperous.

62
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:59,339
Prosperous to some. Railroad's coming.

63
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:02,445
Buggy's not gonna load itself.

64
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:09,347
Take these.

65
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,183
Take this. Don't you spend it all at once.

66
00:13:12,283 --> 00:13:14,486
Mr. McCurdy,

67
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:18,419
guess who was just in here
not 5 minutes ago?

68
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:21,626
John Henry Clayton.

69
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:28,333
- Is he gonna be a problem?
- He didn't look too tough to me.

70
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:31,336
I'm not asking you.

71
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,176
Is he gonna be a problem?

72
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,578
He was not wearing a sidearm.

73
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:43,816
That doesn't mean he can't put one on.

74
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:47,152
If he takes his pa's side in this...

75
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:49,689
it could be a problem.

76
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,856
Well...

77
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:56,529
why don't you just leave all that to me?

78
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:05,915
What are they doing here?

79
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,695
You don't know?

80
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:10,890
How would I?

81
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,848
I thought maybe your coming here
might have something to do with them.

82
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:19,352
Well, it don't.

83
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:23,355
They work for McCurdy.

84
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:27,692
He got his mind set on
buying every farm around here.

85
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:30,404
Folks who don't wanna sell...

86
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:34,532
they got some persuading
from those fellas over there.

87
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:38,369
If you don't know 'em,
you better stay away from them.

88
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:40,538
Those are damned men.

89
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:43,242
Those are godless men.

90
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,479
Is it your plan to come
to church tomorrow?

91
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,924
Is that an invitation, Pa?

92
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:08,227
Come back here!

93
00:16:19,721 --> 00:16:22,308
What is the reason you came home?

94
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:25,785
I didn't know I had to have a reason, Pa.

95
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:29,276
- If you want me to go, I'll go.
- I'm a forthright man.

96
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:31,549
You're an embarrassment to me.

97
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:35,186
Today in there, all I felt was shame.

98
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:40,328
But if you come back committed to God
to truly change your ways...

99
00:16:40,428 --> 00:16:43,738
then it's God's edict
that I forgive you and I do.

100
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:47,952
But in your mother's name
I cannot forget the past 10 years.

101
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,936
I cannot.

102
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:55,275
I know.

103
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:37,139
What in the world are you doing?

104
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,379
Ma always wanted us
to clear this field together.

105
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:44,260
You and me? No, she didn't.

106
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,842
As far as I can recall it's the only
thing she ever asked of us.

107
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:49,044
Not me.

108
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,431
Fine. I'll do it alone.

109
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,416
All right.

110
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:05,311
I would have lost heart...

111
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:08,689
if I had not believed that I would see...

112
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,516
the goodness of the Lord's light.

113
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:14,003
Be of good courage

114
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:16,855
and he shall give you strength.

115
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,229
Excuse me.

116
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,200
Gentleman.

117
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:37,717
We think we should bring in
our own hired guns.

118
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:40,980
Hired gun. To do what?

119
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,803
Start a war? Kill everyone?

120
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:45,651
Guns are not the answer.

121
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,953
Eversince Sheriff Hutton
ran off in the middle of night,

122
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:50,122
McCurdy and his boys been getting bolder.

123
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:53,490
Forced Tim Fuller off his land last week.
Now they're threatening Peterson.

124
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,280
They come on my land, they'll be looking
to the wrong end of my 10 gauge.

125
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,798
Wait, Daniel. Wait.

126
00:18:59,898 --> 00:19:04,068
I've wired the U.S. Marshall.
We will have the law on our side.

127
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:09,275
We're poor. When has the law
ever cared about folks like us?

128
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,361
No one's comin'.

129
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:16,331
Reverend.

130
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,106
Mary Alice.

131
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:45,876
Heard people say in church
you were back. Didn't believe it.

132
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,147
Needed to come out and see for myself.

133
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,719
I've been back a few days or so.

134
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,489
A few days and you haven't
come and seen me?

135
00:19:58,923 --> 00:20:01,292
I planned on it, I just...

136
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:07,069
You always were a terrible liar.

137
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:17,141
I waited for this day.

138
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:21,913
Thought about it.
Planned what I might say.

139
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,214
Now I don't know what to say.

140
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:35,627
You clearing all this by yourself?

141
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:37,763
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,467
Lot of work for one man.

143
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:45,871
Shovel right over there
if you care to help.

144
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:54,481
You look well.

145
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,526
So do you.

146
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:59,251
I swear you look the same
as the day I left.

147
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,344
Now there you go lying again.

148
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:05,057
I don't recall you being
so distrustful of folks, Mary Alice.

149
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:07,325
I'd never lie to you.

150
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:09,130
Well, I seem to...

151
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,932
recall you saying something about
coming back after the war.

152
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:25,744
Well, I better let you
get back to your work.

153
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:32,422
Maybe after I get settled we could
ride out to the bluffs like we used to.

154
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:35,754
That wouldn't be right.

155
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,126
- I'm married.
- Married?

156
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:43,560
Going on 8 years now.

157
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,697
I have a little boy, Charlie.

158
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,801
I thought you knew.

159
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:51,377
No.

160
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,120
No, I did not know that.

161
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:57,207
I waited for you.

162
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:00,077
But when the years passed
and there was no word...

163
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:03,198
Mary Alice, you do not
owe me an explanation.

164
00:22:10,888 --> 00:22:13,297
Who did you marry?

165
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,402
Tom Watson.

166
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,017
Tom's a good man.

167
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:27,306
Yes, he is.

168
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:31,842
Welcome home, John Henry.

169
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:48,795
Shit!

170
00:23:32,403 --> 00:23:36,400
All right. Bring 'em in, come on.

171
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:39,247
What the... Dan!

172
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,314
We was just coming to pay you a visit.

173
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,018
Appreciate you saving us a ride.

174
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:49,933
I've got nothing to say to you.

175
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:52,058
Well...

176
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,828
I got something to say to you.

177
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:28,426
That's enough.

178
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:32,480
You don't wanna kill him now, do ya?

179
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,083
Well, maybe I do. I...

180
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,602
I hadn't decided yet.

181
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,803
I'm taking him home.

182
00:24:40,903 --> 00:24:45,077
Hold on there now.
It ain't you who's doing the deciding.

183
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,728
May I take him home?

184
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:54,632
And what if I say no?
What you gonna do about it?

185
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:01,076
- Nothing.
- I'm sorry. I didn't quite hear that.

186
00:25:02,276 --> 00:25:04,362
Nothing.

187
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,501
All right, John Henry.

188
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:14,540
You have my permission to take him home.

189
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:42,800
Something's troubling you?

190
00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:54,748
Your mother and I kept asking ourselves...

191
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:56,698
asking God...

192
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,069
what we done wrong in your upbringing?

193
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:05,711
What did we do that filled you
with so much hate?

194
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:08,820
It weren't you.

195
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:13,656
John 8:32, remember?

196
00:26:13,756 --> 00:26:17,601
The truth will set you free.
God knows the truth.

197
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:22,839
All through the war I kept
asking myself, where was God?

198
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:26,477
Where was he at Shiloh and Seven Pines
when men lay dead and dying?

199
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:29,879
All good men, God-fearing men.

200
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:35,352
They just lay there, begging for some
small act of mercy on His behalf.

201
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:39,457
And then it finally dawned on me:

202
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:42,361
There ain't no God.

203
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:47,573
- There is no God?
- All I'm saying...

204
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,380
is that if there was ever a time
that man needed God

205
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,685
it was then and trust me, he wasn't there.

206
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:55,607
If you're expecting God
to save you, he ain't gonna.

207
00:26:55,707 --> 00:27:00,024
Most men came out of that war
wanting nothing more to do with killing,

208
00:27:00,124 --> 00:27:02,582
but not you... you went looking for it.

209
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:05,594
God is not responsible
for the life you choose.

210
00:27:05,694 --> 00:27:08,107
I did not choose it!

211
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,555
Get off my land.

212
00:27:44,855 --> 00:27:49,293
We just come to finish the conversation
that was interrupted, Dan.

213
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,004
Let us avoid unpleasantness.

214
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:04,530
Sir, I implore you to see reason.

215
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:08,935
If you take a fair grasp
of your situation,

216
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:12,595
you will arrive at the only reasonable
conclusion available to you.

217
00:28:12,695 --> 00:28:14,785
I'm stayin'.

218
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,799
Dirt and rock.

219
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,838
Exactly like the dirt and the rocks
you would find anywhere.

220
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:38,979
Yeah, but it's my dirt and my rock!

221
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:42,445
Yes, and a fine rock it is too.

222
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:44,882
Is it worth dying over?

223
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:49,413
You believe your wife would prefer
the dirt and the rock to you?

224
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,146
Will this keep her warm at night or...

225
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:56,820
put the food on the table?

226
00:28:57,733 --> 00:29:00,165
Is it gonna teach your children
right from wrong?

227
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:05,658
Comfort them in their beds
when they're frightened by the wind?

228
00:29:06,434 --> 00:29:09,476
You see, I do understand. I do understand.

229
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:15,113
I truly do understand the inequities
of your position, sir, but...

230
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,720
I believe when you weigh
the alternatives, you will see that...

231
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:30,894
There was no need for that.

232
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:33,729
We were talking.

233
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:38,002
It would appear the conversation's
over now, Dave.

234
00:29:38,102 --> 00:29:40,197
He was about to see reason.

235
00:29:40,297 --> 00:29:44,681
You actually ever kill anybody, Dave,
or you just talk 'em to death?

236
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:56,153
Anybody else have something to say?

237
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,586
Daniel Peterson...

238
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:11,835
is now safely in the embrace of our Lord.

239
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,813
But for us, here on earth,

240
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:18,456
a good man has been taken.

241
00:30:18,756 --> 00:30:21,815
A provider for his family...

242
00:30:21,915 --> 00:30:24,962
a friend to our community...

243
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:30,519
and in our despair, we rail against God.

244
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:33,259
Our faith is tested,

245
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,320
pushed to its very limits.

246
00:30:36,826 --> 00:30:40,430
But Almighty God has a purpose.

247
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,867
And senseless though it may seem to us,

248
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:48,373
it is not for mere mortal man
to question God's wisdom.

249
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:51,000
It is for us to persevere...

250
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,801
in a righteous way.

251
00:30:55,112 --> 00:30:56,472
- We gotta do something.
- Like what?

252
00:30:56,614 --> 00:30:59,451
- I don't know. We can't do nothing.
- What about getting a sheriff?

253
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:02,388
We tried that. Most men ain't got
the stomach for a fight like this.

254
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:06,158
We need a man who knows trouble,
a man who others fear.

255
00:31:06,258 --> 00:31:10,662
- You suppose he might come to our aid?
- Put that out of your head right now.

256
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:13,697
We could pay him.
Took a collection. We got $200.

257
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:16,400
He's done with that life.

258
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:20,238
I can't believe James
would let it come to this.

259
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:24,247
They killed Daniel Peterson.
I never thought they'd kill one of us.

260
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:28,212
- It's only gonna get worse.
- What makes you say that?

261
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:31,216
'Cause after the first one,
it gets easier.

262
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:38,557
You want something?
They heat up a good steak.

263
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:40,737
No, thank you.

264
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:45,964
Mrs. Peterson came in and sold me
her farm on the way out of town.

265
00:31:46,064 --> 00:31:49,034
Two other families wanna sell also.

266
00:31:49,134 --> 00:31:53,238
What I'm saying is... it looks
like a more aggressive approach

267
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:56,841
is having an effect on the locals.

268
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,745
Clyde murdered that man.

269
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:04,349
From what I heard,
Peterson was holding a shotgun.

270
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:08,186
I did not come here to be part
of a pack of murderers.

271
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,375
What the fuck did ya think
was gonna happen, Dave?

272
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:13,215
What?

273
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:16,394
You think I brought you here
to sweet-talk folk off their land?

274
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:18,261
Come on, Dave, please.

275
00:32:19,362 --> 00:32:24,569
I want Frank to take care of things
when it comes to the farms.

276
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:27,939
He seems to have to temperament required.

277
00:32:28,842 --> 00:32:32,472
- And me?
- I still want you here.

278
00:32:33,072 --> 00:32:38,803
I believe it's only a matter of time before
John Henry Clayton picks up his guns.

279
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,264
Hear we're riding
to the Chadwick farm tomorrow.

280
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:58,915
Why don't you just stand up on the bar
and announce our intention to all creation?

281
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:00,384
Sorry.

282
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:04,705
Guess my... enthusiasm
got the better of me.

283
00:33:21,693 --> 00:33:23,754
You planning to eat today?

284
00:33:24,094 --> 00:33:26,599
- Ain't hungry.
- Need to eat.

285
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:28,234
Told you, I ain't hungry.

286
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:31,322
You're trying to prove something out here.

287
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:36,342
- I ain't trying to prove nothing.
- Yes, you are.

288
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:39,877
You're working this land day in, day out.

289
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:43,882
You're so weary, time night comes,
you can barely move.

290
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,084
It's not for love of farming.

291
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:48,386
I know why it is.

292
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:53,490
You're trying to use this poor earth
to sweat out all your guilt and anger.

293
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,664
That's what it is, isn't it?

294
00:33:55,892 --> 00:34:00,314
No. Just because you don't
believe me, Pa, don't make it so.

295
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,967
I told you I'm doing this
because Ma wanted it.

296
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:07,024
What your mother wanted was
for you to come back from the war.

297
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:09,541
What about you, Pa?

298
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,668
Did you want me to come back?

299
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:15,052
Simple enough question.

300
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:17,973
Did it even bother you
that I didn't come back after the war?

301
00:34:18,616 --> 00:34:20,682
What are you talking about?

302
00:34:20,782 --> 00:34:22,862
I'm talking about the day
you turned your back on me,

303
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:25,189
the day my brother, William, died.

304
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:27,167
That's not true.

305
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:31,930
Ma saw it. Why the hell do you think she
wanted us to clear this field together?

306
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:36,268
- She tried to help us put things right.
- There was nothing to put right.

307
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,539
I remember it as if it was yesterday.

308
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,280
Mr. Jenkins came across
William and I down river.

309
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,728
Somehow he managed to drag us
out of there, get us up to his cabin.

310
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:51,617
He told his boy to go fetch you.

311
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:55,019
I was so cold and scared
I couldn't stop shaking.

312
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:58,027
When you arrived, I could hear
Mr. Jenkins trying to explain to you

313
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,075
that one of your sons had passed.

314
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:04,080
Before you could get the name out
you rushed in and you saw me.

315
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,032
And I'll never forget it.

316
00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:09,934
The look of disappointment on your face.

317
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:13,038
How could you think such a thing?

318
00:35:13,438 --> 00:35:15,706
Am I wrong?

319
00:35:15,806 --> 00:35:19,444
I didn't feel any disappointment,
far from it.

320
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:23,080
But I would be a liar

321
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,569
if I said to you I haven't felt it since.

322
00:35:27,217 --> 00:35:30,194
When word came back about your exploits,

323
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,513
I couldn't help but think that...

324
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:36,647
William might've made more of his life.

325
00:35:38,295 --> 00:35:40,032
Yeah.

326
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:30,500
Chadwick!

327
00:36:46,097 --> 00:36:48,600
It's an ambush!

328
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:44,689
- How the hell they know we was coming?
- Maybe they heard ya.

329
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:47,592
That don't explain why there's
so many guns waiting for us.

330
00:37:48,793 --> 00:37:52,764
Just heard Chadwick rode through the night
and came back with his kin from Landers.

331
00:37:52,864 --> 00:37:56,335
What would prompt him to do such a thing?

332
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:13,618
That one flapped his gum
so loud the other day

333
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:17,255
someone must've heard him
and warned 'em we was coming.

334
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:21,833
Dan Thompson was a good man,
died 'cause of that one's foolishness.

335
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,333
Let him bleed out.

336
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:49,521
How's the field coming?

337
00:38:49,921 --> 00:38:52,390
Almost all the trees are down.

338
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,027
Should start working the land pretty soon.

339
00:38:56,427 --> 00:39:01,701
So I take it with all the effort you're
putting in that you're planning on staying.

340
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:05,190
Not sure yet.

341
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,439
Why's that?

342
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:11,342
Don't exactly know where I fit it.

343
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:15,581
This is your home. If a man
can't fit in here, where can he?

344
00:39:23,354 --> 00:39:27,108
You ever thought about what it might've
been if you'd come back after the war?

345
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:35,216
So you never thought about it?

346
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:39,093
I ain't the same as the man
that left all them years back.

347
00:39:40,893 --> 00:39:43,774
I need to understand
why you didn't come back.

348
00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:45,910
I think I'm entitled to that much.

349
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,404
I'll say this, and I will say
no more on the subject.

350
00:39:57,504 --> 00:40:00,041
The thought of coming back to you...

351
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:03,827
was the only thing that got me
through that damn war.

352
00:40:04,127 --> 00:40:05,914
And when it was over,

353
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:08,098
I swear to you on my life,

354
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:10,769
I tried coming home.

355
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:15,173
I swore I was done with killing.

356
00:40:18,276 --> 00:40:20,756
She just wasn't done with me.

357
00:40:35,493 --> 00:40:37,862
You remember the day you left?

358
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:42,734
I gave you a red ribbon from my hair.

359
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:46,241
Told you to hold onto it till you
could bring it back to me.

360
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,408
Yes, I remember.

361
00:40:50,774 --> 00:40:52,736
You still have it?

362
00:40:53,136 --> 00:40:55,188
Does it matter?

363
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:57,882
I'd like to know.

364
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:11,129
You were right to marry Tom, Mary Alice.

365
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,465
You were right.

366
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:34,785
You wanted to see me?

367
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:38,629
I set you a simple task.

368
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,325
You wanna explain to me
how you took that task

369
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:44,761
and fucked it up in every conceivable way?

370
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:48,265
Well, I think everything's all right.

371
00:41:48,671 --> 00:41:50,891
Everything's all right.

372
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:53,371
You got two men dead,
one by your own hand,

373
00:41:53,471 --> 00:41:57,353
Chadwick's still on his land,
and I may not be as clever as you,

374
00:41:57,453 --> 00:42:01,541
but to my way of thinking
no way that adds up...

375
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:04,107
to all right.

376
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:07,985
If these things aren't dealt with quickly,
it could give the others ideas.

377
00:42:08,085 --> 00:42:13,317
The last thing we need is these muddle
heads thinking they can stand up to us.

378
00:42:27,388 --> 00:42:29,291
Regret marrying me?

379
00:42:30,941 --> 00:42:33,577
What kind of question is that?

380
00:42:34,077 --> 00:42:37,314
I seen John Henry here earlier today.

381
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:39,810
So?

382
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,920
So, I know how you felt about him.

383
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,985
That was a long time ago.

384
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,539
You're my husband, Tom.

385
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:04,910
I have no regrets.

386
00:44:40,737 --> 00:44:44,941
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- No, you ain't.

387
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:47,110
Eventually...

388
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:50,981
someone's gonna have the nerve
to stand up to you.

389
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:53,651
And when that day comes,

390
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:57,956
I want to be here to spit on your grave.

391
00:44:59,222 --> 00:45:03,402
Well, ma'am, feel free to do so.

392
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:09,408
Provided you can find your way
to the front of the line.

393
00:45:11,868 --> 00:45:14,737
20 pounds of seed, salt.

394
00:45:15,637 --> 00:45:19,041
- I'll settle the account.
- All right, Reverend.

395
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:23,099
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
You don't mind if I cut in here, do ya?

396
00:45:26,616 --> 00:45:31,355
Gimme a box of .44 skins
and a bottle of that tonic water.

397
00:45:31,555 --> 00:45:33,762
I got me a headache.

398
00:45:45,468 --> 00:45:47,504
You done?

399
00:45:48,772 --> 00:45:51,209
I look like I'm done?

400
00:45:55,844 --> 00:45:58,782
- Look what you made me do.
- I'll just clean that up.

401
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:01,168
No, no, it's all right.

402
00:46:01,268 --> 00:46:03,637
John Henry'll get it.

403
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:07,592
Won't you, John Henry?

404
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:21,091
- Yeah, get it all.
- Don't miss that spot over there.

405
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:24,224
And you got some on my boot.

406
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:47,832
You know, I don't care
for the way you're looking at me.

407
00:46:58,475 --> 00:47:01,445
You know what your problem is, John Henry?

408
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:04,768
You wanna act like a pilgrim, but...

409
00:47:04,868 --> 00:47:07,752
you still got the attitude of a killer.

410
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:18,829
I'll come back later, Mr. Parsons.

411
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,248
Where do ya think you're going?

412
00:47:23,348 --> 00:47:27,703
- Get out of my way.
- Ya see? There ya go, being rude again.

413
00:47:28,548 --> 00:47:30,435
No!

414
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:40,784
Not so smart, are you now, gunslinger?

415
00:47:47,274 --> 00:47:48,543
No!

416
00:47:55,732 --> 00:47:57,234
Somebody help us.

417
00:47:57,334 --> 00:47:59,537
Hey, hey, come on now. We're just funnin'.

418
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:15,987
Come on, Ned, hit him again.

419
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:24,460
Come on, John Henry, get up.

420
00:48:26,713 --> 00:48:28,850
John Henry, stay down.

421
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:03,198
Somebody help! Please!

422
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:06,154
- It's John Henry.
- Where you going?

423
00:49:06,454 --> 00:49:09,072
- He needs help.
- Well, others will help him.

424
00:49:09,172 --> 00:49:11,508
He's my friend.

425
00:49:11,808 --> 00:49:14,378
I said get back here, woman!

426
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:12,369
Welcome, gentleman.

427
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:15,606
Why don't you get
the gentlemen some drinks?

428
00:50:29,285 --> 00:50:32,889
You must be really thirsty
to be drinking in my place.

429
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:35,625
Let me be.

430
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:39,896
I heard about what happened on the street.

431
00:50:40,396 --> 00:50:44,534
Seems women get bolder
every year, don't they?

432
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:50,439
I believe I have a proposal
which might be of benefit to both of us.

433
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:55,278
Now the last thing I want is to interfere
in a man's marital affairs,

434
00:50:55,378 --> 00:50:59,214
but it appears that a change
in locale for you

435
00:50:59,314 --> 00:51:02,852
might be a solution for both of us.

436
00:51:07,055 --> 00:51:10,126
When you got a fox in the henhouse...

437
00:51:10,226 --> 00:51:12,828
only two things to do:

438
00:51:12,928 --> 00:51:16,366
Kill the fox or move the henhouse.

439
00:51:17,734 --> 00:51:19,942
Sell the land...

440
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:23,710
take the money, move away.

441
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,736
Far, far from here...

442
00:51:26,836 --> 00:51:29,848
and John Henry Clayton.

443
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,189
Done.

444
00:51:54,037 --> 00:51:56,440
Oh, my.

445
00:51:57,941 --> 00:52:00,007
How are you feeling?

446
00:52:00,107 --> 00:52:02,714
I wish people would stop asking me that.

447
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:07,661
It's only natural for friends to inquire.

448
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,554
Is that what we are, Dave?

449
00:52:11,654 --> 00:52:13,456
Friends?

450
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,161
I'd like to think so.

451
00:52:16,493 --> 00:52:18,896
Then answer me this...

452
00:52:20,229 --> 00:52:22,965
Do you think there's a place
for men like us to go,

453
00:52:23,065 --> 00:52:24,869
get away from the killing?

454
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:28,126
My experience would lead me to say no.

455
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:37,413
After the war I swore to myself
I'd never pick up a gun again.

456
00:52:37,813 --> 00:52:42,052
You can't go through something like that
and expect to be who you were.

457
00:52:42,352 --> 00:52:44,088
I suppose.

458
00:52:44,188 --> 00:52:46,892
May I ask,
what was the worst of it for you?

459
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:52,074
Without a doubt, Shiloh.

460
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:54,869
I would concur.

461
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:59,835
That first day at Owl Creek
I lost a lot of good friends.

462
00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:02,808
I was there at Owl Creek.

463
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:07,578
I do not recall seeing you there.

464
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,077
I was on the other side of the creek.

465
00:53:12,415 --> 00:53:14,252
Well.

466
00:53:16,286 --> 00:53:21,334
It would appear the past
is close to repeating itself with us.

467
00:53:21,691 --> 00:53:26,330
I feel you and I are headed
for an inevitable conclusion.

468
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:29,233
I got no fight with you, Dave.

469
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:34,348
Besides, if I was looking for trouble,
you'd already know it.

470
00:53:34,448 --> 00:53:35,906
How so?

471
00:53:36,406 --> 00:53:40,846
'Cause I'd have gone into town
and I'd have killed Frank and that big fella.

472
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:47,083
I do admire your restraint,
John Henry. I do.

473
00:53:47,383 --> 00:53:52,217
God knows I could not turn the other cheek
the way that you have. But...

474
00:53:52,317 --> 00:53:57,261
I also know if you kick a dog
long enough, he's gonna bite.

475
00:53:58,994 --> 00:54:01,825
So whatever it is that's given you

476
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:04,537
the strength to stay out of this,

477
00:54:04,637 --> 00:54:06,371
I pray you hold on to it.

478
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,942
I don't wanna see you
on the other side of that creek.

479
00:55:20,242 --> 00:55:23,780
The Lord is my light and my salvation.

480
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,781
Whom should I fear?

481
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:28,418
The Lord is the strength of my life.

482
00:55:28,818 --> 00:55:31,321
Of whom shall I be afraid?

483
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:36,226
Teach me thy way, oh, Lord.

484
00:55:36,326 --> 00:55:40,397
Lead me in a smooth path
because of my enemies.

485
00:55:40,597 --> 00:55:45,451
Do not deliver me to the will
of my adversaries.

486
00:55:45,869 --> 00:55:48,959
And such as breathe out...

487
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,494
violence.

488
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,603
I would have lost heart...

489
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:13,119
if I had not believed...

490
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:16,364
that I would see the goodness of the Lord

491
00:56:16,464 --> 00:56:18,852
in the land of the living.

492
00:56:19,302 --> 00:56:21,704
Wait for the Lord.

493
00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:24,754
Be of good courage...

494
00:56:24,954 --> 00:56:27,630
and he shall strengthen your heart.

495
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,981
Wait, I say, on the Lord.

496
00:56:32,081 --> 00:56:33,784
Amen.

497
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:43,359
- Hey there.
- Hey.

498
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:46,996
It's good to see you
finding your way back.

499
00:56:47,096 --> 00:56:49,499
- Thank you.
- We're leaving now!

500
00:56:50,299 --> 00:56:52,468
You stay away from her.

501
00:56:53,502 --> 00:56:57,875
- What are you saying, Tom?
- You don't think I see what's going on?

502
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:01,356
What's going on?

503
00:57:01,456 --> 00:57:05,231
- Tom.
- Stay out of this, Reverend.

504
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:07,651
Look at all of us?

505
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:12,480
He comes back here after all these years
and we welcome him home with...

506
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,392
smiles and open arms.

507
00:57:15,792 --> 00:57:17,660
Why?

508
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,864
I'll tell you why.

509
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:23,233
'Cause we're all afraid of him...

510
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:26,337
and the things he's done
and things he might do.

511
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:32,744
You think you can walk back in here
after all these years and just...

512
00:57:32,844 --> 00:57:35,378
pick up where you left off?

513
00:57:35,478 --> 00:57:38,816
I understand what you're thinking,
Tom, but you're wrong.

514
00:57:39,616 --> 00:57:41,951
Then tell me you don't love her.

515
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,553
Go on.

516
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:46,880
I want you to tell me in front of God,

517
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,344
your father, and everyone here
that you don't love her.

518
00:57:51,194 --> 00:57:53,263
Say it!

519
00:57:55,898 --> 00:57:58,335
Tell me you don't love her!

520
00:58:27,196 --> 00:58:29,332
You're wrong about him, Tom.

521
00:58:46,415 --> 00:58:48,685
Mr. McCurdy, I need to talk to you.

522
00:58:48,885 --> 00:58:52,324
The papers will be ready
for you to sign Tuesday.

523
00:58:52,424 --> 00:58:55,119
No, I've decided not to sell to you.

524
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,518
Something funny?

525
00:58:57,618 --> 00:59:01,672
I'm amused at how many times
my ears play tricks on me.

526
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:04,978
For a moment I thought I heard you
say you wish to extricate yourself

527
00:59:05,078 --> 00:59:08,705
from the agreement we made. Of course,
I know you couldn't've said that.

528
00:59:08,805 --> 00:59:11,450
I did say that. See, I been thinking my...

529
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,643
Shut up!

530
00:59:17,646 --> 00:59:20,026
Before you open your yap again,
I want you to consider

531
00:59:20,126 --> 00:59:22,818
the full ramifications
of your fucking actions.

532
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:26,368
We had a deal.

533
00:59:26,468 --> 00:59:30,626
- I didn't sign nothing.
- Words were spoke. Hands were shook.

534
00:59:30,726 --> 00:59:32,532
Well, I've had a change of heart.

535
00:59:32,632 --> 00:59:35,111
Come to realize that a new start
don't mean much if you...

536
00:59:35,211 --> 00:59:39,601
- you carrying old feelings with you.
- Well, that's very fucking deep, Tom.

537
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,736
Almost poetic.

538
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:45,808
And as I wipe a weepy tear
from my eye let me say this...

539
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:50,452
I'm not one who holds high principles,
but when a man shakes my hand...

540
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:52,581
and says he's gonna do something,

541
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:55,118
I expect him to follow through.

542
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:59,555
Now you be here before
the end of business Tuesday

543
00:59:59,655 --> 01:00:03,550
and sign those papers,
and bid this town a fond farewell

544
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:07,797
or suffer the fucking consequences.

545
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,162
Well, I ain't gonna just sit here
pretending that you and I

546
01:00:53,262 --> 01:00:56,118
have ever seen eye to eye on, well...

547
01:00:56,513 --> 01:00:58,949
pretty much anything.

548
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:03,086
Reason I ain't coming here
begging for forgiveness

549
01:01:03,186 --> 01:01:05,966
is because I don't think I deserve it.

550
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:10,989
But I would be mighty grateful if you could
make my purpose a little more clear to me.

551
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:43,058
Before I came home, I was just drifting.

552
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:47,696
Town to town.

553
01:01:47,796 --> 01:01:51,776
Ended up in a small place called
Norton, way over in Kansas.

554
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:57,665
Been riding hard,
went in the saloon for a drink.

555
01:01:58,065 --> 01:02:02,181
Two men come up on me looking
for a fight, so I gave it to 'em.

556
01:02:03,479 --> 01:02:06,781
Cut one of 'em up pretty bad,
outdrew on the other.

557
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:10,115
Told him to pick up his partner and get.

558
01:02:13,789 --> 01:02:16,859
All I had to do was leave that town.

559
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,050
But I didn't.

560
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,000
I waited.

561
01:02:23,684 --> 01:02:26,525
Daring 'em to come after me.

562
01:02:28,435 --> 01:02:30,916
And sure enough...

563
01:02:31,566 --> 01:02:35,944
when I walked outside those two
young men started firing on me.

564
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,925
Shot out my horse.
I drew my pistol. I fired back.

565
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,854
I killed them.

566
01:02:42,954 --> 01:02:45,366
Killed them both.

567
01:02:47,455 --> 01:02:49,993
In the middle of all of it
one of my shots went wide,

568
01:02:50,093 --> 01:02:52,661
straight through a storefront window.

569
01:02:55,464 --> 01:02:58,100
Woman came out screaming,

570
01:02:58,895 --> 01:03:01,284
covered in blood.

571
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:04,706
First I thought I'd shot her.

572
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:10,279
Then her husband come out...

573
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:15,951
carrying a little boy.

574
01:03:19,054 --> 01:03:21,924
I killed a boy, Pop.

575
01:03:23,374 --> 01:03:25,337
He looked to be the same age as William.

576
01:03:25,437 --> 01:03:29,665
He just lay there dead 'cause of what
I'd done. Just like William did.

577
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:33,435
William didn't die because of you.
You're not responsible for your brother...

578
01:03:33,535 --> 01:03:35,385
You told me not to take him
down to the river.

579
01:03:35,485 --> 01:03:39,476
I told both of you.
You were boys doing what boys do.

580
01:03:39,576 --> 01:03:43,578
It was an accident.
Tragic, but an accident.

581
01:03:43,678 --> 01:03:46,716
I often think about what my brother
would've grown up to be.

582
01:03:46,816 --> 01:03:49,382
Now I can't stop thinking about
what that little boy from Norton

583
01:03:49,484 --> 01:03:51,888
would've grown up to be.

584
01:03:53,687 --> 01:03:56,391
The only thing I know
that's true in my heart

585
01:03:56,491 --> 01:04:01,030
is that both of those boys would've
grown up to be a far cry better than me.

586
01:04:02,598 --> 01:04:06,435
Pa, I'm so sorry for what I've become.

587
01:04:25,253 --> 01:04:27,114
Charlie, Charlie.

588
01:04:27,214 --> 01:04:29,545
Go on, stay inside.

589
01:04:29,645 --> 01:04:32,362
Might I have a word with you, ma'am?

590
01:04:33,128 --> 01:04:35,832
We have no business
that I know of, Mr. McCurdy.

591
01:04:36,232 --> 01:04:38,049
That you know of.

592
01:04:38,149 --> 01:04:42,169
Your husband and I have spoken
about him selling his farm.

593
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:45,282
Well, I'd be surprised if my husband
entertained such an idea.

594
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,954
Well, ma'am, if that surprises you,

595
01:04:48,054 --> 01:04:52,065
you'll be dumbstruck to learn
he's agreed to the sale of the property.

596
01:04:53,115 --> 01:04:54,631
I don't believe you.

597
01:04:54,731 --> 01:04:56,920
Well, that's of little concern to me,

598
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,084
being as he's the title holder.

599
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,892
I want you off my land.

600
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:05,841
And you have every right to do so...

601
01:05:05,941 --> 01:05:07,964
for another...

602
01:05:08,064 --> 01:05:11,253
32 hours and 18 minutes.

603
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,602
And if we're still here?

604
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:16,837
Then I'd start looking for a black dress.

605
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:20,176
Let's go.

606
01:05:42,332 --> 01:05:44,401
McCurdy wants our land.

607
01:05:44,701 --> 01:05:47,402
You should be speaking with your husband.

608
01:05:47,502 --> 01:05:49,506
I'm speaking to you.

609
01:05:49,906 --> 01:05:54,484
Tom made a deal with McCurdy
and now he's changed his mind.

610
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,828
Mary Alice, you need to go home
and speak with your husband.

611
01:05:57,928 --> 01:06:00,469
He's gonna get himself killed.

612
01:06:00,569 --> 01:06:02,875
I don't want that for my boy.

613
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:07,484
You know why he's doing this.
To prove that he's as good as you are.

614
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:15,130
Mary Alice, I've seen this before
and it only ends one way.

615
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:16,815
You wanna save your family?

616
01:06:16,915 --> 01:06:20,353
You take what McCurdy's offering
and you move away. You understand me?

617
01:06:20,453 --> 01:06:22,741
You move away.

618
01:06:33,816 --> 01:06:35,985
Excuse me, Mr. McCurdy?

619
01:06:36,085 --> 01:06:38,588
Reverend's here. He wants a word with you.

620
01:06:38,888 --> 01:06:41,457
Did he say what it's about?

621
01:06:41,557 --> 01:06:45,233
- Tom Watson.
- I should've known. Show him in.

622
01:06:53,001 --> 01:06:55,811
You're to leave the Watsons alone, James.

623
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:58,371
You sure do have
a repetitive nature, Samuel.

624
01:06:58,471 --> 01:07:00,622
- I mean it.
- Mean what?

625
01:07:01,022 --> 01:07:03,213
What are you gonna do if I don't?

626
01:07:03,313 --> 01:07:06,964
Command the Lord to strike me
dead with a lightning bolt?

627
01:07:08,718 --> 01:07:11,086
We were friends.

628
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,855
I'm asking you...

629
01:07:13,955 --> 01:07:17,160
stop doing what you're doing
to Tom Watson.

630
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:21,353
Tom Watson shook my hand
and agreed to a deal.

631
01:07:21,453 --> 01:07:24,267
- He's not going to leave.
- He will.

632
01:07:24,367 --> 01:07:27,532
One way or another, he will.

633
01:08:18,854 --> 01:08:22,391
You did what? No!

634
01:08:23,701 --> 01:08:25,957
What are you...

635
01:08:27,052 --> 01:08:30,166
what are you shaking your head at?

636
01:08:31,867 --> 01:08:34,758
A damn fool, Frank.

637
01:08:35,369 --> 01:08:39,791
You did the one thing that will bring
John Henry Clayton into this.

638
01:08:55,457 --> 01:08:58,126
- Pa!
- In the back.

639
01:09:02,413 --> 01:09:05,418
- How is he?
- I don't know yet.

640
01:09:06,468 --> 01:09:08,270
Pa.

641
01:09:25,387 --> 01:09:27,190
John Henry.

642
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:31,541
How is he?

643
01:09:31,641 --> 01:09:36,632
Well, the blade missed any vital organs,
but he did lose a fair amount of blood.

644
01:09:36,732 --> 01:09:39,486
- We'll know more in the morning.
- I wanna see him.

645
01:09:39,586 --> 01:09:41,603
He's not conscious.

646
01:09:41,703 --> 01:09:44,200
I just wanna sit with him.

647
01:10:05,227 --> 01:10:07,996
Don't you even think
of leaving me, old man.

648
01:10:08,096 --> 01:10:10,131
Not now.

649
01:10:10,231 --> 01:10:13,069
Not after everything we've come through.

650
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,753
- I'll get the doc.
- No. Listen to me, son.

651
01:10:51,005 --> 01:10:53,643
I have to tell you something.

652
01:10:55,478 --> 01:10:57,546
I was wrong.

653
01:10:58,146 --> 01:11:00,518
I was wrong about you,

654
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:03,014
and I was wrong about me.

655
01:11:03,114 --> 01:11:07,239
That big fella,
I would've killed him if I could've.

656
01:11:07,339 --> 01:11:09,942
I would've killed all of them.

657
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:13,228
You and me...

658
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:16,149
we are the same blood.

659
01:11:24,306 --> 01:11:26,341
I'm filled with fear, John Henry.

660
01:11:26,441 --> 01:11:30,312
- You're gonna be fine, Pop.
- No, no, not for me.

661
01:11:31,112 --> 01:11:35,267
I'm fearful I'm gonna lose you.
I can see what's in your eyes.

662
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:45,294
- Then you know what I gotta do.
- You don't have to do anything.

663
01:11:45,394 --> 01:11:48,097
But we both know I will.

664
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:53,869
I'll get the doc.

665
01:11:53,969 --> 01:11:57,606
John Henry Clayton, you stop.

666
01:12:00,008 --> 01:12:02,556
John Henry, please.

667
01:12:08,517 --> 01:12:10,619
Please...

668
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,789
for me...

669
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:15,863
don't.

670
01:12:15,963 --> 01:12:18,226
This ain't gonna end, Pa,
till someone ends it.

671
01:12:18,326 --> 01:12:21,797
Not you. It doesn't have to be you.

672
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:25,334
It's time I did something right
in my life.

673
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:29,241
This is what I know how to do.

674
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:29,032
Mr. Parsons, is that a LeMat?

675
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:31,098
Yes, sir.

676
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,503
I... bought it off a fella
about a month ago.

677
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:40,442
She's a real beauty, ain't she?

678
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:43,679
9 shots in a 10 gauge shotgun barrel.

679
01:13:43,779 --> 01:13:48,172
And I can let you
have it for a fair price.

680
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:53,321
Or you can just borrow it.

681
01:15:12,734 --> 01:15:15,471
I suspect you're the one
they call Little Ned?

682
01:15:23,077 --> 01:15:24,757
That's right.

683
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:43,024
All you young 'uns who ain't willing to die
today, I suggest you unarm yourselves and get.

684
01:15:43,124 --> 01:15:45,668
Stay where you are, boys.

685
01:15:56,243 --> 01:15:58,747
Goddamn you.

686
01:17:04,548 --> 01:17:06,566
Fuck!

687
01:18:13,882 --> 01:18:16,209
Mouth getting dry, Frank?

688
01:18:17,018 --> 01:18:19,856
You offering to buy me a drink?

689
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:13,174
John Henry.

690
01:19:23,518 --> 01:19:25,869
Whatever happens next,

691
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:30,508
I want you to know I did not sanction
that cowardly act against your father.

692
01:19:30,608 --> 01:19:32,325
Personally, I found their actions damnable

693
01:19:32,425 --> 01:19:35,131
and deserving of the fate
you brought upon them.

694
01:19:35,697 --> 01:19:37,798
Then you'll be leaving?

695
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:40,134
Can't do that.

696
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:43,499
No one hires a gunman
who runs from trouble.

697
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:48,143
You don't have to run, Dave. You can walk.

698
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:54,550
The terms of my employment
would not allow me to do that.

699
01:20:15,203 --> 01:20:18,697
This here LeMat's mighty heavy.
Puts me at a disadvantage.

700
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:22,160
What would you suggest?

701
01:20:22,931 --> 01:20:27,235
Would you be kind enough to let me go
back inside and retrieve myself a Colt?

702
01:20:40,194 --> 01:20:42,231
Thank you.

703
01:22:17,691 --> 01:22:20,328
My friend, you are no longer employed.

704
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:34,141
It would appear you are correct.

705
01:22:43,684 --> 01:22:45,687
It's been a pleasure knowing you, Dave.

706
01:23:23,107 --> 01:23:24,509
I'm all right, Pa.

707
01:23:26,794 --> 01:23:30,246
It's not gonna take long for word to
get out on what happened here today.

708
01:23:30,346 --> 01:23:33,135
Men from far and wide are gonna come looking
for me to make a name for themselves.

709
01:23:33,235 --> 01:23:35,468
Don't go away.

710
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:37,977
I can't finish the field on my own.

711
01:23:38,077 --> 01:23:41,042
The field's finished, Pa. I seeded it.

712
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:43,711
It'll take care of itself.

713
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,313
I gotta go.

714
01:23:46,413 --> 01:23:49,883
You're not going for
another 10 years, are you?

715
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:54,055
No, I promise. See you soon, Pa.

716
01:24:15,109 --> 01:24:17,579
<i>Little is known of him after that.</i>

717
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,947
<i>Some say he drifted down to Coffeeville</i>

718
01:24:20,047 --> 01:24:23,484
<i>where he was involved
in another altercation</i>

719
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:25,420
<i>a few years later.</i>

720
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,422
<i>But those accusations were never proven.</i>

721
01:24:29,922 --> 01:24:33,428
<i>The common view was he moved
westward under a different name,</i>

722
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:37,466
<i>where he lived a life of quiet isolation.</i>

723
01:24:42,365 --> 01:24:46,189
<i>What is known is that when
Mary Alice died a few years later,</i>

724
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:48,943
<i>he did not attend her funeral.</i>

725
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:52,714
<i>However, many say the following day,</i>

726
01:24:52,814 --> 01:24:57,285
<i>a faded red ribbon was found
attached to her headstone.</i>

727
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:10,278
<i>Others in Fowler recounted stories
of seeing him throughout the years</i>

728
01:25:10,378 --> 01:25:12,834
<i>up until his father's death,</i>

729
01:25:12,934 --> 01:25:17,005
<i>at which time he came no more.</i>
