1
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:19,824
Let go of me!

2
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:23,769
Let go of me!

3
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:26,901
Edward!

4
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:31,309
Oh, my God!

5
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,342
Edward!

6
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:12,334
Edward.

7
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:13,904
Go back!

8
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:16,106
Edward, no!

9
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:22,646
You leave me no choice. Ruddock.

10
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:30,116
- Edward!
- Don't do it!

11
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:32,853
Edward! Please, control yourself.

12
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:36,958
Down here, on the bed!

13
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:39,455
Stop!

14
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:45,069
Get them.

15
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:32,910
- I'm asking you.
- I don't know.

16
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,749
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

17
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:05,306
I don't know what you and him are up to,
but you've got to get him out of here.

18
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:07,679
- You're being paid.
- And paid well.

19
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:10,981
Barely well enough.
If the police come, what's the answer?

20
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,679
You've nothing to fear, Hackett.

21
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:16,589
You're running a lodging house
for drunken thieves and whores.

22
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:19,183
It's that filthy stench.
What's he doing in there?

23
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,628
- That's what I want to know.
- That's enough! About your business!

24
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:25,063
Anyway, he'll be gone soon enough.

25
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,967
The sooner the better, if you ask me.

26
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,291
- It's not ready to be seen as yet.
- But it will be by tonight?

27
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:03,528
Yes. Have you brought the money?

28
00:08:07,907 --> 00:08:09,397
- Gold?
- Guineas.

29
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:12,607
But not till your work is done.

30
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:16,479
When it is, you can take this
back to Africa with you...

31
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,909
on the same boat that brought you here.

32
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:21,042
You'll be a rich man, N'Galo.

33
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:24,615
That's what you want.

34
00:08:27,693 --> 00:08:29,558
Do you think it will work?

35
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:32,687
When he takes this,
he will sleep as if dead.

36
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,725
Look...

37
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,162
even if we do get Sir Edward here...

38
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,399
can he really help him?

39
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,301
I have seen what witchcraft can do.
Believe me, Norton.

40
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:47,343
You have seen what another man
of my powers has done already.

41
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:48,911
Have you not?

42
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:50,337
Yes.

43
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:53,915
We have knowledge of things
you know nothing of.

44
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:19,700
I've been thinking it over, Julian.

45
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,370
And I've decided that I want to
get married at sea on an open boat.

46
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,373
Yes.

47
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,315
In a brilliant scarlet dress to amuse
all the sailors and shock my father.

48
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:34,184
What? I'm sorry Elizabeth.
I was miles away.

49
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:35,788
So I noticed.

50
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:39,325
Back in Africa?

51
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:41,252
Why do you think that?

52
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:43,489
I would have thought it was obvious.

53
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:46,362
Since you've been home
you're a totally different person.

54
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:48,901
- No, that's nonsense.
- No, it isn't.

55
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:51,036
Look at you.

56
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:53,573
Always brooding, heavy-spirited.

57
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:59,002
Half the time you seem to forget
you're with me and we're going to get...

58
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:01,772
Elizabeth, dear, I am sorry, truly.

59
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,416
What happened out there?

60
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:07,609
What's on your mind all the time?
Please tell me.

61
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:10,416
No. It's not worth your worrying about.

62
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,991
When we're married, Julian,
I want to share your life.

63
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:22,526
Don't let's start out with secrets, please.
Let me start sharing now.

64
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:26,930
I may have things on my mind,
but that doesn't mean that I've changed.

65
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:29,339
Then prove it.

66
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:39,250
I didn't really mean that.

67
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:42,681
I meant...

68
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:46,879
I'd like to see you smiling
the way you used to smile.

69
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:49,084
There!

70
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:56,126
Yes, it's your usual
good report, Trench.

71
00:10:56,834 --> 00:11:01,100
- Thorough and precise.
- I'm more than pleased to be back.

72
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:05,265
- Africa is a heathen place, and no mistake.
- Yes.

73
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:07,640
Thank you.

74
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,073
Yes, we've had
a distasteful time of it here, too.

75
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:15,884
Properly handled, your African plantation
could keep you living well...

76
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:17,918
to the end of your God-given days.

77
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,649
You and your brother.
We mustn't forget Sir Edward, must we?

78
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:24,783
Sir Edward wouldn't eat
any of his dinner, sir.

79
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:28,121
Thank you, Ruddock, I'll try later.

80
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,795
How is Sir Edward now?

81
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,531
How did you expect him to be? Better?

82
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,327
I had hoped more normal.

83
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:38,404
Yes, he did seem to be more normal...

84
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,135
so we took off the chains.

85
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,107
But the madness only overcame him again.

86
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:49,539
He tried to break away, to escape.

87
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,983
Ever since then
he seems to have grown steadily worse.

88
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,645
Every man wants to be free.

89
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,883
How can he be free,
looking the way he does?

90
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:01,523
Don't you understand
his mind is going, too?

91
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:05,186
Sometimes that sickness strikes him
with such ferocity...

92
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:08,930
he's as dangerous as an insane beast.

93
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:11,267
Perhaps an asylum?

94
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:13,128
No.

95
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:15,704
We mustn't even think about that.

96
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:20,039
I couldn't bear the thought of my brother
screaming his life away...

97
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:24,411
in Bedlam with the rest
of those unfortunate creatures.

98
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,045
And surgery is out of the question?

99
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:33,019
Do you think those carrion doctors
could put his face together again?

100
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:36,952
Do you think they could even
lay hands on him...

101
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:40,626
without wanting to experiment? No.

102
00:12:41,632 --> 00:12:43,361
I'd like to see him.

103
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:46,232
I don't allow anyone
to see him but myself.

104
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,965
- He's much too dangerous.
- I'm not afraid.

105
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:52,475
He seemed so pleased
to see me the last time.

106
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,807
Yes, he did seem to be better
for a while after you saw him.

107
00:12:58,048 --> 00:13:00,016
Very well, you may go up.

108
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:07,150
But please,
don't let him see you're shocked...

109
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:09,757
by how much worse he has become.

110
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,653
And don't get too close.

111
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:16,290
Remember, if the madness
comes over him again...

112
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:19,561
your only protection
are the chains on his feet.

113
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:22,259
- Thank you, I'll remember.
- Ruddock.

114
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:25,469
Take Mr. Trench to see Sir Edward.

115
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:47,122
- I'd keep my distance, sir.
- It'll be all right, Ruddock.

116
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,261
Sir Edward?

117
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,361
Sir Edward. It's me, Trench.

118
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,664
There isn't much time.

119
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,801
I just want you to know
that I've come back from Africa.

120
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,149
- Have you done what I asked?
- Yes.

121
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,809
When will it be?

122
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,947
In two days. It'll be ready.

123
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,558
You will be well rewarded.
Unless you fail.

124
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:26,298
I must get out of here, Trench.
I'm counting on you. Before it's too late.

125
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:52,578
It's as I feared. You've upset him.

126
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:56,690
I'm afraid I can't allow anyone
to see him again ever.

127
00:14:56,793 --> 00:14:58,124
Good night.

128
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:14,401
Look!

129
00:15:16,512 --> 00:15:17,706
What happened?

130
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,907
Body snatchers, Master Julian.

131
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:21,778
They got away.

132
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:25,215
The doctors still require
their warm guinea pigs.

133
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:28,789
You're not shocked?

134
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:33,551
It's better that they practice their
barbarities on the dead than on the living.

135
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:36,859
- They pay a handsome price, I suppose.
- Of course.

136
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:40,428
And for some of our people,
that kind of money is the difference...

137
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:43,765
- between a full belly and an empty one.
- You're not shocked?

138
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:47,430
I can see how important
it is for the poor souls.

139
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:50,176
Better than a good mark in heaven.

140
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:53,744
It is for God to judge, Parson,
and not you.

141
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:57,539
It's horrifying, Julian.

142
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:00,552
Far worse things
are known to man, Elizabeth.

143
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:06,292
I'm going to put it all out of my mind.
The only thing to think about is us.

144
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,995
- Are we still getting married soon?
- Sooner.

145
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:13,495
Because Father may succeed
in driving me off to Italy, away from you.

146
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:17,069
- But I thought we had his blessing.
- That was before.

147
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,193
Before?

148
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:22,638
Before you returned
from the dark continent.

149
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:25,232
Before you dismissed
most of the servants.

150
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:27,703
Before the town started to talk.

151
00:16:28,514 --> 00:16:31,449
You mean they're talking about me?
About the house?

152
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:35,450
Don't you see what a hermit
you're becoming? Of course they talk.

153
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:39,914
Wild tales of demons
and ghosties with rattling chains.

154
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,158
But you don't believe
any of that nonsense, do you?

155
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:46,494
There's nothing to believe, is there?

156
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:51,161
- What do you think?
- I think they're all madmen, fools.

157
00:16:51,601 --> 00:16:52,659
Good.

158
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,609
For the master.

159
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:17,301
- From Mistress Elizabeth, Master.
- Thank you, Ruddock.

160
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,397
Have you taken up
Sir Edward's dinner yet?

161
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:21,942
No, sir, I'll take it up right away.

162
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:32,552
"Dearest Julian, I am no longer able to fight
my father's wishes to send me to Italy."

163
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,315
"He is disturbed
by your strange behavior..."

164
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:38,085
"and wants to be sure
that I do not make a mistake."

165
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:41,719
"You must know that it is not my wish
to leave you and end our betrothal."

166
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:44,287
Master Julian!

167
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:49,034
Sir! It's Sir Edward!

168
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:51,169
What is it, Ruddock?

169
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:55,268
You'd better come, Sir.

170
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:28,968
Edward, why did they have to take you?

171
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,840
Can your soul ever forgive mine?

172
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:36,077
Ruddock...

173
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:39,449
bring Trench to me.
And no one else is to know.

174
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:41,243
Very well, Sir.

175
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:00,597
There's Trench now.

176
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:22,679
- My brother Edward has died.
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

177
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:24,983
There's no need for sorrow.

178
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:28,153
In his case oblivion
was a merciful release.

179
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,030
- When is he going to be buried?
- As soon as you've found another body.

180
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:39,030
I don't understand.

181
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:42,970
It's been so long since there was
a funeral in this family, Trench.

182
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:44,701
You've forgotten.

183
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:48,370
The Markhams go to their grave
with a sense of occasion.

184
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:53,918
The villagers must pay their respects.
We must lie in state for the world to see.

185
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:58,752
But we wouldn't want the world to see
what Edward was really like.

186
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,753
So you want another body
for the villagers to look at?

187
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:05,692
Correct. Edward
is already in his coffin.

188
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:10,464
Once the town has gaped at the proxy
corpse, then we can bury the real one.

189
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,265
I won't be involved.

190
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:16,273
You've been involved with this family
most of your life, Trench.

191
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,310
Do you realize the penalty
for body snatching is hanging?

192
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:21,709
- It's the same penalty as for forgery.
- What?

193
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:23,212
I said forgery.

194
00:22:23,915 --> 00:22:26,110
With these papers you have managed...

195
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:30,712
to extract 1,000 guineas
from our plantations, is that not so?

196
00:22:30,822 --> 00:22:32,949
I'm a lawyer, not a businessman.

197
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,287
You're a forger and an embezzler...

198
00:22:36,762 --> 00:22:39,287
and now you're going to become
a body snatcher.

199
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:42,127
Not willingly, Julian.

200
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,700
They say the deeper you get,
the easier it becomes.

201
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:51,174
- How long have you known about this?
- I've suspected for some time.

202
00:22:51,976 --> 00:22:53,375
But now I know.

203
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:56,345
What are you going to do?

204
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,806
I'm going to give you
another 1,000 guineas...

205
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,641
or turn you over to the authorities.

206
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:07,819
Very well, Sir Julian.

207
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:11,450
Your brother shall have the traditional,
dignified funeral.

208
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,188
Just give me enough time
to find a body for him...

209
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:16,388
that won't disgrace your noble line.

210
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,567
Will you join me in a brandy?

211
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:23,967
Thank you.

212
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,725
Have you brought the money?

213
00:23:46,494 --> 00:23:48,052
- Well?
- I was sent for.

214
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:49,594
- It happened?
- Yes.

215
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,699
When do we let ourselves into the house
to rescue Sir Edward?

216
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,232
We don't. Not now.

217
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:57,597
Why not?

218
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,031
Because, my dear Mark,
Sir Edward is already nailed in a coffin.

219
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:03,232
What?

220
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:06,906
And securely locked behind a door
to which we do not have a key.

221
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,445
I don't understand.

222
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,675
There are, however,
still opportunities for making money.

223
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,808
How?

224
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,914
Julian doesn't want anyone to see
his brother looking the way he does now.

225
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,547
He wants another body
to show the townspeople.

226
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,254
That's madness!

227
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,296
Madness or not, we are going to
provide him with another body.

228
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:27,999
We haven't got to do anything.
At least, I haven't.

229
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,694
My God, Trench, have you forgotten
Sir Edward alive in that coffin?

230
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,498
Control yourself, Mark.

231
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,506
I've already told you,
there's nothing we can do about that.

232
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,907
Julian is offering 1,000 guineas
for a dead body.

233
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,306
And that's what we're going to do,
give him one.

234
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,981
So how do we get it? Answer me that.

235
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:56,359
N'Galo, I feel, can help us further.

236
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:17,337
- Good. You know what to do?
- Aye, Doctor.

237
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:21,108
They put it in, we take it out.
As fast as that.

238
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:23,242
What about the last one you promised me?

239
00:25:23,352 --> 00:25:27,481
We had a bit of trouble, but don't
worry yourself, this one will be warmer.

240
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,048
I've come to pay you.

241
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:10,555
Inside.

242
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:21,495
Yes. Here we are.

243
00:26:22,107 --> 00:26:23,369
Well, go on.

244
00:26:24,443 --> 00:26:25,910
Help yourself.

245
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:29,571
I think you'll find it's all there.

246
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,635
I'll get Mr. Hackett. I will.

247
00:27:38,546 --> 00:27:40,810
- Mr. Hackett.
- I'm afraid he's busy.

248
00:27:40,915 --> 00:27:43,712
- Not too busy to see me, love.
- Good evening, madam.

249
00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:46,877
- Yes?
- Mr. Hackett, I'm afraid, is not too well.

250
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:51,014
- What is it this time?
- I fear he's had a little too much to drink.

251
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:52,987
I'm not surprised.

252
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,420
But I can assure you
that he'll be up presently.

253
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:33,088
Ruddock, tell your master
that Samuel Trench wishes to see him.

254
00:28:33,198 --> 00:28:35,860
On a matter of the greatest importance.

255
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:47,940
This is Mark Norton.

256
00:28:48,045 --> 00:28:52,141
- I told you to do it alone.
- I couldn't do it alone.

257
00:28:55,452 --> 00:28:58,148
Hadn't you better get your prize inside?

258
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,893
Yes. Ruddock.

259
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:35,317
Since our return from Africa,
as you know...

260
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:38,387
my brother has been forced
to live in seclusion...

261
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:40,892
the victim of a tropical disease.

262
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:45,525
However, in his will, he has not
forgotten the village of his youth.

263
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,560
There is a substantial donation
to the church...

264
00:29:50,237 --> 00:29:52,569
and generous bequest to the poor.

265
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,312
Our Father which art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

266
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:16,394
- 1,000 guineas and this.
- Blood money.

267
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:18,827
Hardly. The man was already dead.

268
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:22,833
- Tell me, what really did happen in Africa?
- What do you mean?

269
00:30:23,035 --> 00:30:26,265
- Nothing. Only it is curious, isn't it?
- What is?

270
00:30:26,437 --> 00:30:31,397
That no one's ever heard what Sir Edward
did to deserve such a terrible punishment.

271
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:34,042
Retribution.

272
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:37,747
That's just what I've come
to think it was.

273
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:40,847
- Retribution.
- God's vengeance.

274
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:44,955
You were never impressed
by the Christian myths before.

275
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,288
Sin and retribution.

276
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:51,624
We sinned out there
in Africa, all right.

277
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:55,625
Plundering their land,
and we're still stealing their wealth.

278
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:58,357
Though they're too innocent to know it.

279
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:01,767
Yes, Edward's fate
can only be our punishment...

280
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:04,738
our kind of retribution.

281
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:07,769
You're only making me more curious.

282
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,453
'...of whom may we seek
for succour, but of thee, O Lord...

283
00:33:06,556 --> 00:33:09,286
'...who for our sins
art justly displeased?

284
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:13,592
'Yet, O Lord God most holy,
O Lord most mighty...

285
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:16,323
'...O holy and most merciful Saviour...

286
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:18,197
'...deliver us not into...'

287
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,565
Why did you never tell me?
I would have understood.

288
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:25,270
I couldn't be sure, Elizabeth.
I didn't know how to tell you.

289
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:28,035
Sending that letter to you.

290
00:33:28,377 --> 00:33:31,778
I'm so sorry. So very sorry.

291
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,039
You're my last chance, Elizabeth,
for some peace, some happiness.

292
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:40,380
- You will stay, you will marry me?
- Of course I will, darling.

293
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:46,122
He has found some peace at last,
as he never could have on earth.

294
00:33:46,227 --> 00:33:48,320
'...dear brother here departed...

295
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:51,364
'...we therefore commit
his body to the ground...

00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:53,593
'...earth to earth...

'...dust to dust.

'...in sure and certain hope
of Resurrection...'

300
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:04,101
- Poor Edward Markham.
- We'll open the house again.

301
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,610
It'll be like it once was.

302
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:10,281
We'll let the sun stream
in on a new life.

303
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:53,821
Help! Murder!

304
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,095
- Murder!
- Right, hold him.

305
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:20,013
Move yourself.

306
00:35:20,649 --> 00:35:21,911
Come on.

307
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:31,350
Easy.

308
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:39,493
Come on.

309
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:41,332
Giddy-up now!

310
00:36:00,453 --> 00:36:02,387
Move yourself, lads. Come on.

311
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:08,553
I thought you were
never going to get here.

312
00:36:08,661 --> 00:36:12,688
These things take time and caution,
Doctor, as I'm sure you realize.

313
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:13,823
Yes.

314
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,134
- What have you got for me this time?
- Male. Just buried.

315
00:36:20,006 --> 00:36:24,032
His name and where he comes from
is my business. You know that, too.

316
00:36:24,543 --> 00:36:27,910
By the way, we've got something
extra special for you tonight.

317
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:31,380
- What do you mean?
- All right, bring it in. On the table.

318
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:47,587
Slightly damaged, I'm afraid.

319
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:52,032
We couldn't take one without the other,
if you see what I mean.

320
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:55,332
- You murdered him.
- Well, the law might call it that.

321
00:36:55,605 --> 00:36:58,165
We ought to call it a lucky accident.

322
00:36:58,808 --> 00:37:02,642
Lucky for you, because you've got
twice the stuff for your knives and needles.

323
00:37:02,745 --> 00:37:06,340
Lucky for me and the boys
in the usual way.

324
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:11,618
Of course, you know...

325
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:15,582
you'd better never ever
so much as whisper about this, don't you?

326
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:16,847
Weller!

327
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:21,294
You would do well to realize
that you are in this as deeply as I am.

328
00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:22,863
Remember that.

329
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,365
It's all in the course
of science, isn't it?

330
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:03,282
Why don't we spend the honeymoon
in Africa?

331
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:04,417
No.

332
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:09,891
A long time ago, when you first met me,
you said you loved the land out there.

333
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:14,259
But not any more, Elizabeth.
I never want to go back there again.

334
00:39:15,404 --> 00:39:17,929
- Why?
- I've seen too much...

335
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:20,471
of what Africa can mean...

336
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,710
and what we have come to mean to Africa.

337
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,046
In fact, I...

338
00:39:26,915 --> 00:39:27,973
Yes?

339
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:33,112
I've been thinking of abandoning
everything out there before it's too late.

340
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,021
What would that mean?

341
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:41,093
Well, it would mean that we'd still be
Sir Julian and Lady Elizabeth...

342
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:44,622
but there wouldn't be anything
to go with the title.

343
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,067
I see.

344
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,594
For years now, this family has been
nothing but an empty facade.

345
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:56,298
- And yet, still you'd abandon Africa?
- More than ever.

346
00:39:57,111 --> 00:40:00,205
That's the only way we can find peace.

347
00:40:06,753 --> 00:40:09,051
You'll make a splendid host, Doctor.

348
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:12,655
And I feel very much at home here.

349
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:16,956
- I'm obliged to you.
- And I'm obliged to you, Doctor.

350
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:20,756
Particularly as you're going to
give me shelter.

351
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:24,229
Are you suggesting that I should
hide you here in this house?

352
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:25,564
Why should I?

353
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:29,970
Your body snatchers seem to have
thrown you on the murder trail last night.

354
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:33,439
Would you like anyone
to know about that?

355
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:37,774
Anyway, the penalty for grave robbing
is the noose, isn't it?

356
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:41,811
And happily or not,
my body's alive enough to tell the tale.

357
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,650
Just who are you?

358
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:46,990
- Don't you know whose grave they robbed?
- I do not.

359
00:40:47,224 --> 00:40:49,954
Empty graves eventually
tell their story.

360
00:40:50,061 --> 00:40:52,894
You're mistaken.
They show no signs of having been opened.

361
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:56,932
So, you're the only one
who knows of my resurrection.

362
00:40:57,067 --> 00:41:00,696
I couldn't have wished for better.
I'm in your good care now, Doctor.

363
00:41:00,804 --> 00:41:03,170
Indeed. And for how long?

364
00:41:03,606 --> 00:41:05,403
As long as need be.

365
00:41:13,048 --> 00:41:14,675
I must stay hidden.

366
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:18,782
You're going to keep me
healthy as well...

367
00:41:18,887 --> 00:41:22,789
until I've paid back
some very urgent debts.

368
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:31,756
Duke!

369
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:38,596
What have you found, Duke?

370
00:41:51,118 --> 00:41:52,551
Come on, Duke!

371
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,821
The servants have returned.

372
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,696
Now that you've safely taken charge
of your remarkable cadaver...

373
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:11,065
What shall I say to them about you?

374
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,597
Tell them...

375
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:15,071
I'm a relative, badly burned abroad...

376
00:42:15,174 --> 00:42:18,233
who prefers not to frighten people
with his scars.

377
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,769
Yes, I suppose that's reasonable.

378
00:42:21,813 --> 00:42:25,374
- You really are a very fortunate man.
- Why do you say that?

379
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,680
You're looking at someone who must be
quite unique, even in your experience.

380
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:32,219
A man turned inside out
through sorcery...

381
00:42:32,323 --> 00:42:35,156
by a handful of powders
and obscure drugs.

382
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:38,628
My mind's been unhinged,
my face destroyed.

383
00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:42,399
I've been killed and then brought
miraculously back to life.

384
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:45,428
I am a very remarkable creature, Doctor.

385
00:42:46,537 --> 00:42:49,529
And you are only concerned
with what the servants will think.

386
00:42:49,673 --> 00:42:52,938
- One has to observe the conventions.
- Be done with it, and get out!

387
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,475
Lock me in here if you wish,
and don't worry about the servants.

388
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:58,876
I'll only do my prowling by night.

389
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:01,038
Poor fellow. I wonder who he was?

390
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:03,132
We'll find out.

391
00:44:03,243 --> 00:44:07,542
This is Master Julian Kemp, Doctor.
He found the body.

392
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,445
- My dog did, actually.
- You uncovered a mystery, Master Kemp.

393
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,753
Whoever he is, he wasn't drowned.

394
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:19,791
He died, it seems,
from natural causes...

395
00:44:19,892 --> 00:44:22,827
and either fell
or was pushed into the water.

396
00:44:51,254 --> 00:44:52,551
Thank you.

397
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,418
Thank you, Sally.

398
00:45:05,601 --> 00:45:07,193
A beautiful girl.

399
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:11,697
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- Merely a comment.

400
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:16,771
Perhaps you'd be good enough to tell me
how long you propose to stay here?

401
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:20,178
I've told you, Doctor.
Until I settle my debts.

402
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:23,176
I hope I'm not interfering
with your work.

403
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:26,686
In fact, I intend
to help you financially.

404
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:29,923
It must be just awful
to have your face so badly burned...

405
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:32,959
that you can't let it be seen.
I'm sorry for him.

406
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:36,326
- He sounds such a gentleman.
- Don't let your sympathy go too far.

407
00:45:36,431 --> 00:45:38,626
- Mrs. Hopkins!
- You needn't Mrs. Hopkins me.

408
00:45:38,733 --> 00:45:41,361
I know your dealings with the gentry,
Sally Baxter.

409
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:44,369
It's not faces you're interested in,
is it girl?

410
00:45:45,439 --> 00:45:49,239
Well, Mark, everything's ready
exactly the way you asked for it.

411
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:52,744
A draft on the American Bank,
and the balance in gold.

412
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,290
Aren't you going to say thank you?

413
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:12,693
Thank you, Trench, for your worthless
promises and the blood on my hands.

414
00:46:12,798 --> 00:46:14,766
You needed money. I helped you get it.

415
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:17,734
You didn't mention that getting it
meant murder!

416
00:46:17,837 --> 00:46:20,431
You really are frightened, aren't you?

417
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,264
Yes.

418
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:27,744
My dear Mark, if Hackett's body is found,
there's nothing on it to prove his identity.

419
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,110
And what about Sir Edward? Buried alive.

420
00:46:31,316 --> 00:46:33,147
An unfortunate accident.

421
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:37,415
I've forgotten the entire affair and
I suggest the sooner you do, the better.

422
00:46:38,088 --> 00:46:39,817
I'm leaving England.

423
00:46:40,858 --> 00:46:43,918
I wish to God
I'd never set eyes on you, Trench.

424
00:46:44,194 --> 00:46:46,594
I pray to God I never shall again.

425
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,100
I think it's time for tea, Graves.
Don't you?

426
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,559
All right. To Dover.

427
00:48:26,825 --> 00:48:28,257
Hey there, driver!

428
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:36,360
No need for knives, highwayman.

429
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:38,435
Not if you tell me
where the witch doctor is.

430
00:48:38,536 --> 00:48:40,799
- Sir Edward.
- Where is he?

431
00:48:40,971 --> 00:48:43,963
- I don't know.
- Too late for lies now.

432
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:47,610
- I swear, I don't know.
- Then you are useless to me.

433
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:03,547
Good evening, Madam.

434
00:50:09,455 --> 00:50:11,946
It's so nice to see
the house open again.

435
00:50:12,058 --> 00:50:13,719
Yes, a change.

436
00:51:35,136 --> 00:51:36,660
Very interesting.

437
00:51:43,344 --> 00:51:46,177
- Sir Julian.
- I'm so pleased you could come.

438
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:47,641
Charmed.

439
00:51:51,786 --> 00:51:54,151
Baron, I'm so pleased to see you.

440
00:51:55,689 --> 00:51:59,955
Sir Julian. You've never looked better.
Time you were married.

441
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,493
Yes, I agree.

442
00:52:02,462 --> 00:52:04,487
- Kemp.
- Julian.

443
00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:07,359
Lovely to see you.
I'm so pleased you could come.

444
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:11,333
I want you to do a portrait
of my beautiful Elizabeth one day.

445
00:52:13,238 --> 00:52:17,299
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
She looks radiant tonight.

446
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,945
- What is it?
- It's a man. A man in a crimson hood.

447
00:52:29,053 --> 00:52:30,918
It must be a highwayman.

448
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,247
Ruddock!

449
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,916
Bring the other servants.
There's a prowler about.

450
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,291
- Right. Out in the garden and search.
- Right.

451
00:52:38,629 --> 00:52:41,063
No, please, everyone don't leave.

452
00:52:41,232 --> 00:52:44,224
Don't leave. Believe me,
there's nothing to worry about.

453
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:46,825
The servants will take care
of everything.

454
00:52:46,937 --> 00:52:49,337
I want to drink a toast.

455
00:52:49,906 --> 00:52:51,237
To my wife!

456
00:52:53,343 --> 00:52:55,243
Lady Markham...

457
00:52:56,046 --> 00:52:58,947
I see nothing but happiness
and comfort ahead.

458
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:01,016
More than enough for just two.

459
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:05,853
Please, now, let's dance.

460
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,491
To assist you in your experiments.

461
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:51,364
Good night, Doctor, and sleep well.

462
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:40,039
- Aren't you frightened?
- Why should I be?

463
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:43,075
Me, a stranger, hiding under a hood.

464
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:47,143
You don't know...

465
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:06,860
You little slut! You were with him
last night, weren't you?

466
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:09,870
- Well, what if I was?
- That man is dangerous.

467
00:55:10,038 --> 00:55:13,633
That man's in pain.
You wouldn't feel sorry for a crippled dog.

468
00:55:13,742 --> 00:55:15,869
- Have you seen his face?
- No.

469
00:55:16,011 --> 00:55:17,740
But he's burned, isn't he?

470
00:55:18,213 --> 00:55:22,479
Why should I be afraid of scars when I see
all the dead bodies that you handle?

471
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:24,677
It makes my skin crawl.

472
00:55:26,555 --> 00:55:30,889
If that's all that's disturbing you,
you have nothing to worry about.

473
00:55:32,093 --> 00:55:34,561
You're dismissed! You can go home.

474
00:55:35,096 --> 00:55:38,293
I'm sure that with your abilities
you will find suitable lodgings...

475
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:40,162
and an appropriate position.

476
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:42,736
I'd need some money for that, Doctor.

477
00:55:45,005 --> 00:55:49,669
I said, you'd have to make it worth my
while to leave such a wonderful position.

478
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:54,503
Otherwise the village will hear more
about your surgical research.

479
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,648
Very well.

480
00:55:59,852 --> 00:56:03,310
But don't imagine that you're going to
indulge in a little blackmail...

481
00:56:03,422 --> 00:56:05,754
or breathe a word about that man.

482
00:56:05,858 --> 00:56:07,223
What if I do?

483
00:56:08,594 --> 00:56:12,257
I might find myself buying
your pretty little body one day.

484
00:56:12,464 --> 00:56:13,829
For a guinea or two.

485
00:56:25,743 --> 00:56:28,234
- Where is Sally?
- She's gone.

486
00:56:28,379 --> 00:56:29,607
Gone where?

487
00:56:30,248 --> 00:56:31,510
Gone away.

488
00:56:31,816 --> 00:56:33,807
Why? I wouldn't harm her.

489
00:56:34,152 --> 00:56:37,588
You can say what you please,
but she's not coming back.

490
00:56:38,756 --> 00:56:39,847
Remember this...

491
00:56:39,957 --> 00:56:43,916
you need me, and without my help
you wouldn't last one minute.

492
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:54,532
I've read your reference, Sally, and I see
no reason why you shouldn't start at once.

493
00:56:54,637 --> 00:56:58,903
- Thank you, milady.
- Sally, why did you leave Dr. Neuhartt?

494
00:57:01,344 --> 00:57:04,780
A relative came to stay.
There was no room for me.

495
00:57:05,581 --> 00:57:09,847
If you do your work satisfactorily here,
I think you'll find it a good situation.

496
00:57:09,952 --> 00:57:12,318
- Thank you, milady.
- Come with me, Sally.

497
00:57:16,459 --> 00:57:18,120
Pleasant-looking girl.

498
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:21,024
I want everything
to be perfect for you, Elizabeth.

499
00:57:21,129 --> 00:57:24,997
It will be.
The house looks wonderful, Julian.

500
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,837
- There's only one thing that frightens me.
- What's that?

501
00:57:30,171 --> 00:57:31,866
That room upstairs.

502
00:57:45,386 --> 00:57:47,819
- Here, look after him.
- Thank you, sir.

503
00:57:50,456 --> 00:57:54,085
Sir. Hello.
You doing anything tonight, sir?

504
00:57:54,794 --> 00:57:57,354
What do you got that mask on for?

505
00:57:58,164 --> 00:58:00,155
Hey now, get a hold of him.

506
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:02,132
Hey, Gov'nor.

507
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:11,343
I'm very sorry, gentlemen.

508
00:58:11,778 --> 00:58:13,336
It's perfectly all right.

509
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:16,877
- Perfectly all right, sir.
- Have you been to a party?

510
00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:20,778
- Looks like he's been to a fancy dress ball.
- Come in and have a drink.

511
00:58:20,886 --> 00:58:24,253
- Thank you, but I really haven't time.
- Come along with us.

512
00:58:24,523 --> 00:58:28,550
- Come to Macgregor's and have a drink.
- You're very kind, but I must be going.

513
00:58:29,627 --> 00:58:32,960
- Wait till you see what's going on there.
- Come on.

514
00:58:34,999 --> 00:58:37,559
You're very kind,
but perhaps another time.

515
00:59:34,589 --> 00:59:36,147
See what I mean?

516
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,434
- Sorry, dearie.
- What's he doing in that hood?

517
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,410
He must be very important
to hide his face.

518
01:00:02,282 --> 01:00:04,806
Or very ugly. Or both.

519
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:08,043
How are you tonight, dearie?

520
01:00:08,954 --> 01:00:12,788
Isn't that Prince what's-his-name?
Can they let him out at night?

521
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:25,159
- Too proud to show your face?
- Sally?

522
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:26,903
My name is Heidi.

523
01:00:28,473 --> 01:00:31,499
But for every taste we have a name.

524
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:36,839
If you want me to be Sally,
I will be Sally.

525
01:00:38,115 --> 01:00:39,844
Come with me.

526
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:02,965
How do you want me?

527
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:05,497
No, I shouldn't be here.

528
01:01:07,076 --> 01:01:08,771
Of course you should.

529
01:01:10,279 --> 01:01:13,372
What's the matter with you?
Are you frightened?

530
01:01:14,783 --> 01:01:17,911
You can leave on your mask.
I don't mind.

531
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:22,053
I like you as you are.

532
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:29,425
That will cost you extra.

533
01:02:44,669 --> 01:02:46,159
Give me the britches, darling.

534
01:03:21,269 --> 01:03:24,705
And the dress.
I said extra for the dress.

535
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,516
That's my wife there,
mister, understand?

536
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:46,383
If you're the Prince of Wales, it's gonna
cost you money to get outta here.

537
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:50,259
And if you are the Prince of Wales,
it'll cost you even more.

538
01:03:51,098 --> 01:03:54,727
And he has gold in his pockets
enough to blind you.

539
01:03:54,901 --> 01:03:57,960
Has he now?
You'd better hand it over then.

540
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,673
Who the devil are you?

541
01:04:08,514 --> 01:04:12,643
Come on, Heidi. We might have
a real treasure on our hands here.

542
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:15,744
Let's see what's behind this mask.

543
01:04:19,557 --> 01:04:21,821
No. You won't get out of here...

544
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,328
until I see your face.

545
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:04,091
- It's a bear!
- It's a dancing bear.

546
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:07,028
- Dance!
- It is a bear!

547
01:05:07,369 --> 01:05:08,336
Dance!

548
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,439
Yes, dance for us.

549
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:14,935
Dance.

550
01:05:19,347 --> 01:05:20,678
Get off me!

551
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,282
Get him.

552
01:05:35,563 --> 01:05:36,928
Boy! Stop!

553
01:05:37,364 --> 01:05:38,695
Come back here!

554
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:40,724
Stop him, someone.

555
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,407
What's the matter with him?

556
01:05:52,579 --> 01:05:54,171
Here, cut it out!

557
01:06:25,344 --> 01:06:26,504
Murder!

558
01:06:30,014 --> 01:06:32,574
Murder!

559
01:06:37,054 --> 01:06:38,851
Bloody murder.

560
01:06:52,269 --> 01:06:56,398
- What kind of a beast did that?
- I've told you. It was the man...

561
01:06:56,505 --> 01:07:00,566
- I know. The man in the crimson hood.
- Going downstairs?

562
01:07:02,778 --> 01:07:04,336
Away, all of you.

563
01:07:07,249 --> 01:07:08,910
Out of the way. Go on.

564
01:07:09,685 --> 01:07:13,781
- You must know who he was.
- Well, I don't.

565
01:07:13,923 --> 01:07:16,585
And you didn't want to lose
this future customer?

566
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:17,749
No.

567
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:22,421
You don't think I'd set a loony
straight out of Bedlam on my lady, do you?

568
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,725
Knowing you, Harry, I'd say yes.

569
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,559
But we'll find out, won't we?

570
01:07:27,902 --> 01:07:30,097
If anybody knows anything,
bring them along.

571
01:07:30,205 --> 01:07:32,400
Very good, Mr. Hawthorne, sir.

572
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:37,939
You say this hooded figure had money.

573
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,476
So Heidi told me.

574
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:43,846
Which you were both going to
relieve him of?

575
01:07:44,051 --> 01:07:45,518
No, we weren't.

576
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:48,950
No. You wouldn't do
anything like that, would you?

577
01:07:49,156 --> 01:07:50,588
No, of course not.

578
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:55,525
- Would you say he was of the gentry?
- I don't know. He never talked to me.

579
01:07:56,128 --> 01:07:59,757
Excuse me, sir. Take a look at this.
A cloak with blood on it.

580
01:08:00,366 --> 01:08:03,096
- Hey, that's his cloak.
- That's his, all right!

581
01:08:03,536 --> 01:08:06,061
- And he was wearing this cloak?
- Yes.

582
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:11,206
'J. N.'

583
01:08:13,379 --> 01:08:15,347
- I wonder.
- What?

584
01:08:16,082 --> 01:08:18,845
If there's anything
underneath that tape.

585
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:27,985
'E. P. Higgs.'

586
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,318
'Tailor.'

587
01:08:30,961 --> 01:08:32,360
'Langford.'

588
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,214
There we are. Now you take those
and come back to see me in two days.

589
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,854
- Good bye.
- Bye, Doctor.

590
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:02,224
Hope you feel better soon.

591
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:36,781
- Dr. Neuhartt?
- Yes?

592
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:40,557
I'm a Crown Officer from London.
I want to speak to you.

593
01:09:41,628 --> 01:09:43,619
Very well. Won't you come in?

594
01:09:56,009 --> 01:09:59,069
These are your initials, Doctor,
and this is your cloak.

595
01:09:59,179 --> 01:10:01,579
The tailor who made it told us so.

596
01:10:02,248 --> 01:10:03,977
Yes, they are mine.

597
01:10:06,086 --> 01:10:07,245
Why, that's blood.

598
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:10,981
Blood of a tart in London
who got her throat cut.

599
01:10:12,191 --> 01:10:15,126
- Throat cut?
- By someone wearing that cloak.

600
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:17,689
I don't understand.

601
01:10:18,263 --> 01:10:21,129
Dr. Neuhartt,
I must ask you some questions.

602
01:10:21,265 --> 01:10:23,256
Where were you last night?

603
01:10:23,735 --> 01:10:27,501
I was at the house of Mr. Jenkins,
the local magistrate. I was dining there.

604
01:10:27,605 --> 01:10:29,368
He will confirm that.

605
01:10:29,874 --> 01:10:33,401
Could you possibly explain how your cloak
came to be worn in London?

606
01:10:33,511 --> 01:10:37,207
Why, no, I can't. I lost it.
I must have left it somewhere.

607
01:10:37,447 --> 01:10:38,379
Where?

608
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:43,208
If I knew that, Mr. Hawthorne,
I wouldn't have lost it, would I?

609
01:10:44,988 --> 01:10:49,118
I suggest you obtain confirmation of
my presence in Langford last night...

610
01:10:49,226 --> 01:10:52,787
and continue your investigations
in London and take these with you.

611
01:11:06,075 --> 01:11:08,635
- Good day to you.
- Thank you, Doctor. Good day.

612
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,830
- What did you tell them?
- I told them nothing.

613
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:39,170
You killed that woman, didn't you?

614
01:11:47,714 --> 01:11:50,274
That's an interesting group
you have up there.

615
01:11:50,384 --> 01:11:52,011
Thank you, Julian.

616
01:11:53,187 --> 01:11:55,382
That's a fine composition.

617
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:59,056
I have a great deal of work
to do on that yet.

618
01:12:00,893 --> 01:12:04,761
Here is a portrait that I just finished
for Lord Wallace.

619
01:12:06,098 --> 01:12:08,931
I'd suggest the same size
for Lady Elizabeth.

620
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:12,996
A different style, of course,
for her entrancing beauty.

621
01:12:14,606 --> 01:12:18,804
Julian, here are some more things
I think you might be interested in.

622
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:24,540
- That's a wonderful landscape.
- I think I can really be pleased with that.

623
01:12:25,249 --> 01:12:29,913
You see this strong line coming
from left to right, right across the picture.

624
01:12:31,322 --> 01:12:33,984
- Another line...
- Who is that a portrait of?

625
01:12:35,759 --> 01:12:38,193
It's just a sketch I did from memory.

626
01:12:39,196 --> 01:12:40,663
From memory?

627
01:12:41,532 --> 01:12:45,332
Yes, some unknown man
my dog found dead in the river.

628
01:12:47,204 --> 01:12:50,401
Now this other strong line
coming from top...

629
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:51,729
- Julian?
- Yes.

630
01:12:51,841 --> 01:12:55,368
You don't know who it is, do you?
Quite a shock it was.

631
01:12:55,545 --> 01:12:57,274
It just caught my eye.

632
01:12:57,914 --> 01:13:00,075
Yes, it's quite an interesting face.

633
01:13:00,183 --> 01:13:03,516
One plummets the depths for answers.
Only the customs...

634
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,246
Would you sell it?

635
01:13:05,487 --> 01:13:08,854
Sell it? My dear Julian,
you can have it for nothing.

636
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:13,225
- Mysteries just disturb me.
- That's very kind of you, thank you.

637
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:17,727
Now for this forest picture,
I tried to get the feeling of the forest...

638
01:13:19,467 --> 01:13:22,994
But I'm afraid I'm going to have
to be running along now.

639
01:13:23,538 --> 01:13:26,803
We can work out the sittings later on.

640
01:13:27,975 --> 01:13:30,739
Thank you so much,
I've really enjoyed...

641
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:39,549
You and Norton threw that body
into the river. Why?

642
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:42,012
- That's rubbish! Who says that?
- I do.

643
01:13:42,123 --> 01:13:44,956
Because it's now in the hands
of a parish magistrate.

644
01:13:45,059 --> 01:13:47,788
There was nothing on the body
to say who it was.

645
01:13:47,894 --> 01:13:52,058
Except that it had been viewed earlier
by the people of my village...

646
01:13:52,165 --> 01:13:54,531
as the body of my late brother.

647
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:56,166
And not only that.

648
01:13:56,269 --> 01:14:01,171
The man who found it was an artist.
He made a sketch. Look.

649
01:14:02,241 --> 01:14:04,903
Fortunately,
I managed to get hold of it.

650
01:14:05,144 --> 01:14:07,977
Why didn't you put the body
back where it came from?

651
01:14:08,147 --> 01:14:10,308
- Because it was too risky.
- Why?

652
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,846
Because it was. That's why.

653
01:14:13,084 --> 01:14:14,346
Trench...

654
01:14:14,886 --> 01:14:16,751
how did that man die?

655
01:14:17,455 --> 01:14:20,822
- What are you so inquisitive about...
- What grave did it come from?

656
01:14:20,925 --> 01:14:23,894
- What's this all about?
- You heard what I said. Answer me.

657
01:14:23,995 --> 01:14:25,519
What are you hiding?

658
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:28,895
- I've got enough troubles of me own!
- I'm not hiding anything, man.

659
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,594
There's something going on
I don't like the sound of.

660
01:14:31,703 --> 01:14:34,228
If it's as important as that
for you to know...

661
01:14:34,339 --> 01:14:38,298
then it'd be far more important for me
not to tell you. And I'm not going to!

662
01:14:38,409 --> 01:14:42,037
And another thing. After this,
there'll be no more dealings with me.

663
01:14:42,212 --> 01:14:44,180
You've become far too nosy.

664
01:14:44,281 --> 01:14:47,148
In my business,
that's taking too much of a risk.

665
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,980
- Weller...
- Good day, Doctor.

666
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:01,730
After Edward was free,
what happened then?

667
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,158
Nothing.

668
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,231
You locked him up, you nailed him down.

669
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,303
- Our plan didn't work.
- Go on.

670
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,233
Rescue was out of the question.

671
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:18,302
My God, Trench,
do you know what that means?

672
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,274
It means that my brother
was buried alive!

673
01:16:03,555 --> 01:16:05,216
It's all gone.

674
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:17,626
I'll go and get some more.

675
01:16:51,768 --> 01:16:54,635
You haven't been looking for me,
have you, Trench?

676
01:16:54,738 --> 01:16:56,399
And we did have a bargain.

677
01:16:57,506 --> 01:16:58,837
My God.

678
01:17:00,175 --> 01:17:01,608
Sir Edward.

679
01:17:02,945 --> 01:17:05,573
- I thought you'd been...
- Buried?

680
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:07,405
Yes.

681
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:12,319
Waking up in that horrible oblong box.
No air to breathe.

682
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:14,452
Trapped and no escape.

683
01:17:14,857 --> 01:17:16,791
The earth raining down on the lid.

684
01:17:16,892 --> 01:17:19,383
Every shovelful burying you more deeply.

685
01:17:22,464 --> 01:17:25,330
No, Sir Edward. Julian...

686
01:17:25,967 --> 01:17:28,401
Julian is to blame. I can explain.

687
01:17:31,239 --> 01:17:35,335
All I want is that witch doctor!
That was the bargain, after all.

688
01:17:38,078 --> 01:17:40,012
The Starbuck Inn.

689
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,715
Shoreham.

690
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:47,547
Shoreham.

691
01:17:57,396 --> 01:17:59,956
Trench. Why Shoreham?

692
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:01,555
He was waiting...

693
01:18:01,967 --> 01:18:03,059
for a ship.

694
01:18:03,169 --> 01:18:05,967
Waiting? Why not waiting for me?

695
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:31,884
Are you the man I made my medicine for?

696
01:19:33,487 --> 01:19:34,715
Yes.

697
01:19:36,223 --> 01:19:38,282
It worked only too well.

698
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,724
Tell me.

699
01:19:46,766 --> 01:19:49,166
Have you seen a face like mine before?

700
01:19:54,073 --> 01:19:55,131
Once.

701
01:19:56,376 --> 01:19:58,742
I want to know. Can you help me?

702
01:20:00,413 --> 01:20:02,040
Yes. For gold.

703
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:11,387
Sit down.

704
01:20:17,829 --> 01:20:21,765
Do you know what happened in Africa?
Why they did this to me?

705
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:23,464
I must know.

706
01:20:35,446 --> 01:20:37,970
You are riding through the plantation.

707
01:20:38,315 --> 01:20:40,476
A white king amongst his black slaves...

708
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:44,045
who are too ignorant to know
that you are an enemy.

709
01:20:44,154 --> 01:20:45,143
No.

710
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:11,077
No!

711
01:21:35,235 --> 01:21:36,862
I don't understand.

712
01:21:37,971 --> 01:21:39,370
I know it wasn't me.

713
01:21:41,775 --> 01:21:44,039
You are the man they call Markham?

714
01:21:45,178 --> 01:21:48,238
It is also the name of my brother.

715
01:21:49,883 --> 01:21:51,248
Markham.

716
01:22:48,072 --> 01:22:51,041
You changed nothing!
It's still the same!

717
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,136
You've got to help me, Doctor.

718
01:23:28,209 --> 01:23:32,077
You've got to give me something
to keep me going until the morning.

719
01:23:33,547 --> 01:23:35,606
Very well, come with me.

720
01:23:43,257 --> 01:23:47,091
- What's amusing you?
- It seems you started a fad, my dear...

721
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,661
when you claimed that you saw
a man with a crimson hood.

722
01:23:50,763 --> 01:23:52,731
I did see him, you know I did!

723
01:23:52,832 --> 01:23:55,995
Everybody's seeing him now.
There's a story here about a man...

724
01:23:56,102 --> 01:23:59,868
in a crimson hood who murdered
a woman in London. He slit her throat.

725
01:24:01,507 --> 01:24:03,998
- What is it, Sally?
- I can't believe it!

726
01:24:04,443 --> 01:24:07,674
- What?
- That he'd do such a terrible thing!

727
01:24:08,647 --> 01:24:11,514
Sally, have you seen
a man in a crimson hood?

728
01:24:12,518 --> 01:24:16,453
There's a man staying with
Dr. Neuhartt who wears a hood like that.

729
01:24:16,554 --> 01:24:19,250
- A man who wears a hood.
- I promised not to tell anyone!

730
01:24:19,357 --> 01:24:22,485
Dr. Neuhartt. Yes, of course.

731
01:24:23,828 --> 01:24:27,161
Elizabeth, forgive me,
I'm going out for a little while.

732
01:24:27,365 --> 01:24:28,992
Look after Sally.

733
01:24:29,433 --> 01:24:30,593
Ruddock.

734
01:24:43,914 --> 01:24:46,906
If you don't keep off your feet,
you'll be dead in the morning.

735
01:24:47,017 --> 01:24:50,316
That's all the time in the world
for what I have to do.

736
01:24:51,121 --> 01:24:53,885
- More debts?
- The final debts.

737
01:24:54,391 --> 01:24:55,823
And more blood?

738
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:59,719
First I want the reasons, Doctor,
then perhaps the blood.

739
01:25:00,362 --> 01:25:02,830
'Blood will have blood, ' so they say.

740
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:09,593
Can't you understand?
You know what's been done to me.

741
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:13,006
Wouldn't you want the truth
and then your revenge?

742
01:25:13,107 --> 01:25:15,837
How do you expect me
to know how you feel?

743
01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:17,405
Here, drink this.

744
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:19,914
What is this?

745
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:24,048
It's what you wanted. Something
to keep you on your feet until the morning.

746
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:27,416
Or something to put me
back in the grave for eternity!

747
01:25:55,314 --> 01:25:58,340
Why don't you sit down, my dear.
You look very pale.

748
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:01,286
I feel a lot better now.

749
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,750
I think we could both do
with a little brandy.

750
01:26:03,856 --> 01:26:05,413
No, I'll get it.

751
01:26:22,807 --> 01:26:27,553
Hello? Anyone there?
Open up! Hello? Hello?

752
01:26:35,853 --> 01:26:36,877
Hello?

753
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:20,894
Who did this?

754
01:27:21,963 --> 01:27:24,124
He attacked...

755
01:27:24,232 --> 01:27:26,165
A man in a crimson hood?

756
01:27:27,034 --> 01:27:28,695
Where did he come from?

757
01:27:28,803 --> 01:27:31,897
He was still warm and straight
from the grave. Was that it?

758
01:27:32,473 --> 01:27:34,737
Where did he go? I must find him.

759
01:27:35,576 --> 01:27:39,410
Markham Manor.

760
01:27:39,647 --> 01:27:41,113
Markham.

761
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,185
- No!
- Sally...

762
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:27,453
- You have to help me!
- You're a murderer!

763
01:28:27,558 --> 01:28:30,925
- You don't understand anything!
- Please don't kill me!

764
01:28:31,028 --> 01:28:34,327
- I must find Julian. Where is he?
- He's not here!

765
01:28:34,432 --> 01:28:35,591
You're lying!

766
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,721
Elizabeth. What happened?

767
01:29:06,862 --> 01:29:09,353
It was Sally.
She was here just a moment ago.

768
01:29:09,465 --> 01:29:10,932
- Sally?
- Look!

769
01:29:20,442 --> 01:29:22,740
- It's Edward.
- Edward?

770
01:29:22,844 --> 01:29:26,143
Yes. I can't explain it now.

771
01:29:27,515 --> 01:29:30,381
I'm going out. You stay here, Elizabeth.

772
01:29:31,318 --> 01:29:33,513
- Julian!
- Please, stay here!

773
01:30:45,188 --> 01:30:46,348
Edward.

774
01:30:47,457 --> 01:30:48,890
Edward, stop!

775
01:30:52,295 --> 01:30:53,922
Why, Julian?

776
01:30:56,199 --> 01:30:58,895
Edward, stop! Let me explain!

777
01:30:59,369 --> 01:31:00,859
Why, Julian?

778
01:31:01,271 --> 01:31:03,102
Edward, it was an accident.

779
01:31:03,907 --> 01:31:04,874
You!

780
01:31:05,807 --> 01:31:08,469
- This should have been you!
- Yes, I know!

781
01:31:09,044 --> 01:31:12,377
They were looking for a Markham
to pay back their debts.

782
01:31:12,614 --> 01:31:16,380
They found their Markham,
but they took you and not me.

783
01:31:16,618 --> 01:31:19,108
There was nothing I could do.
It was too late.

784
01:31:19,854 --> 01:31:23,119
It's not too late, Julian.
Let them have both of us!

785
01:32:31,722 --> 01:32:33,781
This is the one you wanted.

786
01:32:36,727 --> 01:32:38,786
- Edward Markham?
- Yes.

787
01:32:39,062 --> 01:32:40,222
Go now.

788
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:47,296
Markham.

789
01:33:25,172 --> 01:33:26,400
Where is Sir Julian?

790
01:33:26,507 --> 01:33:29,533
I think he went
to the top of the house, madam.

791
01:34:09,748 --> 01:34:11,375
Julian, what is it?

792
01:34:14,753 --> 01:34:15,947
Nothing.

793
01:34:20,858 --> 01:34:24,589
- This is Edward's room, isn't it?
- No, Elizabeth.

794
01:34:30,134 --> 01:34:31,897
This is my room.
