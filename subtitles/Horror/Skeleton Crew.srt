Just do it, baby.
[Sobbing]

163
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,043
Just do it.

164
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,546
[Sobbing, Muttering]

00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:28,020
[Panting]

166
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,689
I can't do this!

167
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,824
It's the only way.

168
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,194
[Stammers]

169
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,233
I love you, baby.

170
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,935
I love you too.

[Crying]

173
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:07,025
Brava! I was right.

174
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,995
I felt it immediately
when I first met you.

175
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,698
You're a natural-born
killer.

176
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:20,272
Are you ready
for your grand finale, Lisa?

177
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,742
[Panting]
Stop.

178
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:27,212
Please.
Oh, don't worry.
You're going to be a big star.

179
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,854
[Man]
Cut!
[Whirring Stops]

180
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,423
Cut, cut, cut.

181
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,059
What happened?
The production designer
didn't do her job properly.

182
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,829
You can see a reflection
of the camera in the mirror.
Anna!

183
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:48,033
- Do we have to do it again?
- Yes.

184
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,636
What's wrong?
You didn't fix the mirror.
You can see the camera in it.

185
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,439
Put something on it,
and do it quickly.
We haven't got all day.

186
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,209
What time is it?
Almost 5:30.

187
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,179
Is there time
for a smoke?
Yeah, sure, sure.

188
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,117
Okay. Chop-chop, people.
Get to work.

189
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,089
You're doing really well.
This is gonna be great.
Thank you.

190
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,292
This film is gonna be like
a Saw or a Hostel
kind of thing, you know.

191
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,294
Well, I hope
there'll be many sequels.

192
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:21,433
Yeah. I have
some ideas about that.
Silent Creek II: The Beginning.

193
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,502
Well, none of that
prequel stuff.

194
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,504
I mean,
something that gives me
more work.

195
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,306
Well, I'm not really sure
if your character's
gonna stay alive after all.

196
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,308
[Groans]
We might have to do
an alternative ending.

197
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,912
That was excellent,
right?
Yes, Bruce.

198
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,314
I think the classic
Christopher Lee approach
is the way to go.

199
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,084
Absolutely.
So you're happy then.
Let's keep going.

200
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,920
Well, I was thinking
that maybe we could do
a couple of takes...

201
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,922
where we take it easy
a bit, you know?

202
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,125
Not overdo it so much.
Mmm, I don't think so.

203
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,127
I think this is
the way to go.

204
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:53,532
Believe me, I know how
to create an unforgettably
evil character.

205
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,536
You're looking at a man whom
even Sam Raimi couldn't convince
of his acting technique.

206
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,338
And that boy's
got a vision!
Yeah.

207
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,743
I suppose you're right.
We should stick to the genre.
I'll see you in a bit, Bruce.

208
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,145
How's it going?
Good.

209
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,348
Yeah. I think this is
gonna be fine.
Yeah, I'm sure it will.

210
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,552
The setting's great,
but we could have shot this
in L.A., you know.

211
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,354
But shooting it here
is just as well.

212
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,356
This location is awesome.

213
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,759
This is the actual place
where the murders took place.

214
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,962
It's ready. It's free.
This would have cost
a fortune in L.A.

215
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,566
Well, the walls
and the ceiling,
they're perfectly decayed.

216
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,769
You know, actually,
I was thinking we should
get a couple of angled shots.

217
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,972
You know, just to do
the place justice.
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

218
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,974
I still think it's wrong.

219
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,978
I know that hospitals were
a bit run down in the '70s,
but they weren't as bad as this.

220
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,980
It's a film.
It's the Soviet Union.

221
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,382
Anything
could have happened.
It's set in Finland.

222
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,552
[Scoffs] Whatever!
Same thing. No one cares
about the tiny details.

223
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,588
They're interested
in the bigger picture.

224
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,390
Anyway, it's a horror film,
right? Anything happens.
Yeah.

225
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,594
Whatever. It's your film.
Your name, your problem.

226
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,596
Look. How long
till we can continue?

227
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:01,199
About 10 minutes.
You've got five.

228
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,402
What's up with these Finns?
Why's there always
problems with them?

229
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:08,006
Not enough California sun
and vitamin "D."
Yeah. Too right.

230
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,809
Lisa though--
She's easy to work with.
Yes.

231
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,811
I'm just gonna go
listen to some more praise.

232
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,418
What's he smiling about?
Fucking dickhead.

233
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:24,022
Yeah. I mean, doesn't he realize
that the film is total crap?
Yeah.

234
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,825
And what the fuck was up
with that nightmare scene?

235
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,628
He's making up these
extra scenes all the time.

236
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,632
I wish
I'd fucking known this.

237
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,835
You know, I would have been
the boom operator for
the next season of Idols.

238
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,436
Mmm.
Yeah.

239
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,839
And even that
would have been better
than this shit.

240
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,841
Yeah, and we'd get paid
on time.

241
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,011
You know, if he still
hasn't paid us on Friday,
I'm leaving.

Powder fix.
Please spread it on evenly.

245
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:00,659
I've got my close-up shots soon.
Somebody's got to look good
in this film.

246
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,663
Okay. So let's stick
with the same foundation
you had on this morning.

247
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,898
Yeah. It's stayed on
pretty well.

248
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,534
Sit down.
I can't reach
if you're standing up.

249
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,737
Speaking of reaching,
I was once in a film...

250
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,741
with Michael Douglas,
Kathleen Turner
and Danny DeVito.

251
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,945
It was a black comedy.
And all the actors--
all of us--

252
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,949
were playing practical jokes
on each other throughout
the whole shoot.

253
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,718
One day, we were in this
very small, hot studio.

254
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,387
Well, at the end of the day,
I hit the showers.

255
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,790
I knew DeVito
was right behind me.

256
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,760
Then I remembered this
absolutely disgusting joke
he played on me.

257
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,165
Now, I'm coming out of
the shower and I'm thinking,
payback time!

258
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:46,171
Me, Bruce-- six-point-two.
Danny-- four-point-
absolutely nothing!

259
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,772
Mmm.
I take the showerhead.

260
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,942
I put it all the way
at the top of the shower.

261
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,512
And then I leave,
looking back
and see DeVito go in.

262
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,716
[Chuckles]
I was pissing in my pants
with laughter--

263
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,553
this image of him
jumping up and down
to grab that showerhead.

264
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,355
Did DeVito get you back?
[Chuckles]
No.

265
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,792
It was just a short gig for me.
Just a couple of days
of filming.

266
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,862
Have you been doing
a lot of acting
in big Hollywood films?

267
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:15,533
Oh, sure.
I was in James Cameron's
Pariah II.

268
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,336
I've been in a bunch
of Steven Seagal films.

269
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:22,674
Steve is a close
personal friend of mine.
He's helped me with my acting.

270
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:27,212
I even know a couple
of Finns. I was a corpse
in Renny Harlin's Prison.

271
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,614
But this is something else.

272
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,651
To think that they're making
a film about something...

273
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,855
that actually happened
30 years ago on this
exact location.

274
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,824
Yeah, it's pretty freaky.
I read about this...

275
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,861
Dr. Anderson,
how he started to call himself
"The Auteur"...

276
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:46,398
because he was fascinated
with French film directors
from the '70s.

277
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,501
You know, like Godard
and Truffaut.

278
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:54,406
Although he filmed,
tortured and killed
his own patients for real.

279
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,175
Ha!
I don't think that's part
of the French New Wave!

280
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,946
I can't understand
why anyone would want to make,
let alone watch, snuff films.

281
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:05,950
[Scoffs]
What's the difference between
a snuff film and Big Brother?

282
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,954
People secretly want
to watch other people
behind a closed curtain.

283
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,190
They want to see
someone's other side,

284
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,193
the side they normally
don't see.

285
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,228
I think he was
basically good.

286
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,230
Nobody could be that bad.

287
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,434
And that's
what fascinates me
about this character.

288
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:27,138
I plan to portray him
as being this touching
and misunderstood man.

289
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:31,476
I know what
the audience likes.
Believe me.

290
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,946
[Panting]

291
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,453
Do you like that?
Yeah.

292
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,857
You want me
to keep going?
Yeah.

293
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,259
Then I want something too.
What?

294
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,662
I want a sequel.

295
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,064
You're gonna be a star.

296
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,002
[Panting]

297
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,975
Yeah.
Get ready to scream!

298
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,844
[Screaming]

299
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,147

Excellent, people.

00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,850
Good work. Good shot.

Very good. Very good.
Right. Let's move on.

[Line Beeps, Clicks]

Hey, Jerry, it's Steven
calling from Finland.

304
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,995
Hi, Steven.
How you doing?

305
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,798
I'm good, thanks.
How are you?
You in L.A.?

306
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,601
Well, you know us producers--
always working.

307
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,603
Actually, I'm at
the studio right now.

308
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,773
I'm having a meeting
with the studio executives
about your film.

309
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,009
Everybody's really
ramped up about it.
Okay. That sounds great.

310
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,214
Listen. I'm a little bit
worried that there's a problem
with the funding.

311
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:46,017
Is everything okay?
No, no.
There's no problem.

312
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,419
Everything's in order.
Don't you worry.

313
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,824
Okay. Good. Because the Finnish
crew said they would quit
if there's no money by Friday.

314
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,226
There will be.
I'm on it.

315

Is this all right,

00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,676
A little bit lower,

320
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,846
All right.
[Groans]

321
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,061
We'll start recording
the background sounds
at the other end.

322
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,264
[Sighs] I don't think
it even matters what
we're doing in here.

323
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,434
This project will never
see the light of day anyway.

324
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,671
I can't believe he decided
to dub the whole soundtrack
later on.

325
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,274
Yeah. With those actors.
Good luck with that.

326
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,418
[Scoffs]

Hey, listen to this.

[Indistinct Voice, Distant]

331
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,606
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

332
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,841
Did you hear
someone talking?

333
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,077
No, I didn't hear a thing.

334
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,047
Do you still hear it?

335
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,651
No. Not anymore.

336
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,254
Maybe it came from upstairs.

337
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,096
Hey, what's that?

338
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,502
I don't know.

339
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,707
Looks like
a sealed room.

340
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:53,511
You know it can't be.
The only place we can't
get in is the attic.

341
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,783
It is a room,
and there's a light on.

342
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,019
That's impossible.

343

has been cut off.
Yeah?

344
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,958
No. It's been cut off
for a long time.

345
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,860
For years.

346

Hey, hey.

349
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,977
Is this
what I think it is?

350
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,656
We've found them.

351
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,760
The Auteur's snuff films.
We've found them!

352
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,898
How is this possible?

353
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,301
Didn't the police take
all the films in the '70s?

354
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:27,705
Yes, but they found
a small storage room
next to the coffee lounge.

355
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:33,111
He had hidden a small
snuff library behind some
other legitimate films.

356
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,180
And if I have it right,
the whole hospital
was turned upside down.

357
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,649
Yes, but they didn't find
these ones.

358
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,452
The police were suspicious
because they couldn't find
the darkroom...

359
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,088
where the films had been
developed, let alone where
they would watch them.

360
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:48,526
During the investigation,
the authorities compared
the list of the patients...

361
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,928
with those
of the natural deaths
that occurred...

362
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,331
during the senior
physician's time.

363
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,100
The records showed that there
should have been more victims.

364
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,102
But there was
no hard evidence
until now.

365
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,174
[Lisa] Are you sure
we should do that?
[Woman] I agree.

366
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,644
We should call the police.
[Man] Oh, come on!
Let's see what it is.

367
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,613
It might be nothing.

368
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,948
Steven, don't turn it on.

369
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,117
I sure as hell
am not watching anything.

370
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,353

if you don't want to.

But I'm gonna to stay.
- Why?

372
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:23,294
We are making a film based on
these snuff films, people.

373
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,497
A film about the man who's
responsible for all of this.

374
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,300
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity...

00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,770
to see what material
he really produced.

Do you really want to let this
opportunity pass you by?

This is the best
preproduction research ever.
