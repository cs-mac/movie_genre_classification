      -Why have you come?

       You were banished

    You summoned my brother     
       home from abroad.

00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,495
Did you think that I would stand
     by and let him assume

00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,263
      the mantle of power?

      I'm your firstborn.

       The bloodstone is

        You crave evil.         

13
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,753
   The bloodstone would give    
      you too much power.

 here after you've come all the

         wasn't exactly

         be exhausted.

   You can tell us everything   
        that's happened         

39
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,349
    since you left America.

        us a good hotel?

     A bathroom, at least?

       -Well, I inquired

   -It's not a parade, dummy.

        It's a funeral.

  place where 500 years ago, a

 handful of Transylvanians held 
  on against an army of Turks.

      spying on the monks?

       Come, I show you.        

103
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:56,975
 In 1443, Vlad Dracula raised a  
   large army of peasants to    

104
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,777
  defend all of Transylvania.

        a savage attack.        

108
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,122
   The survivors held out as    
      long as they could.       

109
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,460
     Soon, the food and the     
         water ran out.         

110
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,330
  -I read a translation of one  
   of the survivor's diaries.   

111
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,733
 -Then you know what happened.  

112
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,636
 -There were less than 100 left 
     alive in the fortress.     

113
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,239
   -They were waiting to die,   
      but no one attacked.      

114
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:32,110
 Finally, some brave souls went 
     outside the fortress.      

115
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:35,213
   They found many dead Turks   
      with bloody throats.      

116
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:38,016
     The rest had run away.     

117
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,418
  The peasants believed it was  
     the work of vampires.

00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,856
         -And still do.

      Let's check it out.

128
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,423
              Wow.              

129
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,461
  -The monks who occupied this  
  place were well prepared for  

130
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,197
         the afterlife.         

131
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,098
             Come.              

132
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,499
         There's food.          

133
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,578
          -Mm, great.           

134
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,779
         I'm starving.          

135
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,189
     -[speaking romanian].      

136
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,893
 -Are we the only guests here?  

137
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,427
      Besides the ghosts?       

138
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,663
  -There is one other scholar   
  staying here at the moment.   

139
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,398
    -Oh, another folklorist?    

140
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,233
         -A zoologist.          

141
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,602
      But I doubt you will      
        see much of him.        

142
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,738
    He's busy with his work.    

143
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,609
If you'll excuse me, I will get 
    the rest of your things.    

144
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,177
         -[inaudible].          

145
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,545
              Hmm.              

146
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,882
   -Here's toasting Prejmer.    

147
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,050
     May we all publish our     

148
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,754
dissertations and get our PhDs. 

149
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,022
      -Is there any white?      

150
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,858
    -Oh, in Transylvania the    
       best wine is red--       

151
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,259
           blood red.           

152
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,678
    RADU: Bring     
       me the bloodstone.       

153
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:47,772
     MICHELLE:      
      This is incredible.       

154
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,240
            -Mm-hm.             

155
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:52,810
 According to the legend, this  
    was a place inhabited by    

156
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,746
 vampires in the 14th century.  

157
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,692
     -[speaking romanian].      

158
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:48,533
              -OK.              

159
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:52,737
        One, two, three.        

160
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,205
      Hope this comes out.      

161
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,640
  There's barely enough light.  

162
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,780
MARA: You know, the 
    funny thin about Castle     

163
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,317
 Vladislas is that nobody ever  
    says anything about it.     

164
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,751
         -You're right.         

165
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,955
  Nobody's mentioned it once.   

166
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:44,856
      LILLIAN:      
      Let's see if we can       

167
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,224
     get inside the castle.     

168
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,892
     I've never been inside     
          one before.           

169
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,527
 -Come on, we can't right now.  

170
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,228
     It's getting too dark.     

171
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,596
     We've got to get back.     

172
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:52,563
         -Oh, come on.          

173
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,664
   Don't poop out on me now.    

174
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:18,756
       -Come on, Lillian.       

175
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,158
          I'm hungry.           

176
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,061
             -Ouch.             

177
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,066
           Oh, shit.            

178
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,170
       -God, are you OK?        

179
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:35,173
      We'd better get back      
        and wash it off.        

180
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,340
            Come on.            

181
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,017
           -Hi, guys.           

182
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,619
       -How is your room?       

183
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,187
     -I think it'll be OK.      

184
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,793
          What's this?          

185
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,528
MICHELLE: Well, you 
    know, I've been thinking    

186
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,331
   about what Mara said this    
  afternoon, about no one ever  

187
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,433
  mentioning Castle Vladislas.  

188
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,168
       And I went through       
         all my notes.          

189
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,136
 I even looked at the index of  
   all the stuff that's been    

190
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,405
  published about this region   
        over the years.         

191
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,874
 Not one mention of the castle. 

192
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,409
      -Strange, isn't it?       

193
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,478
     -Well, it just doesn't     
          make sense.           

194
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,581
  How can something as old and  
 imposing as that castle not be 

195
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,416
    part of the local lore?     

196
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,385
  -Maybe even something that's  
   been here as long as that    

197
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,787
    castle becomes invisible    
         to all but the         

198
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,189
      most sensitive eyes.      

199
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,795
 Pardon me if I frightened you. 

200
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,397
   My name is Stefan Belescu.   

201
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:09,900
    -Oh, the zoologist Karl     
         told us about.         

202
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,036
             -Yes.              

203
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,771
         -I'm Lillian.          

204
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,039
        That's Mara, and        
        the hardworking         

205
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,842
   scholar here is Michelle.    

206
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:20,578
 -I thought I should introduce  
 myself so you won't be alarmed 

207
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,781
    if you see me coming or     
      going at odd hours.       

208
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,850
  -Would you like to join us?   

209
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,018
    -I can't at the moment.     

210
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,719
      My research keeps me      
         busy at night.         

211
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:31,088
     -What kind of research     
           do you do?           

212
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,924
   -I'm cataloging nocturnal    
          animal life           

213
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,493
      unique to this area.      

214
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:38,763
I'm afraid it's a rather boring 
    subject to most people.     

215
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:39,730
          -Oh, no, no.          

216
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,132
           Not to us.           

217
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,533
Um, we're studying the folklore 
       of the region, and       

218
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:45,736
      animals often figure      
         in folktales.          

219
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,738
     Please, tell us more.      

220
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,708
    -Another time, perhaps.     

221
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,809
           I must go.           

222
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,210
            Ladies.             

223
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:59,183
     -Animals often figure      
          in folklore.          

224
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:02,720
     Please, tell us more.      

225
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,121
         -Knock it off.         

226
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,036
    -Hey, wait up, you guys.    

227
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,039
      Let's rest a minute.      

228
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:27,278
   -Not yet, in just a little   
   bit farther up this hill.    

229
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,212
   MICHELLE: Five   
     interviews in one day.     

230
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,647
     Not a bad start, huh?      

231
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,749
MARA: And this could
      be the best one yet.      

232
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,451
 This old lady is very strange. 

233
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,596
  This is the mask you wear at  
  the festival of the undead?   

234
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:52,103
     -It's likeness of the      
       gypsy who made the       

235
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,504
    truce with the vampires.    

236
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:07,752
  Wear the mask and I tell you  
    the story of the gypsy.     

237
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:12,156
 The vampires killed the Turks. 

238
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:18,863
  And in gratitude, the people  
 said, let them have the great  

239
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:24,368
     ruins, which is where      
      the vampires sleep.       

240
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,339
       The vampires were        
         still hungry.          

241
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:31,876
      They would come out       
       of their wings at        

242
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:35,246
     night and drink blood.     

243
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:46,123
  This gypsy, he knew that the  
 pope of Rome had a stone which 

244
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,427
      dripped the blood of      
        all the saints.         

245
00:23:49,429 --> 00:24:02,006
 So she went to Rome, stole the 
 stone, and took it to the king 

246
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:03,407
        of the vampires.        

247
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:12,650
    And since that time, no     
       one in Prejmer has       

248
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:15,553
   been bitten by a vampire.    

249
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:18,756
   -You think there are still   
         vampires here?         

250
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:21,892
      -Vampire do not die.      

251
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:25,396
      They live for many,       
        many centuries.         

252
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:29,733
  -And you believe they still   
      sleep in the ruins?       

253
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,002
   -Stay away from the ruins.
