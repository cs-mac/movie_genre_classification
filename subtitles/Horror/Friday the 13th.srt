1
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:26,467
No!

2
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,907
Come here.
Come here now.

3
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:49,982
No.

4
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,526
You're the last one.

5
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:54,958
<i>I've killed all the others.</i>

6
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,600
It'll be easier for you than it was for Jason.

7
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,531
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

8
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:04,367
You need to be punished for what you did to him.

9
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,804
<i>- I didn't do anything.
- You let him drown.</i>

10
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:09,739
Jason was my son.

11
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,413
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

12
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:14,850
No. No.

13
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,218
<i>No. Please.</i>

14
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,319
You should have been watching him.

15
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:24,117
Every minute.

16
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:09,100
<i>Jason.</i>

17
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,442
<i>My special, special boy.</i>

18
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:23,513
<i>They must be punished, Jason, for what they did to you.</i>

19
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:25,716
<i>For what they did to me.</i>

20
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,252
<i>Kill for Mother.</i>

21
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,173
I'm serious.

22
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,830
You gotta watch out for mountain lions.
They're all over this place.

23
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:57,452
- Mountain lions?
- Yeah, we'll be fine. They're afraid of fire.

24
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:59,346
Dude, shut the fuck up.
I'm calling bullshit.

25
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:01,123
Richie's gonna call bullshit.

26
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:02,992
- Bullshit!
- Richie's calling bullshit.

27
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:04,993
- Guess what, I'm not bullshitting.
- Bullshit.

28
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,253
Okey, fine. You'll see when a mountain lion comes out...

29
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,961
- Dude, there's one right there!
- Nice try.

30
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,031
I am more afraid to be eaten by mosquitoes.

31
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:15,865
Hey, you wanna slap that ass one more time for Daddy?

32
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,803
- Did Daddy like that?
- Yeah, Daddy does like it. A lot.

33
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:22,937
Whitney? Where are you right now?

34
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,336
- I'm here.
- Are you?

35
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,347
I'm here. Right in the middle of nowhere.

36
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:31,850
- Hey, are you reading that right?
- I'm reading it right.

37
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:34,854
- Come on, Pizarro, let's go.
- Where are we going?

38
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:37,090
- These are heavy and it's hot.
- Where are we?

39
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,834
Dude, we are way the fuck off.

40
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,066
- No, we're not, act...
- Yes.

41
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,400
No, we're not. Not everything shows up on GPS, Richie.

42
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:53,407
There is a sign that said there was a mine around here.
Did that come up?

43
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,409
No. We're close, I think.

44
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:58,513
You think? Dude, you don't know how to use this thing.

45
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,482
It's almost dark.
Do you know where it is or not?

46
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,911
Look, I didn't plant this shit, Richie, okay?

47
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:06,221
I got this tip from a secondhand source.
We should be close. I have to smell it.

48
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,423
Look, we're gonna stop here.

49
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:11,986
Tomorrow morning, you and me, we get up
at dawn. We go, we find the crop.

50
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:15,157
We cut down as much as we can.
We ditch it in the truck.

51
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,122
- Back here before breakfast, okay?
- Hey.

52
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,598
- Guys. Guys.
- Nobody knows a thing.

53
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,938
We don't even need that thing. There's a perfect
spot right over here. It's already been cleared.

54
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,472
Perfect. We'll camp here.

55
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:29,369
Hey. Do you know how much money
we're gonna make selling this weed?

56
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:33,813
- We're ganna get a lot of fucking money.
- Yeah, okay? So listen to me. Relax.

57
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:35,441
- I am relax. You wanna know why?
- Why?

58
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:37,085
Cause I wanna be fucking rich.
You know what rich people do?

59
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,486
- What?
- They relax. You need to fucking relax.

60
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,352
- I need to relax?
- You need to relax.

61
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,668
Hey, guys. Guys.

62
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:59,037
I just found some broken-down cabins over there.
It's gotta be the old camp.

63
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,072
Who wants to go check it out?

64
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,337
Is this all we brought to drink?
No Heineken?

65
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:04,941
Fuck that Euro shit.

66
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:08,714
This is Pabst Blue American Ribbon, my friend.

67
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:12,218
You do realize this camp was closed down, like 20 years ago?

68
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:16,899
Some woman, she went fucking nuts.
Killed all these counselors.

69
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,427
Blamed them for her son's drowning.
He was like...

70
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:22,120
deformed or retarded or something.

71
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:23,690
Really?

72
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,532
Mom got hers.

73
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:29,366
Apparently there was one survivor.

74
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,200
This girl...

75
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,604
she cut that lady's head off with a machete.

76
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,176
It gets weirder.

77
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,075
I'm sure it does.

78
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:39,540
Her son...

79
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,611
Jason...

80
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,417
he came back.

81
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,056
He was actually there.

82
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,191
He watched his mom being beheaded.

83
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:57,889
Actually a friend of mine, he went to camp around here...

84
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,935
- Oh, jeez.
- He went to camp around here.

85
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,896
He said the cops came.
They were looking for that Jason guy.

86
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,996
All right, you know what?

87
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:07,400
- Don't believe me.
- Nobody does.

88
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,101
Don't believe me.

89
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:09,970
But I'm pretty sure, the way the story goes...

90
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:12,444
the place was called Camp Crystal Lake.

91
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:15,516
Do you know how many lakes are probably called Crystal Lake?

92
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:19,321
It's like Crystal Geyser, Crystal Water.
Go to a supermarket.

93
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:21,790
Every single bottle of water is "Crystal" something.

94
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,751
- Aquafina.
- The...

95
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,422
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

96
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:28,790
The story could have happened anywhere, dude.
It's that's how they get little kids to shit themselves.

97
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:31,558
- How's that beer, treat me a beer-snob?
- Better than my own piss.

98
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:35,566
You can drink that, by the way.
Yours, hers, hers, mine, yours. I swear, piss is sterile.

99
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,899
- For the record you will never drink my piss.
- That's what you think.

100
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:39,735
Exactly. What about me?

101
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:44,342
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Mm-hm.

102
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:47,813
I got marshmallow on my knee.

103
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,679
- Where you guys going?
- Go make out.

104
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:51,114
Oh, yeah?

105
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,686
- Hey, Mikey?
- Sweet.

106
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:53,913
Wear a condom.

107
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,487
An extra small one.

108
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:01,154
I get it, though, dude.
You do what you gotta do to survive, you know.

109
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,792
If we were all out here starving to death and you were dead...

110
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:07,230
I'd eat your leg.

111
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:09,667
- That's really sweet. Yeah.
- Thank you.

112
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:13,798
Why would you eat my leg, man?
I can teach you how to fish. Just go fishing.

113
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:15,904
I don't eat fish.

114
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,706
That's not what you told me.

115
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,556
Listen...

116
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,788
I don't think I'm gonna stay the whole time.

117
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:33,985
Did Wade's story scare you?

118
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,027
Please.

119
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,792
I just...

120
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:42,599
I don't feel right being here...

121
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:44,904
so far away from my mom.

122
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,735
Your mom was the one that told me
to get you out of town for a few days.

123
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,603
- Really?
- Yeah.

124
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:56,043
And she's in good hands.
She's got her nurse right there.

125
00:08:59,021 --> 00:08:59,981
Come on.

126
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:04,552
Have sex with your boyfriend in a cramped little tent.

127
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,595
We can get hammered, blow some chunks in the woods.

128
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,265
Then we can go back Monday and deal with whatever.

129
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,207
Hey.

130
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,311
I'm a fucking idiot.

131
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:26,846
Richie?

132
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:32,020
- The ephemeris data just didn't sync up.
- Oh, dude, that sucks.

133
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,122
Fucking right.

134
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,493
- Do you know what this means?
- I wanna...

135
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,491
What?

136
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,958
We're, like...
We're, like, a half mile away.

137
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,260
- Less.
- Shut up.

138
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:51,400
<i>You know what makes me happy, Richie?
Global positioning systems.</i>

139
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,331
GPS to the layperson.

140
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,030
<i>NASA technology in the palm of your hand.
Knows what this little fucker does?</i>

141
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,277
<i>This guy sends a signal up into outer space.</i>

142
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:03,675
<i>Signal.</i>

143
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,854
<i>Satellite gets it, turns it around.</i>

144
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,815
<i>It's like, "Oh, thank you, GPS. I'm gonna send a signal to you."</i>

145
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,693
<i>Back to the palm of your hand.
Technology, man.</i>

146
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,294
<i>It's fucking remarkable.</i>

147
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,760
It is un-fucking-believable.

148
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:22,268
Wade, you gotta bounce, dude.
Tell your dumb shit to somebody else.

149
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,469
Why, because I'm fucking teaching you something?

150
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,664
That's probably it.

151
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,940
Say, Richie, old buddy, I'm gonna bounce.

152
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,414
- You do that, brother. Okay.
- I'm spent.

153
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:39,180
May the Force be with your Schwartz.

154
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,188
You're in so much trouble.

155
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,658
Oh.

156
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,546
Fuck, yes.

157
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,091
I love you.

158
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:00,399
And you. And you.

159
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,704
I even love you.

160
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,330
Oh, my God. Look at this shit.

161
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,670
What the fuck? What the fuck?!

162
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:13,144
What's this? No, no! No! No!

163
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:20,019
That must be the camp that Wade was talking about.

164
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,021
- Let's check it out.
- No, I wanna go this way.

165
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:28,925
Come on.

166
00:12:29,398 --> 00:12:31,095
Come on.

167
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:46,943
Wow, look at that.

168
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,051
Mike, where are you going?

169
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:56,623
- Let's go inside.
- No.

170
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,022
- Where's your sense of adventure?
- Oh, come on.

171
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:00,992
Come on. What are you scared of?

172
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:02,824
No.

173
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,436
I am willing to bet there's some pretty cool shit in here.

174
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,649
Mike, don't go in there.
What if some homeless person lives here?

175
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:24,547
No homeless person lives here.

176
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:29,921
You hungry?

177
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,295
Wow.

178
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:49,572
Look at how old this shit is.

179
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,276
It's like it was dragged here from another century.

180
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:12,934
Check this out.

181
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:39,051
Hey. It looks like you.

182
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,989
- No, it doesn't.
- Yeah, it does.

183
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,858
It's cool, you should keep it.

184
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,418
It's a little kid's room.

185
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:21,534
Wasn't Jason the name from Wade's story?

186
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,262
- I wanna go.
- What?

187
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,270
- Like, right now.
- Oh, come on.

188
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:26,465
Please?

189
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,835
- You like that?
- Yeah. Wait for me. Wait for me.

190
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:33,000
- No, I think I'm gonna...
- Oh, no. Don't do that again.

191
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:34,779
- We'll do it at the same time.
- Hang on.

192
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,350
- I'm almost there.
- Shit. I heard something.

193
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,819
Stop it. Wait, I'm serious.

194
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,723
- What?
- I think Wade's watching us.

195
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,893
What?

196
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:48,220
Well, fuck it, let the perv watch.

197
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,365
Right?

198
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,093
Shit.

199
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,433
Wade.

200
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,572
Dude, if you're out there whacking off, man, that is not cool.

201
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,269
Come on, dude.

202
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:07,673
I think we're good.

203
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,351
- Don't come yet.
- No, no.

204
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:19,960
- Tell me when you want to.
- Wait.

205
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,620
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.

206
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,364
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

207
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:31,871
Okay.

208
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:39,140
Wade!

209
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:41,912
I'm gonna kill you.

210
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:49,949
Okay.

211
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,490
- Okay?
- Okay.

212
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,153
No, go get him.
Tell him to leave us alone.

213
00:16:57,232 --> 00:17:00,260
I'm not gonna go out there with a boner.

214
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,027
Well, you're not getting any until you do.

215
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:07,565
- Go.
- Do not move, okay?

216
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:35,927
Richie?

217
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,315
Richie, stop fucking around.

218
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,055
Wade.

219
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:04,796
Dude, you jump out from a tree, I'm gonna
punch you in your face, I shit you not.

220
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,800
Come on, man.
I gotta get back to the fucking tent.

221
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,074
Holy shit.

222
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,849
You fucking jerk, you found the weed.

223
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,193
Wade. Wade!

224
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,375
Wade. Wade.

225
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,184
Amanda!

226
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,795
Amanda! Goddamn!

227
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:17,737
Richie!

228
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:20,708
Fuck!

229
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:29,247
Richie!

230
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,385
Oh, God!

231
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:50,299
Cool.

232
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,582
Whitney, you've gotta see this.

233
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,691
Mike. Come on.

234
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,797
No, I'm serious. You've gotta see this.
Somebody's been here.

235
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:29,105
What is that?

236
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:30,802
There's something in there.

237
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,614
- Looks like some kind of a doll.
- Are you crazy?

238
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:43,847
Oh, my God! Ah!
- Ah!

239
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,263
There's something out there.

240
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:57,265
- Stay here.
- No.

241
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,720
Ah! Oh, my God!

242
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:22,923
Get away, get back!

243
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:24,890
Get off the floor!

244
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:29,133
- Get up!
- Mike!

245
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,295
Holy fuck!

246
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,440
- Ah!
- Mike!

247
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:39,511
- Mike. Mike, Mike, Mike.
- Get out!

248
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,515
- Mike. Mike, get up. Come on.
- Go!

249
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:07,866
Help me!

250
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:12,043
- Mike! Mike!
- Run.

251
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:15,413
Run! Run, Whitney!

252
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,235
Oh, my God.

253
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:42,737
Oh, God.

254
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,623
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

255
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:09,569
<i>Whitney! Whitney, help.
Whitney, please. Help!</i>

256
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:11,298
Whitney! Whitney.

257
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:13,338
<i>Whitney!</i>

258
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:21,142
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

259
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:24,580
Shit.

260
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,254
Come on. Shit.

261
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:38,389
Come on.

262
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:25,640
Oh, my God.
Babies have more space in the uterus.

263
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,578
Hey, Lawrence, how about a little help?

264
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,117
Dude, that's not a good look for you, man.
you ask the one black guy to pump the gas for you? Shit.

265
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,887
Okay. Nolan.

266
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:41,825
How about I pay, you pump?

267
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:45,366
Sure, man.
Hey, I give a wicked blow job too.

268
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:48,566
Okay, well, um, we'll try that out later.

269
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:56,743
Whoa. Hey, bro, that's... I have a heart murmur.
What are you doing?

270
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:02,947
- Thank you.
- Where'd you get a knapsack like that?

271
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:06,659
It was a present, actually.
But I'm looking for my sister.

272
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,120
She's gone missing, about a month and a half ago.

273
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:13,585
My parent's cabin is stocked.
You think you're actually gonna get laid?

274
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:16,060
Your parents do not have Combos or Funyuns.

275
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:18,722
And they definitely don't have Fritos.
And this is...

276
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,060
not for sex.

277
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,398
- What are you gonna use them for?
- It's an experiment.

278
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:27,434
Okay. So just get behind me.
I'm not gonna pay for that shit.

279
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:31,274
Would you mind if I maybe just put a flyer
in the window or something?

280
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:33,708
Oh, I heard about that. That's sad.

281
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:37,681
If it was up to me, you could wallpaper
the whole place with them...

282
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,844
but the owner makes the rules.

283
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,420
And he's a real:

284
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,049
Um...

285
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:50,460
Well, is he here? Maybe I could talk to him.
Maybe if he understands the situation...

286
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:51,929
Are you gonna buy something?

287
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,866
I mean, you've been up here for quite a while yapping, so...

288
00:25:57,606 --> 00:25:59,030
Sure. Yeah.

289
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,472
Thanks. So we have two waters and some gas.

290
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,974
Two waters and some gas.

291
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:06,876
Guess I'm an asshole.

292
00:26:09,851 --> 00:26:11,912
You okay, bro? Is everything good?

293
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,181
Yeah, everything's fine. Thanks.

294
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,817
But I'm not your bro.

295
00:26:16,724 --> 00:26:19,361
So you don't wanna be friends, after this?
You don't wanna hang out?

296
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:22,350
- Let it go, Trent.
- It's not me. This guy's being a dick.

297
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,426
Yeah, it's me. Obviously, I'm the one being a dick.

298
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,491
Sir, thank you very much anyways.

299
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:30,365
- Yep.
- I'm sorry.

300
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:33,233
Thank you.

301
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,245
Seat belts.

302
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,189
Welcome back, Clay.

303
00:27:28,797 --> 00:27:30,528
You mean that, Officer Bracke?

304
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,031
Son, I know you think we're not on your side...

305
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:36,568
that we're just a bunch of dumb country hicks out here.

306
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:40,939
I put two 10-year veterans on that case.

307
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:45,205
We did three dozen interviews and ran
a county-wide search for your sister.

308
00:27:45,714 --> 00:27:48,515
You know how many thousands of people disappear every year...

309
00:27:48,783 --> 00:27:50,810
even in this state alone?

310
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,788
But there's no evidence that anything happened to Whitney
Miller or any of those other kids at Crystal Lake.

311
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:59,651
There's no car, no witnesses.

312
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,193
Nothing.

313
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:07,296
One of those kids was her boyfriend, right?

314
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:09,293
Right.

315
00:28:09,837 --> 00:28:11,227
Well...

316
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:14,307
they probably just took off together.

317
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,141
Our mother just died of cancer.
Did I tell you that?

318
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:21,043
- No, sir.
- Well, she did.

319
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:24,181
She was sick for a long time...

320
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:28,520
and Whitney took care of her every single day.

321
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,425
And then my sister didn't show up for the funeral.

322
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:38,227
See, you just don't know my sister.
That's not possible.

323
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:39,859
Well...

324
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:42,270
she's not here, son.

325
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:47,537
You may wanna try looking someplace else.
That's what the other families are doing.

326
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,325
- Can you say that with a...?
- Wow.

327
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,217
<i>Can you say that with a little more hatred?</i>

328
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,295
- Nice.
- Shit.

329
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,969
Sir Lancelot, thank you.

330
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,128
- Oh, man down.
- Take it easy, guys.

331
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:20,501
Is anyone getting a signal out here?

332
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:24,343
Are you fucking with me right now?
I got business I gotta do this weekend.

333
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:25,507
What business?

334
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,614
Music. I'm trying to start a label.

335
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:29,877
Oh, yeah? Like what kind? Like rap?

336
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:33,115
Why you gotta go racial?

337
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:36,023
Look, don't put me in a box, all right?

338
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,955
What, because I'm black I can't listen to Green Day?

339
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,956
You're right, that was dumb.
So, what kind of music?

340
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,319
Rap.

341
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:51,798
Here it is.

342
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,900
- Oh, my God.
- Yep.

343
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:57,169
All right, we have two bedrooms upstairs.
We've got one down.

344
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:59,540
Someone can take the couch.
It's comfy as hell.

345
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:02,012
- Wow.
- Nice, huh?

346
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:04,378
- Damn.
- That is a fierce pussy.

347
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:06,820
It's actually a bobcat. It's my dad's first kill.

348
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:09,781
Dude, I didn't think this long-ass car ride was gonna be worth it...

349
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,721
but it's kind of worth it.

350
00:30:11,993 --> 00:30:13,383
This is bigger than the dorm.

351
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,428
What can I say?
Hey, take your feet off the table, please.

352
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,594
So make yourselves at home.

353
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,339
- What do you wanna do first?
- What do you wanna do?

354
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:29,139
Oh, well...

355
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,978
I brought Sweet Lucille.
I think you all need to meet her.

356
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,220
Lucille? Baby, is that you?

357
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,055
- Lawrence, you've been cheating.
- No.

358
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:46,591
- I saw you with a bowl the other night.
- No, you...

359
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:48,160
A bowl.

360
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,776
Hello?

361
00:31:11,018 --> 00:31:12,245
Hello?

362
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,584
Hello?

363
00:31:22,096 --> 00:31:22,990
Hello?

364
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:40,170
Christ.

365
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,620
- I just wanted to ask you a question.
- Hush.

366
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:59,127
I wanted to ask you if maybe you've seen somebody.

367
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,093
My sister.

368
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:04,797
She came camping up around here with some friends...

369
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,964
and she's gone missing.

370
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,261
She ain't missing.

371
00:32:10,485 --> 00:32:11,262
She's dead.

372
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,085
What?

373
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,175
People go missing around here they're gone for good.

374
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:20,115
Outsiders come, they don't know where to walk.

375
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:21,521
They bring trouble.

376
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:23,616
We just wanna be left alone.

377
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:25,388
And so does he.

378
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,291
So does who?

379
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:33,364
Ma'am, please. So does who?

380
00:32:42,977 --> 00:32:46,313
- You, baby. It's all you.
- Stop peer-pressuring me.

381
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,718
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit.

382
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,518
- Yes!
- My fucking eye!

383
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:03,323
Guys, watch the floor, all right, please?
That's stained oak.

384
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:07,332
- This is an outside game. Come on.
- Wait, I got foam in my contact.

385
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,272
Hey. This is a great spot.

386
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:18,802
Do you wanna go for a hike?
Get some exercise?

387
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,007
That'd be nice, but, well, I can't exactly leave them here alone.

388
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:25,017
What are you talking about?

389
00:33:27,488 --> 00:33:29,652
Have you seen what they're doing inside?

390
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,519
Crazy. Some drunken hoodlums.

391
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,620
- Hoodlums?
- Hoodlums.

392
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,990
What do you think they're gonna do?

393
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:40,293
- I mean, steal the deer head?
- You're right.

394
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,960
How are they gonna pull off the getaway?
We're all leaving in the same car.

395
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:45,867
Come on. Do you want some exercise?

396
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,409
Because I have this really great move that I've been practicing...

397
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,642
and I need someone to practice it with.

398
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:54,782
Very charming. Very charming.

399
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:56,610
Oh, come on.

400
00:33:57,885 --> 00:34:00,212
- I'll go on a hike. You wanna go on a hike?
- Yeah, you like hikes now?

401
00:34:00,213 --> 00:34:01,888
- I love hikes.
- I knew it.

402
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:03,887
Will you get me a beer?

403
00:34:35,957 --> 00:34:37,552
Excuse me.

404
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:44,721
Sir?

405
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:47,894
- Hey!
- Oh, shit. Jesus.

406
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:53,439
Sorry.

407
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,243
Jesus Christ.

408
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,713
You're fucking lucky there, stretch.

409
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:03,450
Came that close to hitting the start button
on the whoop-ass machine, boy.

410
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:08,478
Look, I didn't mean to startle you.
I was trying to get your attention.

411
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:10,920
This is Mr. Garikes' property.

412
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:14,926
You're lucky that old mummy fart didn't come
out of here and put buckshots in your ass.

413
00:35:15,396 --> 00:35:17,929
Somebody has been stealing his fucking kerosene too.

414
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:21,028
Look, I just came in here to ask you something, okay?

415
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:23,602
I'm looking for this girl.
Have you seen her?

416
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,636
She's been missing for about a month.

417
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,638
I wish I had, man.

418
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,770
- I ain't seen her, though.
- Thanks.

419
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,513
- Take care.
- You too.

420
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,743
Shit. Hey, hey, hey.

421
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:39,819
I forgot, did you wanna buy some weed?

422
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:44,219
Seriously, I found a fucking shit ton of it
growing out there. A little bushel.

423
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:46,724
- Sell you some.
- No. Thanks.

424
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:49,362
- You sure? I got a whole bunch of it.
- I'm good.

425
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,622
You sure?

426
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,857
It's your fucking loss, dude.

427
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:55,594
It'll fuck your shit up, boy.

428
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,267
Good times...

429
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,462
fucker.

430
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,900
Just relax, okay?
These guys are your guests.

431
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,771
If you're...

432
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:08,438
If you're not comfortable having them here,
then why did you invite them?

433
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,447
So they could admire your place?

434
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,713
No. I just wanted to have a good weekend. You know?

435
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:18,854
Hey, guys. Wanna check out the other side of the lake with us?

436
00:36:21,028 --> 00:36:24,022
Um... You know what?
It's getting, you know...

437
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:28,157
No. That's okay. It's...
It's okay. It's getting kind of late.

438
00:36:28,536 --> 00:36:29,460
- Yeah.
- Okay.

439
00:36:29,737 --> 00:36:30,729
Take my truck.

440
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,569
- Nice.
- I trust you.

441
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:36,910
And can you do me a favor?
Will you take the gas cans to the boat?

442
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:40,212
It's on the south end of the lake.
Just take a right onto Town Road.

443
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:41,905
- Take a right.
- Okay, and then?

444
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:44,347
Why don't you just type "boat" into the nav?

445
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,918
- Technology, right?
- See you.

446
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:49,022
- Have fun.
- Later.

447
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,086
Don't drive my boat.

448
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:55,525
I'm the only one that drives the boat, okay?

449
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,320
Aye, aye, captain.

450
00:36:57,598 --> 00:36:58,726
Damn straight.

451
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,832
What does that say about me
that the second Trent said...

452
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:08,908
"Don't take my boat out," it was guaranteed that I would.

453
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:10,805
It means you're a sociopath.

454
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:14,072
Now, what does it say about me that I find that hot?

455
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:23,323
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for my sister and...

456
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,182
Hey.

457
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,129
- No luck?
- No. No, not yet.

458
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,427
- May I?
- Yeah.

459
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,263
- Thank you.
- Sure.

460
00:37:36,937 --> 00:37:37,995
She's pretty.

461
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:42,132
Thanks.

462
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:44,777
Do you wanna come in for a second, grab a drink?

463
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,269
Uh...

464
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:50,106
I don't think your boyfriend would like that too much.

465
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:51,908
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

466
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,179
And here we have the stoned
American male, foraging for food.

467
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:58,948
Thanks.

468
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:06,397
This should be interesting.

469
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:10,693
Hey, Trent, you remember...

470
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:13,063
Clay.

471
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,177
Yeah. Of course I remember Clay.

472
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:18,773
Why is he in my house?

473
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,976
Hey, new guy. Beer?

474
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:26,813
No, no. He's gotta get going.
You got flyers to pass out, right?

475
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,511
Yeah.

476
00:38:29,156 --> 00:38:30,250
Right.

477
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:33,052
- Look, if you're hungry, we...
- Okay.

478
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:37,425
Look, Clay, obviously she's just trying to be nice.

479
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:41,231
But you can't stay here.
No offense, but this is a private party.

480
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:43,332
- I don't know you.
- No, you don't know me.

481
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:45,740
That's so funny, I just said that.

482
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,970
Like two seconds ago, that I don't know you.

483
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,634
I would probably leave soon before
I get pissed off and, you know...

484
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,905
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

485
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:55,375
What happens then?

486
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:59,541
Hey, look. Take it easy, Trent, all right?
I'll just... I'll walk you out.

487
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:00,886
Yeah.

488
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:04,315
Jenna. Jenna, come on.
Where you going?

489
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:13,458
Sorry about that.

490
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:16,467
That's all right.
It's his house, you know?

491
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:17,865
Where's your car?

492
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:20,700
I do not have a car,
but I do have her.

493
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:22,801
- Nice.
- Thanks.

494
00:39:23,077 --> 00:39:26,674
- This thing runs?
- Yeah. Yeah, it runs.

495
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,140
So where you off to next?

496
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:33,143
Well I haven't been to the other side of the lake, You had saw
so I was probably gonna go check that out, you know.

497
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,290
- Do you want some company?
- I'd love some company.

498
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:06,145
What's up, beaver bear?

499
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,587
It's a big motherfucker, huh?

500
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,267
Fuck, yeah.

501
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:32,703
You hot bitch.

502
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:39,344
Let Daddy have a little lick.

503
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:47,116
You like that, bitch? You know you do.

504
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:53,625
What the fuck was that?

505
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,668
Don't smoke my weed, motherfucker.

506
00:41:01,842 --> 00:41:04,939
Somebody better not be stealing the kerosene up there.

507
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:31,763
Shit.

508
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,406
Gina.

509
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:12,207
It's just you, baby.

510
00:42:14,081 --> 00:42:16,142
It's been a long time, Gina.

511
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:18,945
You remember that special night we had?

512
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,315
You remember when you took my virginity?

513
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:22,813
You're sexy.

514
00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:27,185
You're still tight as ever.
I'm gonna fucking pound you so hard.

515
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:29,459
What the fuck?

516
00:42:40,441 --> 00:42:41,365
What the...?

517
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,204
That shit ain't fucking right, dude.
What the fuck?

518
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,626
I don't know, you really think we should take the boat out?
I mean he's gonna find out.

519
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:37,088
- I knew it.
- What?

520
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:41,701
You're inhibited. You talk a big game,
but inside you're just a scared little girl.

521
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,469
Oh, really? Oh, okay, fine.

522
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:47,607
You wanna find out who's really scared? Let's do it.

523
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:50,471
All right. Let's go.

524
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,411
So you and your sister must be pretty close.

525
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:59,386
Yeah. We were pretty close when we were younger.
We kind of drifted.

526
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:03,555
You know, I mean, I bailed when I was 17,
and she stayed with my mom.

527
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,100
She kind of had to, I guess.

528
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:09,353
I don't know, she's always been the responsible one.

529
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:13,899
So when's the last time you talked to her?

530
00:44:14,702 --> 00:44:18,800
About six months ago.
We got in a fight, actually.

531
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,966
She called and said she wanted to see me,
said she was counting on me...

532
00:44:23,343 --> 00:44:24,667
and I never showed.

533
00:44:25,145 --> 00:44:26,506
Excuse me.

534
00:44:29,816 --> 00:44:31,043
What is that?

535
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,015
It's a GPS.

536
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:50,729
- All right, you ready?
- Ready. Let's do it.

537
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:58,074
Yeah. Oh, shit.

538
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:05,549
Yeah.

539
00:45:11,658 --> 00:45:12,655
Yeah.

540
00:45:18,332 --> 00:45:19,226
Pick it, pick it.

541
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,001
Oh, you like that, you like the balls in your hand, huh?

542
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:23,661
Which one? Which one is it?
Is that the one?

543
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:26,335
- Those feel good, don't they?
- That's the one.

544
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:27,672
Shoot.

545
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:32,278
Fuck.

546
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:34,778
One of you has gotta shoot the boot.

547
00:45:35,716 --> 00:45:36,983
That's you, babe.
That's you.

548
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:38,384
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

549
00:45:38,385 --> 00:45:40,953
You missed the shot.
I've been carrying you the entire game.

550
00:45:40,954 --> 00:45:42,915
- Come on, baby.
- Drink up, drink up, drink up.

551
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:47,493
<i>Shoot the boot, shoot the boot,
shoot the boot.</i>

552
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,221
Shoot the boot.

553
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,733
Fuck that. I'm not drinking out of your sweaty-ass sneaker.
You are not wearing socks, dude.

554
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:55,329
You lost 10 in a row. Shoot the boot.

555
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:58,202
My house, my rules.
I'm not drinking that shit.

556
00:45:58,272 --> 00:45:59,903
- Fine.
- Oh, no.

557
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:02,838
- To all the felching...
- No. No.

558
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,443
- welching...
- Yes.

559
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:06,841
pussies of the world.

560
00:46:08,915 --> 00:46:10,879
That's disgusting.

561
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:27,625
Oh!

562
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:42,048
Yeah.

563
00:46:50,257 --> 00:46:51,788
What are you doing, Nolan?!

564
00:47:01,535 --> 00:47:02,766
Nolan!

565
00:47:05,972 --> 00:47:09,433
Nolan. Oh, my God.

566
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:15,412
Nolan.

567
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:17,645
Oh, God. Oh, God.

568
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,445
Nolan?

569
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:24,047
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

570
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:34,828
What do you want from me?

571
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:36,560
Oh, my God.

572
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:14,652
- I never liked camp.
- Why?

573
00:48:15,662 --> 00:48:19,992
Bad food, bugs, cheap toilet paper.

574
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,373
Know what? Stay. Maybe we should
check these cabins out, you know?

575
00:48:30,743 --> 00:48:32,743
- Sure.
- Come on.

576
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:52,791
Let's just check out this last cabin, then we'll head back.

577
00:50:06,205 --> 00:50:07,629
Come on.

578
00:50:56,922 --> 00:50:58,517
You really should call the police.

579
00:50:58,691 --> 00:51:01,458
Yeah, I've already called the police.
You know, they're not looking for her anymore.

580
00:51:01,627 --> 00:51:03,524
No one is, except for me.

581
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:05,590
Then they should look harder because...

582
00:51:05,765 --> 00:51:07,189
Oh! Ow.

583
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:09,534
- You all right?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

584
00:51:09,836 --> 00:51:11,763
- You sure?
- Yeah.

585
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:17,771
Let's get out of here.

586
00:51:20,013 --> 00:51:21,308
Watch your step.

587
00:51:32,658 --> 00:51:35,659
Give me a sec, I gotta change out my batteries.

588
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:42,791
- Someone's coming.
- Oh, shit. Let's go.

589
00:51:54,013 --> 00:51:55,444
Oh, my God.

590
00:53:22,201 --> 00:53:24,030
Where's he going?

591
00:53:30,776 --> 00:53:33,611
- Oh, my God. We gotta go.
- Shh.

592
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:35,870
- I gotta follow him.
- He had a dead body.

593
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:38,981
- We gotta go. We gotta warn my friends.
- Okay, okay.

594
00:54:13,419 --> 00:54:15,749
- You okay?
- Yeah.

595
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:17,479
What is that?

596
00:54:20,459 --> 00:54:22,044
Help!

597
00:54:25,598 --> 00:54:26,422
Come on, let's go.

598
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:27,698
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

599
00:54:27,967 --> 00:54:30,130
Help me!

600
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,177
<i>Help me!</i>

601
00:54:46,352 --> 00:54:48,543
<i>Help!</i>

602
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:54,252
<i>Help me!</i>

603
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:30,950
No. No.

604
00:57:12,631 --> 00:57:14,062
Please don't hurt me.

605
00:57:21,173 --> 00:57:23,138
It's okay.

606
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:27,970
Jason.

607
00:57:28,047 --> 00:57:30,047
It's okay.

608
00:58:11,123 --> 00:58:13,086
Clay.

609
00:58:25,104 --> 00:58:26,933
Shit.

610
00:58:49,228 --> 00:58:50,350
Come on.

611
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:08,438
Shit.

612
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,158
- This way. Come on.
- Okay.

613
01:01:22,515 --> 01:01:24,306
In my next life...

614
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:27,212
I wanna come back as...

615
01:01:27,486 --> 01:01:31,378
one of the buttons on the ass pocket of her jean shorts.

616
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:36,193
- Just go over there and fucking talk to her.
- Are you kidding me?

617
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:40,125
I have a better shot at fucking a penguin than that girl.

618
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:50,005
- Let's light this bad boy.
- Great.

619
01:01:53,145 --> 01:01:54,440
Here we go.

620
01:01:56,682 --> 01:01:57,582
Yes.

621
01:01:57,816 --> 01:01:58,816
<i>Hey.</i>

622
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:03,112
Here's to Daddy's shoes and fucking douche bags.

623
01:02:03,188 --> 01:02:06,951
- Let's just all be one big happy cliché.
- Yes.

624
01:02:07,026 --> 01:02:10,994
Dude, what the fuck?
Please, try not to burn down my house.

625
01:02:13,932 --> 01:02:16,293
Did you forget how to drink that?

626
01:02:19,371 --> 01:02:21,032
Just bring it to your lips...

627
01:02:22,574 --> 01:02:24,135
blow...

628
01:02:25,544 --> 01:02:27,339
and suck.

629
01:02:28,313 --> 01:02:31,243
- You're really good at that.
- Mm-hm.

630
01:02:36,989 --> 01:02:39,851
Fuck, dude!
You just broke my dad's fucking chair.

631
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:41,117
My fucking lip, man.

632
01:02:41,193 --> 01:02:44,426
I don't care about your fucking lip.
This is a family heirloom.

633
01:02:44,496 --> 01:02:47,731
- Oh, shit. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- Fuck!

634
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,401
I just... No, I can fix this.
I just need some tools.

635
01:02:50,669 --> 01:02:53,670
- He can fix it.
- You know, you better pull some MacGyver shit.

636
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,337
All right, go to the toolshed.
It's down the path.

637
01:02:56,975 --> 01:02:59,175
Yeah, okay. I'm just... Trent, I'm sorry, man.

638
01:02:59,345 --> 01:03:00,978
You won't be disappointed.

639
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:05,860
- They don't call me "wood wizard" because I masturbate a lot.
- Grab a flashlight, you fucking idiot.

640
01:03:06,885 --> 01:03:08,077
Thanks.

641
01:03:10,422 --> 01:03:12,549
Forget about it. He'll fix it.

642
01:03:12,725 --> 01:03:14,925
Let's go finish this.

643
01:03:21,366 --> 01:03:24,128
That's a ugly fucking chair anyway.

644
01:03:24,503 --> 01:03:28,900
Hi. My name is Trent. My daddy bent me over this chair
and beat me when I was little, so you need to fix it.

645
01:03:38,817 --> 01:03:40,148
Hey, now.

646
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:43,147
Yes.

647
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:54,058
You people are rich.

648
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,699
Holy crap.

649
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,969
Poor people call this a house. Jesus Christ.

650
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:10,412
You have never used this shit.

651
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,077
Fucking douche bag.
Skis. What the fuck?

652
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:21,287
Ha! Ha!

653
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:25,355
"Lagavulin, product of Scotland."

654
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,593
Oh.

655
01:04:27,764 --> 01:04:30,030
That just smells like money.

656
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,097
I knew there was a reason to be your friend, Trent.

657
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:41,705
More? Oh, absolutely. No...
All right, you don't have to force it on me.

658
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:44,537
Fuck.

659
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,848
You can grease wheels with this shit.

660
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,251
That's payment for being a douche bag.

661
01:04:52,689 --> 01:04:53,917
Okay.

662
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,562
Okay.

663
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:03,559
Okay.

664
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,798
Oh, yeah.

665
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:09,202
Oh, wow. Your tits are stupendous.

666
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,334
Wow, you really know how to make a girl feel special, huh?

667
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,476
That's what I do.

668
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:22,112
Yeah, they can go. Take off my pants.

669
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:23,809
They can go.

670
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,467
Oh, man.

671
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:42,736
All right. Let's see what you've got.

672
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:47,836
All right, give me something, baby.
What you got for me? Give me something.

673
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,807
Goddamn. Not even a swimsuit? Shit.

674
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:53,341
Goddamn winter catalog.

675
01:05:54,217 --> 01:05:55,245
Oh, okay.

676
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,348
Gonna have to do.

677
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:07,588
Lady, I'm about to ruin your perfect day.

678
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,439
All right.

679
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,709
Shit. You scared the piss out of me.

680
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:25,314
Where is everybody? There's a guy out
there carrying a dead body.

681
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:26,912
Jenna, where's the phone?

682
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,744
I... I don't know. Over there?

683
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,193
You fucking with me because I'm high?

684
01:06:30,294 --> 01:06:32,733
That's totally not cool becuase I just
finished fucking smoking, okey.

685
01:06:32,734 --> 01:06:33,610
Where's the phone?

686
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,661
Hi, I want to report a homicide.

687
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:40,820
Clay Miller.

688
01:06:40,921 --> 01:06:43,532
Yeah, I'm at a house by Crystal Lake. It's...

689
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,491
Yeah, that's it. Hurry.

690
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,599
They said they're sending someone.

691
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,295
- Police?
- Yeah.

692
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,370
- Where is everybody else?
- I don't know. I've been here all day.

693
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,050
Chelsea and Nolan left, like, hours ago.
They went to the lake or some shit.

694
01:06:56,151 --> 01:06:58,947
- Well, what about Trent? Bree?
- They're in the bedroom.

695
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:06,678
- Your tits are fucking just...
- I know.

696
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,153
so juicy, dude.

697
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:12,727
You got perfect nipple placement, baby.

698
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,962
This better not go on the fucking Internet.

699
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:23,997
These would win in a fucking titty contest.

700
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,310
Trent, Bree. You guys in there?

701
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,151
<i>Trent! Bree!</i>

702
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:40,812
Shut the fuck up!

703
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,016
Get out here!

704
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:45,552
They're just fucking with us.

705
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:49,994
- Ignore her.
- Come on, guys.

706
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,993
Get out here. There's a guy out there.

707
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:56,031
- We're busy in here, baby.
- Trent.

708
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:31,931
Yeah.

709
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:35,239
Okay. All right, Trent.
Let me educate you.

710
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:39,881
You ever seen a crossover before, huh?
I'm gonna show you right now.

711
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,877
I'll bet you never...
Whoa. Ow.

712
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,452
Jesus.

713
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:52,651
Hey.

714
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:55,363
Now, this is a man's sport.

715
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:59,965
You're even curved to the left, like my penis.

716
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:03,899
Okay, it's overtime. Line change.

717
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:05,901
Chewie's on the ice.

718
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:10,268
Send the puck around the back of the net.
Here we go. Pass back to the middle. Oh!

719
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:15,442
Oh, my...

720
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,711
No, no, no.

721
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:21,834
Shit.

722
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:27,193
Shit.

723
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:40,205
Oh, God. You scared the shit out of me, bro.

724
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,239
Are you looking for this?

725
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:48,473
Because it completes your outfit.

726
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,215
Oh, fuck.

727
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,991
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus.

728
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,237
No.

729
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:10,992
Oh, my God, baby. Getting close.

730
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,360
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

731
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,159
I got aboat eight seconds, then I'm going.

732
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:18,240
Oh, God.

733
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,445
Oh, God.

734
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:37,687
I'm going soon. I'm going.

735
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,262
No.

736
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,811
That was...

737
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,050
Stupendous?

738
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,282
To say the least, yeah.

739
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:19,593
- Who's messing with the lights?
- Oh, shit. Chewie's still out there.

740
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,025
Phone's dead.

741
01:12:21,026 --> 01:12:23,572
- Jenna, do you have a cell? Do you have anything?
- No, nothing has a signal.

742
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:24,635
What the fuck are you doing here?

743
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,565
- Trent...
- Get the fuck out of here, buddy.

744
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,767
- Easy.
- He's just trying to help us.

745
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:33,444
You leave with this guy for eight hours,
fucking all over the woods?

746
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:36,617
You know what? Why don't both of you just get the fuck out?

747
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:38,854
- Listen dump shit there's a bigger problem...
- Shut up.

748
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,187
Are you serious?
There is a killer out there.

749
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:42,681
He's the one who cut the lights, okay.

750
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:46,486
Trent, don't you get it?
Chelsea and Nolan never came back.

751
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,096
Lawrence, what are you doing?

752
01:12:48,464 --> 01:12:50,960
My boy's still out there.
I'm gonna go get him.

753
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:53,130
No, look man. Don't go out there. Please.

754
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:56,336
Look, I told, all right?
You can't get a handle on me.

755
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:58,764
I'll surprise you every time.

756
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:28,393
Chewie?

757
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,340
Hey, Chewie?

758
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,118
Chew, you in there?

759
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,248
Chewie?

760
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,745
Chewie, you in here?

761
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:23,310
Oh, fuck.

762
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:34,293
Get the fuck off me.

763
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:42,734
Take that, motherfucker.

764
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:09,139
Guys, this is bullshit.

765
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,400
All right, The power goes out here all the time.

766
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,297
<i>Help me!</i>

767
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,467
Help! Help me!

768
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:22,167
<i>Please, help me.</i>

769
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,906
- Lawrence.
- No, no, no. You can't go out there.

770
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,900
- We have to help him.
- No, we can't, okay.

771
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:29,947
He's using your friend as bait.
He wants us to go out there.

772
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:31,811
Well, you don't know that.

773
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,348
Jesus, where are the police?

774
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:35,346
<i>I can't move.</i>

775
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:37,652
<i>- Help me!
- We have to help him.</i>

776
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,321
<i>I can't die like this.</i>

777
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,722
<i>Help me, please. Trent.</i>

778
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:45,163
Somebody, help.

779
01:16:45,668 --> 01:16:46,996
Oh, my God, please.

780
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,362
<i>I can't fucking...</i>

781
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,697
Somebody's gotta do something!

782
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,300
Please.

783
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,216
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

784
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:25,198
Everyone's gonna be okay, all right?
The cops are on their way.

785
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:30,142
What are you doing?

786
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,888
Trent.

787
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:20,111
Jenna?

788
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,614
Police.

789
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:32,722
- Oh, thank God.
- Go, go.

790
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,192
Police, open up.

791
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:43,401
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Go, go, go.
- Oh, my God.

792
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:52,278
Get the door.

793
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:54,074
Okay. Shit.

794
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:57,309
- What are you doing? Is he inside the house?
- He killed the cop.

795
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,856
What the fuck, you got a gun?
Let's go now.

796
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,917
Jesus! What are you doing?

797
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,462
Give me the gun.

798
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:10,455
Someone's in there.

799
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,628
Check it out.

800
01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:32,548
Bree's dead. He killed Bree.

801
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,961
Come on.

802
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:45,397
Come on.

803
01:21:46,335 --> 01:21:49,197
There's no gun, no keys, nothing.
Let's go.

804
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:57,406
Where are the keys?

805
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:04,717
- Help! We got officers down.
- My keys are gone. Where are my keys?

806
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:07,512
Hey, Jenna, fuck this guy.
Let's get out of here.

807
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:16,061
Go. Go. Go, go, go! Jesus.

808
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:28,169
Oh, my God.

809
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:59,630
Shit. Where the fuck are you, gun?

810
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:01,807
Fuck.

811
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,949
Fuck it.

812
01:24:57,526 --> 01:25:00,424
- Oh, my God, that's... that's Chelsea.
- We gotta keep moving. Go.

813
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,541
All right, this way.

814
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:18,913
- Come on.

815
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,321
Help!

816
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:42,527
Shh.

817
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,424
- Who was that?
- Let me out!

818
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:46,427
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck?

819
01:26:49,171 --> 01:26:51,398
Help me!

820
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:53,097
Help me.

821
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,171
This way.

822
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:24,830
- Clay?
- Whitney. Whitney.

823
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:27,430
- Oh, God, Clay.
- Thank God.

824
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:29,997
Are you okay? You okay? Thank God.

825
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:32,096
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:35,372
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay. You're okay?

827
01:28:35,744 --> 01:28:37,175
Oh, God.

828
01:28:37,746 --> 01:28:39,441
- Okay.
- Yeah, just get me out of here.

829
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:40,847
Fuck.

830
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,707
- Come on, you guys, let's go.
- Can you break it?

831
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:46,076
- No, just break it, just break it.
- Okay.

832
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:49,455
Yeah, just go. Go. Just fucking do it.

833
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:52,115
- Hold still. Hold your hands.
- Okay. Hurry up, hurry.

834
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:53,886
Do it. Fucking do it.

835
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:59,734
- We gotta get out of here.
- I don't wanna hit you.

836
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:02,128
- Just go. Just fucking do it.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

837
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:03,327
Hurry.

838
01:29:05,874 --> 01:29:07,164
Oh, God.

839
01:29:12,814 --> 01:29:14,241
Holy shit.

840
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,043
Okay, okay, okay.

841
01:29:16,785 --> 01:29:18,778
You guys, I can see him. He's coming.

842
01:29:19,054 --> 01:29:20,053

843
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:23,116

Go. Go.

847
01:29:57,826 --> 01:29:58,957
It's a dead end.

848
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:00,860
What are we gonna do?

849
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,358
Clay?

850
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:04,829

Come on, we can get through here.

Follow me.

854

Give me your hand, Jenna.

All right. Let's go. Come on. Hurry.

Shit, fuck.

It's okay.

01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,171
You can stop now.

887
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:49,872
It's okay.

888
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:04,582
Jason.

889
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,510
Say hi to Mommy...
