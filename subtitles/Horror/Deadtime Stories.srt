1
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,092
Get in that bed!

2
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,836
It's too dark, I can't sleep.

3
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,010
Brian, do you know
what time it is?

4
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,350
But there's a monster in
here and he wants to get me.

5
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,887
If you don't lie down
right now I'm gonna getcha!

6
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,141
Come on there.

7
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,234
Uncle Mike?

8
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,691
Sometimes mommy tells me a
story, will you tell me one?

9
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,242
No, not right now, Brian.

10
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,237
I hafta press the cat
and vacuum the ceiling.

11
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,620
Maybe later.

12
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,116
Oh please, just one?

13
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,079
Brian.

14
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,408
Please?

15
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,625
All right,
any story in particular?

16
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,996
Three little pigs?

17
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,302
Jack and the beanstalk?

18
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,215
I don't care.

19
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,554
Um, puss in boots?

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,050
Rumpelstiltskin?

21
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,601
Whatever.

22
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,684
Princess and the pea?

23
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,640
Ugly duckling?

24
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,229
Sleeping beauty?

25
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,434
If you like.

26
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,562
Brian, what story?

27
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,401
Hmm, why don't you make one up?

28
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,068
Alright.

<i>a1 remembering our

86
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:49,677
um, once upon a time,
a long, long time ago.

87
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,345
There was a Fisherman's
son named Peter.

88
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,611
He was all alone in the world.

89
00:05:56,815 --> 00:06:00,025
So it came to pass,
since he had no money,

90
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,985
he sold into slavery.

91
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,315
Bought by two evil witches.

92
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,820
So then, one day...

93
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:24,967
Good?

94
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,762
You bet it is!

95
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,023
Does my heart good
to see a handsome lad

96
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,765
enjoy my cooking.

97
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,270
The secret is baby slugs.

98
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,482
The big ones are too chewy!

99
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,823
You have to wait for
the really rainy days.

100
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,577
But you are worth it.

101
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,204
You're making me sick!

102
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,663
(Get up, b0)!-

103
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,923
there's work to be done.

104
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,205
You go to the village,
find the local parson.

105
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,381
If I'm not wrong
he fancies himself.

106
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,181
Thinks he's quite a ladies' man.

107
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,675
Are you listening to me, boy?

108
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,061
Tell him you know
two lovely ladies

109
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,847
who are just dying to meet him.

110
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,862
And you lead him here.

111
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,234
What lovely ladies?

112
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Never you mind.

113
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,071
Make sure he has a sip of that.

114
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,945
Leave the rest to me.

115
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,167
<i>You wouldn't be
tricking me now, would you boy?</i>

116
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,036
<i>They are beautiful?
Hmm?</i>

117
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,166
Aye. That they are.

118
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,091
<i>They got all their teeth?</i>

119
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,929
<i>Can't kiss a tart with
rotten teeth, you know.</i>

120
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,886
I would suppose.

121
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,228
Are they, are they sassy?

122
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,939
You know...

123
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,144
Sassy!

124
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,526
Sassy.

125
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,374
Boy, what'd you say
your name was again?

126
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,702
Peter.

127
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,834
Do I see you in my church?

128
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,758
They're almost here.

129
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,014
Well, get ready.

130
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,606
It's alright, boy.

131
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,186
I can find my way.

132
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,199
Where's my sassy?

133
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,662
Grand!

134
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,963
I bet you ladies have never

135
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,973
had such a prominent
man as I, huh?

136
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,721
Mmmmm.

137
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,237
You little vixens!

138
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,699
It's a bit of bondage, eh?

139
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,087
Oh yeah.

140
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,347
Has the lad told 'ya

141
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,612
that I have the largest
parsonage in the district?

142
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,687
And my flock of Norman.

143
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,112
They pray to me, you know.

144
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,813
So that's what you're up to.

145
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:45,476
And squeak!

146
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,687
(Flaughs)

147
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,567
What is this stuff anyway?

148
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,525
It's gettin'...

149
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,525
Get this stuff off of me!

150
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,024
Here we are.

151
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:28,265
Take the divine left hand
from a holy man.

152
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,939
The one that mirrors his heart.

153
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,939
Well ain't nothin' holy
about that one.

154
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:34,782
Shhhh!

155
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,026
Pay attention.

156
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,868
Brain of a black cat,
heart of an eel.

157
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,252
Grind them together
until they congeal.

158
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:49,996
Brain of a black cat,
brain of a black cat.

159
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,800
Black cat, heart.

160
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:53,804
What was it?

161
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,415
Heart of a weasel?

162
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,052
No no fat 0l' fool,
an eel, an eel!

163
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,549
I'm not fat!

164
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,600
You're not fat.

165
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,849
Eel.

166
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,059
Eel?

167
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,638
No eel!

168
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,311
Here we are!

169
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,856
Now grind them together and...

170
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,857
I know, I know!

171
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,659
There, that looks
pretty congealed!

172
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,617
Now pour in a vial
of hemlock and ale.

173
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,621
And top it all off with
a black piggie's tale.

174
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,843
Oh how sweet.

175
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,257
Now, my friend,

176
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,773
guide us true.

177
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,557
Where's our sister?

178
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,191
Where's magoga?

179
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,569
West?

180
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,199
The paupers' field.

181
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,697
<i>Peter, come along!</i>

182
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,324
Stop playin' with the nice man.

183
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,209
What have I told you about
talkin' to strangers?

184
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,423
Is this it?

185
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,262
Did we find her?

186
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,467
Shhh!

187
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,552
Quiet!

188
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,390
Quiet!

189
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,388
What is it, hanagohl?

190
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,271
She's here.

191
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,485
She's here!

192
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,222
Get out the way!

193
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,063
Do you mind?

194
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,294
Where is she?

195
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,496
Magoga.

196
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,625
What have they done to you?

197
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,495
<i>Why did you wait so long</i>

198
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,999
to dig your sister
magoga up anyway?

199
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,877
This one asks
too many questions.

200
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,004
Ahh there's no harm.

201
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,381
You see, Peter, the
spell to bring her back

202
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,129
can only be cast when the
full moon and the solstice

203
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,973
come together on Friday.

204
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,889
Once every 36 years.

205
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,099
37.

206
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,768
37?

207
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,936
Are you sure?

208
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,562
No, I've spent the last
28 years followin' it out.

209
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,404
Of course I'm sure, stupid.

210
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,951
I'm not stupid!

211
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,914
You are stupid,
mother always said so.

212
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,366
Mother always liked you best.

213
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,907
Mother was a good woman.

214
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,170
Nasty woman, she was.

215
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,015
Ls that it? Are we ready?

216
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:24,724
No, there's one last
ingredient to be got.

217
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,279
This is your busy day, boy.

218
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,485
Your hair, too.

219
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,699
Can't lure the sorta girl we
need if you're all a mess.

220
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,037
Remember, squeaky clean!

221
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,956
Here, maybe I better help you.

222
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,209
No, no no no, florinda.

223
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,421
I can do it.

224
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,309
Can I have my clothes now?

225
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,517
Please, now?

226
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,356
Ma'am?

227
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,942
<i>Mmmmm?</i>

228
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,859
What did you mean when
you said "that sort of girl?"

229
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,661
All in good time.

230
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,659
Ma'am?

231
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,785
Mmmmm?

232
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,155
I don't mind going out

233
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,922
and getting you herbs and
animals for your magic,

234
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,705
but I didn't know you were
going to hurt that priest.

235
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,050
We do what we have to do!

236
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,795
Yeah, but killing people?

237
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,049
There are some things
you just won't understand.

238
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,643
Leave it to hanagohl and me.

239
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,651
Leave what to you and me?

240
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,154
What's his problem?

241
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,686
He don't like you and me
killin' people.

242
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,659
Oh, that's too bad, innit?

243
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,987
You do as you're told,
you lazy turd.

244
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,664
Now hurry up, the both of 'ya.

245
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,462
<i>Reminds me of
myself in my youth.</i>

246
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,627
We're not going to hurt her,
are we?

247
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
You can't keep killing
people, it's just plain wrong.

248
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,933
I don't know what's
gettin' into you!

249
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:27,096
<i>If you won't do this
one little thing for me,</i>

250
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,851
well then, you can just
go on back a-home, mm-hmm?

251
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,646
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,282
What do you want me to do?

253
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,605
You get her attention.

254
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,321
Then I'll sneak up on her
with a cloth.

255
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,660
What do I do?

256
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,537
Think of something.

257
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,962
Hello?

258
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,375
Can I help you with that?

259
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:00,592
I'm fine.

260
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,564
Um, I seem to be a little lost.

261
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,273
Village is that way.

262
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,477
Thanks.

263
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,994
So, uh, do you live here
by yourself?

264
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,026
No, I share the place
with a bunch of dwarfs.

265
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,409
Can I help you with something?

266
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,617
I've been pretty much
walking for the past few days

267
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,000
and I was wondering, do you
have some food or something?

268
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,206
A beggar.

269
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,500
I shouldn't be taking people in.

270
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,461
Our parson's just been
found murdered!

271
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,762
I mean who knows what
kind of lunatic you'd be?

272
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,352
Take a seat.

273
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,767
This bread is very good, much
softer than we make at home.

274
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,823
Baked this afternoon.

275
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,327
You're staring at me.

276
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,537
You're very pretty, Miranda.

277
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,371
Maybe...

278
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,748
Peter, what is it?

279
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,473
Good work.

280
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,927
Help me get her into the barrow.

281
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,434
We may yet make a warlock
out of you, Peter!

282
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,348
And hanagohl will be so pleased!

283
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,739
You two took your
ol' sweet time.

284
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,574
It's almost midnight!

285
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,242
So.

286
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,000
So this is our sacrifice, is it?

287
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,336
Come on, don't stand
there, give us a hand!

288
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,010
Hasn't she got
the loveliest eyes?

289
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,234
I want 'em after!

290
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,185
I get the eyes!

291
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,475
You got 'em last time!

292
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,189
I never get anything good.

293
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,570
I get the eyes!

294
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:28,276
Well, I claim
all the teeth, then.

295
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,490
Ohhh!

296
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,949
Come on, it's gettin' late.

297
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:56,893
Ma'am?

298
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,649
What is it?

299
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,523
Can I be the one
to use the knife?

300
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,443
What?

301
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,607
Yes, do let him,
i think he's ready.

302
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,451
No, it's too important.

303
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,661
You do it.

304
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,036
He can kill the next sacrifice.

305
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,459
It's time.

306
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:30,303
Go ahead, make me proud.

307
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:40,807
Don't worry.

308
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,652
Stay calm and follow my lead.

309
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,738
<i>Go on, read it!</i>

310
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,197
You read it.

311
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,117
I can't read.

312
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,035
You know I can't read.

313
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:01,871
Umerigus, leviathan,
demons of the pit, hear us.

314
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,753
<i>Lord of the plague,
send us the soul</i>

315
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,224
<i>of our forsaken sister.</i>

316
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,850
<i>Nourish her with this dance.</i>

317
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,767
<i>And fill her full of hatred.</i>

318
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,913
Take this life in
thy darkest name.

319
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,246
A life for a life!

320
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,675
Now, you fool.
Now, kill her!

321
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,176
Peter!

322
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,277
Ungrateful witch!

323
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,820
I'm going to kill you!

324
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:05,242
I'm gonna cut you into
pieces when I'm through

325
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,742
with your little slut!

326
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,714
Witch!

327
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:09,914
Witch!

328
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,143
I'm gonna hurt you
like you hurt me!

329
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,521
You know, it woulda been
a lot easier

330
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:40,033
if you just ran away
when I suggested it.

331
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,493
Excuse me, sir, but you
could you please tell us

332
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,973
how to get outta here?

333
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,265
You killed my sisters.

334
00:30:57,481 --> 00:31:01,491
I'm gonna make this
very painful.

335
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,098
Ew, that's a mushy icky ending.

336
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,187
Well what kind of an
ending would you like?

337
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,318
Hmm, how 'bout a scary ending?

338
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,816
And you'll go to sleep?

339
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,278
Promise.

340
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,488
(0k3)!-

341
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,914
just then, magoga jumped
back to life, and...

342
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:18,905
Better?

343
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,122
Much.

344
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,747
Okay, good night, kid.

345
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,538
Good night,
night-night.

346
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,122
Uncle Mike!

347
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,054
Uncle Mike!

348
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,588
<i>Isn't she just adorable, folks?</i>

349
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,802
What now?

350
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,256
<i>Thank you, thank you!</i>

351
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,893
What is it?

352
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,850
A monster was gonna get me.

353
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,221
Oh Brian, for Christ's sakes,

354
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,774
the miss nude bayonne
competition

355
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,611
is on cablevision right now!

356
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,776
One more story, please?

357
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,494
Which story?

358
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,736
Hmm, little red riding hood.

359
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,369
Little red riding hood.

360
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,577
Hmm.

361
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:22,745
(0k3)!-

362
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:27,535
once upon a time, there was
a little girl called Rachel.

363
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,591
Actually, she wasn't
all that little.

364
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,924
She was a hot looking
high school senior,

365
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,840
with clear blue eyes
and fine firm breasts.

366
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,051
That's not the way
mommy tells it.

367
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,301
Shut up, that's the way
i tell it.

368
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:44,023
Anyhow, one day she came home
after cheerleading practice,

369
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,345
and she realized she wanted
to go jogging.

370
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,159
<i>Rachel, Rachel!</i>

371
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,501
<i>I need you to run an errand
for your grandmother.</i>

372
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,587
Okay, mom.

373
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,633
Uncle Mike, this story stinks.

374
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,263
Where's the big bad wolf?

375
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,510
Isn't there supposed to be
a big bad wolf?

376
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,972
Well yeah, I'm gettin' to that.

377
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,063
Meanwhile across town there
lived this guy named Willie.

378
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,559
<i>Was he a wolf?</i>

379
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,021
<i>Well, uh no.</i>

380
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:39,231
<i>Technically he wasn't,
not full time anyway.</i>

381
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,406
What's happening, my man?

382
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,289
Got a little present
for you from the islands.

383
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,211
Oh really, I love there.

384
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,419
Hmmmm.

385
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,380
Save that for my vacation.

386
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,220
Er1j'°y-

387
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,684
lunch hour, ha.

388
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,223
So how much do i
owe you this time?

389
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,309
Uh, $25 will do it.

390
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,475
I could only get seven
for you this time.

391
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,524
You know we had an arrangement.

392
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:18,477
I know, just uh, raise the
price when you resell 'em.

393
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,574
Yeah, sure.

394
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:26,073
I don't know who would take
this shit anyhow, frankly.

395
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,081
I took two a-these, knocked
me out for two days.

396
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:30,744
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

397
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,232
Yes ma'am,
what can I do for you.

398
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:33,807
Well I'm here to
pick up a prescription

399
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,245
for my grandmother?
Name's Krieger?

400
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,037
Uh huh, is this a house account?

401
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,501
Uh, yeah.

402
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,094
Oh, all outta the charge
slips, I'll be right back.

403
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,183
So, what's your name?

404
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:53,891
Rachel.

405
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,809
It's a pretty name.

406
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:56,727
Thank you.

407
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:57,976
Biblical, huh?

408
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,227
I wouldn't know.

409
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,442
Doing anything later?

410
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,067
None of your business.

411
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:06,738
Here you are, miss Krieger.

412
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,066
If you'll just sign here.

413
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,371
(0k3)!-

414
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,624
Rachel.

415
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:11,825
Rachel.

416
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,658
Oh, where?

417
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:14,619
Just anywhere
on the bottom is fine.

418
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,916
Here you go.

419
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,495
Thank you, bye bye.

420
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,710
Bye.

421
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,206
Always a pleasure.

422
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,967
Take this.

423
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,723
It'll help you forget.

424
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,848
Right

425
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,283
sorry.

426
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,565
Where were you?

427
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,742
Just running.

428
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,156
Where were you?

429
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,498
Waiting for you.

430
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Hi.

431
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,210
Hi.

432
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:13,929
Not here.

433
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,271
You're not gonna back
out on me again, are you?

434
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,523
You wanna go someplace else?

435
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:09,025
You gave me the goddamn
grandmother's medicine.

436
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,568
What are you talkin' about?

437
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,044
- Oh shit.
- Oh shit is right.

438
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,874
I need those pills.

439
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,750
Well maybe you should
ask granny for 'em.

440
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,177
Maybe you should ask
granny tomorrow morning,

441
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,038
she's gonna be sleepin'
pretty well tonight.

442
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,502
Just give me
her address then, quick.

443
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,463
Oh man, I can't do that.

444
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,890
Listen to me, you little shit.

445
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,433
If I'm not out cold
by moonrise tonight.

446
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,437
Get me her address.

447
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,483
Now.

448
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,287
Here we are.

449
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,252
This is it.

450
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,666
You're serious, aren't you?

451
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,631
What do 'ya think?

452
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,682
How very classy.

453
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:25,098
Well, lucky for you, I just
happen to have some candles.

454
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:26,977
Oh.

455
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,188
And, an air mattress.

456
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,188
How very spontaneous.

457
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:37,362
Um, did you happen to bring
an air pump by any chance?

458
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,658
Yes, can I help you?

459
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,445
Yeah hi, um, is Rachel here?

460
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,659
No.

461
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,125
She's not here.

462
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,512
What's your name?

463
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,720
Willie.

464
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,848
Willie, ah, if you
leave your number

465
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,058
I'll have her call you.

466
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,768
No, no, you can't do that
you see, it's kinda important.

467
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,000
Look can I just, can I just...

468
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,653
Oh absolutely not.

469
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,318
No, if you can't leave your
number you'll have to go.

470
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,527
Excuse me.

471
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,583
<i>Open the door.</i>

472
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:15,801
I will not, now you go
away or I'll call the police!

473
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,841
Lady, will you just
open the door?

474
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,635
Lady.

475
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,056
Lady!

476
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,056
Open the fucking door!

477
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,848
<i>C'mon, lady!</i>

478
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:34,902
I have a meat cleaver here
and I know how to use it!

479
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,314
Alright.

480
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,199
Wait.

481
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,197
- What?
- I gotta pee.

482
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,832
I'm back.

483
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,337
I missed you.

484
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,427
Hi.

485
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,470
Hi.

486
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,562
What's the matter now?

487
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,613
Making love, here.

488
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,611
Spiders.

489
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:50,702
Nah, it's too cold for spiders.

490
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,371
You scared?

491
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,058
Relax.

492
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:07,694
Fuck.

493
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:15,994
No.

494
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,661
I'm not ready.

495
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,521
I don't look any different.

496
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,399
What?

497
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,611
Nothing.

498
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:06,921
Did you hear that?

499
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:09,631
- Hear what?
- Shhh!

500
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,591
I don't hear anything.

501
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,627
<i>Sorry we did it?</i>

502
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:54,842
<i>No.</i>

503
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,344
<i>Good.</i>

504
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,097
Hey come on, it's gettin' late.

505
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,636
What time is it?

506
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,139
I don't know, must be about six.

507
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,231
Oh shit, my grandma's
gonna kill me.

508
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,922
Who's there?

509
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,631
Stop it!

510
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:00,925
Stop it!

511
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,552
Well, we're here.

512
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,131
You don't want me to
walk you to the door?

513
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,513
No, I'm in enough trouble.

514
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,601
Wait here, I'll be back.

515
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,022
Gram?

516
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,108
Gram?

517
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,799
What, help.

518
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,051
Gram!

519
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,070
Operator, oh please,
something terrible's happened.

520
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,321
Oh, send an ambulance, yes.

521
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,333
My address is 80 oakley road.

522
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,041
And please hurry!

523
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,141
<i>Dr. Martin, Dr. Martin.</i>

524
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,690
<i>Please dial 314.</i>

525
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,311
<i>Dr. Martin, Dr. Martin.</i>

526
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,902
<i>Please dial 3...</i>

527
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:02,067
Don't you think it's
time you headed home?

528
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,440
It's my fault.

529
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,572
How can you say that?

530
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,986
I wanna be here
when she wakes up.

531
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,832
Can I get you
some tea or something?

532
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,038
No.

533
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,466
Gram?

534
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,469
Rachel?

535
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,096
Oh, Rachel.

536
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,268
Gram, I was so worried.

537
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:39,604
It's okay.

538
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:42,565
It's okay.

539
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,193
How do you feel?

540
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,782
I ran to the door.

541
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,950
That bastard jumped me
from behind.

542
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,374
I'm so sorry, I should've...

543
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:04,634
Gram?

544
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,338
Are you alright?

545
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:09,842
Grandma!

546
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:10,968
What big teeth you have!

547
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,727
Red riding hood is grabbed

548
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,604
in a frenzy
of snarls and growls.

549
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,811
Ripped apart and unfortunately,

550
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,902
no one lived happily ever after.

551
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,817
The end, good...
Night.

552
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:51,842
Uncle Mike?

553
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,567
Uncle Mike!

554
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:20,535
Ahhh, monster!

555
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,841
Monster!

556
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,844
There is no monster in here.

557
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,126
There's no monster in here.

558
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:31,257
Nothing here, nothing here.

559
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,176
Definite deficit of monsters
in here, isn't there?

560
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,426
No monster in here.

561
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,638
Nothing in here.

562
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,521
Okay, so you see there's no
monster in this room, right?

563
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:42,847
Just one more story, please?

564
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,601
Goldilocks and the
three bears, please?

565
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:45,523
Nooo!

566
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:46,731
Just one, please!

567
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,483
- No no no no no more.
- Please! Just one!

568
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:50,863
It's time to go to bed.

569
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:55,109
- And I'll go to bed, please!
- Brian, no no no, Brian!

570
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:02,326
Once upon a time, on a
bright, sunny spring day.

571
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:06,998
While the birds were singing
and the bees were bee-ing.

572
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:13,003
There lived papa baer, and
mama baer, and baby baer.

573
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,968
And a little girl named
goldi lox.

574
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,069
Alright, alright,

575
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,855
just what do you two
think you're doin'?

576
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,069
We're goin' home.

577
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,568
Sure you are, maybe
you'd like some money

578
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:36,781
to take along with you?

579
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:37,907
Sure, that'd be real...

580
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,243
Let me handle this!

581
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,701
Now we don't want any
problems from you, pal.

582
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,412
We'll be outta here
in a few minutes.

583
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,542
Okay, okay, why don't
you just give me that gun

584
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:48,709
before you get yourselves
in trouble?

585
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,383
Now don't try anything funny.

586
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,010
Look dad, it's mama!

587
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,758
Oh no, I'm not fallin'
for that old one.

588
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,363
Oh, I am sorry i am late!

589
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,702
But you wouldn't believe
the day I had,

590
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:20,698
one thing after another.

591
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,429
First, this morning,
i get a phone call.

592
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,662
Mr. Henri got his head stuck
in the revolving doors.

593
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:25,871
So I get to my 3:30...

594
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:28,924
Hairdressers, then, I'm sitting
down, watching, donahue...

595
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,266
Why don't you tell us
on the way?

596
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,293
Oh yes.

597
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,433
Hang on, boys.

598
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:40,386
Heads up.

599
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,389
See.

600
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,737

I have to go.

614
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:30,961
Oh baby, you shoulda
thought a-that

615
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,269
before we left the asylum.

616
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,860
Happens every time
we go anywhere.

617
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,397
Can we stop for ice cream?

618
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,611
No!

619
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,454
Just where are we goin' anyway?

620
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,696
Remember that nice little
house we used to live in?

621
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,869
I think it's vacant now.

622
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:49,907
Oh yeah, the one in amityville.

it's not that I'm not flattered.

631
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,978
It's just that I'm, well,

632
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,444
not ready to make
that kind of commitment.

633
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:17,436
I'm sorry things didn't
work out between us.

634
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:18,901
You are kind of cute.

635
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,158
Oh will you be quiet?

636
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,275
Well, I guess we better

638
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:44,144
I really should be angry at you.

639
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:46,854
You boys are all the same.

640
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:49,885
Just want one thing
and one thing only.

641
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,560
Just like all the rest.

642
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,059
Afternoon, boys!

643
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,937
<i>Why don't you give us a kiss?</i>

644
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:04,693
<i>What kind of girl
do you think I am?</i>

645
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,124
<i>That kind.</i>

646
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,695
Let's see, Norman, this is Fred.

647
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,712
Fred, Norman, you two should
get along well together.

648
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,075
You have a lot in common.

649
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:18,093

693
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:30,764
Porridge?

694
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,099
Why must we always
have porridge?

695
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,314
Don't you know how to make
anything but porridge?

696
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:36,965
Tradition.

697
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,004
<i>Well, let's start
a new tradition.</i>

698
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:43,270
Steak, pork, yak,
anything but porridge.

699
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,671
You know we can't afford steak.

700
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:45,861
Not on your salary.

701
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,147
Which, at the moment,
is nothing.

702
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,531
Right, we need money.

703
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,818
How 'bout welfare?

704
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:54,783
What?

705
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,293
Welfare, that's ridiculous.

706
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,635
Our family will get our money

707
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,253

708
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,457

01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,206
<i>Gentlemen, thank you
for taking time</i>

721
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,270
<i>out of your busy schedules
to be with us today.</i>

722
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:06,228
<i>Sure, anything
to get on television.</i>

723
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:09,529
Captain quick, what do you
think the recent murder sprees

724
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:12,114
say about today's society?

725
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,110
Hmph, I don't know.

726
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:17,992
Well it's um, uh, it's
because of, uh, today's

727
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:22,251
permissive sex and, uh,
and recreational violence.

728
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:26,875
It's like a huge,
festering pus wad

729
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:29,585
<i>and it just keeps
getting larger and bigger</i>

730
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,046
<i>and grows larger and
larger until it explodes</i>

731
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:36,297
covering us all with a
sticky, slimy, smelly mess.

732
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,595
It's like when you
lay down with dogs,

733
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,556
you get up with puppies.

734
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,516
Well let's follow that up,
lt. Nimble.

735
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,806
In cases such as these,
what are the chances

736
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,860
for a successful rehabilitation?

737
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:48,694
Well, l..

738
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,518
<i>You gotta catch 'em first.</i>

739
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,903
- What?
- You have to catch 'em first.

740
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:54,111
What do you mean by that?

741
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,155
Nothing, remember I've
seen you in action, heh.

742
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:58,735
Are you saying I'm a bad cop?

743
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:00,330
Yeah, I'm callin' you a bad cop.

744
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:01,155
Oh yeah?

745
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:02,159
Hey fellas, we are on the air!

746
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,370
Why I oughta...

747
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,639
Someone's in there, all right.

748
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:27,349
<i>J1 my, mmmmmm, my Eden</i>

749
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,727
maybe we could throw in
a few of these

750
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:31,819
just to soften up the area.

751
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,900
At the community college,
silly, I took, uh, pyrotechnics,

752
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,612
hand-to-hand combat,
and what else?

753
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,033
Oh yes, macrame.

754
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,738
Nah, too messy.

755
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,117
Let's go in with the old
avon lady bit.

756
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,037
Just cover us with the uzi.

757
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:51,421
<i>41 oh, ummm</i>

758
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,181

01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,789
someone's sleepin' in my bed!

762
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,292
Someone's sleepin' in my bed.

763
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,501
Somebody's sleepin' in my, yuck!

764
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,592
<i>J1 I like walking in the rain</i>

<i>j1 ree Lee up boo ippity</i>

769
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,653
you were expecting perhaps
Janet Lee?

770
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,860
All right, get out!

771
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,327
Look what I found.

772
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:10,499
I'm sorry, I didn't
think anyone lived here.

773
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:11,707
Aren't you cute.

774
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:12,706
What's your name, honey.

775
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,087
Goldi, goldi lox.

776
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:18,094
Actually, it's golda, I was
born during the six day war.

777
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,717
Isn't she darling.

778
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:20,924
Shall I waste her, dear?

779
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:22,048
No, don't, I'm...

780
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,340
I wouldn't be much bother.

781
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,723
I can cook and do
all sorts of things.

782
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,720
Well, I don't know.

783
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,732
<i>What do you “fink, mama'?</i>

784
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,524
I think she'll fit in
just fine around here.

785
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,519
She'll be like the daughter
we never had.

786
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:37,401
And you'll be like the
parents I brutally slaughtered.

787
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:41,485
She's been spotted
here, here, and here.

788
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,280
Now our reconnaissance
says she has to be here

789
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,701
in this deserted house.

790
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,040
So, here's the plan of action.

791
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,665
<i>In one hour we'll form on a
highway just outside the house.</i>

792
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:57,669
Once we group, we go in,
in plainclothes cars.

793
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:01,379
We'll line up out front and
wait for her to come out.

794
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,301
<i>And bring plenty
of firepower, boys.</i>

795
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,839
This little girl's our dynamo.

796
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,595
<i>D you musta been
a beautiful baby</i>

797
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:17,822
<i>i1 musta been a beautiful child</i>

798
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,234
huh?

799
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,844
Oh, hello baby.

800
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,630
You startled me.

801
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,508
Gee, I'm sorry.

802
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:45,337
Papa asked me to
bury these guys.

803
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:52,433
So tell me, why do they
call you baby, anyway?

804
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:53,812
I don't know.

805
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,400
I guess I got it
when I was younger.

806
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:58,605
Oh.

807
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,187
I like you, baby.

808
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,030
You're so... different.

809
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,544
I'm just a regular guy.

810
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,124
No, don't ever say that!

811
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:18,000
You've got to be different
from the rest.

812
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,789
I like you, too, goldi!

813
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,002
Kiss me!

814
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,562
Wow, what a woman!

815
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,107
I love 'ya!

816
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:44,897
Baby!

817
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,361
Baby!

818
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:47,281
Baby!

819
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,278
Oh I love you.

820
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,489
Baby.

821
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:50,834
Baby.

822
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,163
Baby!

823
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,750
No, too rough, no.

824
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,374
'Baby!
"No!

825
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:57,211
- No, no.
- Baby.

826
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,035
Baby!

827
01:12:58,249 --> 01:12:59,669
"No!

828
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,086
Baby!

829
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,678
If only I'd known.

830
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,647
Sorry, boys.

831
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:32,951
She loves me.

832
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,359
We know the baers are holed up

833
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:35,905
in that house across the field.

834
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,830
Now considering the
shrewd criminal mind

835
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,249
we're dealing with...

836
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:40,997
She loves me not.

837
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,788
We decided to enter
through the rear.

838
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,172
That's my idea.

839
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,054
She loves me.

840
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,216
You spell the name, n-i-m...

841
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,425
She loves me not.

842
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:51,635
B-l-e.

843
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,101
Now, in case there's shooting.

844
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:55,184
Remember, drop low
and to my right.

845
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:56,723
<i>That's my best side.</i>

846
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,346
She loves me!

847
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:04,358
<i>We thank thee, lord,</i>

848
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,185
<i>for what we are
about to receive.</i>

849
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:10,203
<i>Porridge again?</i>

850
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,974
With all that commotion
i didn't have the time

851
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,949
to go to the store today.

852
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:19,121
And on top of all that,
it's too hot!

853
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:20,540
What do we do?

854
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:24,332
Well, why don't we go
for a walk until it cools?

855
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,967
Nah, screw it, let's go
get a pizza.

856
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:36,889
Papa, I have to go.

857
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:38,723
No!

858
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,138
No way. I told you,
i don't like hairy fish.

859
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:15,683
All right, no anchovies.

860
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:17,046
Do you want anything else?

861
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,013
Can I have a drink, papa?

862
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:20,683
Sure, why not?

863
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,267
I'll have a double
bourbon and whiskey, please.

864
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,191
I'll have a yoo-hoo.

865
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:27,397
No, no you won't.

866
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,606
Choco pop, okay?

867
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,824
What about you, little Princess?

868
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,528
Coke.

869
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:36,321
She's one...

870
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,865
Alright men, that's far enough.

871
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:50,133
From these positions we
have optimum viewing capacity.

872
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,797
I don't want anyone to advance...

873
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:54,296
Further, until you
hear my signal.

874
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,508
The thing to do here...

875
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,386
Is to remain calm...

876
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,885
Alert, and relaxed.

877
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:00,717
- The key...
- Ls not...

878
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:01,561
<i>_tq__</i>
- over...

879
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:02,476
React!

880
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,773
I'm gettin' too old
for this type of life.

881
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,398
I didn't want you to be
part of it.

882
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,020
I had other plans for you.

883
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:11,778
Senator baer.

884
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,688
Governor baer.

885
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,281
President baer.

886
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:18,907
Not this.

887
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,189
If only we could
just settle down

888
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,037
quietly somewheres.

889
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,215
Ah, not now, we're probably
on every police blotter

890
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,787
in the country.

891
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,749
Where will we go, what'll we do?

892
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:31,383
California, we'd
probably blend in there.

893
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,087
Nobody would notice us there.

894
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,717
Yeah!

895
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:37,134
And you can become one of
them television preachers.

896
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,498
Fire!

897
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,296
Cease fire, cease fire!

898
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:25,520
And so the scene here
is total carnage.

899
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:29,644
To repeat, the infamous
baer gang has been wiped out

900
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:32,444
<i>by a fierce firefight
that utilized</i>

901
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,568
<i>the combined efforts
of local authorities</i>

902
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,565
<i>and the state police.</i>

903
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:41,107
<i>In addition, the report
is that little goldi lox,</i>

904
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,453
<i>who is known to have
killed a dozen plus people,</i>

905
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:48,080
<i>was also consumed in the fray.</i>

906
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,003
<i>There are a great many bodies...</i>

907
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:54,668
Okay that was two
specials and two cokes.

908
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:58,005
Okay that'll be...

909
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,886
I can't breathe.

910
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,479
My treat.

911
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:44,012
And they all lived
happily ever after.

912
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,259
<i>Oops.</i>

913
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:50,813
<i>Though not everyone
they came across was so lucky.</i>

914
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,604
Okay, no more stories?

915
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,313
No more stories.

916
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:58,943
Okay. Good night.

917
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,151
