1
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,708
<i>No one has meant more
to me in my life</i>

2
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,585
<i>than my dear Molotov.</i>

3
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,097
I see. Yes, go outside.

4
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,684
Go ahead and jump out.
It gets cold in here if you dawdle.

5
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,648
There's food in an hour.
Just meow so I can hear you.

6
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,739
Molotov! Come to daddy!

7
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,575
Come on now, have a bite to eat.

8
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,245
Molotov!

9
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,001
No, no...

10
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,923
No, no, no...

11
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:13,759
No, no, no!

12
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,556
No, no...

13
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,683
Bastard!

14
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,814
Damn it...

15
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,986
Goddamned fox.

16
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,238
You'll soon get your last meal.

17
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,910
I'll show you one hell of a dessert.

18
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,389
<i>And then I lost him.</i>

19
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:05,227
<i>And suddenly I had blasted
my way into a retirement home.</i>

20
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,938
Sixty one...

21
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,609
- How is it going?
- Sixty two...

22
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,822
I just lost count.
How many are there in each pack?

23
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,451
Ten candles per pack,
like it says on them.

24
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,246
- You can't be certain.
- It's usually correct.

25
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,209
You can't be certain. I'll count again.

26
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,130
I'll have to start over.
One, two, three, four...

27
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:27,244
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

28
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,915
Allan! Allan?

29
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,259
- Good lord, where is he?
- Where's the old man?

30
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,678
Where did he go?

31
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,121
Hello, I...

32
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,336
Is there... Can you travel
somewhere from here?

33
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:22,049
- Where did you say you were going?
- I didn't say.

34
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,886
I asked if there were any
conveyances here. Out of here.

35
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:31,850
- When?
- When? Well... whenever.

36
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:36,688
When is the next...?
Is anything leaving?

37
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:41,318
The bus for Strängnäs
leaves in three minutes.

38
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,279
- Strängnäs?
- Number 322.

39
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,490
- Is that suitable?
- Yes...

40
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,870
Is this enough?

41
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:57,835
No. This will take you to Byringe.

42
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,047
- So... what is there in Byringe?
- Not a damn thing.

43
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:06,427
I see. A one-way ticket
to Byringe, then. Thanks.

44
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,764
And you are...

45
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,684
over sixty-five?

46
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,769
Right.

47
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,688
Let's see...

48
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,405
- There you go.
- Thank you.

49
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,872
Damn!

50
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,916
Come on! What the hell?

51
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,795
What the fuck were they thinking?

52
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,758
- Hold on to this bag and don't let go!
- But I...

53
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,094
Shut the fuck up! Damn...

54
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,273
He must have gone up in smoke.
He's nowhere to be found.

55
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,985
It's pitch black down here
and everything is locked.

56
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,821
There's no way
he could have gotten in here.

57
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:12,034
We have to call the police.
Will you do it?

58
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,911
It's best if you do.

59
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,623
Allan? Allan?

60
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,208
Allan!

61
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,419
<i>One or two people have screamed
at me through the years,</i>

62
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,339
<i>from bus conductors to dictators.</i>

63
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,675
Where the fuck are you, old man?

64
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,141
Allan...

65
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,854
<i>The very first person
to scream at me was my mother.</i>

66
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:44,358
<i>I don't remember it, but I'm sure she did.</i>

67
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,152
<i>I'm sure I screamed too.</i>

68
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,906
<i>I guess that is what babies do
when they arrive in the world.</i>

69
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,660
<i>I didn't get much time
to hear my father scream.</i>

70
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:59,248
- You have blasphemed!
- Do you mean showing the rubber?

71
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:03,544
It's the only solution to famine
and poverty. Is that blasphemy?

72
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:09,049
If you're doing it on Children's Day
in the middle of town...

73
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,970
you can bet your ass
it's blasphemy! There, go!

74
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,223
<i>The last time I saw him, I was only nine.</i>

75
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,184
I can't live in this hypocritical monarchy!

76
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,478
In Russia things get done!

77
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,063
Shut your mouth!

78
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,731
<i>He had gone to Moscow</i>

79
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:28,527
<i>to declare himself leader
of a new independent republic.</i>

80
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,321
<i>Fifteen square meters
where he could be himself.</i>

81
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:35,659
This is the solution
to famine and poverty.

82
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,662
With this,
the woman doesn't become pregnant.

83
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,791
No kids! This is amazing...

84
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,501
What are you doing?
This is my republic!

85
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:48,630
<i>Until the Russians came,
and took care of him.</i>

86
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,260
The solution to famine and poverty!

87
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,178
Can I say one last thing?

88
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,603
Constable, constable, constable!

89
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:11,278
<i>We were told of Father's death
on a sunny April day.</i>

90
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,281
<i>I remember that,
because that's the day.</i>

91
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,367
<i>I discovered how good it felt
to blow things up.</i>

92
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,458
<i>Everything Father had left behind
arrived in a little box.</i>

93
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:29,212
<i>"Mother got a colorful egg,
made by some "Fabbe” guy</i>

94
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:34,426
<i>and I got an old Russian lady doll,
matryoshka.</i>

95
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,386
<i>Yes, and a camera.</i>

96
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,265
<i>Yeah, good presents.</i>

97
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:50,609
<i>Mother traded the egg for some food
from Gustavsson the merchant.</i>

98
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:55,322
<i>Well, it turned out
to be a good deal... for him.</i>

99
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,325
<i>I guess that's what merchants do.</i>

100
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:04,289
<i>After Father's death,
Mother coughed for two more years</i>

101
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,000
<i>before joining him
where he might have gone,</i>

102
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,835
<i>that heaven they talk about.</i>

103
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,924
<i>That's when I started
worrying about the future.</i>

104
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,678
<i>Yeah. I guess that's what kids do
when they become orphans.</i>

105
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:21,056
- How am I going to manage?
- You sound like your father, Allan.

106
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,476
He was always thinking
for no good reason.

107
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,520
And see how he ended up.

108
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,939
Thinking will get you nowhere.

109
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,234
The only sure thing
is that it is what it is.

110
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,612
And that it will be what it will be.

111
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,783
<i>Yeah, those were Mother's last words.</i>

112
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,164
<i>And since then, I've been on my own.</i>

113
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,516
- Hey! Hey.
- What?

114
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,770
- You forgot your bag.
- Right, that thing.

115
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,176
No trains run here. It's closed down.

116
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,345
What was that?

117
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,432
No trains run here.

118
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,726
The station is closed.

119
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:52,189
Yeah, I can see that.
I wasn't born yesterday.

120
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,067
So what are you doing here?

121
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,362
The bus stopped here.

122
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,992
But where the hell are you going?

123
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,370
Going...? Well, that's...

124
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,249
I don't know. We'll see.

125
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:15,045
- Have you been on the road long?
- On the road?

126
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:19,508
That's some serious luggage there.

127
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:23,178
No, this isn't mine.

128
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,891
- It just kind of came with me.
- So, an old rogue.

129
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:35,649
- Are you hungry?
- Well, food... Mostly thirsty.

130
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:40,529
- I think we can fix that.
- Really? That's nice.

131
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,697
- Do you know where we're going?
- I usually jog around here...

132
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,325
- I could not care less.
- I mean I know this area really well.

133
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,661
What fucking area?
Do you know where we're going?

134
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,957
- Yes, I know the area.
- Damned lucky for you.

135
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,250
What the hell...?

136
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:01,132
- What's going on? What's the problem?
- Out of gas.

137
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,551
Damn!

138
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,182
Do you have a gas can in here?

139
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,936
- Well?
- There's only one house in Byringe.

140
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,605
- It's brown, or light brown.
- What the hell.

141
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,404
And it's a little yellow...
or light beige.

142
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,729
Where the hell are you going?

143
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,986
You don't think he's just gotten lost?

144
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,364
No, I don't. His mind is all there.

145
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,367
There is nothing wrong with his mind.

146
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,996
Can you imagine?
Running away from his own party!

147
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:36,042
And I've spent so much time and effort
on him, and he just disappears.

148
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:41,715
We bought a huge marzipan cake,
good for 40 people at the very least.

149
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,260
We ordered it for him,
because he likes marzipan cake.

150
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:50,557
We usually get cream cakes.
Marzipan gets stuck in old folks' teeth.

151
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,309
What do I do with that cake now?

152
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,479
The old folks here can't eat marzipan.

153
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:01,026
I could consider a Black Forest cake,
but it's not my birthday.

154
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:06,781
You give me a call when he returns.
Cases like these resolve very quickly.

155
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,118
You don't think he went out the window?

156
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,662
It was open when we came in
singing this morning.

157
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,165
- Yes, yes.
- It was actually open.

158
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:19,961
I don't know. It's entirely possible.

159
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:24,883
- Call me when he comes. It'll be fine.
- I don't think so.

160
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,304
I hate retirement homes.

161
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,349
They think they'll get
me into one this fall.

162
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,728
I've only set foot in one once.

163
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,815
If you've had four drinks,
you might as well have another.

164
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:48,949
I got some money to entertain
the old folks with my accordion.

165
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,618
They sat there, mouths agape.

166
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,371
- So you're an accordionist?
- Sure do.

167
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,168
Poor saps, sitting there.
I'd rather be in jail.

168
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,758
- Congratulations again.
- Right, I'd forgotten.

169
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,552
Down the hatch.

170
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,309
Did you have an old lady?

171
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,731
No, it never turned out that way.

172
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:25,235
How the hell did you avoid that?

173
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,656
- Do you pee outside?
- Yeah.

174
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,952
I have to make room for the next round.

175
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:43,586
I'm glad you enjoyed the food.
There's dessert too.

176
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,672
Yes, I'll be there.

177
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,347
Hello, is anyone there? Hello?

178
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,475
- Where is the geezer and the suitcase?
- We're closed.

179
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,358
Where's the geezer
and my goddamned suitcase?

180
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,402
I live alone here...

181
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,739
You think I'm an idiot? Who sat here?

182
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,700
No, please. Ow!

183
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,452
- Hold on, damn it!
- Where's the geezer?

184
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,913
You are fucking lying.

185
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:24,586
- Ow! Stop!
- I'll kill you, do you understand?

186
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,633
- Do you understand?
- Yes! Stop.

187
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:38,058
Let's toss a goddamned coin
to see if you get to live or not!

188
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:42,103
Please stop. If you just settle down...

189
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,898
Fucking lucky I don't have any coins!

190
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,234
There's a change bowl in the hall.

191
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,030
In what hall?
Are you fucking nuts? I'm not...

192
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,745
- Christ, what a smash.
- You don't say?

193
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,916
Hey, that dessert you mentioned?
How about that?

194
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,919
- We have to get rid of him.
- What?

195
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:09,005
- Before he wakes up.
- Okay.

196
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:15,345
I have to admit
that I'm getting curious

197
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:19,390
about what's in the suitcase.

198
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,814
There! Let's see.
This is the quickest way...

199
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,191
- Oh, a little much.
- To open it.

200
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:32,570
- I'll take that one.
- Even if you know the combination.

201
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,864
Should we drink it straight, or...?

202
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:43,081
Oh, my sweet lord!

203
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:48,294
That was quite a bit of cash.
No wonder the little boy was whining.

204
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:54,008
Open up, damn it! Hey, geezer!

205
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:58,805
Come on and let me out of here!
I just want that damned suitcase.

206
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,057
- Calm down.
- I won't hurt you.

207
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,273
Seriously! Hey!

208
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,402
- What was that?
- I turned the freezer unit on.

209
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:17,157
Here's what we'll do:
I'll take the suitcase and leave.

210
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,783
I won't hurt you!

211
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,037
<i>Making grand plans is easy
when you're locked up.</i>

212
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,123
<i>Or in a jam.</i>

213
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,250
<i>But it does no good.</i>

214
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:32,255
<i>Because life is what it is,
and it does what it does,</i>

215
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,966
<i>as Gustavsson the merchant found out.</i>

216
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,762
Wait here, baby.

217
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,474
Hurry back!

218
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,519
<i>He'd sneaked away
on a well-planned day-trip.</i>

219
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:49,689
<i>He picked a sunny day,
a beautiful road</i>

220
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,400
<i>and just the right hill
for his pee break.</i>

221
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,111
<i>And still, it all went to hell.</i>

222
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,532
<i>I had chosen the same hill
for my explosives test.</i>

223
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,376
<i>She screamed to high heaven.</i>

224
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,129
<i>I guess that's
what mistresses do</i>

225
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,257
<i>when merchant heads land on car hoods.</i>

226
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,346
<i>Even if the test was a success,</i>

227
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,682
<i>it did land me in the mental hospital.</i>

228
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,523
There.

229
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,904
This is your room now.
No shenanigans here.

230
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,681
<i>After a few years behind bars,</i>

231
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:08,434
<i>I ended up with
what they call a racial biologist.</i>

232
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,312
<i>His name was Professor Lundborg.</i>

233
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:12,522
Stop it, Allan.

234
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,557
Do you know if you have
any negro blood in the family?

235
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:51,394
No, I don't think so.

236
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,229
It just doesn't add up.

237
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:58,651
You have negroid measurements
and are prone to violence...

238
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,238
yet quite light-skinned.

239
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:06,743
If you have a negro somewhere,
it would be interesting to meet one.

240
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,459
- Allan's father was a revolutionary.
- Yes, he was a little special.

241
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,420
And the apple doesn't seem
to fall far from the tree.

242
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,424
I think we should err
on the side of caution.

243
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,844
<i>The professor set up the equipment,</i>

244
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:29,307
<i>making sure my genes
wouldn't spread into society.</i>

245
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,602
- The patient is ready, Doctor.
- Right.

246
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:36,439
<i>Well, I guess that's
what racial biologists do.</i>

247
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,656
Patch him up a little extra.

248
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,535
<i>His hands weren't exactly steady,</i>

249
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,081
<i>but I understand the operation went well.</i>

250
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,212
Forty nine million,
eight hundred thousand...

251
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,297
The last ones.

252
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,385
49 million, nine hundred thousand.

253
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,428
And that one.

254
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,015
Fifty million!

255
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,935
You know how to count. Not bad.

256
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,895
That wasn't so bad.

257
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,403
Still not reaching him?

258
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:25,863
I don't know
what the hell happened to his phone.

259
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:28,699
Fucking phone isn't working.

260
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,160
- Keep calling.
- Should I leave a voice mail?

261
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,871
Text him.
Go with your first idea for once.

262
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:34,717
What was he doing?

263
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:36,774
He was just supposed
to pick up something.

264
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,918
- Pick up something?
- A suitcase.

265
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,839
- A suitcase?
- Yes. You know what a suitcase is.

266
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,467
It's a portable space
to keep your stuff in.

267
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:50,930
- Couldn't you get the suitcase?
- Does this look like jewelry to you?

268
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:54,684
- Sorry, I forgot the ankle monitor.
- I haven't forgotten about it!

269
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,438
- Is that Bulten?
- I'll take this.

270
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,733
- Shut up. I'll do the talking.
- Is that Bulten?

271
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,611
I said shut up. This is Gäddan.

272
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,571
Caracas, bitch! Telephone!

273
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,907
Come here!

274
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:55,328
Who is it?

275
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:09,342
- We have it.
- What do you mean?

276
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,761
One of my guys has the money,
so we have the money.

277
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,971
Say we have it, dammit,
it's not a problem.

278
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:36,327
I ask you to do one thing:
Say we have the money.

279
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,705
Is that so fucking hard?
This is unbelievable.

280
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:44,961
You go to Malmköping and pick
that moron up! This is serious!

281
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,557
- Java?
- Yes, please.

282
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,225
Aspirin.

283
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,895
Did you sleep well?

284
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,480
Yeah.

285
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:07,233
He hasn't made
any noise this morning?

286
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,319
No, not a sound.

287
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,830
Twenty degrees below freezing?
Damn it!

288
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,298
God damn it! What have I done?

289
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,717
Bloody hell!

290
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,512
- How could I leave the cold on?
- Oh, my.

291
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,015
Yeah, well...

292
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,643
It'll work out.

293
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:46,188
<i>Regret doesn't do you much good,</i>

294
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,733
<i>not unless you own a time machine.</i>

295
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:53,195
<i>You know, regret doesn't undo
the thing you regret doing.</i>

296
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:58,868
<i>And my operation,
well, I never regretted that.</i>

297
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,622
<i>On the contrary,
it was a real stroke of luck.</i>

298
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,667
<i>If my crotch hadn't been so stiff</i>

299
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,753
<i>from the professor's shaky hand,</i>

300
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,922
<i>I would never have stopped
by the cannon foundry.</i>

301
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,426
<i>Nor would I have taken
a job there either.</i>

302
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:19,639
- Where are the cannons?
- We cast the barrels here.

303
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,641
You'll observe for a week.

304
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,644
Esteban! Shut up and work!

305
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,105
We have to work together
for a better world.

306
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:34,987
<i>Esteban, the Spaniard,
was as slim as a ﬂagpole.</i>

307
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:39,367
<i>But, then again, he only used his mouth
for talking, nothing else.</i>

308
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,826
Come with me and fight Franco!

309
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,205
Allan! Where are you in this?

310
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,457
What do you want?
You need to make a stand!

311
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,836
- Explain that to me.
- I like to shoot. I like the booming.

312
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,672
We have to do something.

313
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,757
<i>When Spain was headed for civil war,</i>

314
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,093
<i>he invited me to go with him</i>

315
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,429
<i>to help him crush
somebody called Franco.</i>

316
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,599
<i>I figured, why not?</i>

317
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:07,186
<i>After all, in war you must get
to blow things up.</i>

318
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:10,606
Long live the revolution!
Long live Durutti!

319
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,360
Where are you going?
Come join the international brigades!

320
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,241
Hitler is a good man!

321
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,285
I need to sleep.

322
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,415
Comrades, don't sleep!

323
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:33,212
We have to fight against Franco!
We'd rather die than give up!

324
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,506
Long live the revolution!

325
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,976
Comrades, raise the ﬂag of the republic!

326
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,187
And open your revolutionary hearts.

327
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,900
<i>When we got there, the first bullet
of the war had not yet been fired.</i>

328
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:57,319
Death to the fascists!
Death to Franco!

329
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,865
<i>That is,
until Esteban stood up to shout.</i>

330
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:05,286
<i>My mother's words
of wisdom came back to me.</i>

331
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,080
<i>“You shouldn't talk too much”.</i>

332
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:14,545
<i>And he never got to blow up
any bridges, poor guy.</i>

333
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:19,258
<i>But me, I got to blow up quite a few.</i>

334
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,265
<i>Tres, dos</i> and <i>uno.</i>

335
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,017
Here comes the bang!

336
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,230
Get down! Damn!

337
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,110
<i>For many years,
I did nothing but eat and sleep</i>

338
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,237
<i>and blow things up.</i>

339
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,742
<i>It was a wonderful time.</i>

340
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,469
<i>But it was a little bit too much
of a good thing.</i>

341
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:10,226
<i>Suddenly, the urge
to blows things up was gone.</i>

342
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,480
<i>So I figured... screw this.</i>

343
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,148
<i>I'll do something else.</i>

344
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:21,195
<i>Having walked through Spain
for hundreds of miles,</i>

345
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,031
<i>I certainly didn't mind getting a ride.</i>

346
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,533
Stop!

347
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,579
What's he doing there? Stop the car!

348
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,122
Stop, stop!

349
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,465
<i>As it turned out, it was General Franco
cruising the countryside.</i>

350
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,844
<i>He appreciated my waving,</i>

351
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:49,932
<i>and treated me to dancing
and paella and lots of rioja.</i>

352
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:55,938
<i>That was a perfect ending
to my stay in Spain.</i>

353
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,860
My friend Allan.
You have saved my life.

354
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,363
I will give you a gift.
My favorite pistol.

355
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,740
What a shiny knickknack.

356
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,118
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

357
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:15,791
Hey, mister.
Do you think it can be fired?

358
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,502
This is how you dance!

359
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:31,473
Relax, everyone.
That's my friend Allan.

360
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,727
Tell me, Allan.

361
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,813
What will you miss most
about our beautiful country?

362
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:42,651
The wine, and my friend Esteban.

363
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,820
He died.

364
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,823
Long live Esteban!

365
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:55,039
What's beeping? Hear that?

366
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,582
A telephone.

367
00:31:56,665 --> 00:32:00,002
- What?
- Yeah, here.

368
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,965
Lots of text messages coming in.

369
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:07,968
- Now?
- The reception is bad in there.

370
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:13,891
“From Gäddan.
From Hinken... Hinken... Hinken...”

371
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:17,269
- Hinken?
- “...Hinken, Mom...”

372
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:20,272
- “...Hinken, Gäddan...”
- He's popular.

373
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:24,026
Well, maybe not.
Hinken writes, “Call or die”.

374
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,875
Great timing...

375
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,712
- Hello?
- Hi, Gäddan.

376
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,965
- I'm at the station now.
- <i>Yes?</i>

377
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,384
- The place is totally empty.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

378
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,720
There's just some moron
in the ticket window.

379
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,640
- What do I do?
- Did you ask him?

380
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:58,477
- <i>What do I ask?</i>
- If he's seen anything.

381
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,397
Yeah, okay. I'll ask.

382
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:20,249
Ronny Hult is here, with his wife.

383
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,710
Pick up your own visitors next time.

384
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:26,255
Yeah, sorry. I didn't even know
they'd shown up.

385
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,968
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

386
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,263
So, tell me what happened yesterday.

387
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,433
Well, I work at the travel center.

388
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,602
A few hours had passed.
It was around lunch time...

389
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:44,064
Just tell him what happened!

390
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:47,943
- Well... that's what I'm doing.
- You're not doing it very well.

391
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:55,159
Okay. This guy jumped me.
He was quite violent.

392
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:59,496
You forgot to mention the old guy.
Do it in the right order.

393
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:05,252
First, there was this old person,
a man I sold a ticket to.

394
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:09,965
That was the hundred-year-old.
He buys a ticket from Ronny.

395
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,342
Then this biker guy shows up,

396
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:16,388
assaults Ronny
and makes him drive to Byringe.

397
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,541
Hello?

398
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,089
Anyone home?

399
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,344
Do you know what time it is?

400
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:01,350
Yeah, it's almost eleven o'clock.

401
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:05,854
Good. That means it's almost time
for their lunch break.

402
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,362
Hey there.

403
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:18,450
- Hi.
- Bye.

404
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,254
I see...

405
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:40,139
I see... That could have been painful.

406
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:43,559
Being dead can have
its advantages sometimes.

407
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,565
- There.
- Oh.

408
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,289
- Do we throw it all out?
- All of it.

409
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:11,003
- Now what? I see...
- He goes in there.

410
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:18,385
There.

411
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,392
Djibouti?

412
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:29,146
Well, he gets
to see the world anyway.

413
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:35,194
The good thing about vests
is that sizes aren't that big a deal.

414
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,463
You throw like a girl.

415
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,925
- What?
- Julius,

416
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:01,678
you'll have to help me pull the suitcase.
Now that there's two of us.

417
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,597
- Hell, yeah.
- Yeah.

418
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,891
- Well, of course.
- Yeah, I can... I can take it.

419
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,185
So take it. Thank you.

420
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,687
Hey, you there!

421
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,565
- Hey, hello!
- Hello!

422
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:16,318
Could you hold on?
I'm with the police.

423
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:21,865
Have you...? I'm looking
for a hundred-year-old man

424
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:26,578
who got lost from
a retirement home in Malmköping.

425
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:27,996
Have you seen some old guy?

426
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,252
Yes, I saw an old guy riding a rail bike
with Johnsson.

427
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,257
- I see. Julius Johnsson?
- Yes, exactly.

428
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:44,304
And a guy in a biker's vest looking
all cocky, wearing sunglasses.

429
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:48,183
The way they do these days.
He didn't even say hello.

430
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:53,313
- Where did you see them?
- By Åkers Styckebruk soccer field.

431
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:58,277
- Was it long ago?
- About half an hour.

432
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,362
Are you certain?

433
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:02,072
No.

434
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,787
Bye.

435
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,260
Hey there.

436
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,138
You wouldn't have room
for two hitchhikers, would you?

437
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,769
- Hello.
- Hello.

438
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,648
Sure, I can do that.

439
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,818
There's not a lot of room here...

440
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,405
We'll put the suitcase in the front.

441
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,617
- Where are you going?
- Do you run the store here?

442
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:51,246
No. God, no.

443
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,958
I just work here.
I'm a student.

444
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:58,420
You're a student?
Not in primary school, I guess.

445
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:02,758
No. I've tried various things.

446
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,302
Studied all sorts of different things.

447
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:11,016
I think it's quite a complex issue,

448
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,561
with career options and the like.

449
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:20,859
- How do you mean?
- Well, there are...

450
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,278
There are different...

451
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,575
That is to say...
The way I see it, it's...

452
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,118
What?

453
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:34,498
I figure that it's difficult
to make decisions about...

454
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:42,047
That's great.
Keep all your options open.

455
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,883
Well, never mind.

456
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,514
- Get in.
- Thanks!

457
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,809
So where are you going?

458
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,314
Well... Where are you going?

459
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:05,153
- I'm going to the warehouse store.
- That sounds nice.

460
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,033
Are you sure?
It's in the middle of nowhere.

461
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,411
Yes. The middle of nowhere
is underrated.

462
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,498
Yeah, I guess it is.

463
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:29,136
Hey, can you mention the sponsor?
That would be awesome.

464
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,220
What?

465
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:34,724
The insurance agency Skandia turns 150
and this guy is 100 years old.

466
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,393
That would be great.

467
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:40,063
As a cop,
you could do something crazy on it.

468
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:43,942
- No, I won't do that.
- But they're both old.

469
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:48,572
- Don't you...? I'm a cop, damn it.
- But it would be great.

470
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:52,325
Give up, already. I said no,
and I work for the government.

471
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:56,163
I can't be advertising
on this damned channel.

472
00:40:56,496 --> 00:41:02,544
Fresh '70s group The Police,
with their song “Message in a Bottle”.

473
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,964
And I have policeman Aronsson here.

474
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,592
- Inspector.
- Welcome.

475
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:12,888
You have a little message
for the public, but not in a bottle.

476
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,475
- No.
- Tell me about that.

477
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:22,147
It's about a man
called Allan Karlsson

478
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,277
<i>who, on his 100th birthday,
left the Malmköping retirement home.</i>

479
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,781
<i>Oh, my. A hundred years, huh?
Is he playing hide and seek, or what?</i>

480
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:35,452
No. He may have been kidnapped

481
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,996
by a biker gang
at the Malmköping station.

482
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,624
Kidnapped? Oh, my.

483
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:42,542
- <i>That sounds like some bachelor party.</i>
- What the hell?

484
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:44,669
<i>Is he going to marry
Anna Nicole Smith, or what?</i>

485
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:49,758
We would be grateful for any tip offs.

486
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,760
Right. Thanks for being here.

487
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,683
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, I'm sitting in the car.

488
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:02,479
Some cop on the radio
is prattling on

489
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:06,525
about some 100-year-old
who was kidnapped by a biker gang.

490
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:09,069
Did they say kidnapped?

491
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,613
Yes, they just said it on the radio.

492
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,198
<i>That has to be Bulten.</i>

493
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,993
Oh, Bulten.
You're a dead man now.

494
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:29,673
- Do you want anything?
- No, that's fine.

495
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,970
100-YEAR-OLD KIDNAPPED
BY BIKER GANG

496
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,988
If you need gas, pull the lever.

497
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,450
You have to pull the lever
to get gasoline.

498
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,537
Pull the lever by the pump.

499
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:07,669
You need to pull the lever by the pump!
Push the handle.

500
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:16,720
Haven't you filled up a car before?
You have to pull the lever.

501
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,848
- Has he kidnapped you?
- What? Who?

502
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:23,393
- Julius.
- What? No.

503
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,353
You have to pull the lever.

504
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:29,482
The headline says
you've been kidnapped by bikers.

505
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,902
Julius was wearing a biker vest.
I just saw it.

506
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:35,405
No, the biker vest isn't his.

507
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:39,826
He took it from that bald kid.

508
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:43,788
- A little kid?
- He doesn't need it now. He's dead.

509
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:46,166
I hit him with a croquet mallet.

510
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:50,211
- Did you kill...?
- No, no. He froze to death.

511
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,172
Okay...?

512
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:57,177
The bald kid came to me,
sweat pouring off his face.

513
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,054
I guess he had the runs.

514
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,807
He was not doing well,
so he handed me the suitcase.

515
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,476
There's 50 million in it.

516
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,145
- What?
- We haven't taken it.

517
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,396
- Drive!
- What is this?

518
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,482
- Hit it!
- He can't pump gas.

519
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,943
- Never mind that. Drive!
- Alright.

520
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,405
Step on it, Benny! Step on it!

521
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,286
The lady at the register saw me.

522
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,747
What did she see?

523
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:30,293
This little bag happened
to drop into my pocket.

524
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:33,213
- You want one?
- Yes, please.

525
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,465
So you shoplifted, eh?

526
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,092
What the hell?

527
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:38,760
What?

528
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,973
What the hell has happened?

529
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,517
I apologize.

530
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,563
Of course you, as a store employee,
get upset when I just grab a...

531
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:54,025
He can't break a million-crown stack
for some candy.

532
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,611
I don't care about the candy!

533
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,948
What have you done? Well?

534
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:07,580
I'll never ask for information
through the radio again.

535
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:11,418
- No, it didn't turn out too well.
- Why do we even do that?

536
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,379
- Åkers Styckebruk called.
- And?

537
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,424
The dog indicated
a corpse on the rail bike.

538
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,509
- A corpse?
- Yes, exactly.

539
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:29,853
Benny, how about you skip the warehouse
store and come with us instead?

540
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,896
Or do you have an exam on Monday?

541
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:37,694
What will you do with the money?

542
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:42,073
I expect we'll split it up.
Right, Julius?

543
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,491
Yeah...

544
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:48,163
We'll have to talk about that later,
because we're not in a good spot.

545
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,248
Please step on it.

546
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:55,378
So... who does the money belong to?

547
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:59,507
You didn't win it in the lottery.

548
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:03,303
<i>So what?
Does anyone really own anything?</i>

549
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:06,181
<i>I mean, everything seems
to change hands sooner or later.</i>

550
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,352
<i>Like that pistol Franco gave me.</i>

551
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,229
<i>I traded it for...</i>

552
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:16,441
<i>for a work permit
when I got to America.</i>

553
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,051
That sounds great to my ears,
I can tell you that.

554
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,453
It's like kissing
a German Shepherd's ass.

555
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,504
<i>And just like that,</i>

556
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,882
<i>my urge to blow things up was back.</i>

557
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:27,095
<i>I have to say,
it was a wonderful feeling.</i>

558
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:28,383
<i>It was that easy to get the bomb going.</i>

559
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:33,721
<i>Everyone was terribly excited.</i>

560
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:38,726
<i>Not least Harry.
The vice president, Harry S. Truman.</i>

561
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,904
Damn, a pee stain.

562
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,662
Whatever you do...

563
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,625
You push and you pull...

564
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,004
but the last drop
still ends up in your pants.

565
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:45,960
<i>A boozed-up American
can talk anyone's head off.</i>

566
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,212
<i>It takes a lot to shut them up.</i>

567
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,842
<i>Something like a president dying.</i>

568
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:02,810
<i>Which is exactly what
President Roosevelt went and did that day.</i>

569
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:07,398
Now, here...

570
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:20,745
<i>Harry didn't mind things
changing hands either.</i>

571
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,086
- Mr. Karlsson?
- Well, Allan.

572
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,922
- Welcome back to Sweden.
- Thank you.

573
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:34,717
Uh, Prime Minister Erlander invites you
to a welcome dinner.

574
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:37,220
<i>I had barely set foot in Sweden</i>

575
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,807
<i>before I was shanghaied
to a dinner at the Grand.</i>

576
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:45,019
<i>Good timing.
The food on the airplane was terrible.</i>

577
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:48,147
- I am pretty hungry.
- Then get in.

578
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:52,944
And one soldier got up and said,
“Duck, everyone! He's reloading!”

579
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:05,665
Harry S. Truman himself
said Allan was a very nice man

580
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:08,209
who has also done much for the US.

581
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:11,379
I don't know about that,
but we had some party.

582
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,256
Tell me. I am terribly curious.

583
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,509
We were drinking tequila.

584
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:21,222
- Loads of tequila.
- I meant what happened before that.

585
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:25,268
Before that? No, we only had
tequila throughout.

586
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:27,603
Harry wanted bourbon,
but that's kid's stuff.

587
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:31,315
Mr. Karlsson, I refer to the work.

588
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:33,818
- When I worked on Manhattan?
- Yes.

589
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,945
You couldn't have tequila then.

590
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,823
That would be lethal.
It goes to your head.

591
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:43,244
Excuse me, I have to leave.
The government is calling.

592
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,912
That is to say, my wife.

593
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,292
Enough of that. The meal's on me.

594
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,919
Tell Engineer Eklund the rest.
Good night.

595
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,797
Bye.

596
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:59,093
The Prime Minister asked me to...

597
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:02,680
- Do you think he'll be back?
- No.

598
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,975
Then I'll take his steak.

599
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,644
It would be a shame
for it to go to waste.

600
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:13,608
The Prime Minister
has asked me to inquire

601
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:18,529
if we might have room for Mr. Karlsson
at the Atomic Energy Commission.

602
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:22,700
- How nice.
- So, how about your studies?

603
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:26,537
Not much to get excited about.
Just three years.

604
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:28,623
Only three years of academic studies?

605
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,459
Yes, I quit when I was nine.

606
00:53:33,044 --> 00:53:36,714
- Nine?
- Yes, nine. Or ten.

607
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,133
I was ten! No, hold on.

608
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:42,220
I turned ten that year.

609
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:44,013
So I was nine when I quit school.

610
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:48,893
Here's a little fella that wants
to jump down my gullet.

611
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,354
You can have his.

612
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:54,899
<i>That guy was gone faster
than shit through a goose.</i>

613
00:53:56,275 --> 00:54:00,196
<i>But he wasn't the only one
at the Grand fishing for my attention.</i>

614
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,093
What the hell...?

615
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:34,647
Stop there, my dear.
You have some nice things.

616
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:36,691
I'll have an akvavit.

617
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,194
Give her a fifty.

618
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,572
Yes, that's fine.

619
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:49,287
This one was mischievous.
I'm starting to feel it now.

620
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,539
I feel great now!

621
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:00,715
I see. You don't say?

622
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:10,725
I see.

623
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,074
Damn...

624
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:35,458
What the hell is that doing here,
inside the archipelago?

625
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,881
We're running out of fuel.

626
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,758
Turn in up here.

627
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,093
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Here?

628
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,600
Sjötorp? A sea hut sounds nice.

629
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,867
Hello!

630
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,370
- Hi.
- Hi.

631
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:16,999
We're wondering
if we could rent a room for the night.

632
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:21,420
This isn't a goddamned hotel.
I live here.

633
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:24,507
But we'll pay you well.

634
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,967
We have money.
That's not an issue.

635
00:56:28,177 --> 00:56:30,763
I see. Are you on the run, or what?

636
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:35,351
It's fine. I get that it seems odd,
us just showing up like this.

637
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:38,562
- Here's another geezer.
- The thing is...

638
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:41,690
- Hi.
- We got a little lost.

639
00:56:41,774 --> 00:56:44,860
- We would be very grateful if...
- Allan.

640
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:47,780
- Hello, you. I'm Gunilla.
- Nice to meet you.

641
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,365
We'll see about that.

642
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,576
I guess I'll have
to squeeze you guys in somehow.

643
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:56,038
But no one pisses himself.
You sleep in the barn if you do.

644
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,167
- What's that?
- Sonja.

645
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:09,760
Look at that.

646
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,599
I see. Well, hello there.

647
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,020
Not bad.

648
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,045
Is she about 40?

649
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:50,217
Sonja? I don't have a clue.

650
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:51,594
Why do you think that?

651
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:55,139
I'm almost a zoologist,
so I think that's right.

652
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:58,350
Almost? How can you be “almost”?

653
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:02,271
Well, I'm almost done.

654
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:05,357
I almost finished my studies.

655
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:09,320
- Where did you find her?
- At a circus.

656
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,948
I see. Does she know any tricks?

657
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:15,367
I honestly don't have a clue.

658
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:18,621
Circuses are just perpetual animal cruelty.

659
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:22,541
Sure, absolutely. I hate circuses too.

660
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:25,628
That was the only good thing my ex did.

661
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:31,425
He saw that I felt for her
and he took care of it.

662
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:49,276
So he just took her?

663
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,947
Took? An elephant owns itself.

664
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:54,615
Yeah...

665
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:05,960
- Allan!
- What?

666
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,671
Hey, you can't do that.

667
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:14,218
- Hold on there!
- The ﬂame was too weak.

668
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,179
It should taste grilled.

669
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:19,723
- What the hell is that?
- French potato salad.

670
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:23,060
I can see that.
I mean that green mess.

671
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:26,146
- Looks tasty.
- It's guacamole.

672
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,650
Are you almost a chef too?

673
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,361
No, almost a dietician.

674
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:36,323
No, you're joking. Cut it out.

675
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:39,285
Sadly, no. I'm almost a lot of things.

676
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:44,498
Almost a veterinarian,
almost an economist.

677
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:48,043
Almost a pharmacologist,
almost a human resources specialist.

678
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:50,004
- What the hell?
- Yeah.

679
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:54,341
You must be almost single as well.
No way have you had time for a woman.

680
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:59,722
No. I mean yes, I am...

681
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,891
I am single. I'm available.

682
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:07,146
- Maybe you were kidding?
- No, but I hope you are.

683
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,981
No, I'm not.

684
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:14,570
In the last 18 years,
I've amassed 920 college credits.

685
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:20,326
- Good lord...
- I have a strong thirst for knowledge.

686
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:25,623
You have to stop lying to yourself,
or everything could go to hell.

687
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:27,207
You could end up with nothing.

688
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,712
That's one possible analysis,
but there are several aspects...

689
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,717
What the hell are you doing here?

690
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,305
What are you doing here?

691
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:48,937
- I wanted to pick some stuff up.
- There's nothing to pick up.

692
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:53,609
Yes, there is.
I just wanted to get my bowls.

693
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:57,780
- What fucking bowls?
- The blue fucking bowls with ﬂowers.

694
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:01,992
You gave them to me for my birthday!
And now you want them?

695
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:04,662
I changed my mind and want my bowls.

696
01:01:04,745 --> 01:01:08,457
Go fuck yourself, Ricky.
Get out of here. You don't belong here.

697
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,672
- Is he a nice fuck?
- Yes, he's nice.

698
01:01:14,755 --> 01:01:18,133
- He's the best. So damned good.
- Sure.

699
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:21,095
Good fingers. We call it “making love”.

700
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,430
Ricky, good to meet you.
Congratulations.

701
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:24,640
Thanks.

702
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,642
Take care.

703
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:40,656
No, turn around. There you go.

704
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,535
Well, no.

705
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,538
Oh, that's no problem. A bit more.

706
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:53,335
- There you go.
- Back up that way.

707
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,087
That's good.

708
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,507
- Just back up a bit more. A little more.
- Yeah, I know.

709
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,801
There you go!

710
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:06,473
Oh, my. He really slipped the clutch.

711
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:11,520
Gunilla! Gunilla!

712
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,690
I don't know what's wrong with me.

713
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:18,694
I always end up with idiots like that.
I attract them.

714
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:23,073
Maybe you know.
I bet you're almost a psychologist.

715
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,868
No, not really.

716
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:31,123
But I don't have too far to go,
I've read the basics.

717
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:35,461
I have neuropsychology left,
but that's a minor course.

718
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:40,758
It's hard to say what the root
of your problem is.

719
01:02:42,009 --> 01:02:44,762
But you can change your behavior.

720
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,306
- If you want to.
- Come on, Benny.

721
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:50,684
You can't pick
who you fall in love with.

722
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:54,146
Sadly, no.

723
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,814
Gunilla!

724
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:59,902
It was you and me! You and me!

725
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:20,964
- Hello?
- Bro!

726
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:23,550
- Hello, Ricky?
- <i>It's over.</i>

727
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:26,345
She's met someone else.

728
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:28,680
Ricky, listen.

729
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:30,557
<i>Fuck that damned chick.</i>

730
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,434
She's no damned chick.

731
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:35,270
- She's Gunilla!
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

732
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:38,774
Stop taking pills
and stop drinking too.

733
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,193
We'll deal with this tomorrow.

734
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,278
<i>- I can't take any more, it's over.</i>
- Get it?

735
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:47,491
She fucked that 100-year-old.
I know she did.

736
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:51,370
What did you say? Hold on, Ricky.
What 100-year-old?

737
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:55,374
- Did you see the 100-year-old?
- <i>That fucking geezer!</i>

738
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:58,669
That guy who was on TV
who is a hundred years old!

739
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,295
<i>Ricky, damn it!</i>

740
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,425
Well...

741
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,888
yesterday I was turning over
a box of matches,

742
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:12,391
alone in my kitchen.

743
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:18,188
Then suddenly, this old guy pops up,
and now I'm here!

744
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:22,359
That's just wonderful!

745
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:25,696
<i>Well, one thing certainly
leads to another.</i>

746
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:28,907
<i>But if that other thing
is better than the first,</i>

747
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:31,785
<i>you could never know in advance.</i>

748
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,328
<i>But I do know</i>

749
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:37,457
<i>that propeller planes,
submarines and vodka do not mix.</i>

750
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:40,544
<i>At all.</i>

751
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,629
Oh, my lord. Hey...

752
01:04:56,810 --> 01:05:00,731
Is that my bachelor party?
How exciting!

753
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,902
But I'm not getting married.

754
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:07,154
I don't even have a girlfriend!

755
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,424
I can well imagine.

756
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:36,058
Why is the new plant in Siberia
not operational yet?

757
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:39,728
Who is responsible for this?
I'm asking you!

758
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:44,066
You morons! Idiots!

759
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,388
Ah, I see.

760
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:17,808
Why not?

761
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:28,318
“Yes, why not? But could I
possibly have a drink first?”.

762
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:38,912
What's he saying? Kalashnikov?

763
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,419
I like the sound of that. Good.

764
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:58,640
Allan, come dance with me!
Allan, dance!

765
01:06:58,724 --> 01:07:01,643
Stop nagging me. You're nuts.

766
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:09,067
- General Franco, the Fascist?
- He just keeps nagging. It's boring.

767
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:11,611
What else is he saying?

768
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,314
Exactly. Listen here...

769
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,075
<i>Well, you can't agree on everything.</i>

770
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:02,579
<i>But most people agree
that a gulag is a real shithole.</i>

771
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,124
<i>But it did lead
to me meeting many new people.</i>

772
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,003
<i>Well, some only superficially.</i>

773
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:13,924
<i>But that's where I met Herbert,
Herbert Einstein.</i>

774
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:17,219
<i>Like I said,
one thing always leads to another.</i>

775
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,096
Hey, idiot!

776
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:21,223
Put the stone back.

777
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:35,779
<i>And the food there...</i>

778
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:39,616
<i>Well, the feed, it was terrible.</i>

779
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:42,285
<i>I didn't see any vodka either.</i>

780
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:45,038
<i>In fact, no booze at all.</i>

781
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:48,500
<i>So one day,
I decided to get out of there</i>

782
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,252
<i>and I had a good plan.</i>

783
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:55,632
<i>Herbert was the only one who could move
around the camp without getting shot.</i>

784
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:59,678
<i>The guards were used to him
just getting lost all the time,</i>

785
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,304
<i>over and over again.</i>

786
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,882
This is just too much.

787
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:51,730
Herbert, pay attention.

788
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:14,502
<i>After a year, I gave up.</i>

789
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:17,380
<i>My plan was obviously
too complex for Herbert.</i>

790
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:19,299
Herbert, let's just drop it.

791
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,095
Damn. What did I do with it?

792
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:25,931
Herbert. Lord. You have to stop.

793
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:31,853
What damned pin?

794
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:35,815
That's a hand grenade.

795
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:50,997
Who goes there?

796
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,541
Stop right now!

797
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,588
Excuse me. We have a problem.
A grenade without the pin.

798
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:02,676
- Throw it!
- Grenade! Grenade!

799
01:11:08,265 --> 01:11:10,684
- Louder!
- Break it up!

800
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,695
<i>I can tell you
that loose rockets behave</i>

801
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,447
<i>like rabbit dicks in springtime.</i>

802
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:26,533
<i>They go every which way.</i>

803
01:11:47,012 --> 01:11:50,223
The fire is spreading
to the military base!

804
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:53,977
<i>The news that the gulag</i>

805
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:57,397
<i>and the entire Pacific ﬂeet
had been wiped out</i>

806
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,816
<i>hit Stalin hard.</i>

807
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,985
<i>He kicked the bucket.</i>

808
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:11,202
Get him out of the bedroom,
into the bathroom and wash him down.

809
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:13,121
Shape the fuck up!
Come on, damn it!

810
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:15,665
- What's the address?
- Stop it!

811
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:17,584
<i>Get it together! Where does she live?</i>

812
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:19,961
<i>Where does the bitch live?</i>

813
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:21,838
Sjötorp.

814
01:12:21,921 --> 01:12:26,092
It's called that because
it's got a lovely lake view.

815
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:30,555
- Did you hear that?
- Step on it, Hinken! Let's go!

816
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:34,934
The amplifier isn't working,
and it's still under warranty.

817
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:38,521
Of course I'll bring it in. Thank you.

818
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:43,193
I was thinking about cadaver dogs.

819
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:46,321
Do they always indicate correctly?

820
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,281
Meaning what? They're cadaver dogs.

821
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:51,743
Right, but... I don't know.

822
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:56,539
After all, Allan is 100 years old.

823
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:57,874
What do you mean?

824
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:01,294
Older people don't smell like we do.

825
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:05,298
A sweeter smell, sort of...

826
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,552
A bit cadaver-like.

827
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:15,058
- Drop it.
- I should think so.

828
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:16,559
Check these guys,

829
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:19,396
Pär-Gunnar “Gäddan” Gördin
and Hans “Hinken” Claesson.

830
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:21,773
I'm busy with the 100-year-old.

831
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:24,317
Same biker gang, Never Again.

832
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,654
- Didn't you read the report?
- Of course I did.

833
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:06,651
Did you swallow wrong?
There you go.

834
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,611
What the hell?

835
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:11,865
Have some grass,
and have some vegetables.

836
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:15,118
I found this cell phone
on the kitchen ﬂoor.

837
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,329
- Is it yours?
- Nope, it's not mine.

838
01:14:19,414 --> 01:14:23,209
It wasn't Gunilla's either.
But it's shut off, so...

839
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:29,132
Well, turn it on, see who called
and figure out whose it is.

840
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:33,178
Yes, but... is that okay?

841
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:37,223
- There you go.
- Thank you.

842
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:42,395
Someone called “Åleg” has called.
“Åleg” again.

843
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,941
Oleg? It's pronounced Oleg,
it's Russian. Young Popov called.

844
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:49,861
- Is this your cell phone?
- Well, I'm afraid it is.

845
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:53,531
- <i>Yes.</i>
- I found the damned geezer.

846
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:57,118
- Great! And the suitcase too?
- I haven't seen it.

847
01:14:57,202 --> 01:15:00,580
- There are people everywhere.
- Just find the bag fast!

848
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:03,208
Yeah, okay.

849
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:05,835
What do you mean?
Is there a problem?

850
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,505
No, I'm just thinking
about this old guy.

851
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:11,424
What do I do about him?

852
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:14,761
Do what you always do: Threaten.

853
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,179
<i>Alright, I'll just threaten.</i>

854
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,723
This is a threat!

855
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:22,852
Do anything
and I'll blow your head off!

856
01:15:22,936 --> 01:15:24,771
The suitcase! Get it!

857
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,649
It's in the room by the kitchen.

858
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:32,028
Get the suitcase, faggot!
Make it fast!

859
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,739
- You mean me?
- I said “faggot”. Move!

860
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,783
I'll shoot the geezer!

861
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,620
And you stay real calm!

862
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,126
Hurry up!

863
01:15:49,546 --> 01:15:51,548
Stop right there.

864
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:55,969
Back up from the suitcase. Back up!

865
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,641
- Hello?
- <i>You're taking your sweet time.</i>

866
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,561
- Did you get the suitcase?
- I'm holding it.

867
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:06,938
Do you have the money?

868
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:08,481
I'll check right now.

869
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:10,400
- You stay calm.
- I am calm.

870
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:12,694
Nice and calm. Good, faggot.

871
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:16,531
Keep calm.
Nice and calm, nice and calm.

872
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:22,579
- It's a crappy suitcase. All plastic.
- Shut up, you wrinkled fuck!

873
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:27,750
- Shit, what a lot of money!
- <i>Great, Hinken!</i>

874
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:31,129
Take the bag and everything,
and get here quick.

875
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:32,964
Scram, you bastard.

876
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,632
Stop or I'll shoot, bitch!

877
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:38,261
- I'll do the shooting, I live here!
- I said stop!

878
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,138
Hinken! What are you doing?

879
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:43,516
Get out, or I'll shoot your head off!
You hear me?

880
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:49,188
Hinken?

881
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:00,325
Damn it... No!

882
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:09,792
Caracas, get the hell up!
Everything has...

883
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:13,838
You're shouting.

884
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:17,967
- Where the hell were you?
- Buying melons. We were out.

885
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:22,513
Hinken just got popped
by the 100-year-old and you just leave?

886
01:17:22,597 --> 01:17:24,474
- Are you kidding?
- You think I'm kidding?

887
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:27,352
Do I look like I'm kidding?

888
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:30,355
Half the team and 50 million gone!

889
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:33,650
- And you go buy fruit!
- Melons are a vegetable.

890
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:36,027
I don't give a fuck
if it's a fruit or vegetable!

891
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,403
That's not the point!

892
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:40,823
Never question me
like you're doing now. Got it?

893
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:42,241
I won't.

894
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:49,040
Where are you going?
Stay! You're not going anywhere.

895
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,209
Stop right there, damn it!

896
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,192
- Did you get all the bullets out?
- One went straight through.

897
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:18,528
Sorry, I should have done something.

898
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:23,241
Like told me about the stolen money!

899
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:24,992
Now I'm involved in all this.

900
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:28,079
I haven't decided if I'm part of it.

901
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:31,582
- Yes, you are, Benny. Help me.
- So he's part of it?

902
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:35,420
- You'll get some cash too, Gunilla.
- Some cash?

903
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:39,090
I'm as involved as any one of you.
I get a quarter.

904
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:42,510
The sun is beating down.
Want to go swimming?

905
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:43,553
- No.
- No.

906
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:47,098
- Julius?
- No goddamned way.

907
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:50,143
- Maybe Sonja wants a swim.
- No, she's not going swimming.

908
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,395
What do we do with this guy?

909
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:55,106
Maybe set fire to the car?

910
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:56,816
Just leave him.

911
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,860
Someone has to do something with him

912
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:04,073
and I seem to be
the only one taking responsibility!

913
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:10,663
So your sense of responsibility
is why this place feels so very safe?

914
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:13,082
I didn't wave a shotgun around.

915
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:16,169
What else was I supposed to do
when he was trying to blow our heads off?

916
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,630
Let's hurry up,
so that we can get out of here.

917
01:19:19,714 --> 01:19:22,967
I'll go swimmming.
Call me if you need me.

918
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:25,678
Where do we pick you up
if you're torching the car?

919
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:29,265
I have no clue yet.

920
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:33,811
Driving around with a stiff...
I don't even know who he is.

921
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:35,480
Neither do I.

922
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:37,815
<i>Well, you never really know.</i>

923
01:19:37,899 --> 01:19:39,358
<i>People can act one way</i>

924
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:43,362
<i>and then turn out
to be somebody else entirely.</i>

925
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:49,118
<i>In the spring of 1968,</i>

926
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:53,790
<i>I went to a party in Paris with Herbert
and his cute little wife.</i>

927
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:57,585
<i>It was held at the home
of that French foreign minister.</i>

928
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:00,963
Ah! Your majesty!
Good evening and welcome.

929
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:03,800
- My husband, Herbert.
- Yes, good to meet you.

930
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:05,802
And his friend Allan Karlsson.

931
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:07,804
Welcome to my place.

932
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:10,681
Jean-Claude, this isn't the right time.

933
01:20:10,765 --> 01:20:14,769
Look at that! It's you!
Are you trying to hide?

934
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:16,312
What are you doing here?

935
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,565
I'm sorry. Have we met?

936
01:20:38,084 --> 01:20:39,919
Man, did we drink. That was fun.

937
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:44,298
- Who are you?
- You know me, Minister.

938
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,092
- Who are you?
- I'm...

939
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:54,183
<i>Vladimir was not just
dressed up for the evening.</i>

940
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:57,520
<i>He'd been in disguise
for years with the minister.</i>

941
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,773
<i>And that made the French quite curious.</i>

942
01:21:00,857 --> 01:21:03,067
Just give us a name!

943
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:07,071
<i>And Ryan Hutton,
from the CIA office in France...</i>

944
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:09,991
<i>He got curious too.</i>

945
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:46,068
Polska is a good dance,
but I prefer the <i>snoa.</i>

946
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,342
Thank you.

947
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:14,055
- I am looking for Popov.
- Over there.

948
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:15,640
Thank you.

949
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:23,814
The “old man grip”.

950
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:28,027
Did you switch to the old man grip?

951
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:35,117
Oh, look at this.
Why are you here?

952
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:38,245
My dear, how many years. May I?

953
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:46,963
- This is my son, Oleg.
- Your youngest.

954
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:50,424
- American cowboy boots.
- Oleg, stop it.

955
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:54,637
- Yes, they're nice.
- Can I have them. Please?

956
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,556
- Oleg, please stop.
- I'll give him mine.

957
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,811
- What did I tell you?
- Take this. It's also American.

958
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:08,526
There's no need...

959
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,488
- Oleg, what do you say?
- Thank you.

960
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:15,116
No problem. Enjoy.

961
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:19,412
So, my friend,
what are you doing in Moscow?

962
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:24,500
The CIA have a problem
so they asked me to help.

963
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:28,337
I thought perhaps you could...

964
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:31,173
- What the hell is this?
- Wash your hands.

965
01:23:31,257 --> 01:23:35,052
- I just did.
- Do it again!

966
01:24:11,172 --> 01:24:13,257
Ryan Hutton, you say?

967
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,761
- So you met at the CIA's Paris office?
- Yes, yes, yes.

968
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:20,056
Can you get any interesting
information from them?

969
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,850
Not entirely unlikely.

970
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:27,021
<i>Hutton loved all that crap
from the Russians.</i>

971
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:46,665
<i>Suddenly I was a double agent, a spy.</i>

972
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:53,839
<i>Well, maybe not a spy. There was never
anything classified in that bag.</i>

973
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:59,929
<i>Both the Russians and the Americans
emptied their trash cans straight into it.</i>

974
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:04,308
<i>It still caused a bit of a ruckus...
and a few deaths.</i>

975
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:07,228
<i>Well, shit happens.</i>

976
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:10,397
I see.

977
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:16,445
Thank you.

978
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,463
Good day.

979
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:37,341
Hey, can't you just...?

980
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,639
What? Oh, really?

981
01:26:13,961 --> 01:26:16,630
<i>There you go.
Sometimes people act one way,</i>

982
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:20,092
<i>then turn out
to be somebody else entirely.</i>

983
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:25,764
<i>Take America's new president,
Ronald Reagan.</i>

984
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:28,934
<i>He looked like a real rascal,
which he was.</i>

985
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:31,812
<i>So maybe the rule
doesn't apply to everyone.</i>

986
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:27,159
This recording
only reaffirms my suspicions.

987
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:33,457
He's terrified
we'll tear the wall down.

988
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:36,835
He knows that if we do

989
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:40,464
then the Russian people
will bring down the world

990
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,759
and take it without any weapons.

991
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:49,640
<i>A whole world waits...</i>

992
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:52,559
<i>When my old friend Popov
kicked the bucket,</i>

993
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:55,145
<i>I hung up my briefcase for good.</i>

994
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:59,275
<i>But his son kept in touch.</i>

995
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:01,944
Such a shame,

996
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:05,656
breaking down a big wall with hoes
and bare hands when there's dynamite.

997
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:08,701
- A toast to Father.
- Cheers.

998
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:14,290
Ridiculous.

999
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:17,376
The East has all those cannons,
but they hack away at it.

1000
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:33,851
What's that? He...

1001
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:36,312
Hello?

1002
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:40,899
Do you stop picking up the phone
once you turn one hundred?

1003
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:42,443
Is this Oleg?

1004
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:46,572
I gave you the phone to keep with you.

1005
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:52,244
- <i>Yes, you did.</i>
- Okay. Happy birthday.

1006
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:56,999
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- Going for an afternoon swim.

1007
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:59,710
<i>A swim? You're such a character.</i>

1008
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:02,963
Did you party hard?

1009
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:04,673
And what are you doing tonight?

1010
01:29:05,174 --> 01:29:10,637
Evidently we're ﬂeeing. So they say.

1011
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:12,431
- Fleeing?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1012
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:16,852
Some people died, now we're ﬂeeing.

1013
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:20,856
Hurry the fuck up, Benny.
We have to get out of here.

1014
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,859
We need to pack food and clothing...

1015
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:26,695
- Did Julius call yet?
- No.

1016
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:42,419
- Did you find anything?
- What?

1017
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:45,798
- About the 100-year-old.
- Oh! No, no, no...

1018
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:50,135
We found that Hinken Claesson
has a brother in the area.

1019
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,845
- Really?
- His name's Ricky.

1020
01:29:51,929 --> 01:29:55,516
He's evidently seen the 100-year-old
at a place called Sjötorp.

1021
01:29:55,599 --> 01:29:57,309
- I see.
- Check that out.

1022
01:29:57,393 --> 01:29:58,811
Sure.

1023
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:51,947
God fucking damn it!

1024
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:10,799
So he's Russian, this “Åleg”?

1025
01:31:10,883 --> 01:31:15,262
Oleg. Yes, he is.
He travels all over the world.

1026
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:17,347
Does he have any references?

1027
01:31:17,848 --> 01:31:20,267
What? References?

1028
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:23,312
It's Popov's son.
I've known him for a long time.

1029
01:31:23,395 --> 01:31:26,857
Isn't it enough that he wants to help?

1030
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:30,319
Do you have some post-graduate
you'd rather call?

1031
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:31,904
Someone who wrote a paper on this:

1032
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:35,115
“Chased by Dangerous Bikers 101”?

1033
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,159
What an idiot driver.

1034
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:39,244
What a narrow fucking road.

1035
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:55,427
Damn it. Now I'll fucking show them.

1036
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:03,310
Oh, my. He's really going fast.

1037
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,987
- What the hell is he doing?
- Stop! Stop!

1038
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:21,119
Come on, stop! No!

1039
01:32:32,923 --> 01:32:36,593
That's what I call a roundabout.
Boy, did he ﬂy.

1040
01:32:36,677 --> 01:32:38,011
Will that be all?

1041
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:41,765
A gas can.

1042
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:45,310
- With gas.
- Do you have your own can?

1043
01:32:46,687 --> 01:32:48,689
- No.
- No?

1044
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:52,776
- And a lighter.
- Right. One of these?

1045
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:58,156
Yes. We're having a barbecue.
Some meat.

1046
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:03,161
I'm mad about barbecuing.
It's the season for it.

1047
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:06,331
Yeah. That's true.

1048
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,419
What is... What...?

1049
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:12,879
Fuck!

1050
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:19,761
Well, god damn it!

1051
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:22,681
He doesn't seem very talkative.

1052
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:26,143
Too bad, he seemed very eager.

1053
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,853
Damn!

1054
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:33,650
- Is he alive?
- Barely. His head is gushing blood.

1055
01:33:33,734 --> 01:33:35,569
Hello?

1056
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:53,420
What the hell is this?

1057
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:07,851
Get in quick, damn it.

1058
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:09,728
What is wrong with people?

1059
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:15,025
Stealing a car in broad daylight.
They should be locked up.

1060
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:20,113
He'll get a big surprise
when he checks the trunk.

1061
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:22,991
Don't we have any compresses?
I must use something...

1062
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:25,160
- What's happened?
- Use the curtains or something.

1063
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:28,664
- I can't use anything that's dirty.
- Who is that? Who is that?

1064
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:31,583
He was in a collision...

1065
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:33,669
- But who is it?
- Laying there bleeding.

1066
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:38,006
- Hello? Can someone tell me who he is?
- Top drawer, Benny!

1067
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:40,676
- He tried to shoot us.
- Shoot at you?

1068
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:44,680
Yes, and when he wakes up,
he's getting his suitcase back.

1069
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:48,684
Give away 50 million?

1070
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:50,185
Are you insane?

1071
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,312
- This thing never ends.
- It's not your money.

1072
01:34:52,396 --> 01:34:54,898
He tried to shoot us. It's not worth it!

1073
01:34:54,981 --> 01:34:59,277
- They want to give away our money.
- It's not our money, damn it.

1074
01:35:00,696 --> 01:35:02,447
- Which way are we going?
- I'm hungry.

1075
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:05,242
- I don't know.
- Can you call Oleg now, Allan?

1076
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:11,957
There's blood,
and I am holding a shell casing.

1077
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,709
Yes, yes.

1078
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:16,962
What?

1079
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:20,966
Yes, of course you have
to send forensics here.

1080
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:25,011
He's waking up now.
He's waking up.

1081
01:35:27,097 --> 01:35:31,476
Here's your goddamned suitcase,
and now leave us the hell alone.

1082
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:34,813
What?

1083
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:37,733
The suitcase you've been looking for.

1084
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:42,612
There. We won't call the cops.
Just go and leave us alone.

1085
01:35:42,696 --> 01:35:44,364
My suitcase?

1086
01:35:44,448 --> 01:35:48,285
You were chasing us down.

1087
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:52,998
I think the three of us
should have a talk right now.

1088
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:54,666
One moment.

1089
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:03,258
It's <i>memoria damnum</i>, memory loss.

1090
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:07,637
Lots of people had that at the home.
It's awful. And bed sores.

1091
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:11,725
- How long can you have <i>pro memoria</i>?
- <i>Memoria damnum.</i>

1092
01:36:11,808 --> 01:36:16,605
A few hours or days, or the rest
of your life if you're unlucky.

1093
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:19,524
Just drop him here
and the suitcase next to him.

1094
01:36:19,608 --> 01:36:22,694
Hey, I'm not giving 50 million

1095
01:36:22,778 --> 01:36:25,739
to someone
who doesn't even know it's his.

1096
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,365
That's where I draw the line!

1097
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:37,501
Hello?

1098
01:37:08,323 --> 01:37:09,658
Hello, Allan here.

1099
01:37:22,254 --> 01:37:23,463
I see...

1100
01:37:34,516 --> 01:37:37,769
He told me I was meat.

1101
01:37:38,103 --> 01:37:39,604
Who was that?

1102
01:37:40,272 --> 01:37:42,524
He never said.

1103
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:46,403
He made sure to say that he was
going to do all sorts of killing.

1104
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,780
Kill us?

1105
01:38:01,293 --> 01:38:03,837
Yes. Good lord.

1106
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,923
I know that orienteers
are trustworthy...

1107
01:38:07,007 --> 01:38:10,343
but you must know it leads nowhere.

1108
01:38:10,427 --> 01:38:12,762
It's such an obvious crank call.

1109
01:38:12,846 --> 01:38:15,348
An old guy and an elephant
in the woods?

1110
01:38:15,432 --> 01:38:17,893
We're throwing out that guy
and his suitcase!

1111
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:20,437
Pack that crap, because we're...

1112
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,856
I'm getting out of here!

1113
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:25,650
- Stop, Gunilla.
- I'll pack it up...

1114
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:29,070
First you were all about
an even share for everyone.

1115
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:32,240
Solidarity with other people's money.

1116
01:38:32,324 --> 01:38:34,910
Now no one gets a vote anymore.

1117
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,995
So what do you want, Benny?
What do you think?

1118
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,748
You want to die here?
Because that's what's going to happen.

1119
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:42,626
No, I don't. I want to live.

1120
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:47,672
What kind of question is that?

1121
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:57,098
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Allan, it's Oleg!</i>

1122
01:38:57,182 --> 01:38:59,100
- Oleg!
- <i>Listen.</i>

1123
01:38:59,184 --> 01:39:02,228
<i>We'll be landing soon.
We've already started our descent.</i>

1124
01:39:02,812 --> 01:39:06,107
<i>Can you tell me where we'll be ﬂying?</i>

1125
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:08,860
<i>We need to get landing permits.</i>

1126
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:11,613
One minute, Oleg.

1127
01:39:11,988 --> 01:39:13,740
- Gäddan.
- Yes?

1128
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:17,452
Where do you think we should go?
We can go wherever we want.

1129
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,329
- I don't know.
- Well,

1130
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:22,874
just say the first thing
that comes to mind.

1131
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:28,463
- Bali.
- That's good.

1132
01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:31,466
- Is that a place?
- It's a damned island.

1133
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:34,052
Uh, hello! Bali!

1134
01:39:41,768 --> 01:39:44,145
Behind the cinder storage unit? What?

1135
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:49,567
Excuse me, but that sounds
a little odd to me.

1136
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:51,528
Yes, but...

1137
01:39:51,611 --> 01:39:54,489
Well, I have the right
to express an opinion.

1138
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:58,076
Yes, I'll take it.
Yes, yes. I'll go there.

1139
01:40:21,683 --> 01:40:24,477
- Hello?
- You were right all along.

1140
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:27,647
These sidetracks had nothing to do
with the 100-year-old.

1141
01:40:27,731 --> 01:40:28,815
What?

1142
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:34,112
Andrén did an international search
and Bulten and Hinken were both found.

1143
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:38,199
<i>- Bulten is in Djibouti.</i>
- What is that?

1144
01:40:38,283 --> 01:40:41,161
A small East African state, evidently.

1145
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:43,538
Africa? What is he...?

1146
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:46,875
- How did he end up there?
- <i>No idea.</i>

1147
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:20,825
- Do they have DNA proof that it's him?
- <i>Not yet.</i>

1148
01:41:20,909 --> 01:41:24,370
That suicide bomber
turned the entire square to hash.

1149
01:41:24,454 --> 01:41:28,750
I see. And what about Hinken?

1150
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:33,046
<i>Found in Riga,
dead inside a car crusher.</i>

1151
01:41:55,235 --> 01:41:58,279
Didn't you say he was shot in Sjötorp?

1152
01:41:58,363 --> 01:42:01,741
- <i>There was blood there.</i>
- That was elephant blood.

1153
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,702
- Elephant blood?
- <i>Well...</i>

1154
01:42:04,786 --> 01:42:08,456
Hinken had no bullet wounds,
only trauma from the car crusher.

1155
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:12,293
<i>Forensics say there was only
elephant blood at Sjötorp.</i>

1156
01:42:12,377 --> 01:42:15,672
And this guy Gäddan, where did he go?

1157
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:19,008
<i>Nothing connects him
to the 100-year-old.</i>

1158
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:22,137
He's wanted, but that has nothing
to do with us. Let's drop it.

1159
01:42:23,096 --> 01:42:25,890
So we have nothing on them?

1160
01:42:25,974 --> 01:42:28,143
Nope. Nothing criminal anyway.

1161
01:42:28,935 --> 01:42:31,396
This is just incredible.

1162
01:42:32,063 --> 01:42:36,484
I have the 100-year-old in front of me
right now, with an elephant.

1163
01:42:36,568 --> 01:42:38,653
Oh, you don't say?

1164
01:42:38,736 --> 01:42:41,698
Ask him if he wants
a ride back to the retirement home.

1165
01:42:41,781 --> 01:42:45,410
Forget it. No way. No.

1166
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:49,330
<i>Just drop all this now.</i>

1167
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:53,001
Okay, I will. I'll drop it.

1168
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:56,379
<i>Go ahead,
but I still have to say</i>

1169
01:42:56,462 --> 01:43:01,217
that you've done a great job.
A really great job.

1170
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:03,219
<i>So, see you Monday.</i>

1171
01:43:03,303 --> 01:43:05,930
See you Monday, okay.

1172
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:07,891
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

1173
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:43,593
Ow! You've bandaged it too tight.

1174
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:45,720
It needs to be tight.

1175
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:48,973
You're cutting off my circulation.

1176
01:43:49,057 --> 01:43:52,810
- Then do it yourself.
- No, no, no. I want you to do it.

1177
01:43:52,894 --> 01:43:55,855
Even if you suck at it.

1178
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:05,156
100-YEAR-OLD STILL MISSING

1179
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:25,236
Hello?

1180
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:39,459
<i>What do you mean, piss? Hello?</i>

1181
01:45:40,668 --> 01:45:42,587
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

1182
01:45:48,259 --> 01:45:51,179
I wonder why we humans
are drawn to the sea.

1183
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,765
I think it's the feeling of freedom.

1184
01:45:59,187 --> 01:46:00,813
What a crash!

1185
01:46:04,484 --> 01:46:07,028
Lovely island, Bali.

1186
01:46:24,462 --> 01:46:27,006
Well, god damn...

1187
01:46:32,011 --> 01:46:33,805
Yeah.

1188
01:46:52,365 --> 01:46:56,160
- Did you get malaria already?
- What?

1189
01:46:56,577 --> 01:46:58,371
You're as white as a sheet.

1190
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:04,752
Things are kind of a mess right now.
But I don't know.

1191
01:47:04,836 --> 01:47:08,005
Come on. She wants you.

1192
01:47:09,507 --> 01:47:13,719
I know. And that's the thing.

1193
01:47:15,513 --> 01:47:20,768
It's getting serious
and I have to make up my mind.

1194
01:47:20,852 --> 01:47:23,354
I'll get one more for each of us.

1195
01:47:31,779 --> 01:47:35,741
- Not everyone gets that.
- What do you mean?

1196
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:40,079
I mean, to have what you two have.

1197
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:44,375
Few are that lucky.

1198
01:47:47,128 --> 01:47:50,590
Just go and tell her.

1199
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,800
That not everyone is that lucky?

1200
01:47:52,884 --> 01:47:55,761
Why do you have to make
everything so difficult?

1201
01:47:58,014 --> 01:47:59,390
Go down there.

1202
01:48:01,392 --> 01:48:03,394
Well, I...

1203
01:48:03,478 --> 01:48:07,815
I was thinking more about what...

1204
01:48:10,193 --> 01:48:11,194
No...

1205
01:48:13,488 --> 01:48:15,239
- Hello.
- Hello.

1206
01:48:28,044 --> 01:48:31,631
<i>Well, not everyone is that lucky.</i>

1207
01:48:32,924 --> 01:48:34,634
<i>You never know.</i>

1208
01:48:35,718 --> 01:48:37,595
<i>There's always tomorrow.</i>

1209
01:48:38,471 --> 01:48:43,059
- What the hell did you tell him, Allan?
- Why is she screaming at you?

1210
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:47,813
<i>Well, many people have screamed
at me through the years,</i>

1211
01:48:48,397 --> 01:48:51,984
<i>from conductors, to dictators.</i>

1212
01:48:52,693 --> 01:48:56,447
<i>The very first person
to scream at me was my mother.</i>

1213
01:48:56,531 --> 01:49:00,034
<i>I don't remember it, but I'm sure she did.</i>

1214
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:02,787
<i>I'm sure I screamed too.</i>

1215
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:06,874
<i>I guess that is what babies do
when they arrive in the world.</i>

1216
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:10,836
<i>I didn't get much time
to hear my father scream.</i>
