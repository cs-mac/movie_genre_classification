{49633}{49682}Wow.
{49720}{49849}Hey, officer, how do you like|following a guy that sells tvs?
{49851}{49934}About as much as I like|following a guy who steals them.
{49988}{50094}I'm not following anyone.|I'm going to fort pastor to get my brother.
{50156}{50226}'They seem to need to feed on warm flesh.

{51242}{51341}Your mom's dead. Your brother.|That fat chick at dairy queen.
{51372}{51432}Dead.
{51489}{51542}- Yeah.|- 'God bless america.'
{51544}{51593}That sucks too.
{51622}{51681}'Hell is overflowing
{51683}{51777}'and satan is sending his dead to us.
{51820}{51864}'Why?
{51866}{51927}'Because
{51929}{51980}'you have sex out of wedlock,
{52042}{52106}'you kill unborn children,
{52158}{52248}'you have man-on-man relations,

{56497}{56556}Cos if it is, i'm fucked.
{56579}{56647}I'm serious. I've done some bad things.
{56706}{56780}Oh, I get it. You saw hell yesterday,
{56782}{56884}now you're scared of going to hell|for all the bad things you've done.

{59218}{59266}Oh, and shooting guns.
{59268}{59388}We might let the wrong ones in.|Then i'm dead. And I don't want to die.

{64502}{64598}Help? You hear that from the same jackass|who said to go to st. Verbena?
{64600}{64646}- The church downtown?|- Yeah.
{64648}{64784}It's the first place I went. Some dipshit on|the radio said it was safe. He was wrong.
{64786}{64824}That's where you got them?
{64826}{64940}I got a call on the cb from glen|saying these folks were in the chapel.
{64966}{65030}- He's a priest?|- No, he plays the organ.
{65032}{65107}I was in the neighborhood so I picked them up.
{65135}{65200}- Well done.|- Thanks.
{65202}{65308}Excuse me, when you two fellows|are done blowing each other,
{65310}{65380}maybe davy crockett can tell us the deal.
{65406}{65451}Since the tvs went down...
{65453}{65542}- excuse me. Whose rig is that?|- It's mine.
{65544}{65623}- You mind if I borrow it?|- I'm not using it.
{65625}{65684}- Keys?|- They're in the cab.
{65686}{65811}- The truck won't make it to fort pastor.|- Forget it. That place is fucked.
{65813}{65877}- Bloodbath city.|- How do you know?
{65879}{65944}We just came from there.
{65946}{66008}- Is everyone there dead?|- Dead-ish.
{66048}{66116}- Is everyone there dead?|- Yeah.
{66118}{66220}In the sense that|they all sort of fell down and then...
{66222}{66276}- I have to see.|- You won't make it.
{66278}{66332}...got up and...|- i'll get as far as I can.
{66334}{66396}One foot.|... started eating each other.
{66398}{66466}- I'll take my chances.|- Don't be an idiot.
{66522}{66592}Please. The people here could use your help.
{66638}{66705}Fuck y'all.
{66767}{66866}It's nice to see|you've all bonded through this disaster.
{66982}{67038}(distant snarling)
{68578}{68675}- Hey. You need anything?|- No, we're fine.
{68677}{68729}He's got a bite on his hand.
{68896}{68970}- She's cold.|- (wheezing)
{68972}{69037}That's good, right?
{69039}{69100}I don't know. It's weird.
{69102}{69172}An infection this bad|usually comes with a fever.
{69219}{69308}That guy's arm looks pretty bad.|You should check it out.
{69310}{69417}- (wheezing and moaning)|- All right. Stay with her for a minute.
{69518}{69595}- Let me take a look at that.|- I'm fine, really.
{69597}{69726}They don't hurt much. Tucker could use you|more than me. His ankle's cut pretty bad.
{69728}{69786}I'll just clean it up a bit.
{69788}{69842}- You ok?|- (wheezing gasp)
{69844}{69921}Ma'am, can I get you something?|Like a glass of water?
{69923}{69986}(wheezing gasps)
{70029}{70084}Anal ana, come here!
{70699}{70738}anyone know her name?
{70814}{70863}Died without a name?
{70887}{70934}Damn.
{70936}{70996}You wanna use the other room?
{71112}{71160}Holy shit!
{71246}{71300}(shrieking roar)
{71369}{71427}- (squelch)|- (grunts)
{71429}{71493}(panting)
{71522}{71566}Holy shit.
{71615}{71664}Holy shit.
{71774}{71833}I think it's the bites.
{71835}{71938}Frank said she was walking on her own|five hours ago.
{71940}{72017}The bites killed her.|The bites brought her back.
{72019}{72053}How do you know?
{72055}{72152}I watched it happen.|I felt her pulse, she was gone. Then...
{72167}{72216}yesterday I saw the same thing.
{72274}{72333}I think that's why it spread so fast.
{72401}{72449}All right.
{72501}{72560}So who else in the group is bitten?
{72562}{72636}- Frank for sure.|- And the one with the foot?
{72638}{72708}Tucker? He says no, he fell.
{72710}{72770}So it's frank. Tall guy, right?
{72772}{72844}Right. So we have to quarantine him.
{72846}{72892}Where do we do that?
{72894}{72950}There must be a place in here.
{72952}{73011}Then what?
{73013}{73060}I don't know. But...
{73078}{73138}it's too dangerous to keep him here.
{73228}{73322}What are we talking about?|Are we talking about killing him?
{73324}{73389}You'd rather wait for him to die|and then he kills us?
{73391}{73470}Yes. No. You can't kill him.|He's got a daughter!
{73472}{73523}i'm sorry.
{73542}{73594}There's no other choice.
{73657}{73704}He's right.
{73758}{73804}Michael, no. What if i'm wrong?
{73806}{73862}You've seen it happen before.
{73952}{73997}Frank.
{73999}{74048}Michael's coming to shoot you.
{74072}{74152}- What?|- You're infected.
{74154}{74221}You're going to become one of them.
{74251}{74312}(frank) is this true?
{74314}{74376}Are you here to kill me?
{74378}{74472}- You were bitten. It's only a matter of time.|- No. No. No.
{74474}{74568}Leave my dad alone. Go away.|You can't do this.
{74609}{74695}You have to understand|that she's lost everyone.
{74720}{74795}Her mother, her two brothers.
{74842}{74897}I'm all she's got.
{74974}{75050}Well, michael, what are you waiting for?
{75052}{75121}- Go ahead. Kill him.|- (daughter sobbing)
{75154}{75245}- Hey, kill tucker, too.|- Wait a minute. I was never bit.
{75247}{75316}We can't be sure. Do it, michael.
{75370}{75432}Are you sure it's the bite?
{75434}{75492}No.
{75494}{75553}She's sure.
{75670}{75719}I'm sorry.
{76378}{76443}- Hey.|- Hi.
{76445}{76501}- Are you ok?|- Mm.
{76503}{76556}Let me see your arm.
{76558}{76599}It hurts.
{76601}{76653}It's already starting to heal.
{76655}{76726}Andre, I can't have baby here.
{76728}{76818}Why not? People have had babies|for millions of years,
{76820}{76886}all on their own, no hospitals.
{76888}{76957}- Wait.|- Oh, yeah.
{76959}{77010}- It's moving.|- I felt it.
{77012}{77069}We gotta come up with a name.
{77071}{77150}- I want russian name.|- Don't start that. African name.
{77152}{77238}- Please?|- Come here and give me a hug.
{77390}{77443}(frank) sweetie.
{77469}{77526}I'm so proud.
{77620}{77698}I couldn't ask for anything more in a daughter.
{77930}{77979}(frank) I love you.
{78039}{78088}I love you too.
{78238}{78298}- Time to go, honey.|- No.
{78300}{78359}(whimpering)
{78397}{78457}(sniffs)
{79368}{79426}Terry, come on. Open the door.

{109613}{109686}But that's not what I was really feeling.
{109688}{109799}In the back of my mind,|I was always saying, "better them than me."

{110179}{110229}I don't want to die here.
{110391}{110453}I saw a couple of buses in the garage.

{110709}{110826}and hop in my boat and take it|for a pleasure cruise, you jackasses.
{110845}{110953}Wait. There's islands in the lakes,|there's not a lot of people on them.
{110955}{111001}I was kidding.

{111347}{111427}We have to pick up andy.|He's part of the group.
{111429}{111557}Excuse me. Not to shit on anyone's riff|but let me see if I grasp this concept.
{111559}{111677}You're saying we take the parking shuttles,|reinforce them with aluminum siding
{111679}{111724}and then head to the gun store
{111726}{111829}where our friend andy plays some|cowboy-movie, jump-on-the-wagon bullshit.
{111831}{111937}Then we drive across a ruined city|through thousands of dead cannibals,
{111939}{112040}all so we can sail off into the sunset|on this fucking asshole's boat?
{112042}{112126}And head for some island|which may not even exist?
{112151}{112259}- Yeah.|- Pretty much, yeah.
