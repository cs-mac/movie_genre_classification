1
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,725
<i>Fear...</i>

2
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,920
<i>a little death that consumes you.</i>

3
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:21,198
<i>From the common to the abstract,
everyone is scared of something.</i>

4
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,267
I got a cockroach.
Somebody kill it. Somebody kill it.

5
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,669
Somebody kill it. Kill it. Ohh!

6
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:31,541
<i>I was always taught
you had to live with it, accept it.</i>

7
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:34,177
<i>I watched as others fought back.</i>

8
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:38,815
<i>Agoraphobia, nyctophobia,
hydrophobia, acrophobia.</i>

9
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:42,152
<i>There are literally thousands
of classified phobias.</i>

10
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:46,056
<i>I figured out a way to give
my patients a fresh start</i>

11
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:51,128
<i>without the inhibitions and restrictions
their phobias had placed in their lives.</i>

12
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:55,698
Oh, the chamber here animates your phobias
in the form of hallucinations.

13
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:57,667
No!

14
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:01,704
<i>Total immersive exposure therapy,</i>

15
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,338
<i>that's where I went...</i>

16
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:09,913
<i>pushed to the edge of science
and sensory deprivation.</i>

17
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:13,516
<i>We had the technology
to find a cure all along,</i>

18
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,586
<i>but everyone else was blind to it.</i>

19
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:21,655
<i>Smarter men than me all failed,
but not me.</i>

20
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,295
<i>My agenda was pure,</i>

21
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,798
<i>and I figured out the key
hiding in plain sight,</i>

22
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,701
<i>which they all had overlooked,</i>

23
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:34,698
<i>the amygdala,</i>

24
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:37,974
<i>the portion of the brain
which feels fear.</i>

25
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:43,946
<i>Everyone else had danced around it
and treated it like something sacred,</i>

26
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:47,750
<i>but I took a slightly
different approach.</i>

27
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,754
<i>The amygdala also acts
as a kind of projector</i>

28
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:55,257
<i>in which the signal
can easily be received</i>

29
00:02:55,557 --> 00:02:58,526
<i>and, most of all, bounced back.</i>

30
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:03,831
<i>It was working.</i>

31
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:08,805
<i>Round after round,
I was fighting fear and winning.</i>

32
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:11,174
No!

33
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:14,985
<i>Some of my colleagues tried
to debunk my theories, calling me insane,</i>

34
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:18,879
<i>dangerous, outrageous,
but they were just jealous.</i>

35
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,626
<i>But something, something went wrong.</i>

36
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,537
Now close your eyes,

37
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,339
and just concentrate

38
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:47,074
on the sound of my voice.

39
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,690
Which one do you want? Strawberry?
Vanilla? Chocolate? What?

40
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,290
- Vanilla.
- Vanilla?

41
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,146
Don't do this. Please don't...

42
00:04:54,744 --> 00:04:56,177
Talk to me.

43
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,516
I need you to tell me

44
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,949
what you see.

45
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,988
Nothing.

46
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,755
Tell me what you see.

47
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:14,297
A door.

48
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:16,799
Good.

49
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,466
Is it the door to the diner?

50
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,305
I don't think so.

51
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,740
That's it, Paige.

52
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:27,644
Focus on the sound of my voice.

53
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:32,046
Paige, you're not listening to me.
Focus!

54
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:36,887
Paige...

55
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:39,289
...focus!

56
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,524
That's it, Paige.

57
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:44,961
- No.
- Focus on the sound of my voice.

58
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:45,995
I'm scared.

59
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:50,767
- Paige.
- No!

60
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:54,637
Paige, it's just a hallucination.
All you need to do is open your eyes.

61
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,172
Let me in.

62
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,441
Paige! Paige!

63
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,310
Open the door.

64
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,912
All you need to do is open your eyes.

65
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:06,082
Open your eyes, Paige.
Paige, open your eyes!

66
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:14,422
Paige. Paige!

67
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:16,791
Paige!

68
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:37,279
Sara. Sara, are your lights out, too?

69
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,276
I'm fine.

70
00:07:40,876 --> 00:07:43,379
Really? Why, 'cause you lit
a couple candles?

71
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:47,784
You know what? I think I have bedbugs.
Could you check my neck? It's really itchy.

72
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,018
I feel like I can feel them
crawling on me. It's just gross.

73
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,793
- Right there.
- Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax.

74
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,929
- Damn it.
- Nothing.

75
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,898
- Really?
- Nothing except lice.

76
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:04,965
Oh, fuck you.
Why don't you light some more candles?

77
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:07,201
Shut up.

78
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,276
So you got your hot date over there?

79
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,612
He's warm enough, I guess.

80
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:19,331
Remember that friend of his
I told you about?

81
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:21,811
- No, I don't.
- You don't know what you're missing.

82
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:28,086
No! Just let me finish grad school
and worry about all of that other stuff.

83
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:31,594
- It's all about sacrifices.
- Sacrifices for the greater good.

84
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:33,530
I know. You can spare me
the speech. Thank you.

85
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,401
Shut up. I'll have the last laugh when I'm
a horribly underpaid teaching assistant.

86
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:41,137
Thank God.

87
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,474
Now get out, itchy bitch.
I have school in the morning.

88
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,416
- You could teach this kid a thing or two.
- Get out.

89
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:49,879
- What?
- Get out! Come on.

90
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:54,116
Oh, come on. He's kind of hot
and edgy and dark.

91
00:08:54,216 --> 00:08:56,250
I know you like 'em dark.

92
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,489
The darker, the better, bitch.

93
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:25,846
Okay.

94
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:40,362
Oh, God.

95
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:41,895
God.

96
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,339
Hello?

97
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:02,612
It's not my fucking job!

98
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,748
I'm not a fucking magician

99
00:11:05,848 --> 00:11:07,715
or mortician. I am...

100
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:12,140
Osborn, are you fucking nuts?

101
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:15,591
For the past few days,
I have gone above and beyond.

102
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:17,972
I... yeah. Well, you know,

103
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:20,763
it's just a matter of time
before the checks start fucking bouncing.

104
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,006
- Hey.
- <i>Oh, my God. Where the fuck are you?</i>

105
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,942
I'm... I'm at the clinic.

106
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,211
<i>Please tell me
you're getting an abortion.</i>

107
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:39,615
Look, I'm sure I'm fine.
I just... I wanted to talk to Andover.

108
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:42,418
<i>What, you couldn't call?
You had to drive 4 hours?</i>

109
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:45,254
Yeah, well, the place looks like shit.

110
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:47,490
I'm not sure the fear business
is doing too well.

111
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,626
<i>And I overheard Bauer on the phone.
I think that something happened here.</i>

112
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:54,130
<i>God, I hate that convict creep.
He's so rapey.</i>

113
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,100
<i>Listen to this shit. I saw this article
about this bug from Japan.</i>

114
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,736
<i>It flies and shoots acid into your eyes.</i>

115
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,506
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
I'll be home later.

116
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,039
Great.

117
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,551
Hello?

118
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,244
Dr. Andover?

119
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,308
Dr. Andover?

120
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:51,387
Now, we discussed how important it is

121
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:53,989
for you to revisit these images, right?

122
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:58,828
Okay, just concentrate
on the sound of my voice,

123
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,529
and breathe.

124
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:02,515
Stop!

125
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:06,247
Sara, it's not real!

126
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:15,778
Dr. Andover?

127
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:34,797
Dr. Andover.

128
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:36,663
We're closed.

129
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,739
Come on. Come on. You're okay.

130
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:50,868
Come on.

131
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,115
It's okay. Come on.

132
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:54,250
Come on. Come on.

133
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:10,132
Yo! Yo, can I get some help over here?

134
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,969
- Excuse me?
- Yo, lady, I just drove 5 fucking hours.

135
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,138
- I just need you to come...
- Wait. You're Dylan Dunn, right?

136
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:17,573
Yeah. Yeah, that's me. Yeah.

137
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:19,175
Yeah, you're Sara. I remember you.

138
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,678
Caylee's outside, and she's really sick.
She needs to see the doc right away.

139
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,480
Caylee's here? What's wrong with Caylee?

140
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,516
We gotta get her in a room.
We gotta get her to see the doc.

141
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:35,035
Hey. Caylee.

142
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,593
Why aren't you eating?

143
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:40,160
I... I just can't.

144
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:45,032
- Hey, listen, I'm gonna go get a drink.
- Yeah. I got her.

145
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,492
Caylee, you were doing so well.

146
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:52,949
Tell me, why aren't you really eating?

147
00:14:54,376 --> 00:14:56,009
I know.

148
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,782
I know you saw it.

149
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:02,038
You saw him, too.

150
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,525
What?

151
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,995
Hello! Can I get some help?

152
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:14,496
Caylee, are you okay?

153
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:16,763
What the hell is this shit?

154
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:18,901
Get her prepped, please.

155
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:23,130
- We're closed.
- Caylee. Caylee.

156
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,574
Here. I got her. I got her.
Come here. Come on.

157
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:28,482
Come on. Get up. Get up.

158
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:30,402
We got you.

159
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,568
What makes you think
you had a fear aftershock?

160
00:15:53,527 --> 00:15:55,771
I mean, but it was so...

161
00:15:56,236 --> 00:15:57,704
real.

162
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,743
Like the mask, the gun.

163
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:04,213
I could smell the gunpowder.

164
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:07,389
Okay, within days of being
in the chamber, Sara, sure,

165
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:10,019
but you haven't had a session in a year.

166
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,588
It's... it's unheard of.

167
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:17,226
There hasn't been one documented case
of fear aftershocks reemerging

168
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,261
since he built the chamber 20 years ago.

169
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:22,764
I don't understand why I can't
talk to Dr. Andover.

170
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:25,468
You know, what was
that thing that he was in?

171
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,637
Don't worry about that.

172
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,272
It's always been a secret part
of his process.

173
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:31,874
What do you mean?

174
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:34,909
Even though he can't see what you see,

175
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:37,479
it still takes a heavy
emotional toll on him.

176
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,815
Well, then why doesn't he just
go into the chamber himself?

177
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:44,053
Because it'd be counterproductive,
I mean, possibly even dangerous.

178
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,388
He's the only one
who knows how to run it.

179
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:50,423
He'd be the first to tell you, Sara,
he has no fear to treat.

180
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:55,164
I don't know what's going on here,
but our fears are coming back.

181
00:16:55,264 --> 00:17:00,002
And what is this black stuff
she projectile-vomited all over me?

182
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:04,206
At first, I thought it was
stomach bile, but it's thicker,

183
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:06,072
more viscous.

184
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:12,112
All I can tell you, Sara, is we've never
seen anything like it at the clinic.

185
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:20,360
Is there something
you're not telling me?

186
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,291
It's Paige.

187
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:26,860
Paige Peterson?

188
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:30,597
She's dead.

189
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,813
- What do you mean? She was better. I...
- She was better...

190
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:38,774
for a while.

191
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:42,777
She came back months later
insisting on talking to Andover.

192
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,873
Just like me now.

193
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:48,650
Did she die in the chamber?

194
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,700
I... Sara, I can't give you any more details,
Sara. I've already said too much.

195
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:57,326
And I'm afraid you're wasting
your time here.

196
00:17:58,026 --> 00:18:01,130
Look, I can't go backwards.

197
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,799
I put up with those hallucinations
in the chamber.

198
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:06,524
I slept with the lights on.
I did everything.

199
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:10,172
Caylee is clearly sick, okay?

200
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:11,871
I'm not leaving.

201
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,311
S...

202
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:16,155
Sara.

203
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,166
<i>Rewind. When did you know</i>

204
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:39,768
<i>that you could take the lead
and finish it out strong?</i>

205
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,072
<i>Uh, from the beginning.
I don't question it. I don't question it.</i>

206
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:45,708
<i>You just keep riding hard. You stay focused.
You keep doing it, you're gonna win,</i>

207
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:48,343
<i>you're gonna win, and that's
what I do. Done. Did it.</i>

208
00:18:49,043 --> 00:18:50,612
<i>Another trophy for your mantel...</i>

209
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,015
Try to relax, okay.

210
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,609
We're gonna get you something
for your pain, okay? Just relax.

211
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:09,098
Okay, I'm afraid Caylee is much sicker
than when we initially treated her.

212
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:11,433
Her sitophobia and body
dysmorphic disorder

213
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:13,878
have reached a point she could die
if she doesn't start eating.

214
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:16,005
I don't get it. She was cured
when we were here last year.

215
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:17,473
Why can't you treat her
with traditional means?

216
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,141
I'd have to run more tests to find out.

217
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,542
Why don't you just put her
in the damn chamber?

218
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,911
It's not an option, apparently.

219
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:25,499
Why? That's the reason why we came here.
Where the hell's the doctor?

220
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,121
He's supposed to be here.
Why won't he see her?

221
00:19:27,221 --> 00:19:29,752
I understand. Listen, between us,
I'm working on a backup plan

222
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:33,355
and hoping Andover will get onboard.
Caylee's life may depend on it.

223
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,024
He needs to get his head out of his ass.

224
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:38,327
Listen, I'm gonna stay and help
with Caylee. You don't have...

225
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,163
maybe a clean shirt and a few vacancies?

226
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,168
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

227
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:10,156
I have done as you asked...

228
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:15,063
you promised me. You promised me.

229
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:17,464
Give me what I want.

230
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,934
Please. I need it.

231
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:28,243
Paige Peterson, addendum.

232
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:31,544
This afternoon, I just...

233
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:43,223
You have time for a bubble bath,
but not to talk to me?

234
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,529
I'm sorry. I just...

235
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,702
I don't understand what's going on here.

236
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,804
You and me both.

237
00:20:55,904 --> 00:21:00,542
Things have been rather
trying around here lately.

238
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:03,176
I heard about Paige.

239
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:06,014
It was an accident.

240
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:08,481
- Right?
- No.

241
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:12,861
I was responsible for her, Sara.

242
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:16,191
I wanted to help her.
I wanted to help all of you.

243
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,026
You did help me.

244
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:20,861
You saved my life.

245
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:28,468
I saw the shooter.

246
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:31,638
The shooter?

247
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:38,547
No, that... that's never
happened before.

248
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:42,351
Prolonged aftershock, I know.
Osborn schooled me.

249
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:46,021
I think it's time for one more session.

250
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:49,558
Paige was just one more session.

251
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:52,394
Everything was just fine,

252
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:57,599
and then she somehow lost her way.
She lost me. I...

253
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:59,868
she was beyond my reach.

254
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:03,571
Sara, I nursed her for months.

255
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:08,914
She didn't require oxygen. She didn't need
life support. How's that possible?

256
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:11,747
I could tell.

257
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:15,837
I could see that she was
still suffering, that...

258
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:17,917
she was still terrified.

259
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,624
How did it end?

260
00:22:22,724 --> 00:22:26,726
I simply closed her eyes.

261
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,967
And she was gone.

262
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:38,206
I really appreciate
your wanting to help.

263
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:41,058
I really do, but...

264
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:46,071
I just can't do this anymore.

265
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:50,918
So if you'll excuse me,
I have some things I need to do.

266
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:58,527
Do you know that Caylee is throwing up
whatever black stuff that is in your vial?

267
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:01,828
You'd know that if you
came out of your office.

268
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:07,103
And unfortunately, Dr. Andover,
I'm not leaving.

269
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:10,648
The Fear Clinic is open for business.

270
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:17,679
Nobody can find out about this,
or we're in deep shit.

271
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:20,782
Dang! Fuck! I hate that fucking shit!

272
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:25,051
Well, that's Osborn's problem.
She can break it to the doc.

273
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,459
Son of a bitch.

274
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:32,995
You stole millions of dollars
worth of power

275
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:36,231
juicing up illegal grow farms.
You mean to tell me this is a challenge?

276
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,734
You know what?
Your fucking mama is a challenge.

277
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,319
Here's what I think. Why don't we just
get this son of a bitch back upstairs,

278
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,972
and I'll piggyback the breakout box?

279
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:46,875
Ah, fuck no. Look, for one,
Andover destroyed the...

280
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:51,613
whatever power supply was up there.
You need to figure something out, and fast.

281
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:54,249
How much you say she was
cutting us a check for?

282
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,652
So much we'll never
have to work here again

283
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:59,754
or do anything that winds us
back in the joint.

284
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:01,489
Well, that's a good thing.

285
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:04,326
<i> Ooh, sexy bitches <i>

286
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:07,129
<i> Are my favorite kind of bitches. <i>

287
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:10,999
You dumb-ass. I hate that song.

288
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:12,734
I daisy-chain a couple,
three gennies together,

289
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,803
I can have this thing
up and running by dinnertime.

290
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:16,870
- Boom.
- I'll be back.

291
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,106
Yes.

292
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,884
Hey. Baby, listen.

293
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:32,888
They're gonna keep you here
overnight for observation.

294
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,458
Well, they're gonna make you better.
They're gonna fix you.

295
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,727
They're gonna do it
without that Fear Chamber.

296
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,061
No.

297
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:44,997
You have to get me in there,
no matter what it takes.

298
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:49,138
- You want to lose me? Huh?
- Fuck no, I don't want to lose you.

299
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:53,979
God, I feel like I've already
lost too much of you. I...

300
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:56,364
All right.

301
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:58,419
All right, I'm gonna get you in there.

302
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:01,735
I'd do anything for you.

303
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:07,753
I like that.

304
00:27:46,314 --> 00:27:47,616
Paige?

305
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,117
Where are we?

306
00:27:51,786 --> 00:27:53,688
What happened to you?

307
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,257
In the chamber, what happened?

308
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:59,225
You thought you were building a box.

309
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:02,263
You built a door instead.

310
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:06,297
Door?
What door?

311
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:10,303
A door for me.

312
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:15,264
Every time you put someone
in that thing...

313
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:18,113
it made more cracks,

314
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:22,250
so I peeked through
the cracks you made...

315
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:26,252
became a little easier to turn.

316
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:32,425
I won't let you through again.

317
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,044
Paige Peterson,

318
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:00,209
female,

319
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:02,423
age 26,

320
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:04,926
deceased.

321
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:08,763
This black substance

322
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:12,249
seems to induce

323
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:15,836
hallucinations upon contact, which...

324
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:20,108
leads me to believe
that it's some kind of...

325
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,043
phobic residue,

326
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:23,878
a fear waste, if you will.

327
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:28,214
Why hasn't it manifested itself
before now?

328
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,255
Caylee.

329
00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:49,369
Caylee.

330
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:10,022
Caylee.

331
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:04,010
Show me.

332
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,319
Where?

333
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,560
I understand.

334
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,186
If that's what you want.

335
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:09,644
Ooh.

336
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:13,846
I am fucking hungry.
How are you feeling? You hungry?

337
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,319
You know my mom's doing
that whole dinner thing tonight, right?

338
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:19,954
Yeah. I gotta eat something
before then, though.

339
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:22,190
We could just go grab something
somewhere close.

340
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,391
- What's up, buddy?
- Hey, hey. What's up, dude?

341
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:27,495
- I just saw you on the video.
- Oh, yeah? How'd my hair look?

342
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:29,998
I don't know. You were
wearing a helmet, stupid.

343
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:31,230
Oh, you're so...

344
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:41,676
It was so cool, though.

345
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:43,878
And when are you going
to teach me those awesome flips?

346
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:48,750
No way. Your sister would fuck...
freaking kill me. Can't do that.

347
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,754
Hey, brat, you want
a milkshake over at Eli's?

348
00:32:52,854 --> 00:32:54,155
Are you kidding? It's freezing.

349
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:56,724
Hey, come on. Don't be a wuss.
It's warm in there.

350
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:57,759
Come on. What do you say?

351
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,627
- Uh...
- Milkshake?

352
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,562
- Fine.
- Fine.

353
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:02,030
- Done deal.
- Done deal.

354
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,420
- Ooh. Come on.
- Let's go.

355
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,632
Ah, shit, honey. Sorry about this.

356
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:44,272
Hate these damn things.
Always chewing up my wires.

357
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:48,007
Hey.

358
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:51,510
Know how you catch a unique squirrel?

359
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:56,785
Unique up on him.

360
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:41,928
<i>Osborn, please come to the
reception area for patient intake. Osborn.</i>

361
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:55,908
Mrs. Patton.

362
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:00,882
I'm Osborn, the head therapist here,
specializing in PTSD.

363
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:03,983
- So happy you could make it out.
- Of course.

364
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:09,854
Hi.

365
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,293
I'm Sara.

366
00:35:18,098 --> 00:35:21,436
He hasn't spoken since
the shooting, I'm afraid.

367
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,202
Blake.

368
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,591
Why don't we get you in an exam room
and get you all settled in, hmm?

369
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:44,757
Bauer.

370
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:52,596
Till then, you want to have a seat?

371
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:58,537
I have to admit,
this is not what I expected.

372
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:04,729
Wasn't always like this.

373
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,680
You've been here before?

374
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:11,862
I came here after the incident myself.

375
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,822
Dr. Andover really helped me.
He cured me of my scotophobia.

376
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,993
I'm sorry. It's fear of the dark.

377
00:36:23,063 --> 00:36:26,801
So why did you bring Blake here now?

378
00:36:27,922 --> 00:36:29,504
Well, at night...

379
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:32,007
just for a few minutes, not every night,

380
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,076
it's like he sees something

381
00:36:35,576 --> 00:36:37,478
and it really scares him.

382
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:41,819
He sees something relating
to the incident?

383
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:43,317
I don't know.

384
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:48,189
I know nothing can bring him back now,
not the way he was.

385
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:52,761
But I can't stand the thought of him
being terrorized by something

386
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:55,127
and then not knowing what it is.

387
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:59,708
I think he's in the right place.

388
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:25,698
<i>Do you know that that kid
can barely move,</i>

389
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:27,828
<i>but hurts himself every night,
he's so scared?</i>

390
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:30,998
Yes, I promise you
we are gonna help Blake.

391
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:34,769
How? By giving him fucking fluids

392
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:36,738
- and a lollipop like Caylee?
- Keep your voice down.

393
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,573
No! This is bullshit, and you know it.

394
00:37:39,673 --> 00:37:44,089
That kid is suffering. Caylee is on the brink
of death, and he's too chickenshit

395
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:46,078
- to use the chamber?
- Sara.

396
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:49,884
He said he'd never fail us, right?

397
00:37:49,984 --> 00:37:53,152
Well, he's failing us right fucking now.

398
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:39,632
Before you get angry...

399
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:44,770
this is your life's work.

400
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:51,042
I had it repaired for good reason,
and two of them are in the waiting room.

401
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:56,651
What you and this box have done
for me and my claustrophobia,

402
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,420
for all the people you've helped,

403
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,989
it is not over, and you know that.

404
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,965
In...

405
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:07,122
In over 20 years,
I've never had reason to doubt

406
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:09,872
that this was anything but a cure,

407
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:12,099
a magic bullet.

408
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:14,969
I thought I did everything right.

409
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:18,205
And you did. It was a terrible accident.

410
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:21,709
Paige was a tragedy, and it's...
it's not gonna happen again.

411
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:25,544
I don't want anyone else hurt.

412
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,117
We can save this boy,

413
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:32,520
another victim of that shooting,

414
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,525
one that was hurt so badly,
he flew under our radar all this time.

415
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:41,529
Can't we give his mother some peace
and let her know what's tormenting him?

416
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,320
I don't know if I can. I...

417
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:46,632
I don't know.

418
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,968
You can.

419
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,517
You can.

420
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:58,832
You can, and then you'll see

421
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:01,413
there's nothing to be afraid of.

422
00:40:04,218 --> 00:40:06,232
Don't worry, Doctor.

423
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:12,865
Have a little faith.

424
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:29,410
I don't understand.
Why are we taking the stairs?

425
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,376
Elevator's out.

426
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:37,318
And why is it in the basement?

427
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,863
Elevator's out.

428
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:50,231
All ready to leave you to it, Doctor.

429
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:53,409
No, please, you stay this time.
Given the, uh...

430
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:58,038
given the patient's condition,
this is new territory for both of us.

431
00:40:58,138 --> 00:40:59,371
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

432
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:01,275
Right this way.

433
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,145
The chamber is a very private experience
for our patients.

434
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:06,347
It's imperative
for Dr. Andover's concentration

435
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:08,282
that he has no distractions
during the session.

436
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,285
- Well, aren't you going to put him to sleep?
- We don't deal in dreams here.

437
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,052
At no time are our patients ever asleep.

438
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,818
Now...

439
00:41:31,118 --> 00:41:33,016
close your eyes,

440
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:38,260
and just listen to the sound
of my voice.

441
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:42,750
I need you to relax and listen

442
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:46,118
to the sound of my voice.

443
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:50,088
We're going back,

444
00:41:50,924 --> 00:41:52,960
back to the restaurant

445
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,663
on the day of the shooting.

446
00:41:56,063 --> 00:42:00,799
The restaurant is full
of people eating dinner.

447
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,471
Blake, what do you see?

448
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:09,308
Blake?

449
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:12,562
Are you there yet?

450
00:42:16,983 --> 00:42:20,588
- Blake, focus.
- Don't do this. Please don't...

451
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:22,690
Focus, Blake.

452
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,193
Blake, you're not focusing.

453
00:42:25,393 --> 00:42:28,028
His heart rate is elevated.
Do you want to stop, Doctor?

454
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,930
No. Blake.

455
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,766
Blake!

456
00:42:31,866 --> 00:42:33,198
What's happening?

457
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:37,484
- Bauer, would you come get her, please?
- Is he okay?

458
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:40,138
It's okay. Ma'am,
I need you to come with me.

459
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:47,045
Penlight.

460
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,124
It's okay, Blake. We're gonna
get you out of here in just a second.

461
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:57,591
Bauer, his chair.

462
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:06,798
We got you. We got you.

463
00:43:34,562 --> 00:43:38,832
<i>Hey, you've reached Megan.
Leave a message, and I might call you back.</i>

464
00:43:39,432 --> 00:43:43,504
Megan, will you please call me back, please?
I'm really starting to get worried.

465
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,904
- Fuck.
- Girlfriend trouble?

466
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:52,513
Listen, I need access to a car.

467
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:55,182
Well, I could probably do that.

468
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:57,518
But it'll cost you.

469
00:43:58,272 --> 00:43:59,520
Fuck off.

470
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,937
Is there a problem here?

471
00:44:03,523 --> 00:44:05,234
Oh, no, sir. We're just...
we're just kidding around.

472
00:44:05,334 --> 00:44:08,562
I can't find Megan. It's been, like,
6 hours. She's not answering her phone.

473
00:44:09,062 --> 00:44:10,731
Mr. Bauer,

474
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:12,693
you will go get the young lady.

475
00:44:14,134 --> 00:44:16,970
- Now.
- Yeah, okay, sir.

476
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,505
All right.

477
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:21,673
Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir. Sorry.

478
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:25,844
Thank you.

479
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,522
I don't fucking get you guys
with this chamber thing.

480
00:44:34,622 --> 00:44:35,923
You guys are all freaking obsessed.

481
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,290
You don't get it.

482
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:43,363
Everything fades once you're in there.

483
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:48,033
You don't have to be afraid
of anything anymore.

484
00:44:50,141 --> 00:44:51,872
It's bullshit.

485
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:53,774
What do you mean?

486
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:56,257
All right, fear
is a primal thing, right?

487
00:44:56,357 --> 00:44:59,747
Hey, babies were born with it.
It's part of our damn genetic code.

488
00:45:00,547 --> 00:45:04,218
We've evolved and we have survived
because of it.

489
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:07,921
I know all about fear,
and it's got no place in my world.

490
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:11,425
And now you've got some fucking guy who
builds this box, and he wants to play God,

491
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:15,193
and he wants to start digging around
in our heads and shit. No way.

492
00:45:16,363 --> 00:45:19,399
No. I'm pure instinct.
I don't need no fucking box.

493
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:21,769
Yeah, well, you're not getting in mine.

494
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:24,004
- You were a patient, right?
- No, I wasn't a patient here.

495
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:26,373
I was in that thing once.
I was only here one time.

496
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,225
It's just she used to show us videos
of all that crazy shit you did with bikes.

497
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:31,246
Oh, yeah? Well, what's he got
to say about his first ride?

498
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:34,615
Now, that wasn't very nice, now, was it?

499
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:38,018
Hey, don't be an asshole.

500
00:45:38,118 --> 00:45:41,853
Ah, yeah, we're gonna
go back and eat inside.

501
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,528
All it takes is one trigger-happy fuck,
and next thing you know,

502
00:45:47,628 --> 00:45:50,829
you got nobody to push the buttons
on the control panel.

503
00:46:07,747 --> 00:46:10,118
Have a little respect.

504
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:11,886
Just a little.

505
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:15,853
Guess he wasn't as lucky
as the rest of us that night.

506
00:46:48,398 --> 00:46:50,558
Help. Hello. Somebody, hello.

507
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:53,024
<i>Megan, your old room's waiting for you.</i>

508
00:46:57,908 --> 00:47:00,467
- There you go.
- Super!

509
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:05,971
I missed you, Megan. You're like a ray
of fucking sunshine in my day.

510
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:14,748
As usual, you guys corner
the market on hospitality.

511
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:21,553
Hospitality. I'll fucking show you
hospi-fucking-tality.

512
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:28,829
- <i> Sexy bitches... <i>
- <i> It's way past midnight <i>

513
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,496
<i> There's a howling wind,
oh, God what can it... <i>

514
00:47:36,803 --> 00:47:38,138
Oh, thank God.

515
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:39,633
Ow.

516
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:42,976
I was so worried about you.
Are you okay?

517
00:47:43,076 --> 00:47:45,912
Yeah. I don't know. I...

518
00:47:46,012 --> 00:47:48,713
I just thought it would
pass on its own, I guess.

519
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,786
I've got so much to tell you.

520
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,530
Hey, babe.

521
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,633
I'm gonna take a shower.
I'll see you after your session, 'kay?

522
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:08,302
Come here.

523
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:12,139
- Come here.
- What's up? You okay?

524
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:15,243
- No.
- No? What's wrong?

525
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,212
Come on.

526
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,848
Now just focus

527
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,866
on the sound of my voice.

528
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:44,968
Now...

529
00:48:45,668 --> 00:48:47,783
you're going back.

530
00:48:48,408 --> 00:48:50,408
You're going to return...

531
00:48:51,378 --> 00:48:53,144
to the restaurant.

532
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:58,385
Are you there?

533
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,988
Are you in the restaurant?

534
00:49:01,388 --> 00:49:04,623
You see your boyfriend. You see Dylan.

535
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,163
I'm safe.

536
00:49:09,463 --> 00:49:11,465
I see them.

537
00:49:12,165 --> 00:49:13,734
Caylee,

538
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:18,271
I need you to tell me exactly
where you are.

539
00:49:23,844 --> 00:49:25,612
I'm safe.

540
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:26,678
Good.

541
00:49:28,182 --> 00:49:33,406
So now it's just a few moments
before the incident.

542
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:38,756
Do you see anyone approaching the door?

543
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:41,405
I can see him.

544
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:45,132
Can you see your brother?

545
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,567
Do you see little Kevin
sitting opposite you?

546
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:54,947
I can see him.

547
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:56,744
What's he wearing?

548
00:50:00,947 --> 00:50:03,083
Picture it, Caylee.

549
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:06,086
What are you eating? Picture everything.

550
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:10,358
I don't want to remember everything.
I can't. That's not what I'm supposed to do.

551
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:15,109
Yes, that's precisely what you're
supposed to do. Now trust me.

552
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:21,368
Now look to your brother.

553
00:50:22,673 --> 00:50:23,735
No!

554
00:50:25,872 --> 00:50:28,041
- I can't.
- Caylee, look at Kevin.

555
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:29,407
Get me out of here!

556
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:33,580
I want you to picture everything.

557
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:41,421
Get me out of here! Get me out of here!

558
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,792
Caylee. Caylee,

559
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:50,380
I know it's painful for you to relive
that day, but you can't hide from it.

560
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,599
I'll have Gage help you
to your room, Caylee. Just relax.

561
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:56,770
What the fuck was that?
That wasn't supposed to happen.

562
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:59,138
He promised me!

563
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:02,443
- Come on. Come on, hon. Let me help you out.
- You fuck. Get off of me! Get off!

564
00:51:02,543 --> 00:51:04,344
- Okay.
- I'm not a fucking cripple!

565
00:51:04,444 --> 00:51:05,779
- I'm not the one in the wheelchair.
- Okay. Okay.

566
00:51:05,879 --> 00:51:07,735
Move! Move!

567
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,936
That wasn't about food at all, was it?

568
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,726
No. No, it certainly was not.

569
00:51:29,703 --> 00:51:31,038
Hey.

570
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:33,446
You mind if I come in?

571
00:51:44,717 --> 00:51:46,484
It's okay.

572
00:51:57,297 --> 00:51:58,729
You want to know a secret?

573
00:52:01,468 --> 00:52:03,735
I was always afraid of the dark...

574
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:07,908
ever since I was a little kid

575
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:10,177
in my bedroom.

576
00:52:11,415 --> 00:52:13,647
And then when the shooting happened...

577
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,317
the guy followed me,

578
00:52:18,317 --> 00:52:21,055
you know, like me and only me

579
00:52:21,455 --> 00:52:23,922
when he started shooting out the lights.

580
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:29,830
And, you know, at that moment,

581
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,559
I wasn't even scared of him.

582
00:52:37,704 --> 00:52:39,737
I was scared of the dark.

583
00:52:41,108 --> 00:52:44,709
I was scared of monsters in the dark.

584
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:48,146
Anyway...

585
00:52:50,484 --> 00:52:53,156
Dr. Andover really helped me.

586
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,690
Until lately.

587
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:01,681
I'm starting to think maybe it's smart
to be scared of the dark.

588
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:18,676
S'okay.

589
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,055
S'okay, be...

590
00:53:26,653 --> 00:53:28,719
S'okay.

591
00:53:31,058 --> 00:53:32,525
I se...

592
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:35,993
I see monsters...

593
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:39,566
too. I see mons...

594
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,702
Blake.

595
00:53:46,038 --> 00:53:48,539
Sara, Dr. Andover
would like to speak to you.

596
00:53:56,082 --> 00:53:58,950
Hey. I'll be right back.

597
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,927
Blake?

598
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:13,476
Blake, are you okay?

599
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:17,502
What's wrong, Blake?

600
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,517
Fuck!

601
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,613
Take it easy.

602
00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:23,770
Yeah.

603
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:29,075
Hard. Hard. Hard.

604
00:55:30,248 --> 00:55:33,909
Hurt me. Fucking hurt me. Fuck!

605
00:55:34,213 --> 00:55:35,982
Harder. Oh, harder.

606
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,021
- Hard...
- Caylee, what the fuck... fuck is...

607
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:42,022
fuck is wrong with you?
Fuck, can't we just be normal for once?

608
00:55:42,122 --> 00:55:45,025
Get out. Get out!

609
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:47,260
You're fucking useless.

610
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,428
- This is fucking bullshit.
- Get out.

611
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,649
He's moving again. He's talking.

612
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:12,483
- I know.
- Blake moved.

613
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:20,124
- His brain activity has tripled.
- Why can't you see that that's amazing?

614
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:27,435
Because, Sara, what's happening here
to Blake simply isn't possible.

615
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:31,438
The chamber wasn't designed
to work that way.

616
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:36,042
The chamber doesn't cure gunshot wounds.
It simply opens a door

617
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:39,779
into a portion of the brain that most people
keep locked away. That's it.

618
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:43,183
Then why did you tell his mother that
you thought he was going to be helped?

619
00:56:43,283 --> 00:56:47,131
Yes, I thought perhaps we could
improve his... his function a fraction

620
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:50,890
using sensory techniques.
But this? Oh, no.

621
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:55,495
- This is impossible. This is dangerous.
- Or it's a miracle.

622
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:59,399
Or and if it's not a miracle,
it's a really fucking great side effect.

623
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,870
I honestly don't understand why
you're not calling medical journals

624
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,838
and telling them that it works again.

625
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:07,507
Because I invented the goddamn thing.

626
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:10,402
I know what it's capable of.

627
00:57:11,577 --> 00:57:14,045
Look, maybe this will make sense.

628
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:37,091
Blakey? Blakey?

629
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:39,572
Blakey! Baby, are you okay?

630
00:57:40,307 --> 00:57:42,809
Oh, baby. What? What?

631
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:46,179
What do you see? What?
What, honey? What's the matter?

632
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:48,114
You're okay. You're okay.
You're with Mommy.

633
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:51,086
Mommy's here. Mommy's here.

634
00:57:51,186 --> 00:57:52,751
Mommy's here.

635
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,557
This is the amygdala.

636
00:57:57,657 --> 00:58:02,462
It's the part of the brain where the emotion
of fear is generated from.

637
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,685
And until today... until today,

638
00:58:05,785 --> 00:58:10,203
Blake's entire frontal lobe
was severely damaged by that bullet...

639
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,706
utterly, totally unresponsive.

640
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:16,910
I think this is about the chamber.

641
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:18,912
I think it's doing something
to all of you.

642
00:58:19,012 --> 00:58:21,548
I think it's doing it for a reason.

643
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:26,152
Sara. Sara, don't look at me like that.

644
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,894
Listen, I know this sounds crazy,

645
00:58:27,994 --> 00:58:31,453
especially coming
from a man of science, but...

646
00:58:32,525 --> 00:58:35,695
I'm truly afraid that there could be

647
00:58:35,795 --> 00:58:39,864
a malevolent entity at work here.

648
00:58:41,534 --> 00:58:43,937
You can't quit.

649
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,398
It's not an option.

650
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:57,315
Besides, what reason would a malevolent
force have for making Blake smarter?

651
00:59:09,529 --> 00:59:11,731
<i>...what reason
would a malevolent force have</i>

652
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:14,246
<i>for making Blake smarter?</i>

653
00:59:19,606 --> 00:59:23,774
So that he can be made
to feel fear again.

654
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,889
How bad is it?

655
01:00:13,926 --> 01:00:15,476
It's not that bad.

656
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,578
I need you to take a deep breath.
All right, Megan?

657
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:23,002
- I'm going to have to cut this. Okay?
- Okay.

658
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,342
Okay, just take a deep breath, okay?

659
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:31,103
Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

660
01:00:32,678 --> 01:00:35,982
You're gonna feel some pressure now.
All right? I have to squeeze it.

661
01:00:36,082 --> 01:00:39,608
- Oh, God. Ow. It hurts.
- I know, sweetie. Just take a deep breath.

662
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:42,422
Please stay still, Megan, okay?
Calm down, sweetie.

663
01:00:50,496 --> 01:00:52,032
- It itches. It...
- I know, sweetie.

664
01:00:52,132 --> 01:00:54,868
- It's like there's something inside.
- I know. Just breathe. Just breathe.

665
01:00:54,968 --> 01:00:58,571
Stay still so I can clean this, okay?
Okay, sweetie.

666
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:02,182
- Oh, Christ. It hurts. It...
- Take a deep breath.

667
01:01:04,143 --> 01:01:07,313
It feels like there's something
crawling in there.

668
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,747
Is there something in there?

669
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:17,557
Oh, what the hell is that?

670
01:01:17,657 --> 01:01:19,742
What is that?

671
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:54,927
Hey.

672
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:56,729
You mind if I come in?

673
01:01:58,297 --> 01:01:59,163
Sure.

674
01:02:05,872 --> 01:02:07,805
I didn't know you had tattoos.

675
01:02:11,543 --> 01:02:15,379
- Did that hurt?
- I don't know.

676
01:02:22,722 --> 01:02:25,725
Do you remember anything?

677
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,293
What do you remember...

678
01:02:27,993 --> 01:02:30,188
about that night, Blake?

679
01:02:34,267 --> 01:02:36,066
Sara.

680
01:02:38,136 --> 01:02:40,440
I get flashes

681
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,742
in the chamber.

682
01:02:42,642 --> 01:02:47,164
It's... it's not like you guys.
I don't...

683
01:02:55,821 --> 01:02:57,688
When does your mom come to get you?

684
01:03:06,132 --> 01:03:07,898
I don't know.

685
01:03:09,302 --> 01:03:10,770
I don't care.

686
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,539
She seems a little overprotective.

687
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:14,772
Yeah.

688
01:03:17,363 --> 01:03:19,478
That's one way to put it.

689
01:03:19,878 --> 01:03:24,081
- She cares, though.
- Can we please just not talk about her?

690
01:03:29,856 --> 01:03:32,371
S... I'm sorry.

691
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,662
You know what would have
been really nice?

692
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:40,895
Just if we could have
known each other before

693
01:03:41,195 --> 01:03:44,835
any of this shit happened.

694
01:03:49,442 --> 01:03:51,876
I would have liked that.

695
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,694
Corner lamp,

696
01:04:07,794 --> 01:04:11,686
patient room 2A.

697
01:04:16,535 --> 01:04:18,371
- Ah!
- Fuck!

698
01:04:18,471 --> 01:04:20,602
- It's me, fuck-nut.
- Jesus Christ, Bauer.

699
01:04:20,702 --> 01:04:23,409
What are you doing?
Where'd you get that creepy-ass thing?

700
01:04:23,509 --> 01:04:25,411
It's cool, right?
I found it in the basement.

701
01:04:25,511 --> 01:04:27,847
No, it's goddamn weird.
Gives me the heebie-jeebies.

702
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,083
All right, all right.
Put your fucking vagina away.

703
01:04:30,183 --> 01:04:33,452
Fuck you! You scared
the shit out of me, boy!

704
01:04:33,552 --> 01:04:36,408
Goddamn jokester motherfucker.

705
01:04:39,025 --> 01:04:40,726
Aw, horseshit.

706
01:04:40,826 --> 01:04:44,697
- Don't know how to do your job, old man?
- I do my job the same way I do your mama,

707
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,565
8 hours a day.

708
01:04:46,965 --> 01:04:50,068
Might have to switch me up
some circuits in here.

709
01:04:50,168 --> 01:04:52,238
Goddamn it.

710
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:55,708
Ah, we're gonna need to be ready
for emergency lighting anyway.

711
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,976
That storm's coming up strong.

712
01:04:58,076 --> 01:04:59,810
What the fuck?

713
01:05:04,282 --> 01:05:06,085
I'm glad you and...

714
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:08,619
you and Sara are getting along.

715
01:05:09,689 --> 01:05:13,156
So, uh... how are you feeling?

716
01:05:15,094 --> 01:05:16,929
Good. Thank you.

717
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:19,466
Now, Blake,

718
01:05:19,566 --> 01:05:24,670
during your session in the chamber,
did you see anything strange?

719
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:28,007
Hear a voice other than mine

720
01:05:28,107 --> 01:05:30,463
trying to speak to you? Hmm?

721
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:36,080
May I?

722
01:05:39,751 --> 01:05:41,652
Ah. Oh.

723
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:46,056
The mask from the diner.
Is that what you saw?

724
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:54,993
I understand how traumatic that
could be for you to remember, Blake.

725
01:05:55,093 --> 01:05:56,901
It's scary.

726
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,539
Blake.

727
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:03,908
It's... it's a scary mask.

728
01:06:05,677 --> 01:06:08,681
Blake... it's just a mask.

729
01:06:09,081 --> 01:06:12,551
All of us wear masks every day.

730
01:06:13,351 --> 01:06:15,988
We hide behind social masks.

731
01:06:16,088 --> 01:06:19,025
We need to wear them.
We couldn't survive without them.

732
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:23,930
What frightens you isn't this mask.

733
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:27,206
What scares you is what it represents.

734
01:06:38,644 --> 01:06:44,373
Blake, I need to ask you something
that may make you feel uncomfortable,

735
01:06:44,883 --> 01:06:46,116
might upset you.

736
01:06:49,822 --> 01:06:51,688
Go ahead.

737
01:06:53,993 --> 01:06:57,389
I need to know exactly

738
01:06:57,489 --> 01:07:00,431
where you were sitting in that diner.

739
01:07:02,734 --> 01:07:03,755
I don't know.

740
01:07:05,637 --> 01:07:09,108
All right. What were you wearing, hmm?

741
01:07:09,908 --> 01:07:11,041
You remember that?

742
01:07:13,979 --> 01:07:16,482
- Talk to me. What did you have to eat?
- I don't know.

743
01:07:16,582 --> 01:07:20,134
French fries? How did you get there, Blake?
Who did you come with?

744
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:23,389
All right. What was your meal that day?
What were you wearing?

745
01:07:23,489 --> 01:07:25,691
- I don't know.
- Blake, you can do this.

746
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:29,229
- Talk to me, Blake!
- You look at me,

747
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:33,199
and you don't know anything.

748
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:36,166
Doc. You gotta come with me.

749
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:41,438
- Were you even there that day?
- Doc.

750
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:47,747
The basement. It's the bug chick.

751
01:07:47,847 --> 01:07:50,014
It appears Blake's
developed necrophobia.

752
01:07:56,055 --> 01:07:58,391
I think it's a good idea for me
to go prep her room,

753
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:01,409
prepare for a worst-case scenario.

754
01:08:01,509 --> 01:08:04,897
I'm not even sure I know what
a worst-case scenario is around here.

755
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,099
I know, but I don't know
what else to do.

756
01:08:07,399 --> 01:08:10,402
She will claw herself apart.

757
01:08:10,502 --> 01:08:14,807
At least in here,
we have a chance to reach her.

758
01:08:14,907 --> 01:08:16,073
You can reach her.

759
01:08:24,283 --> 01:08:26,850
Or something else may reach her.

760
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:40,111
Sweetheart, I'm gonna need you
to close your eyes.

761
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:44,768
Megan. Megan.

762
01:08:45,738 --> 01:08:47,104
Megan.

763
01:08:48,341 --> 01:08:49,338
Megan.

764
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,443
No!

765
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:08,207
<i>A masked gunman has opened fire
inside a popular restaurant tonight,</i>

766
01:12:08,307 --> 01:12:11,243
<i>killing 6 people,
including a 7-year-old boy.</i>

767
01:12:11,543 --> 01:12:14,713
<i>Police are still looking for the suspect,
who is said to be wearing a mask</i>

768
01:12:14,813 --> 01:12:16,980
<i>and is heavily armed.</i>

769
01:12:39,638 --> 01:12:41,640
Get the hell on,
you annoying son of a bitch.

770
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,675
Hey, you know
what's going on with the lights?

771
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:46,078
Obviously, there is a power surge.

772
01:12:46,178 --> 01:12:49,022
Dr. O thinks my time is better off
spent putting beds together

773
01:12:49,222 --> 01:12:50,836
for goddamn crazy people.

774
01:12:50,936 --> 01:12:53,919
By the way, your friend's down
in the chamber. She freaked out.

775
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:57,256
- Who? Megan?
- That's the one.

776
01:12:57,956 --> 01:13:00,058
Can you take me to her, please?

777
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:02,561
You know what? I am goddamn tired
of being a chambermaid.

778
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:06,231
I need to reroute power to the emergency
lights anyway. Come on. I'll take you there.

779
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:08,167
Shit.

780
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:12,533
Megan. Megan.
Megan, talk to me. Open it!

781
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:14,155
- I'll see what I can do.
- Can't you open it?

782
01:13:14,255 --> 01:13:20,244
Megan. Hey. Hey, Megan. Talk to me.
Look at me. Look at me. Hey.

783
01:13:29,088 --> 01:13:31,721
Bauer, get your ass down
to the chamber now!

784
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,249
Let's get her out of there.

785
01:13:37,929 --> 01:13:41,200
Get her head down there.
What the hell is wrong with her?

786
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,162
Listen, I can't find Andover anywhere.
He is fucking gone.

787
01:13:44,262 --> 01:13:47,172
- Oh, Jesus.
- What's wrong with her eyes?

788
01:13:48,172 --> 01:13:51,276
- God, she doesn't even blink. That's trippy.
- Don't touch her.

789
01:13:51,576 --> 01:13:54,346
I saw the same thing with Paige.
Her heart rate and blood pressure

790
01:13:54,446 --> 01:13:58,150
are impossibly low.
By all accounts, she should be dead.

791
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,252
Sweetie, come on. It's okay.

792
01:14:00,652 --> 01:14:02,921
Don't close her eyes,

793
01:14:03,821 --> 01:14:04,990
even for a minute.

794
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:08,861
You guys, she needs real medical attention,
more than I can give her here.

795
01:14:08,961 --> 01:14:12,531
Under normal circumstances, I can cover
RN duties, but nothing is normal here.

796
01:14:13,431 --> 01:14:16,134
We need to get her to a hospital
before her body goes into shock.

797
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:19,704
- I can carry her out.
- No. Someone's got to go to the hospital.

798
01:14:19,804 --> 01:14:21,473
That ain't gonna happen, all right?

799
01:14:21,573 --> 01:14:25,511
All the doors and windows are jammed tight
with this tar shit. It's impossible.

800
01:14:25,611 --> 01:14:28,046
Yeah? Well, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

801
01:14:28,146 --> 01:14:31,817
- I still don't have a damn signal.
- I ain't got one either upstairs.

802
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:35,087
Whether it's that storm or this shit,
I don't know, but here's what I'm thinking.

803
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:37,956
- We're fucked.
- Okay, I need more medical supplies.

804
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:40,846
When this sedative wears off,
if she even comes out of this,

805
01:14:40,946 --> 01:14:43,028
we need extra blankets
to raise her body temperature,

806
01:14:43,128 --> 01:14:46,131
- and there's not enough down here.
- I'm gonna go get supplies, all right?

807
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:47,599
- No. No, no, no.
- I'll be back in a minute.

808
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:51,236
Honey, wait a minute. None of us know what
the hell's going on around here, all right?

809
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:53,205
Everything's gone up shit creek.
I don't think you should be

810
01:14:53,305 --> 01:14:56,473
- running around there all by yourself.
- I'll take my chances.

811
01:15:00,312 --> 01:15:03,180
Goddamn, that is creepy.

812
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:31,644
Paige.

813
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:35,111
Please, help me.

814
01:15:52,764 --> 01:15:54,886
I know who you are.

815
01:16:00,304 --> 01:16:01,698
I won't let you through again.

816
01:16:04,509 --> 01:16:06,898
The door is closed.

817
01:16:08,514 --> 01:16:12,583
You were taking
so much food off my table.

818
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:48,251
I'm going back.

819
01:16:49,955 --> 01:16:52,423
You're home now.

820
01:17:06,571 --> 01:17:08,687
<i>Her body
temperature and vitals say she...</i>

821
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:12,578
<i>she should have expired,
but she's beyond my reach.</i>

822
01:17:12,678 --> 01:17:16,482
<i>It's as if something else is holding on
to her, not letting her die,</i>

823
01:17:16,582 --> 01:17:21,286
<i>keeping her in a state worse than death,
a kind of fear loop.</i>

824
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:27,216
<i>I stupidly
tried to eradicate a fundamental</i>

825
01:17:27,316 --> 01:17:31,463
<i>and necessary human function,
the oldest human emotion.</i>

826
01:17:31,963 --> 01:17:34,032
<i>And now fear itself,</i>

827
01:17:34,132 --> 01:17:38,268
<i>now it wants to live
and breathe on its own.</i>

828
01:17:39,971 --> 01:17:44,476
<i>I think... I think an entity
is coming through into our world,</i>

829
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:49,614
<i>and now fear itself,
perhaps planning to use all of us</i>

830
01:17:49,714 --> 01:17:52,315
<i>as a host, a vessel.</i>

831
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:04,262
'Bout time you get down here.
Can you give me a hand?

832
01:18:04,662 --> 01:18:06,635
Lazy fucker.

833
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:14,273
Come on. Quit looking for your girlie
magazines and get over here. Help me out.

834
01:18:14,973 --> 01:18:17,486
Thing ain't gonna jury-rig itself.

835
01:18:18,676 --> 01:18:19,542
Fuck.

836
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,948
What the fuck is this?

837
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,859
What in the fuck?

838
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:56,782
Look, I know the sounds of gunshots.
We need to get the hell out of here.

839
01:18:57,182 --> 01:18:58,915
And how are you gonna do that?

840
01:19:00,052 --> 01:19:01,805
I'm gonna find a way.

841
01:19:06,024 --> 01:19:08,511
Fuck! Fuck!

842
01:19:33,084 --> 01:19:36,188
What's going on? Did you find him?

843
01:19:36,888 --> 01:19:39,191
Bauer, can you please
go find Andover for me?

844
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:41,159
- Yeah. I mean, it wants me.
- Please?

845
01:19:41,259 --> 01:19:42,794
It needs me to... it wants me to join.

846
01:19:42,894 --> 01:19:44,162
- Bauer.
- I'm not in.

847
01:19:44,262 --> 01:19:46,632
- Bauer.
- I don't want...

848
01:19:46,732 --> 01:19:49,100
- Bauer.
- I don't want to be in.

849
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:52,070
- What is going on with you? Bauer?
- This is the door.

850
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:53,737
Bauer? Bauer!

851
01:19:57,175 --> 01:20:01,547
You really think he's gonna
let me leave here, don't you?

852
01:20:02,247 --> 01:20:04,048
"He"? Who the hell
are you talking about, babe?

853
01:20:04,148 --> 01:20:05,684
He's coming.

854
01:20:05,784 --> 01:20:10,555
Bauer, can you please
go get Dr. Andover for me?

855
01:20:11,355 --> 01:20:13,558
What... what is going on with you?

856
01:20:13,658 --> 01:20:15,360
Bauer!

857
01:20:17,295 --> 01:20:18,797
Bauer?

858
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:22,134
- You still don't get it, do you?
- Oh, no, no, no. You don't...

859
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:24,035
- He's coming.
- No, no.

860
01:20:24,135 --> 01:20:26,536
- That's how you leave!
- Bauer?

861
01:20:28,039 --> 01:20:30,776
- Hear him, baby?
- No, listen to me. You're talking crazy.

862
01:20:30,876 --> 01:20:33,511
The window. I pushed on the...
It pushed back!

863
01:20:33,611 --> 01:20:35,513
- Look at me.
- It's not letting me leave.

864
01:20:35,613 --> 01:20:38,917
- No! No! No! No!
- Bauer, it's okay. It's okay.

865
01:20:39,017 --> 01:20:42,986
- It'll all be over soon.
- No, I got an idea. I have this.

866
01:20:46,157 --> 01:20:47,192
Caylee!

867
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:50,960
Bauer!

868
01:21:00,806 --> 01:21:05,277
You promised me.
You promised me I could be with him.

869
01:21:05,377 --> 01:21:09,679
You promised me you'd get me
out of here. Go away!

870
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,585
I keep my promises.

871
01:21:13,685 --> 01:21:15,618
You want to see Kevin?

872
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,726
<i>Worse than death, a kind of fear loop.</i>

873
01:21:48,887 --> 01:21:51,623
<i>My hundreds
of sessions curing the phobic</i>

874
01:21:51,723 --> 01:21:54,392
<i>are starving this thing somehow.</i>

875
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:57,595
<i>It's relentless and,
worst of all, patient.</i>

876
01:21:57,695 --> 01:22:02,231
<i>It needs to feed,
and it won't be denied its meals.</i>

877
01:22:17,782 --> 01:22:19,648
Dr. Andover?

878
01:22:20,919 --> 01:22:23,452
Have a little faith.

879
01:22:25,257 --> 01:22:27,893
Is that... is that you?

880
01:22:28,293 --> 01:22:31,230
Have a little faith.

881
01:22:32,664 --> 01:22:34,666
Are you okay?

882
01:22:35,567 --> 01:22:40,169
Everything's going to be okay.

883
01:22:51,115 --> 01:22:52,884
Worse than death,

884
01:22:53,684 --> 01:22:57,320
the kind of fear loop.

885
01:23:39,297 --> 01:23:41,230
Andover?

886
01:23:47,572 --> 01:23:49,405
Andover!

887
01:24:06,024 --> 01:24:07,290
Please.

888
01:24:15,533 --> 01:24:16,969
No! God!

889
01:25:04,983 --> 01:25:06,785
Sara,

890
01:25:07,485 --> 01:25:09,454
you were right about one thing.

891
01:25:09,554 --> 01:25:14,023
Sometimes it's smart
to be scared of the dark.

892
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:16,726
No!

893
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:28,540
Blake.

894
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:33,111
Blake, it's not you.
Blake, this isn't you.

895
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:37,348
Then tell me, Sara,
why does this mask feel so familiar?

896
01:25:37,648 --> 01:25:40,085
You're not wearing a mask.

897
01:25:40,185 --> 01:25:41,686
Look.

898
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:43,953
Feel your face.

899
01:25:58,836 --> 01:26:00,906
You killed all those people!

900
01:26:01,006 --> 01:26:02,693
You should be dead!

901
01:26:08,846 --> 01:26:10,872
I do remember you.

902
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:23,995
It was me.

903
01:26:24,563 --> 01:26:26,231
It was me.

904
01:26:26,331 --> 01:26:29,265
I did it. I'm so sorry.

905
01:26:40,478 --> 01:26:41,777
Blake, we have to go.

906
01:27:01,599 --> 01:27:03,165
Don't. No.

907
01:27:08,773 --> 01:27:10,041
How did it end?

908
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:13,943
I simply closed her eyes.

909
01:27:33,264 --> 01:27:34,597
Fuck!

910
01:28:07,332 --> 01:28:08,631
Dylan.

911
01:28:13,938 --> 01:28:16,272
You want to see Kevin?

912
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:58,014
Stop! Get off me!

913
01:29:01,151 --> 01:29:02,852
There's nothing left to fear.

914
01:29:52,403 --> 01:29:54,472
It's just us.

915
01:29:54,572 --> 01:29:56,457
I know.

916
01:29:57,608 --> 01:30:00,278
But it'll be back,

917
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:03,147
and it'll be stronger.

918
01:30:03,347 --> 01:30:05,914
Fear never dies.

919
01:30:08,553 --> 01:30:11,289
It wanted you all along.

920
01:30:11,389 --> 01:30:12,888
Was my fault.

921
01:30:14,859 --> 01:30:17,693
I opened the door.

922
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:25,868
Then let's change the locks.

923
01:30:28,072 --> 01:30:30,973
Maybe it's time
for one more session, Doctor.

924
01:30:32,577 --> 01:30:37,148
<i>Fear, it is relentless.</i>

925
01:30:37,248 --> 01:30:39,017
<i>It needs to feed,</i>

926
01:30:39,117 --> 01:30:42,420
<i>and it won't be denied its meals.</i>

927
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,524
<i>After seeing what it did to get to me,</i>

928
01:30:46,624 --> 01:30:50,528
<i>my concern is that fear itself</i>

929
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:54,532
<i>will use me, my clinic,</i>

930
01:30:54,632 --> 01:30:57,467
<i>and the chamber to feed, to...</i>

931
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:00,002
<i>to consume...</i>

932
01:31:01,705 --> 01:31:03,639
<i>all of us.</i>

933
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:08,217
Now close your eyes.

934
01:31:08,317 --> 01:31:12,493
Concentrate on the sound of my voice.

935
01:32:09,373 --> 01:32:11,876
<i> It's way past midnight
There's a howling wind <i>

936
01:32:11,976 --> 01:32:14,345
<i> Oh, God, what can it be? <i>

937
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:18,783
<i> Something out there evil
Is coming straight for me <i>

938
01:32:18,883 --> 01:32:23,287
<i> The house is dark and very cold
I know there's no one here <i>

939
01:32:23,387 --> 01:32:27,592
<i> Why am I scared to death?
Just petrified with fear <i>

940
01:32:27,692 --> 01:32:30,128
<i> 'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking <i>

941
01:32:30,228 --> 01:32:32,130
<i> Waiting for me in the house <i>

942
01:32:32,230 --> 01:32:34,666
<i> 'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking <i>

943
01:32:34,766 --> 01:32:38,877
<i> Waiting for me in the dark
The dark <i>

944
01:32:54,885 --> 01:32:57,188
<i> When I opened up the door
and snapped on the switch <i>

945
01:32:57,288 --> 01:32:59,424
<i> The room was filled with light <i>

946
01:32:59,524 --> 01:33:03,861
<i> Then something black and very fast
Flit upon my sight <i>

947
01:33:03,961 --> 01:33:08,666
<i> What I feared most as a child
Was the coming of the night <i>

948
01:33:08,766 --> 01:33:12,937
<i> Now my horrors have become quite real
My nightmares breathe new life <i>

949
01:33:13,037 --> 01:33:15,406
<i> 'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking <i>

950
01:33:15,506 --> 01:33:17,442
<i> Waiting for me in the house <i>

951
01:33:17,542 --> 01:33:19,877
<i> 'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking <i>

952
01:33:19,977 --> 01:33:22,544
<i> Waiting for me in the dark <i>

953
01:33:23,648 --> 01:33:25,382
<i> Dark <i>

954
01:33:31,923 --> 01:33:33,355
<i> Yeah <i>

955
01:34:24,542 --> 01:34:28,813
<i> What is it in the house
That the darkness brings to life? <i>

956
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:33,518
<i> I sense their eyes upon me
As I grab a butcher knife <i>

957
01:34:33,618 --> 01:34:37,955
<i> Whatever it is that waits for me
It hides beneath my bed <i>

958
01:34:38,055 --> 01:34:42,393
<i> And if I try to sleep tonight
By morning, I'll be dead <i>

959
01:34:42,493 --> 01:34:44,862
<i> 'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking <i>

960
01:34:44,962 --> 01:34:46,831
<i> Waiting for me in the house <i>

961
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,267
<i> 'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking <i>

962
01:34:49,367 --> 01:34:51,402
<i> Waiting for me in the dark <i>

963
01:34:51,502 --> 01:34:53,871
<i> 'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking <i>

964
01:34:53,971 --> 01:34:55,973
<i> Waiting for me in the house <i>

965
01:34:56,073 --> 01:34:58,442
<i> 'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking
Of something evil lurking <i>

966
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:01,944
<i> Waiting for me in the dark <i>

967
01:35:03,481 --> 01:35:05,616
<i> Yeah </i>

968
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:15,292
<i> Yeah, 'cause I'm shaking,
and I'm thinking </i>

969
01:35:15,392 --> 01:35:18,496
<i> Of something evil lurking
Waiting for me in the house <i>

970
01:35:18,596 --> 01:35:21,032
<i> 'Cause I'm shaking, and I'm thinking

971
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,201
<i> Waiting for me in the dark <i>

972
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:25,567
Fear never dies.
