1
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,391
- Great!
- A and E.

2
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,873
So is the country like that?

3
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,275
Yes, boy you're city.

4
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,844
- Look darling, Shore Street 17.
- I saw.

5
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,045
- Are you all right, Davey?
- I'm fine.

6
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,819
God!

7
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,392
In that house we stand?

8
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,628
No, Davey.

9
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,394
It can not be that.

10
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:53,377
Dracula subtitles.

11
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,999
What ruin!

12
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,300
Exactly as described in the ad:
"Suitable for a large family."

13
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,640
It's huge A.

14
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,875
Marian.

15
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:35,374
What's the point? Do not find yourself a house
that's such a price ...

16
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,822
Maybe I'll stay elsewhere,
in any house for vacation, or ...

17
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,449
No, that's

18
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,860
Let's see if we find someone
Let us be clear.

19
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,137
Also on ...

20
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,443
I hope you are home.

21
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,900
Rolf familiar.
I came home from vacation.

22
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,951
I know, I know ... you expect.

23
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,318
I am Walker, administrator.
I deal all around.

24
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,586
Join.
Let '.

25
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,004
- You like?
- It's ...

26
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:06,002
- This is home for rent?
- Absolutely!

27
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,974
It's beautiful, right?
Join.

28
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,282
Do your comfortable.

29
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,588
Acomodaþi sure,
I call them up on the owners.

30
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,486
Boy, take care of furniture.
Yes?

31
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,998
- I do not believe it.
- Not me.

32
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,837
Can I leave a little on the outside?

33
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,213
You do not have to come with me.

34
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,085
Not wine, but to stay close.

35
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,486
- You got it?
- Yes.

36
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,123
What are you doing?

37
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,325
What ramshackle-down.
Kill me.

38
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,865
- No need to put the soul.
- I can not abþine.

39
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,204
- Where's Davey?
- On the outside.

40
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,085
Do you mind if I close the door
to escape the smell that?

41
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,452
Marian look.

42
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,559
- Extraordinary.
- Are wonderful.

43
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,694
But they all look the same!

44
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,831
That must have some 100 years.

45
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,431
This is very new.

46
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,205
But how?

47
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:55,146
Wine!

48
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,914
I apologize
that I have left to wait.

49
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,844
I had a terrible morning!

50
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:07,792
If îþi allows program
You can throw that mirror? It's broken.

51
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,860
- It's not only destroyed this way.
- Old beast.

52
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,331
Þâfnoasã Baba!

53
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:26,194
Allardyce are pink.
And my brother will come soon.

54
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,137
Rolf familiar.
My name is Ben.

55
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,107
She is my wife, Marian.

56
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,615
Charmed.

57
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,682
- Do you have and a boy, right?
- Yes, our son, David. It's in the garden.

58
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:40,283
- It's all right?
- Yes, the children cheer this place.

59
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,594
Should discuss the details.

60
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,761
Are you a man practically
Like my brother.

61
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,095
In ad wrote that price is "reasonable".

62
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:57,295
"Very reasonable" as far as I remember.
And it really is, for the right people.

63
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:04,275
If we had "the right person"
what amount should be about?

64
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,614
First I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

65
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,952
You will rent the house just for you?

66
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,219
No. Will and Elizabeth come,
Ben's and rectum.

67
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,453
- How many years does he have?
- 74.

68
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:22,625
An old?
You do not mind and it's around?

69
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,930
No.
Elizabeth is an expensive.

70
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,034
If you sit from 1 July
until early September

71
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,003
'll take care of house
and you'll deal with it?

72
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,006
Just us?

73
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:37,943
Sure.

74
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,244
I do not know what to say,
a house so big ...

75
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,448
Just me and the wife ...

76
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,459
House takes care of her single,
Mr. Rolf.

77
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,557
Believe me.

78
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,298
I'd like to make an issue
of it ...

79
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:58,269
but you will care for the house and we?

80
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,869
I think so.

81
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,212
Suppose that price would be somewhere
around $ 900 ...

82
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,805
- I do not know if ...
- For all summer ...

83
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:14,911
Help!

84
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,312
This is my brother.

85
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,413
Walker, for God!

86
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,456
- Calm down, come now.
- The elevator broke down again.

87
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,698
- Go, go.
- Excuse me.

88
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:28,492
I want to get off.

89
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,796
Incredible, no?

90
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:34,664
It's a bargain.
Do not sit and think.

91
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,868
- Honey ...
- It would be foolish not to accept.

92
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:41,342
I have just þicniþi like them.
Look ...

93
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:46,000
This man is an idiot,
should we give out. Hear?

94
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,183
He is my brother, Arnold.
As you see, is excited about today.

95
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:55,291
You're the ones who will
to rent the house, right?

96
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,863
Yes, just talk details
your sister.

97
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,028
I like Pink.

98
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,298
- And have a son.
- Yes, our son, David.

99
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,238
- Play in the garden.
- Really? Let me see it.

100
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,672
Fast, Pink, to see him.

101
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,941
Here it is.
It's not adorable?

102
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,355
What lovely boy.
How many years does he have? Eight, nine?

103
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,154
- Has 12 years.
- 12? What nice.

104
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,094
It's a little naughty, right?

105
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:42,570
- Sorry, I should walk ...
- No, leave it, okay.

106
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,305
- Închiriaþi often?
- It depends.

107
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:54,307
My sister wants to say
we need calm and relaxation.

108
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,448
I approach the end of the race ...

109
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,424
- Oh, brother ...
- Well said.

110
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,955
We like the house?

111
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,895
- Very much.
- Really?

112
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,299
Tell them how it's summer
when everything comes to life.

113
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:20,034
That's incredible.
I have never seen anything like that ever.

114
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:25,282
Over the centuries have passed this house,
Rolf lady.

115
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,919
Countless years have passed.

116
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:35,520
And this house will last a long time
Once you you will not be.

117
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,855
It is immortal.

118
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,429
- I really believe that.
- And I.

119
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,799
It may seem silly.

120
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,474
But when someone loves a house
and my brother and me ...

121
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,308
I apologize,
I want to be rude, but ...

122
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,510
We're waiting to see what is "and Mecheria".

123
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:03,814
Trick?

124
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,649
Well, with only $ 900 ...

125
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,885
This whole house is ours?

126
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,192
It would be something.

127
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,030
- But not one and Trick.
- It's not

128
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,394
It's about our mother.

129
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,398
What about it?

130
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,503
A woman who looks 85 years 60.

131
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,809
My sister would say ...

132
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,009
our mother
no it never leaves the house.

133
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,018
In fact,
out of her room or not ...

134
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,292
It will not create any problem.

135
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:46,824
Perhaps it'll never see.
He sleeps most of the time.

136
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:52,311
And when not sleeping, listening to music
or working on her collection.

137
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:58,269
Old photos.
It has thousands of photos.

138
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,375
Memories of a lifetime.

139
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,643
A love so much.

140
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:10,749
I just have to leave a tray of food
on the table in the lounge, three times a day.

141
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:19,691
I like to think we least ...

142
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:22,627
- Ben, no!
- Thank you.

143
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,069
- Mom.
- Davey?

144
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:27,971
What happened?

145
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,601
- I hit the knee.
- The wound looks nasty.

146
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,146
- What happened?
- I tripped over something there.

147
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,250
Should i clean the bruises.

148
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:41,611
Let's go into the kitchen.

149
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,987
- Come on, you have some bandages.
- Come on baby.

150
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,829
Where are you taking that plant?

151
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,544
Your sister said she wilted.

152
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,807
Really?

153
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,206
May look it once.

154
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,318
Is not strange?

155
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,128
I think you were rude.

156
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,335
Really?

157
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,612
Those people should go and
to a mental institution.

158
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,115
They let you carry the enthusiasm,
that's all.

159
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,749
Should internaþi.

160
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,658
No such house rents
only $ 900.

161
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,292
Why not?

162
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,764
Maybe not interested in money.
They want someone to take care of the house.

163
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,872
Understand.

164
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,234
Maybe you're right.
But the old woman and a 90-year ...

165
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,242
85.

166
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,802
85 or 100, so what?

167
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,510
And not a woman of her age
with two strangers.

168
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:25,813
You will not have to worry Thi.
I will take it from her.

169
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,427
- Sure. And if you die?
- O Lord!

170
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,698
It matters not so much
for you?

171
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,204
You know I did.

172
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,314
But I will survive.

173
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:59,999
The question is ...
I will survive?

174
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,036
Allardyce.

175
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:19,136
Yes, Mr. Rolf.

176
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,038
Great.
My brother will be happy.

177
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,999
On 1 July.

178
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:31,350
Everything will be ready.
Thank you. Goodbye.

179
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,837
- Sit comfortably?
- No, my whole body shake.

180
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,874
But mouth-Thi see that go.

181
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,456
I forgot to tell you, I want to
driver's license renewed.

182
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,253
Are determined.

183
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,329
Îþi admire perseverenþa, matting Sheet.

184
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,332
That's why they
I took a good long time.

185
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,860
Just to relax
when driving.

186
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:24,375
I am always relaxed driving.
But I have some instructors and I. nervo

187
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,742
We have plenty of space.

188
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,811
I do not believe it.

189
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,013
It's great, right?

190
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,999
It looks abandoned.

191
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,890
You can not.

192
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,145
What happened?

193
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,981
They had to leave.

194
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,379
To go?

195
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:53,791
"Feel-good and not you worry.
Arnold and Roz Allardyce. "

196
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,630
- God.
- I know, is crazy.

197
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,102
If something happens?
How do we give them?

198
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,197
Elders sometimes do silly things.

199
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:08,075
A and E.
But he knew two are almost insane.

200
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,881
- What about the old lady?
- I'll take care of it.

201
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,746
It's your field.
David luggage.

202
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,043
- Marian, I do not believe it!
- And it's all ours.

203
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,203
I'll be right.

204
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,624
Lady Allardyce?

205
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,727
My name is Marian Rolf.
We rent new and i.

206
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,995
Is everything okay?

207
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,500
You need something?

208
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,579
Memories of a lifetime.

209
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:41,983
Marian, where are you?

210
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,801
- What are you doing here?
- Take the tray.

211
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,070
- Have you seen it? What is?
- He sleeps.

212
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,034
We will see later.

213
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,602
Listen.

214
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,010
I will climb into the room just old.

215
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,486
Allardyce is very old lady
and will have to take care of it.

216
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,556
I do not want a bother anyone.

217
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,755
Dur.

218
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:27,457
- Come to see what I found.
- What is it?

219
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,228
Let '.
It's in the kitchen.

220
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,825
Let's see.

221
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:38,071
No clock is not working.
Sin, are so beautiful.

222
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,370
I think we should be back.
One to watch them myself.

223
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,506
You will take care of everything, right?

224
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,584
- Benji!
- Tia.

225
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:55,818
Is not great?

226
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:59,226
- Great.
- Elizabeth Matu Sheet, look.

227
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,561
Lord, are all here.

228
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,367
Benji, here's your first pregnancy.
Need to change the bulb.

229
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,836
Yes.

230
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,541
I'm crazy, right?
Ciudaþi?

231
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,617
Ciudãþeniile can accept this.

232
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,385
- Fuckin 'stopper.
- Do not swear in front of the child.

233
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,550
We take lunch Mrs. Allardyce.
Prepare a snack and you.

234
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,289
- Great, I got it.
- I always said that is good.

235
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,668
Have you seen those old objects?

236
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,467
I think I saw you some chocolate.

237
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,441
Matu <i> Sheet Elizabeth, you've seen
many antiques yet? </ i>

238
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,535
Even here is chocolate.

239
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,538
A full-box.

240
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,242
<i> What you say a toast
for this house </ i>

241
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,003
- Hi, my slave!
- Good.

242
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:12,089
It's great
What have you done?

243
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,388
Where did that?

244
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,194
It was close to wall carpet.

245
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,201
You like?
Worth a fortune.

246
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,964
- I'll take the vacuum cleaner.
- Thank you, baby.

247
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,868
You made itself clear on here?

248
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,033
I have to do and upstairs.
How was the city?

249
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,402
All right.

250
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,638
Not much to it.

251
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,549
- Put the bags in the kitchen.
- I go.

252
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,680
Why not come and see us
as cleans the pool, you might be amused.

253
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,282
Are occupied.

254
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,116
Have you succeeded even now?

255
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,619
If you think so isteþ
Why did you fix it?

256
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,123
Davey, go and show him your father
how to do.

257
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,118
I will show.

258
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,756
I do not undermine
parental authority.

259
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,595
Should gather dirt in the tank.

260
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,071
And you have to fix that pump.

261
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,370
Father.

262
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,810
Look.

263
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,814
On this there compressors
a small object, called switch.

264
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,114
Here you go.
Try.

265
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,756
- Do you think will go?
- I am ready to bet.

266
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,561
- How much chicken?
- $ 5.

267
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,203
Benji, you're a technical genius!

268
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,231
Here's a cemetery.

269
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,986
Father, come and see what I found!
It's an old bicycle.

270
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:04,766
You know, Davey? All those îngropaþi
here are the Allardyce family.

271
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,199
I found no grave
for after 1890.

272
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,207
Bit strange.

273
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,907
Want a candy bãieþelule?

274
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:25,516
- Leave me alone!
- You can not get rid of me!

275
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:00,481
Lady Allardyce?

276
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,721
Are you okay?

277
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,730
I am concerned.

278
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:10,232
A week since I came in November,
did you eat almost anything.

279
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,770
You do not like food?
That told me to bring you pink.

280
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,371
Coborâþi night in the kitchen?
That's how you doing?

281
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:29,314
Lady Allardyce,
please answer me.

282
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,563
Where is mother?
She said she comes and she does not?

283
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,767
You know like your mother ...

284
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,041
May do what you lungs?

285
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,479
There are as before.

286
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,246
- Do you smoke too much.
- I know.

287
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,583
And I drink too much ...

288
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:06,789
I am an old woman
will not take 80 years ...

289
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:38,453
You put chlorine in the pool?
You know it kills germs.

290
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:43,425
I do not worry respects microbes
but snakes and sea.

291
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,218
When you go in the pool?

292
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,996
Go and ask her your mother.

293
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,572
- Quickly!
- I'm going.

294
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,343
<i> Mother </ i>

295
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,012
<i> Mother, are you up? </ i>

296
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,683
Let <i> swimming mother </ i>

297
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:01,766
I found it on anywhere.
We searched the whole house.

298
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,603
Do not worry.
It's probably the bathroom.

299
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,060
Great?

300
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,444
Move to jump, Father.

301
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,985
- You should go to the Olympics.
- Sure ...

302
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,492
What is that?

303
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,103
Nothing.

304
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,841
And get me.

305
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:16,810
Maybe you're doing well with the ball.
But you are a weak swimmer.

306
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,241
I'm going anyway.

307
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,953
Davey!
The pool is deep!

308
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,923
Do not give large.

309
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,956
A large snake.

310
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,263
Help!

311
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,715
- Do you feel like playing, Davey?
- Yes.

312
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,513
- Want to throw?
- Yes.

313
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,020
Get on my shoulders.

314
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,021
Ben, no!

315
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:09,560
- It was moving to!
- Do you want?

316
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,501
End.
It is enough.

317
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,372
Benji, you're worse
rãsfãþat than a child.

318
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,415
- That was powerful.
- Îþi like, Davey?

319
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,508
What are you doing?

320
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,211
Stops you!

321
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:12,155
Lord.
Drown.

322
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,253
It's past 2:00.

323
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,160
Yes?

324
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,328
Could you sleep?

325
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,733
- A little.
- Want to try?

326
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,906
A little later, maybe.

327
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,556
- I'll smoke here, right?
- Why not? If not you like, exit! It

328
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,291
You wanted to hurt him Davey.

329
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,530
Just play your
the out of control.

330
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,105
You've never been face.

331
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,141
A and E.

332
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,508
I'm sorry ...

333
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:29,450
But I can not think of anything else.
I can not get that out of mind.

334
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,122
Ben, I know how are you.

335
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,985
- I know I've wanted to do something like that.
- Bullshit.

336
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,063
I wanted to hurt him, do not understand?

337
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:45,389
You're sure punishment.
Davey is right. It's good.

338
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,436
If there is something more complex
îþi only imagine?

339
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,802
What do you mean?

340
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,614
Those dreams,
the death of my mother ...

341
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,118
... Returned.

342
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,724
Baby, it's been so long.

343
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:20,531
There's nothing wrong.
Absolutely nothing.

344
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,451
Lord.

345
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:51,000
It completely changed.
Looks like new.

346
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,431
It's all available to you.
Îþi like?

347
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:09,639
It's great.

348
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:15,000
I removed the TV,
not fit here anyway.

349
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,086
Now just
I find something to do.

350
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,093
There are many things
you can do.

351
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:28,796
You could start working on PhD.

352
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:35,234
- It's all right, right?
- Room?

353
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:42,000
No, what happened yesterday.
Uiþi must.

354
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,607
Let's go over what happened
and they again from the beginning, ok?

355
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:59,220
What nice.
David wants to learn to paint.

356
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,061
You going to find some landscapes.

357
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,768
Hi, Davey.

358
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:21,274
- How do you feel?
- Okay.

359
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:27,017
- Thi've got tools, Davey?
- Yes.

360
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:35,008
- Friends?
- Father!

361
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:41,705
- Not want to get in the pool.
- You do not have.

362
00:45:42,146 --> 00:45:44,477
Îþi promise.

363
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,342
I do not like to go to bed
without you.

364
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,483
I am here in a while.

365
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,151
I know.

366
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:54,397
- Filter the pool seems to function, right?
- Yes, because someone isteþ.

367
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,011
The rest ...

368
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,613
It seems that everything ...

369
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,481
Smells like detergent?

370
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:08,187
I polished furniture.
I washed floors.

371
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,789
What, honey?

372
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,893
I came here ...

373
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,633
just to see if I could.

374
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,538
I thought it would go
more than that.

375
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,542
I tried.

376
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:43,390
- Looks like you got a þicnit.
- And so do you.

377
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,499
The pool looks great,
why not take a bath?

378
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:58,699
- You go and you?
- I did suit me.

379
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,508
What would have to go without?

380
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,944
Me first?

381
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,326
Come on.
It's great.

382
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:22,660
- It will help you get over it?
- Yes.

383
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,595
Why not?

384
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,636
Give Thi down everything.

385
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,412
Come.

386
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,455
The more I was alone.

387
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:58,555
I am missing you.

388
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:07,539
There's time, honey.

389
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,107
It's a water sport.

390
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,506
Good for circulation.

391
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,117
Okay my circulation.

392
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,958
Go back!

393
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,328
- Marian?
- See that you ...

394
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:48,784
I'm not saying to be something extraordinary,
after 13 years ...

395
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:53,445
But even less passion.

396
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:07,236
Do not understand. How I became
repulsive so suddenly?

397
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,236
Repulsive?

398
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,475
You're very sexy.

399
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:50,973
Ben, I do not want!

400
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:56,081
Not here.

401
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,981
Marian, for God.

402
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,515
Please do not understand.

403
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,162
You do not have ...

404
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,784
Good morning.

405
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,004
- Where did you find this?
- In the hall closet.

406
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,532
This house is full of valuable things.

407
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,868
You never came to bed last night, right?

408
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,736
When I came by the pool ...

409
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:09,341
I was in the room Mrs. Allardyce
to see if it needs something.

410
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:15,056
I slept in a chair.
I think I was very tired.

411
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,530
Where are you going?

412
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:31,301
I'm going to clean the driveway ...
to do something.

413
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,669
What about you?
It's already lunch.

414
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:11,645
Can not someone to sleep
more in this family?

415
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,799
I find it strange, matting Elizabeth Sheet.
Usually have more power than us.

416
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:21,245
I.
Vacation makes me exhausted.

417
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:25,192
You stayed too long in the sun.
Why not paint somewhere in the shade?

418
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:29,388
Lord!
I have to go to the hairdresser.

419
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,331
Stop pet.

420
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,400
No one would need
a visit to the hairdresser.

421
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:43,103
- And you're încãrunþe start.
- I know.

422
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,999
I think the rectum inherit and to Mary.

423
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:50,043
At 33 years already fully bed.

424
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:55,216
Davey is looking for.
He wants to go on a trip.

425
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,427
What's so funny?

426
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:01,922
You know what I'd like to do now?

427
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,693
To go back to bed.

428
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:10,430
- It's not awful?
- No.

429
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,636
Why do not you sleep a little?
One to tell you do well.

430
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,539
Maybe I will.

431
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,578
I'll do it!

432
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,223
For God, Elizabeth,
What about you?

433
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,889
Lady Allardyce?

434
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,058
Can I enter?

435
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,228
I knew that you're here.

436
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,128
You should not be in bed?

437
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:22,134
I think they know
on our host.

438
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:23,903
Sleeps.

439
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,932
Too bad.

440
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,608
I thought I would like
to see my work.

441
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,909
I'm sure, but when she wakes up.

442
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:41,586
- Elizabeth, you have some business.
- Sorry, I did not want to interrupt you.

443
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:45,822
- Tell him that I wanted to see her.
- We appreciate the intention.

444
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:49,355
- And if you want to stay with someone ...
- I'll say.

445
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:52,859
Take care on stairs.

446
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:57,164
Go back to your job.
I'll be fine.

447
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,670
Davey!

448
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,670
- What happened?
- Gases.

449
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:30,305
- God! Is that okay?
- Yes, breathing.

450
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:32,805
Breathing, boy.

451
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,353
Hold it, I'll be right back.

452
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,004
Breathe.

453
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,462
- Are you all right, Davey?
- I think it's better.

454
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:23,528
What happened?

455
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,297
Damn stove ...

456
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:32,000
Do not understand how it could happen
something like that.

457
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,077
Have you had breakfast?

458
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,715
No, I fell asleep again.
Infact.

459
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,388
- How is Davey?
- It's good.

460
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:57,196
Ben led him into the city.
Davey's okay, thank God.

461
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,462
Nor I know what fear was.

462
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,363
Poor Davey.

463
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,740
I want to know
I do not I touched that stove.

464
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,719
- Of course not.
- I'd remembered.

465
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:25,018
- Nobody said anything like that.
- I just wrapped.

466
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:28,928
Have you covered?
Davey you were in his room last night?

467
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:34,400
Yes, I wanted to see what it does.
Sometimes I sleep.

468
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,136
What have you done to his room?

469
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:43,978
Thi I said, I just wrapped.
It was cold.

470
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,647
This house becomes more cold.

471
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:50,007
Doors to the room by Davey
is always open.

472
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,621
Last night was locked.

473
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,816
I locked myself.

474
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,824
I grabbed anything
only blanket that I wrapped.

475
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,562
Just as I remember.

476
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,599
Well, I've locked it too.
It was locked alone!

477
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,801
But the windows?

478
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,005
Were open.

479
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:21,049
They were closed when Ben entered the room.
Come Thi senses, Elizabeth!

480
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,942
As I could?

481
01:05:25,754 --> 01:05:30,817
How ...
when þipi to me and accuse me?

482
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:33,390
Do not accuse.

483
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,431
Where's Ben?

484
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,333
Benji I would think.

485
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,967
And I believe you.

486
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,267
Not true.
It's obvious.

487
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,103
May all forget something
from time to time.

488
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,271
At your age ...

489
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:59,000
Do not forget anything!
I know what I did!

490
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,947
Sure, my dear.

491
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,861
How about cooking something to tell you
for breakfast?

492
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:13,228
But old ...

493
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,237
I am so confused ... Mrs. ...

494
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:17,771
Allardyce.

495
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:20,701
- Yes! Maybe it ...
- Elizabeth Matu Sheet!

496
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,202
Get this over with!

497
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,850
Tell Ben that are above.

498
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,489
Îþi bring breakfast room.

499
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,432
Just as I take him and them?

500
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,068
Other old?

501
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,066
Do not bother.

502
01:07:09,597 --> 01:07:10,787
Elizabeth.

503
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:16,487
- Benji.
- I woke up?

504
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,172
Are you OK?

505
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,914
You feel like drinking a martini
on the terrace?

506
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,313
You know what I said?

507
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:39,610
He was angry.
I spoke seriously.

508
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,586
He has no right
to talk to me and a.

509
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,692
Better die ...

510
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,755
Better die
than to do him harm by Davey.

511
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,727
You two do not you have ever fought.
What happened now?

512
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:57,100
Ask her your wife.

513
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:03,301
- Perhaps because they are old.
- Elizabeth, you are not old.

514
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:07,545
That does not mean
minds that I lost.

515
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:14,176
If I have closed the windows or door,
So how she said ...

516
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:16,818
I'm sure I said something like that.

517
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,224
I'd remember ...

518
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,162
Such things do not look.

519
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:26,694
I'd forgotten to something so important, right?

520
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:34,299
Sorry, Benji.
But I was very angry.

521
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,279
I do not like here.
I want to leave this house.

522
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:44,214
And you feel the same.
I know that.

523
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,225
Nervo and we all i.

524
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:57,061
How about to come down ...
and to drink?

525
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:01,102
And give him the opportunity to Marian
-and to apologize.

526
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,435
All right.

527
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,904
Just for you.

528
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,309
I love you.

529
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,074
You know that?

530
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:41,876
Ben, you scared me.

531
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:45,212
You know how much you upset her?

532
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,618
I'm sorry, but last night
it was in his room.

533
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,514
Why would minds?

534
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:56,849
I said lying.
Just that and not remember.

535
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:03,227
And she's to blame for all other
strange things in this house?

536
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:10,563
Do not understand what you mean.

537
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,536
Let's go down.

538
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:17,043
Should not they know it and I?

539
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,812
- Where is it?
- In her room, sleeping.

540
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,581
No one likes to come here.

541
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,827
Her collection.

542
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,871
You'll close here.

543
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,610
Why are you the so nervous?

544
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,045
I am not.
But I want to upset.

545
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,344
Why þii that locked door?

546
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,251
That's how she prefers.
It's just an old lady.

547
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,090
- It ...
- Thi gave the key?

548
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,588
No, the key was in the envelope
left by Mrs. Allardyce.

549
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:15,162
And watches the keys to this
were all in the envelope?

550
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:20,564
Watch keys were in their enclosures.
Why do you ask?

551
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:25,209
Do not understand how you have time to deal
only one of all these clocks.

552
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:27,145
So.

553
01:11:30,586 --> 01:11:32,417
I sure did.

554
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:39,156
What is this, an interrogation?

555
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,721
What's this?

556
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:46,934
And get you something?
Not to bother you?

557
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:51,169
- What you think?
- Do not know what to think.

558
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,005
Can you tell me.

559
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,207
I'll try.

560
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:04,113
I'm sorry for what happened
last night at the pool.

561
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,220
I do not know of a bore and I a.

562
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:13,419
Do you need more time
to find yourself a better excuse.

563
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,238
Davey.

564
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,338
Look what you did!

565
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,706
- Do not lay a hand on anything!
- I wanted to break it.

566
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:32,713
Do not touch you anymore
of precious things.

567
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,736
- What is happening with you?
- Nothing.

568
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:10,403
Then you react like that
Davey broke when that vessel?

569
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,878
This house ...

570
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,317
It's more than I thought.

571
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:25,550
This house is not yours.
It's not our property, understand?

572
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,986
But it is my responsibility
how to take care of it sitting here, right?

573
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,629
Please be patient.
I need more time.

574
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:42,571
Why?
To get involved and more?

575
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:45,471
Summer is the end and knives.

576
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:55,120
- I to tell you a question?
- Of course.

577
01:14:56,458 --> 01:15:00,719
What's more important to you?
House and all that ...

578
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,999
... Or us?

579
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,964
What question is that?

580
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,662
Okay, rephrase.

581
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,706
If you were to ask me thi ...

582
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,474
you cancel the house?

583
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,845
To quit?

584
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:22,875
Why?

585
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,990
If I were to be reached in time to Davey?

586
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:34,353
What does that have to do with the house?
Or leave us?

587
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:39,863
I can not believe you talk seriously.

588
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:41,735
I'm serious.

589
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,471
Do you know how ridiculous call?

590
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:53,577
You mean that the house
is to blame for what happens?

591
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,212
You leave, and asked if I was thi that?

592
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:03,283
Even if everything would be in my imagination?

593
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,190
You do it?

594
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:12,224
Father!
Mom!

595
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,266
Matu and of Elizabeth!

596
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,908
Up.

597
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,574
God.

598
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,416
Marian Davey take it from here.
Now!

599
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:45,258
What number is that Dr.
call it when Davey was sick?

600
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:49,432
- Where is the phone?
- On mãsuþa lobby.

601
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:51,633
Stay with it.

602
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,974
Have you called?

603
01:17:37,016 --> 01:17:38,474
No.

604
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:40,819
Got busy.

605
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:43,517
Can not always busy.

606
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:45,454
No?

607
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:51,790
Across busy.
Wherever we tried.

608
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:55,796
Even the office.

609
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,836
Do not be surprised?

610
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,503
Do not understand what you mean.

611
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:05,071
And I'll try.

612
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,212
That's how you do.

613
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:44,885
- I succeeded.
- Yes?

614
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:49,152
But everywhere busy.
I was my imagination.

615
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:51,086
I'm sure.

616
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,288
What matters
is that the doctor will come.

617
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,777
Can I do anything?

618
01:19:06,469 --> 01:19:09,633
No.
See what makes Davey.

619
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,337
Stay down and waiting for it to doctor.

620
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:29,201
Ash from the ash Sheet Sheet,
ground of the earth.

621
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:36,338
And I hope in an eternal life
through our Savior Jesus ...

622
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,079
Because of her faith,
this courageous woman

623
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,241
received eternal peace
Besides our Creator ...

624
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,619
the heavenly kingdom ...

625
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:49,149
And even if a complaint now
do not forget

626
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:54,355
and that the new will be given eternal life,
as a reward for our good works.

627
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:05,732
I love candlelit dinner.

628
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:15,647
- Life goes on, right?
- Why not?

629
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,911
- Do not standby EMS, darling?
- To be honest ...

630
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,715
I'm not hungry.

631
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:30,361
Elizabeth's death.
That does not mean anything to you?

632
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,025
Yes.
Davey!

633
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:39,397
It does not matter anything to you
In addition to this unfortunate house!

634
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:41,438
It's not true.

635
01:24:43,812 --> 01:24:47,475
Why did not you come
Elizabeth II's funeral and rectum?

636
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,609
You know I can not let a single
Mrs. Allardyce.

637
01:24:57,525 --> 01:25:01,154
Not good to put glass directly
on the table this beautiful mahogany.

638
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,824
Pour into a glass-Thi
and glass go into the kitchen.

639
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,061
- But no longer drinks.
- Take a cup.

640
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,061
Is better than glass.
It's silver.

641
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:14,475
But I want a drink, not a cup.

642
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:19,574
Do you say mother, Davey.
Stain the table.

643
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:25,652
- Do not standby EMS?
- Thi I said I'm not hungry.

644
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,656
Neither me, now.

645
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:56,343
I call her old.

646
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,782
I want to see.

647
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:04,925
Stay away from the door!

648
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,686
- Marian, unlock the door a.
- I can not.

649
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,457
Safe is the key to it.
The door is locked.

650
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:17,777
What you know about it?
Tell me!

651
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:19,872
Let me go ...

652
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:22,969
Please.

653
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:26,944
We leave this house ...

654
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:34,818
Did you hear?
Get out of here.

655
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,182
How to go?

656
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:39,617
How?

657
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,819
We make bags and leave.

658
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,936
- Can you lock this room before?
- Stop it.

659
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:53,337
I just thinking about this house
and the elderly.

660
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,068
It's dependent on me.

661
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:58,274
Just me.

662
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:04,018
Nobody can take care of it
apart from me.

663
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,818
Do not think ...

664
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:13,493
Are you obsessed with this house!

665
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:17,189
- For all that is here.
- I'm not obsessed.

666
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,068
We destroy this house.

667
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:32,200
Honey, this house represents
everything we wanted.

668
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:35,205
And now is ours ...

669
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:38,599
As long as ...

670
01:27:41,659 --> 01:27:42,999
Marian ...

671
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:47,059
Whether you come with us or not ...

672
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:49,960
Tomorrow ...

673
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:53,058
back.

674
01:27:53,107 --> 01:27:55,234
What?

675
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,999
What we had before.

676
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,331
I had nothing.

677
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,944
But what we have now?

678
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:00,050
- Davey, wake up.
- What is it?

679
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:02,061
- Wake up, we gotta go.
- Why?

680
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:03,891
Because this house.

681
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:05,792
- Everything changes.
- What?

682
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:09,231
Bricks þiglele.

683
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:13,964
Replace ...

684
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:15,994
with new ones.

685
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:18,204
Do not ask questions.
We must make a move.

686
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:20,246
- Dad, wait a little.
- Go.

687
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:49,899
Father!

688
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:01,148
- Wait!
- Get in the car!

689
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:43,527
Lord!

690
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:52,598
Stops you, Dad!

691
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:11,784
Waiting for my mother!

692
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,886
Stops, please.

693
01:33:57,431 --> 01:34:01,564
I do not know what happened.
I think it was hit on the head.

694
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:04,637
It's good.
We go back.

695
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:10,299
THI Thiele apparently normal
what happens ...

696
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:13,337
because you're involved.

697
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,623
Are you involved
in what happens here.

698
01:34:55,124 --> 01:34:58,523
Dad, what about you?

699
01:35:17,411 --> 01:35:19,572
Doctor, will be better?

700
01:35:26,987 --> 01:35:30,388
It is highly sedated,
will sleep all night.

701
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:33,300
But tomorrow morning
will be hospitalized.

702
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,768
Understand.

703
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:39,793
We do not have the necessary facilities here.
Will be taken to a hospital in the city.

704
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:44,168
But it will be good?

705
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:48,537
It's not my field,
but with careful attention ...

706
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:50,633
I'm sure I can take care of me.

707
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,339
If you need me tomorrow
I find the cabinet.

708
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:56,143
- Thank you.
- I must not driving.

709
01:36:08,283 --> 01:36:09,550
Mother?

710
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:12,963
Tata feels good?

711
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,836
Yes, the doctor said
he needed rest.

712
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:23,639
- You are right?
- Yes.

713
01:36:24,879 --> 01:36:26,813
Tomorrow we go home?

714
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:33,215
I do not think, honey.
Your father will be better here.

715
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:37,446
You should sleep.
Good night.

716
01:37:08,389 --> 01:37:10,584
Davey, exit the water,
mass is almost ready.

717
01:37:10,771 --> 01:37:13,069
Come on, Mom,
I do not go where it is deep.

718
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:15,524
You spent enough.
Where Thi-e robe?

719
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:18,024
I think I left my room.

720
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:20,965
Stand with your father, I bring him Thi.

721
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:52,473
Hey, Dad.
Are you OK?

722
01:37:59,139 --> 01:38:01,073
Want to see what swimming?

723
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:04,972
I know pretty well now.
I practiced all day.

724
01:38:05,512 --> 01:38:07,946
Want to see how swimming
in deep water?

725
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:10,539
Now I can swim there.

726
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:12,649
Well, be careful.

727
01:38:12,753 --> 01:38:15,620
I practiced for you.
Look.

728
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:53,593
Davey!
Do not swim there!

729
01:39:11,804 --> 01:39:14,000
Father!

730
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,198
Help me!

731
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:53,935
Are you OK, honey?

732
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:12,518
I tried ...

733
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:26,571
Father!
Talk.

734
01:42:34,615 --> 01:42:36,405
I could only watch.

735
01:42:43,323 --> 01:42:47,056
I know, honey.
Not that you could move.

736
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:52,290
I hate this place.
I want you out of here.

737
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:55,494
We leave.

738
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:01,733
Get out of here.
Even today.

739
01:43:16,957 --> 01:43:18,822
You said you are going.

740
01:43:18,926 --> 01:43:21,486
Go, baby.
Right now.

741
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:33,170
Are you OK?
Are you sure?

742
01:43:52,392 --> 01:43:55,623
I forgot to tell Mrs. Allardyce
that leave.

743
01:43:58,134 --> 01:44:02,094
Marian ... please.

744
01:44:03,303 --> 01:44:05,770
I do not want to go back to that house.

745
01:44:07,307 --> 01:44:08,774
Ben ...

746
01:44:09,342 --> 01:44:14,800
We can not leave
free to call old.

747
01:44:18,151 --> 01:44:22,676
- Mom, let's go at once.
- Please, do not return home.

748
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:25,699
We let our numbers,

749
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:29,217
like to know where we can find
If you need help.

750
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:31,258
Does not last long.

751
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:03,381
Lady Allardyce?
I am.

752
01:46:04,925 --> 01:46:06,690
Marian.

753
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:30,669
I'm going there take it your mother.

754
01:50:02,829 --> 01:50:04,790
Marian, you're here?

755
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:25,581
Lady Allardyce?

756
01:50:52,512 --> 01:50:55,545
I do not want to bother you,
look for Marian.

757
01:50:55,648 --> 01:51:00,447
He said he comes
to tell you that we go.

758
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,923
Lady Allardyce ...

759
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:11,999
I know you came here.

760
01:51:14,467 --> 01:51:18,096
Are you sure you talked to her.
I can tell you where it is?

761
01:51:22,008 --> 01:51:25,473
I have a question.
I answer, please?

762
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,475
I answer?

763
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,775
I answer?

764
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,299
Marian?

765
01:51:46,166 --> 01:51:48,157
I expect, Ben.

766
01:51:58,611 --> 01:51:59,678
God!

767
01:52:34,101 --> 01:52:35,252
Mom!

768
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:23,452
It's wonderful.

769
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:28,492
Mãreaþã ... as it once was.

770
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:31,999
And our mother ...

771
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:34,637
S back.

772
01:53:34,808 --> 01:53:36,837
Our treasure.

773
01:53:37,744 --> 01:53:39,234
It was played ...

774
01:53:40,146 --> 01:53:42,507
... In all its brilliance.

775
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:44,946
Mãreþia them ...

776
01:53:45,018 --> 01:53:48,377
... Belongs to us again.

777
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:32,357
