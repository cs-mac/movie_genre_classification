1
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:15,164
The person who saved you...

2
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,133
is going to be the deity
that takes away your soul.

3
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:18,802
That means you're going to die.

4
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:20,637
What?

5
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:36,053
Oh, hello.

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,800
What are you guys talking about?

7
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,959
- It's nothing.
- I'm not done yet.

8
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:46,729
- I said there's a surprising turn.
- Yeom Mi.

9
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,465
It's not your boyfriend.

10
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,202
At first, I also thought it'd be him.

11
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:57,007
But the man in the wet running
shoes finally revealed himself.

12
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,378
It was an older man.

13
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:03,947
- An older man?
- Yes.

14
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,817
I'm so glad that it's not
your boyfriend here, but...

15
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:12,322
This man.

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,491
It's him.

17
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:22,599
What?

18
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:27,603
This man. Who is he?

19
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:29,005
Why do you have a picture of him?

20
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,054
(The Bride of Habaek)

21
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:48,625
(Final Episode)

22
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:53,563
Hey.

23
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,099
- Have you been well?
- Where have you been?

24
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,769
I thought I'd be able to take care
of the business sooner, but...

25
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,371
What business?

26
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:10,480
Hello.

27
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,350
There's no need to greet. You, over there.

28
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,019
So Ah's friend, Jo Yeom Mi.

29
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:18,421
How about you get going now?

30
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:20,557
This woman and I don't have much time.

31
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,198
Who is that?

32
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,601
Just go home. Knowing too much
isn't good for your sake.

33
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:33,102
By the way, what should
we do about my dream?

34
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:35,384
- The death deity is your dad...
- Stop spewing nonsense.

35
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,307
You just had a bad dream.

36
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:39,742
Hey, I clearly saw your dad.

37
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,210
It was that man in the photo.

38
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:43,078
- This is...
- What you said doesn't make sense.

39
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,015
- Why not?
- You said the one who saved me...

40
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,716
will take away my soul.

41
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:51,488
But my dad has never saved me.

42
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,894
Get going. And just
forget that stupid dream.

43
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:03,200
Go on.

44
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,360
Why is this...

45
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,171
Why did he do something so pointless?

46
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:42,972
You went to look for the tablet?

47
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,507
We don't have to find it, but I kept
getting a bad feeling about it.

48
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:47,576
- It took longer than I thought.
- Did you find it?

49
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:49,144
No, not exactly.

50
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,780
I just found its remnants.

51
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,648
Now, I need to put the pieces together.

52
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,216
Whatever it is, do it at Moo Ra's place.

53
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,818
I'm busy, so don't bother me.

54
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,220
The messenger must've come.

55
00:03:58,255 --> 00:03:59,623
How much time do you have?

56
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:01,223
Six days.

57
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,393
I heard you went back, then came back.

58
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,282
Are you thinking about not going back?

59
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:10,099
You know that's the worst
move you can make, right?

60
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,368
That much I know.

61
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:14,337
It's not like I can stay here
if I choose not to go back.

62
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,672
Right.

63
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,475
- I should say goodbye to her.
- Hey.

64
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:22,846
This way.

65
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:08,058
He's leaving.

66
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,625
Goodbye.

67
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,228
You're two peas in a pod. Neither
of you is asking me to stay.

68
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,099
Is that your father?

69
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:18,968
Yes.

70
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,739
Did he make his daughter carry his burden?

71
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,107
- Still no word from him?
- Pardon me?

72
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,843
Do you want to find him?

73
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,182
Get going. Stop saying useless things.

74
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:34,851
Have a good time!

75
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,154
Gosh, I'm leaving.

76
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,169
Make sure you shut the door properly.

77
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,651
Do this.

78
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:12,255
Who knows when you'll do
this yourself after I leave?

79
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,628
Saying you've forgotten
someone means the opposite.

80
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:21,902
Saying you hate someone means that
you don't actually hate that person.

81
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,313
A part of your heart stays intact
even when everything falls apart.

82
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:30,774
When you lie, it's so obvious.

83
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,078
That's you.

84
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,593
You said...

85
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:54,798
your wish was to meet your
father and tell him everything.

86
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:58,401
I'm sorry I never got to realize your wish.

87
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,672
I'm a deity.

88
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:08,478
I'm sorry I couldn't even
do that much as a deity.

89
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:13,416
So...

90
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,020
find him after I leave.

91
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,689
Do your best to find him.

92
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,993
Even if your father turns out to
be the worst man in the world,

93
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,096
find him.

94
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:32,902
As you said, you're now a
grown-up who can handle it.

95
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,473
Find him, get the answer,

96
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,942
lift the weight off your mind,

97
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:42,312
and get out of that darkness.

98
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:48,418
To think...

99
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,522
that you will still be in
that darkness after I leave,

100
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:56,759
I'd go crazy.

101
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:23,586
Go check on him.

102
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,455
See if he is ready to leave.

103
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:27,624
He will leave.

104
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:30,526
- I don't have a good feeling.
- He will leave.

105
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:34,297
He knows what will happen otherwise.
He knows better than that.

106
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:51,781
Joo Dong is here.

107
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,856
Where have you been?

108
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:03,760
If you block your signals
again, we'll cut you off.

109
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:06,428
Ha Baek kicked me out.

110
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,664
You met him?

111
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:11,967
So the message came?

112
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,602
He's not thinking of
something stupid, is he?

113
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:14,770
Not really.

114
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:17,072
You've been looking for the tablet?

115
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:20,777
Yes, I thought I'd find it
where I fell, but I couldn't.

116
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:24,112
I realized I could have
lost it somewhere else,

117
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:28,150
so I've been looking
everywhere I've ever been.

118
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,485
That's why it took so long.

119
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,588
- But you couldn't find it?
- No.

120
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,891
But I at least know who took it.

121
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,860
Who took it? Humans couldn't see it.

122
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:41,631
Some humans can.

123
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,834
Can I sleep here tonight?

124
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,704
I'll be visiting some places from tomorrow.

125
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,305
- No!
- No!

126
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,853
Love is the problem.

127
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,091
- Soo Ri.
- Lord Joo Dong.

128
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,726
Where are you?

129
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:11,260
I'm on the street.

130
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,396
Why? Did you meet Ha Baek?

131
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,064
He kicked me out. Where are you?

132
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,233
Can't you let me in?

133
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:19,335
I'm working.

134
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:20,636
I can't come home tonight.

135
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:23,706
You're leaving anyway. Why
would you work so hard?

136
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,841
Ha Baek wants me to make a lot of money.

137
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,110
Fine. Hang up.

138
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,380
Gosh, money is the problem.

139
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,857
- What are you doing here?
- It's an emergency.

140
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:42,804
Someone will take her soul away?

141
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:45,294
You mean Ms. Descendant is going to die?

142
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:46,829
Yes.

143
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:50,700
Do you hate her so much that
you wish she would die?

144
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,768
You said your dreams are
your unconscious desires.

145
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,570
I thought it was precognition.

146
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:57,005
But my ability to foretell
the future is weak.

147
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,775
I need to complement it...

148
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,744
with your help.

149
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:04,147
And you're leaving soon.

150
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,087
Sorry?

151
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:15,958
Hello. 50 chickens? Okay.

152
00:11:35,812 --> 00:11:38,147
It's not like him to sleep in.

153
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,767
I waited for you to come wake me up.

154
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,702
Why?

155
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,740
Just because.

156
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:11,047
I have a present for you.

157
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,721
I would have wanted to get you
the fanciest one there is,

158
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:22,592
but I couldn't find anything nicer
than what the female deity gave you.

159
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:26,763
So I found one that would suit you best.

160
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,237
I've been meaning to get you some clothes.

161
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:38,174
Wear this on our date today.

162
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:39,909
- Date?
- Yes.

163
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,444
Like we wanted to last time.

164
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,047
We'll get some good food, do
fun things, and buy clothes.

165
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,251
Today, tomorrow, and the
day after tomorrow.

166
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,318
Let's leave the car here.

167
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,688
Let's walk and take the bus and subway.

168
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:54,791
- Just because.
- Just because.

169
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,512
Here.

170
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,885
Rock-paper-scissors.

171
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,086
Yes!

172
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,588
Here you go.

173
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,624
Rock-paper-scissors.

174
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:36,532
Why do you lose every time?

175
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,906
- One more round.
- The bus is here.

176
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,142
Or maybe not.

177
00:13:48,644 --> 00:13:49,884
It's nice to be outside, right?

178
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,315
- Especially with me, right?
- Yes.

179
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm thirsty too.

180
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:05,527
Their specialty is cold noodles.

181
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:06,762
But you don't eat cold food.

182
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,898
I want to try.

183
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,701
Wouldn't it be nice if at
least one problem is solved?

184
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,569
I want to show you.

185
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:19,141
All right. Let me try.

186
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:45,635
It wasn't that bad.

187
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:48,004
I didn't have to be so scared.

188
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,240
What a shame.

189
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,709
Why are you laughing?

190
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:30,713
Ha Baek.

191
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,884
What? Because I called your name?

192
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,854
It's okay with everyone else,

193
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:42,625
but with you, I was afraid...

194
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,895
my feelings would be shown
if I called your name.

195
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,798
I didn't want you to see them.

196
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:54,236
Ha Baek.

197
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:56,706
We had noodles today.

198
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:58,739
You can play rock-paper-scissors, right?

199
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:02,511
If you win, he will draw a portrait of us.

200
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,014
Only if you win.

201
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,882
If you lose, you get nothing.

202
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:12,221
Rock-paper-scissors.

203
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,224
One more time. Rock-paper-scissors.

204
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,360
You're quite good.

205
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:18,961
Rock-paper-scissors.

206
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:22,865
You won!

207
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,800
Good job.

208
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,236
Give me a second.

209
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:35,845
Please sit down. She'll be back soon.

210
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,717
You're very good at rock-paper-scissors.

211
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,452
What's your secret?

212
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:46,254
Secret? How crude. Such word
can't explain my excellence.

213
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,591
I never lose.

214
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,594
You're very impressive.

215
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:59,568
It looks like your bride asked my
wife to prepare something for her.

216
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:01,837
My bride?

217
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,008
There. There she is.

218
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,141
Do I look pretty?

219
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:16,445
Ha Baek?

220
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:20,950
Do I look pretty?

221
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,185
Yes.

222
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:33,929
Photographs...

223
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,099
fade with time, you know.

224
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:41,536
I heard that pencil lead
is made with a material...

225
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,657
that never fades away no
matter how much time passes.

226
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:47,343
Your face will be...

227
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:50,779
remembered more vividly than
it looks in photographs,

228
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:55,885
so I thought it'd be better to leave
a portrait that won't fade away.

229
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:04,226
You have to face this
way for me to draw you.

230
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:11,534
The groom, please.

231
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:19,942
Hold on a second!

232
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:25,648
I forgot this.

233
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:29,451
You two look picturesquely beautiful.

234
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:38,727
All right.

235
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:03,219
My gosh.

236
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:06,822
What a nice office.

237
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:14,964
You don't need to feel bad.

238
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,299
It is true that you put
me through a lot though.

239
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,900
I'm sorry.

240
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:22,036
That's how life goes. Don't worry about it.

241
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:25,007
Actually, there's something
I want to ask you.

242
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,643
- What is it?
- I'm looking for someone,

243
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,479
and I think that person is in your life.

244
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,815
Whom are you looking for?

245
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:35,784
Shall I say it's the person who saved you?

246
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,487
The person who saved me?

247
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,856
I lost the tablet that day.

248
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:46,294
So in backtracking my steps from that spot,

249
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:48,397
I ended up tracing your steps too.

250
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:50,665
I found out that your
stepmother, Shin Mi Jung,

251
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,500
found you wandering around
the Gate of Deities...

252
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,669
and took you home that day...

253
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,605
as well as the fact that
there was one more person.

254
00:20:57,606 --> 00:20:59,374
Yes, that's right.

255
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,776
That night,

256
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:03,211
hours after you left,

257
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:05,014
a man found me.

258
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,483
He took me to a hospital and left,

259
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:11,120
but I found out who he is through
the traces that he left.

260
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,156
It was the man you met.

261
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:17,226
Why are you looking for him though?

262
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:20,529
It looks like he found it and took it.

263
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,364
Did he tell you where he was headed?

264
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,368
He said in passing that he
was going to meet someone.

265
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,670
I was in a critical condition,

266
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:30,539
so my mother and I left first that day.

267
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,042
After that day, my mother told me...

268
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:35,577
that he was on his way to his
wife's grave which was nearby.

269
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:38,058
He returned from abroad after
being away for a year,

270
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,649
and he didn't know about his wife's death.

271
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:43,184
We never heard from him after that day.

272
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:44,986
My mother tried very hard to find him,

273
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,321
but she couldn't.

274
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:47,923
His wife's grave.

275
00:21:48,324 --> 00:21:51,393
But I remember him saying that day...

276
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,430
that there's someone he really has to meet.

277
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:56,030
Who?

278
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:57,499
- His daughter.
- His daughter?

279
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:02,638
- Is his name Yoon...
- Yes.

280
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,007
My mother said his name is Yoon Seong Joon.

281
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:10,713
The night of December 20, 2004?

282
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:12,647
Yes, that night.

283
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,850
Do you happen to remember
where you were that night?

284
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,124
The human brain doesn't
even remember yesterday.

285
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,926
How can you expect her to
remember that long ago?

286
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,329
- You should leave.
- Tell me. Where were you?

287
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:29,530
Don't you keep journals?

288
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,367
Can you try to find your journal?

289
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,339
What's this ruse now?

290
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,141
Why are you here again? And
why did you ask her that?

291
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:42,378
That's the day I went missing, you know.

292
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:44,880
What does that have to do with her?

293
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:47,915
Her father,

294
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,519
Yoon Seong Joon, must've taken my tablet.

295
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:52,854
- What?
- I retraced everywhere I've been.

296
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:55,023
Then I suddenly remembered something.

297
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,058
The man who took me to the hospital...

298
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,893
and the cell phone number he left.

299
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,461
I tracked that number.

300
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,264
It belongs to Yoon Seong Joon,

301
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:05,401
our servant's father. In other
words, another servant of ours.

302
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:14,009
What was that about?

303
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:18,714
Why does he want to know
what I did that day?

304
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,492
It answered all the questions I had.

305
00:23:30,793 --> 00:23:33,228
He must've noticed it because
it's the servants' tablet.

306
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:35,396
Divine objects aren't visible to humans,

307
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:38,167
but servants can see the servants' tablet.

308
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:40,902
He probably picked it up
thinking that it belongs to me,

309
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:43,223
and I'm sure he was going to
give it to me when I woke up.

310
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:45,339
I didn't give it to him myself,

311
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,242
so he wouldn't have been awoken.

312
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:48,677
But...

313
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,913
Why did you ask So Ah
where she was that night?

314
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:53,114
Even without him being awoken,

315
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:55,483
the tablet must've recognized the servant.

316
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:57,052
Do you get what I'm trying to say?

317
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,490
Before Yoon Seong Joon found me that night,

318
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:05,026
he met that halfie.

319
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,427
He saved him first.

320
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,862
That guy told me...

321
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,697
that Yoon Seong Joon said...

322
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,100
he wants to go meet his daughter.

323
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,370
The tablet has...

324
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:20,709
the power to grant a
servant's earnest wish.

325
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,110
Exactly!

326
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:24,312
Yoon Seong Joon's earnest wish...

327
00:24:24,313 --> 00:24:26,280
must've reached the tablet that night,

328
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:29,618
and the tablet must've
taken him to his daughter.

329
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:33,355
Now, where was she that night?

330
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:39,595
Come back and see me just once, Dad.

331
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:44,600
Then I'll forgive you for everything.

332
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:58,981
Welcome.

333
00:25:00,616 --> 00:25:03,418
Gosh, you seem much more at ease.

334
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,587
So? Why did you want to see me?

335
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:09,825
What's the tablet that
deities carry around?

336
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,961
That's actually for their servants.

337
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:14,729
It reminds them that they're...

338
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,250
descendants of the family that
has served as deities' servants.

339
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,699
It is a divine object,

340
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,270
so it's not even visible to other humans.

341
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,172
Only the descendants of
the family can see it.

342
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:25,974
Why do you ask?

343
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:27,676
The daughter.

344
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:30,645
Is his name Yoon...

345
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:33,715
Yes. My mother said his
name is Yoon Seong Joon.

346
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,961
I was right.

347
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:54,461
(Undying connection between
parents and children)

348
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:57,272
There he is.

349
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:09,284
Ha Baek.

350
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,254
I found him.

351
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:29,237
An amusement park. We've been to one.

352
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:31,707
A claw-crane game... No.

353
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:33,475
Yong Yong would be jealous.

354
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:34,943
Right?

355
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:39,380
And having street food.

356
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:41,049
Street food.

357
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:44,419
Visiting a video arcade. He would love it.

358
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:48,323
I'll also ask him to get me a flower.

359
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:51,592
Will he be okay with it?

360
00:26:51,593 --> 00:26:52,861
What if he doesn't want to?

361
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:55,463
Sharing a bowl of shaved ice.

362
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,398
Taking a nap near Han River.

363
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,067
I shouldn't forget to bring a mat.

364
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:01,703
Sharing earphones while listening to music.

365
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,707
We have so many things to do.

366
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:08,710
We should have started early.

367
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:11,880
So Ah.

368
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,583
Hey. Let's get moving.

369
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,184
We have so much to do.

370
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:19,521
By the way, you were right.

371
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:22,324
I'll look for my dad.

372
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,194
I'm not a kid anymore.

373
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,765
I'll find him and make him apologize to me.

374
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:31,833
I'll be brave.

375
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:33,802
So Ah.

376
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:37,205
- I have to go out for a moment.
- What?

377
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,708
Where are you going?

378
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:42,344
We don't have much time.

379
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:44,612
I'll be quick.

380
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:47,683
All right. I'll get dressed
while you're away.

381
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,763
I'll dress up every day.

382
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:04,066
It's important.

383
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:08,003
I should underline it.

384
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:14,242
It sounded like...

385
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,578
he had to meet someone.

386
00:28:17,412 --> 00:28:18,513
His daughter.

387
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,584
I can't ask my father's
opinion for a certain reason.

388
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,219
My mom...

389
00:28:27,189 --> 00:28:31,026
My mom is dead. So I can't
ask her opinion either.

390
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:45,140
Let me ask you a favor.

391
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:49,611
Even if you find out who Yoon
Seong Joon is, don't do anything.

392
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:53,482
That knot has to be untied by someone else.

393
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:58,487
In this life, there is
nothing prepared for you.

394
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,263
- Ms. Yoon.
- Hi.

395
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:11,032
- I'd like to meet you right now.
- Sorry?

396
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,667
It won't take long.

397
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,542
He is in there, Yoon Seong Joon.

398
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,410
So is my tablet.

399
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:26,381
You said she survived in the river.

400
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:28,784
It must have been thanks to her father.

401
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:31,586
Have you tried to look for him?

402
00:29:32,053 --> 00:29:33,121
No, I haven't.

403
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,291
What if I do and find him here in Korea?

404
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,296
If he never visited us even though
he's been here the whole time...

405
00:29:43,265 --> 00:29:44,499
Then what should I do?

406
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,668
How do you feel now?

407
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:51,439
Is that really your wish?

408
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:55,110
Meeting your dad and telling him
what you've wanted to say to him.

409
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,184
I think so.

410
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,326
I'll...

411
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:14,329
get him out.

412
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,901
What's the matter?

413
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:56,238
I think...

414
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:00,575
- this will be our last session.
- Sorry?

415
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,310
I'll tell you about the rest...

416
00:31:03,378 --> 00:31:04,479
of my past.

417
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,083
That night,

418
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,053
I chased a light.

419
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,701
Are you okay?

420
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:38,680
It's okay.

421
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:42,684
Stay still. Calm down.

422
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,353
It was the first time I felt...

423
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,489
the warmth of a human body.

424
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:50,825
It was also the first time I learned...

425
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,429
the power of someone telling you...

426
00:31:56,898 --> 00:31:58,500
it's okay.

427
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:02,237
I said I was lucky.

428
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:07,042
If he hadn't been the first
person I met that night...

429
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:12,614
If I had met someone who
couldn't tell me it was okay...

430
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,484
and hug me...

431
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,189
What would I have become?

432
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:28,797
I have met three deities so far.

433
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:33,068
That man, my stepmother, and...

434
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:36,838
you.

435
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:42,877
Would you allow me to thank
you with a handshake?

436
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:25,053
You're back.

437
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,355
I hung our portrait.

438
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:29,691
Is it raining outside?

439
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:38,833
What's wrong?

440
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:41,302
You look like you're about to cry.

441
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:45,740
What is it?

442
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:48,743
What happened?

443
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,081
Tell me.

444
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,051
Did your friends refuse
to lend you money again?

445
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,122
We don't need it.

446
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:07,162
I found...

447
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:10,131
your father.

448
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,347
I...

449
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,051
found him.

450
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:36,324
Where? Where is he right now?

451
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:40,829
Come on.

452
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,631
Where is he?

453
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,269
Under the river...

454
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,408
you jumped into that night.

455
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,779
What did you say?

456
00:35:01,082 --> 00:35:02,851
What are you talking about?

457
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:05,753
What is that supposed to mean?

458
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:09,324
He came back...

459
00:35:11,126 --> 00:35:13,495
to Korea that day.

460
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:17,165
On his way to your mother's grave,

461
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:20,468
he picked up Joo Dong's tablet.

462
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:22,537
The servants' tablet...

463
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:27,408
has a power to realize servants' wishes.

464
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:31,980
Your father's wish that night...

465
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:35,416
must have been to meet you.

466
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:51,499
That night,

467
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,737
right before you jumped into the river,

468
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,875
the power of the tablet...

469
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,978
led him there.

470
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:07,615
No.

471
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,252
He must have...

472
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:14,956
seen you jumping into the water.

473
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,426
No...

474
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,528
No...

475
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:23,198
No...

476
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,271
(Undying connection between
parents and children)

477
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:48,323
So Ah.

478
00:36:49,257 --> 00:36:50,325
So Ah.

479
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,761
So Ah! No!

480
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:56,030
So Ah!

481
00:36:56,664 --> 00:37:03,004
(Undying connection between
parents and children)

482
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:43,998
My dad...

483
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:50,037
can't swim.

484
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:56,544
He can't swim at all.

485
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,621
Why...

486
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:09,223
Why?

487
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:12,326
Why does he have to do this to me?

488
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:15,196
Dad...

489
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:19,400
Dad, Dad...

490
00:40:21,102 --> 00:40:24,305
Dad, come out of there, please.

491
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,108
Dad.

492
00:40:37,084 --> 00:40:38,953
Please save my dad.

493
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:42,490
This doesn't make any sense.

494
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,891
My dad...

495
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:47,628
My dad can't die like this.

496
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,268
Ha Baek.

497
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:56,771
Please save my dad.

498
00:40:58,072 --> 00:40:59,474
You're a deity.

499
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,211
Save my dad's life, please.

500
00:41:05,646 --> 00:41:07,114
I can't...

501
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:11,319
make the dead come back to life.

502
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:14,522
I had no idea.

503
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:19,293
I thought I got out of the water on my own.

504
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,098
I feel so horrible for my dad.

505
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:29,637
My dad... Because of me...

506
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:32,373
- No.
- It's all my fault.

507
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,677
It happened because of me. I...

508
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:40,581
- I killed my dad. I did it.
- That's not true.

509
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:45,219
I killed him! After doing that,

510
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,056
I spent all those years...

511
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,993
resenting and hating him.

512
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:55,129
I killed my dad. It was my doing!

513
00:41:58,332 --> 00:41:59,433
No.

514
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,538
That's why he's not coming out.

515
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:07,475
He doesn't want to see me.

516
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:10,578
No. That's not true, So Ah.

517
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,880
No.

518
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,818
I should go there.

519
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:20,021
Dad must be waiting for me.

520
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:22,557
I'll go bring him.

521
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,558
- No.
- Let go!

522
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:26,193
I can do it.

523
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:28,629
I used to be a good swimmer.

524
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,263
My dad knows that.

525
00:42:30,264 --> 00:42:33,366
That's why he's waiting for me.
Please. Please...

526
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:35,703
- No, you can't go.
- Let go of me.

527
00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:41,842
No. No, I can't let you do that. Please.

528
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:03,563
The body doesn't move?

529
00:43:03,564 --> 00:43:06,801
Ha Baek tried his best,
but it didn't even budge.

530
00:43:06,968 --> 00:43:08,234
Because of the tablet,

531
00:43:08,235 --> 00:43:10,103
the body is kept intact though.

532
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:13,007
He just left the tablet there as
removing it might ruin the body.

533
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:16,142
What's Ms. Descendant going to do now?

534
00:43:16,143 --> 00:43:17,510
Why wouldn't it budge?

535
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,948
That's... Nobody knows.

536
00:44:08,195 --> 00:44:10,297
Well, what do you think a deity is?

537
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:15,202
A superior being that grants
humans' earnest wishes.

538
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,775
That's what a true deity is.

539
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:25,613
You said...

540
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:29,850
your wish was to meet your
father and tell him everything.

541
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:33,421
I'm sorry I never got to realize your wish.

542
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,692
I'm a deity.

543
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:43,731
I'm sorry I couldn't even
do that much as a deity.

544
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:31,472
Excuse me, Lord Ha Baek.

545
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,519
- How's So Ah?
- She's not doing well.

546
00:46:46,453 --> 00:46:48,155
Moo Ra and I also went inside.

547
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:49,869
We couldn't take him out either.

548
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,525
Then what should we do?

549
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:54,962
Ms. Descendant has been waiting for
her father for such a long time.

550
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,530
She says...

551
00:46:57,932 --> 00:46:59,400
she'll go inside herself.

552
00:47:02,203 --> 00:47:05,572
It's too deep for her. She can't go.

553
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,106
But it's not like we can
just leave him there either.

554
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:08,209
Why not?

555
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:15,049
Just stay still and don't do anything.

556
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:17,718
- Just like the before.
- Moo Ra.

557
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:20,554
Do you think I don't know
what you're trying to do?

558
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:22,356
I'm Moo Ra.

559
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:26,360
I've been able to read your
mind for the past 2,800 years.

560
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:30,965
I even know how you feel by
just listening to your sigh.

561
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:33,400
- Moo Ra.
- What are you saying?

562
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:36,837
I know that you've decided
to use the power you need...

563
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:40,174
to return to our realm...

564
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:42,343
on her.

565
00:47:45,312 --> 00:47:46,780
- Is she right?
- Lord Ha Baek.

566
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:50,984
You... You can't do that.

567
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:54,188
If you fail to go back, you'll
fail to become the king.

568
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:57,524
If you fail to become the king...

569
00:47:58,158 --> 00:47:59,727
If that happens...

570
00:48:00,194 --> 00:48:01,362
You'll die.

571
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:04,865
You already know that.

572
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,939
I can't forgive you for even thinking that.
I won't allow it.

573
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,007
You can't do that, Ha Baek.

574
00:48:14,008 --> 00:48:16,408
- Don't do that, Lord Ha Baek.
- You can't do that, Ha Baek.

575
00:48:27,021 --> 00:48:28,521
I need to keep my promise.

576
00:48:28,522 --> 00:48:29,857
Stop with the nonsense.

577
00:48:29,957 --> 00:48:32,126
How is anything more
important than your death?

578
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:34,762
She said it's the deity's
duty to protect humans.

579
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,403
How can I call myself a king...

580
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:48,942
if I can't even protect that woman?

581
00:48:48,943 --> 00:48:50,110
Stop with that rubbish.

582
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,379
Do you think she'd really want that?

583
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,861
If you die, you'll disappear
from the memories of humans.

584
00:48:56,317 --> 00:48:58,352
She won't be able to remember you at all.

585
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:00,888
She'll forget all about your existence.

586
00:49:10,965 --> 00:49:14,068
What... What does this all mean?

587
00:49:40,961 --> 00:49:42,963
- Listen to me.
- No.

588
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:44,832
I don't want to listen to anything.

589
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:48,002
Please don't say anything.

590
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:50,871
How...

591
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,009
How could you think about
doing such a thing?

592
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:57,911
How could you think about doing
such a cruel thing to me?

593
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,115
You're going to die?

594
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:06,153
You're going to disappear from my memory?

595
00:50:08,022 --> 00:50:10,290
I'm going to forget about you
for the rest of my life?

596
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,894
How can you...

597
00:50:16,463 --> 00:50:18,232
- Listen to me.
- No...

598
00:50:22,803 --> 00:50:24,438
It's because I did nothing for you.

599
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:27,341
I'm your deity.

600
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:29,809
You said deities are supposed to fulfill...

601
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:31,812
the desperate wishes of humans.

602
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,083
So please give me a chance.

603
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,019
I never said anything like that.

604
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,924
I don't have any wishes.

605
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:50,264
And...

606
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:53,934
I promised that I'll protect you.

607
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:58,605
I never asked you to
sacrifice your life for me.

608
00:51:00,841 --> 00:51:03,143
Why are you so selfish?

609
00:51:15,255 --> 00:51:16,457
What should we do?

610
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:19,193
What should we do? Let's
just send him back.

611
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,039
Isn't there a way to force him to go back?

612
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,430
Then what should we do?

613
00:51:24,731 --> 00:51:26,300
He really might do it.

614
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:29,937
Let's lock him up. Yes, let's do that.

615
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:32,772
No, we can't force anything to a king.

616
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:34,808
Then use your power on her.

617
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:36,509
You can protect her. You
said you guys are friends.

618
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,711
You already know that I can't.

619
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:39,947
It's something that's way beyond...

620
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,614
the three of our powers.

621
00:51:41,615 --> 00:51:43,117
Then what do you suggest we do?

622
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:46,385
It's all your fault.

623
00:51:46,386 --> 00:51:48,021
Why did you have to look into the past?

624
00:51:48,755 --> 00:51:51,692
If Ha Baek dies, I'm going to kill you too.

625
00:52:05,506 --> 00:52:07,607
I heard Moo Ra told you
that Ha Baek is nothing...

626
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:09,910
if he doesn't become the king.

627
00:52:12,913 --> 00:52:14,581
Ha Baek was born to become the king...

628
00:52:14,982 --> 00:52:16,702
because that's the reason of his existence.

629
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:19,629
If he doesn't become the king,
there's no reason for him to exist.

630
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:21,855
That naturally means that he'll die.

631
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:24,258
That's the law of nature.

632
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,095
That's also why humans fail to remember...

633
00:52:28,695 --> 00:52:31,031
all the deities that had
existed in the past.

634
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,334
So please do this for Ha Baek.

635
00:52:35,836 --> 00:52:37,037
Tell him that...

636
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:41,253
you're willing to just
leave your father there.

637
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:43,989
Tell him that you're not
going to look for him.

638
00:52:45,979 --> 00:52:49,516
That's the only way you'll both live.

639
00:53:00,194 --> 00:53:04,798
Lord Bi Ryeom told me that Ms.
Descendant decided to give up.

640
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:40,167
So Ah.

641
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:54,448
You're right.

642
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:58,452
I only thought about myself
because I was scared to lose you.

643
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:03,257
I promised to help you live
with the memory you have of me.

644
00:54:05,726 --> 00:54:07,361
But I had forgotten about that.

645
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,098
So...

646
00:54:12,766 --> 00:54:14,735
please promise me one thing.

647
00:54:16,937 --> 00:54:18,272
Promise me that...

648
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,341
you'll cherish your life.

649
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,981
Promise me that you'll do that...

650
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,451
even after I leave.

651
00:54:35,389 --> 00:54:39,793
Your father will be at peace there.

652
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:44,364
I'll always look after him.

653
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,801
Don't forget that...

654
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:51,238
I'm the Deity of Water...

655
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:54,308
and the king of the Land of Water.

656
00:55:11,591 --> 00:55:12,726
Let's go see...

657
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:15,362
your father.

658
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:29,843
I'm sorry,

659
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:32,713
Dad.

660
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,285
I'm sorry.

661
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:46,560
I'm sorry, Dad.

662
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:52,265
What?

663
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,081
Where did he go?

664
00:56:09,216 --> 00:56:10,684
Why is it so quiet?

665
00:56:18,692 --> 00:56:20,260
Don't worry.

666
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,735
You're the one who should
leave without any worries.

667
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,205
That was our initial plan anyway.

668
00:56:33,273 --> 00:56:35,241
Let's keep doing what we had planned to do.

669
00:56:35,242 --> 00:56:36,710
Where should we go first?

670
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:54,995
I love you.

671
00:57:42,742 --> 00:57:44,144
What was that?

672
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,513
I give you my grace.

673
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,615
No, stop.

674
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:51,051
Therefore, you shall live no matter what.

675
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,522
You shall never be unhappy.

676
00:57:57,123 --> 00:57:59,626
And you shall live a full life.

677
00:58:00,827 --> 00:58:01,928
No!

678
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,198
Therefore,

679
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,371
I want you to meet someone you love,

680
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,177
and live your remaining life in happiness.

681
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:19,846
Happiness.

682
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:24,117
That's what you've always wanted the most.

683
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:27,821
No, you can't do this.

684
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,759
Is this what you had in mind?

685
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:35,694
Did you fool me from the beginning?

686
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:37,464
Is that why you brought me here?

687
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,272
I can't just leave you
without doing anything.

688
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,604
I know that you're going
to go to your father...

689
00:58:45,205 --> 00:58:47,007
after I leave.

690
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,676
How can I leave when I already know that?

691
00:58:51,044 --> 00:58:54,414
I can do it. I can take him out.

692
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,783
What is this? How can you...

693
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,819
How can you be so foolish?

694
00:59:00,153 --> 00:59:01,454
How?

695
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:04,224
What am I going to do now?

696
00:59:04,524 --> 00:59:06,359
This is what you have to do.

697
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:08,228
Get ahold of yourself,

698
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,198
and go meet your father right now.

699
00:59:12,999 --> 00:59:14,834
No, I don't want to.

700
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:16,937
Hurry up.

701
00:59:17,604 --> 00:59:19,205
Your father's waiting for you.

702
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:22,475
Hurry.

703
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:25,512
So Ah.

704
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,281
Go.

705
00:59:30,216 --> 00:59:31,651
Let me do something I can...

706
00:59:33,954 --> 00:59:35,956
while I'm still here.

707
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:52,138
No way.

708
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,906
I can't believe this.

709
00:59:53,907 --> 00:59:56,041
Ha Baek, how can you do this to us?

710
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:57,177
Ha Baek.

711
01:00:02,983 --> 01:00:04,184
Go.

712
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:07,554
- Your father's waiting for you.
- Ha Baek.

713
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,858
Let him do what he's going to do.

714
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,496
I can't believe this.

715
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,603
Go.

716
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:26,840
Your father's waiting for you.

717
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:44,851
Dad.

718
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:01,234
Dad.

719
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:04,003
Dad.

720
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,876
Why are you here all alone?

721
01:02:11,377 --> 01:02:13,279
You must've been so scared.

722
01:02:14,881 --> 01:02:16,583
You must've been so lonely...

723
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:18,918
and cold.

724
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,523
Why didn't you call me earlier?

725
01:02:38,538 --> 01:02:42,175
Let's go home now, Dad.

726
01:02:44,711 --> 01:02:46,012
Let's go home.

727
01:03:24,984 --> 01:03:26,953
(Undying connection between
parents and children)

728
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,153
(Yoon Seong Joon)

729
01:04:04,524 --> 01:04:06,359
Just wait a little bit, Dad.

730
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,163
I'll soon bring Mom here too.

731
01:04:52,205 --> 01:04:53,439
I'm not...

732
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:57,043
going to forgive you.

733
01:04:58,077 --> 01:04:59,178
Okay.

734
01:05:00,046 --> 01:05:01,447
I'm going to hate you...

735
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:04,250
and resent you.

736
01:05:07,253 --> 01:05:08,354
Okay.

737
01:05:10,456 --> 01:05:11,958
I'm going to regret...

738
01:05:15,762 --> 01:05:17,263
meeting you.

739
01:05:19,465 --> 01:05:20,566
Okay.

740
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,645
I'm going to put things back to normal...

741
01:05:30,944 --> 01:05:32,578
before any of that happens.

742
01:05:44,991 --> 01:05:46,092
I'm going to...

743
01:05:48,261 --> 01:05:50,263
put things back to where
they were no matter what.

744
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:52,699
What are you saying?

745
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:57,503
I thought she was stupid.

746
01:05:58,604 --> 01:06:00,604
But I guess she was smart
enough to think of this.

747
01:06:04,644 --> 01:06:07,880
But I'm not going to forgive you
just because you thought of this.

748
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:09,215
What's going on?

749
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:11,584
Ms. Descendant has come up with a solution.

750
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,721
She's going to use my tablet that was
inside Yoon Seong Joon's pocket.

751
01:06:16,356 --> 01:06:17,757
I heard that...

752
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:21,260
the servant's tablet fulfills
a servant's earnest wish.

753
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:26,265
I'm going to help you return.

754
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,468
- So Ah.
- Make it quick.

755
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:31,404
I'm desperate to kill you both, but
I'm trying hard to hold it in.

756
01:06:32,271 --> 01:06:35,174
Hurry up. Moo Ra might cause a flood soon.

757
01:06:46,452 --> 01:06:47,587
Your hand, please.

758
01:07:02,402 --> 01:07:03,503
Now,

759
01:07:04,804 --> 01:07:07,907
everything will go back to normal.

760
01:07:16,149 --> 01:07:19,185
- With the deity's grace...
- So this is where you were.

761
01:07:22,522 --> 01:07:23,990
What?

762
01:07:24,824 --> 01:07:25,992
Is that the High Priest?

763
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:30,495
What are you doing here?

764
01:07:30,496 --> 01:07:33,366
I come here often.

765
01:07:33,566 --> 01:07:35,401
Didn't Joo Dong tell you?

766
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:37,670
What? Oh, I completely forgot.

767
01:07:39,372 --> 01:07:41,874
I came to catch a servant...

768
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:45,578
that secretly ran away
after causing trouble.

769
01:07:47,113 --> 01:07:48,815
I also had a few people to meet here.

770
01:07:52,051 --> 01:07:56,789
You must be the one who got
to live longer by meeting...

771
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:58,924
a competent taxi driver.

772
01:07:58,925 --> 01:08:00,026
Sorry?

773
01:08:02,528 --> 01:08:03,929
By any chance...

774
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:05,832
I heard you did a part-time
job, Lord Ha Baek.

775
01:08:06,232 --> 01:08:08,701
You didn't have any parents to
give any red long johns to.

776
01:08:09,202 --> 01:08:14,474
So I wonder what you did
with your first paycheck.

777
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:16,843
High Priest, were you...

778
01:08:17,643 --> 01:08:20,313
What are you doing? Why
are you disturbing us?

779
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,381
- Hurry up.
- With the deity's grace...

780
01:08:23,382 --> 01:08:24,483
What are you doing?

781
01:08:24,484 --> 01:08:26,018
My gosh.

782
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,855
Listen to me carefully. I'm
not going to repeat myself.

783
01:08:29,755 --> 01:08:33,358
This fool used his remaining
power on this woman,

784
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,559
so he's having trouble going back.

785
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,795
Wait a second.

786
01:08:36,295 --> 01:08:38,998
So you're going to use
that tablet's power...

787
01:08:39,098 --> 01:08:41,134
on just helping Lord Ha Baek return?

788
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:44,270
Why would you waste that precious
power on such a useless thing?

789
01:08:44,971 --> 01:08:47,073
What do you mean, High Priest?

790
01:08:47,406 --> 01:08:48,974
If he fails to go back, he'll die.

791
01:08:48,975 --> 01:08:50,243
Why would he fail to go back?

792
01:08:50,676 --> 01:08:53,645
Lord Ha Baek has completed his mission.

793
01:08:53,646 --> 01:08:56,314
That means he'll be able to return.

794
01:08:56,315 --> 01:08:57,683
That's why he's a fool.

795
01:08:58,317 --> 01:09:01,020
He could've just stayed there
when he first returned.

796
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,322
Wait.

797
01:09:08,494 --> 01:09:10,229
My new mission was to find out...

798
01:09:12,265 --> 01:09:15,034
the reason behind hiding the
sacred stone in the human world.

799
01:09:16,536 --> 01:09:17,703
Oh, right.

800
01:09:18,504 --> 01:09:21,741
That's correct. From what I know,
you've already found that reason.

801
01:09:33,853 --> 01:09:35,054
How can...

802
01:09:37,657 --> 01:09:39,759
a deity save the world...

803
01:09:43,129 --> 01:09:45,264
if he or she can't even
save just one human being?

804
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:47,999
What... What was that?

805
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,435
I knew this would happen.

806
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:53,339
The universe favors Ha Baek so much.

807
01:09:54,674 --> 01:09:55,908
Ms. Yoon.

808
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:00,413
I advise you to use the tablet's
power on something more valuable.

809
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:04,750
I have a guest coming over,
so I have to go now.

810
01:10:05,484 --> 01:10:09,522
Lord Ha Baek, don't forget that you
still must return to Land of Water.

811
01:10:14,193 --> 01:10:16,963
Yes, he's right.

812
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:19,665
Let's continue with what we were doing.

813
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,868
Make the best wish...

814
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:25,805
so that I can leave you at ease.

815
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,809
Ask for more money than Mansour.

816
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:37,149
With the deity's grace,
you shall be awakened.

817
01:10:42,888 --> 01:10:45,591
You are the last descendant of the
family of servants for deities.

818
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:48,194
And you shall now speak of
your most earnest wish.

819
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:52,632
Don't hesitate. Just say it.

820
01:10:53,432 --> 01:10:56,969
This is your chance to become
happy for the rest of your life.

821
01:11:04,543 --> 01:11:05,845
My wish is...

822
01:11:08,281 --> 01:11:11,951
My wish is...

823
01:11:14,887 --> 01:11:15,988
I...

824
01:11:23,062 --> 01:11:24,263
I wish that...

825
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:29,702
you'd...

826
01:11:34,006 --> 01:11:35,574
leave a little later.

827
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,615
Please stay by my side...

828
01:11:46,185 --> 01:11:47,687
until I die.

829
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,660
Please live with me until then.

830
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,364
You can go back...

831
01:11:59,332 --> 01:12:01,834
and become a good king after I die.

832
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,508
Let's live together.

833
01:12:23,322 --> 01:12:26,225
I'm going to go now. I'm getting too angry.
I should leave.

834
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,394
You had the chance to
become richer than Mansour.

835
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,072
It must be because you're young.

836
01:12:55,988 --> 01:12:57,156
I love you.

837
01:12:58,224 --> 01:12:59,392
I love you.

838
01:13:09,502 --> 01:13:13,338
You did a good deed, so you'll
be fine in your next life.

839
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:14,473
I didn't do anything.

840
01:13:15,174 --> 01:13:17,694
Ms. Yoon came to me and asked me
about the power of the tablet.

841
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,644
I only told her what I knew.

842
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,815
You took your risk and revealed
to her the secrets of nature.

843
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,585
I heard that's your strongest skill.

844
01:13:27,853 --> 01:13:29,755
Gosh, I've only just met you.

845
01:13:31,257 --> 01:13:34,393
Nice to meet you. I am High Priest.

846
01:13:35,561 --> 01:13:36,628
My name is Shin Hu Ye.

847
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:38,363
I used to be the Deity of Fire.

848
01:13:38,364 --> 01:13:42,968
Can you teach me how to use fire?

849
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:48,073
If I master that, I'll
be able to control...

850
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,943
water, fire, air, earth, and humans.

851
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:52,978
You should come see me soon.

852
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:08,861
Lord Ha Baek, let's go now.

853
01:14:11,964 --> 01:14:13,466
That sly old man.

854
01:14:14,433 --> 01:14:15,801
He knew everything all along.

855
01:14:19,805 --> 01:14:21,507
I still need to return to Land of Water.

856
01:14:22,007 --> 01:14:25,578
I'll go there to make sure
your wish will come true.

857
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,113
You'll be back, right?

858
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:30,115
I promise I'll be back.

859
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,017
You won't take long, right?

860
01:14:33,452 --> 01:14:34,553
No.

861
01:14:43,095 --> 01:14:44,363
See you soon.

862
01:15:22,468 --> 01:15:24,236
I organized them into categories.

863
01:15:24,403 --> 01:15:27,239
There's no need for that.
I've figured out...

864
01:15:27,907 --> 01:15:29,375
how to become a better person.

865
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:37,983
As you know, I used to get
such good grades in school.

866
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:41,654
I'm saying I've finally figured out
what you've been trying to tell me.

867
01:15:43,822 --> 01:15:45,023
So what is it?

868
01:15:45,024 --> 01:15:47,660
How will you become a better person?

869
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:49,994
Go through this.

870
01:15:49,995 --> 01:15:52,635
It's a proposal. I'll pester Grandpa
to start this new foundation.

871
01:15:53,532 --> 01:15:55,301
This one is for single moms.

872
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,236
This is for the elderly who live alone,

873
01:15:57,369 --> 01:15:59,009
and this is for children without parents.

874
01:15:59,338 --> 01:16:00,772
Noblesse oblige.

875
01:16:00,773 --> 01:16:02,775
That's how I'll become a better person.

876
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,381
It's not a bad idea,

877
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:11,717
but you should do this first.

878
01:16:12,351 --> 01:16:14,319
Please write down names
of the people here...

879
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,120
and get them to sign before
you do anything else.

880
01:16:16,121 --> 01:16:18,023
"I'm sorry." That's what
you should start with.

881
01:16:19,058 --> 01:16:21,894
- What people?
- Those whom you owe an apology.

882
01:16:22,294 --> 01:16:24,573
List all of them here, apologize
to them, and get their signatures.

883
01:16:24,597 --> 01:16:25,630
Start with your grandfather.

884
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:27,566
Then I'll preach at you again.

885
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,669
- What?
- When you become a better person,

886
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:33,038
- I might become your friend.
- What?

887
01:16:38,611 --> 01:16:40,571
(Undying connection between
parents and children)

888
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:21,920
No, no. Don't even think about it.

889
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,555
Even if you jump in there,

890
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,658
Ha Baek won't be able to
show up and save you.

891
01:17:26,659 --> 01:17:28,527
That's not what I was thinking.

892
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,365
Your dad is in the forest. Why
are you looking all sad here?

893
01:17:33,766 --> 01:17:35,400
And don't throw things
like that in the river.

894
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:36,902
You'll pollute the water.

895
01:17:37,936 --> 01:17:39,672
I have news for you.

896
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,208
Ha Baek won't be able to come back.

897
01:17:43,976 --> 01:17:45,344
What do you mean?

898
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:47,913
Did a messenger come?

899
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:49,681
A messenger isn't necessary.

900
01:17:49,682 --> 01:17:51,016
I'm a deity.

901
01:17:51,316 --> 01:17:52,851
That's the feeling I'm getting.

902
01:17:54,353 --> 01:17:55,454
Let's go.

903
01:18:00,059 --> 01:18:02,699
We haven't heard a word from him.
That means he's not coming back.

904
01:18:02,728 --> 01:18:05,597
Stop worrying. Let's
just mind our business.

905
01:18:05,864 --> 01:18:07,633
You really didn't like any of the rings?

906
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:10,536
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

907
01:18:16,141 --> 01:18:17,241
Do you want to tell me something?

908
01:18:17,242 --> 01:18:20,813
I've been meaning to tell you this.

909
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,314
Well...

910
01:18:23,549 --> 01:18:25,183
I think I should marry Hyung Sik.

911
01:18:25,184 --> 01:18:27,285
- What?
- We should just get married.

912
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,987
Love isn't about anything special.

913
01:18:29,354 --> 01:18:31,674
It makes you want to care and
look after the one you love.

914
01:18:31,857 --> 01:18:34,026
For me, that's enough.

915
01:18:35,227 --> 01:18:38,229
Hey, try to think rationally.

916
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:40,131
You can't marry your friend.

917
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,001
We've known for a long time,
so we know each other's flaws.

918
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,036
Do you dislike Hyung Sik?

919
01:18:45,037 --> 01:18:46,370
No, that's not what I'm saying.

920
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:47,638
- Hyung Sik is here...
- What?

921
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:50,409
- To meet you in person.
- Hey, wait. Hey!

922
01:18:50,676 --> 01:18:52,478
- Hey, wait!
- Hyung Sik.

923
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,855
It's been a long time, So Ah.

924
01:19:03,856 --> 01:19:05,758
Yes, it's been a long time indeed.

925
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:08,059
Why have you never come by?

926
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:10,763
Because you scare me.

927
01:19:13,599 --> 01:19:15,234
What did I do?

928
01:19:16,769 --> 01:19:18,603
Sang Yu is getting married?

929
01:19:18,604 --> 01:19:21,707
Yes. He doesn't even
have anything saved up.

930
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:23,241
I wanted to give him...

931
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:26,003
enough money for rent deposit as a
wedding gift when he gets married.

932
01:19:26,311 --> 01:19:27,546
This is too sudden.

933
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,360
Gosh, I told him not to rush it,
but he's not listening to me.

934
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:33,117
He just keeps saying...

935
01:19:33,118 --> 01:19:35,597
that people used to get married with
nothing but two spoons and a pot.

936
01:19:35,621 --> 01:19:37,623
Things are so different nowadays, you know.

937
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:46,932
Hello? Did she hang up on me again?
Goodness.

938
01:20:24,937 --> 01:20:26,572
- I'm back.
- Yes.

939
01:20:27,306 --> 01:20:29,373
I told you not to stay out late.
You never listen to me.

940
01:20:29,374 --> 01:20:30,775
What took you so long?

941
01:20:30,776 --> 01:20:33,879
The process for deferring the
enthronement was so complicated.

942
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:36,315
They're so inflexible.

943
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:00,973
Let's go eat something.

944
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:02,674
Okay.

945
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:19,191
- Will you keep feeling hunger?
- Yes.

946
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:21,460
What about the magic wand?

947
01:21:22,694 --> 01:21:23,896
They said I can't take it.

948
01:21:24,062 --> 01:21:26,465
Then... Did you bring nothing
but a driver's license again?

949
01:21:26,765 --> 01:21:27,832
They told me to get it here.

950
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:29,834
Gosh, you have a lot to do.

951
01:21:29,835 --> 01:21:31,236
Where's Mr. Nam?

952
01:21:31,503 --> 01:21:32,970
He's sick of the part-time jobs...

953
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,939
and scared of your friend,
so he didn't come.

954
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:37,409
(Ha Baek, Yoon So Ah)

955
01:21:56,028 --> 01:21:57,429
Nothing has changed, right?

956
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:08,807
(Thank you for watching
The Bride of Habaek.)

957
01:22:12,044 --> 01:22:15,213
People can survive anything...

958
01:22:15,547 --> 01:22:17,950
with the strength they have.

959
01:22:18,583 --> 01:22:21,085
But life would be better with love.

960
01:22:21,086 --> 01:22:23,255
