1
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:42,334
In 1862, the first
trans-continental railroad

2
00:00:42,384 --> 00:00:47,005
triggered a rush of
white settlers heading West.

3
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,211
They all rushed into the land
that once belonged to the indians.

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,501
It was at this time that Ranger,
a white Southerner,

5
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,709
rescued Abahachi,
chief of the Apache,

6
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:03,919
at an unguarded rail road crossing.
Apache customs demanded

7
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:08,125
they become blood brothers.
They had no choice.

8
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:12,830
Abahachi and Ranger did
what tradition called for.

9
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:34,909
Ouch! You crazy?

10
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,706
Slow down, turn ahead!

11
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:30,649
Shut up! I drive this route every day!

12
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,166
Dull arrow.

13
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:53,884
Pointy arrow!

14
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:13,849
Strangers!

15
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:40,233
Abahachi's face shows
pain and grief.

16
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:44,439
Dark clouds gather over the land
where the Shoshone live.

17
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:48,647
Abahachi and his white brother
Ranger bid their "Hugh"

18
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:50,747
to Merry Mole, chief of the Shoshone.

19
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,904
Mighty.

20
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:54,435
What?

21
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:56,027
His name is Mighty Mole.

22
00:04:56,112 --> 00:05:00,983
Abahachi brings the chief's dead son.
Abahachi is a murderer!

23
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:03,056
Just a sec, big misundertanding!

24
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,189
Yes, very big indeed!

25
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,108
Aweng konakate!

26
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:27,894
Hey, what's that on your arm?
Is that a dog?

27
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:31,551
What?

28
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:32,724
Ugh...

29
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:34,269
Well...

30
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:36,326
Where is my gold?

31
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,442
Just let him finish, asshole!

32
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:39,389
Hush, are you're crazy?

33
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:40,401
Should he let you finish or not?

34
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,775
Ok. The story was like this:
We had an appointment

35
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:45,775
Ok. The story was like this:
We had an appointment

36
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:50,775
with a realtor from Wyoming.
I had seen his ad in the paper,

37
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:54,231
and I quote:
"Quiet saloon in mint condition,

38
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,395
and I quote:
"Quiet saloon in mint condition,

39
00:05:55,441 --> 00:06:00,596
no transfer fee, available immediately".
The new pub for my tribe!

40
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,804
His employees looked
respectable to us!

41
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:10,394
I didn't want to miss such a bargain
and borrowed your gold.

42
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,063
Indians!

43
00:06:12,107 --> 00:06:14,689
Hiya!

44
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:41,725
Right on time, as the Shoshone always are,
your son Rabid Rabbit

45
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,262
brought the Shoshone credit.
Everybody liked each other.

46
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:47,858
Whazup, wimp?

47
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:52,091
May I introduce:
Rabid rabbit, Santa Maria; Santa Maria,

48
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:56,304
Ranger, Ranger, Santa Maria, Rabit,
son of the chief of the Shoshone.

49
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:58,362
See, see, Shoshone!

50
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,477
The deal was closed!

51
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,849
I was the proudest Indian in the whole world!

52
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:08,394
Term: 15 years, interest rate 33%.

53
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,315
Yes, exactly!

54
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:11,926
What did he just say?

55
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:15,511
Not sure, he has a strong dialect.

56
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:16,250
Abahachi?

57
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:19,300
Yes! Oh!

58
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,503
One bottle of firewater for free!

59
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:25,794
Congratulations to your new saloon.

60
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:28,008
This is on the house!

61
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:32,421
I baptize you to be called...
Uh...

62
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:35,389
Apache pub.
- Apache pub.

63
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:47,630
Well, I'd complain about that.

64
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,214
Feels comfortable in the hand!

65
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:03,082
Congrats! Great door!

66
00:08:03,186 --> 00:08:05,295
You're never happy!
Always complaining!

67
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:13,795
BBQ nights, hanging out together,
indian classes in your own saloon!

68
00:08:13,846 --> 00:08:17,044
I never mentioned classes!

69
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:23,503
End. Done!
Hand me the white flag!

70
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:27,712
How am I supposed to get
a white flag here?

71
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,133
Every indian always carries one,
just you don't!

72
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:36,835
Then it became quiet, too quiet.
The realtor from Wyoming

73
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:41,922
and his employees had left.
Just your son lay in the grass.

74
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,442
I was wondering how he could
sleep with all that noise.

75
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,331
They are gone!

76
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:48,540
I don't think he cares.

77
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:50,131
Why?

78
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:52,290
He is...

79
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,837
We paid last honors
to Rabid Rabbit.

80
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:06,958
Is there anything
you can actually pull off?

81
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,708
Truth is: the man who cheated my
tribe out of its new saloon

82
00:09:12,756 --> 00:09:16,466
is also the murderer of your son.
And on top of that,

83
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:17,756
is also the murderer of your son.
And on top of that,

84
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,706
he also stole your gold!

85
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,758
What is the name of that man?

86
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:23,757
Santa Maria!

87
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:25,422
You stole the gold from the Shoshone!
You killed my son!

88
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:27,791
You stole the gold from the Shoshone!
You killed my son!

89
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:32,164
And now you bad mouth
the firends of my tribe!

90
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,408
How right you are, Mighty Mole!

91
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,539
Unbelievable!

92
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,615
These are the murderers
of your son!

93
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,747
No! Don't believe him!

94
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,972
Santa Maria speaks with
a twisted tongue!

95
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:45,253
When the sun has been
victorious over the moon

96
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:49,754
the Shoshone will send
Abahachi and his white brother

97
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:54,161
to the happy hunting grounds.
Mighty Mole has spoken!

98
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:56,304
Mighty mighty!

99
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,500
An Apache in a pickle.

100
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:02,702
Abahachi? Ranger?
Hombre? I'll clock off.

101
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:07,078
Do me a favor and keep an eye
on these two tonight.

102
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,404
We want to see them die tomorrow!

103
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,784
Allright, boss!

104
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,699
Err...

105
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:21,751
What is it?

106
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,698
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:27,752
Why? Everything is just fine!

108
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,862
We both have our own poles.

109
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:32,076
And tomorrow we won't
be having any more trouble.

110
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,134
Don't be such a sourpuss.

111
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:35,935
I'm fed up to the back teeth!

112
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:38,318
Always the same crap
for the last 16 years!

113
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:40,450
Tied to some pole
every other day!

114
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:44,658
Keep it down, it's not their business!
What's wrong with you lately?

115
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,285
I am just not happy with the
overall situation!

116
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,361
Why not?

117
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,264
What do we do all day long?

118
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:57,575
Sneaking up with no purpose,
reading tracks for hours,

119
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,067
and riding side by side
with no point.

120
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:01,782
You call that riding?

121
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:03,857
What's wrong with my way of riding?

122
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,990
It's not riding,
it's animal cruelty!

123
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:07,545
Bite me!

124
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,155
How?!

125
00:11:22,038 --> 00:11:24,111
Sht.

126
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:28,735
Sst!

127
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,694
Abahachi!

128
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:53,570
Quiet outside!
Or I'll call the cops!

129
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,486
I got a bunch of appointments
and you idiots won't let me sleep!

130
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:00,175
Turn the lighd off!

131
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:05,019
You spell light with a "T"!

132
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:30,199
Did you hear that? A man got
a rock in his private parts.

133
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,651
A new family jewel.
Look, the guard's asleep.

134
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:35,685
What did you say?

135
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,527
The guard's asleep.

136
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:39,808
No, about the jewel.

137
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:41,940
Just a bad pun.

138
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:46,858
That's no pun, that's the solution!
I got one! I had totally forgotten about it.

139
00:12:46,905 --> 00:12:49,429
My jewel! A really big treasure!

140
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,059
Now you come up with a treasure!

141
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:54,347
That doesn't help us anymore.

142
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,686
It does. We can use it to pay
our debt with the Shoshone.

143
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,897
We're still charged with murder.

144
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,105
We need to prove that Santa Maria is the
real murderer of Rabid Rabbit.

145
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:11,186
Right. Also, on top of that
I only have a part of the treasure map.

146
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:15,478
Well, sometimes I think you do
this on purpose!

147
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:20,732
When I was a little indian,
my grandpa Gray Star

148
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:25,932
took me hunting. He always stressed
how important it is to divide up the loot.

149
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:29,978
I divided everything!
18 by 9! 13 by 7! 16 by 5! 17 by 8!

150
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:36,103
Grandpa sometimes called me the
Smallest Common Divisor.

151
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:39,930
Many summers passed.
On his deathbed

152
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:42,117
he gave me a treasure map.

153
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,356
And you divided it.

154
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,280
Yes, by four!

155
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,264
Who has the other three parts?

156
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:52,601
I don't know, I was drunk.
Well, that is...

157
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:57,056
I do remember one.
Well, thanks heavens...

158
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,891
Hey, who was that?
Who cares, let's go!

159
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:17,730
Well done, Hombre!
I am almost proud of you!

160
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,729
Follow them without attracting attention.
I'll stay here with Jim and John.

161
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:25,313
Chief Molehill must
not get suspicious.

162
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,184
We'll meet tomorrow in camp.

163
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:28,849
Ok, boss.

164
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:30,714
Hombre?

165
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,888
We're a top team!

166
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:07,090
By god, that's terrible!

167
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:11,635
That doesn't look good, boss!

168
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:15,634
What a cowardish assassination!

169
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:24,632
Now they will also have to
answer for Hillarious Hare.

170
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:26,918
This means war!

171
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:29,257
Ooops, we have to leave! Jim, John!

172
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:33,680
Let's bow out on a high note!
Take care!

173
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,527
Unbury the hatchet!

174
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:39,817
We don't have one.

175
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:41,986
We don't?

176
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:45,057
We had one from the dollar store.

177
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,193
But it broke.

178
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,412
Well, what could we unbury?

179
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:53,338
We have a folding chair.

180
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,918
Unbury the folding chair!

181
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:01,958
What?

182
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,566
I smell something.

183
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,900
It wasn't me!

184
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,229
Look! The Shoshone are signalling!

185
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,549
And? What do they write?

186
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:21,010
They are after us.
And they unburied the folding chair!

187
00:16:21,178 --> 00:16:24,504
Now they've totally gone bonkers, right?

188
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:32,501
The chief of the Apache
must die!

189
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:34,122
To the horses!

190
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:39,271
We don't have horses.

191
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,049
Didn't I have one?

192
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:44,480
Well, yes, you did...

193
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:47,441
...but it shrunk in the laundry.

194
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:58,207
What area is this?

195
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:02,335
Down there we'll find the
second part of the map!

196
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:05,582
And? What are we waiting for?

197
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:09,756
There is something
you should know.

198
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,958
My white brother needs to be very strong now!

199
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:20,130
Abahachi! My brother!

200
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:24,590
Quick, hugs! My, what a surprise!

201
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:27,714
I didn't expect you!
I totally didn't pick up.

202
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:32,110
And who is that handsome
young man you brought?

203
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:36,960
Want to introduce us?
Welcome to Powder Rosa Ranch!

204
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:41,211
Twin brother Winnetouch, blood bruder
Ranger, blood brother, twin brother!

205
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:44,371
Antother brother!

206
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,378
Dangit!

207
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:11,372
I am out of splenda. Anyway.
One "Peach Fizz", no firewater...

208
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:16,999
For our patient a "pina colada".
Or would you rather like Prosecco?

209
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:23,075
To us! We won't meet again
that young! Cheers!

210
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:49,407
I am sooo curious.
Do tell me,

211
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:52,869
how did the two of you meet?

212
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:55,109
Well, Ranger was a greenhorn.

213
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:57,240
Wow! A greenhorn?

214
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,447
Then he saved my life.
And we said,

215
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:02,458
let's do blood brothers.

216
00:19:02,562 --> 00:19:03,941
Really, with scoring?

217
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:05,657
Yes.

218
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:10,528
You guys are fierce! But you've
always been a crazy chick!

219
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:14,739
That's why Abahachi became chief,
eben though I had the privilege,

220
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:19,490
cause I was born 2 minutes earlier.
But all that silly shouting and bang-bang

221
00:19:19,537 --> 00:19:23,695
and arrows and shooting and the noise...
I wanted to be pearl diver,

222
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:28,367
but I cannot hold my breath long enough.
Now I am the owner of this beauty ranch,

223
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:30,439
the "Powder Rosa Ranch". Do you like it?

224
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:32,571
What? Yes! Very lovely!

225
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:35,867
Winnetouch! We need your help!

226
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:12,613
Guys, we'll ride on. Get on!

227
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:30,735
We don't want to ride on!
We are tired!

228
00:20:32,572 --> 00:20:35,523
Who said that?

229
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:40,063
John did! John did!
Yes! We saw him!

230
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,396
So, you're tired, John.

231
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:58,120
Ok, go to bed. Everybody else: get on!

232
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,442
Oh dang! Assshole! Stupid pig!

233
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:02,514
What do you say?

234
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:04,645
Good night, John!

235
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,144
Mesdames et Messieurs.
My part of the map.

236
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:14,017
I knew I could rely on you!

237
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:16,068
Yeah, I am a pack rat.

238
00:21:16,111 --> 00:21:19,692
I even keep your old toys.
Your Apache puppet tent.

239
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:21,762
You played with puppets as a kid?

240
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,895
What? No puppets!

241
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:25,888
And? Can you already see something?

242
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:27,937
Yes, but not enough.

243
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,267
Too bad! Now what do we do?
Let's have a drink after that shock.

244
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:34,345
Another lychee limes?

245
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:36,477
Hm? No, thanks, Willi... Winnetouch!

246
00:21:36,526 --> 00:21:40,684
Do you recall by chance to whom
I gave the other two pieces?

247
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,446
Well, to the Greek and to Ushi!

248
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,265
Ah! Yes...

249
00:21:44,731 --> 00:21:47,849
Of course! The Greek! Uschi!

250
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:57,555
We'll have to find them, with the
Shoshones breathing down our necks.

251
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:39,969
We're interested in your rad horse!

252
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:46,342
We shouldn't have traded
the pony and the folding chair.

253
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
Stop whining.

254
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:52,450
That squeaking is annoying.

255
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:57,472
Let the men sing a song.

256
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:09,007
No! I am not wearing that!
It's itching!

257
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:13,717
With that I'll look like a maggot!

258
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:16,967
Ok, I'll explain it again.

259
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:22,342
Ranger will ride to Uschi
in Rosewell City.

260
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:25,590
I'll try to find the Greek.
You'll pretend you're me

261
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:28,189
to throw the Shoshones off our trail.

262
00:23:28,293 --> 00:23:30,841
Well, I smell totally different than you!

263
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,899
Right!

264
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:33,011
If everything works out,

265
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:37,216
we'll meet in the Thunder valley
at the dandelion at the old basswood,

266
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:38,465
where the sun kisses the squirrel.

267
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:39,772
I'll never find that.

268
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,385
Just a sec!

269
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:46,591
What if one of us suddenly gets sick?

270
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:53,116
Ok. If anything goes wrong
we'll meet back here

271
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:54,585
at Powder Rosa Ranch.

272
00:23:54,794 --> 00:23:57,680
Go there, come back, kiss basswood,
ride back and forth...

273
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,839
Why not just stay here
and I cook a nice dinner?

274
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:02,534
I can't shoot and fight anyway!

275
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:05,573
I'm afraid your, err our brother
needs a crash course.

276
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,919
Lesson 1: Stalking.
Suitable branches are very important.

277
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:17,172
Tree, bush, or twig.
Stalking is most fun on even ground.

278
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,378
Smooth, rhythmical movements make
for quick and unnoticed progress.

279
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:25,586
Indians have stalking in their genes,

280
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:30,127
however, everybody develops
their own style eventually.

281
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:34,087
Lesson 2: Close combat.
Rule of thumb:

282
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:38,957
Lefties use their left fist,
righties use the other one.

283
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:43,084
Precise targeting increases
the chances for a hit.

284
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:49,252
Lesson 3: War paint.
War paint has a long tradition

285
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:53,423
and is used to scare the enemy.

286
00:24:53,466 --> 00:24:59,712
Abstract war paint is frequently met
with lack of understanding and intoleration.

287
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:02,544
Lesson 4: Riding.

288
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:06,749
Anticipatory riding is mandatory
for the athletic rider!

289
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:12,001
The horse is both a status symbol
and provides mobility in the Wild West.

290
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:16,290
Opinions diverge regarding women at the wheel.

291
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:21,376
Lesson 5: Pipe of peace.
This symbolic act of reconcilation

292
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:26,624
is also called "chill out after battle".
Precise measurements are crucial.

293
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:32,088
Too much or the wrong stuff can
have undesired side effects.

294
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:35,246
Last but not least: Shooting.

295
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:39,455
The showcase of all skill!
High tech! Man and machine

296
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,170
must form one entity.
Choice of weapon and caliber

297
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,087
must form one entity.
Choice of weapon and caliber

298
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:48,087
is crucial for the shooter.

299
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:57,662
We'll leave at sunrise!

300
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:04,529
They are down there, boss!

301
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:06,660
Good. Don't lose sight of them.

302
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,323
Post guards.

303
00:26:08,427 --> 00:26:10,041
Yes, post guards.

304
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,409
Post guards!

305
00:26:12,835 --> 00:26:15,704
Post guards!

306
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:16,734
Hombre.

307
00:26:16,838 --> 00:26:17,824
Yes?

308
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,382
Go ahead and brew coffee.

309
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:20,994
What is that?

310
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:23,707
A hot, caffeinated beverage.

311
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:38,582
My father!

312
00:26:38,582 --> 00:26:39,916
He was still young back than.
Always in a good mood. A crazy dog.

313
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:43,246
He was still young back than.
Always in a good mood. A crazy dog.

314
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,963
He was fluent in French.

315
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,737
How come?

316
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:51,695
We don't know. I also got
the long hair from him.

317
00:26:51,997 --> 00:26:54,450
Who is that?

318
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:58,657
That's Winnetouch.
With Leatherstocking.

319
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:05,577
And this is Uschi.
What a woman!

320
00:27:06,996 --> 00:27:13,492
Back in the day she left the tribe
to become a singer in Rosewell City.

321
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:29,360
What is that?

322
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:33,230
Someone is brewing coffee.

323
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:35,362
The shoshone make coffee?

324
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:40,316
Winnetouch go hide!
They must not see us together!

325
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:55,484
We are trapped!

326
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,317
Surprise!

327
00:28:04,243 --> 00:28:05,851
What is that?

328
00:28:06,373 --> 00:28:08,401
My little secret tunnel!

329
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,566
Takes you straight to a bush.

330
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:56,694
Are you guys Shoshones?

331
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:58,645
Indians!

332
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,554
Indians!

333
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:01,644
Quick, follow him!

334
00:29:03,237 --> 00:29:05,286
We'll get him!

335
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:07,442
Yes, I'll cut him off!

336
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:12,026
Don't let the redskin get away.
Don't shoot, we need him alive!

337
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:17,814
My brother.
My brother.

338
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:02,158
What do you think why I pulled you over?

339
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,314
Are you a photographer?

340
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:08,396
Careful, young man!
I don't have to do this friendly!

341
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,280
Did you soup up that horse?

342
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:12,645
It's my brother in law's horse.

343
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:14,716
And what's the reason for the hurry?

344
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:16,848
The Shoshones, you know...

345
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:18,947
They unburied the folding chair.

346
00:30:19,156 --> 00:30:21,103
The folding chair.

347
00:30:21,146 --> 00:30:24,014
Well, Mr... Ranger.

348
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:28,185
Please blow here.

349
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,553
0,0 blood alcohol! Golly!

350
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:37,891
Nobody managed to pull that off yet!
Have a good ride!

351
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,558
Hiya!

352
00:31:24,391 --> 00:31:27,555
I think I see a mirage!

353
00:31:28,139 --> 00:31:29,647
Dimitri!

354
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,257
Abahachi!

355
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,270
Bless you!

356
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,882
It really is you!

357
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:39,091
Look, friends, this is Abahachi,
the famous chief Apache,

358
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:41,688
warrior and brother of Ranger.

359
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:44,341
You'll be the hero in my new book.

360
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:46,398
Who's he?

361
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,513
Karl May. Only silly things in his head.

362
00:31:48,554 --> 00:31:50,062
Say, how did you find me?

363
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:51,880
You're mentioned in the travel guide.

364
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:53,730
Let's have a drink to that!

365
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:56,887
No. I need to talk to you!

366
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,666
It's about our little secret.

367
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,509
Hellas!

368
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:04,467
Are you talking about
our map treasure?

369
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,794
A book about an Indian treasure!

370
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:15,789
Good one!

371
00:32:19,158 --> 00:32:20,668
Where is the treasure map?

372
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:23,009
The map?
Ranger has it.

373
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:24,329
Oh god. I am tattling too much.

374
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,543
And where is that Ranger?

375
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:28,666
Shopping!

376
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,641
Listen up, Abahachi, chief of the...

377
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:34,921
Apache!

378
00:32:35,385 --> 00:32:36,473
Thanks, Hombre.

379
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:38,085
No problem, boss.

380
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:42,606
Even my patience has its limits.
My men are mean, brutal, and very lonely.

381
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:44,681
They could hurt you really bad.

382
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:46,500
An indian doesn't know pain.

383
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:49,299
We lack those enzymes!

384
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,255
Ow, ow, ow!

385
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:54,587
Ow! Ow!

386
00:32:54,632 --> 00:32:57,750
Ok, that's enough!

387
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:04,796
Well, Abahachi? Will you now tell
where Ranger went?

388
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,999
Yeah, great, now you got me.
He went to meet Uschi!

389
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:10,138
That Uschi?

390
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,935
Yes. Now untie me.
I am not playing anymore.

391
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:16,372
No can do, Abahachi.

392
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:18,451
We need you as a hostage!

393
00:33:18,555 --> 00:33:20,582
You're soo mean!

394
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:24,789
Hombre, you stay here
and guard our chief.

395
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:29,080
If we don't return within 2 days,
finish him off.

396
00:33:32,462 --> 00:33:35,580
Allright, boss!

397
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:41,371
I'm warning you! When you go to the
restroom, you'll better sit down!

398
00:33:47,544 --> 00:33:50,545
One Four Harlots!

399
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:06,954
How do the eyes get in the cheese?

400
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:10,577
Hiya.

401
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:14,784
You must be Ranger!
The man with the southern dialect.

402
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:19,454
Friend of the Indians. Founder of
"mothers against fire arrows".

403
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:23,660
What brings you to this godforsaken lands?

404
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:29,039
Does someone named Uschi work here?

405
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:31,157
Oh yeah!

406
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,445
Hi!

407
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,575
Hello, you!

408
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:53,787
I ask you
and all the the other men, too.

409
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:57,950
Is it true that I'm driving you crazy?

410
00:34:58,706 --> 00:35:01,111
Come on, tell me, sugar boys.

411
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:05,697
And what you get is what you see,

412
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:09,619
you can't help, you must fall for me.

413
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:13,575
What's in your hardest dreams,
I go for...

414
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:29,149
It's the clue that me
as a good girl

415
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:33,068
wanna whip my hip like that.

416
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:59,771
You got... beautiful bells.

417
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,646
These are my grandma's bells.

418
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,570
Great!

419
00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:08,100
Do you have a needle and
some thread by chance?

420
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:10,522
Oh! Yes. Of course.

421
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:19,606
Here you go!

422
00:36:33,196 --> 00:36:34,786
Well, now you're here.

423
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,479
Yes!

424
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,335
Yes! Well, then I can leave again.

425
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,125
No, don't go.

426
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:45,982
I am... actually here
for the treasure map.

427
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:48,266
Oh god!

428
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,231
You do have a part
of the map, right?

429
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:52,307
Could you undo my choker?

430
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,273
Yes, sure!

431
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,367
Don't talk about the map!

432
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:58,226
Come again?

433
00:36:58,277 --> 00:37:00,974
Do not talk about the map here!

434
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,777
Ok, I'll stand over there.

435
00:37:05,443 --> 00:37:09,604
Abahachi already got two pieces
of the treasure map.

436
00:37:09,653 --> 00:37:12,725
Dimitri, that Greek guy, has another part.

437
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,701
Hush!

438
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:16,273
And you have the last part.

439
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,331
The map is complete
and everybody will be happy.

440
00:37:22,194 --> 00:37:25,354
Yes. Now I am happy, too.

441
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:29,144
Hey, you guys didn't
eavesdrop on us, did you?

442
00:37:29,526 --> 00:37:33,685
Ranger, I have to make a confession.
We hold Abahachi hostage.

443
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,759
Wonderful, it had to come like that!

444
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:39,820
And you, my little gold fish,
will tell me your sweet secret, quick!

445
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:42,440
Where is your part of the map?

446
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:46,165
Or do you want me to
let my men loose?

447
00:37:49,649 --> 00:37:50,947
Eeek!

448
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,351
Hands off!

449
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:56,849
She has nothing to do with all this!
Take me instead!

450
00:38:00,149 --> 00:38:03,144
Ugh, ok, take her instead!

451
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:37,635
A beautiful rear can also endear.
Especially when it's about gold.

452
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:38,943
Oh, well.

453
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:40,305
So!

454
00:38:40,353 --> 00:38:45,057
If you want, go get an ice cream,
and then let's get back to camp!

455
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:05,632
Then we moved cause they chased us
away from our territories.

456
00:39:05,684 --> 00:39:09,842
We became backpack indians.
Originally I wanted to

457
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:14,050
go to San Francisco and be a pearl diver.
But that's teeming with earthquakes.

458
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,259
Do you even know what an earthquake is?
No worries, you didn't miss out.

459
00:39:18,308 --> 00:39:21,423
Done, ready for the spa!

460
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:48,354
Uh-oh.

461
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,964
What's it?

462
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,874
Apollo 13 is afraid of the
road rail crossing.

463
00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:53,757
How come?

464
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:59,885
His 12 brothers were all hit
by a big locomotive steam!

465
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:03,045
Only one thing can help: Ouzo!

466
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:08,292
My, Dimitri! We have to keep moving!
There is no train to be seen!

467
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:16,046
See, Apollo 13 is an intelligent mule!

468
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:25,093
Apollo 13. Have you bonkers gone?

469
00:40:25,136 --> 00:40:27,006
Oh!

470
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:31,506
Come, I beg you!
Apollo 13, don't make us unhappy!

471
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:35,719
This is a really fast train.

472
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:43,128
Apollo 13! Don't always be
such a head bull! Hellas!

473
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:46,791
That might get a bit close.

474
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:30,919
Great, now we can move on!

475
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:49,037
Dismount! We'll stay here for the night.

476
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:52,201
At sunrise we move on to
Powder Rosa Ranch.

477
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:06,328
Why the heck is the light on in my hut?

478
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:11,414
But boss, that's John.
Remember, you sent him to bed.

479
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:13,534
Ah, right!

480
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:18,743
Isn't it great to come home and know:

481
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:23,994
There is someone waiting for you.
Smell of fresh coffee in the air,

482
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:29,375
crispy fried bacon, and in the distance
a wolf songs a lonely song.

483
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:32,164
Strangers in the night...

484
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:37,740
What an asshole!
John drank from my cup!

485
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,816
John slept in my bed!

486
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,951
John put my pen in his ass!

487
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:46,157
Yes, that's John.

488
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:01,757
Did you know the Shoshones
had a folding chair?

489
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:02,951
No.

490
00:43:02,995 --> 00:43:05,069
Yes!

491
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:13,573
Oh, look, the full moon!

492
00:43:15,744 --> 00:43:16,693
Yes.

493
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:25,030
Back in the day at a full moon,
Abahachi and me often went for a swim.

494
00:43:25,077 --> 00:43:29,700
We hid each others clothes
and laid little tracks.

495
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:33,903
He was always so emphatic.
He consoled me

496
00:43:33,952 --> 00:43:37,529
when the Little Beaver was hurting me.

497
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:42,730
And what happend to your Little Beaver?

498
00:43:42,908 --> 00:43:46,405
Well, Big Beaver.
Chief of the Kiowa.

499
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,192
Ah, I see.

500
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,314
Uschi?

501
00:43:51,418 --> 00:43:52,429
Yes?

502
00:43:52,992 --> 00:43:56,653
Can you reach my left back pocket?

503
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,706
Do you have a...

504
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,588
Yes!

505
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:23,524
Do you hear that?

506
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:25,646
Yes.

507
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,827
They play our song.

508
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,521
Yes.

509
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:58,316
Where the heck is that Ranger!
He's usually on time!

510
00:44:58,361 --> 00:45:00,595
Hope he didn't get sick.

511
00:45:00,804 --> 00:45:02,520
Look. There!

512
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,349
Yet another star shooting.

513
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,232
Ah, now you can make a wish.

514
00:45:08,276 --> 00:45:12,436
I'd like to be an Indian.
A real skin red.

515
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,567
Hm.

516
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:18,982
Why? I mean, being Greek isn't bad either!

517
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:23,184
Not bad, but do you remember,
even when I was Dimitri little,

518
00:45:23,233 --> 00:45:27,393
that was my big dream.
Ever since your grandpa Gray Star

519
00:45:27,442 --> 00:45:31,601
picked me out of the Mississippi.
I was in that little basket.

520
00:45:31,649 --> 00:45:35,807
just about to go over that big fall water!
It was close!

521
00:45:35,857 --> 00:45:37,886
I was a very happy child foster.

522
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,017
You were not a foster child,

523
00:45:40,067 --> 00:45:43,726
you were age 16 and
in the middle of puberty!

524
00:45:43,773 --> 00:45:48,394
I strongly believe in it.
One day I'll be an indian.

525
00:45:48,439 --> 00:45:53,144
Not riding a mule anymore
but a real horse.

526
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:01,219
Do you need a nutcracker? No?

527
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:06,510
Get up, guys! Get up!
Up, up, up!

528
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:08,637
Get up!

529
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:16,305
Jeffrey farted!
Really!

530
00:46:18,396 --> 00:46:22,057
Jeffrey farted again!

531
00:46:22,604 --> 00:46:27,724
Morning, guys! Everybody go pee,
and then we ride on!

532
00:46:47,852 --> 00:46:50,968
Ho! Ho! Ho!

533
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:07,215
Hey!

534
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,176
And on we go!

535
00:47:24,223 --> 00:47:27,802
Jim, John! Come with me!

536
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:34,376
Damnit! Abahachi escaped!

537
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,176
Respect!

538
00:47:44,971 --> 00:47:46,892
No outside shoes in here!

539
00:47:46,996 --> 00:47:48,918
Yes! Got another one!

540
00:47:48,973 --> 00:47:51,583
Hombre is really great at diving for pearls!

541
00:47:51,688 --> 00:47:53,260
Get out!

542
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,840
Turn around!

543
00:48:07,261 --> 00:48:08,636
Oops!

544
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:14,332
Jeffrey farted!

545
00:48:14,468 --> 00:48:17,467
The damn lock is jammed.

546
00:48:20,344 --> 00:48:21,849
Hands up!

547
00:48:21,953 --> 00:48:23,460
Yes! Drop your weapon!

548
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:36,082
Feather!

549
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:42,123
This... is... the... shoe...

550
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:45,540
of... Ma-ni-tou.

551
00:48:46,425 --> 00:48:48,179
The shoe of Manitou?

552
00:48:48,283 --> 00:48:50,038
Oh, no.

553
00:48:50,382 --> 00:48:55,039
That was easy. Hombre, you coming?
We need to get going!

554
00:49:01,257 --> 00:49:03,295
Ranger!

555
00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:07,878
If you think it's over,
there's a light in the darkness.

556
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:11,960
i before e except after c!

557
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:14,662
Hombre!

558
00:49:16,964 --> 00:49:19,884
Do you have a last wish?

559
00:49:19,989 --> 00:49:22,912
Yes, the song from the
super-perforator ad!

560
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,123
Yeehaw!

561
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:25,113
Come on, guys! Let's move!

562
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:36,550
There is your light!

563
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:38,829
They torch my house without asking first!

564
00:50:38,873 --> 00:50:42,120
Abahachi, please pass me the knife.

565
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:46,288
Shoot. I must have forgotten it
after whittling in the Thunder valley.

566
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,524
Why do indians always have to whittle!

567
00:50:48,627 --> 00:50:50,821
Got a problem with my hobby?

568
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:55,327
Nothing against your hobby, it's just about
the knife! These do cost money, you know!

569
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:59,531
Learn to watch for your stuff!
Your sloppiness is driving me nuts!

570
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,565
You are driving me nuts, too!

571
00:51:01,669 --> 00:51:03,656
Come on, spit it out!

572
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:08,111
Always affairs: "Would you like
to see my bear killer, mylady?"

573
00:51:08,161 --> 00:51:12,321
Says the guy who used to play with
puppets and can't even grow a beard!

574
00:51:12,371 --> 00:51:14,920
Forget the beard! You need character!

575
00:51:15,024 --> 00:51:17,572
Great character, hiding women's
clothes at night!

576
00:51:17,621 --> 00:51:22,241
So? I'll even admit it! At least
women do go for a swim with me!

577
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:24,816
Uschi would go for a swim
with me any time!

578
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:26,410
Ridiculous!

579
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:28,931
Would you stop it?
Till someone's crying!

580
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:29,524
Oh, you shut up!

581
00:51:30,346 --> 00:51:31,795
Hellas!

582
00:51:32,316 --> 00:51:33,869
Dimitri! There you are!

583
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:43,109
Hey! Wanna ride with me?
I got plenty of room!

584
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,281
No! I cannot ride in that!

585
00:51:46,325 --> 00:51:49,323
Walk, Jacqueline.

586
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:54,446
Slow, slow! Careful!
Don't go so fast or you'll throw up again.

587
00:51:57,867 --> 00:52:00,779
The shoe of Manitou!

588
00:52:22,282 --> 00:52:26,439
Shortly I'll be the richest man in the West.

589
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:29,037
I could make you my woman!

590
00:52:29,141 --> 00:52:31,690
But I am already a woman...?

591
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:38,142
Nice and slow, Jacqueline,
or you'll throw up again!

592
00:52:38,452 --> 00:52:43,355
At this speed snail
we'll never get there!

593
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:53,109
Walk! Walk, Jacqueline!

594
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,478
Yes, yes, good, Jacqueline.

595
00:52:59,527 --> 00:53:04,314
I've told them a thousand times
you have a sensitive stomach.

596
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:08,483
Let it all out, Jaqueline!
Not through the nose.

597
00:53:10,569 --> 00:53:13,318
Honey, I'll be back in a sec.

598
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:17,892
That's what you get for
your reckless speeding!

599
00:53:19,025 --> 00:53:21,098
Hombre!

600
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:27,850
Oh, you should have emptied
the ashtray in time!

601
00:53:28,732 --> 00:53:33,106
Well, you'll stay here and think
about what you've done.

602
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:37,392
Jim, John! You guys come with me.
Everybody else stays here.

603
00:53:40,398 --> 00:53:44,392
And pay good attention
to my future bride!

604
00:53:50,315 --> 00:53:53,396
And don't give her
more cherries!

605
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,428
Hey, Santa!

606
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:04,360
Will you bring us a gift?

607
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:06,137
Something exciting!

608
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:08,008
Something to play with! Yes!

609
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:09,932
And chocolate! Yes!

610
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:15,013
Better have an apple instead.

611
00:54:22,478 --> 00:54:26,058
No old indian
guarding the treasure?

612
00:54:26,686 --> 00:54:29,802
That's unusual.

613
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,108
Hello?

614
00:54:34,213 --> 00:54:35,761
Hello? Hello?

615
00:54:47,726 --> 00:54:49,799
Cuckoo.

616
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:51,317
Cuckoo.

617
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,884
Cuckoo.

618
00:54:52,934 --> 00:54:54,961
Ok, now get out.

619
00:54:55,065 --> 00:54:57,092
Ok, now get out.

620
00:55:01,309 --> 00:55:05,800
Can I have a bite from yours?
Mine is mealy.

621
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,625
Hellas, they are down there!

622
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:13,006
Do you guys see Uschi?

623
00:55:13,223 --> 00:55:15,524
No. I think we'll need a plan.

624
00:55:15,628 --> 00:55:17,927
Want me to distract them again?

625
00:55:17,973 --> 00:55:21,091
Uh... pff... mh-mh!

626
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:24,962
Ok, I'll change clothes again!

627
00:55:26,015 --> 00:55:27,471
Alarm!

628
00:55:27,514 --> 00:55:30,133
Hellas y'all!

629
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:32,227
Who the heck is he?

630
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:33,881
No idea.

631
00:55:33,932 --> 00:55:35,957
What's your business here?

632
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:38,090
I am Dimitri Stoubakis.

633
00:55:38,138 --> 00:55:43,341
Bandit exchange from Greece;
supposed to check in with Maria Santa?

634
00:55:47,054 --> 00:55:50,052
This is a dead end, boss!

635
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:53,343
They tricked us.

636
00:55:53,387 --> 00:55:57,380
John? When do we
usually do lunch?

637
00:55:57,595 --> 00:55:59,714
Around 12.

638
00:56:09,428 --> 00:56:13,088
Jeffrey farted again!

639
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:40,296
Hush!

640
00:56:40,341 --> 00:56:42,414
Ranger!

641
00:56:42,507 --> 00:56:44,582
Uschi!

642
00:56:52,964 --> 00:56:56,082
How did you find me?

643
00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:59,249
For first time...
awesome!

644
00:57:03,547 --> 00:57:05,574
Now would you stop it!

645
00:57:05,678 --> 00:57:07,706
Winnetouch! I thought you were...

646
00:57:07,755 --> 00:57:11,915
Hombre! Bad weeds grow tall!
Are you on our side now?

647
00:57:49,377 --> 00:57:52,495
Ok, kids. You take a lunch break.

648
00:57:54,002 --> 00:57:56,076
Clear!

649
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:59,077
So clear!

650
00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:03,702
The coast is so clear! Yes, yes.

651
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:07,908
I'd suggest we introduce ourselves.
Dimitri Stoubakis. 30 years old.

652
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:12,118
My zodiac is virgo and
in my time free I tinker

653
00:58:12,168 --> 00:58:16,325
house birds with my saw hand.
What are your hobbies?

654
00:58:17,957 --> 00:58:19,985
And why can't we come?

655
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:22,117
Exactly! Who says...

656
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:26,325
you're not gonna take off
with the treasure?

657
00:58:30,497 --> 00:58:32,757
What was that?

658
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:35,121
That was the sound
of Santa Maria's colt.

659
00:58:40,206 --> 00:58:44,827
That's it. Cover me.
I'm going in.

660
00:58:44,956 --> 00:58:46,378
My brother!

661
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:47,907
Yes?

662
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:48,981
Take care!

663
00:58:49,086 --> 00:58:50,113
Ok.

664
00:58:50,164 --> 00:58:53,243
Take cover.

665
00:58:56,037 --> 00:58:57,444
Winnetouch!

666
00:58:57,548 --> 00:58:58,951
What's it?

667
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:00,229
Cover!

668
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:01,567
Come again?

669
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,647
Go hide!

670
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:05,778
Ok, I'll try.

671
00:59:07,162 --> 00:59:09,235
Ah!

672
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,534
Hello? Dang it,
is this a darkroom?

673
00:59:20,453 --> 00:59:23,568
Get lost, stupid bat!

674
00:59:24,743 --> 00:59:26,920
My, what it looks like here!

675
00:59:27,024 --> 00:59:29,199
Like the place has
been hit by a bomb.

676
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:35,939
Thanks god the light
is off again!

677
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:12,193
Stop that!

678
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:06,020
Are you crazy?
Don't scare me like that!

679
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:08,095
Say, what do you have there?

680
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,227
Nothing! What are you guys doing here?

681
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:12,369
I told you to keep cover!

682
01:01:12,473 --> 01:01:14,564
If it always takes you so long...

683
01:01:14,608 --> 01:01:16,116
What?

684
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,726
Yes! Everything takes you ages!

685
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:18,738
You dwaddle! You're a slowpoke!

686
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:19,802
I am a slowpoke!

687
01:01:19,906 --> 01:01:21,102
Ranger!

688
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:24,008
He has a point, others say that, too.

689
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:26,143
Hear that? He's provoking me!

690
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:30,351
For years now! I don't have to listen
to this any longer from a...

691
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:32,427
second class mouth organ player!

692
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:34,557
Why don't you just get
a hair cut before we talk?

693
01:01:34,606 --> 01:01:36,115
Unbound cheek!

694
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,767
Why don't y'all write down what
you down like about the other?

695
01:01:38,816 --> 01:01:40,843
He can't even write!

696
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,974
Nobody in our gang can!

697
01:01:43,023 --> 01:01:44,529
I don't need to write.
I can read tracks!

698
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:46,140
Great! That's a start!

699
01:01:46,191 --> 01:01:50,349
This is his only point!
"I can read tracks!"

700
01:01:50,398 --> 01:01:52,425
You are such a great tracker!

701
01:01:52,528 --> 01:01:54,555
I am not taking this any longer!

702
01:01:54,605 --> 01:01:56,633
And you call yourself blood brother!

703
01:01:56,735 --> 01:01:58,765
I've always said,
I need more time.

704
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:02,973
He wanted to be blood brothers
after only two weeks!

705
01:02:03,021 --> 01:02:07,180
He probably felt like it back then.

706
01:02:07,229 --> 01:02:09,255
When you're a kid you do stupid things.

707
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,390
Stupid things?

708
01:02:11,438 --> 01:02:13,506
Did I hear "stupid things", Uschi?

709
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:15,680
I didn't pay attention...

710
01:02:15,729 --> 01:02:17,945
Yes, I think he said "stupid things".

711
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:20,267
Being blood brothers is stupid? Ok!

712
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:22,338
Then we'll stop it. I quit!

713
01:02:22,442 --> 01:02:24,470
Me too, let's quit!

714
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:26,547
See if I care! I don't need you!

715
01:02:26,651 --> 01:02:28,679
Ok, in that case,
I'd like my toothbrush back!

716
01:02:28,728 --> 01:02:32,887
Here you go! As far as I remember,
you still have my peace pipe!

717
01:02:32,935 --> 01:02:37,093
Take it!

718
01:02:39,352 --> 01:02:41,379
Come on, we don't need no Ranger!

719
01:02:41,483 --> 01:02:43,511
Abahachi, I...

720
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,527
Yes, what is it?

721
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,599
I cannot go with you.

722
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:50,841
What, why?

723
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,843
Ranger and I, we...

724
01:02:56,684 --> 01:03:02,181
That's exactly why we never
allowed girls in our gang!

725
01:03:02,224 --> 01:03:05,305
I am so sorry!

726
01:03:06,017 --> 01:03:08,421
Yes, but...

727
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,552
Full moon...

728
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:14,807
Swimming, hiding clothes...

729
01:03:17,222 --> 01:03:21,307
And you always told me:
Abahachi, when we grow up...

730
01:03:21,307 --> 01:03:22,722
And you always told me:
Abahachi, when we grow up...

731
01:03:22,722 --> 01:03:25,222
But 5 feet is not grown up!

732
01:03:28,598 --> 01:03:31,264
I see.

733
01:03:31,973 --> 01:03:35,337
So it's the two of you now.

734
01:03:39,389 --> 01:03:42,504
Well, then I don't want to...
Well...

735
01:03:44,472 --> 01:03:46,960
I wish you...

736
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:52,583
I guess I'll go in alone.
I actually prefer it that way anyway.

737
01:03:52,636 --> 01:03:57,707
So, where is the entrance?
Time to read some tracks!

738
01:03:58,052 --> 01:04:00,173
There we go!

739
01:04:33,091 --> 01:04:36,209
I got one left.

740
01:04:43,674 --> 01:04:46,078
Abahachi!

741
01:04:50,964 --> 01:04:54,082
It was self-defense!

742
01:05:04,464 --> 01:05:09,453
You little slicky sausage.
You thought you could get away

743
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:11,657
with everything!

744
01:05:11,761 --> 01:05:13,913
Hombre! Not in that tone!

745
01:05:14,213 --> 01:05:18,123
I've been watching this for long enough now.

746
01:05:18,421 --> 01:05:22,664
The wind has changed, buddy!

747
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:25,829
Ok, I'll bring it back.

748
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:37,150
My brother!

749
01:07:37,409 --> 01:07:39,648
My brother!

750
01:07:39,699 --> 01:07:41,773
You're alive?

751
01:07:47,742 --> 01:07:51,734
His candy heart saved his life!

752
01:07:51,949 --> 01:07:52,650
Yes, I'm alive!

753
01:07:52,754 --> 01:07:53,456
He's alive?

754
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,065
Yes!

755
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:29,014
Hombre! Don't make yourself unhappy!

756
01:09:29,067 --> 01:09:34,269
We're all a little stressed.
You've always been so good to me!

757
01:09:34,316 --> 01:09:39,516
You often saved my life,
helped me with my divorces!

758
01:09:39,564 --> 01:09:44,222
You allowed me to lead a comfortable
life free of worries.

759
01:09:44,274 --> 01:09:46,325
Do you want to risk all that?

760
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:48,481
Give me that necklace!

761
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:53,724
Oh, that's what it's all about.
Why don't you say so. If that's all.

762
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:58,514
Woah! Crazy, isn't it?

763
01:09:58,563 --> 01:10:00,590
There you are! My, I had an experience!

764
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:02,722
Sshh!

765
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:06,931
Look at that!
That's not how it's supposed to be!

766
01:10:11,312 --> 01:10:13,386
Sorry!

767
01:10:16,938 --> 01:10:20,052
That doesn't look too bad!

768
01:10:20,102 --> 01:10:23,551
That's the end to your evil deeds!

769
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:25,961
I will never get that out!

770
01:10:26,066 --> 01:10:28,425
Oh, what a dream!

771
01:10:29,019 --> 01:10:31,378
This is our treasure!

772
01:10:31,482 --> 01:10:33,842
My, may I wear it?

773
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:38,268
Mesdames et Messieurs... voila!

774
01:10:38,268 --> 01:10:39,101
Mesdames et Messieurs... voila!

775
01:10:46,934 --> 01:10:49,633
Hey, where are you going?

776
01:10:49,737 --> 01:10:52,435
Faster! Faster! Come on!

777
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:57,629
Have you used such a thing before?

778
01:10:57,733 --> 01:11:00,431
Yes, but a different model!

779
01:11:06,682 --> 01:11:07,925
Noo!

780
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:33,596
Heads down!

781
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:42,544
How much more to go?
I can't hold it any longer! Wow!

782
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:51,843
Winnetouch!

783
01:11:57,678 --> 01:11:59,502
Faster!

784
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,967
What is that?

785
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:12,469
I've never heard anything like that!

786
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:15,958
So beautiful.

787
01:12:23,425 --> 01:12:27,502
Hellas! You came to
safe me, right?

788
01:12:35,509 --> 01:12:37,215
Indians!

789
01:12:51,172 --> 01:12:55,333
A classic down show,
if I am not taken mis!

790
01:13:10,755 --> 01:13:13,835
Come on, let's scram!

791
01:13:20,878 --> 01:13:22,953
Abahachi!

792
01:13:31,043 --> 01:13:32,501
Hiya!

793
01:13:32,544 --> 01:13:34,928
This time Abahachi won't escape!

794
01:13:35,032 --> 01:13:37,415
No need for that!

795
01:13:37,461 --> 01:13:40,376
Winnetouch, would you come please?

796
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:46,656
By Manitou! Two times Abahachi?

797
01:13:48,127 --> 01:13:49,655
Hello!

798
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,289
Winnetouch? Give him the treasure!

799
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:52,842
My god!

800
01:13:52,946 --> 01:13:54,202
What?

801
01:13:54,751 --> 01:13:55,967
Gone!

802
01:13:56,071 --> 01:13:57,286
You don't say!

803
01:13:57,334 --> 01:13:58,840
That was so obvious!

804
01:13:58,943 --> 01:14:00,451
What do you mean, "gone"?

805
01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:02,214
Gone!

806
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:04,030
Abahachi lies! Kill him!

807
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:06,776
Hey, where did you get that?

808
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,990
Mighty Mole? Here is your gold!

809
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:14,195
Santa Maria stole it from you!
He is also the murderer of your son.

810
01:14:14,248 --> 01:14:16,816
I saw it with my own eyes.

811
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,486
But where is Santa Maria?

812
01:14:26,289 --> 01:14:31,031
Oh well, Abahachi did not murder
my son Rabid Rabbit!

813
01:14:31,082 --> 01:14:34,243
But what about Hillarious Hare?

814
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:36,317
Oh, difficult.

815
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:38,449
I think I got something for you!

816
01:14:50,913 --> 01:14:52,774
You look absolutely lovely, darling!

817
01:14:52,878 --> 01:14:54,740
Thank you!

818
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:59,071
Yes, so do you. But you may
want to try horizontal stripes.

819
01:14:59,332 --> 01:15:00,895
Really accents your figure.

820
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:03,992
I'll go get some drinks at the Prosecco store.
I'll be back in a bit.

821
01:15:04,036 --> 01:15:07,117
Ok, kids, now off with...

822
01:15:08,244 --> 01:15:09,436
Uschi.

823
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,733
Yes?

824
01:15:10,787 --> 01:15:14,400
I think I know now where I belong.

825
01:15:14,702 --> 01:15:16,581
Oh, Ranger!

826
01:15:16,684 --> 01:15:18,566
You know, I thought...

827
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:22,778
Yes, I know! You and
Abahachi must move on!

828
01:15:22,827 --> 01:15:24,289
What?

829
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:25,860
The country needs you!

830
01:15:25,994 --> 01:15:31,230
No, just a sec. I meant to
say that you and me...

831
01:15:31,285 --> 01:15:36,487
Both of us now and the child...
We're a family now...

832
01:15:36,535 --> 01:15:39,272
Family is all well and good

833
01:15:39,376 --> 01:15:42,114
But you must not shy away
from your responsibilities!

834
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:45,738
There is a blood brother
out there waiting for you!

835
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:51,065
Together you'll fight for peace,
freedom, and justice!

836
01:15:52,031 --> 01:15:57,780
Found national parks!
Free the afro-american inhabitants,

837
01:15:57,865 --> 01:16:01,196
out there from the shackles of slavery!

838
01:16:01,947 --> 01:16:06,487
So that one day it will say
on page 1 of some history book:

839
01:16:06,532 --> 01:16:12,360
This book belongs to Peter Miller,
class of Miss Sanz.

840
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:19,109
I'll do all of that, but can you
help me out of this?

841
01:16:19,654 --> 01:16:23,101
Well, Ranger, would you please come...

842
01:16:23,196 --> 01:16:25,703
Abahachi, could you give me a hand here?

843
01:16:25,808 --> 01:16:28,316
No! That'll be the day!

844
01:16:40,904 --> 01:16:45,062
You saved my life and
gave a saloon to my tribe.

845
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:47,097
Dimitri, my brother!

846
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:49,188
Abahachi, my brother!

847
01:16:54,817 --> 01:16:57,935
I am an indian!

848
01:16:59,733 --> 01:17:01,283
Good evening.

849
01:17:01,387 --> 01:17:02,934
Good evening. Good evening.

850
01:17:02,983 --> 01:17:07,144
What's the toy of the weasel?
Easel, easel.

851
01:17:07,193 --> 01:17:12,392
In 1879, Karl May published
his first Wild West novel.

852
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,470
It becomes a bestseller!

853
01:17:14,574 --> 01:17:16,601
Later that year he returned

854
01:17:16,651 --> 01:17:21,271
to Germany and married the daughter
of a theater director in Bad Segeberg.

855
01:17:21,316 --> 01:17:22,680
Bless you!

856
01:17:22,784 --> 01:17:24,148
A year later,

857
01:17:24,483 --> 01:17:28,641
Frederico Enrico Nico Gonzalez
Desperado del Torro-Hombre

858
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:33,892
files a patent for the BBQ ashtray.

859
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:38,846
Dec 24, 1879: Santa Maria's brother
Santa Claus brings gifts for children

860
01:17:39,064 --> 01:17:44,267
to compensate for the
deeds of his brother.

861
01:17:44,315 --> 01:17:48,556
1882: Winnetouch founds the
designer label "Think Pink".

862
01:17:48,605 --> 01:17:50,508
Ok, done!

863
01:17:50,612 --> 01:17:52,517
Mighty Mole is now Mighty Hare!

864
01:17:55,146 --> 01:17:59,354
Oh my, he can wear that...
with his figure!

865
01:17:59,396 --> 01:18:04,598
On July 4, 1884, an indian chief
is arrested in New York

866
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:09,055
wearing a rabbit costume.
He's deported to a reservation.

867
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:17,599
Only four months later,
Stan Laurel is born.

868
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:24,219
All of that, Abahachi and
Ranger never knew.

869
01:18:28,185 --> 01:18:32,806
What do you say?
Swing by the Grand Canyon?

870
01:18:32,851 --> 01:18:37,510
While we're there we can found a
national park for afro-american immigrants.

871
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,569
What? Who?

872
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:41,683
Tell me, whom do you know?

873
01:18:41,768 --> 01:18:43,919
Well, Old Shatterhand, for example.

874
01:18:44,024 --> 01:18:46,175
Well, everybody knows him.

875
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:48,358
Then go ride somewhere else.

876
01:18:48,463 --> 01:18:50,597
You go ride somewhere else!

877
01:18:57,433 --> 01:18:59,401
Come on, we don't need no Ranger!

878
01:18:59,505 --> 01:19:01,473
Abahachi...

879
01:19:01,556 --> 01:19:03,021
Yes?

880
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:04,590
I cannot go with you.

881
01:19:04,725 --> 01:19:06,845
Why?

882
01:19:14,348 --> 01:19:18,590
You must be Ranger!
The man with the squint!

883
01:19:18,972 --> 01:19:21,046
Shit!

884
01:19:22,097 --> 01:19:25,214
I need to show you something.

885
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:29,171
Later!

886
01:19:39,638 --> 01:19:44,046
Abahachi is a murderer!
Hold on a sec! Big misunderstanding!

887
01:19:44,096 --> 01:19:50,708
Yes, very big! Chief, no, white palefaces... shit.

888
01:20:05,428 --> 01:20:08,626
We got lucky with
the weather, right?

889
01:20:10,843 --> 01:20:12,870
What are you doing?

890
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:15,002
What should I be doing?

891
01:20:15,051 --> 01:20:19,210
Here's where your plan is wrong!
Well and you can kiss my butt!

892
01:20:36,757 --> 01:20:41,793
I quote: saloon in mint condition,
quiet fee... quiet location...

893
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,048
Once again: we had an appointment
with a realtor from Wyoming.

894
01:20:46,088 --> 01:20:50,830
Shortly before I read his ad in the paper.
I quote: saloon in mint condition,

895
01:20:50,882 --> 01:20:55,289
No fees... available immediately...
Can't be! Cut!

896
01:21:10,213 --> 01:21:15,831
Did you hear that? A man
got hit with a stone...

897
01:21:16,586 --> 01:21:21,789
But boss! It's John.
Remember, you sent him to bed?

898
01:21:22,337 --> 01:21:24,410
Ah, right!

899
01:21:25,378 --> 01:21:28,495
l am a clucking hen...

900
01:21:29,501 --> 01:21:34,206
I used to own a beauty farm.
Really quite cozy.

901
01:21:34,251 --> 01:21:37,369
Wouldn't have hurt you either.

902
01:21:37,544 --> 01:21:41,702
And this is Uschi.
What a woman!

903
01:21:50,417 --> 01:21:53,368
Ow! You crazy?

904
01:22:06,168 --> 01:22:09,281
Final cut!

905
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:46,266
Oh my, oh my, oh my...

906
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:51,616
See, Jacqueline, that's
what you get from that.

907
01:23:51,672 --> 01:23:54,734
So much effort and then
they all just go home.

908
01:23:57,584 --> 01:24:00,408
We're probably stuck with
the cake again.

909
01:24:00,461 --> 01:24:04,084
Too bad about the prosecco.
They are such ignorants.

910
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:07,700
They don't even know how hard
it is to get a Prosecco around here.

911
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:12,445
Don't even mention the ice!

912
01:24:12,501 --> 01:24:17,279
And if you don't have firewater,
all hell is let lose.

913
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,003
Just like with the floaties I got
for Abahachi back in the day.

914
01:24:24,207 --> 01:24:28,934
First he had to have them.
Two weeks later he didn't care anymore.

915
01:24:29,788 --> 01:24:34,512
Say, have we taken the wrong path?
I think we need to go left.

916
01:24:36,067 --> 01:24:39,074
Jacqueline, not so fast!
Or you'll barf again!
