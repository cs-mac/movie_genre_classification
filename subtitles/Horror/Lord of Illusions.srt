{500}{750}Lord of Illusions
{5132}{5178}Swann.
{5330}{5418}And the fire said to me...
{5512}{5558}" Nix, Nix,
{5560}{5616}you are my instrument.
{5642}{5707}From now on you shall be known...
{5709}{5744}as...
{5791}{5834}the Puritan.
{5858}{5930}You will find a few good men...
{5932}{5968}and women...
{6019}{6077}and together...
{6114}{6160}together...
{6212}{6271}you will cleanse the world. "
{6344}{6387}Master.
{6460}{6506}Swann's here.
{6862}{6908}Are we ready?
{6952}{7019}- Ready.|- Maybe we should think about this.
{7021}{7083}He's gone too far.
{7084}{7123}So he took a kid.
{7124}{7162}He's gonna kill her.
{7164}{7219}He could drive us crazy.
{7220}{7271}So stay out here!
{7404}{7455}Please get away from me.
{7590}{7615}Hush!
{7617}{7688}Please don't hurt me!
{7739}{7803}I said, hush.
{7970}{7999}What is it?
{8164}{8224}What's the matter, huh?
{8260}{8290}Please! Please!
{8344}{8403}What are you gonna do to me?
{8517}{8562}Leave me alone!
{8608}{8659}Want me to shoot, Swann?
{8673}{8706}Leave me alone!
{8708}{8762}You don't like him, do you?
{8796}{8871}- He wants her magic.|- Maybe.
{8872}{8923}Go! Fetch him.
{9030}{9088}I think he's in love.
{9196}{9242}If you see the kid, yell.
{9381}{9422}- Quaid.|- Hey, man.
{9441}{9484}It's Quaid.
{9567}{9623}I thought you weren't|coming back.
{9644}{9690}I changed my mind.
{9760}{9816}You can't leave, man.
{9818}{9864}He won't let you.
{10511}{10557}You're gonna be okay.
{10559}{10591}Okay?
{10951}{10992}I knew you'd come.
{11020}{11091}I've got so much power|to give you, Swann.
{11118}{11164}All you have to do...
{11190}{11220}is beg.
{11265}{11295}Fuck you.
{11297}{11380}You don't think|that I've got it to give?
{11420}{11460}You're wrong!
{11541}{11627}I could eat your fucking soul!
{11855}{11912}Now be a good girl.
{11981}{12008}Fuck!
{12010}{12063}Stay here.
{12065}{12130}- Jennifer, are you okay?|- Jesus!
{12192}{12246}Stay away.
{12248}{12294}Stay the fuck away.
{12524}{12563}Are you okay?
{12600}{12647}How would you like...
{12672}{12706}to see the world...
{12708}{12763}the way it really is?
{12764}{12840}You wanna see flesh...|with a god's eyes?
{13573}{13608}Swann?
{13633}{13668}Here he is.
{13740}{13790}Take a look, Swann.
{13862}{13915}These are your friends.
{14429}{14498}What have you done to him?
{14531}{14584}- Swann--|- Don't touch me!
{14586}{14640}He got into my head!
{14684}{14734}You wanna be like that, Swann?
{14776}{14847}Mud? Shit?
{14888}{14949}Come here.
{15005}{15071}Share the power.
{15834}{15863}Swann.
{15881}{15913}Help me.
{16145}{16183}Bag.
{16351}{16397}Help me.
{16399}{16467}- What are you doing?|- Binding you.
{16469}{16520}You piece of shit!
{16793}{16860}This isn't over, Swann.
{16960}{16985}This isn't finished.
{18173}{18208}Dead?
{18297}{18331}Dead.
{18373}{18415}What now?
{18448}{18502}We bury him so deep...
{18534}{18593}no one will ever find him.
{20623}{20693}I been calling you|for three days, Harry.
{20695}{20741}I missed you too, Loomis.
{20769}{20816}You got a beer?
{21025}{21074}I got a job for you...
{21076}{21148}if you can tear yourself away|from all this weird shit.
{21149}{21214}You need a woman's touch|in here.
{21216}{21283}Why don't you get yourself|a secretary?
{21285}{21325}On what you pay me?
{21351}{21388}So get married.
{21440}{21480}Tried that.
{21481}{21516}Oh, yeah.
{21544}{21621}" Harry D'Amour, who describes himself|as a private detective...
{21622}{21699}has been linked with occult activities|on several occasions.
{21701}{21801}'We regard D'Amour|as a highly dubious character...'
{21803}{21834}quoted one source. "
{21860}{21894}That's nice, Harry.
{21932}{21972}It's all bullshit.
{22009}{22062}It was on TV last night.
{22064}{22129}You looked like shit,|by the way.
{22131}{22176}- Thanks.|- What's the story?
{22177}{22224}Was the kid really possessed?
{22309}{22343}Probably.
{22434}{22471}By what?
{22498}{22553}You know.
{22555}{22589}The usual.
{22617}{22672}You need a vacation.
{22692}{22753}Somewhere sunny, like...
{22755}{22787}L.A.
{22789}{22843}That's where the job is?
{22870}{22940}Guy's name's Tapert.|Big insurance fraud.
{22941}{23013}He's gone west to spend|his ill-gotten gains.
{23040}{23076}It's worth ten grand...
{23077}{23124}if you catch him doing it.
{23125}{23152}If I don't?
{23183}{23209}Catch a tan.
{23257}{23316}I need someone of your caliber|on this, Harry.
{23489}{23544}Taste the darkness, D'Amour.
{23545}{23587}It's been waiting for you.
{23689}{23786}Yeah, well, maybe I do|need a vacation.
{23788}{23818}You'll like L.A.
{23820}{23894}There's great weather,|great women.
{24463}{24512}- Here you go.|- Thanks. Have a nice evening.
{24514}{24549}You bet.
{24660}{24697}Hello, L.A.
{25001}{25038}9:18 p.m.
{25087}{25143}Tapert's paying by the hour.
{25145}{25192}He's getting his money's worth.
{25477}{25552}Come here, you fuckers!|Come on in!
{25725}{25756}Wait a minute.
{25757}{25804}He's late for something.
{29373}{29419}What the hell?
{29687}{29733}Ever watched a man die?
{29785}{29833}If you watch very closely...
{29835}{29918}you can sometimes|see the soul escaping.
{30000}{30066}And if you're very quick...
{30068}{30105}you can catch it.
{30189}{30234}I wasn't there.
{30314}{30360}Ask Pimm.
{30362}{30396}Pimm's dead.
{30451}{30510}Jennifer Desiderio's|disappeared.
{30573}{30646}They knew the Puritan|was coming home.
{30648}{30690}So did you.
{31381}{31415}Wait.
{31417}{31451}Don't leave me.
{31712}{31763}Did you come for a reading?
{31919}{31945}My God.
{31947}{31990}What?
{31991}{32069}You are drawn|to the dark side...
{32107}{32154}over and over.
{32173}{32211}You don't like that.
{32213}{32247}Not much.
{32287}{32352}You can't change it.
{32354}{32419}You must walk the line...
{32421}{32467}between heaven and hell.
{32515}{32562}It is your destiny.
{32588}{32623}Accept it.
{32703}{32750}Hang on.
{32771}{32817}I'm not afraid to die.
{32932}{32996}There's something terrible...
{32998}{33066}coming home soon.
{33091}{33116}The Puritan?
{33213}{33257}Who is he?
{33403}{33437}Shit.
{33919}{33966}What were you doing up here?
{33967}{34002}I'm a private detective.
{34003}{34098}I was hired to follow a guy|named Tapert for a couple of days.
{34099}{34164}- Insurance fraud.|- Tapert.
{34166}{34233}So now I've got Tapert,|Butterfield--
{34235}{34293}Tapert's got nothin'|to do with this.
{34295}{34353}He just came|to get his palm read.
{34419}{34466}This is something else.
{34508}{34567}You ever heard of somebody|called the Puritan?
{34568}{34615}New one on me.|Let's see him.
{34671}{34705}Where the fuck is he?
{34707}{34751}He got up and walked.
{34782}{34852}After that fall,|he would've broken half his bones.
{34895}{34954}I don't think|he'd have given a shit.
{35063}{35095}D'Amour.
{35096}{35159}Why do I know that name?
{35187}{35238}I know him.
{35239}{35299}I saw him on TV.
{35301}{35379}Some kid got possessed,|and he saved the little bastard's life.
{35399}{35443}A priest?
{35631}{35690}He's just some guy...
{35691}{35745}who's got a nose for this shit.
{35775}{35818}Like you.
{35900}{35947}I don't want him|getting in the way.
{35949}{35989}He won't.
{36059}{36110}We've, all of us,|waited too long...
{36112}{36178}to have the homecoming spoiled.
{36232}{36289}What do you mean,|" all of us " ?
{36291}{36358}A lot of people|believed in Nix.
{36359}{36418}They haven't forgotten|his promise.
{36484}{36515}About?
{36517}{36551}Death.
{36580}{36615}What about death?
{36724}{36780}It's an illusion.
{37420}{37461}Coffee, Mrs. Swann?
{37463}{37509}Yes, thank you.
{37560}{37590}Where's Mr. Swann?
{37592}{37630}In his study.
{37632}{37691}He got something on his mind?
{38040}{38086}Hey. Mr. Sunshine.
{38219}{38266}That's what I'm gonna call you.
{38328}{38369}Bad show?
{38486}{38516}The usual.
{38518}{38573}Full house.
{38575}{38617}Standing ovation.
{38619}{38659}I tell them it's magic.
{38661}{38703}They believe you.
{38705}{38739}Yeah.
{38871}{38911}Remember Quaid?
{38954}{38988}Sure.
{39081}{39127}I think they killed him.
{39215}{39246}Oh, God.
{39297}{39345}I just saw him too.
{39551}{39602}I'm putting in|a new illusion tonight.
{39639}{39701}Something special.|I want you to be there.
{39824}{39861}Of course.
{39895}{39966}You want me|to find out about Quaid?
{39967}{40020}- I mean, the funeral?|- No.
{40112}{40161}I'm not going anywhere near him.
{40524}{40557}Higher.
{40629}{40662}Another inch.
{40688}{40751}The left hand side is too low.
{40792}{40818}Valentin?
{40888}{40942}Good. There.
{41044}{41081}Yes?
{41121}{41191}I want you to find|this man D'Amour for me.
{41509}{41539}Shit.
{41714}{41758}Mr. D'Amour.
{41760}{41794}Go away.
{41829}{41875}It's 1:00 in the afternoon.
{41877}{41929}Who are you, my mother?
{41958}{42032}I'm here to offer you|a job, Mr. D'Amour.
{42088}{42139}I'm going back to New York.
{42190}{42275}Have you got something in New York|that'll pay you 5,000 a day?
{42502}{42549}Do I get lunch?
{42551}{42603}Whose car?
{42605}{42641}Mine.
{42643}{42726}No, it's not.|You're driving it too carefully.
{42727}{42786}Maybe I just bought it.
{42816}{42886}Well, somebody's been|smoking in here for months.
{43058}{43092}Havanas.
{43134}{43168}You're not the smoker.
{43198}{43233}So, who is?
{43266}{43330}You'd almost pass|for a detective, D'Amour.
{43365}{43443}I work for the best illusionist|in the world.
{43474}{43532}- Philip Swann?|- You know of him?
{43561}{43607}Kinda hard to miss him.
{43609}{43657}I saw him perform once|in Vegas.
{43659}{43706}Are you a gambling man?
{43787}{43830}Swann is quite a magician.
{43831}{43888}Never call him that.
{43890}{43934}He's strictly an illusionist.
{43936}{43970}What's the difference?
{44063}{44108}Illusions...
{44110}{44144}are trickery.
{44201}{44247}Magicians do it for real.
{44311}{44362}Where'd the flower go?
{44635}{44682}Any movie stars buried here?
{44706}{44746}Probably.
{44748}{44811}It's not a bad place.|It's warm, lots of palm trees.
{44813}{44883}I don't think the dead|much care.
{44885}{44919}You sure?
{44960}{45006}- Are you a believer, then?|- Oh, yeah.
{45008}{45078}I signed on for all of them|in my time.
{45080}{45153}Catholic, Hindu, Moonies.
{45192}{45238}You can't have|too many saviors.
{45357}{45410}Who's that?
{45412}{45467}Swann's wife.
{45671}{45742}I want you to help me|help my husband.
{45743}{45862}He's in some kind of trouble-- something|to do with the man you saw murdered.
{45886}{45968}I think Philip believes|all that stuff with the tarot cards.
{45997}{46031}And you don't?
{46058}{46117}I think we make|our own futures.
{46171}{46222}So, what's the connection?
{46224}{46274}I don't exactly know.
{46276}{46341}Philip doesn't like to talk|about the past.
{46342}{46377}Why not?
{46488}{46539}He's a secretive man.
{46597}{46643}And you don't ask questions?
{46696}{46766}We don't share our lives|the way a lot of people do.
{46768}{46839}But obviously|you still care about him.
{46841}{46911}We wouldn't be having|this conversation if I didn't.
{46970}{47041}Swann is one of the most|remarkable men alive.
{47098}{47137}You don't believe me?
{47158}{47231}He's an illusionist.|That's not exactly brain surgery.
{47258}{47304}I'm sorry. You asked.
{47378}{47441}No, you're right.
{47478}{47539}He could've been something more.
{47541}{47576}Maybe a lot more.
{47613}{47697}But sometimes people get lost.|Even good people.
{47699}{47787}- Too much money, too much fame.|- Where do I sign up?
{47863}{47909}Will you take the job,|Mr. D'Amour?
{47936}{47997}- Harry.|- Harry.
{48020}{48078}When do you want me to start?
{48079}{48137}Come to the show with me.
{48138}{48197}It's his last performance|in L.A. tonight.
{48234}{48326}I want you to see him with an audience.|They love him.
{48351}{48377}Do you?
{48419}{48490}I didn't marry him for love,|Mr. D'Amour.
{48517}{48567}- Tonight?|- Sure.
{48602}{48637}Okay.
{49897}{49931}Excuse me.
{49985}{50016}Sorry.
{50113}{50160}- I'm glad you could make it.|- Are you kidding?
{50161}{50208}This is a big deal for me.
{50237}{50296}I gotta have the tux back|by midnight.
{50358}{50389}Valentin!
{50489}{50524}I'm here.
{50556}{50641}The guy with Dorothea--|is that him?
{50875}{50934}- Check if he's ready.|- Ready?
{50964}{50998}Ready.
{51705}{51769}How the fuck does he do that?
{51771}{51807}It's wires.
{51809}{51884}- I don't see no wires.|- So, what is it? Magic?
{51940}{51982}Ladies and gentlemen...
{51984}{52078}you are standing on the threshold|of a miracle.
{54506}{54578}Come with me|into the great beyond.
{54689}{54723}He's good.
{54725}{54771}You haven't seen anything yet.
{55408}{55461}This is the new illusion.
{56706}{56771}Have you seen this before?
{57008}{57053}There's something wrong here.
{58333}{58384}For God's sake!
{58386}{58416}Wait! Who are you?
{58477}{58506}Oh, God.
{58587}{58613}Please.
{58707}{58749}Please, Dorothea.
{58783}{58817}Come away.
{58819}{58857}It's no use.
{60197}{60249}I got you, you fucker!
{60475}{60512}Who did this, D'Amour?
{60514}{60552}Who killed Swann?
{60572}{60606}You did.
{60631}{60672}Didn't you?
{60674}{60700}Why would I?
{60702}{60746}Beats me.
{60748}{60818}You don't have a clue|what you're into, do you?
{60820}{60849}I feel it!
{60850}{60890}Deep shit?
{60990}{61021}Who did this?
{61080}{61114}It was...
{61142}{61168}It was...
{63307}{63365}And this Butterfield guy?
{63366}{63393}Vanished.
{63424}{63505}Another fucking magician.|Jesus.
{63548}{63594}You through with me?
{63643}{63679}For now.
{63681}{63741}You planning on moving back|to New York?
{63778}{63813}No, not yet.
{64362}{64409}- They treating you all right?|- Yeah.
{64492}{64540}I heard what happened.
{64542}{64614}I think I'm gonna|stick around for a while.
{64616}{64681}Maybe dig in places|that cops wouldn't look.
{64712}{64774}I wouldn't know|where you'd start.
{64776}{64830}Maybe with the other illusionists?
{64850}{64896}They won't tell you anything.
{64918}{64965}I can be very persuasive.
{65044}{65074}Yeah.
{65109}{65155}I think you probably can.
{66023}{66053}Scotch on the rocks.
{66130}{66166}Where did you learn that?
{66168}{66246}Oh, this stuff?|At birth.
{66301}{66412}Are you a professional, or did you|just come here to watch the shows?
{66414}{66461}A bit of both.
{66462}{66542}I know most of the young kids|who are coming up...
{66543}{66578}but didn't recognize you.
{66579}{66626}Well, I'm in from New York.
{66654}{66701}I came out to see Swann.
{66746}{66797}Yeah, Swann. Swann.
{66826}{66872}Jeez, that was a tragedy.
{66899}{67002}The general thinking around this place|was that it was just a question of time.
{67022}{67069}He was taking a lot of risks?
{67070}{67106}You'd better believe it.
{67108}{67168}A lot of risks.
{67170}{67221}My name's Walter Wilder,|by the way.
{67246}{67277}Not the Walter Wilder.
{67278}{67342}Dear boy,|the one and the only.
{67371}{67442}Take a couple of cards|and try this nonsense.
{67535}{67609}If you knew Swann,|you must have known Vinovich.
{67636}{67662}Yeah.
{67664}{67749}Vinovich knew Swann|way, way back.
{67751}{67840}He said there were a lot of drugs|around, a lot of crazy shit.
{67842}{67929}Let me ask you something...|Walter.
{67949}{68034}I'd love to hang|with you guys for a while.
{68060}{68140}Magicians are|a pretty cagey bunch.
{68187}{68268}I suppose it's a question of|who do you know?
{68286}{68333}Actually, nobody.
{68410}{68476}Well, you do now.
{68538}{68633}Now, down here is|what they call the repository.
{68666}{68710}Behind those locked doors...
{68711}{68802}lies every secret of magic|known to mankind.
{68822}{68872}- Ever been in there?|- Me? No.
{68874}{68930}No, there are only three keys.
{68931}{68986}Vinovich has got one,|of course.
{69012}{69068}It is more than entertainment.
{69070}{69132}We are opening up people's heads.
{69134}{69249}We are bringing miracles|back into their miserable little lives.
{69250}{69298}But they're fake miracles.
{69300}{69366}Houdini believed|he had spirit guides.
{69368}{69402}Do you believe that?
{69403}{69438}I believe...
{69439}{69509}that we walk a narrow path...
{69510}{69561}between--
{69563}{69594}Heaven and hell?
{69596}{69634}Divinity and trickery.
{69679}{69733}So then, sometimes...
{69734}{69797}the miracles are real.
{69799}{69847}No. They are always fake.
{69849}{69930}The saints, the messiahs,|they were just illusionists.
{69931}{69978}You could walk on water?
{69980}{70098}I can reproduce any miracle|that has ever been performed...
{70099}{70142}with a little preparation.
{70159}{70201}Even one of Swann's?
{70260}{70318}- They were no damn good.|- Really?
{70320}{70384}That's funny.|I heard he was one of the best.
{70386}{70456}If he was so good,|why is he so dead?
{70506}{70534}You tell me.
{70624}{70676}I figured|you'd have some theory.
{70678}{70722}I have many theories.
{70723}{70781}I'd like to hear one of them.
{70838}{70884}I'm not saying another word.
{70886}{70945}You damn fool, Wilder.
{70946}{70988}This man is a journalist.
{70990}{71078}No, I'm not a journalist.|I just wanted to know about Swann.
{71080}{71129}He was a freak.
{71131}{71186}Everything he did was tainted.
{71188}{71244}- With what?|- Evil!
{71246}{71306}He was evil.
{71362}{71396}Are you coming?
{71482}{71589}Do not speak to this man|if you wish to keep my company.
{71590}{71644}That's a great accent.|What is it, Brooklyn?
{71646}{71684}Fuck you, all right?
{72099}{72133}Harry.
{72644}{72696}I've got to be careful.
{72698}{72787}- If Vinovich sees me talking to you--|- What do you want, Billy?
{72789}{72836}I heard a name.
{72863}{72909}Someone they talk about|in whispers.
{72911}{72944}Who?
{72971}{73001}Nix.
{73068}{73153}He's dead now,|but I think maybe he taught Swann.
{73155}{73207}Who's doing the talking?
{73209}{73253}Vinovich.
{73255}{73301}But you burned|your bridges there.
{73404}{73436}This is me.
{73468}{73498}Good luck.
{73564}{73610}I loved what you did in there.
{73740}{73772}What are you looking at?
{74027}{74121}I just want to know what Philip saw in|those cards and stop it from happening.
{74229}{74276}Divinity and trickery.
{74403}{74473}Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.
{75226}{75260}I know it's late.
{75292}{75326}It's okay.
{75365}{75403}How'd it go today?
{75443}{75510}Went up to the Magic Castle.
{75544}{75626}You were right. He didn't|have a lot of friends up there.
{75628}{75666}They were jealous of him.
{75692}{75730}Why?|Because he had you?
{75786}{75844}He didn't have me.|I told you.
{75845}{75901}Yeah, you didn't marry him|for love.
{75903}{75951}So, why did you marry him?
{75953}{76000}That's none of your business,|Harry.
{76054}{76127}You ever hear of somebody|called Nix?
{76224}{76264}Dorothea?
{76402}{76448}Yeah, I'm here.
{76475}{76521}I don't know the name.
{76523}{76577}What about Jennifer Desiderio?
{76609}{76656}It doesn't ring a bell.
{76673}{76699}I have to go.
{76701}{76736}That's it?
{76780}{76850}All right.|Look, I'll keep digging.
{76852}{76910}Yeah. You do that.
{77251}{77321}" Keep Out|Police Department "
{77781}{77843}Ever watched a man die?
{78836}{78874}Yes.
{79148}{79199}" Desiderio. "
{79518}{79562}What are you doing here?
{79564}{79610}Looking for you.
{79612}{79690}- I tried the hotel.|- So why you'd come here?
{79692}{79754}You're a detective|with no clues.
{79756}{79802}Where else would you look?
{79840}{79879}Do you mind?
{79917}{79952}I'll keep this brief.
{79985}{80036}Here's $30,000.
{80076}{80104}What for?
{80106}{80144}A ticket home.
{80170}{80271}You didn't hire me. She did. She wants|me to stop, I wanna hear it from her.
{80273}{80342}- She doesn't want to see you.|- No?
{80344}{80407}- People are dying here.|- Yes.
{80409}{80473}It's a terrible tragedy.
{80475}{80529}Is that all you have to say?
{80555}{80605}It's a fucking terrible tragedy?
{80636}{80706}- I want to know why.|- Why people die?
{80806}{80888}Give it up, D'Amour.|Go home.
{80960}{81014}Don't try to see her, D'Amour.
{81016}{81067}Just leave her alone.
{81069}{81120}Lock up, will you?
{81159}{81223}Jennifer has only ever had|one visitor.
{81225}{81285}- Mr. Quaid?|- Right.
{81307}{81374}- He's dead, isn't he?|- Yeah.
{81375}{81423}Heard it on the news.
{81425}{81471}Jennifer doesn't know...
{81473}{81540}and frankly, this isn't|the best time for her to be told.
{81542}{81583}I won't say anything.
{81622}{81715}She's been with us for four years|and she was coming along nicely.
{81747}{81802}Past month she's been|worst than ever.
{81803}{81886}- What's her problem?|- She has no real grip on reality.
{81907}{81972}- Does anybody?|- Oh, yes.
{81974}{82063}We have to agree on what's real and not.|That's what holds us together.
{82087}{82141}What does Jennifer think|is real?
{82143}{82192}She thinks the devil's|coming for her.
{82279}{82325}Have we met before?
{82379}{82420}Only I forget.
{82488}{82586}They give me pills, you know,|to make me even.
{82587}{82631}And I...
{82633}{82677}I forget things.
{82679}{82715}You didn't forget me.
{82794}{82884}I just came to see if you remembered|a man named Butterfield.
{82977}{83020}Maybe. I...
{83131}{83217}That's okay.|What about Philip Swann?
{83315}{83348}I knew Swann.
{83419}{83454}He's a fucking liar.
{83456}{83493}Why is that?
{83495}{83542}He said he knew|how to protect us.
{83563}{83609}But he didn't know anything.
{83657}{83716}He made us think|it was over and done with.
{83718}{83757}What was?
{83847}{83895}I don't wanna think about it.
{83896}{83947}If I think about it, he'll...
{83949}{83995}he'll hear me.
{83997}{84039}He'll find me.
{84040}{84085}Swann?
{84087}{84134}I told you. I don't want...
{84319}{84351}What is it?
{84352}{84390}Calm down.
{84442}{84478}No, he'll get me!
{84479}{84535}He's not-- He's not--
{84589}{84631}Who's not gonna get you?
{84632}{84671}Nix. Nix.
{84673}{84722}- And he's the Puritan?|- Yes!
{84778}{84828}- And he's dead?|- No.
{84830}{84877}He's coming back.
{84879}{84930}He's digging his way out.
{84932}{84996}I'll take care of her now.
{85338}{85376}Jesus.
{87863}{87904}Swann Residence.
{87906}{87959}I wanna talk to Dorothea.
{87960}{88012}I'm afraid she's not home.
{88014}{88056}When will she be home?
{88082}{88124}Who is it?
{88170}{88206}Crank call.
{88267}{88314}I'll get the number changed.
{88335}{88386}No word from D'Amour yet?
{88388}{88428}It's better he's gone.
{88430}{88492}He would have done|more harm than good.
{88527}{88598}Better for whom? Me?
{88599}{88634}I don't think so.
{88675}{88719}Try him again at the hotel.
{88914}{88971}- This is Billy.|- Billy.
{88973}{89023}Harry D'Amour.
{89025}{89070}Listen.
{89071}{89162}Supposing I wanted to get into|the repository at the Magic Castle.
{89233}{89271}There we go.
{89329}{89380}You done something|like this before?
{89382}{89423}I've had my moments.
{89457}{89495}Hold that up.
{89584}{89640}- They've gotta have this place rigged.|- How?
{89642}{89688}It'll be something hokey.
{90174}{90207}Whoa!
{90273}{90319}Let's have a look around.
{91170}{91239}Butterfield's pal had this|carved on his forehead.
{91241}{91287}Any idea what it is?
{91334}{91368}Nope.
{91680}{91753}What'd I tell you?|So fucking hokey.
{91886}{91921}What have we got here?
{92113}{92161}- Get the files.|- Fuck the files.
{92163}{92228}Billy, get the files!
{92284}{92321}Go on!
{92510}{92536}Jesus!
{92562}{92599}I could have lost|my fucking hands!
{92667}{92726}That would have kept you|out of the magic circle...
{92727}{92818}which was presumably|the idea.
{92851}{92893}Why don't you take|a look through these?
{92939}{92974}Go on.
{93222}{93256}These must be about Nix.
{93285}{93314}The Puritan?
{93473}{93502}Look at that.
{93504}{93540}A Nix specialty?
{93589}{93636}I don't know|any of these tricks.
{93675}{93717}Maybe they're not tricks.
{93797}{93874}What did Vinovich say? Something|about walking the path between--
{93875}{93929}Trickery and divinity.|He's saying that all the time.
{93930}{93980}He said that because he knew.
{93982}{94026}Son of a bitch.
{94027}{94073}He'd seen these and he knew.
{94074}{94102}Knew what?
{94841}{94901}Get it off of me!|Where the fuck are you?
{94902}{94944}Hold it right there.
{94966}{95024}I said hold it--
{95538}{95578}Hokey enough for you?
{95663}{95710}I'm out of here, man.
{95806}{95845}Comin'?
{95846}{95881}Yeah.
{95906}{95952}I'm comin'.
{96140}{96176}I can't let you in.
{96534}{96581}This is the way he wanted it.
{96638}{96673}No autopsy...
{96710}{96742}no embalming...
{96814}{96864}nobody meddling with his body.
{96929}{96981}" Flesh is a trap, "|he used to say.
{97010}{97048}" Flesh is a trap...
{97113}{97162}and magic sets us free. "
{97232}{97268}Why did you come back?
{97307}{97359}I've been doing some digging.
{97361}{97400}What did you find?
{97486}{97554}Jennifer Desiderio, for one.
{97608}{97674}She threw herself in front|of a car this afternoon.
{97791}{97846}Why don't you tell me|the truth?
{98006}{98060}Nix ran some kind|of a cult, right?
{98098}{98173}Some kind of|a Charlie Manson deal?
{98174}{98230}It was more than that, I think.
{98258}{98305}He was the real thing,|wasn't he?
{98306}{98347}Swann said he could do stuff.
{98376}{98417}Like?
{98418}{98478}He could levitate,|juggle fire...
{98510}{98584}and he could get|into people's heads...
{98587}{98628}make them see things.
{98630}{98683}- Terrible things.|- What things?
{98684}{98741}I don't know.
{98741}{98838}- And he taught some of this to Swann?|- Yes, some of it.
{98841}{98926}So then, Swann wasn't|performing illusions.
{98927}{98965}He was doing magic.
{98984}{99017}Yes.
{99018}{99108}What? You thought he should be|using it to cure cancer...
{99110}{99142}instead of making millions?
{99205}{99273}- Look, I told you.|- Right. I know. Too much fame.
{99275}{99353}That'd be enough to turn|anybody's head, including yours.
{99354}{99384}Oh, fuck you.
{99386}{99442}You're the one who said|you weren't with him for love.
{99443}{99486}I wasn't.
{99488}{99524}Then what?
{99570}{99624}What the hell was going on here?
{99697}{99766}- I was grateful to him.|- For what?
{99767}{99840}Everything I had|I owed to him.
{100021}{100059}And he loved me.
{100090}{100150}He couldn't always show it,|but he felt it.
{100152}{100212}He thought Nix was coming back,|didn't he?
{100336}{100374}Didn't he?
{100451}{100515}I can't help you|unless you talk to me!
{100544}{100614}- You can't help me.|- You don't know that!
{100968}{101019}Nothing's gonna happen to you.
{101090}{101127}Nothing?
{101193}{101239}Nothing you don't want.
{103523}{103561}I was so afraid.
{103640}{103672}Don't be.
{103721}{103767}Nix can't hurt you now.
{103804}{103840}Are you sure?
{103842}{103880}Yeah.
{103913}{103939}He's dead.
{104067}{104107}I know.
{104148}{104194}I was the one who shot him.
{104260}{104296}I was 12.
{104325}{104414}Nix took me hostage|to get Swann to come to him.
{104452}{104490}And they all came.
{104526}{104583}- Yeah.|- Quaid and Jennifer and--
{104584}{104632}Swann and Pimm.
{104760}{104790}What was that?
{104925}{104963}Valentin?
{105093}{105131}Wait!
{105547}{105577}What the hell?
{105838}{105900}It's him. It's Nix.
{105944}{105986}Dorothea, stay there.
{107814}{107858}Find Valentin!
{107894}{107961}Find him and get him in here.|Now!
{108140}{108172}This is sacrilege.
{108245}{108295}Are you satisfied now?
{108369}{108432}Don't worry.|I'm not hurting him.
{108564}{108627}Looks like you're not|a widow after all.
{108764}{108802}Sit down.
{108903}{108958}You rigged the illusion|to fail, right?
{108960}{108990}Yes.
{109016}{109055}You set up the fake body?
{109109}{109147}And then what?
{109186}{109274}Because I was getting too close|to something or someone...
{109276}{109332}you called Swann?
{109333}{109395}No. First I tried|to pay you off.
{109444}{109493}Was it Swann's idea?
{109538}{109571}It was mine.
{109597}{109647}I didn't want any more bloodshed.
{109649}{109739}That's why we went to all this trouble.|So Nix would have no one to come after.
{109741}{109828}Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake!|What is wrong with you people?
{109830}{109912}Haven't you seen enough|to know that doesn't matter?
{109957}{110041}I want to meet with Swann|face to face.
{110044}{110129}Why can't you just|let this alone?
{110130}{110184}Let everyone think it's over.
{110295}{110333}Maybe he's right.
{110372}{110438}Maybe we should just|let him stay dead.
{112947}{112993}Couldn't stay away, could you?
{113174}{113231}Had to see who cried over you|the most, huh?
{113279}{113322}You know...
{113323}{113421}a lot of people are gonna be pissed off|when they find out you're still alive.
{113594}{113641}And they will, you know.
{113683}{113766}No matter how much shit you|bury yourself under, you're gonna--
{114051}{114110}You shouldn't have followed me.
{114135}{114175}How do you do that?
{114199}{114235}Now I'm going to|have to kill you.
{114237}{114272}I don't think so.
{114298}{114335}You need me alive.
{114338}{114408}Why? So you can fuck|the woman I love?
{114411}{114487}If you love her so much,|why did you widow her?
{114897}{114940}What a waste.
{114942}{114996}You can do shit that most of us|can only dream about.
{115031}{115097}Then you go around pretending|it's just some trick.
{115116}{115194}Illusionists get|Las Vegas contracts.
{115221}{115267}Magicians get burned.
{115269}{115313}Yeah, or murdered like Nix.
{115315}{115394}Oh, he deserved it.
{115396}{115454}Maybe he doesn't feel that way.
{115455}{115541}Maybe he's digging himself out of|that hole you put him in right now.
{115543}{115593}That's what|you're hiding away from?
{115614}{115653}I did it for Dorothea.
{115679}{115714}Yeah?
{115764}{115863}Now that I'm dead,|the spotlight's off her.
{115864}{115953}- So Nix won't be looking for her.|- I betrayed him.
{115980}{116083}But she shot him. If I'm Nix,|that'd piss me off a little bit.
{116085}{116142}I don't know what else to do.
{116142}{116180}Help me.
{116244}{116277}Look...
{116369}{116433}if Nix is back from the dead...
{116434}{116493}then he is some kind of a god...
{116493}{116560}and he'll find you|wherever the fuck you go.
{116582}{116658}But if he's just another|phony messiah...
{116684}{116762}then you can stage|the greatest comeback in history.
{117451}{117489}Who's there?
{117667}{117702}Easy.
{117938}{117980}I've sometimes thought...
{117981}{118045}if I'd had another profession...
{118078}{118131}I would have been a surgeon.
{118229}{118305}To be able to heal|with one little cut.
{118477}{118553}Say that those eyes of yours|were troubling you.
{118624}{118682}- Please.|- I could just scoop them out.
{118728}{118763}No, don't.
{118765}{118821}Then tell me where Nix is buried.
{118821}{118891}I don't know.
{119110}{119158}Wait! Wait!
{119289}{119318}I'll tell you.
{119321}{119395}Oh, you'll do more than that.
{121607}{121655}Clemencia?
{122466}{122513}Is there somebody there?
{122982}{123020}I'm-- I'm sorry.
{123021}{123067}Jesus, Valentin!
{123132}{123163}I'm sorry.
{123413}{123474}I can do a lot of shit.
{123476}{123522}But you know that.
{123599}{123647}I like playing|with people's heads.
{123649}{123699}Is that the best you can do?
{123702}{123788}It's important to distract them|from their banality for a few minutes.
{123834}{123902}Doesn't mean much in the end.|They're all gonna die.
{123930}{123969}But you're not?
{124053}{124133}I was going to discover|the secrets of the universe.
{124193}{124239}That's why I liked Nix.
{124268}{124328}He promised me|all these explanations.
{124331}{124384}But he didn't have them.
{124385}{124423}He had something.
{124425}{124493}Showed me how to bend the rules.
{124495}{124551}A little levitation,|a few fireworks.
{124553}{124614}- Is that all?|- No.
{124616}{124725}At the end, when we had him cornered,|he got into my head.
{124725}{124813}Showed me what we really look like|when the veneer's gone.
{124830}{124905}Jelly. Shit.
{124906}{124954}And you believed him?
{124956}{125024}I saw it with|my own fucking eyes!
{125025}{125122}That's his best trick:|No illusions, just the truth.
{125174}{125227}Are you ready for that?
{125470}{125509}I thought not.
{126088}{126129}What is it?
{126346}{126409}Did Dorothea know|where Nix was buried?
{126502}{126546}Did Valentin?
{126547}{126585}Yes.
{126929}{126981}Do you like the look of these?
{127022}{127061}I made them myself...
{127086}{127125}to set him free.
{127156}{127199}Why did you wait so long?
{127201}{127277}I didn't have the skill...
{127278}{127329}to resurrect him...
{127330}{127382}to teach myself.
{127384}{127434}That took time.
{127436}{127519}Think he'll be in a fit state|to resurrect after 13 years?
{127521}{127573}If he was just a man...
{127598}{127653}like me, then no...
{127696}{127774}but he's not.
{127853}{127896}What is he, then?
{127938}{127989}Maybe he'll show you.
{128177}{128211}Anything?
{128244}{128279}Not yet.
{128540}{128609}- If you have lied to me--|- No, I swear!
{128612}{128678}This is the place|Swann told me about.
{128679}{128725}- The rocks--|- Five more minutes.
{128758}{128827}- Are you hearing me?|- I'm doing my best.
{129065}{129111}What have you got there?
{129149}{129183}Fucker!
{129369}{129407}Butterfield!
{129522}{129565}He's in the corner!
{129565}{129608}Don't touch him.
{130010}{130049}It's him.
{130807}{130859}Oh, Jesus Christ!
{131402}{131442}Smell it.
{131514}{131565}He's coming. He's coming.
{131599}{131634}He will come.
{132837}{132889}Help me!
{132921}{132965}Get out of the car.
{132966}{133018}Get out of the fuckin' car!
{133446}{133490}He's got Dorothea.
{133510}{133582}- And Nix?|- Yes.
{133584}{133642}- Don't bother about me.|- Shut up!
{133644}{133690}We've already lost|enough lives.
{133691}{133785}Please accept my apologies,|D'Amour.
{133786}{133818}For what?
{133820}{133892}You're going to lose one more.
{134053}{134081}No!
{134082}{134136}He's better off this way.
{134171}{134219}Nobody's better off this way.
{134221}{134273}You don't get it, do you?
{134354}{134404}This is where we're all goin'.
{134794}{134843}Do you wish him amongst us?
{134845}{134890}Yes.
{134891}{134941}Will you come unto him|upon your knees?
{135005}{135050}Be ready.
{135750}{135830}Listen. You got|everything you want.
{135831}{135867}You don't need me.
{135869}{135951}No, but he will,|after what you did to him.
{135974}{136021}He'll want vengeance.
{138411}{138459}Christ in heaven!
{138541}{138574}My lord.
{138575}{138632}He's coming home.
{138739}{138786}He's with us.
{138787}{138836}He's with us.
{138912}{138952}Hold her!
{139756}{139802}Open your eyes.
{140035}{140073}He's with us.
{140654}{140701}Where is Swann?
{140771}{140833}- He's dead.|- No, he isn't.
{140975}{141015}I swear.
{141359}{141394}Children.
{141510}{141578}Will you suffer to come unto me?
{141968}{142003}Jesus.
{142045}{142096}What the hell|is goin' on in there?
{142125}{142204}At a guess,|they just resurrected him.
{142306}{142341}Fuck!
{142344}{142447}I've come back to bring you|the wisdom of the grave.
{142477}{142538}- Will you hear it?|- Yes.
{142696}{142743}Follow me.
{143015}{143081}Do I know you, child?
{143143}{143178}Yes.
{143214}{143267}I do, don't I?
{143269}{143346}No gun this time, child?
{143431}{143475}Where is Swann?
{143559}{143606}I don't know where he is.
{143699}{143745}He'll come.
{143747}{143844}We have unfinished business,|he and I.
{144522}{144563}This is where we killed him.
{144821}{144876}Looks like you didn't try|hard enough.
{144910}{144970}I can't go any further.
{145094}{145187}Where is she, you fuck, huh?
{145188}{145257}Are you ready for my wisdom?
{145327}{145411}Here is my wisdom.
{145800}{145843}Go! Help her!
{145993}{146059}You see, I escaped|from the grave...
{146060}{146177}so I have to give something|to the grave in return.
{146179}{146232}Yes. Show us.
{146234}{146276}Show us, Puritan.
{146944}{147006}I have to give something back...
{147008}{147070}so I'm giving you.
{147103}{147142}What's happening?
{148038}{148073}Go ahead, bleed.
{148075}{148110}Bleed!
{149427}{149458}What are you doing?
{149671}{149748}You're not worthy.
{149750}{149781}None of you.
{149783}{149830}Fuck you!
{149849}{149942}Only Swann is worthy.
{149963}{150030}You just waited like lambs.
{150350}{150410}I'm not your shepherd.
{151668}{151715}You're not Swann.
{151717}{151757}Who are you?
{151780}{151852}Oh, I know what you want.
{152008}{152046}Hold on!
{152105}{152130}Nix!
{152192}{152242}There you are.
{152244}{152290}Come on!
{152292}{152356}I've had a long time...
{152358}{152399}to think about you.
{152421}{152495}Where did I go wrong?
{152520}{152550}And?
{152552}{152631}I should have been honest|with you from the start.
{152632}{152746}I wasn't born to show people|the error of their ways.
{152748}{152811}I was born...
{152812}{152872}to murder the world.
{152873}{152943}You can still help me do that|if you want.
{152944}{152991}Why would I wanna do that?
{152992}{153083}The lady has a new love|in her life.
{153084}{153162}Your friends are all dead.
{153164}{153225}No one can save you now...
{153227}{153273}but me.
{153392}{153451}- Come on!|- We can't leave him there!
{153515}{153563}I'm not going to!
{153689}{153727}Bitch!
{153774}{153816}Butterfield!
{153818}{153858}Will you help me?
{153897}{153927}Yes.
{153929}{154012}Now you know I will kill you|when we're done. I have to.
{154051}{154104}- Yes.|- But until then...
{154106}{154168}it'll be just the two of us...
{154170}{154228}the way it always was.
{154270}{154290}Yes.
{154421}{154452}Wait.
{154454}{154538}You still feel something|for that bitch?
{154595}{154620}Yes.
{154625}{154654}Will...
{154732}{154771}you...
{154808}{154840}never...
{154892}{154950}learn?
{155328}{155386}She's just flesh...
{155388}{155434}Swannie boy!
{155477}{155515}I'll show you.
{156347}{156417}Where is she?|Where did she go?
{156460}{156526}You've got Swann's disease.
{156528}{156615}You think that with a little courage|and a little love...
{156616}{156673}that it'll all be all right.
{156792}{156882}Tell me where she is|and I'll make it go away.
{157210}{157234}Dig, D'Amour.
{157288}{157322}Touch the darkness.
{157360}{157403}It's been waiting for you.
{157766}{157812}Harry, it's not real.
{157846}{157887}Now listen to me.
{157889}{157926}Look at me!
{157989}{158022}You'll be okay.
{158024}{158092}There you are, child.
{158132}{158176}Come along, child.
{158931}{158975}What are you seeing now?
{159178}{159204}There.
{159933}{159965}One...
{159967}{160003}last...
{160036}{160068}illusion.
{160135}{160183}What's it going to be?
{160185}{160279}- Fire to burn out your eyes?|- Let's go!
{160281}{160354}I'm sure Swann loved your eyes.
{160377}{160463}You shouldn't have taken him|away from me.
{160492}{160564}We were going to be together...
{160566}{160615}when I finished with the world.
{160617}{160672}We were going to keep|each other company...
{160674}{160713}in the dark.
{160848}{160914}But I'm on my own.
{160916}{160983}We're all on our own.
{161020}{161074}The grave is lonely.
{161114}{161170}But living is worse.
{161254}{161300}What the fuck are you?
{161302}{161374}A man who wanted to be a god...
{161414}{161485}then changed his mind.
{161487}{161563}I'm going to be rotten shit|from now on.
{161614}{161650}The car.
{161716}{161763}Can you raise me up like the car?
{161764}{161881}I'm going to show the world|what's waiting at the end.
{161883}{161937}And I am going to make it...
{161969}{162010}despair.
{162834}{162863}Fucker!
{163516}{163560}It's me.
{164439}{164477}Is it finished?
{164558}{164594}I think so.
{165275}{165310}Run.
{165338}{165383}Run!
{166921}{166991}And the fire said to me...
{166992}{167030}said to me...
{167086}{167120}Hush!
{167167}{167275}You will see flesh|with a god's eyes.
{167341}{167414}I was born...
{167415}{167467}to murder the world.
{167613}{167665}" Flesh is a trap. "
{167667}{167713}That's what he used to say.
{167745}{167801}" Flesh is a trap...
{167803}{167858}and magic sets us free. "
