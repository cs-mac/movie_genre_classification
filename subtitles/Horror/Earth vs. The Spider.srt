1
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:01,201
Everybody, l woke up
and l said, "You go to hell."

2
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,804
I can't do anything.
I don't have any power. I'm nothing.

3
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:08,238
I'm nothing.

4
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,167
Yo, Willie. You okay?

5
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,083
Very nice. Thanks.
Morning to you too.

6
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:24,489
Hey, come on! Get back here, bitch!

7
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:53,368
Thor, you ever wish
you had another hand?

8
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,162
See you, buddy.

9
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,238
Hey, Quentin.

10
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,605
Hey, Stephanie. How are you?

11
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:54,004
I'm fine. Going to work?

12
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,484
Yeah. Paying the rent.

13
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,562
Can you believe
we pay to live here?

14
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,767
-Hi. There's my boy.
-Get back, Thor. I'm sorry.

15
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,042
Come here.
The mighty Thor, god of thunder.

16
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,278
Exactly.

17
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:09,638
Right on.

18
00:05:09,929 --> 00:05:13,001
-See you, Thor.
-Wait, l'll walk you down.

19
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:18,647
-Are you a doctor yet?
-Yeah. You see my Beamer out front?

20
00:05:20,809 --> 00:05:25,087
I'm a nursing student. I moved
here to be close to the hospital.

21
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:28,087
-You're not from here?
-No, a little town.

22
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:32,208
Didn't exactly fit into their mold,
so here l am.

23
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,400
That's too bad.

24
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:38,841
No, it's okay.
Small town, small minds, right?

25
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:42,883
Anyway, l wanted to help people.
They need more help here.

26
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:44,403
Yeah, it's rough here.

27
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:48,887
Yeah. Did you see the front page?
That Midtown creep?

28
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:52,638
Yeah. All those cops,
and they can't catch this guy?

29
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:55,044
I swear, if l was in uniform...

30
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,838
...l would not sleep
until l smashed that insect.

31
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,480
I'm sorry.

32
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,365
It's not right, it makes me mad.
I hate it when the bad guys win.

33
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:15,288
You ever catch
any bad guys at the Bio...?

34
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:20,324
ChemCo? No. I did catch a guy
kicking the snack machine once.

35
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:24,078
-Did you take the perp down?
-Yeah. No, l mean....

36
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:29,323
-Oh, nurse. I got me a pain.
-Kiss and make it all better.

37
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,361
No need to disrespect.

38
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:34,681
Tell me you're not hooking up
with this rent-a-pig.

39
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:39,648
-He just guards her tight little ass.
-You should guard your mouth.

40
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:43,444
-Who's protecting who here?
-You guys just back off.

41
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:48,279
Or what? You'll pull out your gun?
Oh, fuck! He don't have a gun.

42
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:53,838
-He's got his little mace can.
-I'll call the cops.

43
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,238
By the time they get here,
l'll be scraping Renty off my boots.

44
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,328
-Renty, go guard a pile of crap.
-Like the one you crawled out from?

45
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,887
-Clowns.
-You didn't have to do that.

46
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:08,649
-Do what?
-Stick up for me.

47
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:11,886
No, l wasn't sticking up for you, l--

48
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,721
See you later.

49
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:38,008
Get your ass over here.

50
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,879
-Came in last night.
-Oh, man! This is just....

51
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:49,085
I know, dude. It rocks!

52
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,840
But it's 300 dead presidents. Damn!

53
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:55,846
That is a big problem.

54
00:07:56,049 --> 00:08:00,008
Hell, no. Because l'm putting it
on a layaway deal for you.

55
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,087
-Pay me in installments.
-Seriously?

56
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,565
You're my number one
Arachnid Avenger fan.

57
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:10,000
This is so cool.
This morning started out bad.

58
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:12,643
Yeah, yeah. You can blow me later.

59
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:15,841
Okay, so now, check this out.

60
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:23,481
1 .1 of the new graphic novel series.

61
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,517
-I've been waiting for this.
-This kicks ass on anything!

62
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,287
It's got his whole story.

63
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:33,118
How he got injected in Desert Storm
and got his powers.

64
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:34,842
Oh, man.

65
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,843
Look at this!
The way he just cleans house.

66
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:44,008
God, l wish l could do
some of that stuff.

67
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:47,007
This issue is mint.
Do not spooge on this one.

68
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,006
-Don't worry.
-Forget it.

69
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:54,846
I'm giving this pig a double-bagger
and a comic condom.

70
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,687
Morning.

71
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:19,644
-What's up, Papa Nick?
-Hey. How's tricks?

72
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:24,802
-Okay, l guess.
-"Okay"? "Okay"?

73
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:29,287
You're 23, your prostate's the size
of a pea, and you got two good legs.

74
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:33,846
You ungrateful punk. The world
should be great. It's beautiful.

75
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,567
-Want a bite of my sandwich?
-I'm okay.

76
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:42,921
-Bologna with Kalamata olive spread.
-No, thanks.

77
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:46,241
All right, then.
Let's make our rounds, kid.

78
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,201
-So you ask her out this morning?
-Who?

79
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:59,437
Who? Who? The goddess
of the hallway, Stephanie who.

80
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,842
-No, l didn't.
-No?

81
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,440
No. You know, Nick, you can't....

82
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:15,642
There's some girls
that you can't approach like that.

83
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,565
You got a point.
Too bad it's on your head.

84
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:23,642
She's not mean. She's nice.

85
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:28,041
But she's out of my league.
She wouldn't think twice about me.

86
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:31,685
You're a good security cop
at an important lab.

87
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:34,084
You're good at your job.

88
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:38,885
If she doesn't like that,
that's her problem. You're a good kid.

89
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,319
I'm damned proud of you.

90
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:48,687
-So any action today?
-Oh, yeah.

91
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,883
A tech is selling plutonium to Arabs
in lab 5. I got illicit meth in 7.

92
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:58,441
And in 9, Dr. Carson's taking
the longest dump in history.

93
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:05,519
Poor little bastards. Every day
getting sliced and diced. For what?

94
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:08,243
Hey, hey, hey. There's Hairy Larry.

95
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:13,044
Hairy Larry. Nick, you kill me.

96
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:16,837
That baby's new.

97
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:20,240
They must have installed that
last night.

98
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,599
I wonder what it's for.

99
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:28,562
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
That has got to hurt.

100
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:32,364
-What did they do that for?
-I don't know.

101
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:37,165
-Larry must have something special.
-Yeah, makes him invincible.

102
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:40,679
That's why they pump the others
with his mojo juice.

103
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:52,523
Quentin. Hey, Quentin!

104
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:55,607
-What time is it?
-Almost 6.

105
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:59,006
We kept the place safe
one more day.

106
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:02,889
What is with you and these comics?

107
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,445
My kid used to read that crap,
but he was 1 0.

108
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:08,847
I don't know.

109
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,884
I guess they're like dreams.
Colour dreams.

110
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:20,880
There's one guy in the whole world
that has something different.

111
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,958
And there comes this moment when
someone needs exactly what he has...

112
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:31,289
...and he saves them.
He stops the killer and he's a hero.

113
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:36,681
When you read it,
you can imagine you're the guy.

114
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:41,440
I mean, if you had something special.

115
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:44,004
-Don't you have dreams?
-Yeah.

116
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:49,285
Not about guys dressed up like bugs.
They're about Stella Stevens.

117
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,601
-Who?
-Before your time.

118
00:12:55,929 --> 00:13:00,639
They're at it late in Lab 1 0.
Are you ready for one last round?

119
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:03,283
You mind finishing up?
l'll meet you here.

120
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,247
No problem, Nick.

121
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,243
Attention all personnel.
We are closing in five minutes.

122
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:28,918
No.

123
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:30,564
No!

124
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,760
Nick! Turn around! Turn around!

125
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:07,241
-Let the real cops handle this.
-My partner's in there.

126
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,442
-Take no prisoners. Go!
-Wait!

127
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,488
No! Nick! No, no, no. Nick.

128
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:04,607
Poor girl.

129
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:07,687
I was too slow.

130
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:17,283
I should have been here.
I'm sorry.

131
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:43,805
-Your bullshit killed my partner!
-Your bullshit killed my partner.

132
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:47,482
He wasn't worth shit!
You piece-of-shit wannabe!

133
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:52,639
Officer Williams! Go sit
in your cruiser and cool down.

134
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:57,240
I got 1 00 bodies here. Do l have
to referee a playground fight?

135
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,687
Sure thing, Detective Grillo.

136
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:04,839
Get the hell out of here!

137
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:12,400
Are you all right, kid?
l'm Detective lnspector Jack Grillo.

138
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:16,363
I got a lot of questions.
Will you be all right with that?

139
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:21,404
Detective, l'm the facility manager.
You wanted to talk to me.

140
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:25,238
-I'd like your insights.
-I don't understand myself.

141
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,881
We don't have any cash here.
We're a research lab.

142
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,239
What kind of research?

143
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:35,162
Weapons resistance research.

144
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,884
Drug therapies with military ops.
I can't tell you anymore.

145
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:41,597
Can you hang around?
l'll have more questions.

146
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:42,924
Of course.

147
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:48,487
Halloran! Nobody leaves here
without you getting their names.

148
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:51,448
How can you let this happen?

149
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:54,239
Clean out your locker.

150
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,569
-Jeez, l hate spiders.
-Don't!

151
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,081
-Did you see that?
-It's the guy who killed his partner.

152
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,925
What did you say?

153
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:16,004
What do you expect,
heroes for 5 bucks an hour?

154
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:25,606
Mojo juice makes them invincible.

155
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:48,645
Yeah, makes them invincible.

156
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,645
Mojo juice makes them invincible.

157
00:19:55,689 --> 00:20:00,046
Okay. Bye. See you later.
See you tomorrow.

158
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:01,608
Okay, bye!

159
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,840
Good night.

160
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:22,118
Oh, my God! Quentin.

161
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,442
Quentin?

162
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:02,842
Hello?

163
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:19,161
Thor. Hi, sweetie. Where's Quentin?

164
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,486
It's Stephanie.

165
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:38,639
I just wanted to see if you're okay.

166
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:03,648
Quentin?

167
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:20,886
Hello?

168
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,645
Are you here?

169
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:04,403
Quentin! Are you okay?
l saw the newspaper.

170
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:09,637
I just wanted to save Nick.
I let them stop me.

171
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:16,287
But all that's gonna change.

172
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:19,686
Oh, God! Let me help you. Okay.

173
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,047
Let me see.

174
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:35,481
I think l have the flu, so you....

175
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:39,238
You can relax. I got my flu shot.

176
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,001
Okay.

177
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:47,647
Here. Sorry. You want to sit down?

178
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:52,238
-I'm sorry it isn't very clean.
-Don't worry about it.

179
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:56,601
With what you've been through,
the break-in and your friend....

180
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,845
Nick, yeah.

181
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:01,407
I'm so sorry.

182
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:08,048
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

183
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:12,481
-We should get you to a hospital now.
-No, no, no, l'm fine.

184
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:15,562
God, you're burning up.

185
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:17,242
Come here.

186
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:26,042
I have to go.

187
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:30,037
-No, it's not what you think.
-I've seen a needle track before.

188
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:34,726
It's not that. I was at work.
It was an accident, l swear.

189
00:24:35,129 --> 00:24:38,087
-I don't even know what it was.
-Okay.

190
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:43,959
Okay, okay.

191
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:50,328
God, that really looks like it hurts.

192
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:57,009
-You don't have to do this.
-Shut up.

193
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:00,599
We're neighbours.
You'd do the same for me, right?

194
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:02,768
Yeah.

195
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:08,881
Whatever you need, l could do it.

196
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,679
Thanks.
So, what did you mean before?

197
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:19,087
-When?
-When you said that's gonna change.

198
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:20,842
It's just....

199
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:25,640
I'm so tired of being a nice guy.

200
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:30,604
I just want to change
into something....

201
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,846
I don't know, something else.

202
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:39,328
I hate to break it to you, but
some people actually like nice guys.

203
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:49,643
You don't have to be a gentleman 24-7.
I can walk myself to the door.

204
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,689
You take care of him, okay?
Good boy.

205
00:25:53,889 --> 00:25:57,438
If you change your mind
about the hospital, l'm next door.

206
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:01,038
And get some rest.

207
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:08,479
Next time l'll ask her out.

208
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,445
Twelve hours.

209
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:03,003
Thor, what are you doing?

210
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:06,322
Excuse me, officer, but that
is disgusting. Tell me more.

211
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:08,724
Soon as l get my handcuffs.

212
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:13,365
-Another round here.
-Make it snappy.

213
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:19,487
-Where did you get that?
-What?

214
00:28:19,689 --> 00:28:22,249
The ink, your arm.

215
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:26,602
That's a beaut.
I got these years ago in the Army.

216
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:30,167
I'll never forget that night.

217
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:33,008
You gotta be some bad-ass
to wear that.

218
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,880
-See that guy at that table?
-What about him?

219
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:43,882
Will he leave with that woman
or by himself?

220
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,045
Let me do you a big favour.

221
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:50,288
There are two reasons why
you don't want nothing to do with her.

222
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:54,846
Reason one: Officer Asshole is
the biggest dickhead on the force.

223
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:59,998
If you fuck with him, l promise
he's gonna hard-core fuck with you.

224
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:02,928
-What's the other reason?
-Her husband.

225
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:07,281
Detective Grillo. Poor bastard fell
in love with a uniform junkie.

226
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:11,118
Trixie back there loves
the tough guys.

227
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:15,163
But Grillo? l guess he ain't
tough enough, you know?

228
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:16,882
He's not?

229
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,886
I'll tell you this.

230
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:24,442
Cops sit around here and talk about
how Grillo went soft on the shield.

231
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:29,605
His partner got blasted away
six months ago by some dust freak.

232
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:34,246
Grillo headlight-froze. Panicked.
Couldn't shoot the perp.

233
00:29:34,489 --> 00:29:39,244
Understand? He's in need
of some serious respect.

234
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:42,449
And he just walked through the door.

235
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,284
Uh-oh, Dad's here.

236
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:08,002
-Let's go home.
-Golly, l just got here.

237
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:11,838
Sorry to interrupt
the mourning of your partner.

238
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:20,561
-At least l tried to save my partner.
-Still, he's at the morgue.

239
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:23,363
They take guns from guys
who can't use them.

240
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:24,998
Take them.

241
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:29,489
Pop, where l come from...

242
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:33,648
...if the juice is empty,
you throw away the carton.

243
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:37,406
Yeah, Jack.
What are you gonna do about it?

244
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:44,079
-Let's go.
-Let me go! You are so rude!

245
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:47,247
-You're drunk.
-I am not drunk!

246
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:49,283
Hey, Grillo!

247
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:53,044
You need help catching
the Midtown Murderer, give me a call.

248
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:08,168
Hello.

249
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:13,524
What's your name?

250
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,845
Bitch, turn over!

251
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:48,089
I swear l just ran out of gas
and my car is right over there.

252
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:52,168
Willie, it's me. Don't give me
that line. You don't have a car.

253
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:57,887
Right, l'm sorry. Could you give me
a dollar? l'm saving up for a car.

254
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,238
Here you go.
Don't drink it all in one place.

255
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:12,401
-Did you feel that?
-What?

256
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:17,239
-Movement, like somebody shaking.
-I didn't feel anything.

257
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:41,919
-Who are you?
-How dare you touch her, you insect?

258
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:43,767
She likes it.

259
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:50,405
Take a look at this.

260
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:55,160
Someone threw this guy so hard
his neck snapped like a twig.

261
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:57,724
Someone took care
of the " Midtown" for you.

262
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:09,246
-You'll be okay.
-Will she be all right?

263
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:20,207
-I'm Detective lnspector Grillo.
-Stephanie Lewis.

264
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,047
You've been through a lot.

265
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:25,639
But l'd like a description
of the guy who saved you.

266
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:27,921
Look...

267
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:32,318
...that bastard hit me so hard
l was barely conscious.

268
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:35,646
Hold it. This is a crime scene.

269
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:38,245
But l live here.

270
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:41,839
-I.D.?
-Oh, yeah.

271
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,605
-Here.
-That must have hurt.

272
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:47,037
What?

273
00:35:47,649 --> 00:35:49,924
The tat.

274
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:54,247
Yeah. Yeah, it hurt.

275
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,879
All right, go ahead.

276
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:03,643
I didn't see anything.

277
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:08,923
He must have been pretty big,
to snap your assailant's neck.

278
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:12,642
I.... Quentin.

279
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,040
-You okay?
-Yeah.

280
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:26,682
Detective Grillo, this is Quentin.
He was here, that guy.

281
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:31,957
That creep grabbed me in the hallway.
Somebody saved me.

282
00:36:32,169 --> 00:36:37,038
He was a hero,
and l don't even know who he was.

283
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:40,446
He was gonna kill me.

284
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:44,238
You're safe now, he's gone.

285
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,127
A couple more details.

286
00:36:50,049 --> 00:36:52,643
I'll talk to you later, okay?

287
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:04,168
I had to kill him. You and me,
we do what we have do to save lives.

288
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:09,482
That's me! l'm that guy!
l stopped the killer.

289
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:14,046
I'm a superhero, Thor!
l'm a superhero. Come on.

290
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:19,248
I'm a superhero! l'm a superhero!

291
00:37:26,569 --> 00:37:28,799
Oh, my God.

292
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:36,083
Papa Nick,
l finally got something special.

293
00:37:39,249 --> 00:37:41,444
You're a superhero!

294
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:47,045
Baby, it's me.

295
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:58,602
The Midtown Murderer was killed
tonight. By a civilian.

296
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,845
A civilian hero.

297
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:09,046
It should have been me.

298
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:16,248
I know this case
has been tough on us.

299
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:20,047
The last six months have been tough.

300
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,726
We can try to work it out.

301
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:36,839
You can work out anything
in life, can't you?

302
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:40,364
Trix?

303
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:51,045
It's all right.

304
00:39:31,529 --> 00:39:34,248
Everybody stop moving!

305
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:13,922
Perfect.

306
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:36,798
Hi.

307
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,080
You okay? You look....

308
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:45,407
-I'm okay.
-You look better. Are you packing?

309
00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:50,967
No, l took the day off.
I decided to sort through some stuff.

310
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:54,479
I hear they have some space
in the basement.

311
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:59,638
Listen, l'll come with you.
I got a few things.

312
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:10,685
-That's it?
-I'll get those.

313
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,844
Here, l'll take these.

314
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:26,604
Listen, thank you so much
for letting me cry on your shoulder.

315
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:30,319
I'm glad l was there to help.

316
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:34,078
-You know, after the....
-Hey, check it out.

317
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:37,599
-Back off.
-You guys moving in together now?

318
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:41,165
Hey, nursie, can l get your box?

319
00:42:48,129 --> 00:42:51,326
Leave! Get out of here!

320
00:42:55,649 --> 00:42:58,641
-You all right?
-Yeah.

321
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:12,248
-God, it's grungy down here.
-Nobody ever uses this place.

322
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:14,440
I can see why.

323
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:18,239
-So who are you?
-What?

324
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:20,838
That wasn't you out there.

325
00:43:21,209 --> 00:43:23,848
Maybe it was. Maybe....

326
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:28,844
I guess l'm just mad
about what happened to you.

327
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:32,678
-I didn't mean to upset you.
-Oh, no! No.

328
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:36,848
It was great. It felt great.

329
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:40,280
God, you were amazing. Thank you.

330
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:43,162
You're welcome. Absolutely.

331
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:48,808
I thought l'd be prepared
for what happened to me.

332
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:51,683
I tried to fight back.

333
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:55,245
I guess sometimes
you just aren't strong enough.

334
00:43:55,809 --> 00:43:58,642
We all need someone else sometimes.

335
00:43:59,649 --> 00:44:02,527
-Stephanie?
-Yeah?

336
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:08,682
What if l told you--

337
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:12,287
Oh, God, l'm so embarrassed!

338
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:17,123
I've had these since l was a kid.
I can't believe you saw these.

339
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:21,959
No, it's fine. It's great.

340
00:44:41,089 --> 00:44:46,402
-Dude, what happened to you?
-I've been pretty busy.

341
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:50,045
No. I mean, what the hell
happened to you?

342
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:52,444
You got this whole new vibe.

343
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,765
-Finally get laid?
-Better.

344
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:59,759
-Did you get laid by Lara Croft?
-No.

345
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:05,245
I have superhero powers.

346
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:09,804
No, you don't.
All you got was a new credit card.

347
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:12,807
You always have to pay up later.

348
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:17,207
No, l'm serious. Something
very cool is happening to me.

349
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:22,763
-Why doesn't she play dead?
-Why?

350
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:25,398
Spiders like their prey alive.

351
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:28,248
If you don't move, they don't attack.

352
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:34,045
What superpowers do you have?

353
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:37,645
I don't know. I'm still
trying to figure that out.

354
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:40,642
It must not include
unlimited charge power.

355
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:43,238
You maxed out your credit limit.

356
00:45:46,529 --> 00:45:49,043
That's okay, just bill me.

357
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:52,559
You know l don't bill.

358
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:57,246
I'm good for it. Okay?

359
00:48:33,169 --> 00:48:36,241
Okay, now l need a moving target.

360
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:52,640
Okay, boy, l'm sorry.
I'll get you out.

361
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:01,840
I'm hungrier than l thought.

362
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:05,201
Oh, God!

363
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:19,840
What's the hurry?

364
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:21,888
Watch out!

365
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:52,087
You crazy!

366
00:50:00,729 --> 00:50:02,048
No!

367
00:50:03,129 --> 00:50:04,847
Come here!

368
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,247
I am not crazy!

369
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:17,088
-Get off of me!
-I could rob you.

370
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:19,757
Hey. I could rape you.

371
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:30,044
-Please, stop! No!
-What the fuck?

372
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:44,845
You're safe, go home. Why are
you crying? He was hurting you.

373
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,679
He was not! He was not!

374
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:51,483
He is my boyfriend, you psycho!

375
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:56,797
91 1 ! Please send the police--

376
00:50:57,249 --> 00:50:58,807
You don't need the police.

377
00:50:59,009 --> 00:51:01,204
-What are you?
-I'm your hero.

378
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:04,601
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

379
00:51:05,249 --> 00:51:06,887
Wait! Stop!

380
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:41,118
Shut up!

381
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,886
Jesus Christ.

382
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:53,648
Police!

383
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:09,728
What kind of weird, freaky shit
are you into?

384
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:12,397
What is this shit? Huh?

385
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:38,642
Hey, Thor.

386
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:42,005
What are you doing here?

387
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:45,838
Where's Quentin? What's going on?

388
00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:54,048
" Dear Stephanie,
please take care of Thor.

389
00:52:54,249 --> 00:52:57,719
I can't right now. Quentin."

390
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:41,647
I want to tell you what's happening.
I want you to help me.

391
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:45,444
-But l'm too scared.
-Quentin?

392
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:48,438
I don't want you to be afraid of me.

393
00:53:49,489 --> 00:53:51,844
I don't want to lose you.

394
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:13,847
Looks like a mummy.

395
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:19,280
Well, he looks like he was....
How should l put it technically?

396
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:22,887
-Like something sucked the life out.
-Christ.

397
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:28,279
Yeah. I think blasphemy is
probably appropriate here.

398
00:54:28,529 --> 00:54:30,884
Getting dry-sucked killed him.

399
00:54:31,129 --> 00:54:36,078
But before, he was thrown on
these shelves with incredible force.

400
00:54:36,329 --> 00:54:38,240
Sound familiar?

401
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:44,124
Okay, doc,
let's see what else we can find.

402
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:07,762
It looks like very big cobwebs.

403
00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:31,845
Anybody heard from Williams?

404
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:37,041
There's blood on the step.
Have it typed against Williams.

405
00:55:44,289 --> 00:55:47,884
-How is she?
-Fine, since we cut her free.

406
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:51,240
She's babbling about
some guy with a claw.

407
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:55,478
Get her medical attention,
have her screened for drugs.

408
00:55:55,689 --> 00:56:00,205
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

409
00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:46,047
Quentin, are you okay?
Open the door!

410
00:56:48,649 --> 00:56:53,245
-Goddamn it, open the door!
-Stephanie.

411
00:56:54,409 --> 00:56:58,448
-Not now.
-You sound terrible.

412
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,838
Let me help you.

413
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:07,646
You're scaring me now, okay?

414
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:13,039
I'll get Thor. You want to see Thor?
He really misses you.

415
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,762
Wait!

416
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:19,163
I need to ask you something.

417
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:21,402
Anything.

418
00:57:24,289 --> 00:57:26,484
Would you ever have....

419
00:57:27,609 --> 00:57:31,522
-Would you have gone out with me?
-You?

420
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:38,043
Of course l'd go out with you.
You never asked me.

421
00:57:38,649 --> 00:57:40,844
I wanted you to.

422
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:47,846
-Quentin? Ask me now.
-I can't.

423
00:57:50,529 --> 00:57:52,247
Why?

424
00:57:54,249 --> 00:57:57,844
-It's too late.
-It's not too late.

425
00:57:58,329 --> 00:57:59,887
It is.

426
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:04,242
Go away, please. Please!

427
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:08,846
Go away.

428
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,681
Oh, my God.

429
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:49,039
I can make this work.

430
00:58:50,649 --> 00:58:52,640
I can control this.

431
00:59:18,129 --> 00:59:19,323
Oh, no.

432
00:59:32,729 --> 00:59:35,846
Hungry! Still hungry!

433
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:52,957
Hungry! Still hungry.

434
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:03,604
Still hungry! Shut up!

435
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:05,720
Still hungry! Shut up!

436
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,846
Still hungry!

437
01:00:20,649 --> 01:00:22,446
Hey, bitch!

438
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:27,239
-What did you say?
-I didn't say nothing.

439
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:28,968
I'm here.

440
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:31,846
Hey, Renty.

441
01:00:32,689 --> 01:00:34,247
Where you at?

442
01:00:34,929 --> 01:00:36,647
Down here.

443
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:41,445
Oh, yeah? What are you doing?
Creaming with the cockroaches?

444
01:00:41,689 --> 01:00:44,442
No. Your sister.

445
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:50,719
-Motherfucker! l'm coming down.
-Kick his ass.

446
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:52,123
Where you at?

447
01:00:52,889 --> 01:00:56,040
Lloyd, get down here
and help me find him.

448
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,564
No!

449
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:02,039
Get away from me, man--
No!

450
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:28,845
I saw the news.

451
01:01:30,049 --> 01:01:33,883
-Did they find him yet?
-The killer?

452
01:01:34,089 --> 01:01:36,205
Not the killer.

453
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:39,923
I don't give a damn about the killer.

454
01:01:40,169 --> 01:01:43,684
I don't care if he kills
the whole fucking city.

455
01:01:48,889 --> 01:01:52,040
Nobody's seen Officer Williams.

456
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:56,727
Maybe he got himself lost,
or he got himself dead.

457
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:59,569
Either way, he's out of your life.

458
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:06,808
Oh, Jack.

459
01:02:13,569 --> 01:02:15,639
Oh, Jack.

460
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:21,006
I used to love you so much.

461
01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:27,240
You were so strong.

462
01:02:31,529 --> 01:02:33,360
I need strength, Jack.

463
01:02:36,209 --> 01:02:39,246
I need him. I'm sorry.

464
01:02:45,649 --> 01:02:48,038
-You've done something to him.
-What?

465
01:02:48,249 --> 01:02:50,638
You liar, he's not dead!

466
01:02:50,889 --> 01:02:54,040
You jealous bastard,
you know where he is!

467
01:02:56,369 --> 01:02:58,405
You're one piece of work.

468
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,839
I know you know where he is!

469
01:04:32,609 --> 01:04:37,683
-Can you help me with this?
-This is not a forensics laboratory.

470
01:04:37,889 --> 01:04:40,562
Dr. Callaway, you are the manager.

471
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:44,848
-Why was Kemmer fired?
-It's standard for breached security.

472
01:04:45,769 --> 01:04:47,202
That's fair enough.

473
01:04:47,409 --> 01:04:52,039
-Tell me, what exactly do you do?
-That's classified information.

474
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:55,725
I know, top secret.
The sign says BiochemCo.

475
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:59,842
I assume you do genetics research?

476
01:05:00,049 --> 01:05:01,641
Genetic engineering?

477
01:05:01,889 --> 01:05:04,847
The engineering of genetic material?

478
01:05:05,049 --> 01:05:08,837
If l get a warrant,
all of your work becomes public.

479
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,241
Okay.

480
01:05:12,649 --> 01:05:16,961
You ever see what a spider can do?
What it can survive?

481
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:20,878
Sure, l remember my biology.
They regenerate limbs.

482
01:05:21,129 --> 01:05:25,759
They're strong, fast, and have a
constant hunger that makes them kill.

483
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:27,203
Right.

484
01:05:28,489 --> 01:05:32,846
Any data on introducing spider
material into a human organism?

485
01:05:33,089 --> 01:05:37,446
-We never got that far.
-That you know of.

486
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:49,248
Quentin? Quentin!

487
01:05:51,409 --> 01:05:55,607
You are in there. This is bullshit.
You have to talk to me.

488
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:59,046
Go away. Please.

489
01:06:01,049 --> 01:06:02,641
Quentin?

490
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:04,197
Go away.

491
01:06:04,849 --> 01:06:07,841
Fine! You got it.

492
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:10,959
And l'm keeping your dog.

493
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:17,045
Somebody stop me.

494
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,440
I'll call the police.

495
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:46,041
-Don't move.
-You got it.

496
01:06:46,249 --> 01:06:50,367
I told you l had superhero powers.
What do l do with them?

497
01:06:50,569 --> 01:06:51,638
I don't know.

498
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:54,281
What do you want?

499
01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:58,568
-You need help.
-I'm beyond help, or l'm gonna be.

500
01:06:58,809 --> 01:07:00,367
That's why l'm here.

501
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:02,645
Here's your money.

502
01:07:03,449 --> 01:07:05,838
You've been a good friend to me.

503
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:09,404
What's wrong?

504
01:07:10,409 --> 01:07:11,637
Hungry.

505
01:07:11,889 --> 01:07:13,800
-Dude, l got McNuggets--
-No!

506
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:15,798
Stay still!

507
01:07:16,249 --> 01:07:19,685
Remember what you told me
about spiders and prey?

508
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:24,084
I need to know one thing.
I looked in all my comics.

509
01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:28,038
What would kill
the Arachnid Avenger?

510
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:31,480
-His heart.
-What?

511
01:07:31,729 --> 01:07:32,957
His heart.

512
01:07:33,209 --> 01:07:37,725
What kind of fan are you?
lssue four, an early one, dude.

513
01:07:38,169 --> 01:07:42,242
His heart's human.
It breaks and doesn't grow back.

514
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,839
Don't move...

515
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:52,246
...until l'm gone.

516
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:10,928
Damn.
I always knew this shit was real.

517
01:08:14,969 --> 01:08:20,327
-Ever feel like you just can't move?
-Every day and every night.

518
01:08:21,409 --> 01:08:25,641
Like someone's tied you up,
and you can't find the knot.

519
01:08:26,129 --> 01:08:30,441
After a while it makes sense
to stop struggling.

520
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:35,848
You know what l'm struggling with?
l'm trying to finish up here.

521
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:40,119
Yeah, l got you, Walter.
Me too.

522
01:08:42,529 --> 01:08:45,680
-Thanks, buddy.
-Thank you, Grillo.

523
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:49,281
-See you soon.
-Yeah. Be careful out there.

524
01:10:14,609 --> 01:10:15,883
Mr. Kemmer.

525
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,438
It's Detective lnspector Grillo.

526
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:21,045
I'd like to talk to you.

527
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:27,682
Mr. Kemmer?
Come on, don't make this hard.

528
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:33,127
It's very important
that l speak with you.

529
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:36,480
Save us both a lot of trouble.
Please open up.

530
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:39,082
Wrong place.

531
01:10:40,129 --> 01:10:42,279
Wrong place, wrong time.

532
01:10:57,209 --> 01:11:01,202
-Inspector Grillo.
-The blood outside the liquor store.

533
01:11:01,409 --> 01:11:04,958
-It's Williams' blood.
-Thanks, Doc.

534
01:11:05,169 --> 01:11:09,845
-What about the other specimen?
-What about it? lt's a spider web.

535
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:15,286
I know, but l thought there might be
another component there.

536
01:11:15,529 --> 01:11:19,966
-Like what?
-Deoxyribonucleic Acid.

537
01:11:20,169 --> 01:11:25,197
Human DNA?
Jack, listen to me. Be careful.

538
01:11:25,409 --> 01:11:28,207
They're about to pull you
off the case.

539
01:13:05,489 --> 01:13:07,957
Kemmer?

540
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:12,247
Kemmer, is that you?

541
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:15,441
I can help you.

542
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:19,440
Just come out
where l can see you.

543
01:13:36,049 --> 01:13:37,846
Williams!

544
01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:44,081
Didn't kill me...

545
01:13:45,049 --> 01:13:48,439
-...like the rest.
-The rest?

546
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:06,366
Okay, l'm going to get you down.

547
01:14:06,569 --> 01:14:10,164
-Too late.
-No, it's not too late.

548
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:11,762
Kill me.

549
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:19,797
-Jack?
-Trixie?

550
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,444
Keep me and my baby apart?

551
01:14:23,049 --> 01:14:24,641
You're wrong, Jack.

552
01:14:24,889 --> 01:14:26,720
No, baby! Don't come here!

553
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:29,840
I know you have him in there.

554
01:14:34,409 --> 01:14:35,637
Trixie!

555
01:14:47,009 --> 01:14:49,648
Get away from her now!
Get away!

556
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:57,765
I'm here. It's gonna be okay.

557
01:14:58,249 --> 01:15:00,046
It's gonna be okay, baby.

558
01:15:01,649 --> 01:15:05,437
Trix, l'm so sorry.

559
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:40,322
Hello?

560
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:53,640
It's okay, Thor.

561
01:16:34,649 --> 01:16:38,039
I'm coming. Hold on.

562
01:16:38,489 --> 01:16:40,445
Come on.

563
01:16:41,089 --> 01:16:42,238
Damn it.

564
01:16:49,769 --> 01:16:50,804
Quentin?

565
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:15,048
Oh, my God.

566
01:20:41,449 --> 01:20:45,442
-Oh, my God!
-You'd better go away.

567
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:52,204
-I'll get you down.
-No. You don't understand.

568
01:20:53,969 --> 01:20:56,563
He's here.

569
01:20:59,089 --> 01:21:01,284
He's here.

570
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:28,000
-Save her.
-What?

571
01:21:30,769 --> 01:21:34,842
Save her? Yes.

572
01:21:35,049 --> 01:21:37,119
I very much want to save her.

573
01:21:37,929 --> 01:21:40,443
Stop killer.

574
01:21:42,449 --> 01:21:45,247
-Want me to shoot you?
-Don't shoot him!

575
01:21:51,329 --> 01:21:52,762
I won't do it.

576
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:58,122
No, l won't do that.

577
01:22:03,289 --> 01:22:06,964
-It's not too late!
-I won't.

578
01:22:07,169 --> 01:22:09,364
Stop! Stay away from her!

579
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:11,525
Don't make me do this!

580
01:22:11,729 --> 01:22:13,959
-Stop!
-Don't shoot him!

581
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:32,445
Thank you...

582
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:35,440
...for saving me.

583
01:23:16,769 --> 01:23:21,160
I rarely say this,
but that's not for sale.

584
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:27,522
This is the new, limited edition:
Quentin Arachnid.

585
01:23:27,729 --> 01:23:30,368
He's a friend of mine.
