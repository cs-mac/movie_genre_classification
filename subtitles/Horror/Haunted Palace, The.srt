<i>Episode 30</i>

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,810
Bitch...

4
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,450
Why is it so cold?

5
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,440
You can try all you want but
nothing will change who you are.

6
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,790
Is that so?

7
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,890
You should put down your greed now.

8
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,480
When I become Queen...

9
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,680
You... I will kill you first.

10
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,120
Go ahead...

11
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,260
Lady Gui In.

12
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,680
Your Highness...

13
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,540
I am not questioning the royal traditions.

14
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,330
In a situation where we do not fully
understand how our father passed away

15
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,150
I do not believe it is right to mourn his death so soon.

16
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,100
<i>Are you saying you'll push me out and become King?</i>

17
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,990
Why would Prince So
Hyun possibly lead a revolt?

18
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,790
<i>Father! How could I possibly--</i>

19
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,650
Don't come near me!

20
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,380
I will kill you all!

21
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,720
Don't come near me!
Don't come near me!

22
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,210
Stop right there!
I will kill you all!

23
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,630
Your Highness!

24
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,360
Your Highness, we must bring
the Prince back here.

25
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:47,010
We must bring him back
and reveal exactly how he died!

26
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,750
They moved Prince because
they have something to hide!

27
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,050
Where did they move Prince So Hyun to?

28
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,070
I was told Jang Kyung Palace.

29
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,810
All the roads to Jang Kyung Palace
have been blocked off.

30
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,750
If they decide to proceed
with funeral ceremonies tonight--

31
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,790
We will never be able to find
out how the Crown Prince died!

32
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,730
Your Highness, I will take the lead.

33
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,820
Us five will do whatever
it takes to open up the roads so you--

34
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,640
You must refrain Your Highness.

35
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,580
You should not get involved uncle!

36
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,150
You have to think of Prince Suk Chul!

37
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,500
There is nothing we can do
about a man that's already left us.

38
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:04,180
We can wait until Suk Chul has been crowned
to closely inspect Prince So Hyun's body.

39
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,320
He is right.

40
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,530
Everyone please leave now.

41
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,300
Your Highness!

42
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,250
Let's do that.

43
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,300
The Chinese envoy has arrived anyways

44
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,680
so the King will have to be
clear as to how the Prince died.

45
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,240
Anyone can tell you that his
sudden death was caused by poison.

46
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,100
What do you mean poisoned to
death? Be careful what you say!

47
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,020
Your Highness!

48
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,770
I also suspected such a thing and
closely inspected the Prince's body.

49
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,850
The Prince died in peace.

50
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,820
How can you say poison?

51
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,540
Welcome Lord Kim.

52
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,220
Did you get the Prince here safely?

53
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,590
Yes, Lord Kim.

54
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,010
Would you like to take a look?

55
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,860
He was bleeding from
every open pore on his body

56
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,990
so I cleaned it all up

57
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,330
and closed off the holes with cotton.

58
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,130
You must not let anyone in
here without my permission.

59
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,510
Yes, Lord Kim.

60
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,570
Uncle, please take the lead
and rush the crowning of the prince.

61
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,440
Do not worry about that.

62
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,140
It is only right that Suk Chul is crowned

63
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,360
so His Highness will not
be able to say otherwise.

64
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,130
His Highness couldn't have done it.

65
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,950
There's no way...
He wouldn't...

66
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:09,190
His Highness wouldn't
have possibly cut ties with his son.

67
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,450
He didn't.

68
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,320
Right?

69
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,580
That's the most painful.

70
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:41,500
The fact I keep suspecting His Highness...

71
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,080
The Princess said that there's
no way His Highness was behind it?

72
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,540
Yes, Lady Gui In.

73
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,320
Okay. You can leave now.

74
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,770
You see!

75
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,750
I told you the Princess
wouldn't believe His Highness did it.

76
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,480
And if that happens--

77
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,450
Prince Suk Chul will be crowned.

78
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,230
If that happens a storm will
one day blow through the palace.

79
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,350
Indeed.

80
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,960
If His Highness is killed

81
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,980
and Prince Suk Chul becomes King

82
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,300
then he will try to unveil
exactly how his father died.

83
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,130
Then everyone will die.

84
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,740
Father

85
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,980
Yes?

86
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,550
Hurry.

87
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,610
Before Prince Suk Chul is crowned

88
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,020
I must become Queen.

89
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,330
That way if the King dies I
can at least be the Queen Mother

90
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:03,190
and once that happens the
Princess will not be able to kill me.

91
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,240
You must make my mother your
wife in order for me to become Queen.

92
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,290
That way I can live and so can you.

93
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,660
Why won't you say anything?

94
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,220
Yes Lady Gui In.

95
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,130
- The Princess?
- Yes Your Highness.

96
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,180
She closely inspected the Prince's body?

97
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,490
Yes Your Highness.

98
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,860
She was unable to find
any traces of poisoning

99
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,890
and said the Prince died in peace.

100
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,290
Really?

101
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,050
Yes Your Highness.

102
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,250
That means that the
Princess was suspicious of me!

103
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,860
Your Highness

104
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,290
Even if I did hate my child!

105
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,080
If you hurry and crown Prince Suk Chul

106
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,870
everything will quiet down.

107
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,070
Please accept the Princess's wish
Your Highness.

108
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,030
Right now is not the time
for such a thing.

109
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,490
You must make the
Princess promise you Your Highness.

110
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,030
I am telling you to make her
promise that she will not question you

111
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,390
later on surrounding Prince So Hyun's death.

112
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,960
Why make her promise?

113
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,780
What connection are you saying
that I have to the Prince's death?

114
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,680
Your Highness

115
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,420
You must live the rest of your life
with a large weight on your shoulders.

116
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,520
Even if you say that you are
not related to the Prince's death

117
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,840
The way people will look at you--

118
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,670
Please watch what you say.

119
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,190
Who are you saying would
dare suspect His Highness?

120
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,840
Well for starters, you are
suspicious of His Highness!

121
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,630
The reason you are urging him
to rush to crown Prince Suk Chul

122
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,640
is your way of telling him not to
do anything else to make people suspicious.

123
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,220
Am I wrong?

124
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,320
Your Highness, it is only right
that you crown Prince Suk Chul.

125
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,620
However you must buy yourself some time.

126
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,450
That way the Princess will become desperate

127
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,720
and will come begging to you first.

128
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,800
You can grant her what she wishes then.

129
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,800
You can also make her
promise that she will not

130
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,620
stir trouble surrounding
the Prince's death.

131
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,820
I told you I had nothing to do with it!

132
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,790
Who cares about the truth?

133
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,980
People only believe
what they want to believe.

134
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,340
Those who support the Princess
will believe what she says

135
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,760
and your supporters will
believe whatever you say.

136
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,790
However, once Prince Suk Chul is crowned

137
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,030
who will believe you?

138
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,030
Your will become a man
who killed his son--

139
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,400
Enough!

140
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,170
My silence is not permission
for you to continue to blab!

141
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,740
Why are you hesitating?

142
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,080
Kill me with that sword now!

143
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:59,820
I came to you prepared to die tonight.

144
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,650
If I'm going to die in the hands of the Princess

145
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,400
I'd be happier if you killed me instead.

146
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,030
Fine...

147
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,450
That is exactly what I'm saying.

148
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,590
Who will believe me?

149
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,480
I was so hard on So Hyun

150
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,360
so everyone will say I killed him!

151
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:51,710
Did you know?

152
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:02,360
There is no way for you
to escape the accusations.

153
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,690
Lord Kim is trying to have
Prince Bong Rim crowned.

154
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,420
We must put the Princess
at ease right now.

155
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,850
China stands behind the Princess

156
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,550
and more than anything
we cannot beat her upbringing.

157
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,530
Everyone is devastated that
the Prince was wrongfully killed

158
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,780
so if we ignore Prince Suk Chul
and crown prince Bong Rim instead

159
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,610
who will win?

160
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,610
Then you should have told His Highness that--

161
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,090
While His Highness may have
Prince Bong Rim in mind right now

162
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,390
and if misfortunes arise and he is
presented with a difficult situation

163
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:05,690
he will change his mind overnight
and blame everything on Lord Kim.

164
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,930
So--

165
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:15,730
So we must make thorough preparations
so His Highness does not change his mind.

166
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,120
For as long as Princess Min Hwe
and Prince Suk Chul are alive

167
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,800
we must make it clear to His Highness
that there is absolutely nothing he can do.

168
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,640
Then are you saying we must
also kill the Princess and Prince Suk Chul?

169
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,450
Exactly.

170
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,830
As long as the Princess and
Suk Chul are alive

171
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,080
this war will not end.

172
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,840
What use will it be if
Prince Bong Rim is crowned?

173
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,120
Do not let history slip by you.

174
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,050
After Crown Prince Uigyeong died
his son Yejong took the throne.

175
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,070
But in the end In Soo's son
rose to the throne.

176
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,370
In the end, the nation will belong
to the Princess.

177
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,550
I think I understand what you are saying now.

178
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,160
Remember.

179
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,380
Reconcile with the Princess?

180
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,700
Yes Your Highness.

181
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,050
Prince Suk Chul is your blood.

182
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,170
And what about Bong Rim?

183
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,080
Are you saying he is not?

184
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,090
<i>I thought maybe because of
his three sons he's leaving behind</i>

185
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:12,350
<i>May not be able to leave
completely and his spirit is wandering...</i>

186
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,730
Impossible.

187
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,600
Your Highness

188
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,260
Absolutely not.

189
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,480
Until the Princess kneels in front of me

190
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,950
and begs me for forgiveness.

191
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,360
Brother! Chung Myung Soo
has entered the palace!

192
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,310
The Chinese envoy has arrived

193
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,360
so His Highness will no longer be able to deny anything.

194
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,450
Go and tell the Princess!

195
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,000
Yes brother!

196
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,240
What do you think uncle?

197
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,120
The Princess just barely calmed down.

198
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,150
It is easier said than done.

199
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,510
To take His Highness to China
when Prince So Hyun has passed away.

200
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,020
It will be difficult for His Highness to ignore

201
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,980
the Emperor's orders for him to come to China.

202
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,590
Which means that aside from
the possibility of being crowned

203
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,420
Prince Suk Chul has a chance of actually becoming King.

204
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,810
Congratulations Your Highness!

205
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,380
Prince Suk Chul is still young

206
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,770
so you will have to act on his behalf.

207
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,270
Where are you going?

208
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,430
We must guard the Prince's corpse.

209
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,230
Do not go around causing trouble.

210
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,490
Trouble?

211
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,740
There are rumors that Kim Ja Jeom will
proceed with funeral preparations tonight!

212
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,700
That means that unless we open up the coffin

213
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,280
we will not be able to find out
the truth behind the Prince's death!

214
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,940
- Let's go!
- Okay!

215
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,600
Your Highness

216
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,820
This is no different than declaring war.

217
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,670
Once you start, you cannot turn back.

218
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,750
Will you still continue?

219
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:42,180
I... cannot trust His Highness.

220
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,350
Your Highness!

221
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,980
Until His Highness
begs for forgiveness

222
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,040
I will not back down.

223
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,950
Your Highness!

224
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,640
So...did you bring
Emperor Shunzhi's letter?

225
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,940
And just what does it say?

226
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,580
Does it say for me to go to
China and pay respects to him?

227
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,580
Yes it does Your Highness.

228
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,520
So he's saying he wants to
take me prisoner this time?

229
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,560
Yes, Your Highness.

230
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,500
Okay. Let's hear exactly
what the letter says.

231
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,800
Please do not be too upset by it
Your Highness.

232
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,460
After hearing Prince So Hyun died

233
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,280
the Chinese envoy has already
returned to Beijing.

234
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,470
What?

235
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,020
They went back?

236
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,070
Yes Your Highness.

237
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,180
Are you serious?

238
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,760
Yes Lord Kim.

239
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,860
Tell us exactly what happened.

240
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,440
I advised that with the Crown Prince gone,
if we take the Joseon King to Beijing

241
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,950
there will be great unrest in Joseon.

242
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,930
So recommend leaving you here.

243
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,570
The men nodded and went back
the way they came.

244
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,290
Is that so?

245
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:22,020
It's all because of you. Thanks to you
His Highness was able to avoid an obstacle.

246
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,650
However Your Highness

247
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,650
You'll have to be more careful from now on.

248
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,060
The Emperor and Prince So Hyun
were very close friends

249
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,400
so he will not back down without a fight.

250
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,050
Of course not.

251
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,350
What do you think?

252
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:47,130
I'm thinking about crowning
Prince Bong Rim instead of Suk Chul.

253
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,220
Would the Emperor be okay with that?

254
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,210
It won't be easy.

255
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,790
If you crown Prince Bong Rim

256
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,550
there is no way the Emperor will allow it.

257
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:06,570
Then am I supposed to crown
Suk Chul who is not even 10 years old yet?

258
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,860
And what if something happens to me?

259
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,010
What will happen to our nation?

260
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,450
Your Highness

261
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,150
This concludes my duties.

262
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,700
From here on out, you must think wisely

263
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,230
and make the right decisions.

264
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,200
Hold on.

265
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,080
A word.

266
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,250
Is he saying that Joseon belongs to China?

267
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,580
Who do they think they are?

268
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,670
Why should we get permission from
them who we decide will be crowned?

269
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,180
How can you say all that to His Highness?

270
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,850
If he does not crown Prince Suk Chul

271
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,780
Emperor Shunzhi will never forgive him.

272
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,220
Even if that was the case.

273
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,270
If it wasn't for me the Chinese
envoy would not have turned around.

274
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,230
You should be grateful.

275
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,140
That fool...

276
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,730
Who did you say is here?

277
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,250
Allow him inside.

278
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,060
What brings you here?

279
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,000
Are you here to relay
a message from His Highness?

280
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,320
If so please go back
the way you came.

281
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,600
- Your Highness--
- I said I do not want to hear it!

282
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,850
Please back down now.

283
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,110
After Prince So Hyun was
dragged away to China

284
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,390
there was not a single night
His Highness slept peacefully.

285
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,410
When you left for China

286
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,120
Prince Suk Chul was still a newborn.

287
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,130
You breastfed that child

288
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,420
and then watching you take off
to a faraway land

289
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,040
His Highness wept tears of blood
over and over again.

290
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:41,050
How could His Highness possibly have
forgotten about that heartbreaking farewell?

291
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,110
Your Highness

292
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,820
Love and hatred are as thin as paper.

293
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,750
If you just give in

294
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,660
and ask His Highness for his understanding

295
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,140
how can he possibly deny Prince Suk Chul?

296
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,250
My brothers went to Jang Kyung palace.

297
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,090
Even before all the heat left
the Prince's body...

298
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,650
How can they call it all useless?

299
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,080
What is he trying to
hide to rush things so much?

300
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,250
Must you get to the bottom of that
Your Highness?

301
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,860
Please preserve the body Your Highness!

302
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,850
You fools... I remember each
and every one of your faces.

303
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,190
Go on inside.

304
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,850
Her Highness has something to say.

305
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,840
We must protect the Prince!

306
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,620
You must consider Prince Suk Chul!

307
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,800
If you so much as lay a finger
on His Highness without our permission

308
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,630
I will not just stand by and watch.

309
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,200
Lets go!

310
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,680
If you want to talk about unfair

311
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:03,630
we should go against the King and
get to the truth behind the Prince's death.

312
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,040
That way he may rest in peace.

313
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:19,360
However I cannot help but
to look out for Suk Chul's future.

314
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,670
He must inherit the throne

315
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:28,590
in order for us to build the
new nation the Prince dreamed of.

316
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,990
Your Highness...

317
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,570
We must make sure the
Prince's dream comes true.

318
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,130
We must create a new nation.

319
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,840
A strong and prosperous nation
that will not crumble to others.

320
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:56,230
That way... the Prince will rest in peace.

321
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,980
Your Highness!

322
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:06,270
I will never cry ever again.

323
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,940
Until the day Suk Chul rises to the throne

324
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,580
I will endure whatever hardships
and pain that may come.

325
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,690
So please don't cry.

326
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,820
Keep your eyes wide open
and watch out for Prince Suk Chul.

327
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:33,530
That way we may build the
nation that Prince So Hyun dreamed of.

328
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,820
Your Highness!

329
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,730
What brings you here?

330
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,860
Have a seat.

331
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,060
Prime Minister

332
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:00,090
Tonight I looked over Prince So Hyun's body
that is at Jang Kyung Palace

333
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:07,180
It was so horrendous I could not
bear to look at it.

334
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,110
What are you trying to say?

335
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,330
It has only been a day since
Prince So Hyun passed away

336
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,810
but his body has turned black

337
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:20,520
and there was dry pus built
up on his eyes, nose and mouth.

338
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:26,500
Are you implying the Prince was
poisoned to death?

339
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,130
His Highness is considering
Prince Bong Rim to become the crown prince.

340
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,950
And if he does become the Crown Prince

341
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,520
everyone will think His Highness
is responsible for Prince So Hyun's death.

342
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,470
So you must somehow prevent
this from becoming a larger ordeal.

343
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,270
For who?

344
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,230
Is it for Prince Suk Chul and
Princess Min Hwe?

345
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,310
Or are you telling me to do this
for His Highness?

346
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:14,260
I am asking you to do it for our nation.

347
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,540
Why don't you do this Your Highness.

348
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:56,960
Looking back on history,
a parent is supposed to

349
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,020
wear cham chae attire at
their child's funeral.

350
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,840
But this time instead of wearing
cham chae attire

351
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,880
wear gi nyun attire.

352
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,430
I'm telling you to wear the outfit for just a year.

353
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,690
When I compare the time to my sadness

354
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,420
wearing it to the day I die is not enough!

355
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,080
But you must hurry and set a burial site

356
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,010
and crown Prince Suk Chul.

357
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,240
You must do that

358
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,750
so China does not give you a hard time.

359
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,210
Are you here as a favor to the Princess?

360
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,790
Your Highness

361
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,380
It's the only way to stop the Princess.

362
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,290
What do you mean stop her?

363
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,300
If not... Then are you going to kill her?

364
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,980
If you are thinking of passing
on the throne to Prince Bong Rim

365
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,440
then you are bringing  trouble and
misfortunes upon yourself.

366
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,600
Am I wrong?

367
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,910
You are mistaken Prime Minister.

368
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,700
How can I possible want
what belongs to my nephew?

369
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:33,020
Then you should have been
a step ahead of me

370
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,420
and taken care of this already!

371
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,180
Your Highness

372
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,860
while you may be able to
divert a river stream

373
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:50,390
as it gets lower, the stream will
move much quicker.

374
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,680
You must go with the flow!

375
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,650
I'll take that you understand
me and I will leave now.

376
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,030
Tell the Princess

377
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,240
to not stand up to the King anymore.

378
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,450
<i>A grave was set for Prince So Hyun
so so ryun and dae ryun proceeded.</i>

379
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:56,060
<i>However, the writing on the
Prince's coffin became a problem.</i>

380
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:03,230
<i>While it was supposed to say
Jae Gohng which stands for king</i>

381
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:08,530
<i>It said Nuhl Goo which is the word
typically used by commoners and foreigners.</i>

382
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,790
How can they write Nuhl Goo
on his coffin!

383
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:22,060
Your Highness, you must correct
the writing on there!

384
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,820
We have been fooled!

385
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,020
If we attended the soh ryum
and dae ryum

386
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,550
then we'd find out the Prince was
poisoned to death

387
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,730
so they pretended to be
making amends with you!

388
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:40,280
His Highness has no intention of
crowning Prince Suk Chul!

389
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,170
You must not Your Highness!

390
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:49,530
Why do you always hold her back?

391
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:58,450
To write that on his coffin means the King
doesn't acknowledge him as the Crown Prince!

392
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,410
Even still! You must stand back Your Highness!

393
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,930
Why do you not have your funeral outfit on?

394
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,630
It was too much work so I
decided to not wear it anymore.

395
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:36,920
Should His Highness not be
wearing the outfit for a full year?

396
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,390
If you count each day as a month

397
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,620
then 12 days is equivalent to a year.

398
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,960
Does such a rule exist?

399
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,310
Doing so is referred to as the
Yuh Gohl Law.

400
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:56,600
Has it not only been a week
since the Prince died?

401
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,800
I added another level.

402
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:09,420
I didn't want it to seem as though
I'm taking advantage of my son's death.

403
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,690
What were you doing Court Lady Park?

404
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,320
If you let me know sooner

405
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,550
I would have changed into
proper attire before coming here.

406
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,870
You are right.

407
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:31,300
Being too sad over a child's death
is also not the duty of a parent.

408
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:37,430
For a child to go before their
parents is the worst thing.

409
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,560
Since you are willing to hide
your sadness

410
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,790
and let go of it all

411
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,860
I feel much better.

412
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,350
Good job Your Highness.

413
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,560
I'm sure it's a sight to see.

414
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:23,190
That was the Queen mocking me.

415
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,890
Are you saying His Highness has
already taken off his mourning attire?

416
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:35,760
That means he has no
intention of crowning Prince Suk Chul.

417
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,530
As far as I know, the Prime Minister stepped in

418
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,160
so the King and Princess made amends...

419
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,910
It was probably the King's efforts to
avoiding suspicion in the Prince's death.

420
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,490
I saw the King's true colors today.

421
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,100
So I will need you to act on my behalf.

422
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,130
What do you have in mind?

423
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,010
We must make Prince Bong Rim
the Crown Prince.

424
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:10,330
The council has already swayed to
Prince Suk Chul's side.

425
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,240
I told you His Highness has
Prince Bong Rim in mind!

426
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,440
Your Highness

427
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:20,240
If you go against the favored
decision you will be very lonely in the future.

428
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,240
How many times must I tell you
for you to understand me?

429
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,700
Prince Bong Rim is the only one
who will protect me.

430
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,490
It's not like the Princess will
treat me as her mother-in-law.

431
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,000
I will never forget the look
in her eyes during the chin jam rye.

432
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:45,700
Her boasting to me after putting
the councilmen wives in place...

433
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:58,150
The Queen said Prince Bong Rim
is the only who can protect her?

434
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,490
Yes Lady Gui In.

435
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,570
You see!

436
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:05,840
I told you the Queen was holding
the Princess at a arm's distance.

437
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:12,470
She must not have liked the Princess
during the chin jam rye ceremony.

438
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,050
Everything is going as planned.
Why are you sighing?

439
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,910
I should have kicked the Queen out of
the palace sooner.

440
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,220
It looks as though I have
my work cut out for me.

441
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:40,270
This is why I said Prince Suk Chul
must be crowned.

442
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,640
The Queen said that?

443
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,040
Yes Your Highness.

444
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,650
Prince Bong Rim is the only person
she can rely on?

445
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,190
That's not all.

446
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,080
After seeing that His Highness
had taken off his mourning attire

447
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,230
she told him he did a good job.

448
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,770
There is no way...

449
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,910
There is no way the Princess would...

450
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,820
Just be relieved that was
all that happened to us!

451
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,450
All of us could have died!

452
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,040
You cursed man!

453
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,430
Do you think I do not know what you did?

454
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:40,730
What are you talking about?

455
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,800
You poisoned your needle to--

456
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,140
Don't go around talking gibberish!

457
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:48,930
The Prince suddenly dying

458
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,800
was because of his tonic!
The whole world knows about it!

459
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,040
Who are you trying to blame now?

460
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,950
You fool! We never prescribed medicine
for the Prince!

461
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,460
You wretched man!

462
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,290
If we were released alive
thanks to Lord Kim

463
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,260
we should be grateful!

464
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,720
That man ought to die!

465
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:20,760
You fool!

466
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,090
You were working with him!

467
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,300
You've lost your mind!

468
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,580
You fool!

469
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,380
Do you think I will back down without a fight?

470
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:39,030
I will go to the Princess and
tell her what you have done!

471
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,070
Do you intend on being killed
while you're at it?

472
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,420
What the--

473
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,930
Wait for me!

474
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,070
You fools! Such selfish men!

475
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,070
Fools!

476
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,750
Why are you still standing here?

477
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,570
Have you not had enough?

478
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,540
No no! No no...

479
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,110
My goodness...my goodness...

480
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,030
Please do not worry too much.

481
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:19,450
He was so severely beaten he will
not be able to speak if he wishes to do so.

482
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:25,000
I told you to take care of him
so he'd die of internal bleeding...

483
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,810
That will only draw more attention to you.

484
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,160
I will stop by the medical department
from time to time.

485
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,260
You're perfectly fine!

486
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,020
I don't even want to talk about it!

487
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,530
Who said I'm perfectly fine?

488
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:55,960
They beat the men around me like dogs

489
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,030
I was so nervous I almost peed my pants.

490
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,240
My goodness...

491
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:11,400
Did everything go smoothly?

492
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,540
What are you talking about?

493
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,620
By the time you moved the body,
the poison would have spread everywhere--

494
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,180
You're wasting your time!

495
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,410
You think His Highness
did not know any better?

496
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:26,280
So you are saying His Highness
knows about everything?

497
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,680
Of course he does!

498
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:34,040
I wasn't sure so I was so nervous!

499
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:37,870
Think about it!

500
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,220
If that was completely unrelated
to His Highness

501
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,360
then I never know when
I would take the fall for it.

502
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,510
So I'd be so nervous and then not

503
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,610
and went back and forth
between life and death.

504
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,370
What is the highest position
on the medical staff?

505
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,840
It is Chum Jung.

506
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,050
And below that there are
Pan Jun and Joo Bo

507
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,300
then Jik Ja, Bong Sa, Bo Bong Sa...

508
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,890
and Cham Bohk is the lowest.

509
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,560
I am Cham Bohk.

510
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,180
Lady Gui In.

511
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:22,270
I just want to become a Bong Sa...

512
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,490
What?

513
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:27,370
At the very least you should be
Chum Jung!

514
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,060
That would be too much for me.

515
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,160
What do you mean?

516
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:39,530
Thanks to you my son could become King.

517
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,130
You just have to lend your skills
one more time.

518
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,780
What do you mean...

519
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,010
Why are you so surprised?

520
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,390
I'm asking an acupuncturist for acupuncture.

521
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,290
What is it? Did you pee your pants?

522
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:23,380
How dare you!

523
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,560
Come to me.

524
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,870
Come to me.

525
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,990
Wait.

526
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,510
Your mother is going to make you a king.

527
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,900
It won't take too long.

528
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,930
Trust me.

529
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,590
<i>Did you stay up all night writing this?</i>

530
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,990
<i>It was like a river flowing out of me.
I wrote it all in one sitting.</i>

531
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,460
What do you think?

532
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,070
<i>We will be able to catch
up to China in less than 10 years.</i>

533
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:40,250
I must show this to father today.

534
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:50,070
<i>But what exactly does all that mean?</i>

535
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:55,740
<i>It is creating a nation
where the people are happy.</i>

536
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,840
<i>And if we build a nation
where people are happy</i>

537
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,090
<i>will what I endured be
washed away naturally?</i>

538
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:08,910
<i>The humiliation you endured
is an unfortunate part of our history.</i>

539
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:11,170
What?

540
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,400
<i>- Please... if you just listen more--
- I've heard enough!</i>

541
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,430
<i>You are no longer my child!</i>

542
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:28,460
<i>What child tells their parent
that their pain is just a part of history</i>

543
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:34,850
<i>rather than trying to help them
recover from it?</i>

544
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:40,400
<i>I don't want to ever see you again!</i>

545
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:45,980
My Prince...

546
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:21,320
Do you know what kind of nation
your father dreamed of building?

547
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,360
Yes mother.

548
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,350
I read the proposals father wrote.

549
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,480
I do not yet know enough to
fully understand everything

550
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,030
but what I did understand I
will carry with me deep in my heart.

551
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:51,570
Come here.

552
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:16,270
You are the only one who will
be able to fulfill your father's dreams.

553
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:22,940
That way, even if he is no longer
with us physically

554
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,240
he can live forever.

555
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:33,260
Do not let your father's death be in vain.

556
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,440
Do you understand?

557
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,700
Yes mother.

558
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,440
Do not cry.

559
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:56,670
Until the day you step up to the throne
and become King

560
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,870
you must not cry.

561
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:09,330
I too will not cry until then.

562
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:13,720
Do you understand?

563
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,950
Yes mother...

564
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,830
<i>Suk Chul is probably
waddling around by now.</i>

565
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,450
<i>Were you thinking about our child?</i>

566
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,380
<i>Do you know why I'm so happy?</i>

567
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:54,460
<i>Because here I am able to
fall asleep next to you every night</i>

568
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,770
<i>and wake up to you.</i>

569
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:00,500
<i>I feel the same way my love.</i>

570
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:17,310
Oh my! Oh my!
Oh my! Oh my!

571
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,010
Father...

572
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:32,450
<i>I'm sorry. I overslept.</i>

573
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:35,800
Wife!

574
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:41,380
Your father has already lost his power
as a leader.

575
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:43,010
Wife!

576
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,220
I am not telling you to accept the offer.

577
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:50,360
I am asking you to find a way
for you to survive.

578
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,120
Build a new nation.

579
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,760
That is the only way for you to live.

580
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,700
Father!

581
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:39,160
Father!

582
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,620
Father!

583
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,510
Father...

584
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:34,700
I...

585
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:43,670
intend to pass on the throne
to Prince Bong Rim!

586
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:09,860
