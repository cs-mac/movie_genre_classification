1
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,390
Sarah.

2
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,230
Sarah.

3
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,360
Sarah.

4
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,240
Sarah.

5
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,800
Sarah.

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,260
Same dream.

7
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,560
There's smoke.

8
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,310
Someone takes her hand.
She's running.

9
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,520
The same man
comes towards her.

10
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,570
Jay Prescott with some
cool morning sounds,

11
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,280
and enjoy it while you can...

12
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,030
...because it's gonna be
an unreasonably hot one

13
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,660
later in the day in LA,
going up to 95 in the Valley,

14
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,320
92 in the Basin and upper to 70s

15
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,910
- in Santa Monica and the beaches.
- Hello?

16
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,910
- And now, appropriately enough...
- Hello?

17
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,620
...here's Yvonne Murray
with "Burning Up."

18
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,750
Hello?

19
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,590
Ms. Julius?

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,750
Sorry, wrong number.

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,010
Remember who the ninth circle of Hell
is reserved for.

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,220
Hmm.

23
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,690
- Morning!
- Morning.

24
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,350
- So, what do you want for breakfast?
- I don't have time.

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,320
I got an early class.

26
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,690
Close-up--

27
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,070
his eye gleams
like volcanic lava.

28
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,200
Sarah stands transfixed

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,620
like a deer
in a car's headlights.

30
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,160
Sarah? Why did you
name your character Sarah?

31
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,250
I don't know.

32
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,330
- More dreams, huh?
- Yep.

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,340
I'm not getting any sleep,
but it's gonna make a great film.

34
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,510
I wonder if Orson Welles
dreamt "Citizen Kane" first.

35
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,990
We're in a huge cathedral with gargoyles
all over, mixed with religious icons.

36
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,620
Mm!

37
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,330
- Mark!
- Mm.

38
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,750
- I want you, Maggie, right now.
- Mark, I can't.

39
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,040
Come on,
let's go back to my place.

40
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,670
- I'm-- I'm dying without you.
- Mark, this is the age of safe sex

41
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,250
and sex with you on any level
is not safe.

42
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,090
Come on, Maggie.
Why won't you give us a chance, huh?

43
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,920
I'm crazy about you, but I'm not
gonna let you shine me on forever.

44
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,760
I'm not, I'm just concentrating
on my script right now.

45
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,010
Yeah, right, the script.

46
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,430
Come on,
this is really important to me.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,390
I just can't let anything distract me.

48
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,690
Okay.

49
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,190
Okay, I see.

50
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,060
I just hope I'm still around
when you decide to get distracted.

51
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,610
Give me a break.

52
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,940
Ugh.

53
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,160
It's cloudy and misty...

54
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,410
- Joannie, ah!
- Bud!

55
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,910
Hey, Bud, it's not a speedway,
you know?

56
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,330
- Sorry.
- Come on, people.

57
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,080
We got good news, we got bad news,
we got all kinds of news.

58
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,830
- Go ahead, Tina.
- Okay, first,

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,550
- we lost our editing space again.
- Oh, no!

60
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,170
You know,
they stick us in the library,

61
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,970
then the biology lab,
and now the music room.

62
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,800
Yeah, how come it's always
the film department that gets shafted?

63
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,970
What do you have to do
to be taken seriously around here?

64
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,140
You gotta learn
how to kick ass, man.

65
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,850
Yeah!

66
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,860
Well, we are a novelty item.

67
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,270
Every new department

68
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,650
has to make a splash
to get on the map.

69
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,030
And that's the good news because
Toby's come up with a great idea.

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,320
- Go ahead, Tobe.
- Yeah, Toby!

71
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,700
Here's our new idea.

72
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,780
We do an all-night horrorthon.

73
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,910
- Ugh.
- No, this is a terrific idea.

74
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,580
An all-night horror show.
They're big grossers.

75
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,250
Hey, gang,
I got a better idea.

76
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,540
Why don't we put on a play?

77
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,880
We'll convert the old barn
into a theater, huh?

78
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,670
- Please.
- Is there an inherited gene

79
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,260
for obnoxiousness?

80
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,850
- Yeah.
- These are the future writers

81
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,810
and directors
of the American cinema.

82
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,640
It's the "Police Academy" syndrome.

83
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,810
Hey, hey!

84
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,140
There's more social relevance

85
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,600
and character development
in "Police Academy 5"

86
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,860
than in all of Ingmar Bergman's
cinematic smorgasbord.

87
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,940
Bergman's fleshy ambiguities,
as one critic said...

88
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,030
- I believe he did say that.
- No, no, no.

89
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,450
Joannie, how would you know?

90
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,450
Your favorite film
is "Escape from Witch Mountain."

91
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,160
- Shh!
- Hey, hey, hey, fellas!

92
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,330
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

93
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,410
What makes you think
people are gonna pay six bucks

94
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,540
to see some crappy old movie
they wouldn't even rent for 99 cents?

95
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,880
Because you can't see "Mosquito"
at home

96
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,840
in 3-D what's it--
what's it called?

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,340
- Project-o-Vision.
- Right.

98
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,130
Nor can you watch "The Stench"
in authentic Odor-o-Scope.

99
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,510
- Aroma-Rama.
- Oh.

100
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,970
Noseguards given at the theatre.

101
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,550
You could use those in lots of movies.

102
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,970
Right.
Or "The Amazing Electrified Man"

103
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,350
- in...
- Shock-o-Scope.

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
And that's why

105
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,850
they're gonna pay 10 bucks.

106
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,560
See, every one of these pictures

107
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,190
was originally released
with some kind of a promotional gimmick.

108
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,150
Yeah, which
we're gonna recreate for our audience

109
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,280
- only with improvements.
- So, on the one hand,

110
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,200
- it'll be a total goof.
- And on the other hand,

111
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,990
we're gonna scare
the living shit out of them.

112
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,990
So, how do you vote?

113
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,670
Oh, there might be
enough money left over

114
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,920
for some of you to do your own
little experimental film.

115
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,420
- Bingo!
- I'm in.

116
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,170
Hmm.

117
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,170
Maggie?

118
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,390
We're voting.

119
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,930
Yep.

120
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,070
Welcome to the house of ushers.

121
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,450
Wow.

122
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,490
The old Dreamland theater.

123
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,320
It was a live theater
for a long time

124
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,160
before they converted it
to a cinema.

125
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,460
- Toby, it's great.
- Yeah, isn't it?

126
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,370
Kind of sad we're gonna be
its swan song.

127
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,170
They're tearing this place down
in three weeks.

128
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,460
Three weeks?
Are you crazy?

129
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,880
We can't get this festival ready
in three weeks.

130
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,260
Yes, you can
because I am here to help you.

131
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,600
Malcolm Mnesyne
at your disposal

132
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,230
- so to speak.
- Hi, Dr. M.

133
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,560
Hello, Tony.

134
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,270
I'm Toby.

135
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,860
Yes, yes, of course you are,
dear boy.

136
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,230
My cargo is outside

137
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,450
and it will require all of you
to bring it in.

138
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,370
I'll be waiting center stage
where I belong.

139
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,740
Thanks a lot for coming, Dr. M.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,920
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Dr. M's Movie Memorabilia shop.

141
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,960
He's got everything we need
for the festival.

142
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,010
Now, what you see here

143
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,970
are the priceless relics
of a bygone era of showmanship.

144
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,680
I refer not to myself,

145
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,850
but to the contents
of these crates,

146
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,980
which I have stored
and lovingly tended

147
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,020
since my own youthful days
as manager of a movie palace

148
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,240
very much like the Dreamland.

149
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,780
We had theaters in those days,

150
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,240
not like these cine-, omni-, multi-,
whatchama-plex things today

151
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,990
with 29 screens

152
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,080
the size of postage stamps.

153
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,750
And we had fun.

154
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,420
The ballyhoo,

155
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,040
the giveaways,

156
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,090
the bullshit.

157
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,050
I could tell you stories.

158
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,130
The point is we put the butts
in the seats where they belong.

159
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,680
And they loved it.

160
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,140
Now, what you guys got
in your festival

161
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,480
are turkeys

162
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,400
and not fresh turkeys either.

163
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,110
But here I am

164
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,570
the master chef
of showmanship

165
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,200
to teach you
how to turn those withered turkeys

166
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,660
into a memorable
moviegoing feast.

167
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,250
So, step right up
and we'll all get started.

Son of a gun.

All right, Leon, for the test,

204
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,900
- use the magnolia blossom.
- No, no,

205
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,280
- use the ambrosia.
- Yeah, yeah, something nice, okay?

206
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,490
- Okay! What odor pellets do we got?
- Okay, we have fish smell,

207
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,030
- locker room, road kill...
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,950

216
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,060

a fucking snow cone.

Vroom.

227
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,540
So, what are we gonna do
with the rest of this stuff, huh?

228
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,550
Dr. M said to store everything back here
until after the horrorthon.

229
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,920
Hello, what do we have here?

230
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,220
"Warning, do not open."

231
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,220
He didn't say anything
about a film.

232
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,970
Why does it have
a warning sticker on it?

233
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,470
It's probably a nitrate print.

234
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,930
Old movies were filmed on stock

235
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,600
- that was highly flammable.
- Yeah, sometimes they used to explode

236
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,020
when exposed to the air.

237
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,230
Knowledge entails risk.

238
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,900
Boom!

239
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,900
- What is it?
- I don't know.

240
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,410
It doesn't look very long.

241
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,620
- Wanna run it and find out?
- Why not?

242
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,510
Oh, must be a private eye flick.

243
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,090
Yuck, get the Visine.

244
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,400
We got a great cinematic mind
at work here.

245
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,730
Yeah, eat your heart out,

246
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,730
- Spielberg.
- I think this is funny.

247
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,910
Nice nose.

248
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,500
I am the possessor.

249
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,040
The possessor,
the possessor,

250
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,330
the possessor.

251
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
You said that.

252
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,590
I am the possess--

253
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,130
the possess--

254
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,800
possess--

255
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,350
possess...

256
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Oh, no, he's gonna do it.

257
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,430
- I don't believe it.
- Yes.

258
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
- He's gonna dolly up his nose.
- Yes, yes.

259
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,900
Come into...

260
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,030
my head.

261
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,370
- I'd rather not, thanks.
- Come into

262
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,250
my head.

263
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,760
Come into...

264
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,470
my head.

265
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,420
She's coming to.

266
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,000
Are you okay, Mag?

267
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,630
Yeah, Mag,
how many fingers I got up?

268
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,670
Will you move back
and let the girl breathe?

269
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,880
- What?
- I'm okay.

270
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,430
What was that movie?

271
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,640
Whatever it is,
it bites the big one.

272
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,140
No, no, no, really, what was it?

273
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,020
- I need to know.
- I don't know, but if it's that scary,

274
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,850
maybe we should show it
in the horrorthon.

275
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,020
Well, I'm not sure of all the facts,

276
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,690
but it's called "Possessor."

277
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,030
It was made by a guy
named Lanyard Gates.

278
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,820
He was, like, the head guru
of this film cult back in the '60s.

279
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,070
They used to drop acid

280
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,200
and make these weird
avant garde movies

281
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,790
of each other
staring into the camera

282
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,660
picking their noses,
stuff like that.

283
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,120
- You knew him?
- Oh, I bought into his rap for a while

284
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,170
until I actually saw
one of his films.

285
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,710
It was ludicrous.
The audience laughed it off the stage.

286
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,670
"Possessor" was his response.

287
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
How do you mean?

288
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,590
He didn't like
being laughed at

289
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,810
so he shot all of "Possessor"
except for the last scene.

290
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,850
When he showed the film,
he played the last scene live on stage.

291
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,690
He murdered his family
in front of the audience.

292
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,850
- What?
- Set fire to the theater,

293
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,190
locked the doors.

294
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,360
A lot of people were killed.

295
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,070
I always thought the film
went up in smoke, too,

296
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,820
but I guess
a fragment of it survived.

297
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,990
I think we should just turn it over
to the police.

298
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,910
- Yeah.
- Not a good idea for the horrorthon.

299
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,070
It's a total bummer.

300
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,370
I mean, who wants to see a film

301
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,370
where a guy really goes berserk
and kills his entire family?

302
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,710
- Mm.
- Exactly.

303
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,830
Back to Dr. M.

304
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,250
- All right.
- Really.

305
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,470
- Mom?
- Oh!

306
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,480
You scared me.

307
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,900
You all right?

308
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,940
Have you ever heard of this guy

309
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,440
named Lanyard Gates?

310
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,860
No, I don't think so.
Why?

311
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,740
Because we found
this film that he made, "Possessor."

312
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,790
Mom, I think that this is a man
that I've been dreaming about.

313
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,960
It's really weird.

314
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,250
Maggie,

315
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,260
I want you
to quit this festival.

316
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,680
I'm gonna get some tickets for us
down at the agency

317
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,680
and we'll go away together,
just the two of us.

318
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,930
What are you talking about?

319
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,560
I can't just take off like that.

320
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,270
Well, sure you can.

321
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,390
We never tied ourselves down
before.

322
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,190
And if these dreams
are starting again--

323
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,150
Mom, I'm not
gonna run away, okay?

324
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,530
I mean, I can't run away from something
that's inside of my head.

325
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,070
I know it sounds
completely off the wall,

326
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,330
but there's something
happening here

327
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,830
that I've been looking for
all of my life.

328
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,960
It's almost like
it's psychic or something.

329
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,500
Does that make any sense?

330
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,540
Yeah.

331
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
What's wrong?

332
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,180
Oh,

333
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,550
just every once in a while
I realize that you're all grown up

334
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,470
and I miss that little girl
you used to be.

335
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,680
That little girl
who used to need me so much.

336
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,690
- I gotta get to bed.
- Yeah.

337
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,190
- Good night.
- Good night, sweetie.

338
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,040
- Hello?
- The ninth circle of Hell

339
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,460
- is reserved for traitors.
- Who is this?

340
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,460
I am the possessed,

341
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,880
the possessed,
the possessed.

342
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,970
- Oh, my God.
- Soon, I will be the possessor.

343
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,600
I want her.

344
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,350
- I want her!
- No!

345
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,770
Well, then why don't we talk?

346
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,190
I'm in Dreamland.

347
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,950
And bring your nasty little gun
in case I turn my back again.

348
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,530
Coming soon

349
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,030
justice, retribution,

350
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,740
and death.

351
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,200
The film they tried to stop,
but couldn't.

352
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,120
Fifteen years in the making.

353
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,640
No.

354
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,470
No, Lanyard.

355
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,360
Lanyard.

356
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,160
Good-bye, Suzanne.

357
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,890
Stop!

358
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,430
Lanyard, you know I'll do it!

359
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Stop!

365
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,090
Look at me!

366
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,930

Pardon me.

What time
does the first show start?

376
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,580
Check the shock clock, ma'am.

377
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,830
When it screams,
a feature beams.

378
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,500
Sign the fright form, please.

381
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,510
Think of your families,
your mommies, your daddies,

382
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,140
- and Toto at home!
- Excuse me,

383
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,720
- it's time for his injection.
- Ah, no!

384
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,520
Not the needle!
I'm sorry, Nurse Ratched, I'll be good!

385
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,190
- Thanks.

Maggie.

391
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,590
Will these films be as shocking
as "Possessor," Sarah?

392
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,930
Two, please.

393
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,010
Hey, lady, where are you going?

All right, come on you guys.
Help support our film fest.

403
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,800
We are broke.
We can give you these T-shirts for $20.

404
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,470
Come on,
two T-shirts for $20.

405
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,380
Come on,
make your boyfriend buy you one.

406
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,600
Don't let him be cheap tonight.
Come on, you're a high roller.

407
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Come on, spend 20 bucks.

408
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,560
What do you want,
a large, a small?

409
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,600
No, you guys need a large.
This is a horrorthon.

410
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:29,270
- Yeah! Ooh, wah! Yeah!
- You're gonna be all night, okay?

411
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,200
Whoo!

412
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,930
Bring on the boos!

413
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,400
Come on, you've got two fives,
he's got a 10.

414
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,610
All right, come on, just spend
all your lunch money right here.

415
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,070
Come on, let's do it!

416
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,950
What in tarnation
could've done this, doc?

417
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,080
There's nary a drop of blood left
in any of my sheep.

418
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,830
Beats me, Skeeter.

419
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,160
Wait a minute.

420
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,460
Look at this large puncture wound
in the back of her neck.

421
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,960
Are you sure that's the neck?

422
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,130
Gross!

423
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,880
- I'll be right back.
- Somebody just...

424
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,720
- I'm gonna get some popcorn.
- ...stuck a big needle

425
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,510
or something in them
and just sucked the blood out.

426
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,300
Oh!

427
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,140
Someone or something.

428
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,900
Got the whole dang flock.

429
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,270
Even Effie.

430
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,110
Say, you don't think
there's any connection between this

431
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
and them underground tests

432
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,120
the Army's been conducting out here,
do you?

433
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,870
It's our army out there, Skeeter.

434
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,500
If we were in danger,
they'd have warned us.

435
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,040
- Toby.
- Hey, Mag.

436
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,750
I know this sounds
really crazy,

437
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,590
but I think I just saw
Lanyard Gates.

438
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,130
- Gates?
- Yes, I'm sure it was him.

439
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,880
He's older
and his face was burned,

440
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,970
but I'm sure it was him.

441
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,510
The guy from the "Possessor."

442
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,890
"Possessor"?

443
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,020
Maggie, all we saw was an eyeball
and a bad haircut.

444
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,020
How could you recognize anybody
from that?

445
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,810
I don't know how I knew
but I'm telling you it was him.

446
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,650
I just-- I know it.

447
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,480
Well, Mr. Davis did say
this guy Gates's body

448
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,440
was never officially identified.

449
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,400
He said it was a big fire

450
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,240
and the bodies were burned
beyond recognition,

451
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,240
- so maybe he could--
- So maybe he's still alive.

452
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,750
I mean, like, he could be just lurking
somewhere in this theater

453
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,420
just waiting to attack us!

454
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,580
- Sounds a little paranoid.
- This is great.

455
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,960
God, Toby, what a great movie
this would make!

456
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,300
We gotta find this guy.

457
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,720
Maggie,
maybe we should call the police.

458
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,010
Oh, yeah, right,
they come right on down here,

459
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,300
"Hello, officer, hi.

460
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,520
There was this guy
and he made this movie 15 years ago

461
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,390
and he, like, killed all these people
and everything

462
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,020
and we think
he's at our film festival,

463
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,650
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah."

464
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,230
All right.

465
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,150
Look, somebody's
gotta watch the booth.

466
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,150
- I'll take a look, okay?
- All right.

467
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,200
Hey, be careful.

468
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,380
Wait.

469
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,880
What-- what's that, Skeeter?

470
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,090
I-- I don't know,
but whatever it is,

471
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,260
it's getting too close!

472
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,230
Oh!

473
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,830
Get it off!

474
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,090
Skeeter, oh, God!

475
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,850
Skeeter!

476
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,500
Now, tell me
this whole thing again.

477
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,590
And spell it out for me
this time.

478
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,970
- I'm simpleminded.
- And you're ugly, too!

479
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,930
The radiation...

480
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,300
...from the underground atomic tests

481
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,430
stimulated the mosquito's growth
far beyond its normal size.

482
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,890
Latimer, you're a very good vet

483
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,060
and a very pretty lady.

484
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,310
But a mosquito capable
of that kind of destruction

485
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,150
would have to be
as big as a house.

486
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,610
- Excuse me, Lieutenant, sir.
- What is it, Corky?

487
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
We got an emergency
over at Fielding's Pond, sir.

488
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,700
Folks over there
are saying that big larva

489
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,910
are breeding in the water.

490
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,450
Yeah, well, we got people
breeding in the balcony!

491
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,630
...here sooner,
we could've gotten them all at the pond.

492
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,880
We got all but one?

493
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,800
Yes, ma'am,
but that's the mother.

494
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,550
If I'm right
and she comes back here,

495
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,760
then maybe we--
we've got a chance.

496
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,550
Say, Doc...

497
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,310
Boo!

498
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,720
Ow.

499
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,480
Mark! Damn it, you scared me.

500
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,650
- Are you okay?
- Mm.

501
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,320
Well, if I was a 10-ton mosquito,
I wouldn't waste all my time

502
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,690
sucking through all them sheep.

503
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
No, sir.

504
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,780
I'd head straight for the blood bank.

505
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,070
Okay, Corky, go keep a lookout.

506
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,570
If you see anything coming,
holler loud and clear.

507
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,700
You got it, sir.

508
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,920
So, uh, tell me,

509
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,710
is there a, uh, Mr. Latimer?

510
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,510
Not yet.

511
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,130
Is there a Mrs. Bradley?

512
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,970
Yeah.

513
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,600
She lives in Kansas.

514
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,270
Bakes apple pie.

515
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,440
- I call her Mom.
- Whoo!

516
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,070
Hey, no tongues!

517
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,530
No tongues!

518
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,280
Careful, Jim.

519
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,700
The female mosquito
is the dangerous one.

520
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,530
Just thought I should let you know
what you're in for.

521
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,160
Thanks for the warning.

522
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,250
Mayday, Mayday!

523
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,420
Come on, bugs.

524
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,670
I saw the thing up in the sky!

525
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,250
It's bigger than ever
and it's headed right this way.

526
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,800
Holy cow,
get Washington on the phone pronto.

527
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,130
It's picked up the scent
of the plasma.

528
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,140
Its proboscis is aimed right at us!

529
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,510
Send the Air Force,
Mr. President.

530
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,640
Don't forget the Army, Navy,
and the Coast Guard.

531
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,600
How about the police dogs
while you're at it?

532
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,230
We need every plane, tank,
and battleship

533
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,520
you've got, Mr. President.

534
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,310
This is one hell of a bug.

535
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,810
Thank you, sir.

536
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,150
God bless you, too.

537
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,410
I'm scared, Lieutenant.

538
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,040
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

539
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,870
I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

540
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,500
- Jim, it's leaving!
- Amen!

541
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Yahoo!

542
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,650
Nothing fazes it.
We'll have to drop the A-bomb.

543
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,990
No, Jim, that's what started
all this trouble in the first place.

544
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,580
Five, four, three,

545
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,540
- two, one.
- Everybody, under the desk!

546
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,210
Whoo!

547
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,290
Five, four, three...

548
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,130
Bye-bye!

549
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,100
Go, baby, go, go!

550
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,210
What the?

551
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,300
It's dead.

552
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:02,510
Wow, incinerated beyond belief!

553
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,150
- Thanks, guys.
- You're welcome, Corky!

554
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,480
We're safe this time, Jim.

555
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,650
There may be a next time.

556
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,280
And a next.

557
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,030
Do you know
how many species of insects

558
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,660
there are in this world?

559
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,290
Mankind must learn
to be ever watchful.

560
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,130
I know one thing, baby.

561
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:40,170
From now on,
I'm gonna be watching you.

562
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,510
Amen.

563
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,110
So, let me get this straight,

564
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,150
this guy Gates,
like, come back from the dead

565
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,950
to show some flick he made and, like,
walked up to the movie theater

566
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,360
and bought a ticket like that?

567
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,320
Am I getting this right
or am I just delirious?

568
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,990
I didn't say
that he came back from the dead.

569
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,750
Right, right, but, well,
this Sarah thing-- run that by me again.

570
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,870
He called me Sarah.

571
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,080
Maybe he thinks I'm his daughter.

572
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,750
Oh. Oh, so Gates
has a daughter named Sarah?

573
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,510
- Yes!
- And we know this how?

574
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,050
I don't know, Mark,
but I kn-- ugh.

575
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,430
You're pissing me off.

576
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,140
Well, enjoy your little joke?

577
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,310
- What?
- Locking me out of the theater.

578
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,190
I had to climb down the fire escape
and into the side yard.

579
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,770
I fell in a trash bin.

580
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,980
I twisted my ankle while climbing
the barbed wire fence,

581
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,150
outrunning
a very pissed off Doberman.

582
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,820
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have to change reels.

583
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,030
Toby, I didn't do anything,
I swear it.

584
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
- Oh, yeah? Well, who did, then, huh?
- Don't look at me.

585
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,040
- Maybe it was him.
- Who?

586
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,960
- You-- you mean Gates?
- It could be!

587
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh, so Gates came back from the dead
to lock Toby out of the theater.

588
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,050
Oh, yeah.

589
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,880
That's real cute, Mark.

590
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,590
Come on, Maggie.

591
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,970
I'm only fooling around.

592
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,550
Great, why don't you fool around
with Joy, then?

593
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,930
Get out of here.

594
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,790
- How many?
- Just one.

595
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,590
- Hi.
- Did you have a nice break?

596
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,420
- I'm really sorry. Thanks.
- Yeah. Later.

597
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,510
- Great, there you go.
- Thanks.

598
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,850
Two popcorns, please.

599
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,970
What's up, player?

600
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,850
Don't ask.

601
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,060
The prisoner will stand.

602
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,060
There being no legal cause

603
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,610
why a sentence
should not be pronounced...

604
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,280
Your Honor,
the defense would like the court

605
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,740
to consider the fact...

606
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,990
Joy, what's the story?

607
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:58,660
Hey, I tried to save it for you,
but you were gone for so long.

608
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,170
- ...the court would be lenient.
- Hey, man, you're in my seat.

609
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,840
It is the judgment
and sentence of this court...

610
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,840
Eat shit, asshole.

611
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,220
...that for the crime
of murder in the first degree...

612
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,380
You wanna repeat that, pal?

613
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,050
Huh?

614
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:20,850
I said eat shit, asshole.

615
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,400
And may God have mercy
on your soul.

616
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,900
Whoo-hoo!

617
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,110
Ooh, nice shot, dude.

618
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,410
Oh.

619
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,240
Isn't Mr. Davis here?

620
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,410
He's backstage.
Will you tell him I need him?

621
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,750
What for?

622
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,750
Every one of these buttons here
represents a wired seat down there.

623
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,040
They're supposed to go off
in automatic sequence,

624
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,630
only I don't know
how to set the timer.

625
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,630
So in the meanwhile, I'm gonna
have to zap everybody manually.

626
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,220
That's fascinating, Bud.
I'll tell him.

627
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,050
- Tell me...
- Tell him, then.

628
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,850
...what do you know
about erythrocytes and leukocytes?

629
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,940
Say, aren't those the red and white
corpuscles in the blood?

630
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,230
Very good, Vernon.

631
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,200
I have created a third corpuscle--

632
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,320
the "magnecyte."

633
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,660
Theoretically, it can regenerate
the blood cells

634
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,960
even after severe trauma,
any trauma.

635
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,920
Even electrocution.

636
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:28,840
I get it.

637
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,670
You want to inject me
with this corpuscle

638
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,180
to see if I can survive the chair,
is that it?

639
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,470
Exactly.

640
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,430
There's this mystery in her own life

641
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,220
that she hasn't solved yet,
which--

642
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,680
Sarah, wake up.

643
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,350
Your life has been a dream.

644
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,320
You are possessed.

645
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,280
Mark!

646
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,530
Sorry!

647
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,280
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to talk to you.

648
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,950
Hey, listen, you remember
that guy Gates?

649
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,580
I can prove that he was here.

650
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,670
When we were gone,
he came into the box office

651
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,330
and he left a message
on my recorder.

652
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,380
Listen. Shit!

653
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,170
Shit, I must've smashed it
into the door.

654
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,340
Tina was here.
I bet she saw him.

655
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,800
Cheryl, did you see
where Tina went?

656
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,350
- Check with Bud. He might know.
- Great.

657
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,760
It's time, Vernon.

658
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,720
I'm ready, Warden.

659
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,150
So long, Vernon.

660
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,150
Adios, Big Gil.

661
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,150
Warm it up for me,
Vernon.

662
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,570
Anytime, Maxie.

663
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,580
Hey, Vernon,
whatever they tell you, don't sit down!

664
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,500
I'll keep that in mind, Otis.

665
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,330
Vernon, when you get to heaven,

666
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,080
will you tell my ma
I said hello?

667
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,090
I ain't going to heaven,
Bobby.

668
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,880
But I'll sure be glad
to say hello to your daddy.

669
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,300
Mr. Davis?

670
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,350
Hey, that mosquito gag
was great.

671
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,150
Hey, Bud, where's Tina?

672
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
Jesus, you almost made me
zap the third row.

673
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,150
Cheryl said
she was up here with you.

674
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,700
Well, she's looking for Davis.
Check backstage.

675
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:23,160
Hey, you'll need this.

676
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,870
Thanks.

677
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,790
Sauté the sucker!

678
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,840
Fry him!

679
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:41,550
- Fry him!
- Make mine medium rare!

680
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,890
Fry him! Fry him!

681
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,770
All right, kids,
here comes Dr. Zap.

682
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,690
Any last words?

683
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,030
See you later.

684
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:11,250
And away we go.

685
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,300
Bingo!

686
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,260
Boop!

687
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,850
Attention,
hemorrhoid sufferers...

688
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:35,770
You, sir, have just received
the Ted Bundy award.

689
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,070
Yes!

690
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,240
Ah, this is fun.
I like doing this.

691
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,530
Boo!

692
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,170
Bud needs you.

693
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,090
And by the way, so do I.

694
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,550
Your lip, it's peeling.

695
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,260
Nerves.

696
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,140
How about a quickie
right here

697
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,230
with just that little screen between us
and public exposure?

698
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,310
Everybody always wonders
how I get those straight As.

699
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,270
I keep telling them
I do lots of extra credit assignments.

700
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,700
My God,
he's still breathing.

701
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,000
Mm!

702
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,580
What can we do?

703
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,660
Get Washington on the line.

704
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,290
Pronto.

705
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,470
I don't see him.

706
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,230
Shoot.

707
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,770
I see you.

708
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,940
Wow, Maggie.
Maggie, check this out.

709
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,990
Tina, you scared me.

710
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,780
Are you okay?

711
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,530
Mm-hmm.

712
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,830
Shh.

713
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,280
Audience.

714
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:55,660
Right, um,
what are you doing up here?

715
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,210
Securing the mosquito.

716
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,920
Hey, listen,
did you see anybody

717
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,090
come into the box office
after I left?

718
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,300
Mr. Davis.

719
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,880
Where'd he go?

720
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,630
He just left.

721
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,220
Damn it.

722
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,050
Well, maybe
I could still catch him.

723
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,390
Tina should start eating better.
She looks like shit.

724
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,810
Bye.

725
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,940
- How's the movie?
- Too scary for me.

726
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,940
I need some popcorn
to calm me down.

727
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,440
Thank God it's not fattening.

728
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,320
And a Milky Way, too, please.

729
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,910
- Joannie!
- Cheryl!

730
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:33,080
I am not having any butter
on my popcorn

731
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,330
and you can get me a diet Pepsi
so it all balances out in the end.

732
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,370
Yeah, that's exactly where
it's gonna balance out-- in your end.

733
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,710
He must be able
to change his appearances.

734
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,090
- Who? What?
- Mark!

735
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,340
Now we're gonna have to walk

736
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,670
- all the way around the building.
- Shit.

737
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,840
Yeah, who did you say
could change his appearances?

738
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,010
Gates.
I saw him buy a ticket.

739
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:54,260
But Tina just said it was Davis
who came into the box office.

740
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,310
Now, she wouldn't have let Gates in
unless she thought he was somebody else,

741
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,680
somebody that she knew.

742
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,440
So, obviously,
he must disguise himself.

743
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,690
Oh, no, wait, no disguise
looks that real that close up.

744
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,110
Maybe.

745
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,860
Wait a minute.

746
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,740
Hmm, this is Davis's car.
That's his briefcase.

747
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:12,910
He must still be inside.

748
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:15,990
Maggie, who are we looking for,
Davis or Gates?

749
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,250
If Gates is walking around
disguised as Davis,

750
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:21,420
that probably means
there isn't a Davis.

751
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,750
- I'm gonna go find--
- Wait, wait, hold it, hold it,

752
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,500
let's just cut to the lot
like Toby did, remember?

753
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,340
- What do you mean? There's a fence.
- So we'll climb it.

754
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,210
- But there's a barbed wire fence.
- Maggie, we'll fly over it, all right?

755
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,380
Will you just trust me?

756
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,090
Wait, Mark, Toby said
he got attacked by a guard dog.

757
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,060
Babe, any guard dog
that Toby can handle,

758
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,890
Mark can handle, too, okay?

759
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,060
Come on.

760
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,730
Hey, Tina,
have you found Davis yet?

761
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,610
Oh, yes.

762
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,910
Hey! What the--

763
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,870
Hey!

764
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,290
This is cute, Tina,
but I have a cue in five minutes.

765
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,250
Oh, okay.

766
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,920
Very kinky.
What do you-- oh!

767
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,000
What's going on here?

768
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:09,380
Tina! Mm!

769
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,760
Mm!

770
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,590
Stop right there, man.

771
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,900
Hey, Bobby,

772
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,400
get a load
of this crazy cat.

773
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,650
Yeah, bird brain.

774
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,200
We're addressing you.

775
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:04,640
Whoo!

776
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,810
Well, Bud,

777
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,030
you'll get a charge out of this.

778
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,230
Watch the panel.

779
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,570
The lights will go on
in the following order--

780
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,320
red, blue, green.

781
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:21,490
Or is that green, blue--

782
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,950
oh, I forget.

783
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,500
But the important light
is that yellow one.

784
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,250
When it turns on, Bud,
so do you.

785
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,500
All right, big guy.

786
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,470
Come to papa.

787
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,060
Hey, he's got Ritchie!

788
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:49,480
Let go of Ritchie, man!

789
00:50:58,410 --> 00:50:59,780
Richie!

790
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,880
Oh, my God, what happened to him?

791
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,430
He fell off this fence
and there was this Doberman.

792
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,050
Yeah, forget about that,
all right?

793
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,390
No big deal.

794
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,770
Whoa, this is a job
for Nurse Joannie.

795
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,060
- Hey, I'm fine.
- Bend over.

796
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,650
He's coming this way.

797
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,980
Kiss me, Dick.

798
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,610
Kiss your what?

799
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,410
- All done.
- Have you guys seen Davis?

800
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:41,620
No.

801
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,080
Let's go talk to Bud.

802
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,830
Give me a hand.

803
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,370
- Watch the candy counter.
- I love it.

804
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,040
No, Vernon.

805
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,750
Have you heard, Peggy?

806
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,050
I'm high voltage these days.

807
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:00,550
Always been high voltage
to me, Vernon.

808
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,930
Pucker up, baby!

809
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,230
Well, well.

810
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,570
- What do we have here?
- Burn him dead!

811
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,950
Burn the guy dead!

812
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:24,200
It's great!
They're eating it up in there!

813
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,830
I know, I cannot believe
the stunts actually worked.

814
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,540
- And now that we are alone.
- Um, sure.

815
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,250
Come on!
Come on, darling, run!

816
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,260
Be happy, Dick,
and remember me.

817
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,090
But--

818
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,830
What the hell's going on?

819
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,540
This is not scheduled.

820
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,030
Wow.

821
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,490
Leon, this is weird.

822
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:45,820
Was all this
supposed to happen?

823
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,660
No, I don't think so.

824
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,120
Okay, okay, we've gotta turn the lights
back on.

825
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:51,450
What?
I don't know from lights.

826
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,210
- That's Toby's department.
- This is a blackout.

827
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,960
There are a thousand people
inside there, Leon.

828
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,250
They'll riot.

829
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,920
The band!

830
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:59,210
- Good idea.
- Where are they?

831
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,750
- The green room. Okay.
- Let's go.

832
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,340
- Now, what the hell was that?
- I don't know.

833
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,720
Don't let go.
You might fall down the st--

834
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,340
Shit.

835
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,390
Shit!
I'll get him. Mark!

836
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,680
Talk to me.

837
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,480
- Are you okay?
- Fine, fine!

838
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,850
Just don't step on my hand!

839
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,810
Oh, jeez.
I'm gonna go talk to Bud.

840
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,860
Ladies and gentlemen,
we hope to be off auxiliary power soon

841
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,190
and get back to the movie.

842
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,200
Meanwhile,
let's bring out the band!

Bud?

850
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:23,800
Bud.

851
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,980
Sarah.

852
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,860
- Oh, my God.
- What, no kiss for daddy?

853
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,190
- Who are you?
- Oh, that hurts.

854
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,280
There's so great a wound
as an ungrateful child.

855
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:52,660
I'm not Sarah.
I'm not your daughter.

856
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,490
I'm not your child.

857
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,750
Oh, yes.

858
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,120
Think.

859
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:02,420
An altar, a sword,

860
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:05,250
Mommy dearest.

861
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,630
The fire,

862
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,970
a gunshot.

863
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:13,470
And now it's time
to join your mother.

864
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:16,850
No!

865
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:30,700
Sarah.

866
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,960
Sarah!

867
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,340
Sarah.

868
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,090
Sarah.

869
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,940
Sarah.

870
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:35,220
Sarah.

871
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,150
Oh! Hey!

872
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,030
Hey, hey!

873
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:52,860
Maggie, what's the matter?

874
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,950
Oh, my God.
Gates just tried to kill me.

875
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:59,330
He killed Bud
and maybe Tina and Davis, too.

876
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:01,620
Toby,

877
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:03,750
he's my father.

878
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,210
I remember.

879
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,880
I remember the whole thing.

880
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,920
Wait, Maggie.

881
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,050
Shit.

882
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,760
My, my, my.

883
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:21,010
And what could you two be doing
all alone in the dark?

884
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,770
Come on,

892
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,890
Toby,

893
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:01,100
it's not a screenplay
that I've been writing.

894
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,850
It's my life.

895
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,600
My unconscious
has been trying to make me

896
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:09,730
relive my past
so that I would remember it.

897
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,480
I'm Sarah Gates.

898
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,690
I'm not Maggie Butler.

899
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,990
Suzanne's not my mother,
she's my aunt.

900
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,950
My mother's name
was Gloria.

901
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,370
My father killed her
the night that he showed "Possessor."

902
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,250
He tried to kill me, too,
but Suzanne stopped it.

903
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:28,620
She shot him
and she saved me

904
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,710
and I don't know,
somehow we got away.

905
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,750
She changed our names
and our identities

906
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,630
to protect me.

907
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,800
From Gates?

908
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:39,050
Well, his body
was never found,

909
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,090
so nobody could ever prove
that he was dead.

910
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,680
She never knew
when he'd come back.

911
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:45,890
Now he's here.

912
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,770
Why, Maggie?

913
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,980
To finish the film.

914
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,810
And to kill me.

915
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,320
God, Toby.

916
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,150
My brain is just,
like, reeling.

917
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,990
Hey.

918
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,660
Hey.

919
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,500
Hey, I'm here for you, Maggie,
all the way.

920
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,710
Come on.

921
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,590
Let's get
the lights turned on, huh?

922
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,710
We gotta call the police.

923
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,050
Okay,
but let's do this first, huh?

924
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,600
Well, down the rabbit hole.

925
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,720
- The rabbit hole?
- And into Wonderland.

926
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,100
That's a little humor there.

927
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,940
It's the only way
to get to the circuit breakers.

928
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:37,280
- Whoa!
- Toby!

929
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,240
Are you all right?

930
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,410
Toby!

931
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:45,030
Toby!

932
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,460
Toby, where are you?

933
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,120
Toby?

934
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,890
Mr. Davis!

935
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:05,640
Mr. Davis?

936
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,390
Toby?

937
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,230
- Sarah.
- Tina?

938
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,320
Tina, is-- is that you?

939
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:21,490
Tina!

940
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:24,780
Sarah.

941
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,540
Oh!

942
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,710
Stop!

943
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,840
Stop. Please.

944
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,720
Stop, please!

945
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:49,810
Welcome home.

01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:54,770

Okay, we got our lights back on.
Let's get on with the show!

951
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,620
Whoo!

952
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,740
Who are you?

953
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:49,870
I'm Toby.

954
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,200
Or-- or nearly Toby.

955
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,250
You'll have to forgive the...

956
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:57,870
sloppy craftsmanship.

957
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,250
Actually,
it takes hours every morning

958
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,840
to prepare the perfect Toby
for the world to see.

959
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:08,470
In truth, I've perfected
the quick transition

960
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,180
from face to face.

961
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:14,020
Of course,
I have to borrow their faces to do it.

962
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:18,270
You might say
I'm "multidentical."

963
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:27,780
Now, with a little nip here
and a little tuck there

964
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:30,070
I become "multisexual."

965
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,780
Nothing new about that, huh?

966
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,990
And as you've heard with the help
of electronic voice harmonics,

967
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,830
I become Tina,
the class bimbo.

968
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,340
I can look like
anybody I want to.

969
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,880
It's one of the few advantages
of not having a face.

970
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,930
- Then you're not...
- Your father?

971
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,510
No.

972
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,180
Lanyard Gates is dead.

973
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:59,980
Died in the fire
15 years ago.

974
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,810
If you're Toby,
why are you...

975
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,320
Why am I going to kill you?
Is that your question?

976
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,190
- Why are you doing this?
- Oh!

977
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,530
Good question.

978
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,830
Same answer, actually.

979
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:15,790
See,

980
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:20,000
I was caught
in that fire, too.

981
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:25,500
My mother
was in Lanyard's so-called film cult.

982
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:28,510
We were sitting
in the front row

983
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:32,140
when your Aunt Suzanne
shot Lanyard

984
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,510
and set fire to the theater.

985
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,930
You, luckily, got out.

986
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,650
We, unluckily,

987
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:45,940
did not.

988
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:47,480
My mother died.

989
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:52,490
I lost most of the flesh
on my body.

990
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:57,620
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, are you?

991
01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:00,370
Well, that makes it
all right, then!

992
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,580
Here, I'll just let you go.

993
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:04,750
You're sorry?

994
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,880
Look at me!

995
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:13,470
This is your work!

996
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,390
Don't like it, huh?

997
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,260
You don't have to look!

998
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:19,430
Don't look!

999
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,140
Don't look at me!

1000
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,730
I was a child, too, Toby!

1001
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,810
You were a child?
Good.

1002
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:28,480
I was a child.
We were all children.

1003
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:32,360
Nobody was a child like me.

1004
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:33,950
Nobody.

1005
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,990
Shall I describe the--
the years of surgery

1006
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,660
I went through, huh?

1007
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:41,870
The skin grafts,
the prosthetic pieces.

1008
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,040
I had to glue on my face
all through school

1009
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:47,290
every day of my life

1010
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,460
so the other kids
wouldn't scream.

1011
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:52,970
Nobody saw me coming, huh?

1012
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:56,590
Here, I'll show you
how it works.

1013
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,010
Now, the first thing we do

1014
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:02,600
is we cover up
these fried egg eyes

1015
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:04,520
with contact lenses.

1016
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,320
Lovely.

1017
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,700
Toby.

1018
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:20,910
Ah.

1019
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:24,160
Now a new nose.

1020
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,080
There.

1021
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:31,050
- Please stop.
- Then we prepare a face

1022
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,920
to meet the faces
that we meet.

1023
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,050
A lovely chin.

1024
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:41,140
Yeah.

1025
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:49,860
It's my Scarecrow in Oz face.

1026
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,480
Cute, huh?

1027
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,570
You're crazy.

1028
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:58,530
What,
this just dawned on you?

1029
01:06:58,700 --> 01:06:59,740
That's great.

1030
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:02,080
And I'm the one who's crazy.

1031
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,210
Can't say I've lost
my sense of humor, can you?

1032
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,580
Toby.

1033
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,300
What are you gonna do?

1034
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:15,800
Mm, here's my plan.

1035
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:19,430
I've thought it out
with geometric logic.

1036
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:24,180
I'm going to recreate
that showing of "Possessor"

1037
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:29,060
only this time,
it's going exactly as planned.

1038
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,900
And maybe that way,
things will be different.

1039
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:38,320
Maybe,
then my mother won't die...

1040
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:41,910
and I won't be burned.

1041
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:47,120
And everything will be okay.

1042
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:50,960
That makes perfect sense.

1043
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:54,170
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1044
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:04,470
- Yuck!
- Oh, pee-yew, what is that?

1045
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,020
Hmm, I don't know.
Could be swamp gas.

1046
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:10,560
Well, it doesn't smell like
swamp gas to me.

1047
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:13,230
Well, it's not me.

1048
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,650
I'm not so sure.

1049
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,860
Well, whatever it is,
it's getting worse.

1050
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:18,070
Yuck.

1051
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,610
Mark, if you keep this up,

1052
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,740
you're gonna have to hire
your own private nurse before long.

1053
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:23,620
There you are,
you son of a bitch!

1054
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:25,490
Oh, no.

1055
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:28,960
- I wanna go home now.
- Hi, Joy.

1056
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,630
Look, I'm sorry,
but Maggie had some problems

1057
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:33,790
and I had to help her out.

1058
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,760
Maggie? What, are you
obsessed with this bitch or what?

1059
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,590
God, I knew you didn't have any brains,
but I thought you had some taste.

1060
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,970
Why don't you just cool out?

1061
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:47,390
Why don't you just
shut your little mouth, you little slut?

1062
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,980
And as far as Maggie goes,

1063
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,140
I saw her leave here
with that little film nerd.

1064
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:52,440
- What's his name?
- Toby?

1065
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,860
Yeah, that's right, Toby.

1066
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:56,360
I caught them in the dark
and they were going at it.

1067
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,730
They were hot and heavy.

1068
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,030
And you wouldn't believe it,
they're on their way to his house.

1069
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,820
You're full of shit.

1070
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:04,490
Hey, asshole!

1071
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:05,910
Oh, no.

1072
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,000
Uh-oh.
- You got a problem?

1073
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,130
I said you got a problem?

1074
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,130
- No, do you?
- He hit me. Kick his ass!

1075
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,630
- Kick his ass!
- Uh-uh, wait, wait, wait,

1076
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,670
wait a minute,
this boy's been getting beat up all day.

1077
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,300
- You want him, you gotta go through me.
- I don't hit chicks. Now back off!

1078
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:26,100
You don't hit chicks?
You swear to God?

1079
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:28,470
I ain't never hit a chick
in my life.

1080
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,310
That's all I wanted to know.

1081
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,520
Rad!

1082
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,560
- I could've done that.
- You bitch!

1083
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:37,690
- Oh, my hair!
- Punk-ass blonde bitch!

1084
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:40,480
- Get your sorry ass out of here.
- You're messing with my hair!

1085
01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:44,410
- It's not your hair anyway!
- I'm gonna bust your butt, bad boy.

1086
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:51,040
God damn it!

1087
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,290
- I got you, wimp! You ain't shit!
- Oh! He's going for the side door!

1088
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,080
I can't believe
she went to Toby's house.

1089
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,250
Toby and Maggie,
are you crazy?

1090
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,920
- You believe that dumb bitch?
- You guys know where Toby lives?

1091
01:10:01,090 --> 01:10:04,300
48 Crescent Road, apartment 7-3
about five blocks away.

1092
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,840
Believe it.

1093
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:10,390
She's the world's authority
on Toby D'Amato.

1094
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,730
- Use the side door.
- Right.

1095
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:15,270
Oh, my God, my stench cue!
I'm late.

1096
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,860
Almost time.

1097
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,820
Lanyard Gates
began "Possessor" at midnight.

1098
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,360
and we will follow
in his footsteps.

1099
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:26,570
Wait, I forgot
the other member

1100
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,820
of the original cast.

1101
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:31,540
- Ta-da!
- Mom?

1102
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,540
Sarah, Mom.

1103
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,920
Mom, Sarah.

1104
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:44,510
Maggie, forgive me.

1105
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:46,220
Hey, sure, why not?

1106
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:49,550
All she did was murder your father,
destroy his life's work,

1107
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,260
and then lie to you
your whole life.

1108
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:54,430
Sure, say a couple of Hail Marys
and forget the whole thing.

1109
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,770
Maggie, he was giving you acid.
I had to get you out.

1110
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:00,270
Liar, liar,
face on fire, face on fire!

1111
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,940
Toby, don't do this, please!

1112
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:06,240
- Toby!
- Lanyard Gates was crazy!

1113
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,490
I am rubber, you're glue.

1114
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,950
Everything that you're saying
bounces off me and sticks on you!

1115
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,080
- Toby, no!
- Sticks on you!

1116
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,660
Sticks on you,
sticks on you, sticks on you.

1117
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:17,580
Oh.

1118
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,590
Half an hour to midnight.

1119
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,760
I still have
a little time to kill.

1120
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,130
Hmm.

1121
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:33,640
Where the hell
have you been?

1122
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:35,680
- Get the odor pellets.
- Okay. Which one goes first?

1123
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:37,520
- I forgot.
- Body odor.

1124
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,810
- That's disgusting.
- No, it's not B.O.

1125
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,940
It's body odor
as in the odor of a dead body.

1126
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:43,320
Oh, much better.

1127
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,230
Anyway, I wanna get back
to what I was saying.

1128
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,400
Yeah, just hold that thought, okay?
I gotta take a leak first.

1129
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:50,030
- We've got a cue coming up.
- We got five minutes.

1130
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:41,960
Hey! Hey!
Let me out!

1131
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,290
This isn't funny!

1132
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,090
Oh, shit!

1133
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:54,260
No! Please, no!

1134
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:09,690
Took you long enough.

1135
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:12,530
- I had some gas.
- Spare me the details.

1136
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,870
Anyway,
what do you think?

1137
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:17,700
- About what?
- Toby.

1138
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,290
Does he like me?

1139
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,670
Like you?

1140
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:25,960
What's wrong with your voice?
You sound so weird.

1141
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:30,130
- I got a frog in my throat.
- Sounds like a crocodile.

1142
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,930
Anyway, I need to know.

1143
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:36,010
I mean, I'm walking around
madly in love with this guy

1144
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,010
and he just acts like
I don't even exist.

1145
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,270
You're impartial.
What's your opinion?

1146
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:42,270
Is he shy or what?

1147
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:45,520
Look, I've got my own problems.
Just leave me alone, all right?

1148
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:49,070
Men.

1149
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:50,820
Admit it,
you fucked up.

1150
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:56,410
Don't you-- I got--
I got problems of my own here!

1151
01:13:56,570 --> 01:14:00,080
Don't you--
don't you talk about love to me!

1152
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,460
We're gonna make a movie here!

1153
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:09,130
Come on, baby.

1154
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,840
Wait, it's getting stronger.

1155
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:18,640
Ooh, my nose is burning!

1156
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:21,350
Well, I don't know
what you're doing,

1157
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,850
but I'm getting out of here.

1158
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,020
Good idea.
Let's head for camp.

1159
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,530
My lungs are burning!

1160
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,610
Hey, my legs won't move!

1161
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,370
I can't see!
I can't see!

1162
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,330
Just a normal life

1163
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:42,660
filled with normal happiness.

1164
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:45,000
Hmm, normal sadness.

1165
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,710
Normal family stuff.

1166
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,960
Normal kids of my own.

1167
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:54,920
Do you know
how amazing normal stuff seems

1168
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,300
when there's no chance
you'll ever have it for yourself?

1169
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:03,970
And whose fault
was that, huh?

1170
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:08,400
Whose fault was that,
nasty Suzanne?

1171
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,860
Nasty Suzanne
and her nasty gun.

1172
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:14,900
Bang, bang
went nasty Suzanne.

1173
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:17,700
Bang, bang
went her nasty gun.

1174
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:22,030
Well-- well, not this time,
Ms. Pretty Skin.

1175
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,250
Go ahead.
Go ahead, try it, huh?

1176
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,170
No, huh? No.

1177
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,050
I am so glad
I cast you in this part.

1178
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:55,650
If you don't stop it soon,

1179
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,150
there's no telling
what might happen.

1180
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,570
Hmm, I fear you are right...

1181
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:04,330
Better get Tokyo
on the line, pronto.

1182
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:12,460
Who the hell are you?

1183
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:15,090
I'm a friend of Toby's.
Is he here?

1184
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,880
If he was here, he'd be dead.
Look at this place.

1185
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:20,180
You say
you're a friend of his?

1186
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,840
I ought to kill you.

1187
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:23,390
Maybe that'd make me feel
a little better.

1188
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,850
What did he do?

1189
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,680
What did he do?
What the hell did he do?

1190
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,980
Jesus Christ,
what the hell didn't he do?

1191
01:16:31,150 --> 01:16:33,650
The guy's
a goddamn lunatic.

1192
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:36,650
Should've thrown his ass out
six months ago.

1193
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:39,190
Yelling and screaming
all night long

1194
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,950
at the top of his lungs.

1195
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:44,070
Never let anybody in the place.
Oh, I only wonder why.

1196
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,200
- Look at all this shit.
- What?

1197
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:48,290
The goddamn smell.
I mean, it's just--

1198
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:50,960
- Oh, my God.
- it was like some chemical smell.

1199
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:55,670
I had to break
the goddamn door down to get in here

1200
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,170
- because the tub overflowed...
- Oh, no.

1201
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:59,470
...and it flooded
the apartment downstairs.

1202
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,220
You know--
you know what he's got in that tub?

1203
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:07,140
He's got-- he's got things
that look like human skulls

1204
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:09,220
and-- and body parts.

1205
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:13,440
Probably some-- some kind of
Jack the Ripper or something.

1206
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,520
Ah, son of a bitch.

1207
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:20,280
What are you doing?

1208
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,910
Just say yes.

1209
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:24,320
Toby!

1210
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:27,080
Anyway, that's what
I gotta say about him.

1211
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,960
Yeah, look at that.
The guy can't paint either.

1212
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,210
Isn't that
a real piece of crap there?

1213
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:39,420
Hey! That's Gloria Gates!

1214
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:41,340
I did a picture with her.

1215
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:42,970
You're a director?

1216
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:44,840
Hey, listen,
you're a director?

1217
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:49,350
I-I'm an actor.
You wanna take a picture or résumé?

1218
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:53,100
Well, how about we do lunch?

1219
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:02,740
It came from outer space.

1220
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:05,950
We know that now.
We must be ever vigilant and never rest.

1221
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:09,080
Keep our eyes on the heavens
or the stench will--

1222
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,370
♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪

1223
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,160
♪ And have ourselves a treat... ♪

1224
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:14,370
...into the shelter.

1225
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,330
This place can only be avoided
if we can get to the--

1226
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,590
- Come on!
- Boo!

1227
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:32,180
I am the possessor.

1228
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:35,350
- Who put this junk on?
- Where's Toby? Do something!

1229
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,230
- Do what?
- The projection booth!

1230
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:45,110
Yeah, it stinks,
doesn't it?

1231
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,160
Ooh, I hate this movie.

1232
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:49,780
Yeah, thumbs down
on this movie.

1233
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:51,790
Ooh, I hate this movie.

1234
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:54,040
Hate this movie! Ugh!

1235
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,080
- Get this movie off the screen!
- Hey, fix your makeup, dude.

1236
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,330
Yeah, yours is a bitch, too.

1237
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,710
Get it on!
Get on with this movie!

1238
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:05,170
Okay.
Okay, this should stop it.

1239
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,930
- It's not stopping.
- Cheryl, make it stop!

1240
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:10,930
What do you want me to do,
stick my hand in it? Stop!

1241
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,430
Sweet, dreamy Sarah.

1242
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,810
You've stolen my heart.

1243
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:21,480
Oh, what have we here?

1244
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:25,400
Oh, I hope I got your size.

1245
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:29,450
And you thought Iron Maiden
was a heavy metal band.

1246
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,840
I am so glad that you have finally
remembered everything

1247
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,670
because, you know,
with-- without memory,

1248
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:48,510
there can be no retribution.

1249
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,760
Open up!

1250
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:52,680
Shit.

1251
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:11,950
Ah.

1252
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,620
- Lovely.
- No.

1253
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:21,710
Now, are we finally ready?

1254
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:24,090
Can we shoot this thing?

1255
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,960
Lights.

1256
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:33,100
- Camera.
- Toby.

1257
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:36,680
- Action.
- No.

1258
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,630
No, Toby.

1259
01:22:05,650 --> 01:22:08,980
Help me, please!
Please help!

1260
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:13,570
He's gonna kill me. This isn't a joke!

1261
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:17,030
- Help me! He's not kidding.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1262
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,870
- I was gonna kill the wench.
- Please, this is real!

1263
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:20,790
- But not, dear friends...
- This isn't a joke! Please!

1264
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,450
- without the approval...
- This isn't a joke!

1265
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:25,170
...and the approbation of you,
my audience.

1266
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:28,630
- My heart, my soul...
- No!

1267
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:32,840
my sustenance.

1268
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:37,220
So, so, shall we kill her?

1269
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:41,350
Or, or shall we spare
this maiden?

1270
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,680
- Toby, please stop!
- Show mercy

1271
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:47,350
- to the tender virgin?
- Please, Toby, no!

1272
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,110
No!

1273
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:52,900
- No? No?
- No! He's going to kill me!

1274
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:05,040
Yes! Yes!

1275
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,750
All right, then.

1276
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,250
Then the fatal stroke
