1
00:00:00,638 --> 00:00:02,490
I guess...

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,354
I do like you after all.

3
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:05,585
What did you do to her!?

4
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:07,259
You ditch her for a year

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,402
and then come back with a girlfriend
and even get yourself engaged.

6
00:00:09,402 --> 00:00:11,615
Don't come back now and
act like her fucking boyfriend!!

7
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:13,129
I love you after all that's happened.

8
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:14,811
What a selfish thing to say.

9
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:16,602
I can't think of any other woman but you.

10
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:18,384
I can understand why you're hesitating

11
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:21,730
but I don't think you should
keep things the way they are now.

12
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,864
Makino?

13
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:28,715
Who could it be?

14
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:40,621
Episode 6: Confession turns Chaotic!

15
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:59,346
Sorry for dragging you out here
but the walls were too thin in there.

16
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:02,848
What is it... that you want to tell me?

17
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:10,902
To you, has the young master
already became your past?

18
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,066
Huh?

19
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:15,239
Why are you asking me now?

20
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,783
Shortly after the young master
arrived at New York

21
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,989
there was one accident.

22
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:25,553
Triggered by one innocent phrase the
young master said at a certain party.

23
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:29,182
I never liked the way that ass--oh

24
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:32,020
I mean our president--does things.

25
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,176
He didn't mean much by it, as always,

26
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:38,840
but the media took it as words from the next
president and made a huge deal out of it.

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,714
People interpreted it as uncertainty in
the future, and our stocks plunged.

28
00:01:43,714 --> 00:01:47,291
I can't believe it...
Just by a word from Doumyouji?

29
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,339
The Doumyouji group suddenly faced a crisis

30
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:53,689
and the only solution was a mass lay off.

31
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,811
Among those laid off was a
Japanese man named Ken Uchida

32
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:59,746
whom the young master loved like a brother.

33
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:06,488
The lay off crushed his family
and he struggled to make a living.

34
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:11,628
One day, Ken Uchida came to see the president

35
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,313
and asked for employment. However

36
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:18,740
the president could not answer him

37
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,062
and losing all hope

38
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,728
he committed suicide in front of
the young master's own eyes.

39
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:37,870
That's when he began changing.

40
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:43,958
I think he started realizing that to stand at
the top means to be responsible for the millions

41
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:48,805
of lives and living that are
involved with the corporate group.

42
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:53,770
That's why he was so desperate to change:
to bury his feelings for you

43
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,531
and to stand at the top
of the corporate group.

44
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:05,448
It was during that time that he saw you again,
and shared his time with you again.

45
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:12,043
He must have no longer been able to
lie to himself about his true feelings.

46
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:24,979
But... aren't you completely against
Doumyouji and I dating?

47
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:28,334
I have to return to New York tomorrow as well.

48
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,992
However

49
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:34,850
Please don't lower your guard just
because the president herself is absent.

50
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,926
The next step has already...

51
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:39,346
Eh?

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,361
It's only when the young master is with you

53
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,971
that he acts human.

54
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:50,630
As someone who will eventually
stand at the top, I wish for him

55
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,451
to always be like so.

56
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,197
I hope you understand my meaning.

57
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:05,138
Ma-ki-no.

58
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,269
What's wrong?

59
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:10,343
You gave me a call.

60
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:14,615
That was

61
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:16,942
Nishida-san, wasn't he?

62
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,645
What's wrong?

63
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:25,651
Did something happen?

64
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:29,594
Not really.

65
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:34,938
Hey, let's go for a drive somewhere right now.

66
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:43,084
I guess not.

67
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,456
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,417
I'm just really confused now.

69
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:02,116
Will you be more confused?
Now that I do something like this to you?

70
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,938
Hey Sis! It's been a while.

71
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:13,386
No, I just... need your help.

72
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,740
I'm serious... Please...

73
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:28,750
And you just left after that?

74
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,132
Well...

75
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,764
I guess you can't help it.

76
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:36,547
Not after hearing about
Doumyouji-san's past like that.

77
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:40,923
Hey, what are you going to do
for this year's Valentine?

78
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,292
Eh?

79
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:47,850
Maybe this will be a good opportunity for you
to be honest about your feelings once again.

80
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,239
Yeah....

81
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:56,094
Maybe I should do something
on Valentine's day too.

82
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,659
By the way...

83
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:08,821
Yuuki, have Nishikado-san ever
let you ride on the back of his motorcycle once?

84
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:10,760
No. Why?

85
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,860
There's no mistake about it!

86
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,694
Mistress!

87
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:17,643
That seat is... reserved.

88
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:21,984
What do you mean, reserved?

89
00:06:21,984 --> 00:06:24,535
It means he's only going to let
one special woman sit there.

90
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:26,832
One special woman?

91
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,620
Now that you mention it...

92
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,609
I don't give girls rides.

93
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:38,636
I wonder if... Nishikado-san has someone
he can't forget or something.

94
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:43,755
Good question. I'm sure he must have
experienced his first love too.

95
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:46,284
First love, huh...

96
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:50,978
I wonder if he still cares about her...

97
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,709
You can't give up, Yuuki-chan!

98
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:59,420
What? You're going back now?

99
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,374
Because the midnight buses are the cheapest.

100
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:04,502
Call us as soon as anything comes up, okay?

101
00:07:05,581 --> 00:07:08,564
I can get some spending money
by the end of this month, right?

102
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,202
W-What? You can't?

103
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:15,380
Of course it's possible.

104
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,867
Exactly. Your father is currently famous
as the Man of the Sea right now!

105
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,448
See you later then!

106
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:27,742
Make sure you lock the doors
and turn off the gas!

107
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:32,599
Somehow, Mom and Dad seemed
suspicious, didn't they?

108
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,780
Yeah.

109
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:36,873
Oh, I need to lock the doors.

110
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:40,390
What?

111
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:41,877
Uh...

112
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:45,852
I... ran out of... sugar.

113
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:49,970
And I'm currently... looking for someone
who could share some sugar with me

114
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,688
in the neighborhood.

115
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,971
Huh? Isn't that a little...

116
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,135
What I mean is...

117
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:59,497
I was trying to make a commoner's food called...
jaga-niku or something.

118
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:01,486
You mean niku-jaga?

119
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,931
Hey! We were just about to have dinner!
Why don't you eat with us?

120
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:06,030
Eh?!

121
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,249
Please, come in.

122
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:11,140
Sis, please make jaga-niku.
I want to eat it too!

123
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,689
Like I said, it's niku-jaga.

124
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:14,707
Oh, that's right!

125
00:08:14,707 --> 00:08:16,832
- Can I borrow your room?
- Eh?

126
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:19,918
I want to study for as long as possible.

127
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,310
Wait, what are you talking about?
Aren't you already done with your exam?

128
00:08:24,445 --> 00:08:25,540
What are you doing?

129
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:27,690
O-Oh! That's right!!

130
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,573
What a coincidence. I'm going in!

131
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:30,573
Hey!

132
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:48,009
He must have no longer been able to lie
to himself about his true feelings.

133
00:08:57,144 --> 00:08:58,283
What are you...

134
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:04,437
I'm serious...

135
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,640
about what I said yesterday.

136
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:10,843
I want to say it again, properly.

137
00:09:11,704 --> 00:09:12,601
Stop!

138
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:18,416
Where... is your hand right now?

139
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:23,255
N-N-No, that's not it.

140
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:25,207
It was an accident--

141
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:28,605
Get your hand off me now!

142
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:49,710
Grandpa...! B-Bodies fell... into our room!

143
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,046
Sorry.

Hey, Rui

168
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:09,539
have you talked to Tsukasa since then?

169
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:10,653
Nah

170
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:13,594
Are you seriously serious about Makino?

171
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:16,755
Who knows?

172
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,979
It's not "who knows?"
What are you gonna do about it?

173
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:20,539
About what?

174
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:26,011
But if Tsukasa's feelings are
all going towards Makino

175
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,937
Is he going to break things off
clean with Oogahara Shigeru?

176
00:12:29,937 --> 00:12:33,723
At this rate, I don't think your friendship
with Tsukasa looks too good.

177
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:37,096
Who cares?
The worst that can happen is...

178
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:38,591
Rui...

179
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,337
Besides

180
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:44,835
the one who has to make the decision
is neither me nor Tsukasa, right?

181
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,625
It's something Makino needs to decide--

182
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,696
But what about Shizuka?

183
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:52,685
Huh? Didn't I tell you?

184
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:55,579
Thank you for everything.

185
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,478
Shizuka and I are over.

186
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,245
No way...

187
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,381
Yes, way.

188
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,772
Hey, hey, did you hear?
That peasant girl's apartment floor fell and

189
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:08,982
they're going to tear down the whole building!

190
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,332
No way! That's picture-perfect misery!

191
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:16,230
- But the news is bottomlessly pleasant.
- My, that was quite nice, Minako.

192
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,403
Wow wow
Are they serious?

193
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:24,055
You were with him, right? The one who
bought the entire apartment building from us?

194
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:26,154
Y-Yes...

195
00:13:26,154 --> 00:13:28,494
Do you know him?

196
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,093
Well, I guess, in a way.

197
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,419
I see.

198
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:38,378
Oh, here's your change.

199
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:43,907
Then, do you happen to know his friends too?

200
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,911
- You mean the F4?
- Yes, them.

201
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:51,012
Yes, I guess you can say... I know them.

202
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:54,053
I see.

203
00:13:58,703 --> 00:13:59,710
Onee-san!

204
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,584
Long time no see!

205
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:02,391
I'm not Yomogi, by the way!

206
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:03,710
Tsukushi-chan.

207
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,047
It smells so good!

208
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:14,584
All done.

209
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,047
I need to talk to you. Make some time.

210
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,237
Here is fine. Thank you.

211
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:42,708
Sis! You got here fast!

212
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,775
Tsukasa, I brought you a souvenir.

213
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:45,997
Thanks.

214
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:48,111
But before that, Sis,
about what we talked about the other day...

215
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:49,451
It's all right.

216
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:51,178
Eh? It's all right? But...

217
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:53,041
I said it's all right.

218
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,087
Makino!! H-Hi...

219
00:14:57,087 --> 00:14:59,223
What kind of dumb sound is that?

220
00:14:59,223 --> 00:15:01,293
You realize Tsukushi-chan just lost a place to live.

221
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:04,809
Oh! I was just... thinking about that too.

222
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:07,373
I have a good idea.

223
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,604
It's really all right. I can't possibly ask you to...

224
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:12,989
You can! You promised
you'll leave everything up to me, didn't you?

225
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:15,173
Hey, what happened? What's going on?

226
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:16,665
Can you believe this idiot

227
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,157
called me to ask me for my help on

228
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:21,982
how he can break his engagement
and start all over with Makino?

229
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:24,692
Hey! Don't say such
embarrassing things in front of her!

230
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,881
But it's important!

231
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:30,019
Tsukasa, there's no lie in
those words of yours, is there?

232
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,545
Yeah.

233
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:38,070
Then it's decided!

234
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:39,911
Come with me.

235
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:43,772
- Hey, wait. What's going--
- You stay here and clean that up.

236
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,284
I'll be waiting at the same cafe as last time.
--Shigeru

237
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:16,109
Don't make a face like that.
Come on in.

238
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,520
You can use this place
anyway you want from today.

239
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,603
Are you serious?

240
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:24,907
I think you'll be able to hide here
for a while if you're careful.

241
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,042
But...

242
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,481
You don't like... being close to Tsukasa?

243
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:35,441
T-That's...

244
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:46,144
If you still think it won't work out, it's okay.
That's a problem between the two of you.

245
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:51,281
But... I don't want any more people to suffer

246
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:55,368
because of what my mother has done.

247
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:56,657
Eh?

248
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,978
When I was in high school,

249
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,877
I used to date a boy from
an average working class family too.

250
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:06,529
YOU too?

251
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:19,958
But talks of marriage with the son of
a hotel chain owner suddenly came up because

252
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:24,180
my mother wanted to expand
her hotel business back then.

253
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,381
Just like Doumyouji now...

254
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:27,873
Yes.

255
00:17:28,827 --> 00:17:32,080
I rebelled a lot, too

256
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,734
but in the end, she said she'll cut all
business ties with his father's company

257
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:44,094
and that was it.
Furious wasn't even close to what I felt.

258
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:47,151
I honestly hated Mother then.

259
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:52,717
So that's why you've always been supporting me.

260
00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:00,173
But because he really takes good care of me now

261
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:05,575
I can honestly say I'm glad that
I got married from the bottom of my heart.

262
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:12,677
But... I also think about
what would have happened

263
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:16,378
if I had married the person
I really, really loved instead.

264
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:20,848
We could have eloped if we had wanted to

265
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:26,040
Or like Shizuka-chan, I could have
given up my family too, but...

266
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:33,117
In the end, I didn't have

267
00:18:33,117 --> 00:18:35,968
the courage to give up this life.

268
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:39,385
But it's weird,

269
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:45,039
because even now, part of me is still
blaming my old self for it.

270
00:18:45,677 --> 00:18:49,236
Like why didn't I try harder?

271
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,121
That's why I don't want Tsukasa to
go through the same thing.

272
00:18:57,121 --> 00:19:00,256
Especially if it's with you, Tsukushi-chan.

273
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,007
Onee-san...

274
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,187
Please consider living here.

275
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,013
It'll also be a good opportunity for you to
settle things with Tsukasa once and for all.

276
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:16,486
Right?

277
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:36,884
Sorry for making you make some time for me.

278
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,907
What are you talking about?
I'm really happy you asked me out.

279
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:44,855
So

280
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,901
Do you want to drink something?
Here's the menu.

281
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:48,875
Oh thanks.

282
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,498
Look, look, look. Look at this!

283
00:19:51,915 --> 00:19:53,438
Tada!

284
00:19:54,324 --> 00:19:56,983
It's about our wedding,
but where should we hold it?

285
00:19:56,983 --> 00:20:03,245
I want one overseas with just the two of us,
But you know how our parents are

286
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,229
always talking about networking?
They probably want a formal wedding and stuff.

287
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:10,778
Oh, I'm having them make the
wedding dress now. And it's so awesome!

288
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:13,570
If you see me in that,
I bet you'll fall in love with me again.

289
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,805
- Um...
- Oh, did you decide what you wanted?

290
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:19,201
- Excuse me!!
- Actually, I could care less about the drink...

291
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:22,003
I'm not going to break up with you.

292
00:20:22,707 --> 00:20:28,061
If you break up with me, I might just die.

293
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:37,054
- You serious??
- I am.

294
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:40,078
- What a chain of events.
- I know.

295
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:42,773
- What about Susumu-kun?
- That's just it.

296
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,769
Don't worry about me!
I'll go live with Mom and Dad.

297
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:47,846
But what about school?

298
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,792
I've already got into high school,
and it's almost the end of the year. It'll be okay.

299
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,665
But it's not okay.

300
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:57,621
Besides, it's better if I'm not here, isn't it?

301
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:04,970
- So he went to your parents' place?
- Yuuki-chan.

302
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,750
My lessons are starting. I'll call you later.

303
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:14,034
- Did Tsukushi-chan find a place to live?
- Yes.

304
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:15,613
Thank goodness!

305
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:17,197
But looks like she has a lot of troubles already.

306
00:21:18,002 --> 00:21:19,484
Yeah...

307
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:22,325
It seems like everything's
riding on Valentine's Day.

308
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:25,182
- Valentine's Day?
- Yes.

309
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,710
Valentine's, huh...

310
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:32,085
I don't have a very good memory of that.

311
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,310
Oh, really?

312
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:37,067
Yeah, really.

313
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,888
The word Valentine is taboo in front of Soujirou.

314
00:21:40,888 --> 00:21:43,842
It's not really taboo or anything, it's just...

315
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:46,902
- Then I'll give you chocolate if you give me a ride!
- Hey, wanna join me?

316
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:49,281
I really can't do that.

317
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:11,587
Can I really stay here?

318
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:21,453
- Welcome home.
- Oh, hey, Sis.

319
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:25,193
Tsukushi-chan is going to start living here with us.

320
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:26,312
I see--

321
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,447
What??!!

322
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:30,379
The rest is up to you. Good luck.

323
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,561
Then I'll excuse myself now.

324
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:34,777
You're leaving all ready?

325
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:38,504
But moreover, is Makino really going to live here?

326
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:41,395
You shouldn't attack her while she's asleep.

327
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:42,717
I won't!

328
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:46,053
I mean, thanks, Sis!

329
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:48,561
You're awesome! You're the best!

330
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:53,620
Before you get so excited, you need to
settle things with Oogahara Shigeru-san first.

331
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:03,046
Breaking your engagement with
her and choosing Tsukushi-chan is

332
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:08,743
something that'll require a sacrifice from
both your part and the corporate group's part.

333
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:13,825
I know.

334
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:19,587
What you are about to do is

335
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:22,217
to love someone at the
stake of your life, you know.

336
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,631
Whatever you do,
make sure you do them carefully.

337
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:29,922
Don't do anything rash.

338
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:31,173
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

339
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:33,945
Would you like to buy some Valentine chocolate?

340
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:39,434
- Thank you very much.
- Welcome.

341
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,630
Would you like to buy some Valentine chocolate?

342
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:09,549
You and I are both Saturn according to astrology,

343
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:15,292
so regardless of happy or painful times,
we're destined to be together.

344
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,430
I couldn't fall asleep at all

345
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,418
-  and I couldn't even make lunch this morning.
- Makino!

346
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:33,512
- Eat over here.
- We'll treat you.

347
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:37,738
- Thank you so much.
- Don't worry about it.

348
00:26:37,738 --> 00:26:40,295
So where are you going to stay now?

349
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:44,978
I-I'm staying with someone I know...

350
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:49,824
O-Oh!! Did you know Yuuki's taking
Japanese tea lessons, Nishikado-san?

351
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:53,175
Really? Which school?

352
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:55,434
I'm... not sure...

353
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:56,961
She's got some courage.

354
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:58,962
You should go see her one of these days.

355
00:26:58,962 --> 00:27:01,310
- Are there any cute girls?
- Of course!

356
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,406
Oh! Yuuki's new friend is really cute!

357
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,791
All right! Let's go take a peek next time!

358
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:09,873
- If we have time.
- Of course we do.

359
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:10,994
Hey, Tsukasa.

360
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:17,461
W-W-Wooooah Makino-kun! It's been a while!

361
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:20,984
Hey, hey, hey, you guys are so easy to figure out.
Something happened, didn't it?

362
00:27:20,984 --> 00:27:22,519
Nothing, right, Makino-kun?

363
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,238
Not like we have any secrets.

364
00:27:24,238 --> 00:27:25,324
Hey!

365
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:28,512
So what about this secret?
Something did happen, didn't it?!

366
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:30,946
You're up to something bad again!

367
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:34,403
W-Why are you two ganging up on me?
T-Treating me like I'm a criminal or something.

368
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,650
- I'll call my lawyer.
- Lawyer??

369
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:43,926
I completely forgot!

370
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:45,396
The results are coming out today!

371
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:49,875
Hey, Tsukasa, you can't keep any secrets from us.

372
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,438
The more people know about Makino and I

373
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,507
the bigger the ripple gets for sure.

374
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:57,893
What do you mean?

375
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,776
Makino is staying at my house right now.

376
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:03,037
Huh??

377
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:05,472
Does your mom know?

378
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:06,688
No.

379
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:11,592
That's why I'm planning
to approach this with caution.

380
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:15,706
After all, it's love that I'm
staking my life on.

381
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,559
Your result is inside.

382
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:31,267
Rui

383
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:33,363
let's talk with just the two of us.

384
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,021
Hey, hey, let's do this peacefully.

385
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:39,256
Let's go, Akira. These two have
got to work things out themselves.

386
00:28:40,248 --> 00:28:41,645
Thanks.

387
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:43,034
Please, God...

388
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,592
Passed

389
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:56,726
Thaaaank yooooou!!!

390
00:28:56,726 --> 00:29:00,630
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!

391
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:02,882
Hanazawa Rui

392
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:06,037
Hello? Hanazawa Rui?

393
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,850
I got into law major!

394
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,179
Congratulations.
We should go celebrate.

395
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:14,395
Don't worry about it!
You've done more than enough for me already.

396
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:16,768
Hey, Rui, who are you talking to on the phone?

397
00:29:16,768 --> 00:29:18,989
Makino. She got into law--

398
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:22,415
Hey, wait, is Doumyouji there?

399
00:29:22,784 --> 00:29:25,155
He is.

400
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:25,923
Do you want to talk to him?

401
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:28,857
N-No! I'll call you again later.

402
00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:33,771
Ack, she hung up.

403
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:37,043
I see you're definitely picking a fight with me.

404
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:41,549
Why did you call me if you're with him?

405
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:52,982
Shigeru-san?

406
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:57,729
Makino has been staying
at my place since yesterday.

407
00:29:58,507 --> 00:29:59,991
I see.

408
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:04,461
Aren't you surprised?

409
00:30:04,461 --> 00:30:06,186
I am.

410
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:10,296
Aren't you jealous?

411
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,010
I am.

412
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:16,709
What?

413
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:18,938
Is that strange?

414
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:26,647
I...

415
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:30,282
guess you can say I woke up by your words.

416
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:37,210
I tried to forget about Makino because of what
happened at New York but it's like impossible...

417
00:30:37,911 --> 00:30:42,637
She's still... the best in my heart.

418
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:49,690
There should be a way I can be with her

419
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,140
and not cause trouble for anyone else.

420
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,436
And even if the marriage talk falls apart,

421
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:58,979
there are many ways to rebuild the company.

422
00:31:00,216 --> 00:31:02,956
When I realized that

423
00:31:02,956 --> 00:31:05,706
no one can stop my feelings anymore.

424
00:31:06,918 --> 00:31:10,494
Are you telling me to give up on Makino?

425
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:16,308
To put things simply, yes.

426
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,027
Valentine.

427
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,629
Eh?

428
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,228
I wonder who Makino will give her chocolates to.

429
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:34,357
Hanazawa Rui-san, isn't it?

430
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:40,987
Don't tell me it's Tsukasa...

431
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,896
I see!

432
00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:51,014
Um... Shigeru-san...

433
00:31:51,014 --> 00:31:53,213
You said "congratulations" to me, didn't you?

434
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:59,416
The night Tsukasa asked me to be his girlfriend,

435
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:03,107
You said "good for you" to me, didn't you?

436
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:10,040
Tsukushi, you said there's nothing
between you and Tsukasa, didn't you?

437
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:15,955
I can believe your words, can't I?

438
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:23,397
I can believe you, can't I?

439
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,258
Hello?

440
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:48,170
- Sorry I didn't come to work today.
- It's okay, don't worry.

441
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,281
What's up?

442
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:52,785
I'm having Sara-san teach me
how to make chocolate.

443
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:59,780
So, have you decided yet?

444
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,563
Who you're going to give your chocolate to.

445
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,629
You've held yourself back for so long.

446
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:07,949
You don't have to do that anymore, okay?

447
00:33:09,132 --> 00:33:10,859
Yeah.

448
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:14,422
Thanks.

449
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:16,855
See ya.

450
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,149
So Tsukushi-chan is still mulling over
a lot of things, huh.

451
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:25,956
Looks like it.

452
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:29,214
Isn't this it? It says Japanese Room.

453
00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:35,210
But really, this place is too small to make tea.

454
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:43,973
Hey, Sara-san, where are you going?

455
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:45,558
There she is.

456
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:49,021
Yuuki-chan, we've come to see you.

457
00:33:49,557 --> 00:33:51,776
I've humbly come to serve my tea.

458
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,503
Hello, my name is Mimasaka. Nice to meet you.

459
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:01,231
Thank you very much.

460
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:09,534
Eh? Nishikado-san?

461
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:12,634
Um, that's Sara-san's cup,
so please use this one instead.

462
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,942
Sara? You mean Hinata Sara?

463
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:19,626
Yes...
Do you... know her?

464
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:24,014
No... not really.

465
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:26,106
Nishikado-san?

466
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:28,613
Hey, what's wrong? Where are you going?

467
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:30,790
Hey! You're leaving?

468
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,943
- If you are, what are we going to--
- Why don't you stay, Mimasaka-san?

469
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:45,428
Tsukushi

470
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:48,756
you said there's nothing
between you and Tsukasa, didn't you?

471
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:52,297
I can believe your words, can't I?

472
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,099
[ Valentine's Day ]
Please be careful! Stand back!

473
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:20,738
Young master is currently out!

474
00:35:21,675 --> 00:35:23,275
They knew each other?

475
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:26,315
Probably, because Sara-san
didn't come back after that either.

476
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:31,325
Maybe she was Nishikado-san's first love...

477
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:49,247
What about you?
What are you going to do?

478
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,824
I...

479
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:58,973
Tomorrow, I'm seeing Makino.

480
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:02,378
Rui

481
00:36:03,397 --> 00:36:05,265
did she call you?

482
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,773
Nope.

483
00:36:10,904 --> 00:36:12,890
I won't hesitate to do what I need to do.

484
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:39,853
Namura-kun, here you go.

485
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,720
Oh. Thanks.

486
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:45,493
Let's go.

487
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:02,227
Sorry. Were you waiting for a long time?

488
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:05,238
No, I just got here.

489
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:11,005
You have something you want to give me, right?

490
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:17,697
I'm... really not sure...

491
00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:19,467
Don't worry.

492
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:21,461
Just hurry up and hand it over.

493
00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:31,834
This.

494
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:34,534
Hm?

495
00:37:48,472 --> 00:37:50,087
What do you mean?

496
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:57,865
I'm giving it back to you.
I want to put a firm end to this.

497
00:37:59,765 --> 00:38:01,155
That's what it means.

498
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:06,435
This has to be a joke...

499
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:11,741
I've thought a long time about
a lot of things and this is my answer.

500
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:20,867
You were too late...

501
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,723
After hurting so many people

502
00:38:24,723 --> 00:38:27,902
we can't just stay together and
be happy by ourselves.

503
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:54,509
Cut the fuck out!

504
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:06,075
Is that all I am to you?!

505
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:07,196
Eh?

506
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:12,047
If you say you don't want a thing like that,
it means NOTHING to me!

507
00:39:13,732 --> 00:39:16,790
I won't be sad or anything!

508
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,470
I...

509
00:39:22,212 --> 00:39:24,046
I...

510
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:26,740
can't think of anyone...

511
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:31,482
I can¡¯t think of any other woman but you!!

512
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:04,398
This is my first gift to a woman

513
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:06,657
so I'm going to kill you if you lose it.

514
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:14,862
You're in love with me, aren't you?

515
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:16,779
I am.

516
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:21,145
I'm in love with your
stupid, selfish, stubborn self--

517
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:43,570
To Tsukasa whom I love very much

518
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,348
Let's be together forever
--Shigeru

519
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,276
Excuse me.

520
00:43:06,276 --> 00:43:07,300
Oh.

521
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,844
Have you not slept?

522
00:43:09,844 --> 00:43:11,324
It's none of your business!

523
00:43:11,324 --> 00:43:13,052
Pardon me.

524
00:43:13,603 --> 00:43:16,273
How will you have your breakfast?

525
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:19,375
Let's see... Bring it...

526
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:25,088
What are you doing?

527
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:28,412
Don't stare at me so much.

528
00:43:28,412 --> 00:43:30,490
Why are you pro-wrestling
so early in the morning?

529
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,108
Pro-wresting..?

530
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:35,549
You mean cosplaying? ..Sir?

531
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:37,007
So what are you doing?

532
00:43:38,862 --> 00:43:42,267
Please let me work here from today.

533
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:43,622
Huh?

534
00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:50,566
It's true that I don't have a place to go and I'm
really thankful you're letting me stay here

535
00:43:50,566 --> 00:43:56,192
But I can't just freeload... I must not... so...

536
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,172
Are you serious?

537
00:43:59,635 --> 00:44:01,783
I want a reason!

538
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:10,885
to be able to live here... with you.

539
00:44:10,885 --> 00:44:12,358
Makino...

540
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,659
That's why...

541
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:25,688
this is my best attempt to give you... a reply...

542
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:27,718
Sir.

543
00:44:29,316 --> 00:44:32,580
But... as a servant?

544
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,009
I don't see any problems with that.

545
00:44:36,283 --> 00:44:37,562
Tama!!

546
00:44:37,562 --> 00:44:42,327
We just happened to be short on staff anyways.
Let's have her work for us.

547
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:45,129
...Who is she?

548
00:44:45,129 --> 00:44:48,669
Tama... when did you come back?

549
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:55,205
Late last night. I've been asked
to look after you by Kaede-sama.

550
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:56,107
Eh?

551
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:59,750
No need to worry.

552
00:45:01,487 --> 00:45:09,005
I am not so cruel as to refuse people with needs.

553
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:13,276
Now, please follow me.

554
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,829
Ow ow ow ow!

555
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:22,819
It hurts! Granny, can you
please go a little slower--

556
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:28,395
Don't call me as lightly as granny!!

557
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:35,021
I have been the head servant of this house
for sixty years, since the previous generation.

558
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:39,233
I will not stand having you
call me on such friendly terms!

559
00:45:39,233 --> 00:45:41,055
I'm sorry.

560
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:44,078
Call me senior.

561
00:45:45,303 --> 00:45:49,766
Now that you said you'll work,
I'll have you work frantically.

562
00:45:53,068 --> 00:45:58,854
There are plenty of things to do around here.

563
00:45:58,854 --> 00:46:01,238
I won't show any mercy.

564
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:06,121
Everything I say here is the order.

565
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:09,498
Do not forget that.

566
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:21,864
I'm going to stake my life on you.

567
00:46:21,864 --> 00:46:24,288
Does that mean I still have a chance?

568
00:46:24,288 --> 00:46:25,781
That's the most important thing is.

569
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:28,379
You've got to be kidding me.

570
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:31,360
Don't you both overwork yourself.

571
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:32,404
Do your best.

572
00:46:32,404 --> 00:46:34,228
Next is your turn.

573
00:46:34,229 --> 00:46:36,367
You're going to let me stay here tonight.

574
00:46:36,368 --> 00:46:37,368
You can't get in touch with Yuuki?

575
00:46:37,723 --> 00:46:40,991
She seemed to have
disappeared since Valentine's Day.

576
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:44,066
In that case, it makes somewhat of a sense,
doesn't it? That both of them are missing?

577
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,067
Yuuki?? Hey, Yuuki??

578
00:46:46,711 --> 596:31:23,640
I'm going to tell him flat out,
"You're not the one for me."
