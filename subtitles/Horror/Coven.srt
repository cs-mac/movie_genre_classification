1
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:13,539
Fuck, why didn't we get
a motel room before, huh?

2
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:16,187
This is fucking great.

3
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:18,021
Danielle was a lucky girl.

4
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:21,966
If I had you, I'd never
let you leave the bedroom.

5
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:23,474
What are you talking about?

6
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:24,725
You are Danielle.

7
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:27,808
Sorry stud, I'm Sharon.

8
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:29,839
You're a great fuck, Nick.

9
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,172
But I don't like loose ends.

10
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:13,902
Cut!

11
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:16,152
Oh, my God, he's drenched.

12
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,619
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is a wrap

13
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:22,671
on Crystal Force 15 Blood Angel.

14
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:27,317
Oh, my God, I'm never working

15
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:28,922
in ultra low budget again.

16
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:30,347
It's gonna take a Silkwood shower

17
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:32,964
to get all of this blood off of us.

18
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:33,968
Good job, Shelley.

19
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,516
Thanks.

20
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:36,749
Can you go get our celebratory

21
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:40,222
items from the craft services table?

22
00:02:40,222 --> 00:02:41,830
Ooo, champagne.

23
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,950
Can you afford that on this budget?

24
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,674
I mean, seriously.

25
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:46,893
I'll do as many of these as you want.

26
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:49,755
I mean, I survived, so I get to be

27
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:53,005
in Crystal Force 16, right?

28
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:53,998
Well.

29
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:03,123
Dude, get up.

30
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:05,974
He said cut.

31
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:08,862
You said you needed
a ride to acting class.

32
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:10,026
And I have to go to my acting class.

33
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,709
So come on, get up, let's go.

34
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:12,876
What the fuck!

35
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:16,168
The answer to your question, Shelley.

36
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,098
I don't think you're gonna
make it to the sequel.

37
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,887
Holy shit, is he dead!

38
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,999
Yes, Shelley, he's dead.

39
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,924
God, she's so intuitive.

40
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:27,026
Which is what makes you
such a great actress.

41
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:29,021
That was sarcasm by the way.

42
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:30,919
What is going on?

43
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,227
What do you have the cheese knife

44
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:34,021
from the craft services table?

45
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,716
Get off of me, you fucking rapist.

46
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,359
What is going on here?

47
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,772
Do you know why Crystal Force

48
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:44,210
is such a successful horror franchise?

49
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,707
One of the most successful in history?

50
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:48,809
Strong scripts?

51
00:03:48,809 --> 00:03:50,339
Hardly.

52
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:51,542
Good direction?

53
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:54,357
I'm flattered, but no.

54
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:57,656
High value on such a low budget.

55
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:59,465
Now, you just fucking with me.

56
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:01,423
No, Shelley, the reason Crystal Force

57
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:03,187
is such a successful franchise is

58
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:06,672
because we practice what we preach.

59
00:04:06,672 --> 00:04:08,483
So at the end of every film, which is

60
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:11,168
my favorite cast party,

61
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,109
we cut out your fucking heart.

62
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:14,132
And deliver it to the Master,

63
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:16,649
who is also our executive producer.

64
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,232
He casts a spell on it and bam!

65
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:22,471
Direct to video gold.

66
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,272
You can't kill me.

67
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,449
My agent got me this gig.

68
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:27,991
She knows where I am.

69
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:29,994
And if I don't answer her
texts about auditions,

70
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:33,422
she's gonna know this is
the last job I ever worked.

71
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:35,648
God, she talks a lot.

72
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:39,572
Your agent, my dear,
is part of the coven.

73
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:43,292
And you didn't quite book
enough gigs this year.

74
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,039
Please, I'll join your coven.

75
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,206
I'll do anything you want.

76
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,466
That's a wrap.

77
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:37,023
So, should we have a friendly wager

78
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,167
on whether or not I'm gonna have

79
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,712
to save your ass from these witches

80
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,054
covens in the third film?

81
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:43,249
Actually, I'm kind of hoping

82
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,386
I get to be an evil witch this time.

83
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:49,219
So hopefully you'll be
saving someone else's ass from me.

84
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:50,523
I think I saved your ass from

85
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,881
a witches coven, twice,
Detective Gilmore,

86
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:56,964
aka worst detective ever.

87
00:09:57,108 --> 00:10:00,901
I think I saved
both your assess in two movies.

88
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,932
So, simmer down Greg Andrews,
aka worst

89
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:06,208
warlock witch hunter ever.

90
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:12,130
I totally hope
I get killed again in this one.

91
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,307
Me too.

92
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:14,541
<i>♫ Killed again dance ♫</i>

93
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:17,477
<i>♫ And doing the killed again dance ♫</i>

94
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:20,701
I'd actually like to
live through one for once.

95
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:22,388
It's okay.

96
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,533
Hey, where's Shelley?

97
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,581
You guys remember her?

98
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,941
Didn't she play Danielle in Blood Angel?

99
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:28,805
Yeah, isn't she in this one two?

100
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:30,227
We sort of bonded on Blood Angel

101
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:34,113
but then I never saw her again,
very strange.

102
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,859
I've literally kept up with three people

103
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:38,933
I've met on set, over the past 10 years.

104
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,438
We just go our own ways.

105
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:42,271
Yeah, I know.

106
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:43,470
But I ran into almost all you guys

107
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,154
at auditions this last year.

108
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:46,397
She just sort of vanished.

109
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,184
Won't even answer her texts.

110
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:49,798
Maybe she just went home.

111
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:51,817
Plenty of people just give up and bail.

112
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,533
Maybe, it's just weird.

113
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,344
I'll tell you what's weird.

114
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:57,112
Check out the IMDB listings for almost

115
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:59,512
any actor in any Crystal Force movie.

116
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:02,427
And see how many listings
they have after that.

117
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:03,302
Like, a lot?

118
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:04,806
Like zero.

119
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:07,574
It's the Crystal Force curse.

120
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:10,874
You do one Crystal Force movie
and you're done.

121
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:12,837
Greta, what are you talking about?

122
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:15,734
We've all done more than one
Crystal Force film.

123
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:17,606
We did two, back to back, last summer.

124
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:19,923
And we're about to do a table read for 16.

125
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:22,469
I'm just saying,
from Crystal Force to Crystal Force 13,

126
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:25,101
almost all those actors have disappeared.

127
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,447
You stick around long enough,
you hear stories.

128
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,745
Then why are you here?

129
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,331
I didn't know about the curse

130
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:33,344
until after I started shooting 14.

131
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:34,480
When they asked me to do this one,

132
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,605
I thought, "Keep your friends close

133
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,613
"and your enemies closer."

134
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,858
I wonder what happened
to all those other actors?

135
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:42,571
Yeah, what do you think happened?
Do you think they actually

136
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:43,695
got killed in those films?

137
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:44,915
That's insane.

138
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:46,882
You're insane.

139
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:48,619
I'm just saying.

140
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:49,819
Everyone, settle down.

141
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:52,144
Your director extraordinaire,
Jamal is here.

142
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:52,986
Come on in, Jamal.

143
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:55,970
Give him a round of applause.
Come on in, Jamal.

144
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,433
Hey, Jamal.

145
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,349
I took care of it.

146
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:02,299
Hey, everybody.

147
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,509
Hey!

148
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:04,510
Sorry about that.

149
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,622
Welcome back to Crystal Force.

150
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:12,739
All right, so... congrats.

151
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,172
Crystal Force 14 and 15
did so well on VLD

152
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:18,015
and auxiliary revenue streams,

153
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:21,054
that the executive producer
wants to reboot the series.

154
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:22,856
- All right!
- All right!

155
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:25,288
And he wants to use, all of you.

156
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,312
- Yeah.
- High five.

157
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:28,356
High five.

158
00:12:30,178 --> 00:12:31,725
So, what we have, I believe,

159
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:33,568
did you send out
the shooting scrips, obviously?

160
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:34,937
Anyone missing any?

161
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:35,770
Could I?

162
00:12:37,186 --> 00:12:40,624
All right, so, what you have there

163
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:43,457
is Crystal Force 16 Freshman Year.

164
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,205
How about we just give it a read

165
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:47,763
and then we can talk about all

166
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:49,667
the pertinent production details.

167
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:51,542
Sorry, guys.

168
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:58,245
I love, I love, I love how,
I have your undivided attention.

169
00:12:58,352 --> 00:12:59,676
Damn it, I'm so sorry,

170
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:01,005
it's a call back for a regular series.

171
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:02,403
It's a gig.

172
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:03,818
I wouldn't even ask but the producers

173
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:04,956
want to see me right now.

174
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,198
And it's really important.

175
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:08,820
Okay, all right, sure.

176
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,354
Just keep an eye on your email
for the shooting schedule.

177
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,220
- Okay, thanks Jamal.
- Hmm.

178
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,432
You guys have a good read.

179
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:15,471
I'll see you on the set.

180
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:17,054
- Good luck.
- Bye.

181
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:18,951
Anybody else?

182
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:21,393
Phone calls, emails.

183
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:23,946
- All right, shut your phone off please.
- Yeah.

184
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:28,479
All right, okay,

185
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:32,400
let's turn to page one.

186
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,507
Let's start at the top.

187
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:36,296
I'll read all the stage directions.

188
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,571
Crystal Force, origins by yours truly.

189
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:42,243
Producer, director, now screenwriter?

190
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:45,183
Is there anything this man can't do?

191
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:46,940
Bring a movie in under budget.

192
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:50,338
You know what?

193
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:52,147
Just for that,
I'm gonna kill your character

194
00:13:52,147 --> 00:13:54,042
off first in the re-write.

195
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,715
All right, all right, back to business.

196
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:01,663
"Fade in, interior, suburban home.

197
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,263
"Day, Greg Andrews is putting

198
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,935
"the finishing touches on killing a witch,

199
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:09,935
"in a huge house,
in Orange County, California."

200
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:25,801
You want naughty nurse?

201
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:28,008
I'll give you naughty nurse.

202
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:33,925
Doctor, superhero, waitress, nurse.

203
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,431
Nice try, Pazuza.

204
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,230
If you're the most powerful
witch in the coven,

205
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,579
you're gonna have a lot of trouble

206
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,412
keeping the door open, guaranteed.

207
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,399
"Burn their bones.

208
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,524
"Then scatter the ashes
from here to Orange County.

209
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,447
"The remains of the coven
must be separated

210
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:31,566
"to prevent
the resurrection of the Master.

211
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:34,063
"But now that even the Master is gone,

212
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:36,735
"his apocalypse are legion.

213
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,811
"With your newfound powers
comes responsibility.

214
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:41,611
"You must ever be vigilant, because

215
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,701

216
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,957
"against the dark arts.

217
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:47,755
"Best of luck."

218
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:49,019
"Greg Andrews turns and walks

219
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,453

00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:54,010
"standing over the bodies of the coven.

221
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,843
- "As we fade to black."
- Yeah.

222
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,051
Okay, since Origins kind of folds

223
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:05,197
back on itself, um, you have the...

224
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,039
Yeah, the DVDs.

225
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,047
Thank you.

226
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:07,748
I thought it would be great

227
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:09,621
to reference some of the older
Crystal Force movies.

228
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:11,030
So you guys should maybe team together

229
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,613
and check them out.

230
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:15,753
Let me introduce you to, DVDs.

231
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:18,239
Guys and sel-a-mon.

232
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,072
Got it.

233
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,996
Ooo, Crystal Force 10
Headmistress of Magic, spooky.

234
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:26,668
I'm actually in that one.

235
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:27,845
Shut up.

236
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:31,617
And this one,
Crystal Force School The New Class.

237
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:33,437
Unfairly overlooked for

238
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:35,604
an Oscar nomination, if you ask me.

239
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:39,962
All right, keep an eye on your emails

240
00:16:39,962 --> 00:16:43,530
for rehearsal schedule and call sheets.

241
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,940
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

242
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,485
You're welcome.

243
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:47,318
Don't die.

244
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,242
Don't die.

245
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,605
- All right.
- You gonna need any specialty items

246
00:16:57,605 --> 00:17:00,380
for the craft service, or anything?

247
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,665
Yeah, we'll take care of it later.

248
00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:02,758
All right.

249
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:04,390
Think they're gonna watch
the movies or not?

250
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,426
A lot of times you give them things

251
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:07,686
they just say they're gonna watch them.

252
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:09,328
I'll know when they watch them or not.

253
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,298
They better watch them.

254
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:11,219
I gotta take care of something.

255
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:12,052
They don't know who you are,

256
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:14,925
you're extraordinaire Jamal.

257
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:25,953
Wow, looks like Henry gets a reprieval.

258
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:30,205
Despite the fact that we killed
his ass in Crystal Force.

259
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:34,629
I can take it.

260
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:39,780
Do it!

261
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,613
Ahhhhhh!

262
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:49,728
Do it, Rose!

263
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:50,561
Ahhhhh!

264
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:11,070
Well, the fans demanded my return, so.

265
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,073
Yeah, well, you wanna come over
and watch them then?

266
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:19,105
Seeing as how we're gonna be
playing Henry and Linda again.

267
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:21,688
Flashback to Linda and Henry.

268
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:28,676
Yeah, whatever,
flashback to Henry and Linda.

269
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,682
So you wanna come over and watch?

270
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:36,099
Sure but, my soap opera on camera class

271
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:40,406
let's out at 7:00,
so how about eightish?

272
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:41,622
All right, that'll work.

273
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,226
I have a cold read for commercial class

274
00:18:43,226 --> 00:18:44,437
that gets out at 6:30.

275
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:47,529
I can just swing by the store
and get something to eat.

276
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,362
- Awesome.
- All right.

277
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,083
Hey, come on in.

278
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:22,589
Thanks for having me over.

279
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:24,488
I brought this.

280
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:26,655
Hmm, fancy.

281
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:30,629
I happen to know that
this bottle of wine

282
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,962
costs about $10.

283
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,898
Well, only the best.

284
00:19:41,903 --> 00:19:46,713
Speaking of fancy,
how can you afford this place?

285
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:47,796
Two things.

286
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,730
My grandma left it to me,
right after she passed.

287
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,595
And it was pretty much all paid off then.

288
00:19:55,595 --> 00:20:00,063
Second, you remember that
Little Christy's commercial?

289
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:03,280
The one with the little girl
and the kitten?

290
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,724
It aired like,
a billion times a day in the 80s.

291
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:09,022
And then that same little girl

292
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:11,819
was on all the packaging?

293
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,702
- That was you?
- Yep.

294
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:17,595
I ended up putting it all
in a trust fund.

295
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:20,178
And paying it off when I turned 18.

296
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:28,202
I made fucking bank off that shit.

297
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,538
Well, here's to child labor.

298
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:39,009
Child labor and... shitty $10 wine.

299
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,148
I have cheap tastes.

300
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:46,315
Hmmm, speaking of,
are you ready for the main event?

301
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:02,028
Crystal Force 315 million.

302
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:03,784
I have high hopes.

303
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:30,993
This is actually not half bad.

304
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,635
I wonder what happened
to these... actors?

305
00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:38,635
Hmm, who knows?

306
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:41,384
You can make a pretty decent living

307
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,969
off of commercials and
random guest spots on TV

308
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:47,802
and still remain pretty invisible.

309
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,423
Where are they?

310
00:21:57,423 --> 00:21:58,673
Where are we?

311
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:03,180
I don't see them anymore.

312
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,713
Come on, Rose.

313
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:09,957
Carter?

314
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,232
Carter.

315
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:23,554
- Honey.
- Don't resist me, you know you want it.

316
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,740
I can't, can't do this.

317
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,657
Stan, Kelly, anybody?

318
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:50,071
Oh, what's happening to me!

319
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:02,360
Greetings Will Spanner.

320
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,873
It's you, you're the demon Abadon.

321
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:08,040
I don't fear you, go away.

322
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:13,445
Master promises to spare, all the others

323
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:15,334
if you return your allegiance to him,

324
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:16,751
where it belongs.

325
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,142
You go back to hell and you tell him,

326
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:22,131
he will never have me voluntarily.

327
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:25,281
Oh, God, no!

328
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:09,235
How come the guys never get naked?

329
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:12,318
No, I don't know,
they have better agents.

330
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,049
You see that?

331
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,436
See what?

332
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:23,629
- Hey.
- Master Abadon.

333
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:25,218
Hey what?

334
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:29,990
It's pretty hot, don't you think?

335
00:25:33,092 --> 00:25:34,308
Well, yeah, if you like watching

336
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:38,093
naked people have sex is incredibly hot.

337
00:25:38,093 --> 00:25:40,760
That's the funny thing though.

338
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:44,831
I love watching naked people have sex.

339
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:48,524
Whoa, what are you doing?

340
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:50,166
Research.

341
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,519
For what?

342
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,832
For our sex scene in the film.

343
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:56,423
We don't have a sex scene in the film.

344
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:58,923
But we should, shouldn't we?

345
00:25:59,796 --> 00:26:02,134
Okay, okay, wait, hold on.

346
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:04,442
I'm totally into this.

347
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,838
And I mean totally into what I think

348
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:08,877
is about to happen here, but I wanna

349
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:10,371
be sure for both of our sake that

350
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:13,424
you're not just drunk off
of this shitty wine.

351
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:15,902
Or secretly on drugs, or something

352
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:16,983
that make you out of your mind

353
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:18,294
to want to have sex with me.

354
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:20,377
You wanna do this, right?

355
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:22,451
What's the matter, baby?

356
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,209
You never pulled a we-and before?

357
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:18,425
Oh, my God!

358
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:19,779
Oh, my God!

359
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,529
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

360
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,800
Sharon.

361
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:27,946
Jamal?

362
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:31,315
Jamal? What are you doing here?

363
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:33,148
Oh, oh, God.

364
00:28:34,189 --> 00:28:35,022
Here.

365
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:44,286
Sharon, Sharon.

366
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:46,893
Sharon, look at me.

367
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,843
Sharon, do you remember what happened?

368
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:57,760
Yes, Samuel and I, we were,

369
00:28:58,032 --> 00:29:01,032
we were watching the movie and then,

370
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:05,719
and then something
started happening to the screen.

371
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:09,288
And then Samuel couldn't see the screen.

372
00:29:11,555 --> 00:29:14,208
And then something
started to take over me.

373
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,791
I don't know how to explain it.

374
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:21,271
And then I wanted to kill Samuel.

375
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:24,864
And then I was happy
that it was happening.

376
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:28,864
And then, Samuel's dead.

377
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:33,495
Is this terrible?

378
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,059
No, no, it's not.

379
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,267
Sharon, what I'm about to tell you

380
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:46,288
is gonna sound absolutely insane.

381
00:29:46,288 --> 00:29:48,288
But it's 100% true.

382
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,940
The Crystal Force movie are hexed.

383
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,773
I know, because I helped hex them.

384
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:01,811
You, you what?

385
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,292
Sharon, I'm part of a very powerful

386
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:09,346
group of witches and warlocks.

387
00:30:09,346 --> 00:30:12,335
We use the Crystal Force movies to

388
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:14,585
find others of our kind.

389
00:30:16,957 --> 00:30:21,070
Those people who were born
with dark magic powers.

390
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,074
The hex helps bring those powers to light.

391
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,241
I'm a witch.

392
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:31,442
Yes, you are.

393
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:36,277
And that's a very good thing.

394
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:38,446
Our coven is growing.

395
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:39,693
Soon we'll be one of the most powerful

396
00:30:39,693 --> 00:30:41,576
covens on the East coast.

397
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,310
And now, you're a part of that.

398
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:51,402
This is what we're gonna do.

399
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:54,408
I'm gonna take you back to
my place to get cleaned up.

400
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:56,470
And you'll get some rest.

401
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,425
And then some of the coven members

402
00:30:57,425 --> 00:31:00,008
will come and clean your house.

403
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,179
Yes, even Samuel's body.

404
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:08,345
And then I can answer any questions

405
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:09,845
that you may have.

406
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,124
And we'll go from there.

407
00:31:12,124 --> 00:31:13,407
Is that okay?

408
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,576
Or, I can just call the cops.

409
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,409
And you can go to jail for murder.

410
00:31:22,857 --> 00:31:25,940
So, my place?

411
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,984
God, I love doughnuts.

412
00:32:04,984 --> 00:32:06,884
Never touch them.

413
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,926
Wait, is that you saying that?

414
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:13,048
Or are you doing
some cop detective character work?

415
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:15,573
If you couldn't tell, I'm a genius.

416
00:32:15,773 --> 00:32:16,606
Sure.

417
00:32:21,112 --> 00:32:24,308
This is the Witch School
16 Freshman Year set, right?

418
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:25,141
Ah.

419
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:28,763
Yeah. Sort of,
in the broad sense of the word.

420
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:31,347
Great, I'm looking for Jamal,
the director.

421
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:32,360
Ah.

422
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,741
He's in there shooting a scene.

423
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:37,171
Oh, shit, that means I'm late.

424
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:38,398
You're in a scene?

425
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,637
Yeah, I'm playing Henry.

426
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:41,946
Patrick.

427
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:43,205
Garner.

428
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:44,425
Lutz.

429
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:45,841
Nice to meet you both.

430
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,165
The set's up there?

431
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:47,998
Thanks.

432
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,130
Holy shit.

433
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:55,962
That is one good looking man.

434
00:32:55,962 --> 00:32:57,625
And I'm not even gay.

435
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,914
Understatement of the century.

436
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:02,530
But isn't Samuel playing Henry again?

437
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,616
Maybe he's got
his character name mixed up.

438
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:06,907
He wasn't at the read through.

439
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:08,070
That's weird, I'll text Samuel

440
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,357
and see if he's got
a bigger gig or something.

441
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:13,046
Wait, you're not gay?

442
00:33:14,046 --> 00:33:14,879
No.

443
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,710
Huh, hmm.

444
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,542
Go ahead and say the first line.

445
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,010
Let me hear it.

446
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,897
"Uh-huh, I don't know what you mean.

447
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:27,732
"What power are you talking about?"

448
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:29,029
Okay, now, remember, she really

449
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:32,096
- wants him to help her, but not really.
- Okay.

450
00:33:32,103 --> 00:33:34,341
- Okay.
- Hi, Jamal?

451
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:35,425
- Hi.
- Apologies for being late.

452
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:36,793
No problem, none at all,

453
00:33:36,793 --> 00:33:39,836
we're just setting up a scene
with a few lights.

454
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:41,132
Rose, this is Patrick, he will be

455
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:44,527
taking over for Samuel
in the role of Henry.

456
00:33:44,527 --> 00:33:45,994
Yes, you are.

457
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:47,086
I mean, hi.

458
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:48,854
- Hi.
- Hello.

459
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:50,965
Have you had a chance
to look over the scene?

460
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:53,098
- Okay.
- All right.

461
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,855
So, why don't we rehearse a little bit

462
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:56,620
while Brian continues to set up lights.

463
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,708
And we'll go from there.

464
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:01,209
So, as a reminder, this was the first

465
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:04,393
seduction scene between Iris and Henry.

466
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:05,909
Now, remember, Iris is the mother

467
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:08,032
of your character in Crystal Force 14

468
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:11,321
and 15, so, let that inform you and use

469
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:13,268
whatever choices you wanna
make in this scene.

470
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:14,896
- Of course.
- Okay.

471
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:17,475
Let's have you move over just slightly.

472
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,431
- There, a little bit, right there.
- Okay.

473
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:20,586
And let's have you go over here.

474
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:21,744
These are your first positions.

475
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:23,411
- Okay.
- Let's give it a try.

476
00:34:25,388 --> 00:34:29,477
I can feel your power,
just standing here.

477
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:31,168
I don't know what you mean.

478
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:34,404
What power are you talking about?

479
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:36,570
The talent you possess inside you.

480
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,853
Locked away, forced down, by generations

481
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:42,718
of weak willed men and women.

482
00:34:42,718 --> 00:34:44,710
Who were frightened of
their true potential.

483
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,607
I don't know what you're talking about.

484
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:49,099
There's nothing special about me.

485
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:52,229
I have no talents, I'm powerless.

486
00:34:52,229 --> 00:34:54,059
You are not powerless.

487
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,392
Let me show you.

488
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,410
You scare me.

489
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:02,526
I should, let me in.

490
00:35:04,162 --> 00:35:07,675
Allow me to free the power inside you.

491
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:08,758
I'm afraid.

492
00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:12,410
Of course you are.

493
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,792
Will it hurt?

494
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,172
Yes.

495
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,867
Release me.

496
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,792
Open yourself to the power within you.

497
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:41,959
Free yourself.

498
00:35:44,092 --> 00:35:46,009
Ahhhhhhh!

499
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:04,311
That coffee
cold enough for you yet?

500
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:05,927
Huh?

501
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:08,682
The coffee, that
you've been meticulously

502
00:36:08,682 --> 00:36:11,515
preparing for the last 10 minutes.

503
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,125
Oh, no, it's fine.

504
00:36:15,094 --> 00:36:17,545
Sorry, I'm a little spacey at the moment.

505
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:19,162
I need to get back in there.

506
00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:20,388
For what?

507
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:23,334
Jamal wrapped us 15 minutes ago.

508
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:26,035
But I have a scene to shoot.

509
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:29,535
Girl, you already shot your scene today.

510
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:32,452
What's going on here?

511
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,572
Are you using?

512
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:36,645
What?

513
00:36:36,645 --> 00:36:38,769
No, oh, my God, no, no, I hate drugs.

514
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:42,269
I just, sorry, I'm just tired.

515
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:44,826
My day job's killing me.

516
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:45,874
We'll check the call sheet.

517
00:36:45,874 --> 00:36:47,585
You may have a couple days off.

518
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:50,304
I think Jamal is hosting
a screening for one

519
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:54,380
of the films, tomorrow at some point,
you should come.

520
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,797
I will, thanks.

521
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:59,005
All right, well, I'm outie.

522
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,823
I'll walk out with you.

523
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:10,421
- It's officially weird.
- What?

524
00:37:10,421 --> 00:37:12,166
Samuel and I aren't great friends,

525
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,285
but we hung out a couple of times

526
00:37:13,285 --> 00:37:14,382
since the last shoot.

527
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:17,374
He hasn't answered my texts
or my phone calls

528
00:37:17,374 --> 00:37:19,263
since being replaced on the film.

529
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:21,187
Well, maybe he got a location gig

530
00:37:21,187 --> 00:37:23,249
and he's on a plane right now.

531
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:24,568
Here's another weird thing.

532
00:37:24,568 --> 00:37:26,525
Greta is being replaced in the film.

533
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:29,097
That's what Ivan told me.

534
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:31,355
Oh, she got the pilot,
well, good for her.

535
00:37:31,355 --> 00:37:33,834
She only had a nine day shoot,
with only three scenes.

536
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,524
How could they find
a replacement so fast?

537
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:37,667
I have no idea.

538
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,811
I guess she's right about the curse.

539
00:37:39,811 --> 00:37:40,644
Garner!

540
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:43,038
Look, we've got two cast members

541
00:37:43,038 --> 00:37:44,551
getting gigs and then disappearing

542
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:46,189
right before the shoot date.

543
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:49,078
And Jamal happens to find
a replacement for Samuel?

544
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:50,940
Doesn't that seem kind of fishy to you?

545
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,876
Well, welcome to
low budget film production.

546
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:57,043
- So...
- So, we should investigate, seriously.

547
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,854
Please, I beg of you, stop doing

548
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:06,487
all this Uta Hagen,
background character work.

549
00:38:06,513 --> 00:38:10,192
This is Crystal Force 16,
trust me, you're good.

550
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:12,700
This is legit,
this isn't character work.

551
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,345
Whatever, I'm going for a drink.

552
00:38:15,345 --> 00:38:16,595
Are you coming?

553
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:20,245
No, I got stuff to do.

554
00:38:21,804 --> 00:38:24,137
Okay, see you.

555
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:38,277
Hey, you did a great job today.

556
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,317
I see why you came
so highly recommended.

557
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:42,956
Yeah. It was easy,
she was ripe for it.

558
00:38:45,357 --> 00:38:49,105
We've been cultivating
her since Crystal Force 14.

559
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:49,938
Really?

560
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:53,570
Yes, we've been here before.

561
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,225
And it hasn't worked out well.

562
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:59,302
There have been a lot of faith
placed on your assurances.

563
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:01,469
You can bring this to fruition for us.

564
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:06,667
I won't disappoint.

565
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:08,760
I can guarantee that.

566
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,343
What about Greta?

567
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:14,425
She took the other offer.

568
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:15,454
What about the role?

569
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,457
Do you have someone else to replace her?

570
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:19,154
I don't need to.

571
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:21,654
Look it was just a minor role.

572
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,293
I can do a rewrite.

573
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:04,512
Done, I think it's much tighter now.

574
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:07,137
I cleaned up some
extraneous action in act three.

575
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:10,390
Very clever, very clever.

576
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,171
The times for the coven's ascension
is almost upon us.

577
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:16,064
You have eight more days,

578
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:19,397
to call the most powerful,
from your production.

579
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:23,062
Then we're right on schedule.

580
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:25,903
Good, I must leave you now.

581
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:27,624
I mustn't be late.

582
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:29,369
Is there a coven meeting
I don't know about?

583
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:31,846
Actors showcase.

584
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:35,325
Thinking about changing
my representation.

585
00:40:35,325 --> 00:40:39,158
All right then, till next time.

586
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:45,618
All right, where was I?

587
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,004
Sharon,

588
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:21,289
Sharon,

589
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:24,824
Sharon?

590
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:26,336
Jamal?

591
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:30,573
Are you ready?

592
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:33,424
Yes, I've been

593
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,757
studying my lines all night.

594
00:41:38,985 --> 00:41:41,983
Are you ready to do
the Masters bidding?

595
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:46,733
Oh, that, yes, I'm ready.

596
00:41:48,431 --> 00:41:52,931
Tomorrow, you will choose
the strongest.

597
00:41:55,151 --> 00:42:00,318
Tomorrow, you will choose
the next member of the coven.

598
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:23,732
This is gonna be good.

599
00:42:46,927 --> 00:42:52,177
Tomorrow I will choose the strongest.

600
00:42:58,707 --> 00:43:00,734
Okay, what the fuck!

601
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:01,925
Did you get my messages?

602
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:04,260
Yes, I got your 500 messages.

603
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,825
Why do you think I'm here?

604
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:08,068
And today was my day off.

605
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:11,131
And, spoiler alert, I wasn't planning

606
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:13,222
on spending them with you.

607
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:14,526
What took you so long?

608
00:43:14,526 --> 00:43:15,921
The line was out the door.

609
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:17,060
Can we just get to the part where

610
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,055
you tell me why we're meeting
in a random parking lot?

611
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,165
Because I've got
something very important

612
00:43:22,165 --> 00:43:24,675
to talk to you about,
isn't quite enough.

613
00:43:24,675 --> 00:43:26,068
Do you remember what Greta said about

614
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:28,630
all the Crystal Force curses?

615
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,336
I'm leaving.

616
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:32,025
I know how it sounds,
but look at this, look at this.

617
00:43:32,025 --> 00:43:35,995
Okay, this is a list of all the actors

618
00:43:35,995 --> 00:43:38,662
who appeared in
all the Crystal Force films.

619
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:45,439
Why are most of the names
crossed off?

620
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,117
Most of the names are crossed off

621
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:50,511
because 90% of
all the actors quit the business.

622
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:53,328
Okay, so?

623
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,964
So, don't you think that's weird?

624
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:58,360
Not really, actors quit all the time.

625
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,586
Granted, but you know what?

626
00:43:59,586 --> 00:44:01,791
I did my research and
this is what I found.

627
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,488
I'm on the edge of my seat.

628
00:44:03,488 --> 00:44:06,529
None of the actors who quit
the Crystal Force films,

629
00:44:06,529 --> 00:44:07,436
have a Facebook page.

630
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,874
None of them except Samuel.

631
00:44:08,874 --> 00:44:10,538
And he hasn't touched his since

632
00:44:10,538 --> 00:44:12,697
the day before he disappeared.

633
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:17,297
Okay, I'm gonna ask you this

634
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:19,791
and I need you to
ell me the truth, okay?

635
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:20,866
Absolutely.

636
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,807
Are you on drugs?

637
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:22,834
No, I'm not on drugs.

638
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:24,439
I promise, I'm not on drugs.

639
00:44:24,439 --> 00:44:25,863
This is real.

640
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,858
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

641
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:29,083
This is Jamal.

642
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,803
We worked with him before.

643
00:44:30,803 --> 00:44:32,708
What are you gonna do,
quit the movie?

644
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:33,341
I don't know.

645
00:44:33,341 --> 00:44:35,985
Don't quit the movie,
don't be dumb.

646
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:39,016
Go home and get some rest

647
00:44:39,016 --> 00:44:41,193
and we can talk about this later.

648
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:48,980
Hey, guys, Crystal Force sequel screening

649
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,014
tonight at Sharon's, who's in?

650
00:44:52,014 --> 00:44:52,898
Don't go.

651
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:53,900
Garner.

652
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,591
Don't go.

653
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:57,519
What am I going to tell him?

654
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:58,960
I don't know?
Tell him that two actors want to

655
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,031
do their scene together.

656
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,226
What director wouldn't want
their actors to rehearse?

657
00:45:03,426 --> 00:45:08,926
Oh, my God, fine.

658
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:23,153
Can't make it, Garner and
I working on scenes, send.

659
00:45:23,935 --> 00:45:25,008
Thank you.

660
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:26,153
You owe me.

661
00:45:26,153 --> 00:45:28,477
You're taking me out tonight,
your treat.

662
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:32,446
So, go home, get some rest,
and come get me at 7:00.

663
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,896
Fucking actors!

664
00:45:49,098 --> 00:45:52,598
I don't know,
this role feels different.

665
00:45:53,939 --> 00:45:57,356
Different, how?

666
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:59,927
Like it's part of me.

667
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:02,805
Like it was written for me.

668
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:05,755
I know that sounds
completely pretentious.

669
00:46:06,755 --> 00:46:10,172
No, it makes perfect sense.

670
00:46:11,308 --> 00:46:14,433
We're a part of
something bigger now.

671
00:46:14,433 --> 00:46:16,035
Exactly, we're a part of something

672
00:46:16,035 --> 00:46:18,118
that's more than just us.

673
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,321
And doesn't it, it feels amazing.

674
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,568
Yes, like...

675
00:46:23,568 --> 00:46:26,160
Like we're taking charge.

676
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,423
Like we're not just waiting around

677
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:31,005
for someone to tell us
what to do anymore.

678
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:34,119
Like this city is our bitch.

679
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:38,119
Yes, I'm crazy, right?

680
00:46:38,986 --> 00:46:42,319
Negative, absolutely sane.

681
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,053
Okay, I didn't want to tell you,

682
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,936
but I have it on good authority

683
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:52,011
that Crystal Force is going to be

684
00:46:52,011 --> 00:46:54,831
huge for the both of us.

685
00:46:54,831 --> 00:46:56,369
What do you mean?

686
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:57,907
Did Jamal say something?

687
00:46:57,907 --> 00:46:59,972
Are we talking theatrical distribution?

688
00:46:59,972 --> 00:47:01,387
Sundance?

689
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:04,755
No, I mean, I'm talking about something

690
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,838
absolutely life changing.

691
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:08,954
Tell me.

692
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:14,708
Uh uh uh, you're gonna have to wait.

693
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:16,643
But just for a little bit longer.

694
00:47:16,643 --> 00:47:18,226
Oh, I can't wait.

695
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:22,032
Damn, why am I so wired?

696
00:47:22,032 --> 00:47:24,782
I feel like I could run
a marathon right now.

697
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,194
Hey, you.

698
00:47:32,194 --> 00:47:32,627
Hey.

699
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:33,710
Come on.

700
00:47:44,336 --> 00:47:50,653
Look who it is,
Will Tanner, aka Spanner.

701
00:47:50,715 --> 00:47:52,105
Hey, Will.

702
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:54,771
Hey, ladies, nice to see you again.

703
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:57,147
You ready to watch
the next Crystal Force movie?

704
00:47:57,147 --> 00:48:00,064
- Absolutely.
- Oh...

705
00:48:00,438 --> 00:48:03,031
Jamal sends his regrets.

706
00:48:03,031 --> 00:48:05,948
He's caught up in production again.

707
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:08,563
It looks like we're gonna have

708
00:48:08,563 --> 00:48:12,529
to watch the movie without him, or not.

709
00:48:12,529 --> 00:48:17,196
Yeah, you guys are fun, I think.

710
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:18,627
Eww.

711
00:48:19,467 --> 00:48:24,634
Or different idea, we can watch
a separate Crystal Force.

712
00:48:26,472 --> 00:48:29,063
I was just kidding, obviously.

713
00:48:29,063 --> 00:48:31,222
I mean, unless you're into it.

714
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:34,055
I wouldn't be joking at all, then.

715
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:39,610
And scene, okay, guys, movie time.

716
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,450
I've already seen this one.

717
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:45,700
So, I can go grab
some snacks or drinks.

718
00:48:46,747 --> 00:48:47,580
Beer?

719
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,952
Check.

720
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:50,627
Wine, red.

721
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,688
Check and chuck.

722
00:48:52,688 --> 00:48:54,688
I'll be back in a flash.

723
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:02,534
Thank God, she's gone, am I right?

724
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:04,575
Hey, no punching.

725
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,825
Watch the movie, dumb ass.

726
00:49:55,869 --> 00:49:57,909
Oh, my God, Garner,

727
00:49:57,909 --> 00:49:59,845
- I can't, even, with you right now.
- Shhh.

728
00:49:59,845 --> 00:50:00,928
Keep it down.

729
00:50:00,928 --> 00:50:01,779
Why?

730
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:03,404
He's not here.

731
00:50:03,404 --> 00:50:05,487
He's at Sharon's watching a DVD.

732
00:50:05,487 --> 00:50:07,030
Which is where we should be,
instead of

733
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:09,027
at the production office.

734
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:09,860
Would you keep it down?

735
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,021
The people on the street
are gonna hear us.

736
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:14,980
And we're gonna get arrested
for breaking and entering.

737
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,145
I need to go through this stuff

738
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:19,023
so, I can prove the Crystal Force curse.

739
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:22,478
Uh, first of all, we're not
breaking and entering anything.

740
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,693
I have the key.

741
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:25,294
I'm the associate producer.

742
00:50:25,294 --> 00:50:30,775
- And secondly, there is no Crystal Force curse.
- Shhh. Aha!

743
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:39,125
Oh, my God, you found it.

744
00:50:39,324 --> 00:50:42,407
Garner, you found a prop.

745
00:50:47,476 --> 00:50:50,726
Really, then how do you explain this?

746
00:50:53,548 --> 00:50:54,784
Each name at the top of the page

747
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:56,553
is the name of an actor
that has disappeared

748
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,970
from the Crystal Force films.

749
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,375
You're the one.

750
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:36,931
You bet I am.

751
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:37,636
- God, Kaley. Oh, yes, yes.
- Oh...

752
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:26,708
Awkward.

753
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:28,728
Ah, yeah.

754
00:53:32,707 --> 00:53:34,337
And they're done in red ink.

755
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:36,667
Which you think is?

756
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:38,306
Blood.

757
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:41,110
That's what I thought.

758
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,303
This book is full of drawings

759
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,511
made of actors that have disappeared

760
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,507
from the Crystal Force films.

761
00:53:45,507 --> 00:53:47,476
And what makes
you think that this is blood?

762
00:53:47,476 --> 00:53:49,315
That's what witches do.

763
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:50,992
Jesus Christ, Garner!

764
00:53:50,992 --> 00:53:52,218
Do you know that the prop department

765
00:53:52,218 --> 00:53:53,490
is gonna come in their pants,

766
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:54,879
when they realize that you thought

767
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:56,684
this thing was real?

768
00:53:56,684 --> 00:53:58,170
It's just a fun little thing,

769
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,678
that they write
the names of the actors

770
00:53:59,678 --> 00:54:02,258
from the past films in,
that we know about,

771
00:54:02,258 --> 00:54:03,635
but nobody else knows about,

772
00:54:03,635 --> 00:54:07,318
so we can talk about it on
the DVD commentary track.

773
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:10,290
Really, then how do you explain this?

774
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:18,479
Whoa.

775
00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:19,475
You see that?

776
00:54:19,675 --> 00:54:21,675
What the fuck is that?

777
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:36,237
The Master will only let
the strongest serve the coven.

778
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,285
All others will be slaughtered by Adul.

779
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:45,057
Fight, fight for your right
to serve the coven.

780
00:54:45,057 --> 00:54:48,474
Fight for your right
to serve the Master.

781
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:53,204
What's happened to me?

782
00:54:53,404 --> 00:54:56,154
The first Crystal Force movies,

783
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,736
they were just an audition.

784
00:54:59,736 --> 00:55:05,653
And now, you're at
the call back for your life.

785
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:12,822
I feel so strong.

786
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:13,834
Yes.

787
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,267
I feel like I could do anything.

788
00:55:17,267 --> 00:55:19,232
Yes!

789
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:22,512
I feel like
the fucking executive producer.

790
00:55:22,512 --> 00:55:23,762
Yes!

791
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,655
Sorry, Spanner, you're a nice guy,

792
00:55:28,655 --> 00:55:31,065
but the coven doesn't need
a character actor.

793
00:55:33,265 --> 00:55:35,098
Go Rose!

794
00:55:35,744 --> 00:55:36,944
You bitch!

795
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:59,357
Go Spanner!

796
00:56:13,694 --> 00:56:15,743
Did you get a video of that, Sharon?

797
00:56:15,943 --> 00:56:17,693
Best fail video ever.

798
00:56:21,884 --> 00:56:25,139
You need better tag lights,
sweetheart.

799
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:27,139
Wonderful job, Spanner.

800
00:56:28,475 --> 00:56:31,279
Master will be impressed.

801
00:56:31,279 --> 00:56:33,650
Now, finish her off.

802
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:37,567
And then we'll go get some cold,
pressed juice.

803
00:56:39,779 --> 00:56:43,826
You know I never leave
my work unfinished.

804
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:47,659
Hollywood could use
one less mediocre actress.

805
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:57,405
And actor with hair plugs.

806
00:57:39,763 --> 00:57:44,527
You've done good work, ladies.

807
00:57:49,152 --> 00:57:51,918
The Master will be pleased.

808
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:55,728
Thank you, Jamal.

809
00:57:55,728 --> 00:57:58,367
You're a credit to the coven.

810
00:57:58,367 --> 00:57:59,466
Thank you.

811
00:57:59,466 --> 00:58:00,299
Keep an eye out

812
00:58:00,299 --> 00:58:01,377
for your email, for the upcoming

813
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,569
shoot schedule and call sheets.

814
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:05,995
- Copy that.
- Copy that.

815
00:58:31,401 --> 00:58:32,408
I still don't understand

816
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:33,714
why you haven't quit the movie,

817
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:37,439
if you're so convinced Jamal
is some warlock mastermind.

818
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,334
Because if he's some warlock mastermind

819
00:58:39,334 --> 00:58:41,211
I wanna be able to see him.

820
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:42,560
If he's gonna use some ceremonial

821
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,948
knife and use my blood as his ink,

822
00:58:44,948 --> 00:58:46,950
I want him to do it in my face.

823
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,847
And if he's not,
you still want the credit.

824
00:58:49,847 --> 00:58:53,347
I'm a professional,
I made a commitment.

825
00:58:56,842 --> 00:58:57,977
Hello, actor people.

826
00:58:58,977 --> 00:59:02,383
Hey, there, looking forward to
our big scene today.

827
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:03,351
I know, right?

828
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:04,751
I love getting killed in horror movies.

829
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:06,842
Except you don't get to
come back for the sequel.

830
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:09,503
Not true, I was decapitated
in Heads will Roll,

831
00:59:09,503 --> 00:59:10,505
and they brought
me back as a living

832
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,854
head in a jar,
for Heads will Roll Two, Giving Head.

833
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,456
Nice.

834
00:59:15,456 --> 00:59:16,402
How about you, Garner?

835
00:59:16,402 --> 00:59:17,332
You ready to act the shit out of

836
00:59:17,332 --> 00:59:19,054
some shady witch business today?

837
00:59:19,054 --> 00:59:20,538
It's sure a shame
Greta has to miss it though.

838
00:59:20,538 --> 00:59:21,682
Garner!

839
00:59:21,682 --> 00:59:23,002
Greta?

840
00:59:23,402 --> 00:59:25,900
Yes, she was originally in this scene.

841
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,733
Was she?

842
00:59:26,742 --> 00:59:27,882
I don't remember that.

843
00:59:27,882 --> 00:59:29,879
I thought they weren't
bringing her back for the sequel?

844
00:59:29,879 --> 00:59:32,563
You don't remember her
at the table read?

845
00:59:32,563 --> 00:59:34,143
There were like, 12 people there.

846
00:59:34,143 --> 00:59:35,520
I would have remembered.

847
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,939
Are you fucking with me?

848
00:59:36,939 --> 00:59:39,058
No, just be careful in there.

849
00:59:39,058 --> 00:59:41,062
Of course, wait, what?

850
00:59:41,062 --> 00:59:42,290
What's up with you?

851
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:43,222
I'm just saying that there might

852
00:59:43,222 --> 00:59:45,626
be a certain force in the studio.

853
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:48,383
And I just want you to watch your back.

854
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:50,170
Is this some character thing
he's doing?

855
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,420
I can't even.

856
00:59:54,905 --> 00:59:56,659
Hello, stars.

857
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,109
- Hey, Jamal.
- Hey, Jamal.

858
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:00,942
I think we're ready
to rehearse this scene.

859
01:00:00,942 --> 01:00:02,025
Come on back.

860
01:00:16,521 --> 01:00:18,679
All right, welcome to set.

861
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:19,596
Come on in.

862
01:00:20,836 --> 01:00:23,536
Wow, this looks familiar.

863
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:27,933
Yes, we saved the set
from Crystal Force 14.

864
01:00:27,933 --> 01:00:29,536
A total Roger Korman move.

865
01:00:29,536 --> 01:00:32,203
Oh, thrifty, nice.

866
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:35,385
All right, so let's have you

867
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:39,552
- step up over here, hop up.
- Up.

868
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,054
Are you comfy?

869
01:00:47,054 --> 01:00:48,165
- Yep.
- All right.

870
01:00:48,165 --> 01:00:49,391
Okay, now on the day that we film

871
01:00:49,391 --> 01:00:51,345
we're gonna strap you
in this puppy.

872
01:00:51,345 --> 01:00:53,012
But we know you're used to that.

873
01:00:56,213 --> 01:00:59,546
Garner, you get the big toy.

874
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,995
Isn't this the cheese knife
from craft services?

875
01:01:02,995 --> 01:01:06,030
Yes, but it's the evil cheese knife

876
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,686
from craft services.

877
01:01:10,755 --> 01:01:11,756
Okay, so we're gonna rehearse this

878
01:01:11,756 --> 01:01:13,111
from the top of the scene.

879
01:01:13,111 --> 01:01:15,142
Uh, Lutz, you don't come in
until page two.

880
01:01:15,142 --> 01:01:16,746
So, sit this one out for a little bit.

881
01:01:16,746 --> 01:01:17,741
You got it, boss.

882
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:18,747
All right, awesome.

883
01:01:18,747 --> 01:01:20,691
I'm gonna start from
the top of the third act.

884
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:21,930
Now, I know you guys
know where that is

885
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,554
because you are professionals.

886
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:26,257
And you studied your scripts,
like good little actors.

887
01:01:26,457 --> 01:01:27,450
Yes, Jamal.

888
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,091
So, Detective Donahue,

889
01:01:29,091 --> 01:01:31,047
you have been possessed by
the evil Master,

890
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:33,251
who is also the leader of the coven.

891
01:01:33,251 --> 01:01:37,001
Now, he is about to
sacrifice this young lady.

892
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:41,937
Who has been kidnapped by
the coven.

893
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:45,215
But not before Detective Donahue
comes in

894
01:01:45,215 --> 01:01:47,395
and snaps him out.

895
01:01:47,795 --> 01:01:49,706
Right, keep the energy up.

896
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,373
And let's rehearse this one out.

897
01:01:54,529 --> 01:01:56,979
Detective, stop, it's me.

898
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,279
If you're still in there,

899
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:02,529
if the real Detective Gilmore
can still hear me, don't do this.

900
01:02:02,529 --> 01:02:04,946
Fight it, detective, fight it.

901
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:11,623
How dare you talk to me
in that manner.

902
01:02:11,623 --> 01:02:14,487
I am no mortal,
I am no man of flesh,

903
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:15,655
and blood, and mercy.

904
01:02:15,655 --> 01:02:17,955
And your please are useless.

905
01:02:17,955 --> 01:02:19,660
Wait, what's going on?

906
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,051
What happened to the lights?

907
01:02:21,051 --> 01:02:21,884
Jamal?

908
01:02:22,882 --> 01:02:25,965
There is no Jamal, only the Master.

909
01:02:27,004 --> 01:02:29,754
Garner, what are you doing?

910
01:02:29,754 --> 01:02:32,351
Oh, my God,
what happened to your eyes?

911
01:02:33,351 --> 01:02:37,031
I finally see a groveling whore,
I finally see.

912
01:02:38,031 --> 01:02:39,987
Jamal, this isn't funny.

913
01:02:39,987 --> 01:02:41,752
I don't need you scaring
the shit out of me.

914
01:02:41,752 --> 01:02:44,112
I'm not a method actress.

915
01:02:44,112 --> 01:02:47,275
Your pathetic cries
nurture my dark soul, whore.

916
01:02:47,275 --> 01:02:48,971
Your tears quench my thirst.

917
01:02:48,971 --> 01:02:52,965
And your blood will nurture our coven.

918
01:02:52,965 --> 01:02:55,924
Garner, stop, seriously stop.

919
01:02:56,124 --> 01:02:57,919
I don't know what
Jamal put you up to,

920
01:02:57,919 --> 01:02:59,669
but this isn't funny.

921
01:03:10,474 --> 01:03:11,307
No!

922
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:03,343
Hey, time to go, nice work today.

923
01:04:03,425 --> 01:04:05,516
Wait, Lutz, what's going on?

924
01:04:05,516 --> 01:04:07,142
What do you mean?

925
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:09,825
Well, I don't remember.

926
01:04:09,865 --> 01:04:11,290
Spit it out, Stanley Stutter.

927
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,373
I have a class to get to.

928
01:04:14,605 --> 01:04:15,855
Where's Tara?

929
01:04:17,313 --> 01:04:21,182
Home, I assume,
she left a couple hours ago.

930
01:04:21,382 --> 01:04:23,575
Come on, move it.

931
01:04:23,575 --> 01:04:26,028
Jamal asked me to lock up.

932
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,608
Actually I got to pull
some stuff together,

933
01:04:27,608 --> 01:04:29,559
I wrap some of my wardrobe.

934
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:30,525
I just lock it, right?

935
01:04:30,525 --> 01:04:33,084
Or will it lock up behind me
when I leave?

936
01:04:33,084 --> 01:04:35,147
Sure, just make sure

937
01:04:35,147 --> 01:04:37,023
and check it
before you walk away.

938
01:04:37,023 --> 01:04:39,109
Jamal will shit a brick,

939
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:41,279
if he finds out
it was unlocked overnight.

940
01:04:41,279 --> 01:04:42,302
Got it.

941
01:04:42,302 --> 01:04:43,135
Later.

942
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:38,028
Hey, Patrick, what's up?

943
01:05:38,228 --> 01:05:41,553
I was just about to
ask you the same thing.

944
01:05:41,553 --> 01:05:42,859
Didn't you guys wrap an hour ago?

945
01:05:42,859 --> 01:05:44,801
Oh, yeah, man, long day.

946
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:46,975
Just wanted to come in here
and chill out for a little bit.

947
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:49,730
And then I realized that
I forgot tomorrow's call sheet.

948
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:52,689
So, I came in here to grab one.

949
01:05:52,689 --> 01:05:54,929
Doesn't Jamal email them
during lunch each day?

950
01:05:54,929 --> 01:05:57,440
Yeah, man, it's like,

951
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,289
you know, it sucks,
those spam filters.

952
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,228
You know man, they just like,

953
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:04,771
so, I just, what brings you in here?

954
01:06:04,771 --> 01:06:07,369
Well, I'm an associate producer.

955
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:09,490
You're the associate producer too?

956
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,399
I have certain skills
that are useful

957
01:06:11,399 --> 01:06:13,422
for productions like this.

958
01:06:13,422 --> 01:06:15,905
Jamal just lucked out
when he cast me, I guess.

959
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,822
- Oh, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

960
01:06:19,499 --> 01:06:20,673
Well, you know, I just came in

961
01:06:20,673 --> 01:06:22,371
to jump on some stuff for tomorrow,

962
01:06:22,371 --> 01:06:24,859
while it's quiet in here.

963
01:06:24,859 --> 01:06:30,926
Mmm, okay, uh, you know man,
it's been a long day.

964
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:33,148
So, I'm gonna hit the road.

965
01:06:34,259 --> 01:06:36,244
You know, I'll see you later man.

966
01:06:36,244 --> 01:06:37,170
Have a good one.

967
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:38,670
Have a good one.

968
01:06:57,554 --> 01:07:00,271
Hey, Garner, what now?

969
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,069
Did you catch Jamal killing a goat

970
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:04,069
in a pentagram,
while drinking a virgin's blood?

971
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:09,692
Hey, Lutz, you know that Patrick guy?

972
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,701
Samuel replacement?

973
01:07:11,701 --> 01:07:15,160
Only that he's fucking gorgeous.

974
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,898
Yeah, he's the associate producer

975
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:19,195
of Crystal Force 16 Freshman Year.

976
01:07:19,195 --> 01:07:22,426
Are you fucking kidding me?

977
01:07:22,426 --> 01:07:26,593
Oh, my God, I'm gonna kill Jamal.

978
01:07:26,634 --> 01:07:28,509
My agent got me that credit

979
01:07:28,509 --> 01:07:32,459
because he's still paying me shit,
after all these films.

980
01:07:32,459 --> 01:07:35,012
And then, I made him give me a key

981
01:07:35,012 --> 01:07:37,939
because an AP should have a key, right?

982
01:07:37,939 --> 01:07:41,269
I mean, yes, I might wanna have sex

983
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:44,062
on that set sometime, but still.

984
01:07:44,062 --> 01:07:45,525
Lutz.

985
01:07:45,525 --> 01:07:48,693
What did this guy do
to get an AP credit?

986
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:52,146
He said he had quote,
"Certain skills."

987
01:07:52,146 --> 01:07:55,813
Holy shit, he's blowing Jamal.

988
01:07:56,357 --> 01:07:59,293
I had no idea that guy was gay.

989
01:07:59,293 --> 01:08:00,781
But that's not the big news.

990
01:08:00,781 --> 01:08:03,677
That's pretty big news.

991
01:08:03,677 --> 01:08:05,965
I took the leather book
from the office.

992
01:08:05,965 --> 01:08:07,233
What?

993
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:09,587
I took the leather book from the office

994
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:11,766
and there's a new drawing in there.

995
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:14,077
And you know who's name is
at the top of the page?

996
01:08:14,277 --> 01:08:15,221
Tara's.

997
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:17,638
Why did you take that book?

998
01:08:20,534 --> 01:08:25,701
Garner, you need to take
that book back, seriously.

999
01:08:26,692 --> 01:08:30,192
You need to take the book
back to the set.

1000
01:08:40,641 --> 01:08:41,982
So, you believe me now.

1001
01:08:41,982 --> 01:08:43,431
Give me that!

1002
01:08:43,431 --> 01:08:45,934
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

1003
01:08:45,934 --> 01:08:47,031
Alex, that's evidence.

1004
01:08:47,031 --> 01:08:48,914
We need to take it to the police.

1005
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:50,375
And do what?

1006
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,061
Tell them that the cast of a long,

1007
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:54,565
running, direct to video horror franchise

1008
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:57,991
is being murdered, one by one,
by the executive producer?

1009
01:08:57,991 --> 01:08:59,631
Something like that.

1010
01:08:59,631 --> 01:09:02,557
Because that works so well
in the Crystal Force films.

1011
01:09:02,557 --> 01:09:04,244
Why are you so worked up over
this book?

1012
01:09:04,244 --> 01:09:06,566
Yesterday, you were treating it
as a prop.

1013
01:09:06,566 --> 01:09:10,341
It is a prop,
a very important prop.

1014
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:11,269
I knew that.

1015
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:13,038
You didn't know it.

1016
01:09:13,038 --> 01:09:17,038
This is a prop, but it isn't a book.

1017
01:09:17,656 --> 01:09:18,489
What?

1018
01:09:19,568 --> 01:09:23,068
This is a demon.

1019
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:25,334
A demon, as in?

1020
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:29,474
Yes, and this building
is a gateway to Hades.

1021
01:09:29,474 --> 01:09:32,905
You mean this yoga studio
is a gateway to hell.

1022
01:09:32,905 --> 01:09:35,307
Okay, when you say it
like that it sounds dumb,

1023
01:09:35,307 --> 01:09:36,474
but it's true.

1024
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,881
Back up.

1025
01:09:38,881 --> 01:09:40,715
If you'd really done your research,

1026
01:09:40,715 --> 01:09:41,816
you would have realized that

1027
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:44,327
this piece of land
was used as a location

1028
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:47,239
in every single Crystal Force film.

1029
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:49,866
And before that,
it was the location

1030
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:52,152
of a gruesome,
ritual murder by students

1031
01:09:52,152 --> 01:09:54,003
of the black arts.

1032
01:09:54,003 --> 01:09:56,609
And this book, as you call it,

1033
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,226
was born in this building.

1034
01:09:59,169 --> 01:10:00,945
The cover is the flesh
of a day player

1035
01:10:00,945 --> 01:10:03,071
on the first Crystal Force film.

1036
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:07,456
The blood of all the actors
adorns all its pages.

1037
01:10:07,456 --> 01:10:09,107
Their souls are embedded in the earth

1038
01:10:09,107 --> 01:10:10,275
beneath this building.

1039
01:10:10,275 --> 01:10:14,462
And in the walls,
and between the covers of this book.

1040
01:10:14,462 --> 01:10:16,212
We have to return it.

1041
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,640
How do you know all this?

1042
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:29,713
Because I'm the fucking Master,
that's why.

1043
01:10:29,713 --> 01:10:31,380
You're the Master?

1044
01:10:32,684 --> 01:10:36,215
Didn't you wonder why
I was in so many of these movies?

1045
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:38,224
You're the Master?

1046
01:10:39,224 --> 01:10:40,825
Why are you asking me like that?

1047
01:10:40,825 --> 01:10:42,820
Because I'm a woman?

1048
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:46,040
No, because you're
the associate producer.

1049
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,102
Oh, oh, no, that's just a fake title

1050
01:10:49,102 --> 01:10:51,212
to keep people off my trail.

1051
01:10:51,212 --> 01:10:53,501
I know, you killed Samuel,
you killed Greta,

1052
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:54,657
and you killed Tara.

1053
01:10:54,657 --> 01:10:56,144
And Spanner.

1054
01:10:56,144 --> 01:10:57,907
Holy shit.

1055
01:10:57,907 --> 01:11:00,171
Well, not hands on.

1056
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:04,208
My minion, Jamal,
here did most of the dirty work.

1057
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:05,990
And Sharon and Rose helped.

1058
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,573
And of course, Ivan, and Brian.

1059
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:11,115
But why?

1060
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:16,518
The dark arts have
a firm grip on Hollywood, my friend.

1061
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:19,310
There are thousands
of magic practitioners

1062
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:25,060
all through Los Angeles
and, ugh, the Valley.

1063
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:28,343
The Valley witches are the worst.

1064
01:11:28,343 --> 01:11:33,152
Agreed, our coven is
one of the strongest.

1065
01:11:33,152 --> 01:11:36,686
But still too weak to
really control the region.

1066
01:11:36,686 --> 01:11:39,849
So, tonight, courtesy of this book,

1067
01:11:39,849 --> 01:11:44,032
and your soul,
we are going to

1068
01:11:44,095 --> 01:11:49,455
awaken the dark powers of
every unsuspecting witch within 10 miles.

1069
01:11:49,655 --> 01:11:51,025
To what end?

1070
01:11:51,025 --> 01:11:53,726
We're going to build a witch army.

1071
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,444
And then we're going to
take over this town.

1072
01:11:56,444 --> 01:12:00,841
And we're gonna rule it
in true Hollywood style,

1073
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:02,262
from the studios.

1074
01:12:02,262 --> 01:12:04,218
You're insane.

1075
01:12:04,218 --> 01:12:07,801
Um, I prefer creative genius.

1076
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:12,689
Jamal, bind his feet to the floor.

1077
01:12:13,635 --> 01:12:16,485
Alex, don't, we're friends.

1078
01:12:16,685 --> 01:12:18,055
Are we?

1079
01:12:18,055 --> 01:12:20,722
I would say we're more friendly.

1080
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:26,166
Enough, Jamal, take your place.

1081
01:12:27,964 --> 01:12:32,047
And we begin.

1082
01:13:25,543 --> 01:13:27,346
Can you feel that?

1083
01:13:27,346 --> 01:13:30,096
It worked, it worked.

1084
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:56,782
What the hell?

1085
01:13:56,782 --> 01:13:58,518
Who did that?

1086
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,310
Who did that?

1087
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,060
Who killed my minion?

1088
01:14:11,237 --> 01:14:12,404
Hello, Lutz.

1089
01:14:14,019 --> 01:14:15,917
Are you kidding me?

1090
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:17,437
I knew you were the Master.

1091
01:14:17,437 --> 01:14:18,794
I totally called that one.

1092
01:14:18,794 --> 01:14:20,936
Oh, my God, liar!

1093
01:14:20,936 --> 01:14:23,936
You so thought it was Ivan, that DP.

1094
01:14:25,352 --> 01:14:28,981
Yes, I'm the Master,
and who are you?

1095
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:30,522
I am the Master.

1096
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:31,805
Impossible.

1097
01:14:32,595 --> 01:14:34,753
Just like an actress.

1098
01:14:34,753 --> 01:14:36,349
All covens have Masters.

1099
01:14:36,349 --> 01:14:38,554
I am the Orange County Master.

1100
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:43,139
We control everything outside
of Los Angeles County.

1101
01:14:43,139 --> 01:14:46,722
And I'm here to add
Hollywood to that list.

1102
01:14:48,065 --> 01:14:51,862
And what are you two dumb asses doing?

1103
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:52,945
I turned you.

1104
01:14:54,046 --> 01:14:56,698
What, are you gonna tell me
that you're his now?

1105
01:14:57,698 --> 01:14:59,686
Don't call me a dumb ass.

1106
01:14:59,686 --> 01:15:01,540
I'm a witch now too.

1107
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:02,983
I have powers.

1108
01:15:11,366 --> 01:15:12,743
Sharon?

1109
01:15:13,143 --> 01:15:14,893
I belong to no one.

1110
01:15:16,723 --> 01:15:23,890
I'm with Patrick, because,
well, he's the strongest.

1111
01:15:26,638 --> 01:15:28,693
We'll see about that.

1112
01:15:31,757 --> 01:15:34,753
You may be the Orange County Master

1113
01:15:34,753 --> 01:15:37,991
but we do things differently,
here in the big city.

1114
01:15:41,097 --> 01:15:42,840
There's an order to things.

1115
01:16:04,568 --> 01:16:08,401
Good effort,
Orange County Master.

1116
01:16:08,849 --> 01:16:11,362
It's nice to see
we have such talent

1117
01:16:11,362 --> 01:16:14,445
for the supporting roles.

1118
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:23,855
It's three against to one, Lutz.

1119
01:16:30,376 --> 01:16:33,171
You're right, you did make me.

1120
01:16:33,571 --> 01:16:37,059
But that means I'm just as powerful.

1121
01:16:39,474 --> 01:16:41,256
God damn it.

1122
01:16:41,456 --> 01:16:45,559
And there's one other thing,
I'm younger.

1123
01:16:49,507 --> 01:16:51,268
What are you doing?

1124
01:16:51,268 --> 01:16:53,185
How did you learn that?

1125
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:58,683
Aw, Patrick taught me.

1126
01:16:58,683 --> 01:17:00,370
She's a quick study.

1127
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:02,597
I see big things for her.

1128
01:17:02,597 --> 01:17:04,930
Uh-huh, thank you.

1129
01:17:07,065 --> 01:17:10,148
Now, let's finish this.

1130
01:17:12,592 --> 01:17:16,425
No, don't, you don't know
what you're doing.

1131
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:21,607
Patrick, you can stop this.

1132
01:17:28,956 --> 01:17:32,292
And that's a wrap, on the Master.

1133
01:17:32,292 --> 01:17:35,330
Hmm. What do we do now?

1134
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:38,163
Take over Hollywood.

1135
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:41,273
Oh, my God,
this is so exciting.

1136
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:43,443
Yeah, but what are we gonna do

1137
01:17:43,443 --> 01:17:45,209
about all the witches and warlocks

1138
01:17:45,209 --> 01:17:47,280
that were affected by Lutz's spell?

1139
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,085
They'll find their way to us,
don't worry.

1140
01:17:55,933 --> 01:17:56,886
Patrick what's going on?

1141
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:58,136
I don't know.

1142
01:18:05,151 --> 01:18:08,288
Lutz, oh, my God,
thank God, you're okay.

1143
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:14,216
Okay, I know the box was overkill.

1144
01:18:14,216 --> 01:18:18,299
I was just trying to impress Patrick, huh.

1145
01:18:27,491 --> 01:18:31,058
So, here we are, alone at last.

1146
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:36,134
Apparently, we seem to
have lost all of our minions.

1147
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,671
I can always send out
another casting call.

1148
01:18:40,671 --> 01:18:43,491
One great thing about Hollywood,

1149
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:47,155
minions are an endlessly
renewable resource.

1150
01:18:48,525 --> 01:18:51,025
Spoken like a true producer.

1151
01:18:51,895 --> 01:18:54,395
Now, back to work.

1152
01:19:05,302 --> 01:19:10,452
Enough, we're obviously equal in power.

1153
01:19:11,007 --> 01:19:13,953
There's no reason we should fight.

1154
01:19:13,953 --> 01:19:16,359
What we should be doing
is working together.

1155
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:19,259
The Los Angeles coven and
the Orange County coven?

1156
01:19:19,659 --> 01:19:22,044
When was the last time anybody from LA

1157
01:19:22,044 --> 01:19:24,860
had anything good to say
about the Orange County?

1158
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,586
As they say,
"Keep your friends close."

1159
01:19:28,786 --> 01:19:31,614
We have a whole city full of witches

1160
01:19:31,614 --> 01:19:34,798
and warlocks to bring into the fold.

1161
01:19:34,798 --> 01:19:39,565
Our dark arts army will be too big
for only one Master.

1162
01:19:39,607 --> 01:19:41,084
Keep talking.

1163
01:19:41,484 --> 01:19:44,618
Besides, I'll need help recasting

1164
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:48,451
and re-crewing
Crystal Force 16 Freshman Year.

1165
01:19:53,184 --> 01:19:54,576
What's my credit?

1166
01:19:55,176 --> 01:19:58,805
Above the title cast,
producer credit, no points.

1167
01:19:59,005 --> 01:19:59,838
What?

1168
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:01,066
Prove yourself on this one

1169
01:20:01,066 --> 01:20:03,269
and we'll offer you points
on the next one.

1170
01:20:03,269 --> 01:20:05,548
If I survive the next one.

1171
01:20:05,548 --> 01:20:07,258
Unfortunately, story may dictate

1172
01:20:07,258 --> 01:20:09,925
that you do not make the sequel.

1173
01:20:12,176 --> 01:20:14,247
I guess I'll take my chances.

1174
01:20:14,847 --> 01:20:17,183
At least something for my reel.

1175
01:20:17,183 --> 01:20:18,016
Deal.

1176
01:20:22,721 --> 01:20:24,646
By the way, you do realize,

1177
01:20:24,646 --> 01:20:27,422
killing Jamal has set us
back even further?

1178
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:30,866
Now we have to find a warlock
that knows how to direct.

1179
01:20:30,866 --> 01:20:33,282
Hmmm, how about demons.

1180
01:20:34,282 --> 01:20:37,449
Sadly, they tend to kill the extras.

1181
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:41,068
Let's go have a drink.
