1
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:27,129
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

2
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,299
<i>We have polluted</i>
<i>and peopled this planet</i>

3
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,509
<i>to the brink of extinction.</i>

4
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:37,139
<i>We are destroying our world</i>
<i>at a suicidal pace.</i>

5
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,559
We need a pollution revolution.

6
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,187
And it's not going to be easy

7
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,523
<i>because the world is addicted to petroleum.</i>

8
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,193
<i>We have limited resources</i>

9
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,612
<i>and we go to war to protect them.</i>

10
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,327
<i>We need a new technology</i>

11
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,454
<i>and this technology</i>

12
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,456
<i>can't be sold.</i>

13
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,250
It must be given away

14
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,877
to everyone.

15
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:11,757
<i>We are in sight of a dream.</i>

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,384
<i>There is a solution.</i>

17
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,428
<i>The answer</i>

18
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,932
is all around us... right here.

19
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,519
Water. H2O.
Two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen.

20
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,897
<i>There is enough energy</i>

21
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,066
in this glass of water

22
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,777
to power the city of Chicago for weeks.

23
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,154
It's the hydrogen we're after.

24
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,329
<i>This is what happens when we burn it.</i>

25
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,250
<i>It's perfectly clean.</i>

26
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,586
<i>You can burn it when you want to,</i>
<i>in a car, in a turbine,</i>

27
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:55,509
<i>or in your own basement power supply</i>
<i>next to your water heater.</i>

28
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:59,346
<i>But what if we could release</i>
<i>this energy efficiently?</i>

29
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,432
<i>We will transform the world.</i>

30
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>Maybe we start to put an end to war.</i>

31
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,524
Of course, we have to make it work first.

32
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,997
Morning!

33
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,669
Hey, James, how are you doing?

34
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,005
Hey, Eddie, cold enough for you?

35
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,174
It's never too cold.

36
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,308
Hey, Lu! You want me to set up?

37
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,601
Yeah, right away.

38
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,569
Hello, Mr Shannon.

39
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,322
Mr Shannon, the big man, how are you?

40
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,534
Alistair.

41
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,037
- Did you have a good trip?
- Very good.

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,332
- Hi, can I get you some coffee?
- I'm fine, thank you.

43
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:12,336
I turn on the laser here.
We should focus it in the centre of the bubble.

44
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,671
- How's it going?
- You didn't get my fax?

45
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,007
I did. I didn't understand the figures.

46
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,343
We need to control the bubble.

47
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,970
The regulator isn't working.

48
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:25,098
Eddie, did you computer-model
your work last night?

49
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,476
No, I was too busy building it.

50
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,521
We sustained fusion for 4.6 milliseconds.

51
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,689
Stable?

52
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,901
It's stable... for 4.6 milliseconds.

53
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,861
Let me show you. Come, come.

54
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:42,950
The power input and output
is fine at this stage.

55
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:47,704
The output drops to nothing
at stage three, so what happened?

56
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,873
Paul!

57
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,167
All right, I gotta go.

58
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,263
Cross your fingers, everyone.

59
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,139
Good luck.

60
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,944
Mr Chen. Initiate laser.

61
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,446
Initiate laser.

62
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,669
Hydrogen separation in progress.

63
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,507
Initiate hydrogen burn.

64
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,770
Two million kelvin and rising.

65
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,732
Shut it down!

66
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,775
It's unstable. Shut it down.

67
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:10,996
We learned something important.
We found another way that didn't work.

68
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,832
We need to keep our minds open
and try again.

69
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,565
Alistair.

70
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,984
- It's working.
<i>- Is it stable?</i>

71
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,485
Yeah, it's stable.

72
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,113
- Completely stable.
<i>- My God!</i>

73
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,575
- We go tomorrow.
<i>- Tomorrow, Alistair.</i>

74
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,833
Lily, talk to me.

75
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,961
Temperature, gas flow,
acoustic drive steadied.

76
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,006
- The regulator has stabilised the reaction.
- Lucasz.

77
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,009
My spectrometer shows
stable hydrogen production.

78
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,637
We're getting more out than we put in.

79
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,354
I think you'd better sell your utility stocks.

80
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,137
- Whoa, Mr Chidi!
- Unbelievable!

81
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,306
You're going to be famous.

82
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,475
Thanks for everything.

83
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,852
We want more money!

84
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,812
Thanks for your trust.

85
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,578
I got it, I got it!

86
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,080
Here comes crazy Eddie!

87
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,673
Congratulations. I am quite impressed.

88
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,008
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

89
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:14,304
I never agreed to keep
anything from anyone.

90
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:18,267
Mandela will get this information,
China will find out...

91
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,853
Go anywhere, but don't move an inch.

92
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,481
I can't tell you what could happen...

93
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,650
This is no time to be serious.

94
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,235
Everybody's waiting.

95
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,404
Come on, Alistair!

96
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,449
OK, everybody.

97
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,328
Holy shit, we did it!

98
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,081
Holy shit, we did it!

99
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,044
One love

100
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,630
One heart

101
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,340
Let's get together and...

102
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,519
Your battery's dead.

103
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,648
There's ice all over the dashboard.

104
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,942
- How do I get home?
- I'll get you home.

105
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:11,111
We'll take my bike.

106
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,448
Oh, yes, please!

107
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,617
Where do you live?

108
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,785
I live in England.

109
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:24,833
No, sorry, I live on Kimbark and 54th.

110
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,920
- Kimbark and 54th?
- Mm-hm.

111
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,881
We can't. You'll freeze to death.

112
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,050
Erm...

113
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,178
Let's take a taxi.

114
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,347
- Taxi, huh?
- Uh-huh.

115
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,685
We've got a better chance
of getting picked up by a UFO.

116
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,857
Mr Chen, upload everything.

117
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:51,109
I want it on the Internet tonight.

118
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,111
We'll wake up a lot of people.

119
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,323
Damn right. Really wake them up.

120
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,082
Barkley...

121
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:29,523
We don't have the computer model ready.
We have the frequency.

122
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,775
We'll send it to you in one hour.

123
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,153
Yeah, yeah, in one hour.

124
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,494
Where are you going?

125
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,665
Chen?

126
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,593
- Here we are.
- This is Alistair's house.

127
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:01,054
Isn't he sweet?
He lets me live on the third floor.

128
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:04,016
Mmm. This... way.

129
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,560
Is this... is this what drunk is?

130
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,896
You've never been drunk?

131
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,064
I've never been this.

132
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,152
Lily's too serious.

133
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,070
She's no fun.

134
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,239
I think you're fun.

135
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,912
Good night, Lily.

136
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,542
Wow!

137
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,628
Alistair!

138
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,383
Alistair!

139
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,303
Chen!

140
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,123
Chen!

141
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,959
Chen!

142
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,878
Get ready.

143
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,558
Shannon.

144
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,061
<i>- Paul? Alistair's dead.</i>
- Eddie?

145
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,230
<i>I found him on the lab floor.</i>

146
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,399
<i>- He was murdered.</i>
- What?

147
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:49,551
Just what caused the explosion
last night is still unclear.

148
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:53,805
University officials say
this mill site had been converted

149
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:57,643
for the experimental production
of hydrogen fuel.

150
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,437
They say that's not supposed
to be dangerous.

151
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,566
One question law enforcement officials
are trying to determine

152
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,860
is whether foul play was involved.

153
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,530
As we indicate, that's unconfirmed.

154
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:14,451
But an FBI agent has said, and it was reported
by a Bureau spokesperson,

155
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,954
that no nuclear device went off.

156
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,206
There was no atomic explosion.

157
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,835
As far as you know,
are all your people accounted for?

158
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,003
Miss Sinclair? Is this all the group?

159
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,631
Alistair didn't come home last night.

160
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,675
Lu Chen is nowhere to be found.

161
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,177
I phoned him and he's not anywhere.

162
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,346
I started CPR.

163
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,974
I checked for breath, there was no breath.

164
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,059
I checked and there was no pulse.

165
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:41,019
I continued with the CPR.

166
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:54,324
Have the locals move
the perimeter back about 1,000 ft.

167
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:55,784
You got it.

168
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,036
Find me a friendly Federal judge.

169
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,666
I want wiretap orders, search warrants
on everyone that worked here.

170
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,879
Inspector Ford, you've taken
charge of this investigation.

171
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,672
Why is the FBI involved?

172
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,716
Eight city blocks disappeared.

173
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,135
The President talked to my boss at 3am.

174
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,928
He wants answers.

175
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,446
Tell me about Eddie.

176
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,156
Does he drink, do drugs?

177
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,742
No. He's just a machinist,

178
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:40,829
an undergraduate working to get his degree.

179
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:45,542
<i>That's the undisclosed cost</i>
<i>of our cheap fossil fuel.</i>

180
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,711
Who'd be interested in this?

181
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,881
Cheap, clean,

182
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,716
abundant energy?

183
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,885
Who wouldn't?

184
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,475
When you left the party, who was there?

185
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,018
Eddie.

186
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:08,106
So, Eddie, tell us again why you came back?

187
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,487
I'd come back for my bike.

188
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,865
You say you'd returned
from taking Miss Sinclair home.

189
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:20,410
Yeah. Her car wouldn't start,
so I took her home on the bus.

190
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:23,372
What is your relationship with Miss Sinclair?

191
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,625
Er... We work together.

192
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,211
I'm a machinist, she's a physicist.

193
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,797
I was

194
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,092
hired by Dr Chen.

195
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,510
And who is Dr Chen?

196
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,679
He was Dr Barkley's

197
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,473
project manager.

198
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,016
Why did he hire you?

199
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,185
Because I'm a physicist.

200
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,107
Gentlemen, what have we got here?
Sergeant?

201
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,401
I think we have Mr Chen in the wind.

202
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,445
Nick, what did you find?

203
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:59,074
It looks like he packed with a shovel.
He was in a hurry.

204
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:04,079
Dr Barkley expressed interest
in a specialist in sonoluminescence.

205
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,622
He knew about Dr Chen.

206
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:09,126
So through some friends
in the State Department,

207
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,295
I got him here and onto the team.

208
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,797
You have friends in the State Department?

209
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,635
We have influential members of the board.

210
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,761
Really?

211
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,139
Who's on the board of your foundation?

212
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,558
Ford.

213
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,101
Various scientists...

214
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,060
Yeah.

215
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,645
...and industrialists.

216
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:30,772
Your Dr Chen is missing.

217
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:33,150
Any idea where he might be?

218
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,612
He may be dead.

219
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,155
We have no comment.

220
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,617
Eddie Kasalivich!
You said they killed him.

221
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,118
Who killed him, Eddie?

222
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:46,622
You were there before the explosion.
What happened?

223
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,041
What are you looking for?

224
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,503
We're just examining
the articles on his desk.

225
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,214
- How are you entitled to do that?
- Annette!

226
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:59,092
They have a search warrant,
but no respect for a man's life.

227
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,053
I want a full inventory.

228
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:04,806
These are very important,
sensitive scientific papers.

229
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,267
- We'll give you copies.
- Signed, please!

230
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:11,396
<i>For two decades, Doctor Barkley...</i>

231
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,025
I have to speak
to the university's legal counsel.

232
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,361
Please give Lily any help you can.

233
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,530
I can't stay here tonight.

234
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:26,495
<i>Among the missing is Dr Lu Chen,</i>
<i>who the authorities are looking for.</i>

235
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,164
<i>He may be considered a suspect...</i>

236
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:32,376
- This is insane.
- They're going to think he did it.

237
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,887
Oh, no.

238
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,223
- What is it?
- It's from

239
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,268
Dr Lu Chen.

240
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:53,313
He wants me
to bring the rest of the information,

241
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:56,733
all the data and meet him
at the rendezvous in Shanghai.

242
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,909
I'm being framed.

243
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,579
What are you talking about?

244
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,415
- This isn't from Chen.
- How do you know?

245
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,418
- He doesn't write like this.
- Then who sent it?

246
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,587
I don't know who sent it.

247
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,964
Where's Chen?

248
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:22,467
You don't think he did it?

249
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,685
Let's er...

250
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:34,104
Let's get outta here, OK?

251
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,499
Can I help you?

252
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:58,003
I sure hope so.
We're looking for Mr Paul Shannon.

253
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,172
He's on the phone right now.

254
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,300
Excuse me, you can't go in there!

255
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,718
You can't go in!

256
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,304
<i>There's a lot to explain.</i>

257
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,598
I'll call you back.

258
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,644
What now, Agent Ford?

259
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,480
We've received Eddie Kasalivich's file.

260
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:21,026
He left college for disciplinary reasons.
He blew the hell out of the lab.

261
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:24,363
- This is a coincidence!
- You knew he was kicked out of school?

262
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,907
He resigned.

263
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,035
- Under some pressure?
- There was some pressure, yes.

264
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:33,413
- He blows up a building...
- Minor structural damage.

265
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:36,583
It was an interesting experiment.
It might have worked.

266
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:40,170
Didn't you think
this information was important?

267
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:42,548
I don't see the relevance.

268
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:47,052
- You don't see a small connection?
- No, Agent Ford, I don't.

269
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,556
The CIA tells me
Chen might be involved in espionage.

270
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,766
Kasalivich's past makes me nervous.

271
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,521
And Miss Sinclair is receiving faxes
inviting her to mainland China.

272
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:05,070
Really?

273
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,949
Really.

274
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:26,758
What's wrong?

275
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,473
That's my place.

276
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,894
Let's get outta here.

277
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:50,157
- It's a real shithole.
- How much does this guy make?

278
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,326
Not much, he's a student machinist.

279
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,162
- Sheen, why are you outside?
- Stay warm, buddy!

280
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,706
Got a loft for your mother.
Very artistic.

281
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,959
- Who's upstairs?
- Everybody. Half the city.

282
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:09,092
- Do you want to check that cabinet?
- I got it.

283
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,387
Jesus, you could put together
almost anything here.

284
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:13,722
I want all this.

285
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:17,017
All right! We need a total lab workup.

286
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:20,062
It's er... a neutron cappuccino machine.

287
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:23,690
Yeah, don't touch it.

288
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,449
Hey, Nick! What's this?

289
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:34,618
It's a transmitter.

290
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,954
It's a burst transmitter.

291
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,413
What does it do?

292
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:42,125
It sends massive amounts
of information by satellite

293
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,169
probably to China.

294
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,680
Nick! Doyle!

295
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:59,351
<i>Calls flooded into</i>
<i>the University Of Chicago</i>

296
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:02,980
<i>from all over the world,</i>
<i>enquiring about the professor.</i>

297
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:06,275
<i>Concern came from</i>
<i>the Royal Academy in London,</i>

298

<i>from Paris, Moscow</i>

<i>But at the same time,</i>
<i>critics say Barkley was a Utopian dreamer.</i>

300
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,244
<i>They point out that the research</i>
<i>he was involved with</i>

301
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:20,581

302
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:37,181
Paul.

303
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:39,850
Shannon!

304
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,271
What's going on?

305
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,232
Tell me about the money, Eddie.

306
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:48,400
What money?

307
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:51,486
The $250,000 the FBI found in your loft.

308
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,365
I don't know what you're talking about.

309
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:58,452
What about the burst transmitter?
Think hard.

310
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,539
Jesus...

311
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:05,918
I suppose you're not in communication
with Dr Chen in China?

312
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,878
It wasn't Chen.

313
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,255
- Do you have an attorney?
- No.

314
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,424
I've got a good one.

315
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:16,220
He'll negotiate your surrender.
Come on. We'll call him.

316
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,931
- Surrender?
- They'll want to talk to you.

317
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:21,016
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?

318
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,727
- We didn't do anything.
- The FBI will figure that out.

319
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,523
We're being set up. I'm not going
to the cops until I know more.

320
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:31,610
Run, and you'll have
every gun-carrying idiot in the US after you.

321
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,903
Look,

322
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:34,821
talk to this lawyer.

323
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:36,990
We'll go somewhere safe

324
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,493
- and wait until you work it out.
- Where?

325
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,411
Maggie's.

326
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:43,205
We'll go to Maggie's.

327
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,917
OK. Have you got any money?

328
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,961
- $40.
- All right.

329
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,087
Here.

330
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,591
When you get there, stay put.
Don't use the phone. I'll call you.

331
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,598
Why is this happening, Paul?

332
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,601
It's gonna be all right, Eddie.

333
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:06,770
I promise you.

334
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,815
Wait here five minutes, then leave.

335
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,615
What do we know about this Shannon?

336
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:21,910
Georgetown Law,
Kennedy School of Government.

337
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,830
Worked for several aerospace giants.

338
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,374
Three years in Washington
under Reagan...

339
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:29,543
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?
- DARPA.

340
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,129
Defence Advanced Research
Project Administration.

341
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:35,048
Jesus! Who the hell is this guy?

342
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:38,510
He's notjust someone that runs a foundation.

343
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:49,396
There's a train at 8.40
at the Union Station to Williams Bay.

344
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,316
- That's where Maggie lives.
- You can trust her?

345
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,026
We lived and worked together.

346
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:57,112
<i>This is the Channel 32 special report.</i>

347
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,200
<i>We go live to the Federal Office Building</i>
<i>in Chicago.</i>

348
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:05,704
<i>As you know, it's been</i>
<i>a very long and a very trying day for us all.</i>

349
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:10,334
Material witness warrants
have been issued in Illinois

350
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,586
for Professor Lu Chen,

351
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:17,341
<i>Dr Lily Sinclair, and Edward Kasalivich.</i>

352
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,427
Oh, my God!

353
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:25,015
<i>If anyone knows their whereabouts,</i>
<i>please contact the Chicago FBI office.</i>

354
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:28,769
What are we going to do?
We can't leave here together.

355
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:34,525
Get a cab outside. Buy two tickets.

356
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:37,444
Williams Bay. I'll meet you on the track.

357
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:42,533
Be safe.

358
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,368
You too.

359
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:49,706
<i>His body was found...</i>

360
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,876
Hey, Mike, did you see that guy?

361
00:30:01,385 --> 00:30:03,512
Union Station, please.

362
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,231
Hey! Hey, you! Come here.

363
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,192
Hey!

364
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:18,569
Officer!

365
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,447
Hey, buddy!

366
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:26,410
Hey, you!

367
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:49,808
I got him! I got him!

368
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,856
It makes no sense.
If Kasalivich is just a pawn,

369
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,025
why has he got a burst transmitter?

370
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:59,484
What?

371
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,737
He's gotta be transmitting to someone.

372
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,697
- Unbelievable.
- What?

373
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,533
CPD's chasing Kasalivich
down Michigan Avenue.

374
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,303
Stay where you are!

375
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:07,427
He's gonna fall! Get me a boat under there!

376
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,558
What the hell's he doing?

377
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:23,068
He's going over!
Hey! We got guys downstairs?

378
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,503
- What did I tell you? He just went over.
- Stairs, over here.

379
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,886
Listen. How do we get him down?

380
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:52,598
Officer, if I move that bridge, he's gonna fall.

381
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:02,524
- Can he get out lower down?
- Leads down to the gear room.

382
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,110
- Bring the bridge down.
- He'll get crushed.

383
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,362
Ten-four. Bring it down slow.

384
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,973
- Bring the bridge down now!
- Get over there!

385
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:07,798
Hey! What's happening? Why did it stop?

386
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:17,891
Right, I want this cleared.

387
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:20,060
Let's go! Do a search!

388
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,841
Move it, move it!

389
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,551
Go! Go! Right now!

390
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:56,096
You! Back this thing outta here. Come on!

391
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,731
So where the hell is he?

392
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:09,443
<i>Amtrak northbound, no.343,</i>

393

394

<i>Jamesfield and Madison.</i>

396

- God! I didn't think I was gonna make it.
- Watch your step.

397
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,671
Don't worry, he'll be here.

398
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,522
You were right.

399
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,320
What took you so long?

400
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:54,947
The bridge was up.

401
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,741
All aboard!

402
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,556
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

403
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,190
Thank you.

404
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:36,572
Are you sure
she's going to be up this late?

405
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:38,991
Yeah, she's usually up all night.

406
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:42,870
- She's kinda wild.
- Oh.

407
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:45,706
- I worked up here one summer.
- Oh!

408
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:11,231
Maggie.

409
00:37:13,692 --> 00:37:14,776
Maggie!

410
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,321
Oh, my.

411
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:21,992
Tell me you didn't do it, Eddie!

412
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:23,869
I didn't do it.

413
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:29,833
Oh, it's good to see you, man.

414
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:33,253
You must be the other terrorist.

415
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,839
- I guess I am.
- Maggie, this is Lily.

416
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:40,010
Hi, Lily.

417
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,147
- Have a nice trip, Mr Shannon.
- Thank you, Bobby.

418
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:07,663
How did you get me into this hearing?
I don't have this kind of clearance.

419
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:09,665
I know a guy that knows a guy.

420
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,834
- Who?
- It's a guy.

421
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,460
Who's the guy?

422
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:16,588
Doyle, it's national security. I can't tell you.

423
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:19,132
Security concerns must be given

424
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:22,511
greater importance in industrial research.

425
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:25,556
We don't know the cause of the explosion.

426
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:28,600
And we don't know
the source of the espionage,

427
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:31,854
if indeed there was espionage.

428
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:36,692
But we do know that we are at risk.

429
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:42,656
Every idea that offers a competitive
advantage to Americans is subject to theft.

430
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,909
And that, gentlemen, could be catastrophic.

431
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,786
Mr Shannon,

432
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:51,957
over the past ten years,
this committee has approved

433
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,629
hundreds of millions of dollars
for your research projects

434
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:02,885
without having one good,
goddamn idea about where the hell

435
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:05,053
all the money was going.

436
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:08,557
He's talking about our tax dollars up there.

437
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,393
We were under the impression, Senator,

438
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:15,731
that you passed legislation
to ensure that you wouldn't know.

439
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:20,652
Or perhaps, more accurately,
that you didn't want to know.

440
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:24,698
I'm aware of the law, Mr Shannon,
thank you. I wrote it.

441
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:28,952
But I don't remember,
when I drafted it, that I anticipated

442
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:33,916
a large portion
of the south side of Chicago blown up.

443
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:37,878
What assurances can you give me
and this committee

444
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:40,797
that this event will never happen again?

445
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,302
None, Senator.

446
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:50,057
The incident in Chicago was tragic,
to be sure.

447
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,018
But sometimes that is the price we must pay

448
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,854
to ensure our competitive edge in the future.

449
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:59,691
We didn't intend to pay for
our space exploration programme

450
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:03,153
with the lives of ten American astronauts.
But we did.

451
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:07,741
Nevertheless,
we must not waver in our commitment

452
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:10,994
to scientific research and development.

453
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,705
As you gentlemen know,

454
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,792
there are many threats to our way of life.

455
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,336
And not all of them wear uniforms

456
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,296
and carry guns.

457
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,760
Mr Shannon, I want to thank you for your
appearance today before this committee.

458
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:29,304
You have spoken like a true patriot

459
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:31,890
of whom this country can be very proud.

460
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,602
Thank you, sir.

461
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:49,157
- I think I'm getting through.
- What about Lucasz?

462
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:52,494
He never got over
not getting his credentials.

463
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,205
No-one on the team could have done this.

464
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,709
Whoever is doing this
knows an awful lot about us.

465
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:01,670
If I hadn't have shown up,

466
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:05,090
they would have thought it was an accident.

467
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:08,343
And nobody would know
what's really going on.

468
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:12,639
Oh, my God.

469
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:48,926
- Welcome back, boss. We missed you.
- What about me?

470
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:51,428
Surveillance is up on Shannon's estate.

471
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:53,597
Cue it up, Jimmy.

472
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,103
Where are the files
on the Moore Foundation?

473
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,006
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

474
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,258
Shannon's moving.

475
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:22,978
<i>There will be an orientation meeting</i>

476
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,981
<i>in the main auditorium, on level one...</i>

477
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,195
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.

478
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:34,114
- Is it running?
- Not yet.

479
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,130
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

480
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:53,217
FBI. I'm Agent Williams, this is Agent Lim.

481
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,802
So, what kind of facility is this?

482
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:58,764
I'm sorry, sir,
we're not allowed to discuss this.

483
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:13,946
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Bear with me, and we'll soon get started.

484
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:16,114
Thank you.

485
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:20,452
I don't care if he's got
an appointment with Mother Teresa.

486
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:23,830
We have been waiting for him
for 35 minutes.

487
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,958
You're late.

488
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:30,295
This is another one of your messes, Lyman.

489
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:32,256
It's not the Peace Corps, Paul.

490
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:36,176
- Anyway, you said you had it under control.
- I did!

491
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,886
This thing's still not working.

492
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:41,515
You've got to call off the Bureau.

493
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:43,392
Do you understand?

494
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,435
I'm not sure I can do that.

495
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,605
There's an awful lot of explaining to do.

496
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,775
Where's the young man?

497
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,946
Kasalivich?

498
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,950
He's someplace safe.

499
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,119
I'm bringing him in today.

500
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:08,041
Paul!

501
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:13,297
If someone's going down for this,

502
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,674
it is not gonna be I.

503
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,600
Paul Shannon, please.

504
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,603
Maggie McDermott. We're old friends.

505
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:30,230
Washington.

506
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:33,609
Area code's Wisconsin. Checking the prefix.

507
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:34,985
Punch it up.

508
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:43,827
Maggie McDermott. She was
put through from the Chicago office.

509
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,706
Maggie?

510
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,043
Shannon, it's Eddie.

511
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,088
It's scrambled.

512
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:59,468
- It's him, on a payphone in Williams Bay.
- I'll get the locals.

513
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:03,722
- What are you doing?
- It's OK, it's a payphone. That fax...

514
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:05,140
I know about that.

515
00:46:05,224 --> 00:46:07,893
Wait at Maggie's.
I'll send someone for you.

516
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:09,561
Lily tracked it to Beijing.

517
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:11,897
It routed through a Chinese company,

518
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,150
but it came from
the US Technological Business Council.

519
00:46:15,234 --> 00:46:16,735
We've gotta go.

520
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:19,238
- Heard of it?
- They'll be there in an hour.

521
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:21,198
Now, Eddie!

522
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,702
- I gotta go. We'll come to you.
- No, don't.

523
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:27,621
Eddie. Eddie!

524
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:29,289
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

525
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:39,049
Officer. Hey, hey! Andy!

526
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:41,844
You know that guy on the news?
I saw him run up there.

527
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:43,679
Really, Maggie?

528
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:53,063
You should have brought him in
when you had the chance.

529
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,746
Get to the observatory, right away!

530
00:47:28,098 --> 00:47:29,683
Lily! Lily!

531
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:32,352
- Eddie, it's unbelievable.
- We've gotta go.

532
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:36,690
Listen, listen. This council
lobbies for defence contractors...

533
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:40,027
- We've gotta go now. The cops are here.
- What!

534
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,778
Come on!

535
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,947
How did they find us?

536
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:46,825
Hey! Hold it right there.

537
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:48,952
Hey!

538
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:50,787
Hold it! Hey!

539
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:52,539
Stop!

540
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,176
Hold it!

541
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:06,678
Stop! Hold it right there.

542
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:08,805
Get your hands up.

543
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:11,350
Get 'em up!

544
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,188
Walk back slowly towards me.

545
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:18,357
Come on, do it!

546
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:21,276
Keep coming.

547
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:25,989
Good, hold it right there.

548
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,206
This is Nemitz,
on the roof of the observatory.

549
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:35,624
I've got 'em.

550
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,418
Aagh!

551
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:49,137
Go! Go, go, go, go!

552
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:01,608
Come on!

553
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:13,036
On the roof!
Get a medical team up here right away.

554
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,205
Suspect is armed!

555
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,266
Get in the boat!

556
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:39,897
- Eddie, what are you doing?
- Get in!

557
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,457
Eddie, what are you doing?

558
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,959
The best I can.

559
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:02,794
Get the boat!

560
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:05,464
He's on the ice!

561
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:16,475
- Are you OK?
- Yes!

562
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:54,137
He's out of our sight. 12 o'clock.

563
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:07,442
Lily, the bag! Give me the bag.

564
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:11,947
Go, go!

565
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:40,267
There's nobody in there!

566
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:47,774
<i>We need a pollution revolution.</i>

567
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:51,195
I don't care.
Search all of Wisconsin if you have to.

568
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,155
They lost him?

569
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:56,909
We've been to C-Systems.
We can't get any information.

570
00:51:56,992 --> 00:52:01,997
It used to be a government-run facility.
Now county records say it doesn't even exist.

571
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,208
Maybe you weren't really there.

572
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:06,376
Maybe we're not really here.

573
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,905
Eddie, I can't... feel my legs.

574
00:52:34,988 --> 00:52:36,031
Come on.

575
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:45,457
Come on.

576
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,623
We've got fire, we've got fire.

577
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:51,940
Why would a policeman
shoot another policeman?

578
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:56,862
Maybe they weren't police.

579
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:03,493
Why didn't they shoot at us?

580
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:05,954
I don't know.

581
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:17,883
What a dump, huh?

582
00:54:19,176 --> 00:54:21,470
- Mr Shannon.
- What?

583
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,347
Two FBI agents want to see you.

584
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:26,517
This is more important
than his afternoon tea.

585
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:34,983
My apologies for interrupting
your tea, Mr Shannon.

586
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:38,987
- What's Kasalivich doing in Wisconsin?
- Running away from you.

587
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:40,280
We understand he phoned you.

588
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,660
I counselled Eddie
to turn himself in to the authorities.

589
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:49,039
He and Miss Sinclair
shot a Wisconsin state trooper.

590
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:52,167
I doubt that very seriously.

591
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:55,295
Well... the state trooper's very dead.

592
00:54:57,256 --> 00:55:01,677
Mr Shannon, these are copies
of the Moore Foundation IRS files.

593
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,763
Do you know what's in them?

594
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,725
Meagre tax records, I imagine.

595
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:11,228
We are a non-profit organisation.

596
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:17,568
The funding for your foundation
comes from a wide variety of sources.

597
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:21,738
Defence contractors,
telecommunication companies, aerospace.

598
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:24,533
It's gratifying to know
our work is appreciated.

599
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:28,203
The bulk of funding seems to come
from one Cayman Islands account.

600
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:29,913
I don't do the fundraising.

601
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:33,000
Oh, yeah. And the account is classified.

602
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:35,794
Who pays your salary, Mr Shannon?

603
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:38,297
The foundation pays my salary.

604
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,049
Classified accounts,
encrypted phone calls...

605
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:47,264
A man could be forgiven for thinking
that your foundation is a front for the CIA.

606
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:52,477
In that case, there may be national security
issues here that are larger than us all.

607
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:55,606
Obstructing an FBI investigation
is a federal crime.

608
00:55:55,856 --> 00:55:58,650
- I know the law, Mr...
- Doyle.

609
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:05,866
And for dinner tonight,
we have a choice of sardines...

610
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,826
...or sardines.

611
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:11,121
Gosh, I think I'll have... sardines.

612
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:13,290
Sardines. Beautiful choice.

613
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:22,508
So, is this how you seduce all the girls?

614
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:28,764
Only physicists with hypothermia
who are accused of being a terrorist.

615
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,100
Thank you.

616
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:38,273
There's a garage.
I'm going to see what's in there.

617
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:40,651
I won't be long, OK?

618
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,212
Your pit bull has killed
a Wisconsin state trooper.

619
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:01,755
Well, now.

620
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,592
Would you rather the Bureau
got the girl and Kasalivich?

621
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:07,761
First, he was a suspect.

622
00:57:07,845 --> 00:57:11,139
Worst case scenario... they arrest him.

623
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:13,725
Now he's a cop-killer.

624
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:16,395
Worst case scenario, they kill <i>him.</i>

625
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:20,524
For God's sake, what possessed you
to frame him in the first place?

626
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:22,234
Two words.

627
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:24,987
Convenience... and expedience.

628
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,614
He saw too much, he was talking.

629
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:30,742
The poor boy was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

630
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:32,911
I need this poor boy!

631
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:36,456
This poor boy is the only one
who knows the frequencies!

632
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:41,837
Do you understand the concept, Lyman?

633
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:44,840
Poor impulse control?

634
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:51,138
Barkley, Chen, the regulator.
That was supposed to be it!

635
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:53,307
That was all of it!

636
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:57,186
I am sick to death
of cleaning up your messes.

637
00:57:57,269 --> 00:57:59,188
No, Paul, no. Yours.

638
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:01,356
Not mine.

639
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,525
You lost it, Paul.

640
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:06,486
Lost control, perspective.

641
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,947
You made it personal with these people.

642
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:10,449
Well, we'll find them.

643
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:14,870
We'll find them, and when we do
and we've got this thing working,

644
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:16,955
then, my friend, then

645
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,667
this young man will be a liability.

646
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,005
That'll be my problem.

647
00:58:25,088 --> 00:58:28,258
- Our problem.
- No, Lyman.

648
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:30,427
When the time comes,

649
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:33,931
I'll handle it.

650
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:36,350
You'd better.

651
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:23,730
So what does he want us to do?

652
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:26,525
We find him and give him an injection.

653
01:00:35,177 --> 01:00:37,054
Lily.

654
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:39,181
Lily!

655
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:12,881
Come on.

656
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,231
Leesburg, Virginia.

657
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:31,400
C-Systems.

658
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:34,820
Who are they?

659
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:36,280
Not cops.

660
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:38,323
Cops carry badges,

661
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:41,368
credit cards, pictures of their families.

662
01:01:58,468 --> 01:02:01,138
If it's crowded, don't go in.

663
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:03,307
OK.

664
01:02:20,282 --> 01:02:22,284
- Hi!
- Hello.

665
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:24,036
Can I help you?

666
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:28,290
I'd like to send some flowers
and a note to a friend in Virginia.

667
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:34,213
It's a little strange, Mr Shannon,
but these just arrived.

668
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:37,674
I'm not quite sure where they're from.
Here's a note.

669
01:02:37,758 --> 01:02:39,843
May I see that?

670
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,012
Thank you.

671
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:48,644
Hold it right there, buddy.

672
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:50,604
FBI.

673
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:54,149
Step outside the van, please.

674
01:02:55,192 --> 01:02:58,779
Why don't you bring
your invoice sheet out with you?

675
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,952
Do you know if the order
originated at this shop?

676
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:08,330
I don't think so.
I think it was a wire from Georgetown.

677
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,666
- Mind if I take one of these?
- No, sure.

678
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:11,875
Have a nice day.

679
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:16,380
So officially this investigation
is now code-named Steel Bomb.

680
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:19,132
We'll input the data into Rapid Start.

681
01:03:19,216 --> 01:03:22,344
Look what I brought back
from the flower shop.

682
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:24,513
I think this is Kasalivich.

683
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:29,643
Spawn versus Neanderthal man, 4pm today.

684
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:31,979
What is this, a wrestling match?

685
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:33,647
Bad movie, video game?

686
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,066
Spawn, it's a comic-book character.

687
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:40,279
- The guy who comes back from the dead?
- Yeah, like Kasalivich.

688
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:43,031
Maybe Shannon is the Neanderthal man?

689
01:03:43,115 --> 01:03:45,117
Very well may be.

690
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:35,000
Hello, Eddie.

691
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:37,211
Glad you got the flowers.

692
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:38,629
Very clever.

693
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:40,797
Are you all right?

694
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,799
No, not really.

695
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:45,052
I guess I can understand that.

696
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:46,887
We were at Maggie's.

697
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,848
Caught. We were about to be arrested.

698
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:52,226
Somebody shot the cop.

699
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:54,603
Later, two guys tried to kill us.

700
01:04:54,686 --> 01:04:57,648
I've got my car outside. Follow me.

701
01:04:57,731 --> 01:04:59,608
We'll go someplace we can talk.

702
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:02,736
I found this... in one of the guy's wallets.

703
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,198
They weren't cops.

704
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:08,700
What do you know about C-Systems, Paul?

705
01:05:11,328 --> 01:05:14,081
This is not the time or the place, Eddie.

706
01:05:14,164 --> 01:05:15,999
We're being watched.

707
01:05:19,795 --> 01:05:21,171
Eddie,

708
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:24,132
the world isn't as simple
as we'd like it to be.

709
01:05:25,676 --> 01:05:27,594
It just doesn't work that way.

710
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:30,430
Shannon, who are you?

711
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:32,599
I'm your friend, Eddie.

712
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:34,977
I may be your only friend.

713
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,979
Is it you, Paul?

714
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,983
Are you responsible for all this?

715
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,236
Time to go, Eddie.

716
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,405
You've got ajob to complete.

717
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,616
The experiment needs verifying.

718
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:52,786
Do your work... This will all be over.

719
01:05:55,747 --> 01:05:57,749
Eddie, we're beyond that now.

720
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,459
Let's just get this done.

721
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:01,128
Come back to work with me.

722
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,922
You'll have your life back, I promise you.

723
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:05,966
You don't control our lives.

724
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:08,302
You'll have to trust me, Eddie.

725
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:10,429
Just like Alistair?

726
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:26,695
Eddie!

727
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:28,655
Eddie!

728
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:46,757
<i>A trip that normally takes over five hours.</i>

729
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:52,137
<i>But today, you'll experience the events</i>
<i>of that flight in just seven minutes.</i>

730
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:58,185
<i>The crew is preparing for takeoff.</i>

731
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:02,523
<i>Your pilot for today's flight</i>
<i>is Captain Dave Larsen.</i>

732
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:08,445
Stay here.

733
01:07:08,529 --> 01:07:10,864
<i>Our co-pilot is First Officer...</i>

734
01:07:13,784 --> 01:07:16,328
Get in.

735
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:21,250
She's in the hatch.

736
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,627
Look out!

737
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:31,677
<i>The crew are going through</i>
<i>their final pre-flight checks...</i>

738
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:34,930
Eddie!

739
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:39,768
Eddie!
Come on, don't do anything foolish.

740
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:05,961
Get Ford. DC police reported
a disturbance at the Science Museum

741
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:08,463
by the Neanderthal man exhibit.

742
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:53,300
CQ 493... CQ 493.

743
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:09,900
Here you are, darling. Drink this.

744
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:13,237
You're dehydrated.
Wash it out of your system.

745
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:17,324
Mr Collier and I have a few colleagues
we'd like you to meet.

746
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:21,453
Dr Holloway, Dr Hamada, and Dr Orbit.

747
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:27,584
They are very interested
to discuss your work with you.

748
01:09:27,668 --> 01:09:29,753
And, of course, Dr Lu Chen.

749
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,713
Lu.

750
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:50,482
Lily.

751
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:52,442
We would like you and Dr Chen

752
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:55,863
to continue the work
you were doing with Dr Barkley.

753
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:01,994
- You can't be serious!
- Oh, yes.

754
01:10:02,077 --> 01:10:05,873
We've been impressed with your work
for a long time.

755
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:11,503
Do you drug and kidnap everyone
whose work you admire?

756
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:14,047
No.

757
01:10:14,131 --> 01:10:16,800
Dr Barkley, we left behind.

758
01:10:20,137 --> 01:10:22,848
Slay the dreamer, eh, Mr Shannon?

759
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:39,489
You end up sleeping on the street.

760
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:41,700
I can't believe you'd do that.

761
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:48,123
Can you spare some change?
A quarter, what's a quarter?

762
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:50,083
Can't you see me?

763
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:04,264
Can I share your grate?

764
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,312
You make me sick!

765
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,906
We can't go in! We got kicked out!

766
01:11:22,616 --> 01:11:25,285
What are all youse looking at?

767
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:30,415
Let go!

768
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,225
CQ 493.

769
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:07,369
<i>This is Eddie. I think. He does.</i>

770
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:09,538
<i>But he really does.</i>

771
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:12,291
What are you watching?
"Honeymooner" reruns?

772
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:14,710
Kasalivich and Barkley. Look at this.

773
01:12:14,793 --> 01:12:18,255
Does he look like he's about to kill this guy
and blow the place up?

774
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:20,424
The whole thing stinks.

775
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:25,470
We've got the ballistics report back
on that trooper killed in Wisconsin.

776
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:28,724
Teflon sniper round
went through the cop's Kevlar vest.

777
01:12:28,807 --> 01:12:29,933
I don't buy it.

778
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:32,436
He's smart enough to blow up the lab

779
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:36,356
but stupid enough
to leave $250,000 where we'd find it?

780
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,027
Are you saying some cowboy's
gone off the reservation?

781
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:44,239
$100. The kid didn't do it.

782
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:47,951
You've got a nationwide manhunt
for an innocent man.

783
01:12:48,785 --> 01:12:50,871
Make sure nobody shoots him.

784
01:14:12,077 --> 01:14:14,162
Next shift's going down now, OK?

785
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:44,985
Yeah, right.
Help me out on this, will you?

786
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:47,988
I've had problems with the conveyor belt.

787
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:52,075
No, I'll have Jim Zinsky work on that.

788
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,036
OK? All right.

789
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:57,206
If you've got any problems,
call me on channel four.

790
01:15:17,226 --> 01:15:20,229
How is our young charge?
Did she say anything?

791
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:22,397
We'll soon find out, won't we?

792
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:25,567
The young lady
does appear to be cooperating.

793
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:26,818
Good.

794
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:30,155
- Gentlemen, you're just in time.
- Let's get on with it.

795
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,324
Miss Sinclair, Mr Chen,

796
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:34,493
please, have a seat.

797
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:52,219
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

798
01:15:52,302 --> 01:15:56,014
<i>Critical path experiment</i>
<i>will commence in ten minutes.</i>

799
01:15:56,306 --> 01:15:59,434
<i>Critical path experiment</i>
<i>will commence in ten minutes.</i>

800
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:01,603
<i>Level five.</i>

801
01:16:12,531 --> 01:16:14,867
Activate the H2 compressor.

802
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,035
On... on automatic.

803
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,121
Here we go.

804
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:24,626
Lucasz, what are you reading?

805
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:27,838
- Two million kelvin.
- Activate the laser.

806
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:34,803
Four million kelvin.

807
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:49,151
You don't have it. It's unstable.

808
01:16:49,234 --> 01:16:51,612
Shut it down! Shut it down!

809
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:57,951
Dammit! What ajoke.

810
01:16:58,035 --> 01:17:01,246
It won't work without the right frequencies.

811
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:04,166
What did he say?

812
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:07,836
He said that's what he's been
trying to tell you for days.

813
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,881
Look. Let's try it again in the morning, OK?

814
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:15,511
- See you back here at 8.15 tomorrow?
- I have a feeling, Dr Sinclair,

815
01:17:15,594 --> 01:17:17,596
the solution will present itself.

816
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,515
I doubt it.

817
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:21,016
It had better

818
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:24,186
or your usefulness will soon be outlived.

819
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:26,772
Take them back to their room.

820
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:32,903
I wish you wouldn't threaten
to kill my scientists to their faces.

821
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:35,072
It might make my job easier.

822
01:17:36,156 --> 01:17:38,242
Lucasz, Hamada, seal the lab!

823
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:42,162
I want to see those printouts
first thing in the morning.

824
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:30,062
- It's working?
- Yes.

825
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:32,856
- How?
- Lucasz claims he figured it out.

826
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:35,609
Lucasz?

827
01:19:35,692 --> 01:19:37,778
That's his story.

828
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:58,048
When I got here, the output
was going right through the roof!

829
01:19:58,131 --> 01:20:00,217
Son of a bitch!

830
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:03,846
It really does work. Ha!

831
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:06,723
Dr Shannon, take a look at that.

832
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,643
We've got it.

833
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:17,234
What did you do?

834
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:19,319
Nothing.

835
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:21,905
I couldn't sleep last night, sir.

836
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:23,740
I heard this voice saying,

837
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:26,243
go and check different frequencies

838
01:20:26,326 --> 01:20:29,288
because we were trying
on 15 and 20 megahertz.

839
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:32,624
So I went down to the lab
and ran the experiment

840
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,960
and it all worked out.

841
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:37,296
So... here we are, sir.

842
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:42,259
Did you document
the regulator frequencies?

843
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,428
Not yet.

844
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:47,514
I'd like those on a disk... Now, sir.

845
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:52,853
None too shabby, hey, Mr Shannon?

846
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:58,442
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

847
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,319
Where are you going, Paul?

848
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:03,822
I'm going to check this
against the Chicago data.

849
01:21:08,327 --> 01:21:10,495
I'll try to meet you at the silo.

850
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:12,998
- Wait as long as you can.
- Yes, sir.

851
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:32,392
Hello, Eddie!

852
01:21:32,476 --> 01:21:34,561
I figured it was you.

853
01:21:34,645 --> 01:21:37,231
Nice place you have here, Shannon.

854
01:21:37,314 --> 01:21:39,441
Ten-megajoule lasers.

855
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:41,443
Particle reactors.

856
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:45,072
Congress de-funded
most of the stuff here years ago.

857
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:47,449
They made a mistake.

858
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:50,035
Is this part of the Moore Foundation?

859
01:21:50,118 --> 01:21:51,703
In a manner of speaking.

860
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:53,622
Power and money.

861
01:21:53,705 --> 01:21:55,874
Is that what this was all about?

862
01:21:57,251 --> 01:22:00,295
I'm afraid it's more complicated than that.

863
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:04,216
He was a 60-year-old scientist
who did nothing but good

864
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:06,385
and they put a bag over his head.

865
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:08,554
It was a mistake.

866
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:13,559
I didn't want anything
to happen to Alistair.

867
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,812
But a decision had to be made.

868
01:22:16,895 --> 01:22:18,981
So...

869
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:20,941
Who made the decision?

870
01:22:21,024 --> 01:22:24,444
- You?
- That's my job.

871
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:26,613
That's what I'm paid to do.

872
01:22:26,697 --> 01:22:28,782
I'm paid to do dirty work.

873
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,536
Work people don't want to know about.

874
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:35,080
People want to live in split-level homes.

875
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:37,708
They want microwave dinners
and colour TV.

876
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:39,585
Is that what you think?

877
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,965
Alistair was a dreamer.

878
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:48,260
Clean air, free energy.

879
01:22:48,343 --> 01:22:50,179
Noble concepts

880
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:53,932
but we live on a planet
that is addicted to petroleum.

881
01:22:54,016 --> 01:22:57,311
What happens if you dump
free energy onto the market?

882
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:59,980
World stock markets would plummet.

883
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:02,191
Our own economy would collapse.

884
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:03,775
Recession,

885
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:07,112
unemployment, war.

886
01:23:07,196 --> 01:23:09,781
The world is speeding up too fast now, Eddie.

887
01:23:09,865 --> 01:23:11,950
We can barely hold on as it is.

888
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:15,287
You're right, it's not working.

889
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:17,664
So we've got to try something else.

890
01:23:17,748 --> 01:23:20,417
Not bury the technology, but let it out.

891
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:24,671
You let it out, but you let it out
at a pace the world can absorb.

892
01:23:24,755 --> 01:23:26,423
It can absorb it now.

893
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:30,219
There's our boy.

894
01:23:30,302 --> 01:23:32,387
Mr Kasalivich!

895
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:34,556
How kind of you to join us.

896
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,267
Give us a moment, Lyman.

897
01:23:37,351 --> 01:23:40,020
Eddie and I are having a conversation.

898
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:41,939
Please! Don't let me stop you!

899
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:45,317
Who runs this place, Shannon? You?

900
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,611
- Or the guy with the guns?
- Well,

901
01:23:47,694 --> 01:23:49,780
we are a cooperative

902
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:51,949
of sorts.

903
01:23:52,032 --> 01:23:55,494
Run at the behest
of the United States government.

904
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:57,579
But without their knowledge, right?

905
01:23:57,663 --> 01:24:01,667
My, my, but your friend is sharp, Paul.

906
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,252
All right, Eddie.

907
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:05,629
What do you want?

908
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:11,593
There are the specs for the regulator.

909
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:14,721
You can pull the frequencies
off the computer.

910
01:24:14,805 --> 01:24:16,139
Now let us go.

911
01:24:16,223 --> 01:24:20,102
I get it to work. You give us our lives back.

912
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:22,479
That was the deal, wasn't it?

913
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,025
Yeah.

914
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:29,194
Yeah, that was the deal.

915
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:33,198
I'm afraid, young man,
your position is non-negotiable.

916
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:35,367
I see.

917
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:44,543
I want to tell you this story
how I got inspired.

918
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:47,379
- I had this dream...
- No!

919
01:24:47,462 --> 01:24:48,422
Hold on.

920
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:50,591
I will continue.

921
01:24:56,847 --> 01:24:58,932
What's happening?

922
01:25:08,358 --> 01:25:09,943
What did you just do?

923
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:13,113
I just told the FBI I was willing to surrender.

924
01:25:13,197 --> 01:25:17,868
Oh, and er... I think your experiment
just got a mind of its own.

925
01:25:26,251 --> 01:25:28,337
Check the breakers.

926
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,589
Everybody, back to your stations!

927
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:38,680
What the hell's going on, Doyle?

928
01:25:38,764 --> 01:25:41,725
It started a few minutes ago...
hundreds of pages.

929
01:25:41,808 --> 01:25:45,395
Technical drawings,
experiment specs, budgets,

930
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:49,441
personnel records, minutes,
mostly marked top secret.

931
01:25:49,525 --> 01:25:51,902
- Where's it coming from?
- C-Systems.

932
01:25:51,985 --> 01:25:55,405
It's like they dumped their mainframe
into our computers.

933
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:58,116
Here's a special love note just for you.

934
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,077
Jesus Christ, Kasalivich.

935
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,622
He's in a bunker in Leesburg
with his bomb-making buddies

936
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:05,374
and wants us to arrest him.

937
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:09,169
- Lake Geneva Radical Bomb Network?
- Sound like bullshit?

938
01:26:09,253 --> 01:26:11,171
It sounds like you owe me $100.

939
01:26:11,255 --> 01:26:14,174
Make sure that fax doesn't run out of paper.

940
01:26:14,383 --> 01:26:16,343
- Hamada!
- Still off-line!

941
01:26:16,426 --> 01:26:19,763
- Pressure?
- 500 psi and rising.

942
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:22,432
What the hell's going on?

943
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:26,728
We've lost control of the system, Lyman.
We can't shut it down.

944
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:32,234
Turn it off.

945
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:35,320
It's self-sustaining. It can't be shut down.

946
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:39,074
Al! How long before
we run out of storage capacity?

947
01:26:39,157 --> 01:26:41,159
I don't know. It's accelerating.

948
01:26:41,243 --> 01:26:43,412
- 20 minutes before it blows?
- Maybe less.

949
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:45,664
- Is he right?
- I'm afraid he is.

950
01:26:51,962 --> 01:26:53,839
Well done, Eddie.

951
01:26:54,006 --> 01:26:55,674
Well done.

952
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:02,055
You wouldn't blow it up
if you weren't sure you'd get out alive.

953
01:27:02,139 --> 01:27:04,391
Sure I would.

954
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:09,396
Lyman, I think it's time
we got the hell out of here.

955
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:16,278
- No!
- Chen!

956
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:18,405
- Lily!
- Chen!

957
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:20,157
For God's sake, Lyman!

958
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,992
Chen! Chen!

959
01:27:23,744 --> 01:27:24,536
Wait!

960
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,872
- Jesus Christ!
- What is wrong with you?

961
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:30,375
- Turn it off!
- That was totally unnecessary.

962
01:27:30,459 --> 01:27:33,837
If you haven't got the stomach for this,
stay out of the way.

963
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:35,672
I'm going to turn down the power.

964
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:38,300
- No!
- Don't touch that!

965
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:39,968
Don't!

966
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,728
<i>Hydrogen containment failure.</i>

967
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:51,688
<i>Potential personnel hazard.</i>

968
01:27:51,772 --> 01:27:55,067
- The compressor's just shut down.
- Turn it back on!

969
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:58,278
- You can't.
- The computers are down.

970
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:01,240
Get out!

971
01:28:01,323 --> 01:28:03,367
Get out! Everybody!

972
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:06,954
- Fix it.
- I can't now.

973
01:28:07,037 --> 01:28:09,289
- Fix it!
- I can't!

974
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:12,209
I wouldn't do that, Lyman.

975
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:14,837
It will ignite the hydrogen.

976
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,006
It's over, Lyman. It's over.

977
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,592
I guess it's time to go.

978
01:28:20,676 --> 01:28:23,178
Go! Go!

979
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:26,265
Give me the disk.

980
01:28:26,974 --> 01:28:28,475
You two, stay!

981
01:28:28,559 --> 01:28:31,311
No, Lyman! Let them go!

982
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:34,648
What possible difference can it make now?

983
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:37,901
- They stay!
- When does it end, Lyman?

984
01:28:37,985 --> 01:28:39,111
Never.

985
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:41,280
Well, it's not your decision.

986
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:44,283
The decision is mine,
and I say they're coming.

987
01:28:45,576 --> 01:28:48,537
You can stay with them... if you like.

988
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,913
We must go now.

989
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,166
Well, are you coming?

990
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,629
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

<i>Air contaminants at critical level.</i>

992
01:29:00,382 --> 01:29:03,552
Come on, Paul! We've got things to do!

993
01:29:06,513 --> 01:29:08,265
I'm sorry, Eddie.

994
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:32,247
- Shannon!
- Shannon!

995
01:29:32,331 --> 01:29:34,374
Please!

996

<i>All containment doors are now closed.</i>

1000
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:00,150
The tanks.

1001
01:30:00,234 --> 01:30:03,111
OK, here's the elevator.

1002
01:30:03,195 --> 01:30:05,280
There's room for everybody.

1003
01:30:08,825 --> 01:30:10,869
I'm looking for two men.

1004
01:30:10,953 --> 01:30:13,914
Paul Shannon and Lyman Collier.
Hang onto them.

1005
01:30:13,997 --> 01:30:17,835
<i>Follow the blue evacuation route arrows</i>
<i>to the elevators.</i>

1006
01:30:17,918 --> 01:30:21,421
<i>Move in an orderly fashion</i>
<i>quickly and quietly...</i>

1007
01:30:21,505 --> 01:30:23,799
Our friends from the FBI
will be here presently.

1008
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:25,926
Anita, we're on our way.

1009
01:30:26,009 --> 01:30:29,972
You two go to the north elevator.
I'll take it from here.

1010
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:16,476
Come on! Come on, Lily.

1011
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:19,188
Eddie, which way?

1012
01:31:26,486 --> 01:31:29,072
By the way, Paul, do you have that disk?

1013
01:31:29,156 --> 01:31:31,366
The one with the magic frequency?

1014
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,535
Thank you so much.

1015
01:31:56,433 --> 01:31:59,686
You know, Paul,
maybe it's time to call it a day.

1016
01:32:00,437 --> 01:32:02,814
Maybe you're getting too old for this.

1017
01:32:02,898 --> 01:32:04,358
What do you think, huh?

1018
01:32:04,983 --> 01:32:07,069
But then again

1019
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:08,987
what would we do?

1020
01:32:09,071 --> 01:32:11,156
What would we do?

1021
01:32:52,322 --> 01:32:54,408
I didn't tell you, Lyman,

1022
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:57,744
but your retirement
had already been arranged.

1023
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:17,764
<i>Containment systems off.</i>

1024
01:33:19,391 --> 01:33:22,811
<i>Access restored to all areas.</i>

01:33:22,895 --> 01:33:24,980
<i>Containment systems off.</i>

1026
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:34,198
Hey, hold on, hold on!

1027
01:33:34,281 --> 01:33:35,616
Take it up, take it up!

1028
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:56,303
They got a 20 on Kasalivich?

1029
01:33:56,386 --> 01:34:00,015
They found the stolen truck
at the construction site nearby.

1030
01:34:02,226 --> 01:34:04,311
Hold on.

1031
01:34:08,398 --> 01:34:09,858
Eddie, look.

1032
01:34:34,299 --> 01:34:36,760
Get up. Come on, Reed. We've gotta go!

1033
01:34:53,318 --> 01:34:56,029
I thought you said the hole was clear!

1034
01:34:56,113 --> 01:34:58,198
Get back in the seat, Ernie.

1035
01:35:04,788 --> 01:35:06,874
Eddie.

1036
01:35:37,487 --> 01:35:39,364
Lily, get in the basket!

1037
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:44,828
Get out of here. Go!

1038
01:35:45,996 --> 01:35:47,915
Eddie, come on!

1039
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:51,126
Eddie!

1040
01:36:04,932 --> 01:36:07,476
Hold on, hold on, Eddie.

1041
01:36:21,448 --> 01:36:22,741
Come on, Eddie.

1042
01:36:36,463 --> 01:36:37,714
Aagh!

1043
01:36:37,798 --> 01:36:40,634
Come on, Eddie. Come on!

1044
01:36:57,526 --> 01:36:58,902
Pull it up, pull it up.

1045
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:03,740
Holy... did you see that?

1046
01:37:03,824 --> 01:37:05,576
Whoa!

1047
01:37:05,659 --> 01:37:07,452
Come on, get him out of there.

1048
01:38:19,942 --> 01:38:21,568
Eddie Kasalivich.

1049
01:38:21,652 --> 01:38:24,112
Agent Ford. You got the message.

1050
01:38:24,196 --> 01:38:26,573
Yeah, we levelled a forest printing it.

1051
01:38:26,657 --> 01:38:28,617
What's it mean, Eddie?

1052
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:32,287
- Plans for clean, cheap energy.
- Anybody else get this?

1053
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:34,957
Hopefully, a few thousand top scientists.

1054
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:38,085
- I knew I liked this kid.
- Yeah, right, Leon.

1055
01:38:38,168 --> 01:38:38,627
Come on.

1056
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,838
You've got some questions to answer

1057
01:38:40,921 --> 01:38:42,923
in Washington for about six weeks.

1058
01:38:43,006 --> 01:38:45,509
- That's OK.
- We've got a lot to talk about

1059
01:38:45,592 --> 01:38:48,136
as long as everyone stops shooting at us.

1060
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:50,931
Doyle, spilt 'em up.
I'll meet you at the office.

1061
01:38:51,014 --> 01:38:52,140
Ford!

1062
01:38:53,725 --> 01:38:56,645
Doctor Sinclair and I ride together.

1063
01:38:57,855 --> 01:39:00,023
All right, come on, both of you.

1064
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:20,669
Anita,

1065
01:39:20,752 --> 01:39:22,588
take a memo.

1066
01:39:22,671 --> 01:39:24,756
To the Director of Central Intelligence.

1067
01:39:25,883 --> 01:39:27,968
C-Systems...

1068
01:39:29,595 --> 01:39:31,763
no longer a viable entity.

1069
01:39:33,765 --> 01:39:36,018
Will be in contact.

1070
01:39:36,101 --> 01:39:38,187
That's it.
